J. Abrams & Matt Reeves. Abrams and Reeves share executive producer duties with Brian Grazer, Tony Krantz, Jennifer Levin, Ron Howard, John Eisendrath & Laurie McCarthy. It was produced by Touchstone Television (now known as ABC Studios) and Imagine Television. The series first aired on September 29, 1998, and ended on May 22, 2002 after four seasons on The WB. The series revolves around the fictional college experiences of the title character, Felicity Porter (portrayed by Keri Russell), as she attends the \\"University of New York\\" (based on New York University). While Felicity works to sort out her emotions, she continues the basic motions of student life and moves into her dorm. There, she meets the resident advisor Noel Crane (Scott Foley). Eventually, romance ensues, and the relationships among Felicity, Ben, and Noel form the basic dramatic conflicts in the show throughout the series. A number of other characters appear and play large roles in Felicity's life, including her close-knit group of roommates and friends. A recurring episode opener of the show is a stark camera shot of Felicity sitting in a dormitory room or apartment holding a tape recorder, recalling events in order to make a cassette tape to send to an old friend named Sally Reardon (voiced by Janeane Garofalo). This occasionally provides a method for Felicity to narrate an entire episode. At the end of episodes like this, Felicity is often shown to be listening to a tape that Sally has sent in reply. In 2007, Felicity was one of Time magazine's \\"100 Best TV Shows of All-Time.\\" AOL TV named Felicity one of the \\"Best School Shows of All Time.\\" In June 2010, Entertainment Weekly named Felicity Porter one of the \\"100 Greatest Characters of the Last 20 Years\\". Over the course of four seasons, Felicity aired a total of 84 episodes. Each season corresponds to the traditional American university divisions of freshman, sophomore, junior, and senior years. ==Series overviewEpisodesSeason 1 (1998–1999)=Season 2 (1999–2000)=Season 3 (2000–2001)=Season 4 (2001–2002)=ReferencesExternal links== * Episode list for Felicity * Category:Lists of American teen drama television series episodes ","title":"List of Felicity episodes"},{"id":"20510680","text":"Fabrício Ramos Melo (born June 13, 1986) is a Brazilian footballer who plays for Águia de Marabá. ==References== Category:1986 births Category:Living people Category:Brazilian footballers Category:Brazilian expatriate footballers Category:Brazilian expatriate sportspeople in Turkey Category:Association football midfielders Category:Paysandu Sport Club players Category:Sertãozinho Futebol Clube players Category:Associação Desportiva Cabofriense players Category:Bursaspor footballers Category:Boavista Sport Club players Category:Águia de Marabá Futebol Clube players Category:Associação Atlética Anapolina players Category:Paragominas Futebol Clube players Category:Independente Futebol Clube players Category:Tuna Luso Brasileira players Category:Clube do Remo players ","title":"Fabrício Ramos Melo"},{"id":"20510713","text":"Gillian Wigmore (born 1976) is a Canadian poet and fiction writer. Wigmore was born and raised near Vanderhoof, British Columbia. Her mother, an English teacher, and her library of contemporary Canadian poets helped her develop her poetry in the eco-poetry genre. As a vet and a father of four children, her father often took her on outcalls to farms, where she developed her passion for nature and its many intricacies. She improved her skills in the writing program at the University of Victoria and graduated in 1999 with a double major in Writing and in English. Wigmore published her first chapbook, home when it moves you in 2005, followed by her first book of poetry, Soft Geography in 2007. Some of her success can be attributed to the poetics of Derk Wynand, who taught her to notice every detail and to take writing seriously. Wigmore was a finalist for the 2008 Dorothy Livesay Poetry Prize and won the 2008 ReLit Poetry Award. In 2014 her first fiction, Grayling (a novella), was published by Mother Tongue. The novella follows a couple as they descend the Dease River in northwestern BC. She currently lives in Prince George, British Columbia with her two young children. == Wigmore and the environment == As a child, Wigmore spent time with animals her veterinarian father treated, and in effect dedicated many poems to her experiences with these animals. Instead of manicured or censored language, she creates raw and lively descriptions of barn smells, sensations of cow calves she held and the sight of her father treating these animals. Soft Geography has been described as a \\"detailed poetic map and guide to life in Northern British Columbia\\". She writes about the landscape, flora and fauna, climate and attitudes of the people who inhabit the area, focussing on her experiences in its midst. Her descriptions show attention to natural details and her passion for the environment. She identifies native plant species of British Columbia by name. She compares natural processes in the wild to events in society and to the mannerisms of Northern British Columbians. Wigmore draws attention to the fragility of the natural world and its many ecosystems with examples of how it has been altered by humans. She speaks of the contrasts between the natural and the unnatural, emphasizing the power of the natural world over human creations and society. == Works == * 2005 home when it moves you * 2007 Soft Geography * Published in CV2, filling station, the Inner Harbour Review, Geist Magazine and other Canadian publications. == References == * Carscadden, Martha. \\"News & Events.\\" Gillian Wigmore Wins 2008 ReLit Poetry Award > News > BC Book Prizes. 25 July 2008.

Henri-Pierre Danloux (February 24, 1753 – January 3, 1809) was a French painter and draftsman. He was born in Paris. Brought up by his architect uncle, Danloux was a pupil of Lépicié and later of Vien, whom he followed to Rome in 1775. In 1783, he returned to Lyon and Paris, where he was patroned by the Baronne Mégret de Sérilly d'Etigny, who secured for him a number of important portrait commissions exclusively for the aristocracy. He emigrated to London in 1792 thereby escaping the French Revolution and its potential consequences. While in England, he was commissioned for portraits of the officer class and the well-to-do. Members of one such family, the Lamberts of Oxfordshire, engaged the master in 1800 and had sittings for its individual members: father, mother and son (Henry John Lambert, Bt.), himself, later in life, serving in the Grenadier Regiment of Foot Guards, a Deputy Lieutenant for Oxfordshire and High Sheriff [Peter Lambert from a letter - Pawsey & Payne, 1973]. Danloux, returned to Paris in 1801, there resuming his career. Danloux was influenced by fashionable English portrait painters such as Thomas Lawrence (1769–1830), John Hoppner (1758–1810), and George Romney (1734–1802). In 1793, he exhibited at the Royal Academy in London which resulted in commissions from a number of British patrons. Danloux died in Paris in 1809. ==See also== * The Skating Minister ==References== Pawsey & Payne, Fine Art Dealers: Valuations and Restoration, 1 Bury Street, St. James's, London S.W.

The theory was explained in Alexander William Bickerton's book The Romance of the Heavens published in 1901. It is not part of contemporary astrophysics. In The Romance of the Heavens Bickerton states that a slight \\"grazing\\" collision between stars would be much more common than a head on impact between stars. So he believed this phenomenon needed to be explained to account for the appearance of bright new stars that would appear in the night sky and disappear within a year or even days. The theory explains that when the two stellar bodies graze each other, the grazed parts will shear off from the main body of each star. Their velocity will cancel each other's out transforming this energy into heat. While the main mass of each star will continue moving as they did before the collision. The third body created from the two sheared parts of the stars will form between the two original stars. The temporary star expands after the impact displaying an intense increase in light, after all molecular reactions have taken place the light is replaced by a hollow shell of gas or possibly a planetary nebula, and eventually dissipates into space. Bickerton explains this bright temporary star by saying that it doesn't disappear due to cooling, but that it was too hot to hold together. The temperature of the third star, isn't dependent on the amount of contact between the two original stars, but rather the chemical makeup of the stars and their velocities going into the collision. The stability of the third body depends on the size of the contact of the original stars, if the contact was small then the mass of the newly created third body will find it harder to attract molecules to it. Rather than if it had a larger mass where molecules would find it more difficult to escape from its larger gravitational pull.Bickerton, A.W, (1901).The Romance of the Heavens. London.

Originally released in 1973 by Impulse! Records, it marks the beginning of the relationship between the label and the artist. The tracks were recorded live at the Village Vanguard on February 24, 1973 by the then- still-not-known as Jarrett's \\"American Quartet\\", Dewey Redman, Charlie Haden, Paul Motian plus Danny Johnson. The title of the album is an anagram of the phrase \\"Fourth Way.\\" == Background == At the time the recording was made, Danny Johnson had never worked as a professional musician. In an interview led by Ethan Iverson bassist Charlie Haden said that Johnson was \\"a great, great painter, and a great friend, and someone who was at EVERY gig, and one day he suddenly asked to sit in with us at the Village Vanguard. Keith asked, “What do you play?” “Triangle!” said Danny Johnson. Keith said yes and Danny came down with a big oriental rug and sat like a sitar player with his triangle. And that was the night we recorded Fort Yawuh.\\" One year later Johnson joined the group again on percussion (along Guilherme Franco) - this time for the studio recording of Treasure Island. ==Critical reception== Reviewing for Creem in 1974, Robert Christgau said that, while side one sounds like cluttered free jazz at first, it is in fact highlighted by the Ornette Coleman-like playing of saxophonist Dewey Redman. He found side two more accessible because of drummer Paul Motian's performance during \\"De Drums\\" and the attractive composition of \\"Still Life Still Life\\". In a retrospective review, Allmusic's Qa'id Jacobs wrote, \\"Fans of Jarrett's avant-garde liberalism will find 'De Drums' to be the track most unlike the other four selections on this album.

Also, this would be the final season for wide receiver Bob Hayes (who would finish his career with the San Francisco 49ers the following year); running back Calvin Hill (who departed for the Hawaiians of the World Football League); defensive end Pat Toomay (who left for the Buffalo Bills); guard John Niland (who left the following year for the Philadelphia Eagles) and quarterback Craig Morton (traded early in the season to the New York Giants) in a Cowboy uniform. ==OffseasonDraft=== https://www.pro-football- reference.com/draft/1974.htm ==Schedule== {  style=\\"text- align:center\\" - ! style=\\"\\" Week ! style=\\"\\" Date ! style=\\"\\" Opponent ! style=\\"\\" Result ! style=\\"\\" Record ! style=\\"\\" Game Site ! style=\\"\\" Attendance ! style=\\"\\" Recap -style=\\"background: #cfc\\" ! 1  September 15  at Atlanta Falcons  W 24–0  1–0  Atlanta Stadium  52,332  Recap -style=\\"background: #fcc\\" ! 2   at Philadelphia Eagles  L 10–13  1–1  Veterans Stadium  64,089  Recap -style=\\"background: #fcc\\" ! 3  September 29  New York Giants  L 6–14  1–2  Texas Stadium  45,841  Recap -style=\\"background: #fcc\\" ! 4  October 6  Minnesota Vikings  L 21–23  1–3  Texas Stadium  57,847  Recap -style=\\"background: #fcc\\" ! 5  October 13  at St. Louis Cardinals  L 28–31  1–4  Busch Memorial Stadium  49,885  Recap -style=\\"background: #cfc\\" ! 6  October 20  Philadelphia Eagles  W 31–24  2–4  Texas Stadium  43,586  Recap -style=\\"background: #cfc\\" ! 7  October 27  at New York Giants  W 21–7  3–4  Yale Bowl  57,381  Recap -style=\\"background: #cfc\\" ! 8  November 3  St. Louis Cardinals  W 17–14  4–4  Texas Stadium  64,146  Recap -style=\\"background: #cfc\\" ! 9  November 10  San Francisco 49ers  W 20–14  5–4  Texas Stadium  50,018  Recap -style=\\"background: #fcc\\" ! 10  November 17  at Washington Redskins  L 21–28  5–5  RFK Stadium  54,395  Recap -style=\\"background: #cfc\\" ! 11  November 24  at Houston Oilers  W 10–0  6–5  Houston Astrodome  49,775  Recap -style=\\"background: #cfc\\" ! 12  November 28  Washington Redskins  W 24–23  7–5  Texas Stadium  63,243  Recap -style=\\"background: #cfc\\" ! 13   Cleveland Browns  W 41–17  8–5  Texas Stadium  48,754  Recap -style=\\"background: #fcc\\" ! 14   at Oakland Raiders  L 23–27  8–6  Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum  45,840  Recap } Division opponents are in bold text https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/dal/1974.htm ==Game summariesWeek 3 vs Giants=Week 6 vs Eagles=Week 12 vs Redskins=== Thanksgiving Day Roger Staubach was knocked out of the game. ==StandingsRoster== { class=\\"toccolours\\" style=\\"text-align: left;\\" - ! colspan=\\"7\\" c5ced6; color:black; border: 2px solid #001942; text-align: center;\\"Dallas Cowboys 1974 roster -  style=\\"font-size: 95%;\\" valign=\\"top\\"  Quarterbacks * 19 Clint Longley * 12 Roger Staubach Running Backs * 21 Doug Dennison * 32 Walt Garrison FB * 35 Calvin Hill * 37 Dennis Morgan PR * 44 Robert Newhouse FB * 40 Les Strayhorn * 30 Charley Young Wide Receivers * 22 Bob Hayes * 86 Bill Houston * 88 Drew Pearson * 83 Golden Richards Tight Ends * 89 Billy Joe DuPree * 84 Jean Fugett * 87 Ron Howard  style=\\"width: 25px;\\"   style=\\"font-size: 95%;\\" valign=\\"top\\" Offensive Linemen * 64 Jim Arneson G * 62 John Fitzgerald C * 60 Gene Killian G * 51 Dave Manders C * 73 Ralph Neely T * 76 John Niland G * 61 Blaine Nye G * 78 Bruce Walton T * 70 Rayfield Wright T Defensive Linemen * 63 Larry Cole DE * 77 Bill Gregory DT * 72 Ed Jones DE * 74 Bob Lilly DT * Jeff Hewitt DT * 79 Harvey Martin DE * 75 Jethro Pugh DT * 67 Pat Toomay DE  style=\\"width: 25px;\\"   style=\\"font-size: 95%;\\" valign=\\"top\\" Linebackers * 52 Dave Edwards OLB * 59 Ken Hutcherson MLB * 55 Lee Roy Jordan MLB * 50 D.

He is known as a super-sub amongst Leyton Orient fans, having scored nine goals after the 85th minute of various matches since he joined the club. ==Club career== Téhoué was born in Paris. He previously played for SC Bastia in France, APOEL in Cyprus, R.E. Virton and FC Brussels in Belgium. He transferred to Kasımpaşa S.K. in August 2007 and moved to Konyaspor in February 2008. ===Huddersfield Town=== After a successful trial, English Football League One club Huddersfield Town signed him subject to international clearance on 2 February 2009, but, because of a contractual dispute between Téhoué and Konyaspor, this was not forthcoming. FIFA became involved, but no decision was reached in time for the deal to be completed in the 2008–09 season. ===Leyton Orient=== Upon leaving Konyaspor, Téhoué had a short spell with French side UJA Alfortville. On 12 January 2010, he was signed by League One club Leyton Orient on a short-term contract until the end of the 2009–10 season after impressing on a trial with the club.O's Complete Tehoue Transfer On 2 February 2010, Téhoué scored his first goal in English football, converting Sean Thornton's cross from close range to score the fifth in Orient's 5–0 win over Bristol Rovers. On 12 March 2010, he signed a 2½-year deal with the club which would keep him at The O's until 2012. Téhoué scored his first goal of the 2010–11 season against Hartlepool United on 16 October 2010, smashing home from six yards in the 89th minute to earn the O's a 1–0 victory. On 7 December 2010, Téhoué scored a late equaliser in the FA Cup Second Round against Droylsden and went on to complete a hat-trick in extra- time. His teammate Scott McGleish also achieved a hat-trick in extra-time, ultimately guiding Orient to an 8–2 victory and a place in the third round. On 20 February 2011, Téhoué came off the bench to score the late equaliser in Orient's fifth round 1–1 draw against Arsenal to earn Leyton Orient a replay at the Emirates Stadium. After four months out with a broken wrist, Tehoue made his comeback with two goals in his first two games, coming on as a substitute to score in the 74th minute to round off a 3-0 win against Exeter before netting Orient's second against Notts County in the 85th minute (again as a sub). ===Swindon Town=== On 7 March 2012, Téhoué went on loan to Swindon Town until the end of the season, stating that he did not get on well with Orient manager Russell Slade, and that he hoped to stay at Swindon and score against Orient in League One the following season. However, after one start and two substitute appearances for the Robins, manager Paolo Di Canio said that Téhoué would not play for the club again, claiming, \\"He's not as good as I thought he was.\\" ==Personal life== Contrary to reports, Téhoué is not related to former Arsenal defender Emmanuel Eboué. Téhoué has confirmed that they are just good friends and share Ivorian heritage. He is also friends with the many French players in the Arsenal squad, such as Abou Diaby, and has known Alex Song since they played together at SC Bastia. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:Living people Category:1984 births Category:French footballers Category:Footballers from Paris Category:Association football forwards Category:Stade Malherbe Caen players Category:SC Bastia players Category:APOEL FC players Category:R.E.

Retort is a gathering of antinomians. It is not a typical collective; there is no explicit program. Retort is a motley crew - writers, artists, teachers, artisans, scientists, poets - joined in a web of sustaining friendships, who share an antagonism to the present order of things. Retort has been meeting on a regular basis for the last two decades, for the most part to eat and drink together, but also to discuss politics, history, aesthetics, and the terms and tactics of root-and-branch opposition to capital, empire and the various versions of barbarism currently on offer. There is a deep appreciation of old cafes and city taverns, competing with a tendency to favor the open air - rambles, the back country, tidepool picnics, wild swimming. The gathering has produced broadsides and pamphlets for particular occasions, and from time to time they also organize more public events - readings, conviviums, evenings of film, and so forth. There are collaborations of many kinds within the milieu. The name \\"Retort\\" acknowledges that the project is engaged in a wider conversation whose terms and assumptions they reject, and that Retorters stand on ground, rhetorical and otherwise, not of our own choosing. Some feel forced to spend much of the time - far too much - in rebuttals, demurrers, rejoinders. In a word, retorting. The name gestures to an obscure non- sectarian 1940s journal of that title, which at first, (new) Retort thought seriously about reviving. It was edited and published out of a cabin in Bearsville, a hamlet near Woodstock, New York. Retort's printing press had belonged to the eloquent Wobbly agitator Carlo Tresca, before he was assassinated on the streets of Manhattan, perhaps by agents of Benito Mussolini. The journal Retort was anti-statist, anti-militarist and published essays on art, politics and culture. Poetry too - the first issue published the Kenneth Rexroth poem that begins: : \\"Now in Waldheim where the rain/ Has fallen careless and unthinking/ For all an evil century's youth, / Where now the banks of dark roses lie...\\" Retort Press also published Prison Etiquette: The Convict's Compendium of Useful Information Prison Etiquette: The Convict's Compendium of Useful Information, Amazon.com. compiled by war resisters, specifically those imprisoned for refusing to collaborate either with the state or with the Anabaptist \\"peace churches\\" who had agreed with the US government to self-manage the rural work camps for conscientious objectors. Finally, a retort is like the alchemist's vessel that ferments, distills, transforms. It's fragile, it needs fire, there may be problems with the underlying theory, but there's occasional magic. Retort's broadsheet Neither Their War Nor Their Peace Neither Their War Nor Their Peace, Ludd.net. was produced for distribution at demonstrations against the impending US invasion of Iraq in the spring of 2003. It was later expanded into the book Afflicted Powers: Capital and Spectacle in a New Age of War, written by Iain Boal, T.J. Clark, Joseph Matthews and Michael Watts and published by Verso Books. The broadsheet \\"All Quiet On The Eastern Front\\" \\"All Quiet On The Eastern Front\\", NewLeftREview.org. was part of Retort's installation at the second Seville Biennial. Associated members include English geographer Michael Watts, Irish social historian Iain Boal, British art historian T.J. Clark, radical attorney Joseph Matthews, labor historian Cal Winslow, editor Eddie Yuen, economic geographer Richard Walker, art historian Anne Wagner, Victor Serge translator James Brook, microbial ecologist Ignacio Chapela, poet and writer Summer Brenner, Balkan anarchist Andrej Grubačić, and Italian literary scholar Franco Moretti. == References == ; Sources * Retort, \\"Blood for Oil?\\" London Review of Books, April 21, 2005. * Retort, Afflicted Powers: Capital and Spectacle in a New Age of War Verso, 2nd edition with afterword, 2006.

General Charles-Théodore Millot, the commander-in- chief of the Tonkin Expeditionary Corps, followed up his victory in the Bắc Ninh Campaign by mopping up scattered Chinese garrisons left behind by the Guangxi Army after the rout at Bắc Ninh by mounting a major campaign against Liu Yongfu's Black Flag Army and Prince Hoàng Kế Viêm's Annamese forces, which had retreated to Hưng Hóa after their defeat in the Sơn Tây Campaign (December 1883). In April 1884 Millot advanced on Hưng Hóa with both brigades of the Tonkin Expeditionary Corps. ==French high command, Hưng Hóa campaign== File:Charles-Théodore Millot.jpgGeneral Charles-Théodore Millot (1829–89) Image:Louis Briere de lIsle.jpgGeneral Louis Brière de l'Isle (1827–96) Image:François Oscar de Négrier.jpgGeneral François de Négrier (1842–1913) ==March to Hưng Hóa, 4–10 April 1884== French artillery crosses the Black River during the march to Hưng Hóa, April 1884 The base for the Hưng Hóa campaign was Sơn Tây. General Louis Brière de l'Isle's 1st Brigade set out from Hanoi on 5 April, after parading through the town in an imposing display of strength. General François de Négrier's 2nd Brigade, which was deployed around Bắc Ninh and Phu Liang Giang, set off for Hanoi on 4 April. On 5 April the 2nd Brigade spent the entire day crossing the Red River, and on the next day, it paraded through Hanoi on its way west to Sơn Tây. Marching overland from Hanoi past the battlefields of 1883, the two brigades reached Sơn Tây on 6–7 April, respectively. On 8 April both brigades left Sơn Tây, marching toward the Black River, so as to approach Hưng Hóa from the south and the southeast, respectively. Millot sent Colonel Belin's marine infantry marching regiment on ahead to seize the village of Tai Bắc on the Black River and fortify it as a base for the river crossing and subsequent march on Hưng Hóa. On 10 April, after a day spent scouting ahead, Brière de l'Isle's 1st Brigade reached the Black River. On 11 April, the brigade set off southwards at dawn on a wide outflanking march to threaten Liu Yongfu's line of retreat. The brigade crossed the Black River and marched northwest along the mountain path, approaching Hưng Hóa from the south. Marine artillerymen and Turcos of Brière de l'Isle's 1st Brigade at a halt on the Clear River during the march to Hưng Hóa, April 1884 Meanwhile, de Négrier's 2nd Brigade painfully crossed the Black River at Vu Chu on 10 April. Millot's staff had assembled fifteen junks and two tugs for this operation, but de Négrier had nearly 4,000 men to get across and a large artillery train. Five French soldiers and a dozen coolies, too impatient to wait their turn to cross the river by junk, tried to swim across and were carried away by the strong current and drowned. These were the only French casualties of the Hưng Hóa operation. At 6 a.m. on 11 April the 2nd Brigade left the Black River and marched due west towards Hưng Hóa. At 9 a.m. the brigade's advance guard occupied a position on a wooded height overlooking the Red River above the village of Trung Hà, whose plateau, thickly covered in tall umbrella pines, offered an ideal observation post and firing platform for the French artillery. Hưng Hóa on the southern bank of the Red River, was clearly visible five kilometres to the west. By 10:00, Millot's heavy artillery and the bulk of the 2nd Brigade's infantry were assembled on the Trung Hà plateau. The Black Flags remained inside Hưng Hóa, and made no attempt to dispute the French advance. Millot had hoped that the gunboats of the Tonkin Flotilla could support the attack, but Hache and Yatagan drew too much water to sail beyond the confluence of the Red River and the Clear River. Only Trombe and Éclair reached the junction of the Red and Black Rivers to take part in the upcoming battle. ==Bombardment and capture of Hưng Hóa, 11–12 April 1884== The Black Flags had thrown up an impressive series of fortifications around Hưng Hóa, but Millot made no attempt to attack the town's formidable defences. Having pinned the Black Flags frontally with General de Négrier's 2nd Brigade, he subjected Hưng Hóa to a ferocious artillery bombardment from Trung Hà with two 80-millimetre and one 90-millimetre artillery batteries. The bombardment began at 10 a.m. on 11 April and lasted for several hours, setting many buildings inside Hưng Hóa alight and inflicting heavy casualties on the Black Flag defenders. The French did not suffer a single battle casualty. The soldiers of the 2nd Brigade spent the day in complete idleness, enjoying the warm spring sunshine and watching the smoke rise silently from Hưng Hóa as the French artillery methodically reduced the town to ruins.Challan de Belval, pp. 144–45 While Millot's artillery bombarded Hưng Hóa, General Louis Brière de l'Isle's 1st Brigade successfully executed its flank march to the south of Hưng Hóa. On 11 April, seeing Brière de l'Isle's Turcos and marine infantry emerging behind their flank at Xuân Đồng, the Black Flags evacuated Hưng Hóa before they were trapped inside. They set alight the remaining buildings before they left, and on the following morning the French found the town completely abandoned.Huard, pp. 280–6; Thomazi, Histoire militaire, p. 84 ==Order of the day== On 13 April 1884, Millot issued the following order of the day to mark the capture of Hưng Hóa: > Un mois jour pour jour après la prise de Bac-Ninh, vous entrez dans la > citadelle de Hong-Hoa. C'est une nouvelle et brillante victoire, dont la > République vous remercie. Si j'ai été assez heureux pour épargner votre > sang, vous m’avez en revanche prodigué votre énergie dans les circonstances > fréquentes où j'ai dû y faire appel. Je suis heureux de vous le dire. Si > vous avez agrandi notre possession d'une belle province, vous avez prouvé de > nouveau que la France avait de vigoureux soldats animés du plus pur > patriotisme.Sarrat, p. 129 > TRANSLATION: One month to the day after the capture of Bắc Ninh you have > entered the citadel of Hong-Hoa. This is a new and splendid victory for > which the Republic thanks you. If I have been fortunate enough to have > spared your blood, you have repaid me by giving lavishly of your energy on > the many occasions I have had to call upon it. I am happy to say that you > have not only added a fair province to our possessions but have once again > shown that France has vigorous soldiers animated by the purest kind of > patriotism. ==Aftermath== Given its strategic importance, Millot decided to occupy Hưng Hóa. He appointed Lieutenant-Colonel Jacques Duchesne commandant supérieur of Hưng Hóa, and the town was garrisoned with the 1st and 2nd Legion Battalions (Lieutenant-Colonel Donnier and chef de bataillon Hutin). The Black Flag Army retreated westwards up the Red River to Thanh Quan, while Prince Hoàng Kế Viêm's Vietnamese forces fell back southwards from Dong Yan towards the Annam- Tonkin border, making for the sanctuary of the province of Thành Hóa, where the French had not yet installed any garrisons. Millot dispatched Lieutenant- Colonel Letellier with two Turco battalions and supporting cavalry to harry Liu Yongfu's retreat, and sent General Brière de l'Isle with the rest of the 1st Brigade in pursuit of Prince Hoang.Huard, pp. 286–8 During the last fortnight of April Brière de l'Isle pursued Prince Hoang's forces through the southeast provinces of Tonkin, through towns and villages that had never before seen a French soldier. After entering Đồng Yan and destroying its citadel he faced about and marched down to the Black River, crossed the river at Gran Co, then left the mountains and led his troops down the Day River to Ninh Bình, accepting the submission of small prefectures. Millot sent the gunboats Carabine to Phú Lý, and the Mousqueton to Ninh Bình to further intimidate inhabitants of the southeast provinces as well as to hunt down stragglers from Prince Hoang's army. In early May, Brière de l'Isle cornered Prince Hoang in Phú Ngô, several kilometres northwest of Ninh Bình, but the French government forbade him to attack the Vietnamese defences, having just received news that China was ready to treat with France over the future of Tonkin.Huard, pp. 288–90 Further French successes in the spring of 1884, including the capture of Thái Nguyên, had convinced the Empress Dowager Cixi that China should come to terms, and an accord was reached between France and China in May. The negotiations took place in Tientsin. Li Hongzhang, the leader of the Chinese moderates, represented China; and Captain François- Ernest Fournier, commander of the French cruiser Volta, represented France. The Tientsin Accord, concluded on 11 May 1884, provided for a Chinese troop withdrawal from Tonkin in return for a comprehensive treaty that would settle details of trade and commerce between France and China and provide for the demarcation of its disputed border with Vietnam. It was hoped the Tientsin Accord would resolve the confrontation between France and China in Tonkin, but a clash between French and Chinese troops at Bắc Lè on 23 June 1884 plunged both countries into a fresh crisis. China's refusal to pay an indemnity for the Bắc Lệ ambush led two months later to the outbreak of the Sino-French War (August 1884 – April 1885).Thomazi, Conquête, pp. 193–96 ==ReferencesSources== * Challan de Belval, Au Tonkin 1884–1885: notes, souvenirs et impressions (Paris, 1904) * Huard, La guerre du Tonkin (Paris, 1887) * Lung Chang [龍章], Yueh-nan yu Chung-fa chan-cheng [越南與中法戰爭, Vietnam and the Sino- French War] (Taipei, 1993) * Sarrat, L., Journal d'un marsouin au Tonkin, 1883–1886 (Paris, 1887) * Thomazi, A., Histoire militaire de l'Indochine française (Hanoi, 1931) * Thomazi, A., La conquête de l'Indochine (Paris, 1934) Category:Tonkin campaign Category:Conflicts in 1884 Category:1884 in Vietnam Category:1884 in France Hung Hoa Hung Hoa Category:Phú Thọ Province Category:April 1884 events Category:History of Phú Thọ Province ","title":"Capture of Hưng Hóa"},{"id":"20511099","text":"Lucea may refer to: * Lucea, Jamaica, a coastal town * Lucea East River, a river in Jamaica * Lucea West River, a river in Jamaica * Santa Lucea, a town of the Ais tribe, now St. Lucie Inlet, Florida ","title":"Lucea"},{"id":"20511111","text":"Keith Butler (2 September 1938 – 13 March 2019) was a British cycling champion who raced as a professional in Belgium and France and who later organised cycle races in England. ==Biography== Butler was born in London, England, in 1938. As an amateur, Butler won stages of the Milk Race, the Tour of Britain, in 1961 and 1963. He won the national team pursuit championship with colleagues from the Norwood Paragon club, south London, in 1963. He represented England in the road race at the 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Perth, Australia. In 1962 he took part in Peace-Race and finished at 51. He went to Belgium to race soon afterwards. He won his second race, the first of 11 victories.Cycling Weekly, UK, May 2002 He said: :\\"There'd be so many races that you'd cross one going the other way. And there'd be a lot of catcalling and waving and then you'd get on with the racing. And there'd be no team tactics allowed and there were no service cars or team cars. But what used to happen is that all the riders from, say, Destelbergen, would ride together in a group even though they came from four or five different clubs. But that's as far as it was allowed to go. The only times the roads were closed was in criteriums, and that was because they were on circuits of just two or three kilometres and it wouldn't be safe to have traffic on them. But that also meant you couldn't have many riders either, so they'd be invitation only. They'd get two or three good riders to attract the crowd, then all the local boys they could get and if there were any places left over you could get one as a foreigner. But essentially they were just by invitation\\".Procycling, UK, 2007 He won the professional British National Road Race Championships at Harlow, Essex, in 1964, beating Albert Hitchen and Ged Coles. He finished third in 1965. He returned to Belgium, took a fully professional licence - until then he had been an independent, a semi- professional allowed to ride with both amateurs and professionals - and rode briefly for Jacques Anquetil's St-Raphaël team before leaving shortly afterwards for the Ruberg team in West Germany. Butler earned 5,000 francs a month, he remembers, \\"which doesn't sound much now but remember that 1,000 francs would get you a flat for a month and that on top of your retainer you got your travel expenses and your prizes.\\" He rode the Belgian spring classics and finished 14th in the Tour of Flanders. He rode for Tom Simpson, a fellow Briton, in the 1965 world championship in Spain. There he followed Anquetil as the Frenchman began to chase. Anquetil was one of the fastest riders in the world alone. Butler said: \\"It was like riding behind a bloody motorbike!\\" He also organised cycle races in southern England. He formed the Surrey League, a consortium of organisers, in 1974. It runs 170 races a year. He managed the British road teams at the world championship in Colorado and managed other teams in France, the Netherlands and Ireland. His father, Stan Butler, was a significant time-triallist in Britain in an era when the country had only velodrome racing and dawn competitions on the road against the clock. Stan Butler also rode the Olympic Games. Keith Butler's son, Gethin Butler, was a prominent amateur rider in Britain during the 1990s. ==References== Category:1938 births Category:2019 deaths Category:English male cyclists Category:British cycling road race champions Category:Cyclists from Greater London ","title":"Keith Butler (cyclist)"},{"id":"20511142","text":"Tuya Lake, located in northwestern British Columbia, Canada,Lakes - Canada Retrieved November 13, 2008. presumably derives its name from the presence of nearby steep-sided, flat-topped volcanoes, known as tuyas.Area Data - Tuya Mountains Retrieved November 13, 2008.

Quantum entanglement distillation can in this way overcome the degenerative influence of noisy quantum channels by transforming previously shared less entangled pairs into a smaller number of maximally entangled pairs. ==History== The limits for entanglement dilution and distillation are due to Bennett, Bernstein, Popescu and Schumacher. Entanglement distillation protocols for pure states were originally presented in a paper by C. H. Bennett, H. Bernstein, S. Popescu, and B. Schumacher while Entanglement distillation protocols for mixed states were introduced by Bennett, Brassard, Popescu, Schumacher, Smolin and Wootters. Bennett, DiVincenzo, Smolin and Wootters established the connection to quantum error- correction in a ground-breaking paper published in August 1996 also in the journal of Physical Review, which has stimulated a lot of subsequent research. ==Quantifying entanglement== A two qubit system can be written as a superposition of possible computational basis qubit states: 00\\\\rangle, 01\\\\rangle, 10\\\\rangle, 11\\\\rangle, each with an associated complex coefficient \\\\alpha\\\\,\\\\\\\\!: :\\\\psi\\\\rangle = \\\\alpha_{00}00\\\\rangle + \\\\alpha_{01}01\\\\rangle + \\\\alpha_{10}10\\\\rangle + \\\\alpha_{11}11\\\\rangle As in the case of a single qubit, the probability of measuring a particular computational basis state x\\\\rangle is the square of the modulus of its amplitude, or associated coefficient, \\\\alpha_{x}^{2}\\\\,\\\\\\\\!, subject to the normalization condition \\\\sum_{x \\\\in {0,1}}\\\\alpha_{x}^{2} = 1. The normalization condition guarantees that the sum of the probabilities add up to 1, meaning that upon measurement, one of the states will be observed. The Bell state is a particularly important example of a two qubit state:\\\\frac{00\\\\rangle+11\\\\rangle}{\\\\sqrt{2}} Bell states possess the property that measurement outcomes on the two qubits are correlated. As can be seen from the expression above, the two possible measurement outcomes are zero and one, both with probability of 50%. As a result, a measurement of the second qubit always gives the same result as the measurement of the first qubit. Bell states can be used to quantify entanglement. Let m be the number of high- fidelity copies of a Bell state that can be produced using LOCC. Given a large number of Bell states the amount of entanglement present in a pure state \\\\psi\\\\rangle can then be defined as the ratio of n/m, called the distillable entanglement of a particular state \\\\phi\\\\rangle, which gives a quantified measure of the amount of entanglement present in a given system. The process of entanglement distillation aims to saturate this limiting ratio. The number of copies of a pure state that may be converted into a maximally entangled state is equal to the von Neumann entropy S(p) of the state, which is an extension of the concept of classical entropy for quantum systems. Mathematically, for a given density matrix p, the von Neumann entropy S(p) is S(p) = -\\\\mathrm{Tr}(p \\\\ln p). Entanglement can then be quantified as the entropy of entanglement, which is the von Neumann entropy of either p_{A} or p_{B} as: :E = -\\\\mathrm{Tr}(p_{A} \\\\ln p_{A}) = -\\\\mathrm{Tr}(p_{B} \\\\ln p_{B}), Which ranges from 0 for a product state to \\\\ln 2 for a maximally entangled state (if the \\\\ln is replaced by \\\\log_2 then maximally entangled has a value of 1). ==Motivation== Suppose that two parties, Alice and Bob, would like to communicate classical information over a noisy quantum channel. Either classical or quantum information can be transmitted over a quantum channel by encoding the information in a quantum state. With this knowledge, Alice encodes the classical information that she intends to send to Bob in a (quantum) product state, as a tensor product of reduced density matrices p_{1} \\\\otimes p_{2} \\\\otimes.... where each p\\\\,\\\\\\\\! is diagonal and can only be used as a one time input for a particular channel \\\\epsilon. The fidelity of the noisy quantum channel is a measure of how closely the output of a quantum channel resembles the input, and is therefore a measure of how well a quantum channel preserves information. If a pure state \\\\psi is sent into a quantum channel emerges as the state represented by density matrix p, the fidelity of transmission is defined as F = \\\\langle\\\\psip\\\\psi\\\\rangle. The problem that Alice and Bob now face is that quantum communication over large distances depends upon successful distribution of highly entangled quantum states, and due to unavoidable noise in quantum communication channels, the quality of entangled states generally decreases exponentially with channel length as a function of the fidelity of the channel. Entanglement distillation addresses this problem of maintaining a high degree of entanglement between distributed quantum states by transforming N copies of an arbitrary entangled state \\\\rho into approximately S(\\\\rho)N Bell pairs, using only local operations and classical communication. The objective is to share strongly correlated qubits between distant parties (Alice and Bob) in order to allow reliable quantum teleportation or quantum cryptography. ==Entanglement concentrationPure states=== The new fidelity after one iteration of the distillation protocol for pure states. Given n particles in the singlet state shared between Alice and Bob, local actions and classical communication will suffice to prepare m arbitrarily good copies of \\\\phi with a yield :\\\\frac{m}{n} approaching \\\\frac{1}{E(\\\\phi)} as n \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty. Let an entangled state \\\\psi\\\\rangle have a Schmidt decomposition: :\\\\psi\\\\rangle = \\\\sum_{x}\\\\sqrt{p(x)}x_{A}\\\\ranglex_{B}\\\\rangle where coefficients p(x) form a probability distribution, and thus are positive valued and sum to unity. The tensor product of this state is then, :\\\\psi\\\\rangle ^{\\\\otimes m} = \\\\sum_{x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{m}}\\\\sqrt{p(x_{1})p(x_{2})...p(x_{m})}x_{1A}x_{2A}...x_{mA}\\\\rangle  x_{1B}x_{2B}...x_{mB}\\\\rangle Now, omitting all terms x_{1},...,x_{m}\\\\,\\\\\\\\! which are not part of any sequence which is likely to occur with high probability, known as the typical set : A_{\\\\epsilon}^{(n)} the new state is :\\\\phi_{m}\\\\rangle = \\\\sum_{x \\\\epsilon A_{\\\\epsilon}^{(n)}}\\\\sqrt{p(x_{1})p(x_{2})...p(x_{m})}x_{1A}x_{2A}...x_{mA}\\\\rangle x_{1B}x_{2B}...x_{mB}\\\\rangle And renormalizing, :\\\\phi_{m}^{'}\\\\rangle = \\\\frac{\\\\phi_{m}\\\\rangle}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\langle\\\\phi_{m}\\\\phi_{m}\\\\rangle}} Then the fidelity :F(\\\\psi\\\\rangle ^{\\\\otimes m}, \\\\phi_{m}^{'}\\\\rangle) \\\\rightarrow 1 as m \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty. Suppose that Alice and Bob are in possession of m copies of \\\\psi\\\\rangle. Alice can perform a measurement onto the typical set A_{\\\\epsilon}^{(n)} subset of p_{\\\\psi}\\\\,\\\\\\\\!, converting the state \\\\psi\\\\rangle^{\\\\otimes m} \\\\rightarrow \\\\phi_{m}\\\\rangle with high fidelity. The theorem of typical sequences then shows us that 1-\\\\delta\\\\,\\\\\\\\! is the probability that the given sequence is part of the typical set, and may be made arbitrarily close to 1 for sufficiently large m, and therefore the Schmidt coefficients of the renormalized Bell state \\\\phi_{m}^{'}\\\\rangle will be at most a factor \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\delta}} larger. Alice and Bob can now obtain a smaller set of n Bell states by performing LOCC on the state \\\\phi_{m}^{'}\\\\rangle with which they can overcome the noise of a quantum channel to communicate successfully. ===Mixed states=== The new fidelity after one iteration of the distillation protocol presented here for mixed states Many techniques have been developed for doing entanglement distillation for mixed states, giving a lower bounds on the value of the distillable entanglement D(p) for specific classes of states p. One common method involves Alice not using the noisy channel to transmit source states directly but instead preparing a large number of Bell states, sending half of each Bell pair to Bob. The result from transmission through the noisy channel is to create the mixed entangled state p, so that Alice and Bob end up sharing m copies of p. Alice and Bob then perform entanglement distillation, producing m \\\\cdot D(p) almost perfectly entangled states from the mixed entangled states p by performing local unitary operations and measurements on the shared entangled pairs, coordinating their actions through classical messages, and sacrificing some of the entangled pairs to increase the purity of the remaining ones. Alice can now prepare an m \\\\cdot D(p) qubit state and teleport it to Bob using the m \\\\cdot D(p) Bell pairs which they share with high fidelity. What Alice and Bob have then effectively accomplished is having simulated a noiseless quantum channel using a noisy one, with the aid of local actions and classical communication. Let M be a general mixed state of two spin-1/2 particles which could have resulted from the transmission of an initially pure singlet state :\\\\psi^{-} = (\\\\uparrow\\\\downarrow-\\\\downarrow\\\\uparrow)/\\\\sqrt{2} through a noisy channel between Alice and Bob, which will be used to distill some pure entanglement. The fidelity of M :F = \\\\langle\\\\psi^{-}M\\\\psi^{-}\\\\rangle is a convenient expression of its purity relative to a perfect singlet. Suppose that M is already a pure state of two particles M = \\\\phi\\\\rangle\\\\langle\\\\phi for some \\\\phi. The entanglement for \\\\phi, as already established, is the von Neumann entropy E(\\\\phi) = S(p_{A}) = S(p_{B}) where :p_{A} = \\\\operatorname{tr}^{}_{B}(\\\\phi\\\\rangle\\\\langle\\\\phi), and likewise for p_{B}, represent the reduced density matrices for either particle. The following protocol is then used: #Performing a random bilateral rotation on each shared pair, choosing a random SU(2) rotation independently for each pair and applying it locally to both members of the pair transforms the initial general two-spin mixed state M into a rotationally symmetric mixture of the singlet state \\\\phi^{-} and the three triplet states \\\\phi^{+} and \\\\psi^{\\\\frac{+}{-}}: W_{F} = F \\\\cdot \\\\psi^{-}\\\\rangle\\\\langle\\\\psi^{-} + \\\\frac{1-F}{3}\\\\phi^{+}\\\\rangle\\\\langle\\\\phi^{+} + \\\\frac{1-F}{3}\\\\psi^{+}\\\\rangle\\\\langle\\\\psi^{+} + \\\\frac{1-F}{3}\\\\phi^{-}\\\\rangle\\\\langle\\\\phi^{-} The Werner state W_{F} has the same purity F as the initial mixed state M from which it was derived due to the singlet's invariance under bilateral rotations. #Each of the two pairs is then acted on by a unilateral rotation, which we can call \\\\sigma_{y}, which has the effect of converting them from mainly \\\\phi^{-} Werner states to mainly \\\\psi^{+} states with a large component F > \\\\frac{1}{2} of \\\\psi^{+} while the components of the other three Bell states are equal. #The two impure \\\\psi^{+} states are then acted on by a bilateral XOR, and afterwards the target pair is locally measured along the z axis. The unmeasured source pair is kept if the target pair's spins come out parallel as in the case of both inputs being true \\\\psi^{+} states; and it is discarded otherwise. #If the source pair has not been discarded it is converted back to a predominantly \\\\phi^{-} state by a unilateral \\\\sigma_{y} rotation, and made rotationally symmetric by a random bilateral rotation. Repeating the outlined protocol above will distill Werner states whose purity may be chosen to be arbitrarily high F_{out} < 1 from a collection M of input mixed states of purity F_{in} > \\\\frac{1}{2} but with a yield tending to zero in the limit F_{out} \\\\rightarrow 1. By performing another bilateral XOR operation, this time on a variable number k(F) \\\\approx \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{1-F}} of source pairs, as opposed to 1, into each target pair prior to measuring it, the yield can be made to approach a positive limit as F_{out} \\\\rightarrow 1. This method can then be combined with others to obtain an even higher yield. ==Procrustean method== The Procrustean method of entanglement concentration can be used for as little as one partly entangled pair, being more efficient than the Schmidt projection method for entangling less than 5 pairs, and requires Alice and Bob to know the bias (\\\\theta) of the n pairs in advance. The method derives its name from Procrustes because it produces a perfectly entangled state by chopping off the extra probability associated with the larger term in the partial entanglement of the pure states: \\\\cos\\\\theta \\\\left\\\\uparrow_{A}\\\\right\\\\rangle \\\\otimes \\\\left\\\\downarrow_{B}\\\\right\\\\rangle - \\\\sin\\\\theta \\\\left\\\\downarrow_{A}\\\\right\\\\rangle \\\\otimes \\\\left\\\\uparrow_{B}\\\\right\\\\rangle Assuming a collection of particles for which \\\\theta is known as being either less than or greater than \\\\pi/4 the Procrustean method may be carried out by keeping all particles which, when passed through a polarization-dependent absorber, or a polarization-dependent- reflector, which absorb or reflect a fraction tan^{2}\\\\theta of the more likely outcome, are not absorbed or deflected. Therefore, if Alice possesses particles for which \\\\theta eq \\\\pi/4, she can separate out particles which are more likely to be measured in the up/down basis, and left with particles in maximally mixed state of spin up and spin down. This treatment corresponds to a POVM (positive-operator-valued measurement). To obtain a perfectly entangled state of two particles, Alice informs Bob of the result of her generalized measurement while Bob doesn't measure his particle at all but instead discards his if Alice discards hers. ==Stabilizer protocol== The purpose of an \\\\left[ n,k\\\\right] entanglement distillation protocol is to distill k pure ebits from n noisy ebits where 0\\\\leq k\\\\leq n. The yield of such a protocol is k/n. Two parties can then use the noiseless ebits for quantum communication protocols. The two parties establish a set of shared noisy ebits in the following way. The sender Alice first prepares n Bell states \\\\left\\\\vert \\\\Phi ^{+}\\\\right\\\\rangle ^{\\\\otimes n} locally. She sends the second qubit of each pair over a noisy quantum channel to a receiver Bob. Let \\\\left\\\\vert \\\\Phi _{n}^{+}\\\\right\\\\rangle be the state \\\\left\\\\vert \\\\Phi^{+}\\\\right\\\\rangle ^{\\\\otimes n} rearranged so that all of Alice's qubits are on the left and all of Bob's qubits are on the right. The noisy quantum channel applies a Pauli error in the error set \\\\mathcal{E}\\\\subset\\\\Pi^{n} to the set of n qubits sent over the channel. The sender and receiver then share a set of n noisy ebits of the form \\\\left( \\\\mathbf{I}\\\\otimes\\\\mathbf{A}\\\\right) \\\\left\\\\vert \\\\Phi_{n} ^{+}\\\\right\\\\rangle where the identity \\\\mathbf{I} acts on Alice's qubits and \\\\mathbf{A} is some Pauli operator in \\\\mathcal{E} acting on Bob's qubits. A one-way stabilizer entanglement distillation protocol uses a stabilizer code for the distillation procedure. Suppose the stabilizer \\\\mathcal{S} for an \\\\left[ n,k\\\\right] quantum error-correcting code has generators g_{1},\\\\ldots,g_{n-k}. The distillation procedure begins with Alice measuring the n-k generators in \\\\mathcal{S}. Let \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\mathbf{P}_{i}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} be the set of the 2^{n-k} projectors that project onto the 2^{n-k} orthogonal subspaces corresponding to the generators in \\\\mathcal{S}. The measurement projects \\\\left\\\\vert \\\\Phi_{n}^{+}\\\\right\\\\rangle randomly onto one of the i subspaces. Each \\\\mathbf{P}_{i} commutes with the noisy operator \\\\mathbf{A} on Bob's side so that : \\\\left( \\\\mathbf{P}_{i}\\\\otimes\\\\mathbf{I}\\\\right) \\\\left( \\\\mathbf{I} \\\\otimes\\\\mathbf{A}\\\\right) \\\\left\\\\vert \\\\Phi_{n}^{+}\\\\right\\\\rangle =\\\\left( \\\\mathbf{I}\\\\otimes\\\\mathbf{A}\\\\right) \\\\left( \\\\mathbf{P}_{i}\\\\otimes \\\\mathbf{I}\\\\right) \\\\left\\\\vert \\\\Phi_{n}^{+}\\\\right\\\\rangle . The following important Bell-state matrix identity holds for an arbitrary matrix \\\\mathbf{M}: : \\\\left( \\\\mathbf{M}\\\\otimes\\\\mathbf{I}\\\\right) \\\\left\\\\vert \\\\Phi_{n}^{+} \\\\right\\\\rangle =\\\\left( \\\\mathbf{I}\\\\otimes\\\\mathbf{M}^{T}\\\\right) \\\\left\\\\vert \\\\Phi_{n}^{+}\\\\right\\\\rangle . Then the above expression is equal to the following: : \\\\left( \\\\mathbf{I}\\\\otimes\\\\mathbf{A}\\\\right) \\\\left( \\\\mathbf{P}_{i} \\\\otimes\\\\mathbf{I}\\\\right) \\\\left\\\\vert \\\\Phi_{n}^{+}\\\\right\\\\rangle =\\\\left( \\\\mathbf{I}\\\\otimes\\\\mathbf{A}\\\\right) \\\\left( \\\\mathbf{P}_{i}^{2}\\\\otimes \\\\mathbf{I}\\\\right) \\\\left\\\\vert \\\\Phi_{n}^{+}\\\\right\\\\rangle =\\\\left( \\\\mathbf{I}\\\\otimes\\\\mathbf{A}\\\\right) \\\\left( \\\\mathbf{P}_{i} \\\\otimes\\\\mathbf{P}_{i}^{T}\\\\right) \\\\left\\\\vert \\\\Phi_{n}^{+}\\\\right\\\\rangle . Therefore, each of Alice's projectors \\\\mathbf{P}_{i} projects Bob's qubits onto a subspace \\\\mathbf{P}_{i}^{T} corresponding to Alice's projected subspace \\\\mathbf{P}_{i}. Alice restores her qubits to the simultaneous +1-eigenspace of the generators in \\\\mathcal{S}. She sends her measurement results to Bob. Bob measures the generators in \\\\mathcal{S}. Bob combines his measurements with Alice's to determine a syndrome for the error. He performs a recovery operation on his qubits to reverse the error. He restores his qubits \\\\mathcal{S}. Alice and Bob both perform the decoding unitary corresponding to stabilizer \\\\mathcal{S} to convert their k logical ebits to k physical ebits. == Entanglement-assisted stabilizer code == Luo and Devetak provided a straightforward extension of the above protocol (Luo and Devetak 2007). Their method converts an entanglement-assisted stabilizer code into an entanglement- assisted entanglement distillation protocol. Luo and Devetak form an entanglement distillation protocol that has entanglement assistance from a few noiseless ebits. The crucial assumption for an entanglement-assisted entanglement distillation protocol is that Alice and Bob possess c noiseless ebits in addition to their n noisy ebits. The total state of the noisy and noiseless ebits is : (\\\\mathbf{I}^{A}\\\\otimes\\\\left( \\\\mathbf{A\\\\otimes I}\\\\right) ^{B})\\\\left\\\\vert \\\\Phi_{n+c}^{+}\\\\right\\\\rangle where \\\\mathbf{I}^{A} is the 2^{n+c}\\\\times2^{n+c} identity matrix acting on Alice's qubits and the noisy Pauli operator \\\\left( \\\\mathbf{A\\\\otimes I}\\\\right) ^{B} affects Bob's first n qubits only. Thus the last c ebits are noiseless, and Alice and Bob have to correct for errors on the first n ebits only. The protocol proceeds exactly as outlined in the previous section. The only difference is that Alice and Bob measure the generators in an entanglement-assisted stabilizer code. Each generator spans over n+c qubits where the last c qubits are noiseless. We comment on the yield of this entanglement-assisted entanglement distillation protocol. An entanglement-assisted code has n-k generators that each have n+c Pauli entries. These parameters imply that the entanglement distillation protocol produces k+c ebits. But the protocol consumes c initial noiseless ebits as a catalyst for distillation. Therefore, the yield of this protocol is k/n. ==Entanglement dilution== The reverse process of entanglement distillation is entanglement dilution, where large copies of the Bell state are converted into less entangled states using LOCC with high fidelity. The aim of the entanglement dilution process, then, is to saturate the inverse ratio of n to m, defined as the distillable entanglement. ==Applications== Besides its important application in quantum communication, entanglement purification also plays a crucial role in error correction for quantum computation, because it can significantly increase the quality of logic operations between different qubits. The role of entanglement distillation is discussed briefly for the following applications. ===Quantum error correction=== Entanglement distillation protocols for mixed states can be used as a type of error-correction for quantum communications channels between two parties Alice and Bob, enabling Alice to reliably send mD(p) qubits of information to Bob, where D(p) is the distillable entanglement of p, the state that results when one half of a Bell pair is sent through the noisy channel \\\\epsilon connecting Alice and Bob. In some cases, entanglement distillation may work when conventional quantum error-correction techniques fail. Entanglement distillation protocols are known which can produce a non-zero rate of transmission D(p) for channels which do not allow the transmission of quantum information due to the property that entanglement distillation protocols allow classical communication between parties as opposed to conventional error-correction which prohibits it. ===Quantum cryptography=== The concept of correlated measurement outcomes and entanglement is central to quantum key exchange, and therefore the ability to successfully perform entanglement distillation to obtain maximally entangled states is essential for quantum cryptography. If an entangled pair of particles is shared between two parties, anyone intercepting either particle will alter the overall system, allowing their presence (and the amount of information they have gained) to be determined so long as the particles are in a maximally entangled state. Also, in order to share a secret key string, Alice and Bob must perform the techniques of privacy amplification and information reconciliation to distill a shared secret key string. Information reconciliation is error- correction over a public channel which reconciles errors between the correlated random classical bit strings shared by Alice and Bob while limiting the knowledge that a possible eavesdropper Eve can have about the shared keys. After information reconciliation is used to reconcile possible errors between the shared keys that Alice and Bob possess and limit the possible information Eve could have gained, the technique of privacy amplification is used to distill a smaller subset of bits maximizing Eve's uncertainty about the key. ===Quantum teleportation=== In quantum teleportation, a sender wishes to transmit an arbitrary quantum state of a particle to a possibly distant receiver. Quantum teleportation is able to achieve faithful transmission of quantum information by substituting classical communication and prior entanglement for a direct quantum channel. Using teleportation, an arbitrary unknown qubit can be faithfully transmitted via a pair of maximally-entangled qubits shared between sender and receiver, and a 2-bit classical message from the sender to the receiver. Quantum teleportation requires a noiseless quantum channel for sharing perfectly entangled particles, and therefore entanglement distillation satisfies this requirement by providing the noiseless quantum channel and maximally entangled qubits. ==See also== *Quantum channel *Quantum cryptography *Quantum entanglement *Quantum state *Quantum teleportation *LOCC ==Notes and references== * . * . * . * . * * * . * * Mark M.

Step sequences in pair skating should be performed \\"together or close together\\".S&P;/ID 2018, p. 114 Step sequences must be a part of the short program, but they are not required in the free skating program. The step sequence must be \\"visible and identifiable\\",Tech Panel, p. 3 in any shape they like (oval, circle, straight line, or serpentine). The ISU defines a step sequence in ice dance as \\"a series of prescribed or un-prescribed steps, turns and movements in a Rhythm Dance or a Free Dance\\".S&P;/ID, p. 121 Step sequences in ice dance have three divisions: types, groups, and styles. == Background == A step sequence is a required element in all four disciplines of figure skating, men's single skating, women's single skating, pair skating, and ice dance. Step sequences have been defined as \\"steps and turns in a pattern on the ice\\". The ISU requires that all step sequences are performed \\"according to the character of the music\\".S&P;/ID 2018, pp. 103–104 A step sequence must have the following characteristics to earn the most points: the sequence must match the music; it must be performed effortlessly throughout the sequence, and have good energy, flow, and execution; and it must have deep edges and clean turns and steps.ISU No. 2168, p. 13 Also important but not required are the following characteristics: a sequence must have originality and creativity; the skater must have \\"excellent commitment and control\\" of his or her entire body; and the skater must have good acceleration and deceleration during the sequence. Skaters earn the most points in step sequences by performing steps and movements with \\"flair and personality\\", by turning in both directions, by using one foot and then the other, and by including up and down movements. Skaters can make short stops during a step sequence, but they must be performed in accordance with the music. Skaters must also perform steps and turns that are balanced throughout the sequence. It is required that both junior and senior single skaters include a maximum of one step sequence in their free skating programs.S&P;/ID 2018, p. 109 Skaters can choose any kind of step sequence they wish, and can include any unlisted jump, but they must fully use the ice surface. If a step sequence is barely visible or too short, it does not fulfill step sequence requirements.S&P;/ID 2018, p. 108S&P;/ID 2018, p. 111 == Pair skating == Chinese pair skaters Pang Qing and Tong Jian (2011), performing a twizzle Step sequences in pair skating should be performed \\"together or close together\\". Step sequences must be a part of the short program, but they are not required in the free skating program. There is no required pattern, but pair teams must fully use the ice surface. The step sequence must be \\"visible and identifiable\\", in any shape they like (oval, circle, straight line, or serpentine). Step sequences can include any unlisted jump, regardless of the number of revolutions, and short stops, if they are done \\"in accordance with the music\\", are allowed. All turns and steps must be performed on one foot, and they should have variety, which the ISU defines as at least nine difficult turns and steps executed by both partners. The ISU also considers simple variety in step sequences at least seven difficult turns and steps, and a minimum variety of at least five difficult turns and steps. The types of turns and steps can only be counted once per sequence. The team must skate three meters or less near each other while executing the crossing feature of the sequence.Tech Panel, pp. 3, 4 They must not separate, with no breaks, for at least half of the sequence. Changes of holds, which can include \\"a brief moment\\" when the partners do not touch, are permitted during the step sequence.Tech Panel, p. 5 The workload between the partners must be even to help them earn more points. More points are rewarded to teams when they change places or holds, or when they perform difficult skating moves together. Teams also earn more points for the following: if they use difficult skating moves together and change holds and places during step sequences; if they execute rotations to either the right or the left, \\"with full body rotation covering at least one-third of the pattern in total for each rotational direction\\"; if they use their body movements for at least one-third of the pattern; changes in position (defined as \\"crossing at least three times while doing steps and turns\\") for at least a third of the sequence but not over half of it; and if the partners execute two different combinations of three difficult turns. Both partners must execute the combinations of difficult turns at the same time and with a clear rhythm and continuous flow, but without the free foot touching the ice, although they do not have to execute the same kind of turns. Partners can perform rockers, counters, brackets, loops, and twizzles during combinations of difficult turns. Three turns, changes of edges, jumps and/or hops, and changes of feet are not allowed, and \\"at least one turn in the combination must be of a different type than the others\\" Two combinations of difficult turns are the same if they consist of the same turns performed in the same order, on the same foot and on the same edges. Rotations to either the right or the left can be accomplished with any listed and unlisted steps and turns, as long as they are done continuously in one direction for at least 1/3 of the sequence and \\"then continuously for at least 1/3 of the sequence in the opposite direction (clockwise and anti-clockwise)\\". Rotations can also be performed throughout the length of the sequence the skaters are rotating with any unlisted and listed steps and turns they choose, for at least a third of the total sequence and at least a third of the total sequence in the opposite direction (also clockwise and anti-clockwise). Use of body movements is defined as the visible use by both partners any movements of the arms, and/or hips and/or legs and/or head and/or torso. These movements must affect the balance of the main body core, which affect the balance of the entire body and influence the balance on their blades. ===Gallery of turns used in step sequences=== File:Rocker turn.gifRocker turn File:Counter.GIFCounter turn File:Bracket.GIFBracket turn == Ice dance == Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir (2009) demonstrating an ice dance hold The ISU defines a step sequence in ice dance as \\"a series of prescribed or un-prescribed steps, turns and movements in a Rhythm Dance or a Free Dance\\". Step sequences have three divisions: types, groups, and styles. There are two types of step sequences: not-touching or in hold. Not-touching step sequences must include matching and/or mirror footwork; both ice dancers must skate as close to each other as possible, not more than two arm lengths apart, without touching, except when they are skating turns and edges in opposite directions for short distances. The dancers can switch from mirror to matching footwork, and vice versa, and they can cross each other's tracings (marks made in the ice by the skates). Step sequences in hold must be performed in any dance holds or any variation of dance holds, and must not last over one measure of music. Types of step sequences are separated into four Groups, based upon their difficulty. Group A includes straight line step sequences: the midline, which is performed along the ice surface's full length, on its long axis; and the diagonal, which is performed from corner to corner, as fully as possible. Group B includes three curved step sequences. The circular, which is performed on the rink's entire width, on its short axis, can skated either clockwise or counterclockwise. The serpentine, which must be performed along the full length of the rink, can be done in either a clockwise or counterclockwise direction at the rink's long axis, at one end, and then progresses in either two or three S-shaped bold curves, ending up at the other end of the rink. Group C consists of partial step sequences: the pattern dance type sequence, which can be done anywhere on the ice and follows the chosen pattern dance; and the one foot step sequence, which is skated on one foot by each partner, separately, in hold, or at the same time. Group D consists of a combination step sequence, an element in which skaters must perform one-foot turns simultaneously but not touch each other, plus any step sequence in Groups A or B. Both juniors and seniors must include the combination step sequence in their free dances, but can choose any steps they like, as long as they are done simultaneously. The ISU describes and announces any variation of combination of Groups or the creation of other groups in an ISU Communication.S&P;/ID, pp. 121-122 The ISU states the following about styles of step sequences: \\"Characteristics of Levels of step sequences, organized as styles, are technical requirements with ongoing validity and are published in an ISU Communication\\".S&P;/ID, p. 122 == Footnotes References Works cited == * \\"Special Regulations & Technical Rules Single & Pair Skating and Ice Dance 2018\\".

The ruling meant that Bolivia, Ecuador, and Colombia would be prevented from hosting FIFA World Cup qualifiers in their own capital cities. The ban was revoked in May 2008. == Origins == The ruling followed complaints by the Brazilian Football Confederation that La Paz and other Andean venues left visiting players gasping for breath and with pounding hearts. Brazilian club Flamengo had vowed to boycott high-altitude games after several of its players resorted to using bottled oxygen during a Copa Libertadores fixture against Real Potosí of Bolivia, held in rainy conditions at an altitude of .Bolivia lead fight against FIFA ban on high altitude in The Scotsman Following this complaint a number of other Brazilian clubs declared that they would not play Copa Libertadores games at high altitude and put pressure on the Brazilian Football Confederation and FIFA to impose a ban on football at high altitude. == The ruling == The ruling required players to arrive at the host city one week before international games above and two weeks for matches higher than , to allow time to adjust to the thin air. == Reaction == Many of Bolivia's major cities, including Sucre and Potosí, are at high altitude. Bolivia's president, Evo Morales, vowed to lead a campaign against the ban after speaking at an emergency cabinet meeting. Morales said the ruling amounted to discrimination: \\"This is not only a ban on Bolivia, but it is also a ban on the universality of sports.\\" Morales described the ban as \\"football apartheid,\\" said he would send a high-level delegation to FIFA's headquarters in Zurich, and called on other countries to join his campaign. \\"We cannot allow discrimination in football, we cannot allow... exclusion in the world of sports,\\" he added. Diego Maradona joined the campaign, playing an hour-long game at Hernando Siles stadium in La Paz, which is located above sea level, to show that if a 47-year-old could play there, so could fit, young professionals. He led a team of former Argentine internationals in a 7–4 victory over a Bolivian team led by Evo Morales. On 1 April 2009, FIFA called Bolivia's 6–1 victory over the Maradona-coached Argentina national team a \\"stunning defeat in high altitude against the rank outsiders\\". Maradona did not blame the altitude for Argentina's defeat, giving credit to the Bolivian players \\"from the goalkeeper to the last substitute\\".https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/newsid=1044558.html#maradona+theres+nothing All of the football associations in South America except Brazil stated that they would ignore the ban on high-altitude football and play fixtures in the stadium of their host's choice, whether or not they had the opportunity to acclimatise for a week. == Raising of the limit == In June 2007 FIFA raised the limit from to , meaning that the only capital city affected by the ban would be La Paz. == Suspension of the ban == In May 2008, FIFA suspended the ban after a letter of protest from CONMEBOL, the governing body of South American football, backed by all member associations except for the Brazilian Football Confederation.Nine countries commit to play at high altitude at CONMEBOLFIFA Relaxes Stance On Altitude Ruling at FIFPro FIFA's executive committee voted to rescind the ruling, thus allowing Bolivia and Ecuador to host World Cup qualifying games in their capital cities.

He is the first governor of the state, which was created by President Salva Kiir on 2 October 2015. ==Career== He was a high- ranking South Sudanese diplomat of the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) who was appointed as Commissioner for National Relief and Rehabilitation Commission in the National Government of South Sudan on 7 June 2012 by President Salva Kiir. He served in this position until 27 November 2013 when differences arose between him and the newly appointed Minister of Gender, Child and Social Welfare, Awut Deng Achuil who was also entrusted to head the defunct Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs and Disaster Management. The Commission which Peter headed is responsible for delivery of humanitarian and relief services to the people of South Sudan while the function of the Ministry for Humanitarian Affairs was for policy formulation and development. When Awut became Minister, she frustrated the work of the commission as she wanted to takeover the functions of the Commission and that didn't sit well with Peter. As a result, he wrote to the President of Republic demanding that the Minister be asked to function within the confines of the constitutional mandate or he be relieved so that the Commission does not die in his hands. Instead of correcting the situation, the President relieved him on 27 November 2013. Since his relief from office, the commission is no longer functioning as its work is usurped by the Minister and the Ministry. The new chairperson will either have to remain dormant or he will also lose his job if he challenges Awut because President Kiir is known for abandoning government interest in order to protect the interest of Awut. Before the outbreak of South Sudan crisis on 15 December 2013, Peter warned the people of South Sudan that the Vice President was provoking a crisis in the country in a meeting they held with President Kiir on 1 May 2013 which he reiterated on national SSTV. He and a group of other Jikany leaders met with former Vice President Riek Machar on 4 May 2013 in which they warned him not to involve and politicize the community of Nuer and SPLA Nuer elements in an SPLM power struggle. On 6 May 2013, Peter and Riek Machar met in his office in which Riek wanted to find out from him what he talked about on National SSTV on 1 May 2013. In front of his aides, Peter explained to Riek that he was taking the country to brink of war by invoking ethnic Nuer sentiments to support his bid for chairmanship of the party rather than using SPLM political flatform to convince voters to elect him. Peter was the first official to call on South Sudanese leaders to stop the crisis before it happened, but instead, he was criticized by Dr. Riek's supports like Hon. Gatluak Riek Jaak and Hon. John Chuol Char saying that Peter was not being truthful and that Dr. Machar was not provoking any crisis in the country. He was also criticized by Nuer Diaspora elements who are staunch supporters of Dr. Riek Machar. But, Peter was vindicated on 15 December 2013 when war brokeout and members of the Nuer community became victims of the crisis because they are from Riek's ethnic group. Peter remained loyal to SPLM under the leadership of President Salva Kiir Mayardit as a symbol of unity and national integration. Peter Lam served as State Minister of Information and Communications in Upper Nile State from June 2010-May 2012. He was also appointed as SPLM Deputy Secretary for External Relations on August 28, 2009. He was previously posted to Canada from May 2006- November 2008 as the first official Representative of the SPLM to Canada. He was also acting as the Chief Representative for the newly formed Government of Southern Sudan. He was charged by the SPLM leadership to organize SPLM Chapters in various cities of Canada and to rally the support of the Government of Canada for SPLM and Government of Southern Sudan. Under extremely difficult conditions, he helped form 14 SPLM Chapters across the country with membership of over 4000. He managed to diplomatically seduce Canada to accept SPLM and work with the Government of Southern Sudan, which finally culminated in the establishment of the Liaison Office for the Government of Southern Sudan in Ottawa in 2008 in accordance with the provisions of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement(CPA) and the Interim Constitution of Southern Sudan. Canada is known internationally for refusing to work with rebels, a case signaled by their refusal to work with the former leader of SPLM Dr. John Garang de Mabior. But those who know Peter Lam Both know that he is a highly persuasive, calm and skillful diplomat whose approach can hardly be rejected. Those qualities helped him succeed with Canada. Peter was one of the key leaders of Sudanese community in Canada who defeated Talisman Energy of Canada. In fact, in 2004, Peter was said to have shut up an extremely arrogant Dr. Jim Buckee, the former CEO of Talisman Energy, who always insisted that Bentiu never had people since independence of Sudan, a point which Peter always took personally being a Nuer himself and knows that Bentiu has the largest Nuer population in Sudan. Peter, a lecturer of Social Work at the University of Calgary, University of Lethbridge and Mount Royal College in Canada, joined SPLM in 1986 after he fled from Sudan at the age of 14 due to civil war. He lived in various refugee camps in Ethiopia, but managed to continue his education with the help of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees(UNHCR). He graduated with B.A. in Political Science and International Relations (1996) in Addis Ababa University in Ethiopia (the oldest university in the continent). He also graduated with Bachelor of Social Work (2002) and Masters of International Social Work (2004) from the University of Calgary. He is in his final stages of his Ph.D. dissertation in the Faculty of Social Work, University of Calgary. In addition to his diplomatic work as SPLM/GOSS Representative to Canada, Peter has extensive diplomatic experience in his work with United Nations in Ethiopia (1996), India (2003) and Jordan in 2005. He has worked with various organizations in Canada including Calgary Catholic Immigration Society as Settlement Officer (1998–2000) and with the City of Calgary as Community Development Officer (2002–2005) and as a Social Planner with the City of Calgary (2005–present). He led the first ever SPLM delegation from Canada in May 2008 to participate in the Second SPLM National Convention in Juba where he played a key role in mobilizing the delegates to maintain the unity of SPLM by proposing to keep the current leadership as it is. The SPLM unity was at stake in the Convention, but the party rose to the challenge and opted to keep the status quo. He submitted his resignation to the chairman of the SPLM on November 15, 2008 stating that he was time pressed with his studies. But those who monitored the situation in Canada said that Peter was humiliated when the Liaison Office for the Government of Southern Sudan was appointed and left him and key SPLM leaders in Canada out of the office. He did not know how to explain this action to the SPLM leaders in Canada who thought he had a role in the appointments. At the same time, he could not point fingers at the leaders in Juba who actually did the appointments due to the political sensitivity of the issue. The appointments made were seen by all southern Sudanese in Canada as tribally motivated, but what is puzzling is that Peter is known to detest tribalism and could not possibly be linked to those appointments. Resignation was an easy route for him to avoid being associated with those appointments. But Peter always denied those claims, saying that he has completed the work he was asked to do. He always says, \\"I have accomplished what was hard to do; what has remained now is the day today management of the chapters and the nurturing of our bilateral diplomatic relations with Canada, which does not require rocket science.\\" His publications include: South Sudan: forgotten tragedy (2003), International Relations of Ethiopia (2004) and upcoming memoires entitled Difficult Journey to be published by the University of Calgary Press. He has also published peer-reviewed articles with Journal of Social Work and Journal of Educational Action Research in 2008. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Second SPLM National Convention, Juba, South Sudan, 2008. *South Sudan: forgotten tragedy (2003).

He went to the Würzburg Conservatory where he studied composition under Hermann Zilcher; and to the Munich Academy of Music, where he studied composition with Joseph Haas and Waltershausen, organ with Gatscher, and conducting with Siegfried von Hausegger. After taking his composition and organ examinations in 1929, he became a master-class student of Haas. He taught at the Munich Academy (1933–37), from 1937 in Frankfurt at the Hoch Conservatory and Hochschule für Musik (1938–46), and the Munich Conservatory (Hochschule für Musik) (1949–72; taking over the composition class of his teacher Joseph Haas). In 1942 Höller joined the NSDAP.Ernst Klee: Das Kulturlexikon zum Dritten Reich. Wer war was vor und nach 1945. S. Fischer, Frankfurt am Main 2007, p. 255. He was also president of the Munich Hochschule für Musik from 1954 to 1972. Höller became a member of the Academy of Arts, Berlin in 1952, and an honorary member of the Bavarian Academy of Fine Arts in 1958. His compositions are characterized by polyphony and colourful, impressionistic harmony and orchestration. They are redolent of Paul Hindemith, Hans Pfitzner, Max Reger and the French 20th century school. He wrote in a tonal idiom regardless of the prevailing fashions, which meant that he was initially criticised as modernist, and later as a reactionary. His music has been recorded by such artists as Eugen Jochum (Symphonic Fantasy and Sweelinck Variations), Wilhelm Furtwängler (Cello Concerto No. 2, with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra) and others. Karl Höller died on 14 April 1987 in Hausham, Miesbach, Bavaria. ==WorksOrchestral=== * Concertino for violin, viola, piano and chamber orchestra, Op. 9 (1930) * Chamber concerto for violin and orchestra, Op. 10 (1930; revised as Violin Concerto, Op. 23, 1938; new version 1967) * Divertimento for Chamber Orchestra, Op. 11a (1939) * Concerto for Organ and Chamber Orchestra, Op. 15 (1930/32; revised 1966) * Toccata, Improvisations and Fugue (orchestration of Op. 16 for 2 pianos) (1942) * Hymn on Gregorian Chorales, Op. 18 (1932/34) * Chamber Concerto for Harpsichord and Small Orchestra or 6 solo instruments (Op. 19, 1933/34; revised 1958) * Symphonic Variations (or Symphonic Fantasy) on a Theme of Girolamo Frescobaldi, Op. 20 (1935, rev. 1956, 1965) * Passacaglia and Fugue on a Theme of Frescobaldi, Op. 25 (1938/39) * 2 cello concertos (No. 1, Op. 26, 1940/41; No. 2, Op. 50, 1949) * Heroische Musik, Op. 28 (1940) * 2 little symphonies, Opp. 32a (1965), 32b (1969) * Concerto grosso for 2 violins and orchestra, Op. 38a (1965; a re- working of the Trio Sonata for 2 violins and piano, Op. 38) * 2 symphonies (No. 1, Op. 40, 1942–46; No. 2, Op. 65, 1973, \\"Homage to Mozart\\") * Sonata for orchestra, Op. 44a (1966) * Serenade for chamber orchestra, Op. 46a (1957; rev. for large orchestra 1972) * Symphonic Concerto for violin and orchestra, Op. 47 (1947/48) * Fugue for string orchestra (1948; a reworking of the first movement of the String Quartet No. 5, Op. 48) * Divertimento for flute and strings, Op. 53a (? 1978) * Sweelinck Variations (\\"Mein junges Lebe hat ein End\\"), Op. 56 (1950/51) * Intrade, Allegro and Fugue, for timpani, percussion and strings, Op. 60 (1962) *”Bamberger” Piano Concerto, Op. 63 (1972/73) * Transcription for orchestra of Franz Schubert's Five German Dances for piano * Transcription for orchestra of Max Reger’s \\"Praeludium und Fughetta\\", Op. 80 (1974) ===Chamber=== * 8 violin sonatas (unnumbered, Op. 4, 1929, revised 1968; No. 1, Op. 30, 1942; No. 2 in G minor, Op. 33, 1943 – dedicated to the memory of Alma Moodie, who died in March 1943; No. 3, Op. 35 \\"Fränkische\\", 1944; No. 4, Op. 37, 1945; No. 5, Op. 39 \\"Honegger Sonata\\", 1946; No. 6, Op. 44, 1947; No. 7, Op. 52, 1949) * Chamber Trio for 2 violins and piano, Op. 6 (1930) * Piano Quartet (Op. 7, 1930; revised 1955) * Divertimento for flute, violin, viola, cello and piano, Op. 11 (1931) * 6 string quartets (No, 1, Op. 24, 1938, revised 1966; No. 2, Op. 36, 1945; No. 3, Op. 42, 1947 – see also Serenade for Wind Quintet, Op. 42a; No. 4 in C, Op. 43, 1947; No. 5, Op. 48, 1948; 1st movt.

In addition to its opioid activity, the drug is a sigma receptor agonist, and has been used widely in scientific research in studies of this receptor. Alazocine is described as a potent analgesic, psychotomimetic or hallucinogen, and morphine or opioid antagonist. Moreover, one of its enantiomers was the first compound that was found to selectively label the σ1 receptor, and led to the discovery and characterization of the receptor. ==PharmacologyPharmacodynamics=== Alazocine shows stereoselectivity in its pharmacodynamics. The (–)-enantiomer is a non-selective and high-affinity ligand of the μ-, κ-, and δ-opioid receptors (Ki = 3.0, 4.7, and 15 nM in guinea pig brain membranes) with very low affinity for the sigma σ1 receptor (Ki = 1,800–4,657 nM in guinea pig brain membranes). It acts as a moderate- efficacy partial agonist of the κ-opioid receptor (Ki = 0.4 nM, EC50 = 24 nM, and Emax = 66% for (±)-alazocine against the mouse receptor transfected in HEK293 cells) and as an antagonist of the μ-opioid receptor (Ki = 1.15 nM for (±)-alazocine against the mouse receptor transfected in HEK293 cells). It is also an agonist of the δ-opioid receptor with far lower potency (Ki = not reported, IC50 = 184 nM, and = 68% for (±)-alazocine against the mouse receptor transfected in HEK293 cells). Conversely, the (+)-stereoisomer has little affinity for the opioid receptors (Ki for 1,900 nM, 1,600 nM, and 19,000 nM for the μ-, κ-, δ-opioid receptors in guinea pig brain membranes) and instead is a selective and high-affinity agonist of the σ1 receptor (Ki = 48–66 nM in guinea pig brain membranes). However, the (+)-enantiomer also shows moderate affinity for the dizocilpine (MK-801) or phencyclidine (PCP) site of the NMDA receptor (Ki = 587 nM in rat brain membranes relative to 45 nM for the σ1 receptor) and, hence, is an uncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist as well at higher concentrations. As such, (+)-alazocine is only modestly selective as a ligand of the σ1 receptor. Both enantiomers of alazocine have very low affinity for the sigma σ2 receptor (Ki = 13,694 nM and 4,581 nM for the (+)- and (–)-enantiomers, respectively, in rat brain membranes or rat PC12 cells). As such, due to its high affinity for the σ1 receptor, (+)-alazocine can be used to distinguish between the two sigma receptor subtypes in scientific research, for instance in radioligand binding assays. Taken together, (–)-alazocine is a selective partial agonist of the κ-opioid receptor, antagonist of the μ-opioid receptor, and to a far lesser extent agonist of the δ-opioid receptor with very low affinity for the sigma receptors, while (+)-alazocine is a selective agonist of the sigma σ1 receptor and to a lesser (~10-fold) extent antagonist of the NMDA receptor with low affinity for the opioid and sigma σ2 receptors. ==History== Alazocine was one of the early members of the benzomorphan family of opioid analgesics to be investigated. It was first described in the scientific literature in 1961. Its development resulted from nalorphine (N-allylnormorphine), a potent analgesic and opioid antagonist with similar pharmacology which had been introduced in the mid-1950s. Alazocine was found to produce strong psychotomimetic effects in humans, and it was not further developed for clinical use. Subsequently, other benzomorphans, such as pentazocine (an N-dimethylallylbenzomorphan), cyclazocine (an N-cyclopropylmethylbenzomorphan), and phenazocine (an N-phenylethylbenzomorphan), were developed, and some have been marketed for use as analgesics. The sigma σ1 receptor was named in 1976 and (+)-alazocine was described as its prototypical ligand. The receptor was initially thought to be an opioid receptor, and then was confused with the NMDA receptor for a time, but was ultimately distinguished from them both. The psychotomimetic effects of alazocine and the other benzomorphans were initially attributed incorrectly to agonism of the σ1 receptor; subsequent research established that the effects are in fact caused by agonism of the κ-opioid receptor and/or antagonism of the NMDA receptor. The sigma σ2 receptor was discovered and named in 1990, and was identified in part due to the dramatically reduced affinity of alazocine for the receptor relative to the σ1 receptor (in contrast to non-selective ligands like haloperidol, ditolylguanidine, and (+)-3-PPP, which show similar affinity for both subtypes). == References == Category:Allyl compounds Category:Analgesics Category:Benzomorphans Category:Delta-opioid agonists Category:Dissociative drugs Category:Kappa agonists Category:NMDA receptor antagonists Category:Opioid antagonists Category:Phenols Category:Sigma agonists ","title":"Alazocine"},{"id":"20511634","text":"Stanley Cramp (24 September 1913 – 20 August 1987) was a British civil servant and ornithologist best known as the first Chief Editor of the encyclopaedic nine-volume handbook The Birds of the Western Palearctic (BWP). Cramp was born in Stockport, Cheshire, the eldest son of Thomas and Edith Cramp. He gained a BA (Admin) in 1934 from Manchester University, studying at night school. He joined the Department of Customs and Excise in Manchester the same year and transferred to London in 1938. Apart from his war-time military service in the Royal Air Force from 1944 to 1946, he worked in London for the same Department until taking early retirement in 1970 to focus on BWP. Cramp took up birdwatching as a boy, and serious ornithology dominated much of his life. He was active in British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) and Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB), as well as the British Ornithologists Union (BOU), serving in various administrative positions in all three, as well as in many other bodies. He joined the editorial board of the journal British Birds in 1960 and became Senior Editor in 1963, a position he kept for the rest of his life. He was Vice Chairman of the Council for Environmental Conservation, known as CoEnCo, under Lord Craigton, and based in London. He appointed Edward Dawson as its Chief Officer in 1977. At that time he was also senior advisor to the European Commission on the Birds Directive. His unique insight led him to develop ideas of habitat protection, to complement the original purpose of stopping song birds being gunned down as they migrated south for the winter. For the last 17 years of his life Cramp devoted himself to producing BWP, a monumental task which ultimately affected his health. After seeing the first four volumes published, and initiating the fifth, his health deteriorated, though he continued to struggle on with the task. He died following a stroke and subsequent pneumonia. ==Honours== Honours awarded to Cramp include: * 1963 – Bernard Tucker Medal of the BTO * 1966 – Gold Medal of the RSPB * 1975 – OBE * 1978 – Stamford Raffles Medal of the Zoological Society of London * 1983 – Union Medal of the BOU ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Category:1913 births Category:1987 deaths Category:British ornithologists Category:20th- century zoologists Category:Officers of the Order of the British Empire Category:People from Stockport ","title":"Stanley Cramp"},{"id":"20511646","text":"The Security Intelligence Agency ('; abbr.

His mother (1897–1994) was born Carolina Elena Rangoni-Machiavelli-Publicola-Santacroce, 2nd. daughter of the Marchesa Alda Rangoni. He grew up in a trilingual house, and was educated in English boarding schools. His father returned to the United States early in 1939, and together with his mother and brother, the Botsfords were expelled from Italy on the outbreak of World War II. From then on, Botsford was educated in California, and, after 1941, at Portsmouth Abbey in New England. He was briefly attracted to the monastic life, but then continued his education at Yale University, leaving in 1946 to enlist in the US Army, where he served in counter-intelligence. He finished his formal university education at the University of Iowa (A.B., 1950) and at Yale with a Masters in French Literature (A.M., 1952). Botsford then went on to study composition at the Manhattan School of Music, Japanese at Columbia University, and law at Holborn College in London. He was attracted to music and composed a number of chamber works, a ballet, choral music and part-songs. With John Houseman, he worked in film, theater and television. Botsford's academic career, often combined with administrative tasks, began at Bard College in 1953, where he met his lifelong friend Saul Bellow.HighBeam In 1958, after two years in Europe living off translation, Botsford became assistant to the Rector of the University of Puerto Rico, taught Comparative Literature, founded the Honors Program and directed the University of Puerto Rico's television program. In 1962, Botsford was invited by his University of Iowa friend, John Hunt, to join the Congress for Cultural Freedom. He worked with the Congress for Cultural Freedom spending three years in Latin America, based in Rio de Janeiro and Mexico City. In 1965, he moved back to England to become Deputy International Secretary of International P.E.N., where he organized the Bled Round Tables, the first to which Soviet writers were invited. After serving at P.E.N., Botsford was invited to become the Director of the Ford Foundation's National Translation Center at the University of Texas, Austin (1965–1970), where he also was Professor of English. In 1971, Botsford returned to England where he began a 20-year career as a sports journalist with The Sunday Times. He also became a Feature Writer and columnist on Gastronomy for The Independent, which he joined in its first week. Botsford was also a features writer and U.S. correspondent for the Italian newspaper La Stampa. By the late 1970s, Botsford had combined his journalism with a post as Professor of Journalism and Lecturer in History at Boston University and a position as Assistant to the President John Silber. Botsford retired as Professor Emeritus at Boston University in 2006. He lived his last years in Costa Rica in a RIBA Award-winning house on the Caribbean coast, designed by his architect son, Gianni Botsford. Botsford had eight living children and sixteen grandchildren. He enjoyed smoking cigarettes and had been a pipe smoker. Botsford died in Battersea, England, in August 2018. ==As a novelist== Botsford's work as a novelist is divided into two periods: the first four novels – The Master Race [1955], The Eighth-best-dressed-Man in the World [1957], Benvenuto [1961] and The March-Man [1964] – were either semi- autobiographical or political in nature; his later books (after he returned to fiction in 1989) include three major autobiographical works: O Brother! [2000], The Mothers [2002], and Death and the Maiden [2007] form a coherent trilogy about his brother, his early wives (and mothers) and, in the last, a reprise of The March-Man, his father. During this second period he also published a series of stories and novellas, described as \\"imaginary biographies\\", collected in Out of Nowhere [2000]. At the same time he also wrote five non-fiction books on sporting figures and four crime and espionage novels under the pseudonym I.I. Magdalen. ==Awards== Botsford received grants from the Rockefeller Foundation and Moody Foundation, and a prize from the American Translators Association. ==Published worksBooks=== *Jozef Czapski: A Life in Translation (The Cahier Series, vol.10.

It was written, directed, edited and produced by student filmmaker Jerry Cavallaro for about $2,500. It stars Joe Moran, Jocelyn DeBoer and Patrick McColley. Lloyd Kaufman makes a cameo appearance. ==Plot== Charlie, played by Joe Moran, is a shy and geeky college student who is studying film production at an unnamed college. His roommate is the much more outgoing Rob, played by Patrick McColley. Their dorm room features walls covered with posters for horror and porn movies, as well as Christmas lights and cut out pictures of women's breasts, which is dubbed Rob's “wall of tits.” The room also features an unseen closet that is the home to all of Rob's drug paraphernalia. The film opens with a conversation about independent movies, which leads directly to the film's title. We then see Charlie and Rob in their film-201 classroom where Charlie fantasizes about Juliet, the girl who sits across from him. Juliet, played by Jocelyn DeBoer, seems to be a mixture of Charlie and Rob. She shares Charlie's main interests of horror movies and Kevin Smith, while being outgoing and a bit more vulgar like Rob. She also harbors feelings for Charlie, which is obvious the first time they interact on screen. Unfortunately, Charlie can't take a hint (or several dozen hints) and Rob develops a plan to get the two of them together. The next time Charlie helps Juliet in the editing bay, Rob convinces their bumbling Professor to end class early locking Charlie and Juliet in the classroom. Stuck spending the night together, Charlie and Juliet finally open up to each other. The film develops through a series of witty conversations and is filled with sharp dialogue, obscure movie references and indie film clichés.Stuck Like Chuck on IMDB ==Cast== *Joe Moran as Charlie *Jocelyn DeBoer as Juliet *Patrick McColley as Rob *Lloyd Kaufman as Mr. Kaufman *Igor Slootsky as Juliet's Date *Jerry Cavallaro as Jerry *Dave Fitzgerald as Weird Kid *Marianne Reddan as Chrissy ==Production== The film was made during the director's winter break and production continued after he started his Spring term. The movie was filmed almost entirely in two locations; the director's school and his grandma's house, which doubled as a dorm. He edited the film while still in school and actually finished the entire movie before the term ended. The film was made for a little under $4,000, all of which came from the director's pocket.Stuck Like Chuck Official Website ==Festivals== Stuck Like Chuck had its world premiere on June 6, 2009 as part of the SINY Film Festival.

This was said in a joking manner and should not be taken seriously. It is more likely that the film will take the usual route of playing at film festivals until a distributor picks it up. ==Advertising== The advertising for Stuck Like Chuck has consisted mostly of promotional videos posted on YouTube, Myspace, Funny Or Die and Facebook. The videos usually contain no actual footage from the film and each has some kind of a theme. One trailer speaks of a celebrity cameo appearing in the film but the name of the celebrity is not revealed. It has been joked about a few more times but the celebrity has not yet been revealed. On March 7, 2009, the first official trailer for the film was released. ===Stuck Like Chuck: The Trailer Trilogy=== The first trailer for Stuck Like Chuck was created in the style of an infomercial with the actors playing exaggerated versions of themselves pitching the film to the viewers. A second trailer was released a few weeks later, which was a follow up to the first trailer. This time, the actors still addressing the viewers apologize for the lack of clips from the actual film in the first trailer and invite the viewers to watch a compilation of behind the scenes footage and outtakes from the film set to a song from the movie. A third trailer, concludes the infomercial-like trailer trilogy, with Joe getting upset that people don't “get” the concept for the trailers.The Film's Official Myspace ===Netflix Movie Watching World Championship=== In an effort to promote Stuck Like Chuck, Jerry Cavallaro was a contestant in the Netflix Movie Watching World Championship, which took place in October 2008.

The resolution was in response to 15 September report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that stated that Iran had not suspended uranium-enrichment-related activities. The resolution reaffirmed four previous Security Council resolutions: 1696 (2006), 1737 (2006), 1747 (2007), and 1803 (2008). == Background == On 15 September 2008, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) released a report on the execution of Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) regulations in Iran. The report also investigated Iran's acquiescence to Security Council Resolutions 1737, 1747, and 1803. The report found conclusively that Iran was continuing along its path of non-compliance. In addition, the report included two important findings about Iran's non-compliance. The report found that Iran is making significant progress on developing and operating its centrifuges and that it continues to resist efforts to address its suspected nuclear weapons work. == 5984th Council Meeting == The 5984th meeting of the UN Security Council took place on 27 September 2008. The P5+1 countries; United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Russia, and the People's Republic of China, proposed the resolution. The resolution was passed unanimously. The meeting lasted from 4:05 pm to 4:10 pm. The representative of Indonesia voted in favor of the resolution despite making a statement before the vote was taken. The representative, who had abstained from voting for resolution 1803 in 2008, declared Indonesia's support for the resolution because it did not provide for additional sanctions against Iran. He emphasized Indonesia's desire for a negotiated solution, one that provided incentives, not \\"discentives\\" to Iran. == Public reaction  Iran === Iran dismissed the resolution, saying that its uranium development was for peaceful purposes and that it would not stop its uranium enrichment programs. The president of Iran, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad announced that his country would resist \\"bullying powers\\" trying to prevent nuclear development in Iran. The Chief Nuclear Negotiator, Saeed Jalili told Iranian television that the resolution would only foster \\"mistrust\\" stating, \\"These [resolutions] are not constructive. What they need to do is to attract the trust of the Iranian nation through constructive co-operation and collective commitment\\". === United States === Condoleezza Rice, the Secretary of State of the United States, declared US support for the resolution saying that it was a positive step that confirms the resolve of the international community and the P5+1. Rice also stated that the resolution lets \\"the Iranians know that the unity is very strong\\". === Russia === Vitaly Churkin, Russia's UN Representative, claimed that the idea for the resolution had been his country's. The week before the resolution was passed, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov pulled out of talks on Iran's nuclear program. Furthermore, Lavrov stated that it was Russian belief that the resolution helps further \\"the primary goal\\" of the P5+1, which is \\"to help the IAEA ascertain that there is no military dimension to the nuclear program in Iran\\". ==Termination== The provisions of Resolution 1835 were terminated by United Nations Security Council Resolution 2231 effective on Implementation Day of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, 16 January 2016. == References  External links == * *Text of the Resolution at undocs.org 1835 Category:United Nations Security Council sanctions regimes Category:Nuclear program of Iran Category:2008 in Iran 1835 1835 Category:September 2008 events ","title":"United Nations Security Council Resolution 1835"},{"id":"20511733","text":"is a former Japanese football player. ==Club statistics== {  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - ! colspan=3  Club performance ! colspan=2  League ! colspan=2  Cup ! colspan=2  League Cup ! colspan=2  Total - !

Hawthorne (born June 29, 1950) is a businessperson known for his expertise in direct response marketing, specializing in direct response television (DRTV). He founded Hawthorne Direct, the first advertising agency dedicated to producing infomercials. He is the author of The Complete Guide to Infomercial Marketing. He has been called \\"the king of the infomercial.\\"Rapp, Stan; Collins, Tom (1990). The Great Marketing Turnaround: The Age of the Individual—And How to Profit from It. Prentice-Hall. ==Education and early career== Hawthorne graduated cum laude from Harvard University in 1973, majoring in psychology. After learning about documentary film production with CBS and NBC network affiliate news divisions in Minneapolis and Philadelphia, he founded Hawthorne Productions in 1980 and was accepted into the Directors Guild of America. Early clients included the prime-time programs Real People and That’s Incredible! and the syndicated shows You Asked for It, Ripley’s Believe It or Not, and Entertainment Tonight. He also contributed programs to the Cable Health Network.Canon, Scott (1999). \\"Maharishi's Followers Have Integrated into Small Iowa Town\\". Kansas City Star, September 27, 1999.\\"Twenty Years In, Ready for 20 More\\". Response, September 2006. ==DRTV career== In October 1984, Hawthorne took $25,000 in start-up capital to co-found Fairfield Television Enterprises, Inc., a direct-response television marketing company. He served as president, producer, and creative visionary for the company, which became a major architect of the modern infomercial format. Hawthorne served as executive producer of the fourth long-form TV commercial to air in the modern era—a real estate home-study program that dominated the fledgling industry for two years, grossing over $60 million in sales. In July 1986, Hawthorne founded Hawthorne Communications, an advertising agency focused exclusively on direct response television (DRTV). The company produced early DRTV programs for such established brands as Apple, Nissan, and Time-Life and played a significant role in bringing respectability to a medium often derided for bogus products, cheesy demonstrations, and \\"yell-and-sell\\" spokespeople. In response to infomercials' poor public image, Hawthorne joined with eight colleagues in 1991 to found the National Infomercial Marketing Association (NIMA), which defined DRTV advertising guidelines and ethical standards. NIMA became the Electronic Retailing Association in 1997.http://retailing.org/mission In 1995, Hawthorne was named one of ResponseTV's \\"25 most influential people in DRTV,\\" and in 1996, USA Today and Ernst & Young recognized him as \\"Entrepreneur of the Year\\" for the Iowa/Nebraska region.http://www.dimagroup.com/html/newsletter/default.asp In 1997, Hawthorne re-branded his agency as Hawthorne Direct, which continues to focus on traditional and brand DRTV, as well as internet and mobile direct response. In 2001 Hawthorne and Time Life Direct won Questar's 'Best of Show' award for Julia Havey's \\"Take It Off w/ Julia\\" weight-loss informercial, the only weight-loss infomercial ever filmed by Time Life Direct.http://www.hawthornedirect.com/past_press_releases/2002/pr20020614_13.html ==DRTV firsts== Hawthorne is credited with a number of DRTV industry firsts. He was the first advocate of major brand advertisers incorporating long-form TV advertising in their media mix. He wrote the industry's most cited full- length textbook. He produced or managed the first infomercial for a Fortune 500 company (Time-Life), for a major credit card company (Discover Card), and a major health insurance company (Blue Cross). He created the first infomercial campaign for driving retail sales for an established brand (Braun). He oversaw the development of TimeTrack, the first software program dedicated to analyzing sales and viewership performance of purchased media time slots. He introduced the Media Efficiency Ratio (MER) key performance indicator, now a standard industry metric. He signed the first long-term bulk media contract with a national cable network, Discovery Channel (in 1985) for the airing of DRTV commercials, published the first newsletter devoted to DRTV (The 1-800 Report), and introduced the “three calls-to-action” formula—a staple in DRTV.

The game is a process of filming a movie on one of the 30 scenarios that can involve up to four people. Actions include the application of make-up, jogging in place, driving a car and playing volleyball. Previous video can be stored on the console, as well as to send to friends via e-mail. The game has met with mixed reviews, receiving criticism for the Xbox Live Vision Camera bundled with the game. ==Gameplay== You're in the Movies uses the bundled Xbox Live Vision camera where players are required to play mini-games by mimicking actions that will appear in a movie trailer, which are in a context of various science fiction, thriller, and adventure stories. Scores are awarded based on how closely each player manages to mimic the action required. Afterwards, players have to do a series of pick-up shots by assuming various facial expressions for the camera, such as an evil grin or a look of intense concentration. Videos can be shared to people in different households via links sent by Xbox through email. ==Development== Zoë Mode, who had previously experienced with camera games before, conceived the idea of the game from their V-screen technology they had used in their previous games. They were thinking how this technology could have its best use, and they thought a movie game would be a perfect fit. Andy Trowers, the lead designer of the game, stated the following: The developers first had to prove that the game all worked. They made what's called a \\"vertical slide\\" of the game, where they made one movie and they thought about all the games that would make the actions. Trowers said that they \\"wanted people to be able to share movies\\" and \\"give people the freedom to do what they wanted.\\" All of the movie themes and mini-games were conceived by the creative-design team, which they decided the movie themes would have an old B-movie feel. Trowers notes the making of the mini-games to be \\"quite an organic process\\": \\"Sometimes we'd have a movie and we'd say OK, we want the player to do this in the scene, which is the action we want, so try to think of a game idea for this. But other times we'd be thinking, \\"Oh, you know what, we got this great idea for a game and these are the essential actions we can get out of it, how are we going to use it in movies?\\" So it was really a three-way process, trying to figure out what we could get people to do, what would be fun, how it would fit in the movie—it wasn't just one process of doing it, it had to go both ways.\\" There had also been a few more movie ideas, but they were left out of the game. ==Release and promotion== The developers originally thought the game's target audience would be fairly adult-age. Towers notes: \\"We started out with an idea that the users are going to be fairly old, but then as we sort of made the game we focused it. We realized that lots of different people get fun out of the game in lots of different ways. We tested on young kids, we tested on adults, we tested on a mix of the two, and we came to the conclusion that anyone can play this game. We very much wanted the game to be accessible from the start so that you can play alongside your granny or with your kids. We saw people enjoying it from all ages.\\" At Microsoft's Press Conference at the E3 2008 conference in July, Shane Kim announced the game, along with Scene it: Box Office Smash. The feature in the game that allows players to star in trailers for fake movies was shown in the conference. The movie shows was entitled \\"Cold Blooded\\" and was about a giant, radioactive salamander. Other Gameplay Footage was also shown during the conference as well. It was later shown at the Games Convention one month later. Hollywood star Burt Reynolds fronted a series of TV and magazine advertising spots for the game. On October 23, 2008, Hollywood star Burt Reynolds fronted a series of TV and magazine advertising spots for the game. The commercials featured Reynolds using his long and illustrious career as a part of the tinsel town A-list, starring in more than 90 feature films to date, to show would be leading men and women how to become stars by transforming their living rooms into Hollywood studios, capturing the attention and participation of family and friends. Reynolds said it was \\"great to be able to share some of my experience with everyone about what it takes to be a movie star. You're in the Movies on Xbox 360 allows everyone to have a piece of the action and have a fun time with their friends and family, starring in their own features, from the comfort of their own homes.\\" The ads first premiered in North America on VH1 on November 18, 2008,Ashcraft, Brian.

Accessed from February 21, 2013. and aired in major European markets from November 28. ==Critical reception== You're in the Movies received generally mixed to negative reviews from critics. It currently holds a score of 55.92% on the aggregate gaming review site GameRankings. It also received, out of 100, a 55 from Metacritic based on 19 reviews. Video game reviewers from gaming websites and magazines mainly criticized the game for the Xbox Live Vision Camera bundled with the game. Even before the game's release, EyeToy's Sandy Spangler thought there would be some technical difficulties with players; he stated, \\"They're using some technical elements that are not reliable, at least not according to our experience. They're using background subtraction to put you in the movie, and it's not very robust, that's why we haven't done it in any of our games.\\"Welsh, Oliver. Eyeing the future. gamesindustry.biz. November 25, 2008. Accessed from November 20, 2012. Nate Ahearn from IGN, who gave the game a 4.2/10, referred to the Vision Camera as \\"an annoyance\\" that \\"handcuffs the entire experience.\\" Nate also criticized the pacing and the activities, which he called them \\"boring\\", stating \\"You’re in the Movies is bad, no matter how many beers you’ve consumed throughout the night.\\" Don Francis from GameSpot called it \\"a box-office bust, despite featuring your own recognizable stars.\\" and also criticized the voice acting which he called \\"annoying\\". He concluded \\"Despite the pack-in camera, the problems of You're in the Movies drag this would-be game down, making the $60 price tag much too high to justify. There are better party games on the Xbox 360, and less expensive ways to get a Vision Camera.\\" 1UP.com's Tyler Barber, who gave the game C+, called it more of \\"a video game, not an acting studio.\\" Eurogamer's Dan Whitehead was the harshest on the game, which he gave the game 2/10, stating \\"People don't live in movie studios. They live in houses and flats that are lit for comfort, not to fulfil the technical requirements of an ageing webcam. If you really want to put yourself and your friends on the TV, leave this failed experiment on the shelf, and put the money towards a digital camcorder instead.\\" ==References External links == * You're in the Movies at Xbox.com Category:2008 video games Category:Codemasters games Category:Party video games Category:Video games scored by Richard Jacques Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Xbox 360 games Category:Xbox 360-only games ","title":"You're in the Movies"},{"id":"20511811","text":"Aspira is a skyscraper in the Denny Triangle neighborhood of Seattle, Washington.

There are two general classes of MEAs: implantable MEAs, used in vivo, and non-implantable MEAs, used in vitro. ==Theory== Neurons and muscle cells create ion currents through their membranes when excited, causing a change in voltage between the inside and the outside of the cell. When recording, the electrodes on an MEA transduce the change in voltage from the environment carried by ions into currents carried by electrons (electronic currents). When stimulating, electrodes transduce electronic currents into ionic currents through the media. This triggers the voltage-gated ion channels on the membranes of the excitable cells, causing the cell to depolarize and trigger an action potential if it is a neuron or a twitch if it is a muscle cell. The size and shape of a recorded signal depend upon several factors: the nature of the medium in which the cell or cells are located (e.g. the medium's electrical conductivity, capacitance, and homogeneity); the nature of contact between the cells and the MEA electrode (e.g. area of contact and tightness); the nature of the MEA electrode itself (e.g. its geometry, impedance, and noise); the analog signal processing (e.g. the system's gain, bandwidth, and behavior outside of cutoff frequencies); and the data sampling properties (e.g. sampling rate and digital signal processing). For the recording of a single cell that partially covers a planar electrode, the voltage at the contact pad is approximately equal to the voltage of the overlapping region of the cell and electrode multiplied by the ratio the surface area of the overlapping region to the area of the entire electrode, or: V_{pad}=V_{overlap}\\\\times\\\\frac{A_{overlap}}{A_{electrode}} assuming the area around an electrode is well-insulated and has a very small capacitance associated with it. The equation above, however, relies on modeling the electrode, cells, and their surroundings as an equivalent circuit diagram. An alternative means of predicting cell-electrode behavior is by modeling the system using a geometry-based finite element analysis in an attempt to circumvent the limitations of oversimplifying the system in a lumped circuit element diagram. An MEA can be used to perform electrophysiological experiments on tissue slices or dissociated cell cultures. With acute tissue slices, the connections between the cells within the tissue slices prior to extraction and plating are more or less preserved, while the intercellular connections in dissociated cultures are destroyed prior to plating. With dissociated neuronal cultures, the neurons spontaneously form networks. It can be seen that the voltage amplitude an electrode experiences is inversely related to the distance from which a cell depolarizes. Thus, it may be necessary for the cells to be cultured or otherwise placed as close to the electrodes as possible. With tissue slices, a layer of electrically passive dead cells form around the site of incision due to edema. A way to deal with this is by fabricating an MEA with three-dimensional electrodes fabricated by masking and chemical etching. These 3-D electrodes penetrate the dead cell layer of the slice tissue, decreasing the distance between live cells and the electrodes. In dissociated cultures, proper adherence of the cells to the MEA substrate is important for getting robust signals. ==History== The first implantable arrays were microwire arrays developed in the 1950s. The first experiment involving the use of an array of planar electrodes to record from cultured cells was conducted in 1972 by C.A. Thomas, Jr. and his colleagues. The experimental setup used a 2 x 15 array of gold electrodes plated with platinum black, each spaced 100 µm apart from each other. Myocytes harvested from embryonic chicks were dissociated and cultured onto the MEAs, and signals up to 1 mV high in amplitude were recorded. MEAs were constructed and used to explore the electrophysiology of snail ganglia independently by Guenter Gross and his colleagues at the Center for Network Neuroscience in 1977 without prior knowledge of Thomas and his colleagues' work. In 1982, Gross observed spontaneous electrophysiological activity from dissociated spinal cord neurons, and found that activity was very dependent on temperature. Below about 30˚C signal amplitudes decrease rapidly to relatively small value at room temperature. Before the 1990s, significant entry barriers existed for new laboratories that sought to conduct MEA research due to the custom MEA fabrication and software they had to develop. However, with the advent of affordable computing power and commercial MEA hardware and software, many other laboratories were able to undertake research using MEAs. This non- invasive electrophysiology laboratory technique can be more efficient than the patch clamp method. ==Types== Microelectrode arrays can be divided up into subcategories based on their potential use: in vitro and in vivo arrays. ===In vitro arrays=== An in vitro MEA The standard type of in vitro MEA comes in a pattern of 8 x 8 or 6 x 10 electrodes. Electrodes are typically composed of indium tin oxide or titanium and have diameters between 10 and 30 μm. These arrays are normally used for single-cell cultures or acute brain slices. One challenge among in vitro MEAs has been imaging them with microscopes that use high power lenses, requiring low working distances on the order of micrometers. In order to avoid this problem, \\"thin\\"-MEAs have been created using cover slip glass. These arrays are approximately 180 μm allowing them to be used with high-power lenses. In another special design, 60 electrodes are split into 6 × 5 arrays separated by 500 μm. Electrodes within a group are separated by 30 um with diameters of 10 μm. Arrays such as this are used to examine local responses of neurons while also studying functional connectivity of organotypic slices. Spatial resolution is one of the key advantages of MEAs and allows signals sent over a long distance to be taken with higher precision when a high-density MEA is used. These arrays usually have a square grid pattern of 256 electrodes that cover an area of 2.8 by 2.8 mm. Increased spatial resolution is provided by CMOS-based high-density microelectrode arrays featuring thousands of electrodes along with integrated readout and stimulation circuits on compact chips of the size of a thumbnail. Even the resolution of signals propagating along single axons has been demonstrated. In order to obtain quality signals electrodes and tissue must be in close contact with one another. The perforated MEA design applies negative pressure to openings in the substrate so that tissue slices can be positioned on the electrodes to enhance contact and recorded signals. A different approach to lower the electrode impedance is by modification of the interface material, for example by using carbon nanotubes, or by modification of the structure of the electrodes, with for example gold nanopillars or nanocavities. ===In vivo arrays=== Schematic of the \\"Utah\\" in vivo electrode array The three major categories of implantable MEAs are microwire, silicon-based, and flexible microelectrode arrays. Microwire MEAs are largely made of stainless steel or tungsten and they can be used to estimate the position of individual recorded neurons by triangulation. Silicon-based microelectrode arrays include two specific models: the Michigan and Utah arrays. Michigan arrays allow a higher density of sensors for implantation as well as a higher spatial resolution than microwire MEAs. They also allow signals to be obtained along the length of the shank, rather than just at the ends of the shanks. In contrast to Michigan arrays, Utah arrays are 3-D, consisting of 100 conductive silicon needles. However, in a Utah array, signals are only received from the tips of each electrode, which limits the amount of information that can be obtained at one time. Furthermore, Utah arrays are manufactured with set dimensions and parameters while the Michigan array allows for more design freedom. Flexible arrays, made with polyimide, Parylene, or benzocyclobutene, provide an advantage over rigid microelectrode arrays because they provide a closer mechanical match, as the Young's modulus of silicon is much larger than that of brain tissue, contributing to shear-induced inflammation. ==Data processing methods== The fundamental unit of communication of neurons is, electrically, at least, the action potential. This all-or-nothing phenomenon originates at the axon hillock, resulting in a depolarization of the intracellular environment which propagates down the axon. This ion flux through the cellular membrane generates a sharp change in voltage in the extracellular environment, which is what the MEA electrodes ultimately detect. Thus, voltage spike counting and sorting is often used in research to characterize network activity. Spike train analysis, can also save processing time and computing memory compared to voltage measurements. Spike timestamps are identified as times where the voltage measured by an individual electrode exceeds a threshold (often defined by standard deviations from the mean of an inactive time period). These timestamps can be further processed to identify bursts(multiple spikes in close proximity). Further analysis of these trains can reveal spike organization and temporal patterns. ==CapabilitiesAdvantages=== In general, the major strengths of in vitro arrays when compared to more traditional methods such as patch clamping include: *Allowing the placement of multiple electrodes at once rather than individually *The ability to set up controls within the same experimental setup (by using one electrode as a control and others as experimental). This is of particular interest in stimulation experiments. *The ability to select different recordings sites within the array *The ability to simultaneously receive data from multiple sites *Recordings from intact retinae are of great interest because of the possibility of delivering real-time optical stimulation and, for instance, the possibility of reconstructing receptive fields. Furthermore, in vitro arrays are non-invasive when compared to patch clamping because they do not require breaching of the cell membrane. With respect to in vivo arrays however, the major advantage over patch clamping is the high spatial resolution. Implantable arrays allow signals to be obtained from individual neurons enabling information such as position or velocity of motor movement that can be used to control a prosthetic device. Large-scale, parallel recordings with tens of implanted electrodes are possible, at least in rodents, during animal behavior. This makes such extracellular recordings the method of choice to identify of neural circuits and to study their functions. Unambiguous identification of the recorded neuron using multi-electrode extracellular arrays, however, remains a problem to date. ===Disadvantages=== In vitro MEAs are less suited for recording and stimulating single cells due to their low spatial resolution compared to patch clamp and dynamic clamp systems. The complexity of signals an MEA electrode could effectively transmit to other cells is limited compared to the capabilities of dynamic clamps. There are also several biological responses to implantation of a microelectrode array, particularly in regards to chronic implantation. Most notable among these effects are neuronal cell loss, glial scarring, and a drop in the number of functioning electrodes. The tissue response to implantation is dependent among many factors including size of the MEA shanks, distance between the shanks, MEA material composition, and time period of insertion. The tissue response is typically divided into short term and long term response. The short term response occurs within hours of implantation and begins with an increased population of astrocytes and glial cells surrounding the device. The recruited microglia then initiate inflammation and a process of phagocytosis of the foreign material begins. Over time, the astrocytes and microglia recruited to the device begin to accumulate, forming a sheath surrounding the array that extends tens of micrometres around the device. This not only increases the space between electrode probes, but also insulates the electrodes and increases impedance measurements. Problems with chronic implantation of arrays have been a driving force in the research of these devices. One novel study examined the neurodegenerative effects of inflammation caused by chronic implantation.McConnell GC, Rees HD, Levey AI, Gross RG, Bellamkonda RV. 2008. Chronic electrodes induce a local, neurodegenerative state: Implications for chronic recording reliability. Society for Neuroscience, Washington, D.C Immunohistochemical markers showed a surprising presence of hyperphosphorylated tau, an indicator of Alzheimer's disease, near the electrode recording site. The phagocytosis of electrode material also brings to question the issue of a biocompatibility response, which research suggests has been minor and becomes almost nonexistent after 12 weeks in vivo. Research to minimize the negative effects of device insertion includes surface coating of the devices with proteins that encourage neuron attachment, such as laminin, or drug eluting substances. ==ApplicationsIn vitro=== The nature of dissociated neuronal networks does not seem to change or diminish the character of its pharmacological response when compared to in vivo models, suggesting that MEAs can be used to study pharmacological effects on dissociated neuronal cultures in a more simple, controlled environment. A number of pharmacological studies using MEAs on dissociated neuronal networks, e.g. studies with ethanol. In addition, a substantial body of work on various biophysical aspects of network function was carried out by reducing phenomena usually studied at the behavioral level to the dissociated cortical network level. For example, the capacity of such networks to extract spatial and temporal features of various input signals, dynamics of synchronization, sensitivity to neuromodulation and kinetics of learning using closed loop regimes. Finally, combining MEA technology with confocal microscopy allows for studying relationships between network activity and synaptic remodeling. MEAs have been used to interface neuronal networks with non-biological systems as a controller. For example, a neural-computer interface can be created using MEAs. Dissociated rat cortical neurons were integrated into a closed stimulus-response feedback loop to control an animat in a virtual environment. A closed-loop stimulus-response system has also been constructed using an MEA by Potter, Mandhavan, and DeMarse, and by Mark Hammond, Kevin Warwick, and Ben Whalley in the University of Reading. About 300,000 dissociated rat neurons were plated on an MEA, which was connected to motors and ultrasound sensors on a robot, and was conditioned to avoid obstacles when sensed. Along these lines, Shimon Marom and colleagues in the Technion hooked dissociated neuronal networks growing on MEAs to a Lego Mindstorms robot; the visual field of the robot was classified by the network, and commands were delivered to the robot wheels such that it completely avoids bumping into obstacles. This \\"Braitenberg vehicle\\" was used to demonstrate the indeterminacy of reverse neuro-engineering showing that even in a simple setup with practically unlimited access to every piece of relevant information, it was impossible to deduce with certainty the specific neural coding scheme that was used to drive the robots behavior. MEAs have been used to observe network firing in hippocampal slices. ===In vivo=== There are several implantable interfaces that are currently available for consumer use including deep brain stimulators, cochlear implants, and cardiac pacemakers. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been effective at treating movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease, and cochlear implants have helped many to improve their hearing by assisting stimulation of the auditory nerve. Because of their remarkable potential, MEAs are a prominent area of neuroscience research. Research suggests that MEAs may provide insight into processes such as memory formation and perception and may also hold therapeutic value for conditions such as epilepsy, depression, and obsessive-compulsive disorder . Clinical trials using interface devices for restoring motor control after spinal cord injury or as treatment for ALS have been initiated in a project entitled BrainGate (see video demo: BrainGate). MEAs provide the high resolution necessary to record time varying signals, giving them the ability to be used to both control and obtain feedback from prosthetic devices, as was shown by Kevin Warwick, Mark Gasson and Peter Kyberd. Research suggests that MEA use may be able to assist in the restoration of vision by stimulating the optic pathway. ==MEA user meetings== A biannual scientific user meeting is held in Reutlingen, organized by the Natural and Medical Sciences Institute (NMI) at the University of Tübingen. The meetings offer a comprehensive overview of all aspects related to new developments and current applications of Microelectrode Arrays in basic and applied neuroscience as well as in industrial drug discovery, safety pharmacology and neurotechnology. The biannual conference has developed into an international venue for scientists developing and using MEAs from both industry and academia, and is recognized as an information- packed scientific forum of high quality. The meeting contributions are available as open access proceeding books. ==Use in art== In addition to being used for scientific purposes, MEAs have been used in contemporary art to investigate philosophical questions about the relationship between technology and biology. Traditionally within Western thought, biology and technology have been separated into two distinct categories: bios and technê.Thacker, Eugene (2010) \\"What is Biomedia?\\" in \\"Critical Terms for Media Studies\\" University of Chicago Press.

MEART was first exhibited to the public in the exhibition Biofeel at the Perth Institute of Contemporary Arts in 2002. ==See also== *Animat *Artificial cardiac pacemaker *Deep brain stimulation *Patch clamp *Bioelectronics ==References== Category:Neurophysiology Category:Physiology Category:Electrophysiology Category:Laboratory techniques ","title":"Microelectrode array"},{"id":"20511952","text":"La statue (The Statue) is an opera in three acts and five tableaux by Ernest Reyer to the libretto by Michel Carré and Jules Barbier based on tales from One Thousand and One Nights and La statue merveilleuse, an 1810 carnival play (pièce foraine) by Alain-René Lesage and Jacques-Philippe d'Orneval. Although in its story opera possesses a certain Oriental climate, musically it has very little resemblance to its locale, remaining in core of the French music tradition of 18th and early 19th century. It was originally conceived and performed as an opéra comique (with some spoken dialogue instead of all recitatives).But even in the first version of the opera the only spoken dialogue is in the first tableau of act 1 (entrance of Amgiad), and in all other instances usual operatic recitatives are used. ==Performance history== The opera received its premiere at the Théâtre Lyrique on 11 April 1861Note that P. Scudo's review (see Wiki-sources) contains date of premiere as \\"April 6\\" which contradicts with any other known sources. Perhaps it was general rehearsal he attended, or there is some typo in that French text at Wiki- sources. and was very successful (Jules Massenet, who at that time himself participated in that performance (playing timpani in the orchestra), described it as \\"a superb score and tremendous success\\"J. Massenet My recollections, p. 24). Until the year 1863 it received total of 59 performances, impressive figure for those times. It was then performed in Brussels at La Monnaie in 1865, at the Opéra-Comique in Paris in 1878, Monte Carlo in 1890 and finally in completely revised version the Paris Opéra in 1903 (at that time receiving only just 10 performances). Since that time it has slipped into total oblivion and has not been performed ever since. ==Versions== La statue is known to have two distinct versions. Both versions have three acts in common, but in the revised one the most of music from act 2 was substantially altered, the comic element being completely removed. Although even in original version optional first ballet was included, in later version it was substantially expanded (long second ballet was added in place of the cut vocal music: the Duo bouffe (between Kaloum and Amgiad), Margyane's Romance (or aria), and Selim's Cavatina. Pages of choral music were significantly altered or cut. Only the second part of that act, starting from Margyane's Strophes and the Finale was mostly preserved. Also, in the revised version, the Mouck's couplets from the first act and the small incidental role for Ali (the second tenor) from the second act were eliminated. ==Timing== Based on approximate estimate from playback of the vocal and piano reduction scores, total timing of the piece is as follows: Act 1 – 53 minutes Act 2 – 57 minutes (including ballet 37 min. in the final version for the Opéra) Act 2 – 47 minutes (in the original version, without ballet) Act 3 – 34 minutes ==Roles== {  !Role !Voice type !Premiere Cast, 11 April 1861 (Conductor: Adolphe Deloffre) - Margyane soprano Marie-Julie Baretti - Sélim tenor Jules-Sébastien Monjauze - Mouck tenor Adolphe Girardot - Amgiad bass (or baritone) Mathieu-Émile Balanqué - Kaloum-Barouck baritone (or comic bass) Émile Wartel - Ali tenor Jean-Blaise Martin - } ==InstrumentationChester-Novello Hire Library on La statue holdings== * Woodwinds: 2 flutes (incl. piccolo), 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons * Brass: 4 French horns, 4 trumpets, 4 trombones * Timpani, percussion * Strings, 2 harps ==Place and time== Act 1: Damascus, Arabian desert Act 2: Mecca Act 3: Arabian desert Time: Legendary ==SynopsisAct 1=== A young Arab of the town of Damascus, Sélim, very rich and very voluptuous, is bored, because he exhausted with the fortune his father left him the source of any pleasure. Now, with others, he is seen engaged in opium smoking (Choir \\"Ô vapeur embaumée\\"). Overwhelmed with languor, without illusions, and soon running out of money, Sélim is not quite sure what folly to engage next, when the mighty genie Amgiad presents himself in the form of a dervish. He tells him first everything which he must say about the dervish who, as the rule, is doomed to poverty and wisdom, and then he adds: \\"the powerful genie Amgiad, the protector and friend of your family, sends me to you to tell you he has pity on thy fate. If you want a little help and follow my advice, I'll get you to the center of the earth where you will find all the riches you can imagine.\\" He exacts then a pledge on Sélim to meet him at the certain place and hour and disappears. With these promises that excite the imagination of an Arab, Sélim comes to senses and rushes in the desert in pursuit of the chimera. Followed by his faithful slave Mouck, Sélim arrives exhausted at the ruins of the ancient city of Baalbek. There he meets a young girl beside a fountain (duet \\"Mais, je veux te connaître\\"). The girl offers him refreshing drink, and he, after quenching his thirst, feel the natural desire to see features of the young stranger who has been so compassionate. Margyane is her name. She is poor, her mother died when she was young, and now even her father is no more, so she is on the way to join her uncle in the Holy City. The caravan is waiting. She resists his advances at first, but word by word she is overwhelmed by intimate atmosphere and his boldness and her heart slowly yields to him. On request of Sélim she shows him her smile after lifting her veil a little. He declares his love to her. They kiss. But that is too much for her at the moment. Doubting him and afraid, fighting her own passion and natural desires, she withdraw and goes away leaving confused Sélim behind. In meantime the all watchful Amgiad appears at that same place, as it is exactly the place where they arranged previously their meeting. Once again he assures pledge from Sélim that the treasury is really all what he wants but, being a witness to the conclusion of the romantic encounter, warns him of power of love. But disappointed with his not quite successful conquest and deeply unsatisfied Sélim says he is ready and determined. By the power of his magic, Amgiad opens for him the gate to the underground kingdom and Sélim jumps there promptly to fulfill his destiny. In meantime Margyane returns and, not seeing him around anymore, disappointed (\\"Hélas! il n'est plus là...\\"), joins the caravan to her far destination. When Sélim returns, overwhelmed and dazzled, he enthusiastically reports to his servant what he just saw: Down there, among other wonders, stand twelve statues carved in gold and diamonds and the thirteenth pedestal empty still with the statue missing but more he looked at it the more it occurred of unparalleled richness and beauty. That thirteenth statue worth not enough of whole treasure even a king would pay will be granted to him, Sélim, if he agrees to marry an innocent and poor girl whom he will then be obliged to deliver there, pure and chaste. That promise he granted to the spirits of earth, not realizing as yet awaiting him a twist. ===Act 2=== In the next act we are transported into the Holy City of Mecca, to the mansion of an old rich merchant of olives, Kaloum-Barouck, where wedding ceremony is under way. Following the advice of the \\"dervish,\\" Sélim did ask to marry the niece of Kaloum-Barouck. (In the original Théâtre Lyrique version it was Mouck who came here first to ask, in the name of his master, for the hand of his niece in marriage. But violent Kaloum, who planned to marry his niece himself, welcome the messenger with sticks instead. Only by intervention of Amgiad the trouble is averted, as he arrives here as Kaloum's identical double, causes his total confusion and finally throws him out of the house, and - as Kaloum - sanctions the marriage of young lovers.) The long and elaborate ballet scene follows. When the ceremony is concluded in the presence of the Qadi (Amgiad himself in disguise), and when at last Sélim is allowed to see the face of his wife, he recognizes her at once: Alas! The girl he met in the desert, Margyane, whom he loves and who now loves him in return! At the climax of the whole scene he, deeply and mysteriously shaken to all present, recollects suddenly, to his horror, the promise he once granted to the underground guardians that he must now fulfill under the pain of eternal punishment: to surrender his new and only love as a payment for the treasure he previously so desired. He does not dare as yet to make the full admission of his horrible situation to Margyane, however, as the act ends. ===Act 3=== Sélim is traveling in the desert with his servant and newly wed wife, Margyane. Among violent storm (simoom), a desperate fight undertakes in the soul of Sélim between his love for Margyane and the promise he had made to Amgiad and underground spirits. He now confesses to her, asking for forgiveness, cursing his former folly and desire for riches, now conjuring his fidelity, pledging that he is determined, by all cost, to keep her instead. In the middle of his struggle, when he convinced her of his love (their second love duet), Amgiad appears suddenly, as previously under the disguise of the dervish, coming now to claim his prey. They are left alone. But no threats, no arguments from Amgiad, no scary voices of underground spirits warning him of eternal punishment for breaking his vow are enough for Sélim to betray his love now. Seeing such determination Amgiad is almost ready to leave when Margyane, who witnessed half of their conversation and horrific voices, suddenly bars his exit, demanding that he rather should take her, that she does not desire to be an object for breaking such terrible vow, stating that she, from pure love to him, will rather willingly sacrifice herself than be the cause of his eternal punishment. Sélim draws his dagger, ready to defend her with his own life. But one sign of hand from Amgiad is enough to stop such silly move short: he then plunges Sélim in a gentle sleep taking away tearful Margyane. Sélim wakes up soon after they left, barely remembering what happened to him. Now underground voices announce that since he fulfilled his pledge after all, and the magical thirteenth statue belongs to him. To his horror he fully recollects and, discovering Margyane gone, full of love and rage, cursing his previous folly and desire, he takes his servant and they rush to collect the promised riches, but with the wild determination to smash the statue which cost him so dearly. But at the crucial moment when he is about to strike the fatal blow of destruction, he sees rising empty pedestal and Margyane herself standing there, smiling and promptly falling into his arms. Among general jubilation, Amgiad appears in magnificent costume of the genie, the master of all jinni, and he says these words, which form the conclusion and the moral of the fable: Il est un trésor Plus rare que l’or De toute la terre, Plus pur que le jour: C’est le doux mystère Qu’on appelle amour. (It is a treasure Rarer than gold Of all the Earth. More pure than the day: It's sweet mystery Called love.) ==Recordings== Although no known commercial recording made by live orchestras of it exists, complete recordings of music of La statue were made and they are now available: a free recording (arrangement for piano sextet) available at IMSLP,Music of La statue recording at IMSLP and a commercial recording using VST in new orchestration done by Voytek Gagalka at Amazon.com.La statue - Opera Without Words, CD1 and CD2 Excerpts from the latter is introduced at YouTube. ==References== *La statue by Ernest Reyer, piano reduction (vocal) scores at Wiki-IMSLP *La statue by Ernest Reyer, full conductor score in new orchestration (2012) by Voytek Gagalka *Revue musicale, 1861/03, the Review of the premiere at the Théâtre Lyrique by P.

The 39-story tower, developed by Urban Visions and designed by Tom Kundig of Olson Kundig Architects, has 339 luxury apartments and several ground-level retail spaces. The 8th floor includes a bar overlooking the Pike Place Market, located a block west. The project was also known as the Candela Hotel & Residences from 2007 to 2009 and was planned to include a hotel in addition to luxury condominiums. After Candela was removed from the project, the revised skyscraper proposal was approved in 2011 but would later undergo further changes in 2013. Construction did not begin until July 2015 due to financing issues that were later resolved. The building topped out in August 2017 and was completed in March 2018. ==History== The MacDougall & Southwick department store, located at the southeast corner of 2nd Avenue & Pike Street until 1971. The site, located at the southeast corner of 2nd Avenue and Pike Street in downtown Seattle, was home to the MacDougall & Southwick department store until the store closed in 1966. The five-story building was later demolished in 1971 and replaced with a surface parking lot. Planning for a skyscraper at the site began in 2004, with developer Greg Smith of Urban Visions proposing a 27-story residential tower on the parking lot, which was zoned for an 11-story height limit. In 2006, the design was revised in response to major revisions to the downtown zoning code by the Seattle City Council. The following year, luxury hotel company Candela Hotels announced plans to build its flagship hotel inside of the building at 2nd & Pike in addition to luxury condominiums planned by Urban Visions, planned to open in 2010. The proposed design from Tom Kundig featured a glass tower that narrowed in the middle, with the top 13 floors cantilevered out from the rest of the building. Candela was later removed from the building's plans and the project was resubmitted as a 340-apartment tower by the developer in December 2009. The revised proposal was approved by the Seattle Department of Planning and Development on October 3, 2011. In January 2013, amid a growing number of similar apartment projects in the city, Urban Visions announced that the proposed building's height would be downsized to and converted to mixed-use by incorporating office space. The planned downsizing was later scrapped in favor of a 27-story, mixed-use proposal announced the following month. The mixed-use proposal, designed by Zimmer Gunsul Frasca Partnership, featured a viewing terrace facing towards the Pike Place Market and a design that was dubbed a \\"tree tower\\". The design was dropped in favor of a more conventional design from Tom Kundig of Olson Kundig Architects; Urban Visions later secured funding from Japanese real estate developer Mitsui Fudosan's American office in December 2014, allowing the project to move forward. Construction on the site began on July 23, 2015, under general contractor Sellen Construction. The building was topped out in August 2017, with the completion of the 39th floor. The building opened in March 2018. The construction staging area for the project necessitated the closure of a protected bike lane on 2nd Avenue that was replaced with a covered lane separated from the street by water-filled plastic jersey barriers. ==Gallery== File:West Edge Tower under construction, February 2016 (25000284819).jpgFebruary 2016 File:2nd & Pike under construction, Downtown Seattle (31483790023).jpgDecember 2016 2nd and Pike, Seattle - May 2017.jpgMay 2017 ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:Residential skyscrapers in Seattle Category:Residential buildings completed in 2018 ","title":"West Edge Tower"},{"id":"20512019","text":"Paul G.

He was born in the city Chichibu, Saitama and started judo in his childhood. His father was a 6th Dan in judo and his uncle a 9th Dan. Sone is a university-trained judoka from Meiji University. After that he belonged to Fuji Iron & Steel. As fifth dan, measuring 5 feet and 10 1/2 inches in height and weighing 215 pounds, he received a gold medal at the 1958 World Judo Championships in Tokyo against teammate and 4th dan Akio Kaminaga. Sone was surprisingly eliminated in the second round of the 1960 All-Japan Judo Championships, a contemporary report by the martial artist Donn F. Draeger calling his performance there a \\"pitiful sight\\" and mentioning that he was aging. Sone won a silver medal at the 1961 World Judo Championships in Paris, behind Anton Geesink. His loss against Geesink, 5th dan, was heralded as the end of the era in which the best Japanese judokas could not be defeated by foreigners. Within nine minutes of the 20-minute contest, a foot sweep forced Sone onto the ground where he was held for the necessary 30 seconds with a Mune-gatame. Despite that, many believed that Sone was the technically better judoka. At the age of 33 Sone was relatively old for a judoka. It would be the last World Championship without a division into weight classes. After the loss against Geesink, Sone became coach of the Japanese judo team. Sone was accused by Geesink's teammates in the 1965 World Judo Championships of having Seiji Sakaguchi lose against the more rested Matsunaga to have Matsunaga take on the weary Geesink in the final round. Matsunaga still lost, Geesink winning the heavy-weight title by decision. But the Japanese team hoped to beat him with Isao Inokuma in the all-weight class the next day. Before the match, however, Geesink quit. The jubilant Japanese team carried Sone on their shoulders and paraded him around the gym. In 1977 he achieved the rank of 8th Dan. In 1981 he died of cerebral hemorrhage in Tokyo. ==Achievements== *1954 - All-Japan Championships (Openweight only) loss *1955 - All-Japan Championships (Openweight only) 3rd *1957 - All-Japan Championships (Openweight only) 2nd *1958 - World Championships (Openweight only) 1st :: - All-Japan Championships (Openweight only) 1st *1961 - World Championships (Openweight only) 2nd ==External links== *Video of Sone's fight against Geesink *Photograph of him (with the actress Fujiko Yamamoto) ==References== Category:Japanese male judoka Category:1928 births Category:1981 deaths ","title":"Koji Sone"},{"id":"20512200","text":"Akasha Gloria Hull (born December 6, 1944) is a poet, educator, writer, and critic whose work in African-American literature and as a Black feminist activist has helped shape Women's Studies. As one of the architects of Black Women's Studies, her scholarship and activism has increased the prestige, legitimacy, respect, and popularity of feminism and African-American studies. Hull has been a professor of women's studies and literature at the University of California, Santa Cruz, the University of Delaware, and the University of the West Indies, Mona, in Kingston, Jamaica. She has published four books, a monograph, three edited collections, over twenty articles in peer-reviewed professional journals, numerous chapters in a dozen volumes, fifteen book reviews, poems in more than thirty magazines and anthologies, and two short stories. Her first novel, Neicy, was released in October 2012. She lives in Little Rock, Arkansas. ==Biography== Hull was born Gloria Theresa Thompson in Shreveport, Louisiana (USA), on December 6, 1944. Her father was a carpenter and laborer, her mother a maid and cook. She graduated valedictorian from Booker T. Washington High School in Shreveport and summa cum laude from Southern University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. During these years, she was a valuable member (as a pianist and member of the choir) at Shreveport's Zion Baptist Church. She was also secretary for the local chapter of the NAACP and a member of the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority. After graduating from high school, Hull matriculated at Purdue University, where she earned her Master's and Ph.D. degrees in English Literature. She married on June 12, 1966; she and her husband, Prentice Roy Hull, also a graduate student, had their only child, Adrian Prentice Hull, at this time. They divorced in 1984. Subsequently, she married again (divorced in 1991) and entered into a California domestic partnership (dissolved in 2006). ==Black women's studies, feminism, and African-American studies== Hull was a member of the Combahee River Collective, a Black feminist group active in Boston in the late 1970s.Harris, Duchess. \\"From the Kennedy Commission to the Combahee Collective\\", in Collier-Thomas et al. (eds), Sisters in the Struggle, New York University Press, 2001, , p. 283. Membership in the collective catalyzed her focus as a scholar, activist, and critic. It was during this period that she co-edited the book All the Women Are White, All the Blacks Are Men, But Some of Us Are Brave: Black Women's Studies with Patricia Bell-Scott and Barbara Smith.. Printed in numerous editions, it is a classic in Feminist Studies, Black Studies, and Black Women's Studies. Her landmark scholarship directed attention to the lives of Black women and, combined with the numerous articles she wrote thereafter, helped remedy the emphasis within Feminist Studies on white women and within Black studies on Black men.. The National Institute conferred on Hull its Women of Color Award for this accomplishment. In 1986 Hull published Give Us Each Day: The Diary of Alice Dunbar-Nelson, only the second published diary by an African-American woman in the US.. The New York Times gave it an enthusiastic review.. Give Us Each Day revealed the life and times of Alice Dunbar-Nelson, a fascinating poet-journalist who until then had been eclipsed by her more famous husband, the renowned dialect poet and writer Paul Laurence Dunbar. Hull's book Color, Sex, and Poetry: Three Women Writers of the Harlem Renaissance continued to highlight the rich contributions of women to that pivotal era.. Its painstaking archival research revealed for the first time unsuspected homoerotic connections among the women and lesbian themes in their writings. ==Poetry, nonfiction, and fictional works== Akasha Hull's poetry was first published in Women: A Journal of Liberation in the 1970s. Since then her poems have been featured in such collections as Flatfooted Truths, Life Prayers, Sisterfire, In Search of Color Everywhere, Daughters of Africa, Erotique Noire, Callaloo, and Shout Out: Women of Color Respond to Violence. Ntozake Shange called Hull's book Healing Heart: Poems (published by Kitchen Table: Women of Color Press) “the voice of a free, fiercesome, sensual and vivid woman of color,\\" while the esteemed critic Stephen E. Henderson applauded it as “a total delight.\\" In her book Soul Talk: The New Spirituality of African-American Women, Hull examines the burgeoning of metaphysical and “New Age” modalities after 1980, and states that politics, spirituality, and creativity are being united into a revolutionary new paradigm. Nobel Prize Laureate Toni Morrison and literary activist E. Ethelbert Miller endorsed it, while Publishers Weekly praised it as \\"powerful, practical and nourishing gumbo ... of the heart and spirit.\\" In 2006 Hull moved to Little Rock, Arkansas, and devoted herself to writing fiction. She was a semifinalist (top 20 of 300) in the Ursula K. Le Guin Imaginative Fiction Contest of Rosebud Magazine for “'Touch Me,' They Said, They Wanted.” Her short story \\"Plum Jelly in Hot Shiny Jars\\" appeared in the 2003 Beacon Press anthology Age Ain't Nothing but a Number: Black Women Explore Midlife. In 2012 she completed her first novel. Her novel is, Hull says, the story \\"of a Black actress going through a lot of love, sex, sexuality, personal enlightenment -- it's not autobiographical, but it's all me.\\" ==Public appearances, activism, and awards== Hull has been the keynote speaker at numerous university and community conferences throughout the United States; given lectures and readings at numerous bookstores and other venues; been interviewed on National Public Radio about the poets of the Harlem Renaissance; participated in grassroots and professional feminist organizing; and presented workshops on multiculturalism, spirituality, creativity, and self-empowerment.. These appearances include Michigan's Everywoman's Festival, the American Library Association, the New York Open Center, the Center for the Book of the Library of Congress, a 30th Class Reunion speech, as well as conversations with notable authors Toni Cade Bambara, Gwendolyn Brooks, Maya Angelou, Alice Walker, and Octavia Butler.. She has received prestigious fellowships from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Fulbright, Rockefeller, Mellon and Ford Foundations, the American Association of University Women, and the National Humanities Center. In 1992, Purdue University awarded her an Honorary Doctor of Letters \\"for pioneering work in the field of black feminist studies that has empowered others to hear and appreciate diverse voices.\\" ==Spirituality and name change== Over the course of her life, Hull has studied and/or practiced Southern Baptist Christianity, Rastafari, Santeria, metaphysics, meditation, the Alice Bailey teachings, and Buddhism. She has traveled in Brazil, Mexico, Canada, Japan, the Caribbean, England, Ghana, Hawaii, and Costa Rica. These experiences helped shape her research, poetry, and nonfiction and fiction writings. In 1992 Hull legally changed her name from Gloria Theresa Thompson to Akasha Hull. Her chosen first name is a Sanskrit word that means \\"light/luminous\\". ==References== Category:African- American women writers Category:American women writers Category:American writers Category:Feminist studies scholars Category:African-American feminists Category:American feminists Category:Living people Category:Women's studies academics Category:1944 births Category:Activists from Louisiana Category:African-American writers Category:Members of the Combahee River Collective ","title":"Akasha Gloria Hull"},{"id":"20512215","text":"The Oranj Symphonette is an experimental jazz-rock quintet from San Francisco, USA, formed from members of Tom Waits' band.

Historical observations are sparse and insufficient for understanding the history of the ocean and its circulation. By utilizing data assimilation techniques in combination with advanced computational models of the global ocean, researchers are able to interpolate the historical observations to all points in the ocean. This process has an analog in the construction of atmospheric reanalysis and is closely related to ocean state estimation. ==Current projects== A number of efforts have been initiated in recent years to apply data assimilation to estimate the physical state of the ocean, including temperature, salinity, currents, and sea level, in recent years.Carton, J.A., and A. Santorelli, 2008: Global upper ocean heat content as viewed in nine analyses, J. Clim., 21, 6015–6035. There are three alternative state estimation approaches. The first approach is used by the ‘no-model’ analyses, for which temperature or salinity observations update a first guess provided by climatological monthly estimates. The second approach is that of the sequential data assimilation analyses, which move forward in time from a previous analysis using a numerical simulation of the evolving temperature and other variables produced by an ocean general circulation model. The simulation provides the first guess of the state of the ocean at the next analysis time, while corrections are made to this first guess based on observations of variables such as temperature, salinity, or sea level. The third approach is 4D-Var, which in the implementation described uses the initial conditions and surface forcing as control variables to be modified in order to be consistent with the observations as well as a numerical representation of the equations of motion through iterative solution of a giant optimization problem. ==MethodologiesNo-model approach=== ISHII and LEVITUS begin with a first guess of the climatological monthly upper-ocean temperature based on climatologies produced by the NOAA National Oceanographic Data Center. The innovations are mapped onto the analysis levels. ISHII uses and alternative 3DVAR approach to do an objective mapping with a smaller decorrelation scale in midlatitudes (300 km) that elongates in the zonal direction by a factor of 3 at equatorial latitudes. LEVITUS begins similarly to ISHII, but uses the technique of Cressman and Barnes with a homogeneous scale of 555 km to objectively map the temperature innovation onto a uniform grid. ===Sequential approaches=== The sequential approaches can be further divided into those using Optimal Interpolation and its more sophisticated cousin the Kalman Filter, and those using 3D-Var. Among those mentioned above, INGV and SODA use versions of Optimal Interpolation. CERFACS, GODAS, and GFDL all use 3DVar. \\"To date we are unaware of any attempt to use Kalman Filter for multi-decadal ocean reanalyses.\\" The 4-Dimensional Local Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter (4D-LETKF) has been applied to the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory's (GFDL) Modular Ocean Model (MOM2) for a 7-year ocean reanalysis from January 1997 – 2004.Hunt, B.R., Kostelich E.J., Szunyogh, I. Efficient Data Assimilation for Spatiotemporal Chaos: A Local Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter. arXiv:physics/0511236 v1 28 Nov 2005. Dated May 24, 2006. ===Variational (4D-Var) approach=== One innovative attempt by GECCO has been made to apply 4D-Var to the decadal ocean estimation problem. This approach faces daunting computational challenges, but provides some interesting benefits including satisfying some conservation laws and the construction of the ocean model adjoint. ==See also== * Meteorological reanalysis ==ReferencesExternal links== * List of existing ocean syntheses at ICDC * SODA - Simple Oceanic Data Assimilation - Oceanographic Variables reanalysis dataset 1958-2001 * Historical Ocean Subsurface Temperature Analysis with Error Estimates Category:Oceanography ","title":"Ocean reanalysis"},{"id":"20512231","text":"Ataxocerithium huttoni is a species of medium-sized sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusc in the family Cerithiidae. ==References Further reading == * Powell A W B, William Collins Publishers Ltd, Auckland 1979 Category:Cerithiidae Category:Gastropods of New Zealand Category:Gastropods described in 1895 ","title":"Ataxocerithium huttoni"},{"id":"20512243","text":"The Deutscher Sportclub für Fußballstatistiken e.V., (English: German sports club for football statistics) short DSFS is an association dedicated to collecting and publishing German football statistics, similar to the RSSSF, and is a member of the German Olympic Society.

It was formed by six football enthusiasts after Helmut Druwen posted an add in the kicker sport magazine looking for people interested in football statistics. Having grown to a membership of 50, another add in the kicker in 1978 pushed the membership drive ahead and in 1979 the club finally became properly registered, joining the German Olympic Society as well.Epochen DSFS website, accessed: 2 December 2008 From 1980, the club started publishing brochures and a club magazine. But after 1983, the DSFS went into decline for the first time, recovering only in 1986 from several years of inactivity.

He soon began working for various textile firms, before founding Special Yarns Corporation in 1923 on $10,000 () in borrowed money, whose name he changed to Textron in 1944. Little spent much of his time acquiring other textile firms, and was successful in his efforts. By 1947, the company reported sales of $125 million (equivalent to $ billion in ). By the 1950s, realizing that the textile industry was not consistently viable, Little began to acquire firms in other industries, beginning the modern conglomerate.

Introduced on January 8, 2001, the character is the son of businessman Jack Abbott (Peter Bergman) and Diane Jenkins (Maura West). For the character's first three-year run, he was portrayed by a series of infant toddler actors. In 2010, the character returned, portrayed as slightly older by child actor Garrett Ryan. After two years, he was rapidly aged to an adult, with Blake Hood stepping into the role in April 2012. Upon his return, Kyle began dating Eden Baldwin (Jessica Heap). In March 2013, after a year in the role, Hood was let go and announced to be replaced by Hartley Sawyer. The soap opera had initially issued a casting call for a character named Connor Boyd, and due to his characteristics resembling that of Kyle, his casting was kept quiet. Hood stated that his ouster came as a shock to him. Sawyer made his debut on April 24, 2013. The character's six- year absence was criticized, and his age upon his 2010 return received unfavorable reviews. Hood was positively received in the role, and the decision to release him and replace him with Sawyer has also been criticized. Australian actor Lachlan Buchanan took claim of the role in 2015, making his first appearance on February 25 and departing on April 26, 2016. The role is presently portrayed by Michael Mealor, who made his first appearance as Kyle on March 29, 2018. ==Casting== Hartley Sawyer was cast in the role in 2013 before being let go nine months after his debut. The role was originally portrayed by two sets of twins, Connor and Garret Sullivan and Marissa and Madison Poer from 2001 to 2002, and twins Cooper and Oliver Guynes in 2002. Seth Stern portrayed the role in 2004. Following the character's return after a 6-year absence, the role was assumed by Garrett Ryan on February 25, 2010. He initially departed after two episodes, though returned as a recurring cast member eight months later on October 12, 2010. When asked at the 38th Daytime Emmy Awards if he was remaining with the series, Ryan replied: \\"Um, yes. I'm definitely sticking around on the show. I've been on a lot lately...\\" Ryan was last seen as Kyle on January 5, 2012. In March 2012, the character was rapidly aged, with Blake Hood cast to portray Kyle as an adult. He was previously known for his role of Mark Driscott on The CW's 90210. Hood debuted on April 27, 2012. Hood was surprised at how fast the process of soap operas where, and also credited Peter Bergman (who plays his on-screen father, Jack) as being very \\"gracious\\" and kind to him, lending experience. In March 2013, after a year in the role, Hood was let go and replaced with Hartley Sawyer. The soap opera had issued a casting call for a character named \\"Connor Boyd\\" in January and, due to the character sounding very much like Kyle, Sawyer's casting was kept quiet. Casting directors used a scene previously been performed by Noah Newman to recast the character. Hood stated his ouster and replacement came as a shock to him. Sawyer made his debut on April 24, 2013. In December, it was announced that Sawyer had been let go from the role eight months after a debut. He made his last appearance on January 27, 2014. In January 2015, it was announced that Australian actor Lachlan Buchanan had been cast in the role, and he debuted on February 25, 2015. In October, a representative for the soap opera confirmed that Buchanan had been dropped to a recurring status, but would continue to make appearances in the role. In March 2016, it was revealed that after months of being on recurring, Buchanan had been dismissed from the role; he last appeared on April 26, 2016. In January 2018, it was announced that The Young and the Restless was \\"actively\\" working to recast the role of Kyle. On March 1, 2018, it was announced that Michael Mealor had been cast in the role of Kyle. He made his first appearance on March 29, 2018, in celebration of the soap's 45th anniversary. == Character development == Ryan described as being a \\"little brat\\" but noted that it was \\"fun to play\\". Following Kyle being rapidly aged and returning to town, Hood stated that his new agenda was to \\"be close to his dad and move on with his life\\". However, Hood talked about how Kyle's goal to \\"live a happy full life\\" may not happen because he just happened to have \\"stepped into this situation where the woman who killed his mother is still here.\\" Kyle was \\"less than pleased\\" that his father Jack was re-developing a relationship with his ex-wife Nikki, who killed his mother in self-defense. Hood further said: \\"What’s great is that [Kyle’s] come back and [is] so much older now. It really feels like I can do whatever I want with the character ... [Kyle] hasn’t seen these people in 15 years or so.\\" == Storylines  2001–04 === Kyle was born with the name Christian Victor Newman on January 8, 2001. His mother Diane learned that her ex-husband, Victor Newman, had his sperm frozen, and when she obtained it she had herself artificially inseminated to carry Victor's child, and she later gave birth and told him he was the father. In reality, Diane's nemesis Nikki Newman had switched the sperm sample, and she was shocked to discover it was that of Jack. Soon after, she renamed the baby Kyle. Jack sued for sole custody of Kyle but lost, but once Diane burned down the Abbott poolhouse and tried to frame Jack's wife Phyllis Summers for it, he and Phyllis obtained custody of Kyle. However, Jack eventually gave Kyle back to Diane, and they moved to Chicago. === 2010–present === Six years later, as an arranged surprise for Jack from his new wife, Emily Peterson (Stacy Haiduk), Kyle, along with Diane, made a brief return to Genoa City to visit with Jack while Jack and Kyle became acquainted. Diane returned to town with Kyle again eight months later. Kyle resided in Genoa City, while both of his parents were being investigated by the SEC for plotting against Victor and making money off his stocks after making the world believe that he died. His mother sent him to boarding school in Switzerland without informing Jack because she was planning on faking her own murder and then joining her son. She also pleaded with Victor to sign the custody papers for Kyle if anything were to ever happen to her. It was unknown whether Diane was just following Adam Newman's (Michael Muhney) orders in her faked murder plot, or if she really did want Victor to have custody of Kyle over Jack. Then, Jack found out that Diane sent Kyle away the night that she was actually murdered. After Diane's death, Jack tracked Kyle down under his alias, Timothy Bilton, and went to Switzerland to bring his son home. Jack then had to tell Kyle that his mother was killed. While his father was under investigation, Kyle stole Jack's Harvard class ring that the police were looking for as evidence. He reasoned that he already had his mother taken away from him, and he wanted to keep his dad. Later, Victor showed Jack the custody papers that Diane made him sign, and Jack was infuriated at Victor and his deceased ex-wife for trying to take his son away from him. Jack vowed to fight to keep Kyle with his biological family. Kyle and Jack revealed to everyone that Kyle would be moving to New York to attend a hockey boarding school, and he left two weeks later. Kyle returns a grown adult for his new cousin's christening in April 2012. Upon seeing Nikki, the woman who killed Diane, and Jack together, he expresses his anger and distaste towards their relationship, claiming that they were bashing his mother's memory by being together. Afterward, Kyle went to Victor to ask if he could move in with him as Victor always said he was \\"welcome,\\" and takes a job at Newman Enterprises. He then began dating Eden Baldwin (Jessica Heap), and made friends with many pillars of the town. When Victor suddenly went missing and his wife Sharon Newman (Sharon Case) took over the ranch, Kyle eventually moved out after he could no longer deal with her. As a result of him insulting her, Sharon stole Kyle's driver's license as part of her kleptomania. Afterward, Jack told Kyle he was welcome to move back to the Abbott mansion, which he did. While working at Newman Enterprises, Kyle takes a liking to Phyllis and enlist her help in keeping an eye on Jack. When Kyle realizes that his father has been abusing his pain medications, he leaks the story to the press in an attempt to get Jack to realize he needs help. When Jack resigns as CEO of Newman Enterprises, he offers Kyle a job at Jabot Cosmetics, where he attracts the attention of young model Summer Newman (Hunter King). While initially dismissing her as too young, he later takes a liking to her and they begin a relationship. Summer's parents, Phyllis and Nicholas Newman (Joshua Morrow), secretly know that Summer is actually Jack's daughter, and Kyle is dating his half-sister. In an attempt to lure Kyle away from Summer, Phyllis kisses him and he ends their relationship. They briefly reunite before the truth about Summer's paternity is revealed, bringing their relationship to a permanent end. Kyle then continues working at Jabot alongside his father and later Hilary Curtis (Mishael Morgan) when Jack wants to find out what Victor is doing with Newman Enterprises' merger with Chancellor Industries. In order to do so, Jack enlists Kyle to ask Victor to rehire him at his company so he can get information on Bonaventure Industries, one of the company's subsidiaries. While working there, Kyle clashes with Noah Newman (Robert Adamson), who eventually reports him to Victor and he is fired. Soon after, it is said that Kyle was sent to work for Jabot in New York. In February 2015, Kyle (Lachlan Buchanan) returns to Genoa City, when he is recused and believed to be missing resident Austin Travers (Matthew Atkinson). == Reception == In 2009, Jamey Giddens of Zap2it wrote that Zack Conroy would fit well as a teenaged version of the character, saying he \\"would kill to see Conroy create the role of a teenage Kyle Abbott on The Young and the Restless\\". He also criticized Kyle's absence over the years and predicted his return to the soap opera, writing: \\"Imagine Kyle Abbott arriving in Genoa City with a massive chip on his shoulder. Maybe he could seduce that annoying Eden away from Noah, or get involved in a steamy affair with a woman twice his age, like Lauren Fenmore (the woefully-underutilized Tracey Bregman)?\\" Jillian Bowe (also of Zap2it) criticized Ryan's introduction and the character's return in 2010, writing: \\"Sound the alarm and blow the trumpets. After years of begging and pleading with the regime over at The Young and the Restless to bring back Jack Abbott's (Peter Bergman) sons, one of them finally appears—sort of. Since Diane (now played by 30-something Maura West) returned, Y&R; has all but beat fans over the head in reminding us of how Kyle was conceived, all the while neglecting to explain why Abby—who was conceived at the very same time as her cousin—is now decades older than him. What gives? De-SORASing the long- anticipated character of Kyle Abbott is a huge no-no and gigantic re-write of history. Good, bad or sticky, Y&R; fans will always remember that two babies came from Kay Alden's wacky, sperm caper. My vote is Y&R; needs to age Kyle appropriately before fans decide to flush this story (if not Jack and Victor's swimmers) down the drain.\\" Tommy Garrett of the website Highlight Hollywood wrote that Hood's performance was \\"sensational\\" and found him \\"very handsome\\"; though was unfavorable of his successor, Sawyer, writing: \\"Hartley Sawyer, who with all due respect, is not attractive and actually very boring in the role.\\" Soap Opera Digest described the decision to \\"dump the charming Blake Hood\\" and recast the character with Sawyer as \\"puzzling\\". ==References== Category:The Young and the Restless characters Category:Fictional business executives Category:Television characters introduced in 2010 Category:American male characters in television ","title":"Kyle Abbott (The Young and the Restless)"},{"id":"20512288","text":"Jarmo is a two-player abstract strategy board game. According to Tartarian and Polish legend, Batu Khan, the grandson of Genghis Khan, carried this game (or a variant of it) around during his military campaigns. Supposedly, he would play at least one game before a battle in order to prepare himself. In this game, a player attempts to place as many of their pieces onto the other player's first row. At the same time, the player tries to capture as many of the other player's pieces on the way. A Jarmo variant called Jasir is played in parts of Poland, and in some eastern European countries. In fact, several variants of Jarmo and Jasir exist, but they are all fundamentally similar. Jasir means \\"archer\\" in Tartar, and the pieces used in the game are called archers. The games are sometimes collectively referred to as Halma. However, Jarmo and Jasir are not related to the Halma family of games which include Halma, Chinese Checkers, Conspirateurs, Ugolki, and Salta. An interesting aspect of Jarmo and Jasir is that the board is asymmetric. Each player has a different view of the game from their side of the board. The lines connecting the holes are not the same for each side of the board. To make the game more fair, it is suggested that players play two games and switch sides in between. As a note, most board games have a symmetric board. == Goal == The player with the most points wins. Two points are awarded for every archer that makes it to the other player's first row. One point is awarded for every archer remaining on the rest of the board. If both players have the same number of points, then the game is a draw. == Equipment == Jarmo's board is a 5x5 hole board with several lines connecting each of the holes. Please refer to the diagram in the external links. Each player has five pieces called \\"archers\\". One player plays the black archers, and the other player plays the white archers. == Gameplay == # The players first decide who will play the black archers, and who will play the white archers. They also decide who will start first. # The players then place their five archers on the row nearest them which is also called the first row (or first rank). # An archer may move along a marked line onto a hole. If the hole is occupied by an enemy archer, the enemy archer is removed from the board (the enemy archer may be played back into the game at a later time under certain circumstances - please refer to rule 7). The player's archer is then marked with a white or black line. If that same archer captures another enemy archer no additional markings are added. Captures are not compulsory. # No more than one archer can occupy any one hole at a time. Only one archer may be moved on a player's turn. Players alternate their turns in this game. # Unlike Jasir, the archers in Jarmo can move forward, backward, laterally on any marked line. In Jasir, archers cannot move backwards. # Archers that make it to the other player's first row can no longer move backward to re-enter the rest of the board behind them. They must stay there for the remainder of the game unless they are captured by an enemy archer that moves backwards onto it. # As mentioned earlier, a marked archer is one that has captured at least one enemy archer. When a marked archer reaches the enemy's first row, they allow for the player to take back one of their captured pieces from the enemy player, and place it on any available hole on the player's first row. If no holes are available on that turn, then the player must wait to place it on their next opportunity. # The game ends when any one player has brought all of their remaining archers on the board onto the enemy player's first row. The first player to do so will count two points for every archer on the enemy player's first row. The other player also counts two points for every archer on the enemy player's first row, but only one point for every archer remaining on the rest of the board. The player with the most points wins. # Due to the asymmetry of the board game, it is suggested that a second game be played with players switching sides. Points are then added together from the two games, and the winner is the player with the most points. # In order to avoid some unnecessary draws, a player cannot move an archer back and forth between two holes in four consecutive turns. == Related Games == Jasir == External links == * http://brainking.com/en/GameRules?tp=52 * https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl;=it&u;=http://www.pergioco.net/Giochi/GiochiDiTavoliere/Jasir/Jasir.htm&sa;=X&oi;=translate&resnum;=1&ct;=result&prev;=/search%3Fq%3Djasir%2Bpergioco%26hl%3Den Category:Abstract strategy games ","title":"Jarmo (game)"},{"id":"20512292","text":"Shelby Chong (née Fiddis; born February 1, 1948) is an American comedian, actress and producer who was the executive producer of Best Buds (2003) and the associate producer of four Cheech & Chong films.

The group was founded in September, 1998 by Hanna Schwartz, a then- sophomore in Rutgers College and Jordan Ullman, a then-graduate student at the Rutgers University Graduate School of Education. It was the first co-ed A Cappella group on campus and since its inception, has been entirely student- run. The group travels across the eastern seaboard, and has participated in the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella several times, making it to the finals twice and picking up several awards along the way. They recently celebrated their 16th Anniversary Season. == Current members == *Soprano **Kathryna Caparino '20 **Emma Leary '22 **Francesca Tangreti '22 (Social Media Manager) **Neha Shah '23 *Alto **Gabriela Abarquez '21 **Stephanie Man '21 **Nneka Okoye '23 *Tenor **Mason Satnick '20 **Michael Lazarow '22 (Music Director) **Aditya Nibhanupudi '22 (Assistant Music Director) **Dalen Saltzman '22 (Assistant Business Manager) *Bass **Harrison Zhang '22 (Treasurer) **Sebastian Recto '22 (Business Manager) **Andrew Shen '22 (Communications Officer) **Sameer Madhukar '23 == History  Conception and early beginnings (1998-2001) === In 1998, Deep Treble was founded as the first secular a cappella group at Rutgers. The 2000-2001 school year was a big one for Deep Treble. December's concert in Trayes Hall proved the biggest yet, with over 350 music lovers showing up. In January, Deep Treble began work on its first album, \\"All Kinds of Treble,\\" set to be released in the Fall of 2001. April marked the first time Deep Treble performed in Nicholas Music Center at the Mason Gross School of the Arts. 2000-2001 was also the first year Deep Treble was accepted into the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella (ICCAs). After placing second in the Northeast Quarterfinals at Tufts University in Boston, Deep Treble won the Northeast Semifinals at the University of Connecticut in Storrs, Connecticut. This win sent Deep Treble to Avery Fischer Hall in Lincoln Center in New York City for the International Finals. Along the way, Deep Treble picked up many awards, including two to Jordan Ullman for his arrangements, a vocal percussion award to Brian Chambers, a vocal percussion award to Jeremy Schafer, and best vocalist awards for the sisters Rabie and Rachel Wohl. In the Fall of 2001 Deep Treble released its self-produced debut album, \\"All Kinds of Treble.\\" In the Spring of 2002, Deep Treble took first place in the ICCA Mid-Atlantic Quarterfinals. Brian Chambers picked up an arrangement award for \\"Regulate/I Keep Forgettin',\\" while Minna Urrey won the Outstanding Soloist Award for \\"Jersey Girl.\\" At the Semifinals, Deep Treble took third place and multi-talented Brian took home the award for best percussionist. === Another go at international acclaim (2007-present) === After a few years off the competition circuit, Deep Treble decided to compete again in the ICCAs in 2007. Under the musical direction of Viraj Lal, DT placed second in the Mid Atlantic Regional at Drexel winning the award for Best Choreography. Rutgers hosted the Semifinals and won first place, in addition to a Best Soloist Award for Yaa Acheampong’s rendition of “Janie’s Got a Gun” and Best Vocal Percussion by Jessica Totaro. This win marked the second time Deep Treble reached a berth at the Finals in Lincoln Center. DT starred in a television segment on NJN for its tremendous success. That summer, Deep Treble recorded its third album. Take the Cake, launched in Spring 2008 with a huge Cake-celebration, earned accolades, rave reviews, and proved to be the most successful album for the group yet. On December 13, 2008, Deep Treble celebrated its 10th anniversary in style. First, there was a reunion providing a great chance for current members to connect with alumni and a great opportunity for alumni to reconnect with old friends. At the reunion, the Deep Trebles of past and present relived old songs under the guidance and leadership of the original arrangers, past musical directors, and many of the original soloists. Subsequently, the 10th Anniversary Concert featured the alumni clad in black with a splash of red singing “Beautiful,” “Janie’s Got a Gun,” with Candice Helfand, “Let Go,” with Melanie Kim, “Under the Bridge,” with Kenny Karnas, “Always Be My Baby,” with Gia Wright, “The Whole World Together,” with Jason Troost, Matt LaFargue, Uton Onyejekwe, and Travis Nilan, and “The Remedy,” featuring Travis Nilan. The alumni even sang a song by themselves: “If You Could Only See” with Uton Onyejekwe. As a result of the event, Deep Treble established the position of Historian to maintain contact with the alumni and to preserve documentation of the concerts. The competition season of Spring 2009 proved to be one of Deep Treble’s hardest and triumphant. The competition set included two new songs, and DT’s membership included seven new members. Under the musical direction of Julia Fendler, DT overcame these difficult odds and placed second in the Mid Atlantic Quarterfinals at RPI, picking up an award for Best Arrangement by Alexandra Bancroft for her mash-up, “Unapologize.” Rutgers, once again, hosted Semifinals, and Christofer Peckhardt earned the award for Best Soloist of “Beautiful Child.” In 2011 and 2012, Deep Treble returned to the ICCAs and although they did make it to the Semi-Finals, they took home Best Soloist awards both years for \\"Rock Medley\\" Arranged by Galdriel Sevener '12 and sung by Tyler Picone '14, and a return of \\"Beautiful Child\\" arranged by Kenneth Feibush and also sung by Tyler Picone. The group also took home the award for best vocal percussion in 2011 awarded to Charles Salamone '12. In May 2013, Deep Treble celebrated their 15th anniversary in style where it all began, at Kirkpatrick Chapel where the first Deep Treble concert was performed. The group had a small get together beforehand to meet and socialize with alumni and performed several songs with alumni such as: \\"All These Things\\" \\"The Remedy\\" \\"Your Ex-Lover is Dead\\" \\"The Sign\\" and Unfaithful Apology\\". In such a short time, Deep Treble has established solid reputation at Rutgers and in the a cappella world. DT frequently performs at benefits, concerts, and events around campus and elsewhere. Its alumni have gone on to become lawyers, doctors, professional musicians and arrangers, and teachers, and still have time to appear at concerts to join for the encore. While the future is unknown, the prospects look bright with new members, invigorating songs, victorious competitions, and rocking albums. == Awards == *ICCA 2001 Northeast Quarterfinals: 2nd Place *ICCA 2001 Northeast Semifinals: 1st Place *ICCA 2001 Finals: 4th Place **Outstanding Solo: Rebecca and Rachel Wohl **Outstanding Arrangement: \\"Sweet Child of Mine\\" **Outstanding Vocal Percussion: Jeremy Schafer *ICCA 2002 Mid-Atlantic Quarterfinals: 1st Place **Outstanding Arrangement: \\"Regulate/I Keep Forgettin'\\" **Outstanding Solo: Minna Urrey: \\"Jersey Girl\\" *ICCA 2002 Mid-Atlantic Semifinals: 3rd Place **Outstanding Vocal Percussion: Brian Chambers *ICCA 2004 Mid-Atlantic Quarterfinals: 3rd Place **Best Choreo *ICCA 2007 Mid-Atlantic Quarterfinals: 2nd Place **Outstanding Choreography *ICCA 2007 Mid-Atlantic Semifinals: 1st Place **Best Soloist: Yaa Acheampong for \\"Janie's Got A Gun\\" **Outstanding Vocal Percussion: Jessica Totaro *ICCA 2009 Mid-Atlantic Quarterfinals: 2nd Place **Outstanding Arrangement: Alexandra Bancroft *ICCA 2009 Mid-Atlantic Semifinals **Outstanding Soloist: Christofer Peckhardt for \\"Beautiful Child\\" *ICCA 2011 Mid-Atlantic Quarterfinals **Outstanding Soloist: Tyler Picone for \\"Rock Medley\\" **Outstanding Vocal Percussion: Charles Salamone *ICCA 2012 Mid- Atlantic Quarterfinals **Outstanding Soloist: Tyler Picone for \\"Beautiful Child\\" == Discography == *2001- \\"All Kinds of Treble\\" *2006- \\"Hooked\\" *2008- \\"Take The Cake\\" *2012- \\"Rock This Way\\" *2016- \\"41 Jones\\" *2018- \\"Grown The Spring EP\\" ==References External links == *Varsity Vocals Results Page *Deep Treble Official Website Category:Musical groups established in 1998 Category:Rutgers University Category:Collegiate a cappella groups ","title":"Deep Treble"},{"id":"20512325","text":"Bop-Be is the final album on the Impulse label by jazz pianist Keith Jarrett's 'American Quartet'.

It was recorded in October 1976 in two sessions that also helped produce the album Bop-Be. Released on the Impulse label in 1977, it features performances by Jarrett, Dewey Redman, Charlie Haden, and Paul Motian. Musically speaking, even though the album Eyes of the Heart made it last to the market, Byablue and Bop-Be document the swan song of Jarrett's American Quartet in several ways, but most of all the inclusion of compositions by members other than Jarrett himself deliver another taste. While that did not happen before, for what would be the quartet's final recording sessions, Jarrett requested that band members contribute with their own compositions. Byablue consisted primarily of Paul Motian's pieces, while Bop-Be included Redman and Haden's contributions. ==Background: disbanding the American Quartet== As Neil Tesser details on his 1996 extensive notes found in the compilation album Mysteries: The Impulse Years 1975-1976 (which contains all the tracks recorded in that period, including alternate takes) the following was the story of Jarrett's American Quartet last \\"marathon recording sessions\\" taking place from December 1975 to October 1976: ==Byablue and Bop- Be: the last sessions== Having conversed with Keith Jarrett, on the text found in Mysteries: The Impulse Years 1975-1976 Neil Tesser transcribes a few Jarrett's reflections regarding the inclusion of musical material authored by Redman, Haden and Motian: Tesser ends up assuming that after Byablue and Bop- Be, artistically and musically the group had already given its best: \\"Interesting as this experiment proved, it did not convince Jarrett that his most pessimistic assessments were misplaced. The music failed to kick-start the band into a higher orbit.\\" ==Reception== The Allmusic review by Richard S. Ginell awarded the album 4 stars, stating, \\"The band certainly doesn't sound as if it was ready to break up; the interplay is telepathic, the musical ideas are still fresh, and there is a willingness to experiment.

It continued until 1962 as the HK500. ==HistoryFV=== Rear view of early FV The Facel 'Vega' was launched at the 1954 Paris Salon. By 1956 the cars were called FVS (for Facel Vega Sport), earlier cars often being referred to as simply \\"FV\\". The 1954 versions of the Facel were fitted with a DeSoto Firedome (Chrysler) 4.5 litre Hemi V8 engine, paired with either Chrysler's two-speed Powerflite automatic transmission or, at extra cost, a four-speed manual made by Pont-à-Mousson. At this stage, the FV was capable of a top speed from , depending on which rear axle ratio was installed. The chassis, designed by Lance Macklin, was tubular framed, featuring coil springs and double wishbones at the front, with a leaf-sprung live rear axle. The styling, by Daninos himself, was somewhat American and perhaps a bit heavy, with rudimentary tail fins. The body was an expanded version of the earlier, Facel- bodied Simca/Ford Comète. An abundance of stainless steel brightwork was fitted. The interior was uncommonly luxurious, and of exceptional workmanship. The dashboard was aircraft-inspired, and one of the first to feature a middle console over the gearbox. The rear seats folded flat to provide a luggage platform and additional access to the boot. In 1955 the engine capacity increased to 4.8 litres and (FV1), which later in the year grew to (FV2). 47 of these early FVs were built in 1954 and 1955. Six were convertibles, but as these suffered from rigidity troubles the rest of the large two-door Facels were pillarless coupés. ===FVS=== Early Facel Vega FVS (1956 FV2B), combining the first front design with panoramic windshield The 1956 FVS featured a panoramic (aka wrap-around) windshield. Sometimes referred to as FV2, the car featured the same engine as in the later FV1s. Subsequently the 5.4-litre FV2B appeared, with . Later versions offered a three-speed automatic, and disc brakes were available from 1958. At some point a reworked, more harmonious front end was introduced, featuring what looked like twin stacked headlights but what were actually headlamps on top and auxiliaries beneath. Power steering and power brakes were both standard as of 1957. For 1958, the engine grew to 5.8 litres (FV4) and , although the earlier 4.5 and a 4.9 (FV3/FV3B) were also listed as available. In total, 357 FVs and FVSs were built. A four- door version, called the Excellence, was added to the lineup in 1958, but was even more rarefied than the two-door version. ===HK500=== Facel Vega HK500 For 1959, the Facel Vega HK500 was introduced. Essentially, it was just a renamed, upgraded FVS. Equipped at first with the 5.8-litre V8 from the FVS, the HK500 soon received a 6.3 litre Chrysler V8, giving it a top speed of 147 mph (237 km/h). It could accelerate from 0-60 mph (97 km/h) in 8.5 seconds. Initially, disc brakes were optional, becoming standard in April, 1960. The Facel Vega II replaced the HK500 in 1962, after 489 had been built. One was a specially made convertible. Total FV/HK production was 842, or 846 depending on the source. French publisher Michel Gallimard was driving his HK500 on January 4, 1960, when he lost control and crashed outside of Villeblevin. The crash killed him and one of his passengers, Nobel laureate Albert Camus. Some have speculated that the driver was not familiar with the car's handling and weight, and that contributed to the severity of the crash. {  style=\\"text- align:center; font-size:100%; float:right;\\" - !colspan=2 width=\\"300\\" ProductionFrom and .

His victories at Bắc Ninh (March 1884) and Hưng Hóa brought to an end the two-year undeclared war in northern Vietnam between France and China, and paved the way for the conclusion of the Tientsin Accord between the two countries on 11 May 1884. Millot resigned as general-in-chief of the Tonkin Expeditionary Corps shortly after the outbreak of the Sino- French War on 23 August 1884 and returned to France. == Command of Tonkin Expeditionary Corps == In early 1884 the arrival of substantial reinforcements from France and the African colonies raised the strength of the expeditionary corps to over 10,000 men. Its new commander, général de division Charles- Théodore Millot (1829–1889), organised this force into two brigades. The 1st Brigade was commanded by général de brigade Louis Brière de l'Isle (1827–1896), who had earlier made his reputation as governor of Senegal. The 2nd Brigade was commanded by général de brigade François de Négrier (1842–1913), a charismatic young Foreign Legion commander who had recently quelled a serious Arab rebellion in Algeria. General Millot and his staff, summer 1884. The charismatic young general François de Négrier is sitting second to Millot's right Millot commanded the expeditionary corps for eight months, from February to September 1884. During his tenure of command he organised two major campaigns to capture Bắc Ninh and Hưng Hóa (March and April 1884) and two more modest expeditions to capture Thái Nguyên and Tuyên Quang (May and June 1884). In the Bắc Ninh campaign he won a spectacular walkover victory against Xu Yanxu's Guangxi Army. At the Capture of Hưng Hóa, he flanked Liu Yongfu out of a formidable defensive system without losing a man. Having argued strenuously against sending a column to occupy Lạng Sơn in the heat of the Tonkin summer, he emerged unscathed from the official enquiry into the circumstances of the Bắc Lệ ambush (June 1884). Millot was arguably the most successful of the many commanders of the expeditionary corps, but he was unpopular with both his officers and his men, who considered him overcautious. Significantly, his decision to halt General de Négrier's pursuit of the defeated Chinese forces in the Bắc Ninh campaign was held against him, even though he had sound military reasons for this decision. The troops immediately gave sardonic Vietnamese nicknames to their three generals. The much-admired de Négrier became Maolen ('Quick!'), Brière de l'Isle Mann Mann ('Slow!'), and Millot Toi Toi ('Stop!'). Millot's career in Tonkin ended on a sour note. In poor health, and dismayed at the way the French government used the Bắc Lệ ambush as a pretext for war with China, he submitted his resignation in September 1884. In his last order of the day, he described himself as 'a sick and disappointed man'.Thomazi, Conquête, 233–4 ==NotesReferences== * Huard, La guerre du Tonkin (Paris, 1887) * Huguet, L., En colonne: souvenirs de l'Extrême-Orient (Paris, 1888) * Lung Chang [龍章], Yueh- nan yu Chung-fa chan-cheng [越南與中法戰爭, Vietnam and the Sino-French War] (Taipei, 1993) * Thomazi, A., Histoire militaire de l'Indochine française (Hanoi, 1931) * Thomazi, A., La conquête de l'Indochine (Paris, 1934) Category:1829 births Category:1889 deaths Category:French military personnel of the Franco-Prussian War Category:People of the Tonkin campaign Category:French generals ","title":"Charles-Théodore Millot"},{"id":"20512820","text":"The color magenta has notable tints and shades. These various colors are shown below. ==Definition of magenta== Illustration of Magenta on the CIE 1931 color space chart. Magenta is a color made up of equal parts of red and blue light. This would be the precise definition of the color as defined for computer display (the color #FF00FF shown in the color swatch above). It is a pure chroma on the RGB color wheel (Image of RGB color wheel:) midway between purple and rose. In HSV color space, magenta has a hue of 300°. Magenta is not a spectral but an extraspectral color: it cannot be generated by light of a single wavelength. Humans, being trichromats, can only see as far as 380 nanometers into the spectrum, i.e., as far as violet. The hue magenta is the complement of green: magenta pigments absorb green light, thus magenta and green are opposite colors. ==Three major historical variations of magentaMagenta dye (original variation) (1860)=== Before printer's magenta was invented in the 1890s for CMYK printing, and electric magenta was invented in the 1980s for computer displays, these two artificially engineered colors were preceded by the color displayed at right, which is the color originally called magenta made from coal tar dyes in the year 1859.Maerz and Paul A Dictionary of Color New York:1930 McGraw-Hill Page 126 Plate 52 Color Sample K12--Magenta (Color shown is color shown above as rich magenta) Besides being called original magenta, magenta dye color is also called rich magenta to distinguish it from the colors printer's magenta and electric magenta, shown below. Magenta was one of the first aniline dyes, discovered shortly after the Battle of Magenta (1859), which occurred near the town of Magenta in northern Italy. The color was originally called fuchsine or roseine, but for marketing purposes in 1860 the color name was changed to magenta after the battle. Hence, the color is named indirectly after the town. ===Process magenta (pigment magenta) (printer's magenta) (1890s)=== Cyan, magenta and yellow are the three subtractive primary colors used in printing. In color printing, the color called process magenta or pigment magenta is one of the three primary pigment colors which, along with yellow and cyan, constitute the three subtractive primary colors of pigment. (The secondary colors of pigment are blue, green, and red.) As such, the CMYK printing process was invented in the 1890s, when newspapers began to publish color comic strips. Process magenta is not an RGB color, and there is no fixed conversion from CMYK primaries to RGB. Different formulations are used for printer's ink, so there can be variations in the printed color that is pure magenta ink. A typical formulation of process magenta is shown in the color box at right. The source of the color shown at right is the color magenta that is shown in the diagram located at the bottom of the following website offering tintbooks for CMYK printing: . ===Web colors magenta and fuchsia (1990s)=== Red, green and blue lights, representing the three basic additive primary colors of the RGB color system, red, green, and blue. Magenta light is composed of equal amounts of red and blue light. Magenta, shown at the right, is one of the three secondary colors in the RGB color model, used to make all the colors on computer and television displays. It is made by a mixture of red and blue light at equal intensity. It is called magenta on X11 list of color names, and fuchsia on the HTML color list. The web colors magenta and fuchsia are exactly the same color. Sometimes the web color magenta is called electric magenta or electronic magenta. ==Additional variations of magentaAmaranth=== Amaranth (color) is a reddish-rose color that is a representation of the color of the flower of the amaranth plant. Globe amaranth The color amaranth purple is displayed at right. ===Magenta (Crayola)=== At right is displayed a Crayola color formulated in 1949; it was originally called brilliant rose but the name was changed in 1958 to magenta. This color has a hue angle of 329, which is close to the hue angle of the color rose, which is 330. ===Shocking pink (Crayola)=== Displayed at right is the Crayola color shocking pink. This is a Crayola crayon color formulated in 1972 and called ultra pink. In 1990 the name was changed to shocking pink. ===Razzle dazzle rose=== Displayed at right is the color razzle dazzle rose. This color is a vivid tone of rose tending toward magenta. This is a Crayola crayon color formulated in 1972 and called hot magenta. In 1990 the name changed to razzle dazzle rose. ===Hot magenta=== Displayed at right is the color hot magenta. This color was formulated by Crayola in 1986. ===Purple pizzazz=== Displayed at right is the color purple pizzazz. This color was formulated by Crayola in 1990. ===Shocking pink=== Shocking pink (the original 1937 shocking pink) takes its name from the tone of pink used in the lettering on the box of the perfume called Shocking, designed by Leonor Fini for the Surrealist fashion designer Elsa Schiaparelli in 1937. ===Orchid=== The color orchid, since it has a hue code of 302, may be classified as a rich tone of magenta. Orchid is a representation of the color of the orchidaceae flower.

It is characterized by its small size, low-slung semi-circular mouth, and regularly placed dark fin rays. A common and widespread species, it is native to sandy bottoms in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. It is of little commercial value. ==Distribution and habitat== The solenette occurs in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean from Iceland and Scotland southward, as well as in the North Sea, Kattegat and the Baltic Sea. It also occurs in the Mediterranean Sea, including the Adriatic Sea, the Sea of Marmara, and the Bosphorus. It has been reported from a range of , but is rare in very shallow waters. The highest abundances occur at depths of in the English Channel and at in the Bay of Biscay. Their distribution is not restricted by sediment type as in some other flatfish species. In the Solway Firth, there is a general movement offshore in the winter. This species has more specific habitat requirements than other widespread Atlantic flatfish such as the European plaice, common sole, and common dab. It is concentrated in waters moderately influenced by estuary outflows, at a salinity of 29-33 ppt, and is absent from the mouths of the largest estuaries where the salinity is lower. The solenette is often found on or half-buried in muddy or muddy-sandy substrates. ==Description== The smallest of the soles in European waters, the solenette usually measures long and attains a maximum length of . It has an oval, compressed, slightly elongate body with both eyes on the right side of the head. The snout is rounded with the upper jaw slightly elongated to form a \\"beak\\". The diameter of the upper eye is less than the distance between it and the front of the head. The dorsal fin begins on the anterior profile of the head, with 65-78 fin rays. The anal fin contains 49-63 fin rays, and the caudal fin is connected to the dorsal and anal fins by a small membrane. The pectoral fin on the eyed side is small, with 3-5 fin rays, and the one on the blind side is reduced to 1 long and 1-2 short fin rays. The lateral line scales number 55-70, and are rectangular in shape with short, strongly curved intercanalicular striae. The coloration of the eyed side is variable, frequently yellowish or light brown with or without darker blotches or spots. The dorsal and anal fins are sandy with every 5th or 6th (occasionally 4th or 7th) fin ray dark for the majority of their lengths. The solenette can change its color to better match its background.Ruiz, A. (2007). Buglossidium luteum. Solenette. Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom. Retrieved on December 2, 2008. ==Biology and ecology== Adult solenette feed on a variety of small benthic organisms, mainly crustaceans (copepods, amphipods, and cumaceans), bivalve molluscs, and polychaete worms. The diet of the solenette varies by geographical region; solenette from the English Channel feed on a larger variety of prey than those from the Bay of Biscay, and take proportionally more polychaetes as opposed to crustaceans and molluscs for the Bay of Biscay. Feeding activity peaks in summer and declines markedly in winter. The solenette spawns in February in the Mediterranean, from March to June in the Bay of Biscay, and in July and August in the western English Channel, North Sea, and western Ireland. The eggs are small and distinguishable from those of other soles by having only a few large oil globules. The larvae hatch at about 2 mm long, with metamorphosis beginning at about 7 mm long and being complete at 8–9 mm. In appearance the larvae are similar to those of the common sole, but with fewer large stellate chromatophores. There is also a distinct patch of pigment on the ventral abdominal wall, and the distinct shape of the head is also apparent in the early stages. In the North Sea, there are no special nursery areas, with juveniles and adults occurring in the same areas. The young take up a benthic lifestyle at 12 mm long. Most growth occurs in the first year of life and continues at a relatively low and constant rate afterwards. Both sexes mature in their third year, with males growing faster than females and females attaining a larger ultimate size. The maximum reported age is 13 years. ==Relationship to humans== The solenette is too small to be of commercial interest and is usually discarded by fishers. It is caught as bycatch in trawls, sometimes in large numbers, and historically has often been confused with the young of the common sole. Between 1985 and 2006, the range of the solenette increased significantly in the North Sea, which is believed to be a consequence of rising sea bottom temperatures. ==References== Category:Soleidae Category:Fish of Europe Category:Fish of the Mediterranean Sea Category:Fish described in 1810 ","title":"Solenette"},{"id":"20512904","text":"The Greater Brisbane League or formerly the Greater Brisbane Baseball Board league (GB3) is the largest baseball league in the Australian state of Queensland and covers all teams from Brisbane North, South, West, Metro as well as two Gold Coast teams. These are from age groups Little League (U12) through to seniors. It is run by the governing body of Baseball Queensland.Baseball Queensland To participate in the Greater Brisbane Major League, clubs must meet certain criteria set by Baseball Queensland. Generally the hardest criteria for clubs to meet is to field a team in the junior age levels U14's, U16's and U20's. When this criterion is not met, senior teams may only compete in the South Queensland Baseball League or Pacific League competition. The GBL consists of six senior division teams from Major/Pacific League A and B through to South Queensland League A-C and a separate Masters competition. Juniors consist of an U20 competition, division one and two U16 and a division one and two U14 competitions. U8, U10 and U12 competitions are run by their respective regions and are non-divisional.Baseball Queensland Competitions ==History== The Greater Brisbane League was originally known as the Queensland Baseball Association fixtures, which began in 1946 when six teams entered the competition playing primarily at New Farm Park, Kalinga Park, Langlands Park, Perry Park and the Brisbane Exhibition Ground. Uniforms were made out of surplus army uniforms and teams made up of many American ex- pat soldiers from World War II and A-Grade cricketers to keep game fit during the off-season.Harris, J.O (2009).

In neurophysiology, a dendritic spike refers to an action potential generated in the dendrite of a neuron. Dendrites are branched extensions of a neuron. They receive electrical signals emitted from projecting neurons and transfer these signals to the cell body, or soma. Dendritic signaling has traditionally been viewed as a passive mode of electrical signaling. Unlike its axon counterpart which can generate signals through action potentials, dendrites were believed to only have the ability to propagate electrical signals by physical means: changes in conductance, length, cross sectional area, etc. However, the existence of dendritic spikes was proposed and demonstrated by W. Alden Spencer, Eric Kandel, Rodolfo Llinás and coworkers in the 1960s and a large body of evidence now makes it clear that dendrites are active neuronal structures. Dendrites contain voltage-gated ion channels giving them the ability to generate action potentials. Dendritic spikes have been recorded in numerous types of neurons in the brain and are thought to have great implications in neuronal communication, memory, and learning. They are one of the major factors in long-term potentiation. A dendritic spike is initiated in the same manner as that of an axonal action potential. Depolarization of the dendritic membrane causes sodium and potassium voltage-gated ion channels to open. The influx of sodium ions causes an increase in voltage. If the voltage increases past a certain threshold, the sodium current activates other voltage-gated sodium channels transmitting a current along the dendrite. Dendritic spikes can be generated through both sodium and calcium voltage- gated channels. Dendritic spikes usually transmit signals at a much slower rate than axonal action potentials.Kampa BM, Letzkus JJ, Stuart GJ. 2007. Dendritic mechanisms controlling spike-timing-dependent synaptic plasticity. Trends in Neurosciences 30:456-63 Local voltage thresholds for dendritic spike initiation are usually higher than that of action potential initiation in the axon; therefore, spike initiation usually requires a strong input.Häusser M, Spruston N, Stuart GJ. 2000. Diversity and dynamics of dendritic signaling. Science 290:739-744 ==Voltage-Gated ChannelsVoltage-Gated Sodium Channel=== Diagram of a voltage-sensitive sodium channel α-subunit. G - glycosylation, P - phosphorylation, S - ion selectivity, I - inactivation, positive (+) charges in S4 are important for transmembrane voltage sensing. Voltage-gated sodium channels are proteins found in the membrane of neurons. When electrically activated, they allow the movement of sodium ions across a plasma membrane. These channels are responsible for propagation of electrical signals in nerve cells. Voltage- gated sodium channels can be divided into two subunits: alpha and beta. A variety of alpha subunit voltage-gated sodium channels have been identified. Voltage-gated sodium channels found in mammals can be divided into three types: Nav1.x, Nav2.x, and Nav3.x. Nav1.x sodium channels are associated with the central nervous system. Nav1.1, Nav2.2, and Nav1.6 are three isoforms of the voltage-gated sodium channels that are present at high levels in the central nervous system of an adult rat brain.Goldin AL. 1999. Diversity of mammalian voltage-gated sodium channels. Annals New York Academy of Sciences 868:38-50 These channels have been well documented in the axonal membrane of the central nervous system. Nav1.2 has been primarily identified in unmyelinated axons while high concentrations of Nav1.6 have been observed at nodes of Ranvier of axons.Caldwell JH, Schaller KL, Lasher RS, et al. 2000. Sodium channel Nav1.6 is localized at nodes of ranvier, dendrites, and synapses. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 97.10:5616-5620 Nav1.6 has been identified in the dendrites of hippocampal CA1 neurons that generate dendritic spikes; the density of Nav1.6 in these neurons is 35-80 times lower than in the initial segments of axons. Distribution of voltage- gated sodium channels along the dendritic membrane plays a crucial role in a dendrites ability to propagate a signal. High dendritic membrane thresholds often make it harder for initiation of dendritic spikes. However, increased density of voltage-gated sodium channels may reduce the amplitude of a signal needed to initiate a spike. Clustering of voltage-gated sodium channels have been observed at the synapses of the globus pallidus neuron.Hanson JE, Smith Y, Jaeger D. 2004. Sodium channels and dendritic spike initiation at excitatory synapses in globus pallidus neurons. Journal of Neuroscience 24:329-40 It has also been demonstrated through dendritic computational models that the threshold amplitude of a synaptic conductance needed to generate a dendritic spike is significantly less if the voltage-gated sodium channels are clustered at the synapse. The same type of voltage-gated channels may differ in distribution between the soma and dendrite within the same neuron. There seems to be no general pattern of distribution for voltage-gated channels within dendrites. Different neuronal dendrites exhibit different density patterns which are subject to change during development and can be modulated by neurotransmitters. ===Voltage-Gated Calcium Channel=== Like voltage-gated sodium channels, voltage-gated calcium channels are also integral membrane proteins found in the plasma membrane. Voltage-gated calcium channels generate action potentials by the same mechanisms as voltage-gated sodium channels. Various voltage-gated calcium channels have been identified in neurons. N- and P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channels are the primary subtypes found to support synaptic transmission.Dolphin AC. 2006. A Short history of voltage- gated calcium channels. British Journal of Pharmacology 147:S56-S62 These channels are concentrated at nerve terminals. T-type and R-type voltage-gated calcium channels have been found in basal dendrites, and it is thought that the activation of these channels during action potential bursts lead to the generation of dendritic calcium spikes.Kampa BM, Letzkus JJ, Stuart GJ. 2006. Requirement of dendritic calcium spikes for induction of spike-timing- dependent synaptic plasticity. Journal of Physiology 574.1:283-290 T-type and R-type channels are all part of the alpha 1 subunit class of calcium channels. The various types of voltage-gated calcium channels result in two forms of voltage activation: low-voltage-activated (LVA) and high-voltage-activated (HVA) calcium currents. In deep cerebellar nuclei, calcium currents are not uniformly distributed along a dendrite.Gauck V, Thomann M, Jaeger D, et al. 2001. Spatial distribution of low- and high-voltage-activated calcium currents in neurons of the deep cerebellar nuclei. Journal of Neuroscience 21:1-4 The relative strength of LVA calcium currents are significantly more concentrated at the distal end of dendrites. The uneven distribution of LVA calcium currents suggests the important role of LVA calcium currents in dendritic integration at synaptic inputs. ===Voltage-Gated Potassium Channel=== Potassium channel KcsA. Voltage-gated potassium channels are another set of voltage-gated channels that play a significant role in the initiation of dendritic spikes. Voltage-gated potassium channels, similar to voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels, facilitate the movement of cations across the plasma membrane. But unlike voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels, the voltage-gated potassium channel moves cations out of the cell thereby having an inhibitory effect on dendritic spike initiation. The transient A-type voltage-gated potassium channel is a specific channel that plays a key role in dendritic spike initiation. The density of voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels is similar in both dendrites and axons; however, the dendritic membrane is far less excitable than the axonal membrane.Hoffman DA, Magee JC, Colbert CM, et al. K+ channel regulation of signal propagation in dendrites of hippocampal pyramidal neuron. Nature 387:869-875 The difference in excitability can be attributed to the presence of these voltage-gated potassium channels. Voltage-gated potassium channels inhibit the ability of dendrites to generate action potentials and decrease the amplitude of dendritic spikes with increasing distance from the soma. The ability of voltage-gated potassium channels to modulate dendritic signaling may have significant effects on synaptic plasticity. ==Spike InitiationAction Potential=== Action potentials initiated in the axon normally travel down the axon away from the soma. However, it is also possible for an action potential to travel in the opposite direction, invade the soma, and then travel down the dendrite as a dendritic spike.Ma J, Lowe G. 2004. Action potential backpropagation and multiglomerular signaling in the rat vomeronasal system. Journal of Neuroscience 24(42):9341-9352 This retrograde signal provides information to the synapse that the neuron has fired an output. The efficacy of the signal varies among different neuronal types. For example, backward propagation of action potentials is very limited in cerebellar Purkinje cellsLlinas R, Sugimori M. 1980. Electrophysiological properties of in vitro purkinje cell dendrites in mammalian cerebellar slices. Journal of Physiology 305:197-213 but is quite prevalent in interneurons of the medium ganglionic layer of the cerebellum-like lobe of some fish.Gomez L, Kanneworff M, Budelli R, Grant K. 2005. Dendritic spike back propagation in the electrosensory lobe of Gnathonemus petersii. Journal of Experimental Biology 208:141-55 ===Synaptic Input=== Action potentials may be first generated at the dendrite if stimulated by strong synchronous synaptic inputs.Golding NL, Spruston N. 1998. Dendritic sodium spikes are variable triggers of axonal action potentials in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. Neuron 21:1189-1200 The ability of a dendrite to initiate an action potential is not only highly dependent on synaptic input but also on the number of voltage-gated channels and density of voltage-gated channels present in the membrane. ===Spatial Summation=== Hippocampal Pyramidal Cell Initiation of a dendritic spike through a single strong synaptic input does not guarantee that the spike will propagate reliably over long distances.Jarsky T, Roxin A, Kath WL, Spruston N. 2005. Conditional dendritic spike propagation following distal synaptic activation of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. Nature Neuroscience 8:1667-76 If multiple synapses are simultaneously activated, dendritic spikes may be formed through spatial summation. Spatial summation involves the addition of multiple input signals resulting in a larger signal and possibly a dendritic spike. Hippocampal CA1 neurons have been shown to produce reliable dendritic spike propagation through spatial summation of multiple synaptic inputs. In the hippocampus, the CA1 neurons contain two distinctive regions that receive excitatory synaptic inputs: the perforant path (PP) through the apical dendritic tuft (500-750 μm from soma) and the Schaffer-collateral (SC) through the basal and apical dendrites (250-500 μm from soma). Studies show that individual stimulation of either the PP or SC was not sufficient enough to allow a dendritic spike to initiate an action potential. However, it was shown that when a dendritic spike occurred due to PP stimulations, the presence of a SC stimulation determined whether or not the signal would propagate to the soma. ==Spike PropagationBackward Propagation=== Dendritic spikes most commonly propagate backwards from the soma to distal dendritic branches. Backward propagation serves a number of functions in the neuron, and these functions vary based on the type of neuron. In general, backwards propagation serves to communicate output information to the post synaptic membrane. In many neurotransmitter releasing neurons, backward propagation of dendritic spikes signals the release of neurotransmitters.Chen WR, Shen GY, Shepherd G, et al. 2002. Multiple modes of action potential initiation and propagation in mitral cell primary dendrite. Journal of Neurophysiology 88:2755-2764 For example, Mitral cells seem to serve both as projection neurons and as local interneurons. If the axonal output of mitral cell is shut down by somatic inhibition, local dendritic action potentials cause the mitral cell to release neurotransmitters into the environment. Backward propagation of dendritic spikes has been demonstrated in various neuronal types in the brain but has rarely been studied outside of the brain. Other than neurons in the brain, dendritic spikes have been observed in the neurons of the spinal cord. ===Forward Propagation=== Forward propagation of dendritic spikes initiate due to synaptic activity, and serves to amplify signals that may not reach the soma through passive transmission. The strength of synaptic stimulation required to generate a dendritic spike varies among neuronal types. Neurons which receive relatively few inputs cannot rely on spatial summation and therefore must rely on stronger synaptic inputs. Some relatively unbranched neurons, such as the globus pallidus neuron, bypass the need of strong synaptic input by increased concentrations of voltage-gated sodium channels at the synapse. Other more branched neurons, such as pyramidal neurons, rely on spatial summation of multiple inputs to generate forward propagating dendritic spikes. Forward propagation is not well understood and much research is devoted to the subject. It is thought by most experts that this phenomenon does not occur in neurons outside of the brain. ==Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity== Schematic of a chemical synapse between an axon of one neuron and a dendrite of another. Spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) refers to the functional changes in a neuron and its synapse due to time dependent action potentials. When an action potential reaches the pre-synaptic membrane it opens voltage-gated calcium channels causing an influx of calcium. The influx of calcium releases vesicles filled with neurotransmitters, usually glutamate, into the synaptic cleft. The neurotransmitters bind to receptors on the post- synaptic membrane opening ligand-gated channels causing the membrane to depolarize. NMDA receptors are found throughout the post-synaptic membrane and act as a coincidence detector. The NMDA detects both glutamate released by pre-synaptic vesicles and depolarization of the post-synaptic membrane. The NMDA receptor exhibits voltage-dependent block by magnesium ions. Depolarization of the post-synaptic membrane (i.e. backward propagating dendritic spike) causes the magnesium ion to be removed from the channel, favoring channel opening. NMDA receptor activation thereby allows calcium influx. Neurons that “fire together wire together” refer to strengthening of synaptic connections through NMDA receptors when glutamate release is coincident with post-synaptic depolarization. This form of wiring is known as long term potentiation. Synaptic connection can also be weakened when the activity of neurons is uncorrelated, also known as long term depression. The dependence of post-synaptic depolarization in STDP indicates the importance of dendritic spikes. In general, post-synaptic depolarization occurs coincidentally with pre-synaptic activity when a backwards propagating signal reaches the post-synaptic membrane. Dendritic spikes allow backward propagating signals to reach and depolarize the post-synaptic membrane. The strengthening and weakening of synaptic connections is one proposed method of memory formation and learning. ==Experimental Methods Two-Photon Glutamate Uncaging === Two-photon glutamate uncaging, a type of photostimulation, has become the premier tool for studying dendritic spikes due to its high level of precision. ===Patch Clamp=== The cell-attached patch clamp uses a micropipette attached to the cell membrane to allow recording from a single ion channel. Patch clamp recording is used to measure electrical activity in neurons. The technique uses a one micrometer diameter open tip glass micropipette to suction the membrane of a cell. The pipette is filled with ionic solution, and a silver wire is placed in the solution to conduct and amplify electrical signals. The ion solution can be varied and drugs can be delivered through the micropipette to study the effects of current under various conditions. Receptor and voltage-gated channel antagonists are often applied (i.e. nickel used to block NMDA receptors) in order to study the effects of ion channels on dendritic spike initiation. Current injection is often paired with patch clamp recordings in order to observe current modulation due to various experimental factors. ===Extracellular Electrophysiology=== Tetrode recording methods have also been shown to occasionally allow for observation of dendritic membrane potentials and dendritic action potentials. Interestingly, the chronic recording paradigm that demonstrated this also showed that dendritic voltage properties exhibited egocentric spatial maps comparable to pyramidal neurons. This rare phenomenon may be due to a glial sheath forming around the tetrode tips, creating a high impedance sea, similar to a gigaohm seal in patch recordings, that allows for such small and localized voltage measurement to be made. ===Staining and Labeling=== Staining and labeling techniques are often used in microscopy to help identify specific structures in a cell. Staining usually involves the use of dyes that are absorbed by various cell structures at different rates. Labeling involves the use of fluorescence to identify specific molecules. Fluorophores, fluorescent molecules, may be directly attached or attached to an antibody in order to detect a specific target. In the case of dendritic spikes, staining and labeling are used to identify and quantify the presence of certain voltage-gated channels. For example, rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against synthetic peptide sequences have been used to identify the presence of Nav1.2, Nav1.3, and Nav1.6 sodium channels in dendrites of the globus pallidus neuron. ===Computational Modeling=== Computational modeling of neurons, artificial neural networking, has become a very popular tool in investigating the properties of neuronal signaling. These models are based on biological neural networks. Computational modeling can be used to study single neurons, groups of neurons, or even networks of neurons. This field has generated much interest and serves as a tool for all branches of neuroscience research including dendritic spike initiation. ==References== Category:Neurophysiology ","title":"Dendritic spike"},{"id":"20512947","text":"Kenneth, Kenny, or Ken Smith may refer to: ==SportsFootballers=== *Ken Smith (footballer, born 1927), English footballer who played as an inside forward *Ken Smith (footballer, born 1932) (1932–2011), English footballer who played as a centre forward *Kenny Smith (AFL player) in 2007 Austin Wranglers season ===Ice hockey=== *Kenny Smith (ice hockey) (1924–2000), ice hockey player ===Racing=== *Ken Smith (racing driver) (born 1942), New Zealand motor racing driver *Ken Smith (racer) in New England Auto Racers Hall of Fame *Ken Smith (speedway rider) from Grasstrack ===American football=== *Kenny Smith (American football) (born 1977), American football player *Ken Smith (American football), played in List of Boston College Eagles starting quarterbacks ===Baseball=== *Kenneth Smith (baseball), played Baseball at the 1956 Summer Olympics *Ken Smith (baseball) (born 1958), former Major League Baseball player ===Basketball=== *Speedy Smith (born 1993), American college basketball player for the Louisiana Tech Bulldogs *Ken Smith (basketball, born 1953), American professional basketball player for the San Antonio Spurs *Ken Smith (basketball, born 1954), American college basketball coach for the Northern Colorado Bears *Kenny Smith (born 1965), American basketball player and announcer ===Other sports=== *Ken Smith (rugby union) (born 1931), Scottish international rugby player *Kenneth Smith (cricketer) (1922–1998), English cricketer *Ken Smith (sportswriter), American sportswriter *Kenneth Smith (sailor), competed in 1960 Star World Championships *Kenneth Smith (swimmer), competed in 2006 FINA World Open Water Swimming Championships – Men's 10K ==Politicians== *Ken Smith (Australian politician) (born 1944), Australian member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly *Ken Smith (American politician) (born 1926), American former politician in the state of Florida *Kenneth J.

A Negau helmet from the Hallstatt period (Early Bronze Age) was discovered in Nevlje in 1928. Kužna Hill is located above the village. Its name probably means the place where people with the plague were living. In 1563, an infectious disease hospital operated in Nevlje. ==Archaeological site== In March and April 1938, an almost complete skeleton of a 40-year-old woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius), an antler of a reindeer (Rangifer tarandus), an atlas of a polar fox (Alopex lagopus), and a small Paleolithic tool made of almost black flint were found in Nevlje by workers who built a bridge across the Nevljica and deepened its bed. It was the first discovered Paleolithic hunting settlement in the territory of the present Slovenia and was dated to around 20,000 BP, the time of the Gravettian culture in the latter half of the Würm period (the last glaciation period). The excavations attracted domestic and international public attention, researchers, and politicians. A bridge built at this spot was named the Mammoth Bridge (). A pollen analysis was performed at the site for the first time by Ana Tregubov-Budnar, the first Slovenian palinologist. In 1944, she attributed the pollen to the end of an interglacial period. Later, it was shown by Alojz Šercelj that it actually belongs to the Würm glaciation. The mammoth skeleton is one of the best preserved in Europe and has become the symbol of the Natural History Museum of Slovenia, where it is now on display. ==Church== Saint George's Church Saint George's Parish Church is located in Nevlje and is the oldest in the region.

As abbot and resident teacher, Ryushin oversaw the training and operations of the Monastery, working closely with Geoffrey Shugen Arnold, Roshi, who is the head of the Mountains and Rivers Order. Ryushin came to the dharma through Vipassana meditation, eventually shifting to Zen practice and taking Daido Roshi as his teacher. Prior to ordination, Ryushin was a pediatrician and a psychiatrist.

She is the author of multiple books of poetry, including monkeypuzzle, forage, and undercurrent. Her work investigates the relationships between social justice, ecology, decolonization, and contemporary poetics. Wong is an associate professor at the Emily Carr University of Art and Design, teaching Critical and Cultural Studies. She has another course in development, Cultivating Ecological, Cross-Cultural, and Interdisciplinary Contemplations of Water. She has also been a visiting instructor at the University of Miami. ==Education== Wong graduated with a BA (Hons) in 1990 from the University of Calgary. She received master's degrees in 1992 from the University of Alberta and in 1996 from the University of British Columbia. In 2003 she received her PhD from Simon Fraser University. ==Published worksmonkeypuzzle=== Wong's first poetry collection, monkeypuzzle, was published by Press Gang in 1998. Reviewer Sook C. Kong in Herizons called it \\"a huge achievement.\\" Mark Libin for Canadian Literature agreed that the collection \\"does indeed, as the book jacket declares, announce a promising new voice in Canadian literature.\\" Wong's poems in the volume address her identity as a bisexual Asian woman. ===forage=== forage, a second collection, was published in 2007; it explores how ecological crises relate to the injustices of the international political landscape. In Wong's words, \\"the next shift may be the biggest one yet, the union of the living, from mosquito to manatee to mom.\\" Aaron Giovannone in Canadian Literature called the book \\"a dynamic mixture of styles .... [that] coheres because of the author's voice, which is emboldened by a sense of sheer affront and the need to find \\"ground to push against, red earth, / bloody earth, stolen earth.\\"\\" The book won the 2008 Dorothy Livesay Prize.Forage at Harbour Publishing ==Wong and the environment== Wong's poetry often addresses her relationship with her environment. Her poems show a close connection with nature and a support for local product, while expressing distaste for genetically modified foods. In forage, her poem 'the girl who ate rice almost every day' encourages the reader to look up Monsanto in the US patent database, and see how many patents there are for genetically modified foods, including the type of foods affected. There is also a poem, 'canola queasy' dedicated to Percy Schmeiser, the Saskatchewan farmer sued by Monsanto because he intentionally propagated genetically engineered canola that had blown into his fields. Her work challenges the reader to think about how they affect their environment. For instance, in 'sort by day burn by night' Wong brings attention to Guiyu village, a small village in China whose main profit comes from disassembling circuit boards, usually with a sharp rock because they cannot afford a hammer. When asked about her own computer use Wong notes, \\"as someone who relies heavily on computers, I am implicated in the degradation and eventual destruction of ecosystems (mining for coltan)\\", but writes to try to \\"reconcile [her] intent (to work toward peace and social justice) with [her] consumption patterns as a citizen in North America\\".Rita Wong interview at 12 or 20 questions ==Bibliography Books authored=== *beholden: a poem as long as the river.

Contemporary English usage typically uses Mazepa for the historical personage and maintains Mazeppa for historical depictions such as Byron's poem. The poem intertwines a love plot between Mazepa and Maria with an account of Mazepa's betrayal of Tsar Peter I and Peter's victory in battle. Although often considered one of Pushkin's lesser works and critiqued as unabashedly imperialistic, a number of critics have praised the poem for its depth of characterization and its ability to synthesize disparate genres. The poem inspired Tchaikovsky's 1884 opera Mazeppa. ==Outline of the poem== The poem opens with an epigraph from Byron's 1819 Mazeppa, which depicts the Hetman as a Romantic hero, exiled from Poland for conducting a love affair with a married noblewoman. Pushkin follows this epigraph with a passionate dedication to an anonymous loved one. The first edition carried a foreword [предисловие] in which Puskhin objects to the heroic presentation of Ivan Mazepa in works by other writers and his intention to correct them by depicting him as he actually was.Pushkin states \\"some writers wanted to make him [Mazepa] a hero of liberty... no-one has depicted him as an old coward who turned pale at the sight of an armed woman... it would be better to set out and explain the true character of the rebellious hetman and not distort his true historical personage. [Некоторые писатели хотели сделать из него героя свободы, нового Богдана Хмельницкого.... Некто в романической повести2) изобразил Мазепу старым трусом, бледнеющим пред вооруженной женщиною, . Лучше было бы развить и объяснить настоящий характер мятежного гетмана, не искажая своевольно исторического лица.] Pushkin, 31 January 1829, \\"Predislovie k Poltave\\", cited in Sobranie sochinenii A.S. Pushkina v desiati tomakh, ed. S. M. Bondi. Moscow. Available online at http://www.rvb.ru/pushkin/02comm/0791.htm. The poem itself is divided into three parts – or \\"songs\\" [песни] – of roughly equal length. Part I opens by setting the scene in the estate of the nobleman Vasily Kochubei, and describing the beauty of his daughter Maria. Maria has fallen in love with the Hetman Mazepa, who is her godfather and much older than she is: therefore they keep their love secret. However, they are quickly discovered, and are forced to elope, which brings shame on the family and leaves their parents scared. The narrative then switches to a description of the political trouble in Ukraine: there is a significant support for a break with Russia; Mazepa is supporting the rebels. Kochubei vows to take revenge upon Mazepa for breaking the bond of trust between them and eloping with Maria. He has remained loyal to the Tsar and sends a messenger to denounce the Hetman to the Tsar. Most of Part II is written as a dramatic dialogue in the tradition of closet drama. Mazepa is focused on his plans to rebel against the Tsar, and Maria is worried that he no longer loves her. He asks her to promise that she would always choose him over her father, but declines to tell her of his betrayal of the Tsar. Meanwhile, Kochubei has been captured by the rebels and he is tortured and interrogated by Orlik. The rebels demand to know where he has hidden his money but he declines to reply. Maria's mother comes to find her and help her save her father; but they arrive too late: Kochubei has already been executed. Mazepa is tormented on discovering Maria's disappearance and sets out to look for her. Part III switches back to a single third-person narrator. Mazepa pretends that his physical health is failing, so that to lull tsar's vigilance, while King Charles XII of Sweden is preparing for battle against Peter I. Peter I and his cavalry arrive and defeat the Swedish army and the Ukrainian rebels. Mazepa does little fighting and flees the battlefield as fast as he can. He finds he can no longer sleep and sees Maria again. This time it's clear that she has lost her mind (she couldn't get through her father's execution). In a memorable passage, Maria no longer recognizes him, because she sees him for what he truly is: a ridiculous and horrible old man. The poem closes with a reflection by the narrator after one hundred years, claiming that while Mazepa is now forgotten, Peter I, the hero of the battle, has created an enormous monument for himself. The narrator tells us that he does not know the fate of Maria. ==Historical Sources and Inspiration== Ivan Mazepa, Vasily Kochubei, and Kochubei's daughter Maria (Motrya) are historical figures.The historical information here is based on that given in Babinski, H. F. (1974). The Mazeppa legend in European Romanticism. New York, Columbia University Press. pp. 75-82 According to historians, it is true that Mazepa had a romantic interest in Maria and she went to live in his home, but whether they were involved in a relationship is unclear. In reality, Mazepa and Maria did not elope: Kochubei removed her from Mazepa's home and sent her to a convent. It is true that Kochubei denounced Mazepa to Peter in 1706 for conspiring against him with Charles XII of Sweden, but it is unclear if Kochubei had evidence of this alleged conspiracy. However, in 1708 Charles and Mazepa did sign a secret treaty, and they did fight against Peter I in the battle of Poltava. As Pushkin's Foreword makes clear, he had read a number of sympathetic treatments of Ivan Mazepa and was seeking to respond to them. He was responding both to Byron's Mazeppa and to a poem Voinarovskii by the Russian Decembrist poet Kondraty Ryleyev which praises Mazepa.For a detailed account of how Pushkin's work engages with Ryleev's, see Babinski, Chapter 5. ==Analysis== This poem has received considerably less attention than Pushkin's other narrative poems, and its reception has been mixed.For a good overview of responses, see Burns 2005, p. 13 A.D.P. Briggs sees Pushkin's fusion genres and subject matter as unsuccessful, calls it overly-long - at nearly 1500 lines it is one of the longest of Pushkin's narrative poems - and protests the lack of variety in rhyme.See the entry by Briggs on \\"Pushkin\\" in the 1998 The Reference Guide to Russian Literature, ed. Neil Cornwell. London: Fitzroy Dearborn. Also his 1982 study, Alexander Pushkin: A Critical Study Duckworth: London, pp. 92 - 94. Babinski also makes the charge that the disparate elements in the poem are not well-integrated, suggesting the poem is \\"not a continuous narrative... barely a narrative poem at all, more like a three-act play with an all-purpose narrator to keep the material together.\\"Babinski, p. 133 Several critics have made the charge that Poltava is an apology for Russian Imperialism. J.P. Pauls (1962) accuses Pushkin of \\"propagating the Russian imperialistic cause\\" and \\"distorting\\" historical truth.J.P. Pauls (1962), Puskhin's' 'Poltava. New York, Shevchenko Scientific Society, p. 30 This view is echoed by Svetlana Evdokimova (1999), who contrasts what she sees as unabashed patriotism of Poltava with the richer, more ambiguous portrayal of Peter I and Empire in The Bronze Horseman (1833).Evdokimova, Svetlana. Pushkin's Historical Imagination New Haven, Yale University Press (see Chapter 6) Pushkin's biographer Henri Troyat suggested that Pushkin deliberately wrote a pro-Imperial poem in order to assuage Tsar Nicholas I, who was suspicious of his political loyalties after his return from exile.Troyat is cited in Babinski, p. 110 Soviet critics tended to be more sympathetic towards the poem. V.M. Zhirmunskii (1924) sees the poem as the moment of Pushkin's decisive break with Byron, arguing that Pushkin uses a moral and historical perspective to create psychological portraits and evaluations of his characters, while Byron relies on emotion alone.Zhirmunskii, V.M. (1924) Bairon i Pushkin Leningrad, Nauka. pp. 200-2016 S.M. Bondi argues that Pushkin successfully pulls together historical and personal themes and the poem is a valuable meditation on the place of the Russian state among European powers.Bondi, S.M. (ed).

Kommentarii k poeme Poltave Available online at http://www.rvb.ru/pushkin/02comm/0791.htm However, while Pushkin certainly made the claim that he was writing a historically-accurate poem, Babinski points out \\"for all his insistence upon historicity, Pushkin slanted the facts.\\"Babinski, p. 122 Western critics who have been kinder to Poltava have focused on its characterization. John Bayley says that Mazepa \\"has something of the depth of a Shakespeare portrait\\".Bayley, John. (1971) Pushkin: A Comparative Commentary. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. p. 120-22 David Bethea also suggests that Poltava owes something to Shakespearean characterization.Bethea, D. (2001) \\"Pushkin and Shakespeare\\" in The Routledge Companion to Russian Literature ed. Neil Cornwell. London: Routledge. The most sympathetic treatment of the poem is offered in a book-length treatment by Virginia Burns (2005), which praises the poem for its successful characterization, tight structure and the scope of its philosophical inquiry.Burns, Virginia M.

In his art, he frequently portrayed the lives of the Norwegian people, their history and heroes of the past. Bergslien is most associated with his historical paintings, especially Skiing Birchlegs Crossing the Mountain with the Royal Child. ==Background== Knud Larsen Bergslien was born in Voss, in Hordaland, Norway. His parents were Lars Bergeson Bergslien and Kirsten Knutsdotter Gjelle. Knud Bergslien was the brother of sculptor Brynjulf Bergslien and uncle of painter and sculptor Nils Bergslien. Monuments honoring the three famous Bergslien artists now exist in Bergslien park located in Voss, Hordaland. ==Career== Skiing Birchlegs Crossing the Mountain with the Royal Child. Painting located at the Holmenkollen Ski Museum, Oslo, Norway. Knud Bergslien enlisted in the army when he was 18 years old, but his unusual gift for drawing was soon noticed. After having been a student at the artist Hans Reusch's school of drawing in Bergen, he continued his studies abroad. Bergslien studied in Antwerpen from 1844 to 1852, in Paris from 1850 to 1851 and Düsseldorf from 1855 to 1869. He belonged to the Düsseldorf school of painting and was closely associated with follow artists Hans Fredrik Gude and Adolph Tidemand. Norwegian artist Johan Fredrik Eckersberg had established an art school on Lille Grensen in Christiania (now Oslo) in 1859. After his death in 1870, the school would be continued by Knud Bergslien together with Morten Müller. Knud Bergslien served as the director of what became the Bergslien School of Painting (Bergsliens Malerskole). A whole generation of Norwegian painters became his students, among them Harriet Backer, Edvard Munch, and Ragnvald Hjerlow. Some of his students emigrated to America including the Norwegian-American artists, Lars Jonson Haukaness, Carl L. Boeckmann and Herbjørn Gausta. Today, Bergslien is most associated with his historical paintings, especially Skiing Birchlegs Crossing the Mountain with the Royal Child (Norwegian: Birkebeinerne på Ski over Fjeldet med Kongsbarnet). His depiction of Birkebeiner skiers carrying Prince Haakon to safety during the winter of 1206 has become a national Norwegian icon. The prince grew up to be King Haakon IV whose reign marked the end of the period known as the Civil war era in Norway. Bergslien was honored by the Oscar II, King of Sweden and Norway with the Order of Vasa, an esteemed order of Knighthood, for his 1875 painting titled The Crowning of King Oscar II in the Nidaros Cathedral (Norwegian: Kong Oscar II's kroning i Nidarosdomen).

He belonged to a Maharaja Zamindar family of the Ujjainiya clan of the Parmar Rajputs of Jagdispur, currently a part of Bhojpur district, Bihar, India. At the age of 80, he led a select band of armed soldiers against the troops under the command of the British East India Company. He was the chief organiser of the fight against the British in Bihar. He is popularly known as Veer Kunwar Singh. ==Early life== Kunwar Singh was born on 13 November 1777 to Maharaja Shahabzada Singh and Maharani Panchratan Devi, in Jagdispur of the Shahabad (now Bhojpur) District, in the state of Bihar. He belonged to the Ujjainiya Rajput clan. A British judicial officer offered a description of Kunwar Singh and described him as \\"a tall man, about six feet in height\\". He went on to describe him as having a broad face with an aquiline nose. In terms of his hobbies, British officials describe him as being a keen huntsman who also enjoyed horse-riding. After his father's death in 1826, Kunwar Singh became the taluqdar of Jagdispur. His brothers also inherited some villages however a dispute arose as to their exact allocation. This dispute was eventually settled and the brothers seemingly returned to having cordial relations. He married the daughter of Raja Fateh Naraiyan Singh, a wealthy zamindar of the Deo-Munga estate in Gaya district who belonged to the Sisodia clan of Rajputs.Kalikinkar Datta, Biography of Kunwar Singh and Amar Singh, K.P.

Kunwar Singh and his attendants Singh led the Indian Rebellion of 1857 in Bihar. He was nearly eighty and in failing health when he was called upon to take up arms. He was assisted by both his brother, Babu Amar Singh and his commander-in-chief, Hare Krishna Singh. Some argue that the latter was the real reason behind Kunwar Singh's initial military success. He gave a good fight and harried British forces for nearly a year and remained invincible until the end. He was an expert in the art of guerilla warfare. His tactics left the British puzzled. Singh assumed command of the soldiers who had revolted at Danapur on 25 July. Two days later he occupied Arrah, the district headquarters. Major Vincent Eyre relieved the town on 3 August, defeated Singh's force and destroyed Jagdishpur. During the rebellion, his army had to cross the Ganges river. Douglas' army began to shoot at their boat. One of the bullets shattered Singh's left wrist. Singh felt that his hand had become useless and that there was the additional risk of infection due to the bullet-shot. He drew his sword and cut off his left hand near the elbow and offered it to the Ganges.History of Bhojpur . Bhojpur.bih.nic.in. Retrieved on 2011-10-12. Singh left his ancestral village and reached Lucknow in December 1857 where he met with other rebel leaders. In March 1858 he occupied Azamgarh and managed to repel the initial British attempts to take the area. However, he had to leave the place soon. Pursued by Brigadier Douglas, he retreated towards his home in Ara, Bihar. On 23 April, Singh had a victory near Jagdispur over the force led by Captain le Grand (le gard in Hindi). On 26 April 1858 he died in his village. The mantle of the old chief now fell on his brother Amar Singh II who, despite heavy odds, continued the struggle and for a considerable time, running a parallel government in the district of Shahabad. In October 1859, Amar Singh II joined the rebel leaders in the Nepal Terai. ==Death== In his last battle, fought on 23 April 1858, near Jagdispur, the troops under the control of the East India Company were completely routed. On 22 and 23 April, being injured he fought bravely against the British Army and with the help of his army drove away the British Army, brought down the Union Jack from Jagdishpur Fort and hoisted his flag. He returned to his palace on 23 April 1858 and soon died on 26 April 1858. ==Legacy== To honour his contribution to India's freedom movement, the Republic of India issued a commemorative stampStamp at Indiapost.

The park was also officially renamed as 'Veer Kunwar Singh Azadi Park'. He is mentioned in many Bhojpuri folk songs as a hero who fought against British oppression. One particular folk song states: In the 1970s, a private landlord militia known as the 'Kuer Sena/Kunwar Sena' (Kunwar's Army) was formed by Rajput youth in Bihar to combat naxalite insurgents.

It is compatible with Nokia's N-Gage platform, being the only touchscreen to do so. ==Reception== The N97 Common criticisms of the original N97 were the relative lack of RAM and available storage. With only around 50 MB of free RAM available after boot, the phone can become sluggish and close programs in order to conserve memory. Many first party applications also will only install on the root partition and with around 50 MB of free space, this is used quickly as it is also where temporary OS files are placed. This issue was resolved in the N97 mini as the user often has over 250 MB of free space on the fixed storage. A memory mapping alteration from firmware version 20 allowed applications to use less RAM and free it up better, helping to ease the strain of a lower amount of free RAM to the end-user.How To Recover Phone Memory On Your Nokia N97  The Handheld Blog.

These phones too easily lose track of the current location, making the free turn by turn navigation software provided by Nokia unusable. Users can have both the lens cover and GPS issues fixed under warranty at an official Nokia service centre.

The term OMO is now generally used to support a campaign, often led by the pensions industry and the media, to make sure people know the benefits of shopping around. The majority of people still don’t use the Open Market Option in large part because they don’t know they can or don’t realise the benefits of doing so. Retirees who don’t use the OMO and settle for the default deal offered by their pension provider, may be missing out on up to 20%http://www.theopenmarketannuityteam.co.uk/pension-annuities- guidebook/pension-annuities-guidebook.html more income from an annuity. This is especially important as retirees cannot change their annuity once it has been purchased. One of the main reasons that people can get more from an annuity if they shop around is that they may qualify for what is known as an Enhanced Annuity (sometimes known as an Impaired Life Annuity) which pays a higher income to people who suffer from a range of health conditions – anything from asthma to a serious heart condition. There are also other products available that may suit people’s retirement needs better than the default deal offered by a pension provider. One suggestion to make the most of the Open Market Option is to speak to an independent financial adviser who will explain the different options available at retirement. The Association of British Insurers has been working with the retirement industry to improve consumers' knowledge of the Open Market Option. This includes pensions providers making it much clearer to their customers that they can use the OMO and that they may get a better income by doing so. However, take up of the Open Market Option is still low and there are now calls from many to make it harder for a pension scheme to transfer into an annuity by default, thereby forcing people to consider their options. ==External links== * http://dfs- marketing.com http://myretirementsaving.com Category:Pensions in the United Kingdom ","title":"Open Market Option"},{"id":"20513455","text":"Maurice Chevit (31 October 1923 - 2 July 2012) was a French actor.

Although Taiwanese singer Jay Chou started the evening with six nominations, he did not win in any of the categories. During the presentation for the award of Best Male Mandarin Artist, Hong Kong actress Karen Mok could be heard announcing the winner as \\"Wang Lixing\\", combining the Chinese names for Leehom Wang () and Stanley Huang (). This mistake resulted in a confusion where Wang took the stage to receive the award without realizing that Mok had made the mistake. The actual award was meant for Huang, who was a relative newcomer compared to the more popular Wang. The mistake was partially blamed on Mok's Cantonese language background, which pronounces the two characters for \\"Wang\\" () and \\"Huang\\" () as \\"Wong\\" with the same tone. The second character in both artist's names also had the same tone in Mandarin, complicating the process because the third part of the name was nearly drowned out by the audience. Wang won the award the following year at the 17th Golden Melody Awards. ===Special segments=== Leehom Wang and Jay Chou were interviewed and asked to comment on each other. Chou also performed a medley piano battle with Nan Quan Mama group member Yuhao Zhan. The medley included segments from Prelude and Fugue No. 2 in C minor in Book 1 of Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier, a capriccio of Chou's song \\"Reverse Scales\\" (), and the theme song of Super Mario Bros. ==External links== * 16th Golden Melody Awards nominees * 16th Golden Melody Awards winners ==References== Golden Melody Awards Category:Golden Melody Awards Category:2005 music awards ","title":"16th Golden Melody Awards"},{"id":"20513540","text":"The Aegean Center for the Fine Arts was founded in 1966 by Brett Taylor, and has been overseen by its director, John Pack, since 1984.

His first team debut came on 11 August 1998 when he was a late substitute for Jon Coates in the 1–1 draw at home to Norwich City in the League Cup. His league debut came four days later in the 2–1 defeat away to Cambridge United, this time as a second-half substitute for Ryan Casey. With Swansea in the midst of a financial crisis, Roberts spent part of the 2001 pre-season on trial with Rotherham United and moved to Wycombe Wanderers in October 2001 for a fee of £100,000. He remained with Wycombe until February 2004 when he returned to Swansea, initially on loan, but a month later on a free transfer.

It includes over five hundred works by artists of international renown and is now considered to be one of the largest and most significant collections of contemporary art by women in the world. Paintings, prints, and sculpture are displayed throughout Murray Edwards College in Cambridge. The College has no designated gallery and the works are displayed throughout its buildings and grounds. The modernist College buildings were completed in 1965 by Chamberlain, Powell and Bon and are Grade II* listed. The Collection has come about as the result of many gifts and loans from artists and donors. The Collection started in 1986 with the purchase of Mary Kelly's \\"Extase\\" (thanks to the generous support of the Eastern Arts Association and the artist herself) following her stay as artist in residence. This spurred the hope that the College might develop a permanent collection of 20th-century art by women, to inspire the female students who would live among it. In 1992, Dr Valerie Pearl (President 1981-1995) wrote to 100 of the leading women artists in Britain and received some 75 donations in return.\\"What's the point of a museum of art by women?\\" The Guardian (London). 28 July 2008.

The aim is to have the commented code at the developer's disposal at any time it might be needed. This is especially useful when the requirements change rapidly. In this case, they happen to revert to older versions of themselves, thus making the programmer either write the code again, or revert parts of the code from the versioning repository, which would be more time-consuming. With comment programming, when such a request for reverting to an old implementation arises, the developer just comments the current implementation and uncomments the previous. It is advisable to add short descriptive comments to blocks of commented code. ==Practical uses== A related, but separate, more practical use of comments is for creating stubs with comments describing a feature (usually using special tags) ahead of future development of that feature. For example, this programming process can be used for prototyping a new design pattern. This is done by creating a new structure of classes or functions without any implementation and adding the implementation at a later date. Pseudocode Example: function onClick() { // This is where we handle mouse click. // The result of this function is that a button will be highlighted. } In the example, there is a structure around a click event handler. However, comment programming is used instead of a real implementation. The idea is that many functions can be written like this, and then the design can be reworked and revisited without having to refactor a lot of source code. ==Popular culture== MSDN Sweden produced a video for April Fools' Day 2010, where they satirically presented CDD as if it were a serious methodology.http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/MSDNSweden/Comment-Driven- Development-the-art-of-removal/ ==References== Category:Software development philosophies ","title":"Comment programming"},{"id":"20513636","text":"The Indians Baseball Club is a baseball club that participates in the Greater Brisbane League competition and the Brisbane South competition.

A. nummularia is native to Australia and occurs in each of the mainland states, thriving in arid and semi-arid inland regions. == Description == Atriplex nummularia is a perennial halophyte species that is extremely hardy, thriving in particularly harsh environments such as saline and alkaline lowlands. A. nummularia is the largest species of Australian saltbush, typically growing 2–4m wide and up to 3m tall in either a sprawling or erect arrangement. It develops a lattice of woody stems which branch from or close to ground level and utilises a taproot with a subsequent root system that is moderate to deep. It is a deciduous plant, with simple alternate leaves that often have dull teeth and are irregular in shape, varying between circular and triangular. The leaves range between 1–5 cm long and have a silvery-grey coating on both sides with a scaly texture. Although hermaphroditic variations with bisexual flowers have been reported this species is generally regarded as dioecious, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. The male flowers are at the ends of branches in disjunct beads, whereas the female flowers grow along panicles in dense clusters typically around 20 cm in length. After the female flower has been fertilised, leafy bracts become enlarged and surround the developing seed. The seeds themselves are typically round with a thick, woody seed coat and an overall reddish-brown appearance. Attached only at the base, the fruiting bracteoles are fan shaped and generally grow between 0.5–1 cm wide. == Taxonomy and naming == Atriplex nummularia was first described as a species by John Lindley in 1848. It belongs to the genus Atriplex which comprises 298–377 species commonly referred to as a saltbush. A. nummularia is originally from the family Chenopodioideae which contains approximately 165 genera and 2040 species. More recently, this was included in Amaranthaceae (sensu lato). through the introduction of the APG II system in 2003. The genus name Atriplex is a Latin word meaning \\"saltbush\\" and the specific epithet (nummularia) is derived from the Latin word nummus meaning \\"coin\\", referring to the circular shape of the leaves. Its Noongar names are purngep, pining, and binga. == Distribution and habitat == Originally a native Australian plant, Atriplex nummularia naturally occurs New South Wales, the Northern Territory, Queensland, South Australia, Victoria and Western Australia. It usually occurs on saline, low-lying clay soils such as floodplains, but is highly adaptable and can occur in most soils. Atriplex nummularia also thrives in temperate and sub-tropical regions of the world, occurring throughout Taiwan and many parts of Oceania. It has also been introduced to most Middle- Eastern and North African countries, as well as South Africa, Mexico, Chile, Spain and the USA. A. nummularia is typically found in lowland areas such as floodplains in both the Northern and Southern hemispheres, favouring saline clay soils. == Behavioural == The name saltbush fittingly describes a function of the species in which they retain salt in their leaves absorbed with water through osmosis. Optimal growth is achieved in places where the mean annual temperature is between 15–24 °C and where rainfall is between 230–650mm per annum, though conditions outside this range may be tolerated once the plant has become well established. A. nummularia primarily grows on alluvial or limestone soils and while extremely tolerant of both saline and alkaline conditions, it does not cope in an acidic environment. The species is able to grow in soils ranging from clays to sand, but is best suited to well-drained soils that have a deep profile. Though a saline environment deters most pests A. nummularia is not totally immune. The lucerne flea (Sminthurus viridis) and red-legged earth mite(Halotydeus destructor) are the most common and can infest the plant, causing significant damage that results in the malformation of new growth. It may also become sporadically attacked by a native saltbush scale, usually managed naturally through environmental processes. A. nummularia is often used as a food source for the larvae of some species including Lepidoptera and provide a habitat for arthropods including arachnids such as Phidippus californicus. == Reproduction and dispersal == A. nummularia seeds Atriplex nummularia generally produces small wind-pollinated flowers throughout the winter months (June–August), although this may vary according to seasonal temperature fluctuations. Seed production is often subject to immense variation with saltbush fruit commonly containing no seeds. The seeds that do develop typically mature during the months of spring (September–November). A. nummularia has a low weed potential as its fruit contains chemicals inhibiting germination and it does not regenerate well from seed. Seed dispersal primarily occurs through the consumption of diaspores including seeded fruit by livestock such as sheep and cattle. == Uses == Atriplex nummularia is among the most commonly utilised forage shrubs in Australia and has become widely cultivated for stock fodder. This is primarily a result of its propensity to survive in harsh environments subject to flooding, drought and high levels of salinity, as well as being palatable to livestock due to the elevated mineral content of the plant. The seeds from the plant are a traditional food source for many Australian Aboriginal communities, both consuming them on their own and as a component of meals. A. nummularia is also used as a windbreak, stock shade, crop shelter-belt, screen or hedge, firebreak, erosion control and soil binder particularly for stabilising sand dunes as well as rehabilitating eroded or scorched soils. Grubs found in the roots were eaten either raw or roasted by Noongar people, and the leaves and roots were mashed and boiled with water, to bathe skin sores wounds and burns, while early settlers reportedly drank the same decoction to treat scurvy. == Conservation actions == Atriplex nummularia occurs in several protected areas, including the following in New South Wales: *Kinchega National Park *Mungo National Park *Murrumbidgee Valley National Park *Mutawintji National Park *Paroo-Darling National Park *Sturt National Park *Yanga National Park == Gallery == File:Atriplex nummularia - Large shrub.jpgA. nummularia - Large shrub File:Atriplex nummularia - Stem and leaf.jpgA. nummularia - Stem and leaf segment File:Atriplex nummularia 2c.JPGA. nummularia - Fruit and flowers == References  External links == *Jepson Manual Treatment *USDA Plants Profile nummularia Category:Forages Category:Caryophyllales of Australia Category:Flora of New South Wales Category:Flora of the Northern Territory Category:Flora of Queensland Category:Flora of South Australia Category:Flora of Victoria (Australia) Category:Flora of Namibia Category:Eudicots of Western Australia ","title":"Atriplex nummularia"},{"id":"20513644","text":"Daniel Rich (born 7 June 1990) is a professional Australian rules footballer playing for the Brisbane Lions in the Australian Football League (AFL). He was recruited with the seventh overall selection in the 2008 national draft. ==Early life== Prior to being drafted by Brisbane, Rich had already amassed a considerable football résumé. This included under-18 selection for Western Australia in both 2007 and 2008, including selection for the All-Australian team both years, as well as playing in two senior premierships for Subiaco in the WAFL. Following strong performances at senior level, Rich was regarded by many observers as a potential top-two selection in the months leading up to the draft. ==AFL career== Rich during pre-season training in December 2008 Rich made an impressive senior debut in round 1, 2009 amassing 21 possession and 4 tackles, a performance which garnered him the NAB Rising Star nomination for round 1. He was rewarded for an outstanding first-year season with the 2009 NAB Rising Star award, being only the second Rising Star winner to poll maximum votes from all 9 judges, he also created history by becoming the third consecutive player to be drafted at pick seven and win the award. The praise for Rich's debut season kept coming, this time coming from the players themselves, after winning the AFLPA award for Best First Year Player by more than 400 votes. Following a stellar first season in 2009 which saw him win the AFL Rising Star award among other honours, Rich added bulk to his frame over the 2010 pre-season and established himself as a key component of the Lions midfield in 2010. While he was consistently among the Lions top performers in the midfield, he particularly shone in the half-back line towards the tail-end of the season in the Lions’ narrow loss to St Kilda in round 15, against Melbourne in round 18, and Essendon in round 21. He led the Lions in inside 50s (93) and was second for tackles with 103, and had an impressive average of 19 disposals per game. He finished inside the top ten in the 2010 Merrett–Murray Medal, at eighth place with 24.5 votes. Rich played his 100th AFL game against in round two, 2014, but suffered a season-ending ACL injury in the loss to the Gold Coast Suns the following week.Brisbane Lions confirm ACL injury for Daniel Rich, The Age, 7 April 2014 ==Personal life== Rich was educated in Western Australia, attending secondary schooling at Sacred Heart College, Sorrento. ==Statistics== : Statistics are correct to the end of the 2017 seasonhttp://afltables.com/afl/stats/players/D/Daniel_Rich.html - eaeaea;\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   2009 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  10  24  14  17  245  170  415  71  106  0.6  0.7  10.2  7.1  17.3  3.0  4.4 - ! scope=\\"row\\"   2010 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  10  22  6  14  237  189  426  61  103  0.3  0.6  10.8  8.6  19.4  2.8  4.7 -eaeaea;\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text- align:center\\"  2011 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  10  16  14  12  198  109  307  42  76  0.9  0.8  12.4  6.8  19.2  2.6  4.8 - ! scope=\\"row\\"   2012 style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  10  20  20  13  269  165  434  73  65  1.0  0.7  13.5  8.3  21.7  3.7  3.3 -eaeaea;\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   2013 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  10  16  13  9  166  130  296  27  45  0.8  0.6  10.4  8.1  18.5  1.7  2.8 - ! scope=\\"row\\"   2014 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  10  3  0  1  24  23  47  11  8  0  0.3  8.0  7.7  15.7  3.7  2.7 -eaeaea;\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   2015 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  10  21  9  8  240  168  408  57  67  0.4  0.4  11.4  8.0  19.4  2.7  3.2 - ! scope=\\"row\\"   2016 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  10  21  17  8  256  156  412  67  93  0.8  0.4  12.2  7.4  19.6  3.2  4.4 -eaeaea;\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   2017 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  10  22  8  11  322  147  469  81  35  0.4  0.5  14.6  6.7  21.3  3.7  1.6 - class=\\"sortbottom\\" ! colspan=3 Career ! 165 ! 101 ! 93 ! 1957 ! 1257 ! 3214 ! 490 ! 598 ! 0.6 ! 0.6 ! 11.9 ! 7.6 ! 19.5 ! 3.0 ! 3.6 } ==ReferencesCategory:1990 births Category:Living people Category:Brisbane Lions players Category:Subiaco Football Club players Category:Australian rules footballers from Western Australia Category:AFL Rising Star winners Category:People from Perth, Western Australia Category:People educated at Sacred Heart College, Sorrento ","title":"Daniel Rich"},{"id":"20513687","text":"Map of the cemetery.

It is native to the coastline of Southern California, including the Channel Islands, and Baja California, where it grows in saline habitat on the immediate coastline, such as beach bluffs. It is an uncommon plant, chiefly because much of its native habitat has been drastically altered. This is a mat-forming annual herb producing scaly, reddish green, prostrate stems 10 to 30 centimeters long. The leaves are less than 2 centimeters long, usually oval in shape, with gray- green scaly undersides. Male flowers are borne in terminal spike inflorescences that emerge from the distal end of the branches, while female flower clusters appear proximally on the branches. ==External links== * Calflora Database: Atriplex pacifica (Pacific saltbrush, South coast saltbush) *Jepson Manual eFlora (TJM2) treatment of Atriplex pacifica *USDA Plants Profile for Atriplex pacifica (Davidson's saltbush) *Flora of North America *UC Photos gallery: Atriplex pacifica pacifica Category:Halophytes Category:Flora of California Category:Flora of Baja California Category:Natural history of the California chaparral and woodlands Category:Natural history of the Channel Islands of California Category:Plants described in 1904 ","title":"Atriplex pacifica"},{"id":"20513733","text":"Gerhard Schröder (ex Chancellor of Germany) and Rolf Dobelli on stage at ZURICH.MINDS (12 Dec 2012) WORLD.MINDS (formerly ZURICH.MINDS) is a non-profit foundation set up in June 2008 by Rolf Dobelli.

One of the oldest artificial lakes in the country, and the oldest water supply reservoir still in use in the country,2003 conference notes, Geological Society of New Zealand it was created in the 1860s to provide water for the city of Dunedin, at that time in the middle of rapid expansion due to the Otago goldrush. Designed by engineer Ralph Donkin and supervising builder David Proudfoot, the reservoir was opened in 1867 as the Royal Albert Reservoir, but the name was unpopular and it has been known as the Ross Creek Reservoir for over a century. Reservoir valve tower The reservoir, dams, and picturesque valve tower have a New Zealand Historic Places Trust Level I classification. The reservoir is located in a heavily wooded valley in the suburb of Glenleith, four kilometres north of the city centre. Fed by a small stream, the Ross Creek — a tributary of the Water of Leith — it is held behind two small dams, 23 metres and 10 metres in height. The base of the larger dam is 95 metres above sea level, with the water surface at approximately 115 metres ASL. ==Ross Creek Reserve== The School Creek Waterfall was created when the waters of Ross Creek were diverted during construction of the reservoir. The reservoir is surrounded by a public reserve which has been allowed to regenerate with native bush. Though not technically covered by the New Zealand Reserves Act, the area is referred to as a reserve and managed and maintained as such by the Dunedin City Council, by virtue of its high scenic and recreational value.Hamel, A. (2008) Dunedin tracks and Trails. Dunedin:Silver Peaks Press. pp. 2.04-06. This lies between Tanner and Rockside Roads in Glenleith and Cannington Road in Maori Hill. The winding Burma Road runs through the reserve to the north and west of the reservoir. One of Dunedin's most popular golf courses, Balmacewen Golf Course, abuts the reserve's southwest corner. The highest point in the reserve, in its northeastern corner close to Tanner Road, is some above sea level. Numerous popular walking tracks lead to and circle the reservoir, and follow the course of the Ross Creek and its tributary, School Creek. Track counters have recorded as many as 4,000 walkers on the tracks per month, making them some of Dunedin's most well-used bush walks. The tracks are marked with stone markers, and a permanent orienteering course is also marked numbered posts. The walks can be entered from various points along Burma and Tanner Roads, but the main entry is from lower down Ross Creek at Glenleith. A further track links the reserve with a walkway which follows the course of the Water of Leith past a former quarry to link with tracks which run through Woodhaugh Gardens at the mouth of the Leith Valley to the southeast. Notable features of the reserve — other than the reservoir — include a waterfall which cascades some into School Creek. Though these falls appear completely natural, they were created by the diversion of Ross Creek to form the reservoir, and now carry waters from the creek's flood channel. The lower parts of the reserve's tracks close to Glenleith are also notable, as they pass through the narrowest part of the Ross Creek's valley, which rises as canyon walls on both sides of the track and creek. ==NotesReferences== * Herd, J., and Griffiths, G.

The winner of the competition gains entry to the first round of the German Cup. It was introduced in 1945. In 2011 the cup was renamed from WFV- Pokal into Bitburger-wfv-Pokal because of a new name sponsoring by the brewery Bitburger. WFV stands for Württembergischer Fußball-Verband (football association of the region Württemberg). ==History== The three states that merged to form Baden-Württemberg in 1952 The competition was established in 1945 in the Württemberg part of Württemberg-Baden and in Württemberg- Hohenzollern. In 1952, these two states merged with South Baden to form Baden- Württemberg but three separate football associations, Württemberg, Baden and South Baden, remained and also their regional cups. Initially, the final was held at a neutral ground but from 1967 onwards, one of the two finalists received home advantage. Occasionally, it would however still be held at a neutral venue when the club with the home advantage didn't have a suitable stadium. After 1981, the competitions final returned to a neutral venue. From 1974 onwards, the winner of the WFV Cup qualified for the first round of the German Cup. At times, the WFV was permitted to send both, winner and finalist to the first round of the German Cup, currently (2008–09), it is only the winner as Württemberg is not one of the three largest federations, which are permitted to send two clubs. Possibly the most remarkable WFV-Cup winner in terms of German Cup appearance was the SC Geislingen in 1984–85. The club drew Hamburger SV for the first round and beat the Bundesliga club 2–0, then defeated Kickers Offenbach 4–2 to go out in the third round 0–2 to the later winners Bayer Uerdingen. ==Modus== Professional clubs are not permitted to enter the competition, meaning, no teams from the Bundesliga and the 2. Bundesliga can compete. All clubs from Württemberg playing from the 3. Liga to the four Landesligas (VII) gain direct entry to the first round. To make up the set number of 128 clubs for the first round, the best teams from the Bezirkspokale, which teams below tier seven play in, are also admitted. ==Cup finals== Held annually at the end of season, these were the cup finals since 1950: {  - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"#dfdfdf\\"  Season  Location  Winner  Finalist  Result  Attendance - align=\\"center\\"  1950–51  Schorndorf, 26 August 1951  ESC Ulm  TSG Öhringen  3–0  1,500 - align=\\"center\\"  1951–53  colspan=5 not held - align=\\"center\\"  1953–54  Echterdingen, 15 August 1954  FV 09 Nürtingen  Stuttgarter SC  3–2  1,500 - align=\\"center\\"  1954–55  Tübingen, 23 July 1955  Stuttgarter SC  SpVgg Trossingen  5–0  2,000 - align=\\"center\\"  1955–56  Sindelfingen, 28 July 1956  1.

He was described as being tall, of fair complexion and having a mole on the right side of his nose. He was a fond huntsman and enjoyed hunting big game including elephants, bears and wolves. He was also a deeply religious person and had the Mahabharata recited to him every night. He was initially reluctant to join the rebellion but agreed to do so on the insistence of his brother and the commander-in-chief, Hare Krishna Singh. ==Role in the 1857 rebellion== Picture of the Siege of Arrah in which Babu Amar Singh was part of the attacking forces Babu Amar Singh originally assisted in his brothers campaign including the infamous Siege of Arrah. After the death of Babu Kunwar Singh on 24 April 1858, Babu Amar Singh became the chief of the army and despite heavy odds, continued the struggle and for a considerable time ran a parallel government in the district of Shahabad. Four days after the death of his brother, he heard reports about British tax collectors in Arrah. He subsequently led an attack on them and defeated them. He was assisted by his commander-in-chief, Hare Krishna Singh. A soldier who served Amar Singh and was captured in 1858 gave some details about his forces. He stated that after Amar Singh retreated into the hills, he had around 400 cavalry-men and six guns. The guns were obtained from a mechanic in Calcutta who served Amar Singh directly. The force also had cannon balls that were manafuctured in Jagdispur with lead they obtained from raids on British boats. Amar Singh was also planning to join his force with fellow rebel leader Nana Sahib. One the 6th of June 1858, Amar Singh and his force of 2000 sepoys and 500 sawars arrived in the village of Gahmar in Ghazipur near the border with Bihar. The Sakarwar Rajput rebels from this region, under the leadership of Meghar Singh, were keen for Amar Singh's support and a letter was composed in a village requesting his help. Amar Singh accepted their request. Meghar Singh personally presented Amar Singh with a nazrana or gift worth Rs 20,000. They exchanged supplies and Amar Singh left Gahmar on the 10th of June. Among the motivations for this alliance were the marital ties shared between the Sakarwars and the Ujjainiyas. In October 1859, after subsequent guerilla skirmishes with the British, Amar Singh fled with other rebel leaders to the Nepal Terai. He presumably went into hiding after this and disappeared before being captured later that same year and dying in prison.

This method avoids the extremes of the \\"push-crash\\" cycle of over-exercising during remittance or not exercising at all due to concern of relapse. Typically the GET program begins with active stretching, followed by range-of-motion contractions and extensions, done for five minutes per day for a completely inactive individual. Avoiding extremes is key, and activity must be balanced with rest. Exercise sessions should be preset by the number of repetitions or amount of time. The duration is determined by the patient using trial and error, with the goal of stopping before becoming tired. Research has suggested that gradual, guided physical activity can be helpful, though not a cure, for individuals with CFS/ME. ==Support and opposition== Some prominent health organisations support the usefulness of GET for chronic fatigue syndrome (UK's NHS,, NHS's \\"Treating chronic fatigue syndrome\\" and the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, Royal Australian College of General Practitioners's \\"Graded exercise therapy: chronic fatigue syndrome\\"). The patient group ME Association's position statement asserts that GET causes adverse reactions in a significant percentage of patients., ME Association position on graded exercise therapy. == References == Category:Medical treatments ","title":"Graded exercise therapy"},{"id":"20514003","text":"Tasimelteon (trade name Hetlioz) is a drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in January 2014 for the treatment of non-24-hour sleep–wake disorder (also called non-24, N24 and N24HSWD). In June 2014, the European Medicines Agency accepted an EU filing application for tasimelteon and in July 2015, the drug was approved in Europe for the treatment of non-24-hour sleep-wake rhythm disorder in totally blind adults, but not in the rarer case of non-24 in sighted people. Tasimelteon is a selective agonist for the melatonin receptors MT1 and MT2, similar to other members of the melatonin receptor agonist class of which ramelteon (2005) and agomelatine (2009) were the first approved. As a treatment for N24HSWD, as with melatonin or other melatonin derivatives, the patient may experience improved sleep timing while taking the drug. Reversion to baseline sleep performance occurs within a month of discontinuation. ==Development== Tasimelteon (previously known as BMS-214,778) was developed for the treatment of insomnia and other sleep disorders. A phase II trial on circadian rhythm sleep disorders was concluded in March 2005. A phase III insomnia trial was conducted in 2006. A second phase III trial on insomnia, this time concerning primary insomnia, was completed in June 2008. In 2010, the FDA granted orphan drug status to tasimelteon, then regarded as an investigational medication, for use in totally blind adults with N24HSWD. (Through mechanisms such as easing the approval process and extending exclusivity periods, orphan drug status encourages development of drugs for rare conditions that otherwise might lack sufficient commercial incentive.) On completion of Phase III trials, interpretations of the clinical trials by the research team concluded that the drug may have therapeutic potential for transient insomnia in circadian rhythm sleep disorders. A year-long (2011–2012) study at Harvard tested the use of tasimelteon in blind subjects with non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder. The drug has not been tested in children nor in any non-blind people. ==FDA approval== In May 2013 Vanda Pharmaceuticals submitted a New Drug Application to the Food and Drug Administration for tasimelteon for the treatment of non-24-hour sleep–wake disorder in totally blind people. It was approved by the FDA on January 31, 2014 under the brand name Hetlioz. In the opinion of Public Citizen, an advocacy group, the FDA erroneously allowed it to be labelled without stating that it is only approved for use by totally blind people. However, FDA updated its press release on Oct. 2, 2014 to clarify the approved use of Hetlioz, which includes both sighted and blind individuals. The update did not change the drug labeling (prescribing information). ==Toxicity== Experiments with rodents revealed fertility impairments, an increase in certain cancers, and serious adverse events during pregnancy at dosages in excess of what is considered the \\"human dose\\". == See also == * Discovery and development of melatonin receptor agonists == References == Category:Sedatives Category:Benzofurans Category:Propionamides Category:Cyclopropanes Category:Melatonin receptor agonists ","title":"Tasimelteon"},{"id":"20514011","text":"Cyril Cartwright (28 January 1924 – 29 September 2015) was a British cyclist who held national records on the track and on the road and came second in the world amateur pursuit championship in Copenhagen in 1949.

Other names by which it is known include: Palazzo Vendramin Calergi, Palazzo Loredan Vendramin Calergi, and Palazzo Loredan Griman Calergi Vendramin. The architecturally distinguished building was the home of many prominent people through history, and is remembered as the place where composer Richard Wagner died. Currently, it is home to the Venice Casino (Casinò di Venezia) and the Wagner Museum (Museo Wagner). ==History== Ca' Vendramin Calergi in 1870, photograph by Carlo Naya inscribed to Marie-Caroline de Bourbon-Sicile, duchess de Berry (1798-1870), its former owner. Ca' Vendramin Calergi was designed in the late 15th century by Mauro Codussi, architect of Chiesa di San Zaccaria and other noteworthy churches and private residences in Venice. Construction began in 1481 and was finished after his death by the Lombardo family, who completed it in 1509. The twenty-eight-year period it took to complete construction is considered short based on the technology available at that time. The spacious Renaissance-style palace stands three stories high with direct access to the Grand Canal available by gondolas. The beauty and balance of the building's façade are exceptional. Classically inspired columns divide each level facing the canal. Two pairs of tall French doors divided by a single column topped by arches and a trefoil window rest above the doors on the piano nobile and upper levels. Opulent paintings, sculptures, and architectural details originally filled the building's interior. Baroque master Mattia Bortoloni decorated the ceilings of many rooms. The palace is locally known by the nickname \\"Non Nobis Domine\\" (\\"Not unto us, O Lord\\"),\\"Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory, for thy mercy, and for thy truth's sake.\\" Psalm 115:1 KJV which is engraved in the stone under a ground-floor window. Portrait of the Vendramin Family (1543–47), painting by Titian. Andrea Loredan, a connoisseur of the fine arts, commissioned the palace, which was paid for by the doge, Leonardo Loredan. In 1581, the Loredan family suffered financial difficulties and sold it for 50,000 ducats to Eric II, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg who took loans to afford it and to host sumptuous dinners for the Venice nobility. However, the duke kept it only two years before selling it to Guglielmo I Gonzaga, Marquis of Mantua, who then sold it to Vittore Calergi, a Venetian noble from Heraklion on the island of Crete. Calergi greatly expanded the building in 1614 with a large addition by architect Vincenzo Scamozzi called the \\"White Wing\\" which included windows overlooking a garden courtyard. (The addition was demolished in 1659 and rebuilt the following year.) In 1739, the palace was inherited through marriage by the Vendramins, a powerful patrician family of merchants, bankers, religious leaders, and politicians, who owned it for more than a century. In 1844, Marie-Caroline de Bourbon-Sicile, Duchess of Berry, and her second husband, Ettore Carlo Lucchesi-Palli, Duke della Grazia, purchased Ca' Vendramin Calergi from the last member of the Vendramin family line. In the turmoil of the Risorgimento, they were forced to sell the palace to Caroline's grandson, Henry (Enrico), Count de' Bardi, and many of its fine works of art were auctioned in Paris. Count de' Bardi and his wife Infanta Adelgundes and the related Dukes of Grazia maintained the home and hosted many famous names of the day. In 1937, the last of the Grazia nobles, Count Lucchesi-Palli, sold it to Giuseppe Volpi, Count of Misurata, who remodeled the living quarters and turned it into a Center for Electromagnetic and Electrical Phenomena. The City Council of Venice purchased Ca' Vendramin Calergi in 1946. Since 1959, it has been the winter home to the celebrated Venice Casino (Casinò di Venezia).Portale di Venezia: Ca' Vendramin Calergi , downloaded 2 December 2008.Ca' Vendramin Calergi: La storia, downloaded 5 December 2008 ==Wagner Museum== Richard Wagner in 1871 The composer Richard Wagner stayed in Venice six times between 1858 and his death. He arrived in Italy on his final trip not long after performances of his opera Parsifal premiered at the second Bayreuth Festival. He rented the entire piano nobile (mezzanine) level of the Ca' Vendramin Calergi from Count de' Bardi before his departure and arrived on 16 September 1882 with his wife Cosima Liszt, four children (Daniela von Bülow, Isolde, Eva and Siegfried Wagner) and household servants. Wagner died of a heart attack in the palace on the afternoon of 13 February 1883 at age 69. A memorial plaque on a brick wall adjacent to the building is inscribed with a tribute by novelist and poet Gabriele d'Annunzio that reads: :In questo palagio / l'ultimo spiro di Riccardo Wagner / odono le anime perpetuarsi come la marea / che lambe i marmi\\"In this palace / the souls hear / the last breath of Richard Wagner / perpetuating itself like the tide / which washes the marble beneath\\"; Grimbert, Joan B. (2002). Tristan and Isolde: A Casebook. London: Routledge. p. 401 The Wagner Museum (Museo Wagner) opened at the palace in February 1995. It holds the Josef Lienhart Collection of rare documents, musical scores, signed letters, paintings, records and other heirlooms. The holdings constitute the largest private collection dedicated to Wagner outside of Bayreuth.Casino di Venezia: Wagner Museum , downloaded 2 December 2008. The museum is open to the public on Saturday mornings by appointment.

The garden was begun in 1688 by Desclouzeaux, Intendant de la Marine at Brest, as a jardin des simples for herbs and medicines on the grounds of the royal naval hospital (established 1684). Under the supervision of chief gardener Antoine Laurent (1744-1820) it developed greatly to become an important adjunct to the Jardin du Roi (now Jardin des Plantes) in Paris, as Brest's mild climate favored the cultivation of a wide variety of exotic plants from around the world. By the 19th century it had become a major botanical garden, but the slow withering of its original medical function led to a progressive decline. The garden's remnants were almost totally destroyed in World War II, along with the hospital itself, but in subsequent years the garden has been gradually been restored.

The military standard MIL- STD-1835C defines: Flat package (FP). A rectangular or square package with leads parallel to base plane attached on two opposing sides of the package periphery. The standard further defines different types with varying parameters which includes package body material, terminal location, package outline, lead form and terminal count. The main vehicle for testing of high reliability flatpack packages has been MIL-PRF-38534 (General Specification for Hybrid Microcircuits). This document outlines the general requirements of fully assembled devices, whether they are single chip, multichip, or of hybrid technology. The test procedures of these requirements are found in MIL-STD-883 (Test Methods and Procedures for Microelectronics) as a listing of test methods. These methods cover various aspects of the minimum requirements that a microelectronics device must be able to attain before it is considered a compliant device.AMETEK ECP Website http://www.ametek- ecp.com/solutions/electronicpackaging/qualitysupport ==History== A Flatpack integrated circuit on a circuit board, among TO-5 packages The original flatpack was invented by Y. Tao in 1962 while he was working for Texas Instruments to improve heat dissipation. The dual in-line package would be invented two years later. The first devices measured 1/4inch by 1/8inch (3.2mm by 6.4mm) and had 10 leads.Dummer, G.W.A. Electronic Inventions and Discoveries 2nd ed. Pergamon Press The flat package was smaller and lighter than the round TO-5 style transistor packages previously used for integrated circuits. Round packages were limited to 10 leads. Integrated circuits needed more leads to take full advantage of increasing device density. Since flat packages were made of glass, ceramic and metal, they could provide hermetic seals for circuits, protecting them from moisture and corrosion. Flat packs remained popular for military and aerospace applications long after plastic packages became standard for other application areas. ==See also== * Quad Flat Package * Integrated circuit packaging ==ReferencesExternal links== * www.ametek-ecp.com describing different types of flatpacks and special characteristics Category:Chip carriers ","title":"Flatpack (electronics)"},{"id":"20514115","text":"Joey Godee (born 2 March 1989) is a Dutch footballer who plays for Dutch Derde Divisie side DOVO.DOVO versterkt zich per direct met Kivuvu‚ dovo.nl, 3 February 2018 ==Personal== He is the son of former footballer Edwin Godee. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Voetbal International profile * Category:1989 births Category:Living people Category:Footballers from Utrecht (city) Category:Association football forwards Category:Dutch footballers Category:USV Elinkwijk players Category:Sparta Rotterdam players Category:AGOVV Apeldoorn players Category:Cercle Brugge K.S.V. players Category:Go Ahead Eagles players Category:Helmond Sport players Category:FC Dordrecht players Category:Eredivisie players Category:Eerste Divisie players Category:Belgian First Division A players ","title":"Joey Godee"},{"id":"20514121","text":"Blackening, Blackened, or Blacken may refer to: * Blacken (basin), a basin in Lake Mälaren in Sweden * Blackened (song), a 1988 Metallica song * Blackening (chemistry) or black oxide, a conversion coating for ferrous materials * Blackening (cooking), a cooking technique commonly used in the preparation of fish * Blackening (Scottish wedding custom), performed in the days or weeks prior to marriages in Scotland * The Blackening, a 2007 album by thrash metal band Machine Head ","title":"Blackening"},{"id":"20514122","text":"Kevin Strootman (born 13 February 1990) is a Dutch footballer who plays as a midfielder for French club Marseille and the Netherlands national team. ==Club careerSparta Rotterdam=== Born in Ridderkerk, Strootman began his career with Sparta Rotterdam, making his professional debut during the 2007–08 season. He signed a contract extension with the club in November 2008. After they were relegated at the end of the 2009–10 Eredivisie season, he played with Sparta in the Eerste Divisie. ===Utrecht=== In the January transfer window of 2011, Strootman was signed by FC Utrecht. He played with Utrecht in the second half of the 2010–11 season, before moving to PSV in June 2011. ===PSV=== Strootman was joined at PSV with fellow Utrecht recruit Dries Mertens. Strootman made his PSV debut in a 3–1 home win against AZ. He made 88 total appearances for the Eindhoven club. ===Roma=== On 16 July 2013, PSV and Roma finalized a deal for Strootman's transfer to the Italian side, in a deal worth €17 million, with the fee potentially rising to €19 million through add- ons.PSV ontvangt bankgaranties, Strootman-deal rond (Dutch) He was given the number 6 shirt. In a pre-season friendly against the Major League Soccer (MLS) All-Stars, Strootman scored one goal and assisted another as Roma prevailed 3–1 at Sporting Park, Kansas City, Kansas. He scored his first competitive goal for Roma in 3–1 Serie A victory over Parma. He went on to score in matches against Torino, Atalanta, Milan and Livorno. On 9 March 2014, Strootman sustained a knee injury in Roma's 1–0 defeat to Napoli which made him miss the remainder of the 2013–14 season and the 2014 FIFA World Cup, where the Dutch selection finished third. On 9 November, Strootman made his first appearance for Roma in exactly eight months, appearing as an 84th-minute substitute in a 3–0 defeat of Torino at the Stadio Olimpico. His first start of the 2014–15 season came in a 2–2 draw with Sassuolo on 7 December. He assisted the first of captain Francesco Totti's two goals after appearing as a substitute in Roma's 2–2 draw with Lazio in the 175th Derby della Capitale on 12 January 2015. On 26 January 2015, Strootman was substituted in a Serie A fixture against Fiorentina after sustaining further damage to his anterior cruciate ligament. Three days later, it was confirmed that the player would again undergo knee surgery. On 26 August, it was reported that, in spite of failing to make a single appearance in seven months, Strootman's injury required further surgery which sidelined the player for the majority of the 2015–16 Serie A season. He made his first appearance of the season on 21 February 2016, as a substitute in a 5–0 home defeat of Palermo. On 2 May, he made his first start in over 15 months, playing the full 90 minutes in Roma's 3–2 win at Genoa. He ended the season with five appearances, including two starts. His only assist of the season came in a 3–1 final day victory over Milan at the San Siro. On 20 August 2016, Strootman captained Roma in the opening match of the 2016–17 Serie A season, a 4–0 home win against Udinese. In the team's second fixture, he scored his first goal since January 2014 as Roma drew 2–2 at Cagliari. On 29 May 2017, Strootman signed a new five-year contract with the 2017 Serie A runners-up. ===Marseille=== On 28 August 2018, Olympique de Marseille agreed with A.S. Roma on a €25 million (plus €3 million of bonus) transfer fee and signed Strootman on a five-year contract. AS Roma published a thank you and confirmation of the transfer on their website. Strootman mentioned the club's history, ambitions as well as his close relationship with coach Rudi Garcia as motivating factors to join the club. On 10 January 2020, Strootman scored an 84th minute winner for Marseille after coming on as a substitute against Rennes. ==International career== Strootman made his senior international debut for the Netherlands against Austria in 2011 and scored his first international goal against Finland in a UEFA Euro 2012 qualifier. He was a member of the Netherlands' squad at Euro 2012 but did not appear in any matches as the Dutch were knocked out at the group stage. He appeared for the Netherlands U21 team at the 2013 UEFA Euro U21 Championship where the team reached the semi-finals, losing to Italy. Strootman was a regular in Louis van Gaal's side during the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifying campaign, but missed the tournament finals due to injury. On 27 May 2016, Strootman made his first international appearance in two years after missing both the 2014 FIFA World Cup and the entirety of the team's unsuccessful UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying campaign. He was selected to start in a friendly match against the Republic of Ireland, playing 70 minutes before being substituted for Marco van Ginkel. ==Style of play== Strootman is said to be a dynamic and tough-tackling midfielder, who also possesses good vision, technique, and balance on the ball. A tall, physically strong and tactically intelligent left-footed player, he has been described as a \\"modern\\" midfielder, due to his wide range of skills. He is best used as a central or defensive midfielder, often serving as either a box-to-box midfielder or mezzala – due to his work- rate, ball-winning abilities, and ability to help out in both attack and defence – or as a deep-lying playmaker, due to his range of passing, awareness, and ability to create goalscoring opportunities for his teammates after winning back possession. He is also capable of contributing to his team's offensive play with goals, courtesy of his powerful and accurate striking ability from outside the area, as well as his ability to get on the end of his teammates' passes by making late attacking runs into the box from behind. Strootman has been compared to compatriot Mark van Bommel. During his first season with Roma (2013–14), he earned the nickname la lavatrice (\\"the washing machine\\", in Italian), for his ability to always clean up play by winning back the ball and then distributing it precisely to his teammates. ==Career statisticsClub=== . {  style=\\"text- align:center\\" - ! colspan=3  Club performance ! colspan=2  League ! colspan=2  Cup ! colspan=2  Continental ! colspan=2  Other ! colspan=2  Total - !

Such a practice is now less common due to waste regulations and so some dry docks where ships are broken (to recycle their metal and remove dangerous materials like asbestos) are also known as ship graveyards. By analogy, the phrase can also refer to an area with many shipwrecks which not been removed by human agency, instead being left to disintegrate naturally. These can form in places where navigation is difficult or dangerous (such as the Seven Stones, off Cornwall, or Blackpool, on the Irish Sea); or where many ships have been deliberately scuttled together (as with the German High Seas Fleet at Scapa Flow); or where many ships have been sunk in battle (such as Ironbottom Sound, in the Pacific).

Richard Howland Hunt, the older son, studied architecture at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the École des Beaux-Arts, Paris, where his father Richard Morris Hunt had studied. In 1887 Richard Howland Hunt joined his father's offices, first as a draftsman and later an associate. In the interim following his father's death he attracted wealthy clients and built residences such as the Margaret Shepard house at 5 East 66th Street (1900), now housing the Lotos Club. Joseph Howland Hunt studied at Harvard College and the School of Architecture at Columbia University before following his brother to the École des Beaux-Arts, returning to New York in 1901. Urban residences by Hunt & Hunt include the two Beaux-Arts houses designed for George W. Vanderbilt at 645 and 647 Fifth Avenue, known as The \\"Marble Twins\\".

Big in Japan is an expression that can be used to describe Western (especially North American or European) musical groups who achieve success in Japan but not necessarily in other parts of the world. However, the expression is commonly used ironically to mean successful in a limited, potentially comical, oddly specific, or possibly unverifiable way. ==Original usage== The phrase began to appear in several major Japanese foreign-rock magazines, especially Music Life magazine, in the late 1970s, and in most cases, the \\"big in Japan\\" artists became popular in Japan due to being featured by Music Life. The concept predated the phrase; Neil Sedaka made it big in Japan with \\"One Way Ticket\\" before breaking through in his native United States. Sedaka noted that Elvis Presley, the biggest rock star in America in the late 1950s, never left North America (in part because his agent Colonel Tom Parker was an illegal alien), and this opened opportunities in foreign markets such as Japan for more obscure artists such as Sedaka to gain a foothold there.Sedaka, Neil (September 15, 2020).

The Human Beinz, one-hit wonders in their native United States, scored two number one hit singles in Japan. In the summer of 1977, The Runaways, who struggled to make a mark in America, were the fourth most popular imported musical act in Japan, just behind The Beatles and Led Zeppelin. In the late 20th century, notable \\"big in Japan\\" artists included several stadium rock bands from the United States, metal artists from Northern European countries such as Norway, Denmark, and especially Sweden and Finland (e.g. the rock band Hanoi Rocks), eurobeat artists from Austria, Germany and especially Italy, and UK rockThe term \\"UK rock\\" is an only-in-Japan term used for every rock music artist from the United Kingdom.UK rock / Britpop All About artists. Some bands have used their popularity in Japan as a springboard to break into other markets. Notably, the power pop group Cheap Trick, which had been known as the \\"American Beatles\\" in Japan for their appeal, achieved widespread success with their multi-platinum live album Cheap Trick at Budokan. The band had previously struggled to break into the mainstream American market with their earlier albums. Furthermore, like Cheap Trick, some bands have lost their \\"big in Japan\\" reputations after gaining popularity in their respective homelands. The most notable example is Bon Jovi. For example, Scorpions initially had only limited success in Europe and the United States, yet were \\"Big in Japan\\", as evidenced by their 1978 tour of the country and the double live album Tokyo Tapes.

Around this time, the band's popularity in Europe had been waning due to changing musical tastes, particularly in their home country where they had relatively few hits, none of them topping the charts. They went on a few more tours there in the late '60s and occasionally toured there in the '70s, '80s and for the last time in 1998. While their popularity in Japan is small compared to The Ventures, \\"Karelia\\" is considered a classic song. The phrase was used as the name of a UK punk band active from 1977 to 1982 (whose name inspired the title of a 1984 hit single by new wave band Alphaville) and was the name of the lead track on the Grammy-winning 1999 album Mule Variations by Tom Waits. The mockumentary This is Spinal Tap parodies this phenomenon when the band schedules a Japanese tour after discovering that their single \\"Sex Farm\\" is inexplicably selling very well there. American band Mountain reformed for a successful tour of Japan in 1973. A live album titled Twin Peaks was released in 1974.

It is the fourth most populous autonomous community after Andalusia, Catalonia and Madrid with more than five million inhabitants. Its homonymous capital Valencia is the third largest city and metropolitan area in Spain. It is located along the Mediterranean coast on the east side of the Iberian peninsula. It borders with Catalonia to the north, Aragon and Castilla–La Mancha to the west, and Murcia to the south. The Valencian Community consists of three provinces which are Castellón, Valencia and Alicante. According to Valencia's Statute of Autonomy, the Valencian people are a nationality. Their origins date back to the Aragonese reconquest of the Moorish Taifa of Valencia, which was taken by James I of Aragon in 1238 during the Reconquista. The newly founded Kingdom of Valencia was granted wide self-government under the Crown of Aragon. Valencia experienced its golden age in the 15th century, as it became the Crown's economic capital. Self-government continued after the unification of the Spanish Kingdom, but was eventually suspended in 1707 by Phillip V of Spain as a result of the Spanish War of Succession. Valencian nationalism resurged towards the end of the 19th century, which led to the modern conception of the Valencian Country. Self-government under the Generalitat Valenciana was finally reestablished in 1982 after Spanish transition to democracy. Many Valencian people speak Valencian, the region's own co-official language, also known as Catalan in other regions.According to article Catalan language from Britannica Online Encyclopedia Valencian is a diglossic language that was repressed and prosecuted during Franco's dictatorship (1939–1975) in favour of Spanish.The implementation of Franco's regime in the Valencian Community since 1939 meant the Valencian ban on its use on the radio, books, theater, different civilians forms such as wedding invitations, signs and announcements, person's first names, cinema (until 1964), in all public and private schools, on the gravestones of the cemeteries and mortuary skeletons, in the nomenclature of hotels, restaurants or brands, on inscriptions in the Civil register, on the names of the streets, among other fields. Ministerio de la Gobernación (Gazeta of 17 May 1940) (CCITT T.& G4 Facsimile TIFF). Order of 16 May 1940 forbidding the use of generic foreign terms in lettering, samples, advertisements, etc. Since it regained official status in 1982 in the Valencian Statute of Autonomy, Valencian has been implemented in public administration and the education system, leading to an exponential increase in knowledge of its formal standard. According to the general survey from 2015, Valencian is understood by almost the entire population living within the Valencian Community and is spoken by a wide majority, but almost half of the population cannot write it. ==Etymology== Valencia was founded by the Romans under the name of \\"Valentia Edetanorum\\", which translates to 'Valiance (or Courage) of the Land of the Lamb'. With the establishment of the Taifa of Valencia, the name developed to (Balansīyah), which eventually became Valencia after the expulsion of the Moors. === Naming controversy === \\"Valencian Community\\" is the standard translation of the official name in Valencian recognized by the Statute of Autonomy of 1982 (Comunitat Valenciana). This is the name most used in public administration, tourism, the media and Spanish written language. However, the variant of \\"Valencian Country\\" (País Valencià) that emphasizes the nationality status of the Valencian people is still the preferred one by left-wing parties, civil associations, Catalan written language and major academic institutions like the University of Valencia. \\"Valencian Community\\" is a neologism that was specifically adopted after democratic transition in order to solve the conflict between two competing names: \\"Valencian Country\\" and \\"Former Kingdom of Valencia\\". On one hand, \\"Valencian Country\\" represented the modern conception of nationality that resurged in the 19th century. It became well-established during the Second Spanish Republic and later on with the works of Joan Fuster in the 1960s, implying the existence of the \\"Catalan Countries\\" (Països Catalans). This nationalist subtext was opposed by anti-Catalan blaverists, who proposed \\"Former Kingdom of Valencia\\" (Antic Regne de València) instead, in order to emphasize Valencian independence from Catalonia. Currently, blaverists have accepted the official denomination. The autonomous community can be homonymously identified with its capital \\"Valencia\\".According to article Valencia from Britannica Online Encyclopedia However, this could be disregarding of the provinces of Alicante and Castellón. Other more anecdotal translations have included \\"Land of Valencia\\",Scenery in Land of Valencia , edited by the Valencian Agency of Tourism \\"Region of Valencia\\"Terms mainly used from the Department of Tourism of the Valencian Government. See official publications, and an example of using \\"Region of Valencia\\". The other term, \\"Land of Valencia\\" is also used by this department and \\"Valencian Region\\".CVNews, English-language magazine published by the Valencia Region Tourist Board The term \\"Region\\", however, carries negative connotations among many Valencians because it could deny their nationality status. ==History== Iberian-Greek-Carthaginian-Roman city of Akra Leuke or Lucentum, Alicante. Villena castle The Pre-Roman autochthonous people of the Valencian Community were the Iberians, who were divided in several groups (the Contestani, the Edetani, the Ilercavones and the Bastetani). The Greeks established colonies in the coastal towns of Saguntum and Dénia beginning in the 5th century BC, where they traded and mixed with the local Iberian populations. After the end of the First Punic War between Carthage and Rome in 241 BC, which established their limits of influence in the Ebro river, the Carthaginians occupied the whole region. The dispute over the hegemony of Saguntum, a Hellenized Iberian coastal city with diplomatic contacts with Rome, destroyed by Hannibal in 219 BC, ignited the Second Punic War, which ended with the incorporation of the region to the Roman Empire. The Romans founded the city of Valentia in 138 BC, which, over the centuries overtook Saguntum in importance. After the Fall of the Western Roman Empire, during the Barbarian Invasions in the 5th century AD, the region was first invaded by the Alans and finally ruled by the Visigoths, until the arrival of the Arabs in 711, which left a broad impact in the region, still visible in today's Valencian landscape and culture. After the fall of the Caliphate of Cordoba, two main independent taifas were established at the region, Balansiya and Dénia, along with the small and short living taifas of Orihuela, Alpuente, Jérica and Sagunt and the short Christian conquest of Valencia by El Cid. However, the origins of present-day Valencia date back to the Kingdom of Valencia, which came into existence in the 13th century. James I of Aragon led the Christian conquest and colonization of the existing Islamic taifas with Aragonese and Catalan colonizers in 1208; they founded the Kingdom of Valencia as a third independent country within the Crown of Aragon in 1238. The kingdom developed intensively in the 14th and 15th centuries, which are considered the Golden Age of the Valencian Culture,:es:Siglo de Oro Valenciano with significant works like the chivalric romance of Tirant lo Blanch. Valencia developed into an important kingdom in Europe economically through the silk trade. It also rose to power politically with the rise of the Crown of Aragon, (within which the Kingdom of Valencia had achieved the largest population and the greatest economic power at that timeJosé Escribano Úbeda-Portugués: España y Europa a través de la Historia. Desde el siglo XV al Siglo XVIII pp 16-17) and the ascension of the Valencian House of Borja in Rome. After a slow decline following the dynastic union of the Crown of Aragon with the Kingdom of Castile, Valencia's successful status came to a definite end with the Expulsion of the Moriscos in 1609 by the Hispanic Monarchy, which represented the loss of up to one third of the population of the Kingdom of Valencia and took the main agricultural labor force away.city of Valencia In 1707, in the context of the War of the Spanish Succession, and by means of the Nova Planta decrees, king Philip V of Spain abolished the Kingdom of Valencia, and the rest of states belonging to the former Crown of Aragon and which had retained some autonomy, and subordinated it to the structure of the Kingdom of Castile and its laws and customs. As a result of this, the institutions and laws created by the Furs of Valencia (Furs de València) were abolished and the usage of the Valencian language in official instances and education was forbidden. Consequently, with the House of Bourbon, a new Kingdom of Spain was formed implementing a more centralized government and absolutist regime than the former Habsburg Spain. The first attempt to gain self-government, or autonomous government, for the Valencian Country in modern-day Spain was during the Second Spanish Republic, in 1936, but the Civil War broke out and the autonomist project was suspended.:es:Proyecto de Estatuto de Autonomía para el País Valenciano (1937) In 1977, after Franco's dictatorship Valencia started to be partially autonomous with the creation of the Council of the Valencian Country (Consell del País Valencià),:es:Real Decreto-Ley 10/1978, de 17 de marzo, por el que se aprueba el Régimen Preautonómico del País Valenciano and in 1982 the self- government was finally extended into a Statute of Autonomy (Estatut d'Autonomia) creating several self-government institutions under the Generalitat Valenciana. The first democratically elected President of the Generalitat Valenciana, Joan Lerma, took office in 1982 as part of the transition to autonomy. The Valencian Statute of Autonomy make clear that Valencia is intended to be the modern conception of self-government of the Valencian Country from the first autonomist movements during Second Spanish Republic, but also joining it to the traditional conception of Valencian identity, as being the successor to the historical Kingdom of Valencia. In fact, after a bipartisan reform of the Valencian Statute of Autonomy in 2006, it records the foral civil law, using the traditional conception of a kingdom, and, on the other hand, it also recognizes Valencia as a nationality, in accordance with the modern conception. ==GeographyRelief=== dry area in the South is easily noticed. Original by NASA The inland part of the territory is craggy, with some of the highest peaks in the Valencia and Castellón provinces forming part of the Iberian mountain range. The mountains in the Province of Alicante are in turn a part of the Subbaetic range. The most emblematic mountain of the Valencian Community is the Penyagolosa, in the Alcalatén area. It is widely thought to be the highest peak with 1,813 m, but actually the highest peak is the Calderón (1,839 m) located in the Rincón de Ademuz, a Valencian exclave between Aragon and Castilla–La Mancha. The most emblematic mountain in the southern part of the territory is the Aitana (1,558 m). The rather thin coastal strip is a very fertile plain mainly free of remarkable mountains except those around the Cap de la Nau area in northern Alicante province and the Peñíscola (Peníscola) area in the Castellón province. Typical of this coastal area are wetlands and marshlands such as L'Albufera close to Valencia, El Fondo in Elche (Elx) and Crevillent, La Marjal near Pego, Albufera of Gayanes in Gayanes or El Prat in Cabanes, also the former wetlands and salt evaporation ponds in the Santa Pola and Torrevieja area. All of them are key RAMSAR sites which make Valencia of high relevance for both migratory and resident seabirds and waterbirds. There are many important coastal dunes in the Saler area near the Albufera and in the Guardamar area, both of them were planted with thousands of trees during the 19th century in order to fix the dunes, thus forming now protected areas of remarkable ecologic value. In addition to mainland Valencia, the Valencian territory administers the tiny Columbretes Islands and the coastal inhabited islet of Tabarca. ===Climate=== Dénia, capital of the Marina Alta comarca Valencia has a generally mild climate, heavily influenced by the neighbouring Mediterranean sea. Still, there are important differences between areas: *Proper Mediterranean climate (Köppen Csa). It roughly goes along the coastal plain from the northernmost border through the Benidorm area (cities included here are, amongst others, Castellón de la Plana, Gandia and Valencia). It covers in various grades the lower inland areas. In this area, winters are cool, summers are long, dry and hot; rainfall occurs mostly during spring and autumn, usually totalling around 600 mm. with a remarkably wetter micro climate in the Marina Alta and the Safor comarques just north of Cap de la Nau cape, which accumulates an average of up to 1000 mm. due to an orographic lift phenomenon. *Mediterranean to continental Mediterranean climate (Köppen Csa) and highland climate (Köppen H). These are the innermost lands and those at a higher elevation (cities included here are, amongst others, Alcoy, Morella, Requena and Villena). Here winters are cool to cold, especially at night (a few days of snow are not unusual), summers mild to hot and rainfall more evenly distributed through the year. The lower registered temperatures in the Valencian Community were in these inland areas during the cold wave of 1956. Temperatures plunged to nearly −20 °C; as in Vistabella del Maestrat (−19 °C) and Castellfort (–17 °C). *Hot semi-arid climate (Köppen BSh), although in zones at the interior the average temperatures are slightly lower, being BSh in the Köppen climate classification. It roughly goes along the coastal plain from Villajoyosa through the southernmost border of the territory (cities included here are, amongst others, Alicante, Benidorm, Elche, Orihuela and Torrevieja). Summers are hot and dry, winters are mild and its most prominent feature is a very scarce precipitation, typically below 300 mm. per year which is most likely to happen during spring and autumn. The reason for this lack of precipitation is the marked rain shadow effect caused by hills to the west of the Alicante province (and, to a lesser degree, those in the northern part of the province which, in turn, enhance the inverse orographic lift effect around Cap de la Nau). ===Hydrography=== There are only two major rivers: the Segura in the Province of Alicante, whose source is in Andalusia, and the Júcar (Xúquer) in Province of Valencia, whose source is in Castilla–La Mancha. Both are subjected to very intense human regulation for cities, industries and, especially, agricultural consumption. The river Turia (Túria) is the third largest and has its source in Aragon. Most rivers in the area, such as the Vinalopó, are usually short, have little current (due to agricultural usage, climatic reasons or both) and are often completely dry during the summer. Other Valencian rivers are the Serpis and Sénia. == Demographics  Urbanization === The estimate population according to the INE on January 2019 is 5,003,769 ranking the fourth most populous in Spain. The list of largest cities is topped by Valencia, the third largest city in Spain overall: Valencian population traditionally concentrated in localities with fertile cultivation and growing lowlands by the most important rivers (Júcar, Turia, Segura, Vinalopó), also in harbour cities important to the agricultural trade. In actuality, population is particularly dense along the coast as well as in central and southern regions of the territory, and more sparse around the inner and northern regions.Areas in red mark higher population density in the central and southern regions.Important historical cities include Sagunt and Dénia in Roman times; Valencia, Alicante, Xàtiva, Orihuela, Elche, Gandia, and Villarreal (Vila-real) later on in history and, more recently, Alzira and Castellón de la Plana. Another set of noncoastal cities increased significantly in numbers due to industrialization in the 20th century, including Alcoy, Elda, Ontinyent, Petrer, Villena, and La Vall d'Uixó. Furthermore, traditionally small fishing towns like Benidorm and Torrevieja have increased in population significantly, more remarkably during summertime, due to seasonal migration of tourists.  Metropolitan areas  In more recent years, concentration in provincial capitals and its metropolitan areas has augmented considerably (e.g. Torrent, Mislata, Paterna, Burjassot, San Vicent del Raspeig, etc.). Besides Valencia, Alicante-Elche is the eighth most populous urban agglomeration in Spain. According to the INE, the largest metropolitan areas are: { - style=\\"text-align:right;\\" !Rank  Metropolitan Area  Province  Population - style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  1  Valencia  Valencia  1,705,742 - style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  2  Alicante–Elche  Alicante  785,020 - style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  3  Castellón de la Plana  Castellón  386,906 - style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  4  Alzira–Xàtiva  Valencia  348,582 - style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  5  Benidorm–Villajoyosa  Alicante  183,253 - style=\\"text-align:right;\\" } == Government Institutions of government: La Generalitat=== Valencian government In the process whereby democracy was restored in Spain between 1975 and 1978, the nationalist and regionalist parties pressed to grant home rule to certain territories in Spain. The constitution of 1978 opened a legal way for autonomous communities to be formed from provinces with common historical and cultural links. In recognition of the Valencian Country as a nationality of Spain, and in accordance to the second article of the Spanish Constitution which grants autonomy to the \\"nationalities and regions\\" that compose the Spanish nation, Valencia was granted self-government and constituted itself as an autonomous community in 1982, with the promulgation of its first Statute of Autonomy, the basic organic law, later approved by the General Courts of Spain. All autonomous communities were organized politically within a parliamentary system; that is, the executive branch of government. The \\"President\\" is dependent on the direct support of the legislative power, whose members elect him by majority. A new Statute of Autonomy was promulgated in 2006. The government of Valencia is represented by the Generalitat Valenciana (statutorily referred to simply as La Generalitat) constituted by three institutions: * the Corts Valencianes (Valencian parliament), the legislature, which is to be integrated by a minimum of ninety-two representatives (diputats) elected through universal suffrage by proportional representation for a four-year period; * the President of the Generalitat Valenciana elected by the Courts from which s/he must obtain the vote of confidence; the current President is Ximo Puig (from the Socialist Party of the Valencian Country). The Vice President is Mònica Oltra (from Compromís, a Valencianist party). * the Council of the Generalitat Valenciana (Valencian government), a collegiate institution with executive powers, integrated by the President him/herself and the cabinet members appointed by him/her. The Generalitat can also be integrated by the institutions that the Valencian Courts create. The Courts have approved the creation of the Síndic de Greuges (Ombudsman), the Sindicatura de Comptes (Public Audit Office), the Consell Valencià de Cultura (Valencian Council of Culture), the Acadèmia Valenciana de la Llengua (Valencian Academy of the Language), the Consell Jurídic Consultiu (Juridic and Consultative Council) and the Comité Econòmic i Social (Social and Economic Committee). The current government is formed by a left coalition between the Socialist Party of the Valencian Country and Compromís, with also the support of Podemos. ==Economy== Ciutat de les Arts i les Ciències, Valencia Skyline of Benidorm Valencia is long and narrow, running mainly north-south; historically, its rather steep and irregular terrain has made communications and the exploitation of the soil difficult, although the soil of the coastal plain is particularly fertile. This coastal axis has facilitated connections with Europe, either by sea through the Mediterranean, or by land through Catalonia. The Valencian territory has few natural resources; the only important mineral deposit is the marble quarried in Alicante province. Hydrological resources (see Geography above) are also lacking: the demand for water exceeds the supply, with this imbalance especially serious in Alicante province. In particularly severe drought years, the problem is managed through occasional nocturnal restrictions during summer and exploitation of aquifers. Valencia's water needs result in harsh contention with neighbouring regions such as Castilla–La Mancha and Catalonia. Agriculture--more specifically, citrus cultivation for the export market--was responsible for Valencia's first economic boom in the late 19th century, after centuries of slow development and even decay. Although in absolute terms the agricultural sector has continued to grow, the boom in the secondary and tertiary sectors during the Spanish miracle of the 1960s, has meant that its relative importance has decreased over time. The provinces of Castelló and Valencia still have thousands of hectares of citrus-producing groves and citrus continues to be a major source of income on the countryside. Province of Alicante also grows citrus, but its agriculture is more diversified with a higher presence of vegetables, especially in the Vega Baja del Segura area. Though the low insulation rate and overall stable weather during the summer may pose a threat to water supplies for agriculture and human consumption, conversely this climate allows tourism to be the province's main industry. Very dense residential housing along the coast, occupied by locals, people from inland Spain and from other EU countries (mostly from the British Isles, Benelux, Germany and Scandinavia), boosts the summertime population (and hydrological demands). In 2004, Valencia's GDP was 93.9% of the European Union average, although this figure may be too low because of the important presence of foreign residents either from other regions of Europe or as economic immigrants, who are not properly represented in the official statistics. As in all of Spain, there was significant growth in the years immediately following 2004, at least until the 2008–13 Spanish financial crisis. In 2008, the Valencia Country generated 9.7% of the Spanish GDP. In L of human resources, the unemployment rate was over 21% in 2009, and even greater among women, and the rate of activity reached 56.8% in 2002. The typical Valencian business is a small-to-medium-sized company, mainly family-owned and operated, although there are some multinationals. In addition to tourism, the Valencian Country has significant exports, and it ranks second in this respect among the Spanish autonomous communities, constituting 12% of the national total. Major exports include agricultural products, ceramic tiles, marble products and cars (Ford has an assembly line in Almussafes), which make the port of Valencia one the busiest in Europe. === Unemployment === The unemployment rate stood at 15.6% in 2018 and was higher than the national average. {  !Year !2006 !2007 !2008 !2009 !2010 !2011 !2012 !2013 !2014 !2015 !2016 !2017 !2018 - unemployment rate (in %) 8.3 8.7 12.0 20.8 22.9 24.0 27.2 28.0 25.8 22.8 20.6 18.2 15.6 } ==Language== Spanish (Castilian or castellano) has official status in all of Spain, including the Valencian Community. Aside from it, the Statute of Autonomy recognizes Valencian as the language proper to the Valencian people (llengua pròpia), and commends its protection and regulation to the Acadèmia Valenciana de la Llengua (AVL) under the Generalitat Valenciana. Valencian is the name Valencians use to refer to the Catalan language. In the Late Middle Ages, due to Valencia becoming its own kingdom, Valencians popularized the term Valencian over the term Catalan. Valencian Sign Language is widely used by Valencian deaf persons and is also granted protection under the Statute. === Areas of linguistic predominance === The traditionally Valencian-speaking territories are marked in green Not all of the Valencian territory is historically Valencian-speaking, with 10% of the population, 500,000, living in traditionally Spanish-speaking inner regions. Also large numbers of foreign immigrants since 2000 become Spanish speakers. These regions include the areas where Aragonese rather than Catalan settlers introduced Castilian-Aragonese language in the historic Kingdom of Valencia, as well as several Castilian municipalities that were annexed to the Valencian Community in the 19th century. Valencian is traditionally spoken in the more densely populated coastal areas where Catalan settlers introduced their language in the Middle Ages. These areas are delimited for administrative purposes by the Generalitat, that established different areas of linguistic predominance (predomini lingüístic). The Valencian area of linguistic predominance suffers in many cases a process of linguistic substitution, especially in the cities of Valencia and Alicante, with populations of 1 million together where Spanish has become predominant in spite of Valencian being the traditional language. Outside these areas and the traditional Spanish-speaking areas in the west Valencian predominates or is on an equal footing. === Knowledge === {  ! colspan=\\"5\\" Knowledge of Valencian - ! !1986 !1991 !2001 !2011 - Can understand 77.12% 83.24% 86.36% 84.78% - Can speak 49.49% 51.09% 48.88% 51.18% - Can read 24.36% 37.98% 47.24% 58.35% - Can write 7.03% 15.17% 24.07% 31.77% -  colspan=\\"5\\" Source: Conselleria d'Educació, Cultura i Esport (2010) Cens 2011. Dades generals coneixement } Most of the population have at least a passive knowledge of Valencian, which allows normal communication in this language across the Valencian Community. Thanks to its implementation in public administration and the education system in recent decades, knowledge of Valencian has increased phenomenally both in absolute and relative terms, most significantly in the case of its written standard. The source also reveals that knowledge varies greatly within the territory, with knowledge in the Province of Alicante being consistently lower than in Castellón and Valencia. === Social use === {  ! colspan=\\"3\\" Languages spoken at home - !Use !Valencian !Spanish - Always 28.8% 56.2% - More often 3% 2.6% - Alternatively  colspan=\\"2\\" 5.6% - Other languages  colspan=\\"2\\" 3.8% -  colspan=\\"3\\" Source: Conselleria d'Educació, Cultura i Esport (2010) Knowledge and social use of Valencian } Despite the increase in knowledge of Valencian, its social use in relative terms is declining, with only a third of the population using it at home according to the Generalitat in 2010. The data collected varies greatly within the Valencian Community, with the percentage of use being over 50% in the regions of Alcoy-Gandia and Júcar-Turia, approximately 40% in Castelló and about 15% in Alicante and the Valencia metropolitan area. === Valencian language controversy === Despite differences in dialect and denomination, linguists consider Catalan and Valencian two varieties of the same language. They feature relative uniformity in terms of vocabulary, semantics, syntax, morphology and phonology. Mutual intelligibility ranges from 90 to 95%, which is considerably higher than between dialects of an assumed single German language (High German). Furthermore, there is a dialect continuum where speakers at the Catalan–Valencian border share the same dialect. In practice, Catalan and Valencian share the same written standard, as established by the Institut d'Estudis Catalans and the AVL respectively. Much of the bibliography used in the Valencian education system consists of Catalan works and translations in Catalan with only occasionally some words being swapped for those more commonly used in Valencia. Furthermore, the Universities of Valencia and Alicante refer to Valencian studies of language and literature as Catalan Philology. In spite of these arguments, a significant proportion of Valencian population refuse to identify Valencian with Catalan. ==TransportsAir=== New Alicante Terminal being built The Valencian Community is served by three international airports: Alicante Airport, Valencia Airport and Castellón–Costa Azahar Airport. Alicante Airport, located in the south, is mainly tourist-oriented and is currently the busiest airport in the Valencian Community. Valencia Airport is located in the capital and carries more business traffic. The third airport, Castellón–Costa Azahar Airport, is located in the north of the Valencian territory and has several international connections. This airport was opened in 2011 but its first commercial flight arrived on September 2015, so it has been considered as a white elephant due to its expensive construction and maintenance and relatively less usefulness. A new terminal at Alicante Airport was opened in March 2011. The New Alicante Terminal (NAT) replaced the other two existing terminals T1 and T2, doubling the passenger capacity of the airport to 20m passengers per annum. Valencia airport is also being expanded to serve the higher passenger demand due to new flight connections to the city. ===Train=== Provisional station of Valencia The Valencian Community has an extensive rail system which connects the principal cities with the rest of Spain such as the Euromed towards Catalonia and AVE towards Madrid, or northern and southern Spain, both run by the Spanish national rail company RENFE. In December 2010 the high-speed rail (AVE) Madrid–Valencia opened as part of the Madrid–Levante high-speed rail line. High-speed lines arrive to Valencia-Joaquín Sorolla, a provisional station located south of the city center. It is expected that in the coming years the high-speed line Madrid–Valencia will reach the main Valencia-Estació del Nord through a tunnel under the new Valencia Parque Central. High-speed rail Madrid–Alicante is planned to open in 2012 with a provisional station in the outskirts. There are some medium-range plans for further high-speed connections, like the Valencia–Bilbao link via Zaragoza or the Mediterranean high-speed rail corridor. In addition, the Generalitat Valenciana has planned on building a regional high-speed rail along the coast to connect all major coastal cities like Valencia, Gandia, Dénia, Benidorm, Villajoyosa, Alicante and Torrevieja. ===Commuter rail and Metro=== Alicante light tram through the city center Cercanías (Rodalia in Valencian) is the commuter rail service that serves all three provincial capitals of Valencia and their metropolitan areas. It is operated by Cercanías Renfe, the commuter rail division of RENFE. While the Valencian-owned company, Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat Valenciana (FGV) operates a tram-train line between Alicante, Benidorm and Dénia. It also operates the city tram and metro system of Valencia (Valencia Metro) and Alicante (Alicante Tram). There is as well a third new tram and trolleybus system being built in Castellón de la Plana and its metropolitan area. Additionally both, Valencia metro and Alicante tram are being extended to serve uncovered areas, like the new tram line planned to open in the coming months towards the University of Alicante and San Vicente del Raspeig. ===Seaports=Public services Education === State Education in Spain and the Valencian Community is free and compulsory from six to sixteen years of age. The current education system is called LOE (in reference to the Llei Orgànica d'Educació). *From three to six years: Preparatory School (Infantil, popularly known as Preescolar) *From six to twelve years: Primary School (Primaria) *From twelve to sixteen years: Compulsory Secondary School (Secundaria) *From sixteen to eighteen years: Post-Secondary School (Bachillerato) Children from three to five years old in the Valencian Community have the option of attending the infantil or Pre-school stage, which is non-compulsory and free for all students. It is regarded as an integral part of the education system with infantil classes in almost every primary school. There are some separate nursery schools. Valencian students aged six to sixteen undergo primary and secondary school education, which are compulsory and free of charge. Successful students are awarded a Secondary Education Certificate, which is necessary for entering further (optional) education as for their University or Vocational Studies. Once students have finished their Batxillerat (Spanish: Bachillerato), they can take the PAU exams (Proves d'Accés a la Universitat), commonly known as Selectiu. The secondary stage of education is normally referred to by their initials, e.g. ESO standing for Educació Secundària Obligatòria. The Valencian Community is home to a number of prestigious universities like the University of Valencia, founded in 1499. At the request of James I of Aragon, Pope Innocent IV in 1246, authorized by a papal bull the establishment of estudis generals in Valencia. The University Statutes were passed by the municipal magistrates of Valencia on April 30, 1499; this is considered to be the 'founding' of the University. In 1501, Pope Alexander VI signed the bill of approval and one year later Ferdinand II of Aragon proclaimed the Royal Mandatory Concession. Only very meagre accounts have been preserved of the practical workings of the university. From the time of its foundation the courses included Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Arabic, philosophy, mathematics, physics, theology, Canon law, and medicine. Nowadays the Polytechnic University of Valencia has become one of the most prestigious universities in Spain, according to its technology, investigation, several degrees offering a close relation with some the most important universities in the world such as Cambridge, Oxford and Harvard. Most faculties and colleges are based in the city of Valencia, with some branches in Gandia and Alcoy. Other universities are University of Alicante, Miguel Hernández University in Elche, Jaume I University and Valencian International University in Castellón de la Plana, Catholic University of Valencia, and CEU Cardenal Herrera University in Valencia. === Media === Employees demonstrate in front of the RTVV headquarters in Burjassot the day of its closure. Until its dissolution on November 2013, the public-service Ràdio Televisió Valenciana (RTVV) was the main broadcaster of radio and television in the Valencian Community. The Generalitat Valenciana constituted it in 1984 in order to guarantee the freedom of information of the Valencian people in their own language. Prior to its dissolution, the administration of RTVV under the People's Party (PP) had been controversial due to accusations of ideological manipulation and lack of plurality. The news broadcast was accused of giving marginal coverage of the Valencia Metro derailment in 2006 and the indictment of President de la Generalitat Francisco Camps in the Gürtel scandal in 2009. Supervisors appointed by the PP were accused of sexual harassment. In face of an increasing debt and shrinking audiences that had fallen under 10 and even 5% of share in recent years, RTVV announced in 2012 a plan to shed 70% of its labour. The plan was nullified on 5 November 2013 by the National Court after trade unions appealed against it. On that same day, the President de la Generalitat Alberto Fabra announced RTVV would be closed, claiming that reinstating the employees was untenable. On 27 November, the legislative assembly passed the dissolution of RTVV and employees organized to take control of the broadcast, starting a campaign against the PP. Nou TV's last broadcast ended abruptly when Spanish police pulled the plug at 12:19 on 29 November 2013. Having lost all revenues from advertisements and facing high costs from the termination of hundreds of contracts, critics question whether the closure of RTVV has improved the financial situation of the Generalitat, and point out to plans to benefit private-owned media. Currently, the availability of media in the Valencian language is extremely limited. All the other autonomous communities in Spain, including the monolingual ones, have public-service broadcasters, with the Valencian Community being the only exception despite being the fourth most populated. In 2016 the renewed Valencian government announced that a new public media corporation was to be created. The Valencian Media Corporation was founded on July 2016, as it started the creation of a new TV channel and radio station, by the name of À Punt. On June 2018 the new public TV channel was launched by Valencian Media Corporation, the newly formed agency of the Generalitat Valenciana. == Culture  Gastronomy === Valencian paella The Valencian gastronomy is of great variety, although their more international dishes are rice-based (arròs in Valencian), like the Valencian paella known worldwide. Rice is a basic ingredient in many of the typical dishes, like the arròs negre, arròs amb costra, arròs a banda, arròs a la pedra, arròs caldós, among many. The Valencian Mediterranean climate favors the cultivation of vegetables and citrus fruits, with the cultivation of the orange being perhaps of highest importance as one of the typical fruits of Valencian agriculture. Horchata (orxata in Valencian), production of which has traditionally been centred around Alboraya (Alboraia), is a typical drink, accompanied with fartons. Also traditional are the production of coffee liqueur (typical of Alcoy), and mistela (in Marina Baixa and Hoya de Buñol (Foia de Bunyol)). Another one is Agua de Valencia, in Valencian Aigua de València, it is a cocktail made from a base of cava or champagne, orange juice, vodka, and gin. In general, it is served in pitchers of various sizes and is drunk in a broad cocktail glass. It was made for the first time in 1959 by Constante Gil in the bar Café Madrid, in the city of Valencia. The great majority of desserts typical of Valencia have their origin in Arabic times and play an important part in the local festive activities. Some are internationally famous. Xixona is the place of traditional manufacture of turrón, torró in Valencian (a soft nougat), consumed during Christmas in Spain and the rest of the Hispanic world. In Casinos the turrón is typical too but the most important manufacture of the village is peladillas (dragées and sugared almonds). In Xàtiva, the arnadí, a dessert elaborated with pumpkin is made. Orihuela and its region have the almojábanas. === Valencian symbols === Valencian coat of arms over the entrance of Serranos Towers Reial Senyera, Valencian flag The official Valencian anthem is the Hymn of the Regional Exhibition of 1909 (Himne de l'Exposició Regional de 1909 in Valencian; commonly known as the Himne de València, \\"Anthem of Valencia\\"), in whose composition the old hymn of the City of Valencia of the 16th century is included. The emblem of the Valencian Generalitat (coat of arms) includes the heraldry of King Peter IV of Aragon, representative of the historical Kingdom of Valencia, whose shield is inclined towards the right, or, four bars Gules. The official flag, the Royal Senyera (Reial Senyera), also known as Senyera Coronada (Crowned Senyera) or Senyera Tricolor (Tricolour Senyera) is the same as Valencia's City flag, which, in turn, is a historical derivation of the Senyera, the heraldic symbol of the Crown of Aragon, also used today with few variations in all the former Kingdoms and Counties which were a part of this crown. There are also a number of Valencian private and civil entities such as trade unions,See logo of one of major trade unions: CCOO-PV cultural associations,See usage of the Senyera by a Valencian cultural association: ACPV or political partiesSee usage of Senyera by political parties EUPV, Bloc Nacionalista Valencià, Green Parties, amongst others, whose combined participation in the Autonomous Elections of 2007 achieved 9% of the total votes. which simply use the Senyera as Valencian flag. Other symbols are used at different levels by the Valencian society, like the heraldic animals of rat-penat (a bat) and drac alat (a winged dragon which was the emblem of James I). One of the most recognised and representative valencian symbols are the music and dance of the Muixeranga, ancient tradition of human towers preserved for the last 4 centuries, during the Festivity of 'La Mare de Déu de la Salut Festival' of Algemesí, recognized-UNESCO \\"intangible heritage of humanity\\". Typical folk music in celebrations is played with the tabalet (a drum) and the dolçaina (a flute). Valencian traditional costumes and dresses include espardenyes (shoes) and traditional fallera dresses (the Falles dresses). Valencian pilota match === Celebrations === * Moors and Christians of Alcoy * Falles * Bonfires of Saint John * Mystery Play of Elche * Muixeranga * Moros y cristianos * Tomatina * Festes de la Magdalena ==Sports== The autochthonous Valencian sport is the Valencian pilota, which features a professional Valencian Pilota Squad for international matches with related ball games all around the world. This sport has many variants, that may be played at the streets or at special courtfields like the trinquet. It may also be played by teams or on individual challenges. An amazing trait of this sport is that spectators may sit very close or even in the middle of the court. Even while the match is ongoing bookmakers take bets for reds or blues, since these are the colours players must wear, red being the colour of the strongest team or player. The Valencian pilota can be traced to the 15th century, but it was abandoned during modern times, this decadence is being fought back with TV broadcasts, new built colleges have courtfields and a new professional players firm, ValNet Association football is the most widely known and played sport. There are teams in every town or village, four of which are currently playing in La Liga, Spanish top professional division: Valencia CF (widely considered one of the most successful clubs in Spanish football history, having won six La Liga titles and 8 Copa del Rey), Villarreal CF, Levante UD and Elche CF. Other historical teams that have been in La Liga in the past are CD Alcoyano, Hércules CF and CD Castellón. Professional basketball is represented currently in Liga ACB, the top professional division, by Valencia Basket, who won its first league title in 2017. Two more teams, CB Lucentum Alicante and AB Castelló are present in the second division. Regarding female professional sports, the historical BM Sagunto, now disbanded, dominated the women's professional handball scene in Spain through the 1980s and 1990s, with a total of 27 División de Honor Femenina de Balonmano wins, 20 Cup titles and 1 Women's EHF Champions League. Other important women's handball teams are CB Amadeo Tortajada (dissolved in 2009), CBF Elda, CB Mar Alicante and CB Elche. In female basketball, Ros Casares Valencia has been 8 times champion of the Spanish Women's League and 3 times winner of the EuroLeague Women. Motorcycle races are very popular, as the Circuit of Valencia race track and its hosted Valencian Community Grand Prix prove. Many Valencian MotoGP pilots such as Héctor Barberá, Héctor Faubel or Nicolás Terol have been competing in different MotoGP classes. Another relevant game is the pigeon sport, with an autochthonous dove race being trained, the gavatxut valencià. Petanca and its variant Calitx are traditional sports as well, especially in towns or among elders. ==Image gallery== File:Alcoi vista aèria.jpgAlcoy File:Altea3.jpgAltea File:Alzira.jpgAlzira File:Cala de Finestrat 2006.JPGFinestrat File:Calp Beach - panoramio (1).jpgRock of Ifac in Calp File:Altamira Elche 01.JPGAltamira Palace, Elche File:Palmeral de Elche 07.JPGElche palm grove File:CastilloElda restauracion.jpgElda File:Estança del Duc 1.jpgGandia File:Vall de Uxó.Iglesia del Santo Ángel Custodio.jpgLa Vall d'Uixó File:06 Capella de la Comunió i església de l'Assumpció.jpgOnda File:La Vila d'Ontinyent.jpgOntinyent File:Paterna.

Almost all of the Germanic Trias was deposited during the Triassic period and consists of three clearly different units: Buntsandstein, Muschelkalk and Keuper, that gave the period its name (Triassic means \\"threefold\\"). In the past the names of these three units were also used as units in the geologic timescale, but in modern literature they only have a lithostratigraphic meaning. ==Origin== The Germanic Trias formed in the large Germanic Basin, a basin that covered much of midwestern Europe (including the south of the North Sea and Baltic Sea) during the Triassic. The Muschelkalk has a predominantly marine facies whereas the Buntsandstein and Keuper are mostly continental. ==Stratigraphy== In the central parts of the Germanic Basin, the Germanic Trias has an average thickness of 800 meters, but regional differences are considerable. In the north of Germany the thickness of the Buntsandstein alone can exceed 1400 meters. The Germanic Trias lies on top of the Permian Zechstein Group and below Lower Jurassic units, such as the Lias Group or Altena Group. The base is not defined in the same way everywhere. In northern Germany the base is formed by the Calvörde Beds, in the Spessart and Odenwald by the base of the Heigenbrücken-Sandstone. Radiometric dating has shown the age of the Germanic Trias is not totally corresponding with the Triassic period. The base of the Buntsandstein was formed during the Changhsingian, the uppermost stage of the Permian, about . The top of the Keuper is Rhaetian in age and at about at least a few million years older than the Triassic-Jurassic boundary. Usually there is a stratigraphic hiatus between the base of the Lias and top of the Germanic Trias. In German lithostratigraphy, Buntsandstein, Muschelkalk and Keuper are seen as groups. Dutch lithostratigraphy divides the Germanic Trias along other boundaries in a Lower Germanic Trias Group and an Upper Germanic Trias Group. The Dutch Keuper and Muschelkalk have the status of formations while the Dutch Buntsandstein is subdivided in a number of formations. The Bunter of British stratigraphy is similar in age, lithology and facies to the Buntsandstein. ==See also== *Geology of Germany ==References== Category:Permian Europe Category:Triassic Europe Category:Geology of Germany Category:Lithostratigraphy of Germany Category:North Sea ","title":"Germanic Trias"},{"id":"20514240","text":"Memento Mori is a novel by Scottish author Muriel Spark published by Macmillan in 1959. The title translates to \\"Remember you must die\\", which is the message delivered by a series of insidious phonecalls made to the elderly Dame Lettie Colston and her acquaintances. Who is making the calls and why? The recipients reflect on their past lives while they try to identify the culprit. ==Plot== The plot revolves around a circle of elderly upper-class Britons and their acquaintances, with a third-person omniscient narrator following multiple individuals. The centre of the group is Dame Lettie Colston, OBE, a former \\"committee member\\" who has retired from extensive work in prison reform. Other major characters include her brother Godfrey, the heir to and retired head of a brewing company; Godfrey's wife Charmian, a successful novelist; and Charmian's former maid Jean Taylor, who is now in a public nursing home. The plot is ostensibly driven by phonecalls that Dame Lettie receives in which she is civilly told: \\"Remember you must die.\\" The caller seems to be able to track her whereabouts. It gradually emerges that all the Colstons and their elderly acquaintances are receiving these calls, although each individual has a different experience of the caller: some describe him as young, others as foreign, others as old. Inspector Mortimer, a retired policeman asked to consult on the case, hears the message from a woman. Each individual also has a different reaction to the message, ranging from paranoia (Lettie) to anger (Godfrey) to acceptance (Charmian). The caller is never identified nor caught, despite a police investigation, and Mortimer and Jean Taylor believe that it is Death itself. Another major plot element involves the estate of Lisa Brooke, a woman who has had an affair with Godfrey, competed with Charmian over a man named Guy Leet, and forced Leet to marry her, but who dies of natural causes early in the novel. Her death causes a succession dispute between her (secret) husband Guy Leet, who is crippled with arthritis and walks with two sticks, Lisa's siblings the Sidebottomes, and Lisa's longtime housekeeper, Mrs Pettigrew, who has a will in her favour made under dubious circumstances. After Lisa's death Mrs Pettigrew goes to care for the partially senile Charmian, who has suffered a stroke, blackmails Godfrey with his past infidelities, and comes to dominate Charmian, threatening to poison her. It is shown late in the novel that Lisa Brooke had in fact married an Irishman, Matthew O'Brien, who has been committed to an asylum most of his life under the delusion that he is God. Since that renders Leet's marriage to Brooke null and void, on O'Brien's death in the asylum the estate passes to Mrs Pettigrew. Many of the interrelated actions of the group are chronicled by the retired sociologist Alec Warner, who has been in the past romantically involved with Jean Taylor and Lettie Colston. Warner undertakes a massive ten-year study on gerontology, and takes copious notes on all the events he observes, including the \\"threatening\\" telephone message, but he loses them all in a fire at his flat and \\"feels dead\\" from regret over their loss. Alec regularly visits Jean Taylor, whose presence in a nursing home with numerous \\"Grannies\\" and other geriatric cases provides a sane perspective on ageing in an institution. Lettie Colston loses her housekeeper Gwen to her growing paranoia, disconnects her phone, and falls victim to a home invasion planned on information unwittingly and indirectly obtained from Gwen. Lettie is bludgeoned to death with her own stick. The novel concludes with the deaths of almost all the major characters, as well as a description of the twilight years of surviving individuals. ==Television adaptation== It was adapted for television in 1992 by the BBC, directed by Jack Clayton and starring Maggie Smith, Thora Hird, Michael Hordern, Stephanie Cole and Zoë Wanamaker.

Dabba has installed several wireless routers that relay signals to an internet connection in a local community centre. Anyone within range of one of the routers can make phone calls using a Wi-Fi or SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) telephone. Calls within the network are free, and Dabba supports low-cost prepaid calls to telephones on other networks. However, the phones average about $100 each and it takes significant technical knowledge and investment to build a network like this, so the model may not work in poorer rural communities. Dabba is now working with the Shuttleworth Foundation, a non-profit South African charitable organization, in the Village telco project to develop an affordable and easy-to-install telephone system for rural communities. The goal was to design a system costing no more than US$5000 to get started, which a small-scale local entrepreneur could afford, and which would break even within six months. The project came up with the concept of a \\"mesh potato\\", a cheap device (perhaps $60 per unit) that can connect a standard analog telephone to the wireless network and also serves as a wireless mesh node, relaying signals from other mesh potatoes to a central wireless internet connection. Dabba (and other companies with a similar model) will provide advice to wireless community network owners and connectivity to the outside world.

The stone abbey church still remains in ruins. It was 24 meters long and had a nave, choir, and apse in the Romanesque style. Bishop Absalon of Roskilde, determined to obtain a new Augustinian superior, sent for his friend, Abbot William (Abbed Vilhelm) abbey of Sainte-Geneviève in Paris. When Abbot William arrived in 1165 with three French canons there were only six religious left at Eskilsø, two of whom were dismissed when they refused to submit to the new rule. In 1167 the abbey moved to Æbelholt in Tjæreby, supported by a donation of land from Absalon in Tjæreby Parish and endowed with several income-producing farms, tithes from many north Zealand churches, and several mills. The monastery on Eskilsø was closed. The first church and abbey at Æbelholt were made of timber. Construction began almost immediately on a new abbey church of limestone which was completed in 1210. Abbot William experienced considerable initial difficulties. The three French canons returned to Paris, finding conditions in Denmark too bleak. A few of the Danish canons plotted to murder him when he ordered that they eat \\"herbs and leaves\\" instead of their usual meals. Eventually William's piety, fairness, wisdom, and intelligence won them and the local populace over. He was considered a saint in his own lifetime. He was highly regarded by several kings of Denmark and served as an intermediary between the Pope and the Danish monarchy. Abbot William died on 6 April 1203 at the age of 75. Miracles at his grave and in connection with his relics brought pilgrims in great numbers, and the abbey developed into the greatest Augustinian house in the north. By 1210 the list of miracles and signs recorded was so great that Anders Sunesen, Archbishop of Lund, petitioned Pope Honorius III for his canonization. In 1219 the pope authorized several bishops to investigate the claims with an eye to making William a saint. Abbot William was canonized in 1224 as St. Vilhelm. On 16 June 1238 with great ceremony William's body was translated to lie inside the high altar in the new abbey church. A small separate chapel was constructed over his previous grave, so pilgrims could visit without disturbing the monks. In time, relics of St. Vilhelm were given to Roskilde Cathedral, Lund Cathedral, the Church of Our Lady (Vor Frue Kirke) and Greyfriars Church in Copenhagen, and Greyfriars Church in Roskilde. ===Later history=== By 1230, the monastery housed 25 canons regular, but fed about 100 persons daily. This wide hospitality was funded, as were the abbey's other expenditures, by the revenues of its estates, situated locally and also in Copenhagen and in Halland, and from the dues from the nearby market. Augustinians were interested in farming and improving crops. They hired lay brothers to do the farm work and oversee the temporal affairs of the abbey. The abbey complex consisted of a quadrangular set of buildings with the church as the north range, round a central cloister and cloister garth. The buildings were constructed of brick, the most common building material at the time. One of the most unusual parts of the abbey was the lavatory which had running water from a ditch, on which it is possible a mill also stood. The church was expanded before 1324 with a longer nave, a crossing, and choir with an apse. Several side chapels were added dedicated to the Virgin Mary, Saint John the Baptist, Saint John the Evangelist and Saint George. The high altar was dedicated to Saint Thomas. ===Reformation in Denmark=== After the Reformation in 1535, all religious houses and their income properties reverted to the crown. The abbey church was converted to the large parish church for Tjæreby and Alsønderup Parishes, while the conventual and service buildings were granted as a fief to Kristoffer Throndsen in 1544, with the provision that he should maintain the last remaining canons under Abbot Anders Ibsen. The abbey was formally dissolved in 1560; Abbot Ibsen was sent to the Carmelite priory in Helsingør where he died a year later. In 1555 the parishioners complained that the abbey church was too big to maintain, and the royal order to demolish the entire abbey complex was given in 1561. The parish churches at Tjæreby and Alsønderup were spared. Much of the stone and brick was reused to construct the nearby Frederiksborg Castle. ==Recent history== The site was excavated in the 1930s and 1950s, and the finds are now displayed in the Æbelholt Abbey Museum (Æbelholt Klostermuseum). The outlines of the abbey church and complex have been exposed, as have the pillars from the refectory. Some of the many skeletons discovered during the excavations are on display and provide much information on historical illnesses and medical treatments. === Monastery garden === A monastic garden was made here in 1957 as a reconstruction of the famous garden at the Abbey of St. Gall in Switzerland. The garden contains over a hundred medicinal plants known to have grown in such gardens in Denmark in the Middle Ages. Hillerød Folk Museum (Hillerød Bymuseum) has published a little volume entitled Æbelholt Klosterhave af Kirsten Baunegaard describing the herbs and medicinal plants in the garden. === Æbelholt Abbey Market === Almost from the time the abbey was established here a market has been held alongside. Formerly the market lasted for 14 days. The market is now under the auspices of Hillerød Folk Museum which has arranged it annually since 1998; it now lasts for a weekend. ==ReferencesOther sources== * Garner, H.N.

Coloured drawing by A.J.E. Terzi, ca 1919. The Congo floor maggot (Auchmeromyia senegalensis) is a species of blow-fly that is native to sub Saharan Africa and the Cape Verde Islands. A. sengalensis is an atypical myiasis species which does not live on or in the host, but sucks the blood of burrow-dwelling wild pigs, warthogs, aardvark, hyena and occasionally sleeping humans (sanguinivorous myiasis). Auchmeromyia is the only known genus of blood sucking maggot to feed on mammals although others feed on birds. There are five described species in the genus. Female flies lay their eggs on dry earth or the earthen floors of huts. Larvae feed for about twenty minutes, sometimes daily, and then fall to the ground. There are three larval instars and pupation lasts two weeks. The entire life cycle takes ten weeks and is continuous throughout the year. Fully grown maggots are 18 mm long. Male flies have an exceptionally long second segment and widely separated eyes. Whilst causing irritation and swelling Congo floor maggots are not known to transmit disease. Bites are easily avoided by providing beds. ==References== *Goddard,J., 2007 Physician's Guide to Arthropods of Medical Importance Fifth Edition, 2007 Category:Calliphoridae Category:Insects of Africa Category:Insects described in 1851 Category:Parasitic arthropods of mammals Category:Taxa named by Pierre-Justin-Marie Macquart ","title":"Congo floor maggot"},{"id":"20514331","text":"Defension Secunda was a 1654 political tract by John Milton, a sequel to his Defensio pro Populo Anglicano. It is a defence of the Parliamentary regime, by then controlled by Oliver Cromwell; and also defense of his own reputation against a royalist tract published under the name Salmasius in 1652, and others criticism lodged against him. ==Background== Only a few months after Cromwell was made Lord Protector over England, Milton published a tract titled Pro Populo Anglicano Defensio Secunda. The work was one of the last times that Milton discussed Cromwell's character.Keeble 2003 p. 134 It is a defence of the Parliamentary regime, controlled by Cromwell, and sought the support of a European audience.Wootton 1994 p. 75 In addition to this purpose, the work serves a reply to the attacks on his Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce by Herbert PalmerWheeler 2003 p. 134 and attacks on his Defensio pro Populo Anglicano by Salmasius. A further anonymous pamphlet attack from the royalist side, Regii sanguinis clamor ad coelum, he rebutted with an ad hominem attack on Alexander Morus, whom Milton wrongly took to be the actual author (who was in fact Pierre Du Moulin). Milton used scurrilous gossip against Morus; scholars have decided that his sources of scandal were at least reasonably accurate.Christopher Hill, Milton and the English Revolution (1977), p. 183. However, the act of writing further strained his failing eyes, to the extent that he could no longer rely on his sight.Rumrich 2003 p. 154 ==Tract== Milton begins his work by addressing claiming to fight for truth and freedom who will help reform Europe: :\\"I have in the First Defence spoken out and shall in the Second speak again to the entire assembly and council of all the most influential men, cities, and nations everywhere\\".Milton 1966 p. 554 He continues by discussing parts of his life, and explains why he writes instead of fighting as a soldier:Lares 2001 p. 36 :\\"I did not avoid the toils and dangers of military service without rendering to my fellow citizens another kind of service that was much more useful and no less perilous\\". After defending why he writes, Milton explains his purpose in writing: > It is the renewed cultivation of freedom and civic life that I disseminate > throughout cities, kingdoms, and nations. But not entirely unknown, nor > perhaps unwelcome, shall I return if I am he who disposed of the contentious > satellite of tyrants, hitherto deemed unconquerable, both in the view of > most men and in his own opinion. When he with insults was attacking us and > our battle array, and our leaders looked first of all to me, I met him in > single combat and plunged into his reviling throat this pen, the weapon of > his choice.Milton 1966 p. 556 After Milton was accused of being a worse person than Cromwell, he wrote in the work that it was \\"the highest praise you could bestow on me\\".Milton 1966 p. 662 Later in the tract, Milton discusses his Areopagitica and argues that in the work, he warns against the idea of truth being determined by a limited few. Milton also discusses his early divorce tracts, claiming that they were a discussion of religious freedom, domestic freedom, and civil freedom,Patterson 2003 p. 279 the \\"three varieties of liberty without which civilized life is scarcely possible\\".Milton 1966 p. 624 ==Themes== Milton, through the work, becomes a defender of the individual against the control of a government or religious authority. He also attacks the concept of titles and other forms of pomp, a theme that reoccurs later in the figure of Satan from his Paradise Lost.Loewenstein 2003 p. 354 Besides discussing his views on politics, Milton dwells on parts of his biography, including a description of his early years with education and literature.Lares 2001 p. 23 ==NotesReferences== * Keeble, N.

Imported liquified natural gas (LNG) from Algeria was regasified at the Canvey terminal and supplied to the pipeline, this provided eight of the twelve area gas boards with access to natural gas. The gas was initially used to manufacture town gas, either as a feedstock in gas reforming processes or to enrich lean gases such as that produced by the Lurgi coal gasification process. The pipeline was 18-inch (460 mm) in diameter and operated at 1,000 pounds per square inch (69 bar). The pipeline had 150 miles (240 km) of spur lines, supplying gas to area boards. {  +Methane pipeline spur lines !Area board !Supply to !Diameter (inches) !Length (miles) -  rowspan=\\"3\\" North Thames Bromley/East Greenwich 'Tee' 14 15.5 - Bromley 10 2.5 - Slough (from Reading spur line)   - South Eastern East Greenwich 12 3 - Southern Reading 8 49 -  rowspan=\\"2\\" Eastern Hitchin 8 7 - Dunstable 6 8.5 - West Midlands Coleshill 14 10.5 - East Midlands Sheffield 12 10 - North Western Manchester 14 24 - North Eastern Leeds 12 8 } The Gas Council was responsible for this £10 million co-operative scheme and the construction details were a joint effort of the distribution engineers of the area boards. LNG had first been imported to Canvey from Louisiana in February 1959 and piped to Romford gas works as feedstock to a reforming plant. === UK natural gas === Natural gas was discovered on the UK continental shelf in 1965 and production started in 1967. The development of offshore natural gas fields is shown in the following table. Shore terminals were built to receive, process, blend and distribute the gas. {  +UK sources of offshore natural gas, 1967-1985 !Field !Field type !Licensee or operator !Discovered !First gas onshore !Shore terminal - West Sole Gas BP September 1965 March 1967 Easington - Leman Gas Shell/Esso, Amoco/Gas Council, Arpet Group, Mobil April 1966 August 1968 Bacton - Hewett Gas Phillips Petroleum, Arpet group October 1966 July 1969 Bacton - Indefatigable Gas Shell/Esso, Amoco/Gas Council June 1966 October 1971 Bacton - Viking Gas Conoco/BNOC May 1968 July 1972 Viking (Theddlethorpe) - Rough Gas Amoco/Gas Council May 1968 October 1975 Easington - Forties Oil + associated gas BP October 1970 September 1977 St Fergus - Frigg (Norway) Gas Elf/Total June 1971 September 1977 St Fergus - Frigg (UK) Gas Elf/Total May 1972 September 1977 St Fergus - Piper Oil + associated gas Occidental group January 1973 November 1978 St Fergus - Tartan Oil + associated gas Texaco December 1974 January 1981 St Fergus - Brent Oil + associated gas Shell/Esso July 1971 1982 St Fergus - Morecambe Bay Gas + condensate Hydrocarbons (GB) September 1974 1985 Barrow } With the assured availability of natural gas a government white paper on fuel policyFuel Policy, Cmnd. 3438, HMSO, London (1967). in November 1967 proposed that natural gas should be immediately and more extensively exploited. The Gas Council and area boards began a ten-year programme to convert all users and appliances to operate on natural gas and consequently to discontinue the manufacture of town gas at local gasworks. In a pilot scheme users on Canvey Island had been converted to natural gas in 1966. === Building the NTS === To exploit the availability of natural gas and to provide for more widespread distribution construction began of a major new transmission network which became the National Transmission System (NTS).John Ellis 'The Origins and Growth of the British Gas Plant Operations Department', 2014.  Feeder pipelines - England  Gas from the West Sole field was first dispatched from the Easington terminal in July 1967, via Feeder No. 1 across the Humber to the East Midland Gas Board's gasworks at Killingholme. It was used to enrich low calorific value manufactured gas. Feeder No. 1 was extended to Totley near Sheffield where it connected to the 18-inch methane pipeline, UK natural gas first entered the NTS in July 1968. Feeder lines from the North Sea gas terminals to the spine of the NTS were laid and brought into use as the shore terminals were constructed. {  +Initial feeder pipelines of the NTS !Feeder No. !Diameter !Length !From !To !Operational - 1 24-inch (600 mm) 90 miles (144 km) Easington terminal Scunthorpe and Totley near Sheffield, where it connected to the original methane pipeline.

Feeder pipelines – Scotland  North Sea gas first reached Scotland in Spring 1970 at Coldstream, this was via an extension of the Leeds-Newcastle pipeline. This pipeline was then extended to Glenmavis near Coatbridge Lanarkshire (Feeder No. 12) where a natural gas liquification plant was constructed. A major set of pipelines were constructed in Scotland in preparation for arrival of gas from the Frigg gas field in 1977. From the St Fergus terminal in Scotland, two 36-inch (900 mm) pipelines (Feeder No. 10 and No. 11) were laid via Bathgate to Partington and Bishop Auckland to connect to the NTS in England, a total pipeline length of 595 miles (950 km). These lines were commissioned in 1976 and cost £140 million. Initially these pipelines carried gas from southern England into Scotland until the Frigg field began production via St Fergus in September 1977. Compressor stations are provided at 40 mile (65 km) intervals along the pipelines. A third 36-inch pipeline from St Fergus (Feeder No. 12) was completed in 1978, and a fourth 40-inch (1050 mm) pipeline (Feeder No. 13) in 1982. === Growth of the NTS === The NTS was extended from Leeds to Newcastle upon Tyne in early 1969. This line was extended to Coldstream in Spring 1970 and then to Glenmavis near Coatbridge Lanarkshire. The Wales Gas Board received natural gas supplies in 1969 from a 24-inch line from Churchover (Rugby) to Swansea via Wormington (an extension to Feeder No. 2). North Wales was also connected in 1969 via a 24-inch/18-inch pipeline from Audley Cheshire to Maelor near Wrexham (an extension to Feeder No. 4). The South Western Gas Board received natural gas at the end of 1970 from a 24-inch/20-inch pipeline from Wormington to Exeter (Feeder No. 14). A 30-inch/24-inch extension of Feeder No. 3 runs to the west of London via Slough to Mogador Surrey and was commissioned in 1970. An extension of the Feeder No. 5 runs from Horndon-on-the Hill, crosses the Thames at Tilbury and runs via Shorne to connect to Mogador, thus completing the South London ring main, this became operational in early 1972. In addition to these distribution pipelines in 1971 the area boards began to supply natural gas directly to major consumers. For example, a 24-inch 17 mile 'spine' pipeline was constructed to ICI Ltd at Billingham (designated as part of Feeder No. 6), and the West Midlands Gas Board laid six similar 'spine' mains into industrial districts of Birmingham and the Black Country. Most of the NTS was built from the late 1960s to the early 1980s, the growth of the system is shown in the following table. {  +Growth of the NTS 1966–1983 !Years !NTS mileage !Operational Gas Terminals !Compressor stations - 1966/7 320 Canvey 0 - 1968/9 688 Canvey Easington Bacton 0 - 1970/1 1898 Canvey Easington Bacton 1 - 1972/3 2199 Canvey Easington Bacton Theddlethorpe 4 - 1974/5 2308 Canvey Easington Bacton Theddlethorpe 9 - 1976/7 2915 Canvey Easington Bacton Theddlethorpe St. Fergus 10 - 1978/9 3047 Canvey Easington Bacton Theddlethorpe St. Fergus 11 - 1983 3200 Canvey Easington Bacton Theddlethorpe St. Fergus 14 } Later (post-1983) feeder mains not described above include. {  +NTS Feeder pipelines built after 1983 !Feeder No. !From !To !Year commissioned - 9 Easington East Ilsley 1983-86 - 15 Longtown Warburton 1984 - 16 Barrow Lupton 1983 - 17 Theddlethorpe Hatton 1988 -  rowspan=\\"3\\" 18 Peterborough Cambridge 1988–94 - Isle of Grain Gravesend 2008 - Matching Green Tilbury 1990 - 19 Easington Paull 1991 - 20 Ilchester Choakford 1989 -  rowspan=\\"3\\" 21 Mawdesley Alrewas 1992–2001 - Carnforth Burscough 1992 - Elworth Deeside power station 1994 - 22 Goxhill Peterborough 1993 -  rowspan=\\"3\\" 23 Churchover Honeybourne 1998-2001 - Peterstow Gilwern 2000 - Wormington Corse 2000 -  rowspan=\\"3\\" 24 St Fergus Lochside 2001 - Easington Paull 2010 - Hatton Silk Willoughby 2001 - 25 Bridge Farm Mickle Trafford 2001 - 26 Huntingdon Steppingley 2001 -  rowspan=\\"2\\" 27 Bacton King's Lynn 2003 - Cambridge Matching Green 2002 - 28 Herbrandston Corse 2007 - 29 Easington Nether Kellett 2006–08 } The NTS now comprises over 7,600 km of welded steel gas pipelines. The Canvey to Leeds line is no longer part of the NTS. === LNG storage sites === In addition to the Canvey Island Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) import terminal, further NGL storage sites were constructed from the late 1960s. These were peak-shaving facilities used to support the NTS at times of high demand, and to ensure security of gas supplies at strategic locations. When demand was high liquefied natural gas was pumped from storage tanks, heated in vapourisers to a gaseous state and delivered into the NTS. When demand was low, gas was withdrawn from the NTS and liquefied by cryogenic cooling to minus 162 °C to replenish the storage tanks. {  +NTS Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Sites.

See Grain LNG Terminal } === High-pressure gas storage === In addition to LNG storage for peak-shaving, several sites had storage facilities for high pressure gas that could be released into, and pressurised from, the NTS. The following sites were operational by 1972. * Isle of Grain, six 'bullets', 12 ft (3.6 m) diameter, 250 ft (76.2 m) long, capacity 8 million cubic feet (226,000 m3) of gas, operating at up to 1,000 psi (69 bar). * Beckton gas works, eight 'bullets', 13.5 ft (4.1 m) diameter, 263 ft (80.1 m) long, capacity 5 million cubic feet (142,000 m3) of gas, pressure cycle 350-100 psi (24-6.9 bar). * South Western Gas Board, for Bristol and Cheltenham, eleven ‘bullets’, 13 ft 6 in (4.1 m) diameter, 311 ft 8 in (95 m) long, total capacity 13 million cubic feet (368,000 m3), pressure cycle 450-40 psi (31-2.76 bar). * Biggin Hill Kent, seventeen, 42-inch (1.07 m) diameter buried pipes, 1,040 ft (317 m) long, capacity 10 million cubic feet (283,000 m3), operating up to 1,000 psi (69 bar). ==Operation== NTS is the starting point for UK gas distribution. The pipeline system for houses is not part of the NTS, but is part of the gas distribution network of local distribution zones; the two systems combine to form the UK's gas distribution network. The two types of gas pipelines in the UK are: large diameter high-pressure (up to 85 bar and 1050 mm diameter) pipelines – the type that the NTS uses, and smaller diameter lower pressure pipelines that connect to users who burn gas for heat. The wall thickness of the high-pressure pipelines is up to 0.625-inches (18mm). ===Entry=== Gas currently enters the NTS from a number of sources: * Offshore oil and gas fields on the UK continental shelf. These deliver gas via five (formerly six) UK coastal gas terminals (five in England: CATS Teesside; Easington/Dimlington; Bacton; Rampside Barrow and the former Theddlethorpe terminal and one in Scotland: St Fergus). Gas from the Liverpool Bay (Douglas) field formerly entered the NTS at Burton Point terminal in Cheshire, this terminal is now identified by National Grid as a NTS offtake to Connah's Quay power station. * Onshore gas fields such as Saltfleetby Lincolnshire (production was via the former Theddlethorpe terminal); and Wytch Farm Dorset. * Continental Europe. From Norway via the Langeled pipeline and the Easington terminal; from the Netherlands via the BBL pipeline; from Belgium via the Interconnector UK pipeline, both of the latter through Bacton gas terminal. * Imported LNG. Gas is delivered from import terminals at the Isle of Grain LNG; Milford Haven (South Hook and Dragon). The Canvey Island gas terminal ceased importing LNG in 1984. * Storage facilities. These include a mixture of salt cavity storage, onshore LNG storage sites, depleted onshore gas fields and the depleted offshore gas field at Rough (via Easington terminal). Storage facilities include: Holford Cheshire; Garton/Aldborough East Yorkshire; Hornsea East Yorkshire; Stublach Cheshire; Holford Cheshire; Hole House Farm Cheshire; Saltfleetby Lincolnshire; Hatfield Moor South Yorkshire; and Barton Stacey/Humbly Grove Hampshire. The NTS was formerly supplied by the following decommissioned LNG sites: Ambergate Derbyshire (closed 1985); Dynevor Arms Merthyr Tydfil (closed 2009); Glenmavis Lanarkshire (closed 2012); Partington Greater Manchester (closed 2012); and Avonmouth Bristol (closed April 2016). * A salt cavity storage facility at Hornsea, East Yorkshire. Seven cavities at a depth of 1800 m each store up to 60 million m3 of gas at a maximum pressure of 240 bar. The releasable volume of gas is about half of the gross volume. During periods of low demand gas is compressed into the cavities by electrically driven compressors and fed back onto the NTS at times of peak demand. === Gas specification and composition === The specification of gas transported within the NTS is typically within the following parameters. {  +Specification of gas in the NTS !Content or characteristic !Value - Gross calorific value 37.0 – 44.5 MJ/m3 - Wobbe number* 47.2 – 51.41 MJ/m3 - Water dewpoint <-10 °C @ 85barg - Hydrocarbon dewpoint <-2 °C - Hydrogen sulphide content* ≤5 mg/m3 - Total sulphur content (including H2S)* ≤50 mg/m3 - Hydrogen content* ≤0.1% (molar) - Oxygen content* ≤0.2% (molar) - Carbon dioxide content ≤2.0% (molar) - Nitrogen content <5.0% (molar) - Total inerts <7.0% - Incomplete combustion factor* ≤0.48 - Soot index* ≤0.60 } Parameters marked * are specified in the Gas Safety (Management) Regulations 1996. The composition of natural gas in the NTS is typically as follows. {  +Composition of natural gas !Component !Volume % - Methane 93.63 - Ethane 3.25 - Propane 0.69 - Butane 0.27 - Other hydrocarbons 0.20 - Nitrogen 1.78 - Carbon dioxide 0.13 - Helium 0.05 } === Compressor stations === There are twenty-five (mostly gas turbine driven) compressor stations and over 25 pressure regulators. Gas moves through the NTS at speeds up to 25 mph (40 km/h) depending on pressures and pipeline diameters. Compressor stations generally operate at a pressure ratio of 1:1.4, this ratio is a balance between maintaining pressure and hence flow, and the capital and running cost of the compressors. It also ensures that the temperature rise across the compressors is not high enough to require after-coolers to prevent damage to the pipeline protective coatings. On the pipelines from St Fergus, compressor stations are provided at 40 mile (65 km) intervals; each compresses the gas from about 48 bar at 5 °C to 65 bar at 45 °C. Compressor stations include: * England – Wooler, Bishop Auckland, Carnforth, Nether Kellett, Warrington, Hatton, Alrewas, Wisbech, King's Lynn, Peterborough, Churchover, Huntingdon, Cambridge, Diss, Chelmsford, Aylesbury, Lockerley and Wormington. * Scotland – Aberdeen, Avonbridge, Kirriemuir, Moffat and St Fergus. {  +Initial NTS compressor stations !Station !Gas turbines !Power rating (MW) !Commissioned - Alrewas 2 Rolls-Royce Avons 21.6 1970 - Peterborough 3 Rolls-Royce Avons 35.4 1972 - Churchover 3 Orendas 18.4 1972 - Scunthorpe 2 Rolls-Royce Avons 23.6 1973 - Chelmsford 2 Rolls-Royce Avons 23.0 1973 - King's Lynn 4 Rolls-Royce Avons 47.2 1973 - Cambridge 2 Rolls-Royce Avons 23.0 1974 - Bishop Auckland 2 Orendas 14.4 1974 - Kirriemuir 4 Rolls-Royce Avons 47.2 1977 - Bathgate 4 Rolls-Royce Avons 47.2 1977 - Diss 3 Rolls-Royce Avons 34.5 1977 - St Fergus I 4 Rolls-Royce Avons 47.2 1977 - St Fergus II 2 Rolls-Royce Maxi Avons, 3 Rolls-Royce RB211s 65.3 1978 - Moffat 2 Rolls-Royce RB211s 38.6 1980 - Wisbech 1 Rolls-Royce RB211, 1 Rolls-Royce Maxi Avon 32.6 1980 } === Offtakes === Offtakes from the NTS include those supplying industrial users, local distribution networks, storage sites and export pipelines. * Offtakes to about 71 large users such power stations and industry either those on multi-business sites such as Billingham and Runcorn or to individual companies such as INEOS Teesside. * NTS offtakes to inland storage sites (see 'Entry') and to the offshore Rough field storage site via the Easington gas terminal. * The NTS supplies the Irish interconnectors; the 24-inch 135 km Scotland-Northern Ireland Pipeline (SNIP) to Ballylumford Northern Ireland and the two 24-inch UK-Eire Interconnectors to Dublin, they are supplied from an NTS offtake at Moffat. Gas can also be exported to Belgium and the Netherlands via the Interconnector UK and the BBL pipelines both via the Bacton terminal. * Offtakes to the Gas Distribution Network of Local Distribution Zones. {  +NTS Gas Distribution Network offtakes !National Grid area !Number of LDZ offtakes - Scotland 19 - Northern 15 - South West 13 - East Midlands 13 - West Midlands 12 - North West 11 - East Anglia 11 - North East 9 - Southern 8 - North Thames 5 - South East 5 - Wales 3 - Total 124 } ===Gas distribution network=== Companies that own part of this gas network, also known as the Local Transmission System (LTS), are known as gas transporters. Gas enters this network via the NTS through a pressure reduction station to the twelve gas distribution zones in England, Scotland and Wales within eight distribution networks. The network covers . The LTS is managed from Hinckley, Leicestershire (former headquarters of the NTS). Financial transactions between gas transporters are managed by Xoserve, based in Solihull, which was a department of National Grid before it became an independent company. For retail distribution, Cadent owns the network in North West England, the West Midlands, the East Midlands, the East of England and North London. In the North of England, local distribution is owned by Northern Gas Networks; in the Wales and West by Wales and West Utilities; and in Southern England and Scotland by SGN. ==Ownership== The transmission network is owned by National Grid Gas plc. The changing ownership of the NTS reflects developments and corporate changes in the UK's gas and energy industries. * Gas Council and area boards, 1962 – 31 December 1972 * British Gas Corporation, 1 January 1973 – 24 August 1986 * British Gas plc, 24 August 1986 – 1994 * Transco plc, part of British Gas plc, 1994 – 17 February 1997 * Transco plc, part of BG plc,17 February 1997 – 1999 * Transco plc, part of BG Group plc, 1999 – 23 October 2000 * Transco plc, part of Lattice Group plc, 23 October 2000 – 21 October 2002 * National Grid Transco plc from 21 October 2002; renamed National Grid Gas plc on 10 October 2005 ==Northern Ireland== Northern Ireland is not part of the NTS and gets its gas via the Scotland- Northern Ireland pipeline (SNIP), owned by Premier Transmission and built between 1994 and 1996. The gas network in Northern Ireland is split, with one area owned by Phoenix Natural Gas and the other by Firmus Energy. ==See also== * Rampside Gas Terminal * CATS Gas Terminal * Theddlethorpe Gas Terminal * Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem) ==References External links == * Gas Transmission System Operations * Map of the NTS at National Grid * Detailed Map of the NTS * Instantaneous gas flows into the NTS * Pipeline projects at National Grid plc * Ownership of the gas distribution network * Society of British Gas Industries (slow loading) * Energy Networks Association * Xoserve * GCSE PDF factsheet about the NTS * Origins and Growth of the British Gas Plant Operations Department (including pipeline maps) * Shell Bacton Infrastructure Information * Perenco Bacton & Dimlington Infrastructure Information * Gas Safety (Management) Regulations 1996 * Statement of Gas Transmission Transportation Charges Table 3 & 5 Category:Natural gas pipelines in the United Kingdom ","title":"National Transmission System"},{"id":"20514421","text":"Frederick Munroe Bourne (June 26, 1910 - July 11, 1992) was a Canadian swimmer who competed at the 1928, 1932 and 1936 Olympics in the 100-metre freestyle, 100-metre backstroke and 4×200-metre freestyle relay events and won a bronze medal in the relay in 1928.

She faced numerous disciplinary hearings in the past, to the point where her legal fees, paid by the province, have totaled more than $1 million. She was reprimanded after one episode in 1997 where she demanded to see the resumes of 125 youth workers she thought weren't qualified to care for children. In October, 2004 the Quebec Judicial Council noting several ethical shortcomings, recommended her dismissal as a judge. She was accused primarily of having publicly discussed matters she was legally involved with, of having hidden links of friendship with an expert witness who testified before her, and of having lent her name and used the prestige of her position in a 2002 Via Rail television advertisement. Following this recommendation in conformity with mandatory legal procedure the Quebec Government asked the Quebec Appeal Court to investigate. In December, 2005, five judges of the Quebec Court of Appeal upheld the ruling of the Quebec Judicial Council and recommended Judge Ruffo's dismissal. Andrée Ruffo asked permission to appeal this decision to the Supreme Court of Canada. In May, 2006, the Supreme Court refused to hear the appeal, which initiated the formal process of dismissal by the Quebec Attorney General. Madame Ruffo chose to resign before the dismissal was issued. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Cour d'appel: la juge Ruffo doit être destituée [archive] * (fr) Radio-Canada: la juge Ruffo perd sa cause et démissionne [archive] * (fr) Ruffo (Re), 2005 QCCA 1197 (CanLII) [archive] * Controversial Quebec judge in trouble again: Testimonial for Via Rail prompts disciplinary hearing; [Final Edition] George Kalogerakis.

P. Jayasumana, Q. Han, and T. Illangasekare, \\"Virtual sensor networks – a resource efficient approach for concurrent applications,\\" In Proc. ITNG 2007, Las Vegas, Apr. 2007. In contrast to early wireless sensor networks that were dedicated to a specific application (e.g., target tracking), VSNs enable multi-purpose, collaborative, and resource efficient WSNs. The key idea difference of VSNs is the collaboration and resource sharing. By doing so nodes achieve application objectives in a more resource efficient way. These networks may further involve dynamically varying subset of sensor nodes (e.g., when the phenomenon migrates sensors that detect the phenomenon changes with time) and/or users (users that are accessing the network changes with time). A VSN can be formed by providing logical connectivity among collaborative sensors. Nodes can be grouped into different VSNs based on the phenomenon they track (e.g., rock slides vs. animal crossing) or the task they perform. VSNs are expected to provide the protocol support for formation, usage, adaptation, and maintenance of subset of sensors collaborating on a specific task(s). Even the nodes that do not sense the particular event/phenomenon could be part of a VSN as far as they are willing to allow sensing nodes to communicate through them. Thus, VSNs make use of intermediate nodes, networks, or other VSNs to efficiently deliver messages across members of a VSN. == Applications == VSNs are useful in three major classes of applications: rock sliding and animal crossing in a mountainous retain (two applications). Each application use nodes from the other application to relay its data to the signaling systems and/or to its members. * Geographically overlapped applications :* E.g., monitoring rock slides and animal crossing within a mountainous terrain. Different types of devices that detect these phenomena can relay each other for data transfer without having to deploy separate networks. Here the advantage is saving in hardware cost. * While logically separating multi- purpose sensor networks :*E.g., smart neighborhood systems with multifunctional sensor nodes. Instead of traditional WSNs that runs one single applications, VSN enabled nodes run multiple applications * In certain dedicated but dynamic applications :* E.g., To enhance efficiency of a system that track dynamic phenomena such as subsurface chemical plumes that migrate, split, or merge. Such networks may involve dynamically varying subsets of sensors. Here the advantage is the ability to connect right set of nodes at the right time. == See also == * Khan, I.; Belqasmi, F.; Glitho, R.; Crespi, N.; Morrow, M.; Polakos, P., \\"Wireless Sensor Network Virtualization: A Survey,\\" in IEEE Communications Surveys and Tutorials, vol.18, no.1, pp. 553–576, Firstquarter 2016 doi: 10.1109/COMST.2015.2412971 * Khan, I.; Belqasmi, F.; Glitho, R.; Crespi, N.; Morrow, M.; Polakos, P., \\"Wireless sensor network virtualization: early architecture and research perspectives,\\" in IEEE Network, vol.29, no.3, pp. 104–112, May–June 2015 doi: 10.1109/MNET.2015.7113233 * Khan, I.; Errounda, F.Z.; Yangui, S.; Glitho, R.; Crespi, N., \\"Getting Virtualized Wireless Sensor Networks' IaaS Ready for PaaS,\\" in Distributed Computing in Sensor Systems (DCOSS), 2015 International Conference on, vol., no., pp. 224–229, 10–12 June 2015 doi: 10.1109/DCOSS.2015.39 * Khan, I.; Jafrin, R.; Errounda, F.Z.; Glitho, R.; Crespi, N.; Morrow, M.; Polakos, P., \\"A data annotation architecture for semantic applications in virtualized wireless sensor networks,\\" in Integrated Network Management (IM), 2015 IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on, vol., no., pp. 27–35, 11–15 May 2015 doi: 10.1109/INM.2015.7140273 * N.

He started in the music business as a guitarist touring with the psychedelic rock band Edgar Broughton Band. In 1986 he began performing as Sheriff Jack, releasing two albums of psychedelia music, Laugh Yourself Awake (1986) and What Lovely Melodies! (1987). As Lewis Taylor, he released his self-titled album in 1996, through Island Records, with tracks including \\"Bittersweet\\" and \\"Lucky\\" being released as singles. The album showcased a significant departure from psychedelia towards neo soul and was highly acclaimed. However, Lewis Taylor became \\"an album that everybody talked about but few bought\\". Taylor released his album Stoned, Part I in 2002 on his own label named Slow Reality, and followed it up in 2004 with a sequel, Stoned, Part II. Robbie Williams covered \\"Lovelight\\" from Stoned, Part 1 on his 2006 album, Rudebox. In June 2006, Lewis Taylor retired from music. As Andrew Taylor, he had since been musical director and bass player for Gnarls Barkley, and guitarist/backing vocalist for the Edgar Broughton Band and The Drivers.

She was portrayed by Emmy-nominated actress Marcia Cross for the first five seasons from 1992 to 1997. ==Casting== After her stint on Knots Landing, actress Marcia Cross landed the recurring role of Kimberly Shaw on Melrose Place. Only planned as a small part in the beginning, the character of Kimberly came more recognizable once she was believed to have died in a car accident and shocked viewers with her return. Cross became a fan favorite but refused for the longest time to sign a contract with the show. The producers finally convinced her to go on contract with the start of the fourth season in September 1995. Cross left one and a half years later, when producers refused to give her a pay raise that would bring her near the salary of co-star Heather Locklear. She last appeared in April 1997 with the character being killed off. Only one month later, co-star Laura Leighton left for the same reason as Cross. ==StorylinesSeason 1=== Kimberly first appears in the first season as a Resident Doctor at Wilshire Memorial, as a colleague of Michael Mancini; the two characters are only interns at this point. She is considered one of the top new doctors there on the fast track to a bright future. Initially, she helps Michael with whatever problems he has going on, such as marital or personal problems as a doctor. The two become friends, and she accompanies Michael to the Melrose Place Christmas party where she first meets the other residents. Later on, Alison moves out of her apartment, and Billy needs a new roommate. Michael suggests Kimberly and so she goes to look at the apartment. However, noticing Billy and Alison's issues, she decides she does not want a roommate as it means getting involved in people's day-to-day lives. Kimberly soon notices herself having feelings for Michael and soon learns he feels the same way. They begin to have an affair. Soon, they are caught out by Alison. Michael's wife, Jane, eventually also finds out and confronts Michael. He denies it but the two are then caught red handed by Jane herself. Michael agrees to stop seeing Kimberly to save his marriage but cannot deny his feelings for her. Kimberly initially also tries to end the affair as she thinks it is morally wrong but she too cannot deny her feelings. Confronted by Jane, Kimberly reveals the affair is not over and so Jane files for divorce. ===Season 2=== Kimberly and Michael move in together after she finds a beach house to rent. They are very happy together at first, but Jane's sister, Sydney, soon causes trouble as she makes her intentions for Michael very clear. She eventually seduces a drunken Michael. Michael tells Sydney it was a mistake but falls prey to her advances once more and is caught by Kimberly. Michael apologizes and begs Kimberly to forgive him. She refuses and tries to go on without him. Eventually, he convinces her to go on a date, during which he proposes marriage. She rejects his proposal initially but changes her mind on the way home. They celebrate with a kiss but a drunken Michael loses control of the car and they suffer a terrible car accident. Kimberly slips into a coma, while a grief-stricken Michael is paralyzed from the waist down. Kimberly's mother, Marion Shaw (Janet Carroll) comes to take Kimberly back to Cleveland, Ohio to be near her family after making it clear she blames Michael for the whole ordeal and for destroying Kimberly's life. Several weeks later, she informs the Wilshire staff Kimberly has died. It turns out Michael had Matt change his blood alcohol level reports after the accident to avoid jail time. Sydney soon discovers this and eventually blackmails Michael into marriage. Weeks later, Michael caves and decides to make the most of his life with Sydney, accepting defeat. While kissing on the beach house balcony, they are obviously being watched. It is soon discovered Kimberly is watching them. The next night, Michael awakens in the middle of a storm and checks out a noise in the kitchen. He is startled to see Kimberly. She reveals she was in a coma for months and that her mother lied to the hospital to keep Michael from her. Michael explains his unique situation with Sydney but Kimberly says she will take care of things. Kimberly appears different upon her return: stronger, angrier and determined. As Michael is no longer under threat of being charged with homicide, he divorces Sydney and plans to marry Kimberly once again. Kimberly soon reveals she plans to get revenge on him for what he has done to her. In the bathroom one night, she reveals a huge nasty scar underneath a wig she now wears, resulting in awful migraines. Kimberly lets Sydney in on her plan to kill Michael and they plot together on how to achieve this. After one failed attempt, Kimberly steals Jane's car and disguises herself as Jane and runs Michael down. ===Season 3=== Michael survives again and suffers amnesia. Jane is arrested but soon cleared and the evidence points to Sydney. Kimberly uses this to her advantage and frames Sydney. Sydney is arrested and charged with attempted murder. Matt begins to suspect Kimberly of the crime and Sydney informs everyone of this but Kimberly is cleared. Michael gets his memory back and realises Kimberly tried to kill him. He gives her an ultimatum: \\"either love me or kill me but make up your damn mind.\\" She decides she loves him too much and the two begin to live their life as normal again. After a trip to Las Vegas, they elope but Kimberly then learns she is barren as a result of the accident. They try to adopt but the cost and time is too much for Kimberly. After hearing of Jo's issues with her own pregnancy, Kimberly offers her a solution....fake the death of Jo's baby so that she can move to New York and raise the child herself rather than give it up to the Carters as a judge had ordered. Kimberly delivers the baby, then fills out the paperwork to make it appear Jo's child was stillborn. Jo stays in hospital to go along with the story. Kimberly goes home and attempts to breast-feed the child. When Jo comes to collect her son, Kimberly, nursing the baby, tells her it was stillborn and closes the door. Jo cannot contact the police as she was committing a crime in her attempt to keep her child. After many attempts to get her child back, Jo finally does so after informing Wilshire's Chief of Staff, Peter Burns (Jack Wagner), of the incident. Peter orders Michael to return the child or he and Kimberly will be fired. While Kimberly is at work on Christmas Day, Michael returns the baby to Jo. An enraged Kimberly tries to drown herself in the ocean, but Michael saves her. Kimberly informs the Carters of their grandson's well being in an effort to get pay back at Jo. Kimberly goes back to her plans of legally adopting a child but her obsession with having a baby drives Michael away and he begins a romance with cancer-stricken Amanda. Kimberly's attempts to end this by threatening both Amanda and Michael appear to work but Michael continues to see Amanda. He finds Kimberly in tears at home where she tells him she knows all his faults and she is the only person that will let him be true to himself. All she asks is he does not leave her. Michael assures Kimberly he never will. The doctors at Wilshire must undergo a psych evaluation, and Kimberly's evaluation reveals she is a ticking time bomb, with no threshold for dealing with stress. To prevent this from going public, she has Matt attacked so she can change her results to be more to her liking. Michael tells Kimberly he wants them to move away from all their problems in Los Angeles and so he sends Kimberly off to San Diego to look at some houses. While she's gone, he keeps Amanda in their home. Kimberly arrives home early to discover this. At the hospital, Kimberly receives a check for $100,000 from the council after Michael filed a claim citing the dangerous roads as the cause for his accident with Kimberly more than a year earlier. She informs Michael she has received the money and will put it in their joint account. Kimberly is then stunned when presented with divorce papers at work. She confronts Michael and he reveals he plans to take the money and be with Amanda. Kimberly goes home that night and leaves Michael a suicide note and takes a handful of pills. Michael finds her and dials 911, but soon hangs up as Kimberly's death will work out well for him. However Sydney arrives, forcing Michael to make the call. While there, she finds the suicide note and takes it. Kimberly tells Sydney she will pay Sydney $50,000 to swap some pills to make it look like Michael tried to kill her and find the suicide note. Sydney agrees but Michael then pays her another $50,000 for the suicide note. Michael tells Kimberly he will show it to the medical board unless she leaves the city. Kimberly agrees but informs Sydney she will pay for her deception. Kimberly attends camp \\"No More Victims\\", a popular camp for abused women to find inner and outer strength. Whilst there, she hallucinates Jane, Sydney, Amanda and Jo taunting her for her crimes against them all. Kimberly realises what she must now do to seek revenge on her enemies. She receives an early graduation after breaking the arm of the sergeant in charge of the camp. She returns to work. Michael goes through with his threat and informs the chief of staff of her suicide note. The chief of staff feels Michael is doing it for his own pleasure rather than protecting the hospital and he tells them to behave professionally at work. Kimberly informs Amanda she wants to call a truce and form an alliance against Michael (as Amanda feels Michael has begun harassing her). Amanda agrees and so Kimberly begins terrorizing Amanda, making her think it is Michael. Kimberly goes to the beach house, tears it apart and injures herself and calls the police. It appears to them Michael has attacked her and he is arrested. Kimberly goes home one night but soon sees the reflection of a demonic man in the mirror. She collapses, telling herself she isn't crazy. Michael is released on bail, put up by Peter. Michael has Sydney follow Kimberly but Sydney believes Kimberly has changed and is not up to any trouble until Sydney finds a collage of photos of herself, Michael, Matt and Amanda with their eyes cut out and blood smeared all over them at Kimberly's motel room. The police can do nothing though. Kimberly asks Peter why he bailed Michael out of jail and he then asks her on a date. They have several dates including one at a hospital function. Kimberly sees the demonic image again and he tells her to destroy her enemies. Sydney overhears Kimberly say she will kill them all. Kimberly then realises Peter still has feelings for Amanda. This is the final straw for Kimberly, as she loses someone she cares about to Amanda once again. Kimberly decides to blow up Melrose Place with all her enemies inside. Sydney tries to stop her, but Kimberly catches her. That night, everyone arrives at Melrose Place apart from Matt. Michael and Sydney manage to knock Kimberly out and attempt to clear the building but Kimberly regains consciousness and tells everyone \\"it's not what it looks like....it's worse\\". ===Season 4=== Kimberly presses the detonator and the building explodes. Surprisingly only fashion designer MacKenzie Hart is killed as collateral damage; she had gone to the complex to confront her husband Richard, who was having an affair with Jane. All others sustain injuries. Kimberly is taken to the psychiatric ward of the hospital under tough surveillance. With Peter as her doctor, she remembers nothing of the past week, refusing to believe she could do something so horrible. She manages to escape her room and attempts to jump off the roof of the hospital, saying she has nothing to live for. Peter tells her he cares about her and convinces her to come down. He then tells her she must plead insanity to avoid a life sentence. She refuses but soon agrees to fake an insanity test as with treatment she will likely be released. She fails the insanity test to their dismay. However, at a court hearing, Michael and Sydney arrive and Kimberly sees Henry again, her demonic reflection and he tells her to destroy them once and for all. She lunges at Michael and Sydney but is taken off to her cell. The judge then declares her insane. Peter initially thinks it is good acting until he realises she really is insane. Kimberly reveals her visions of Henry to Peter and he decides to call Marion Shaw to see if she knows anything. Marion comes to Los Angeles with plans to take Kimberly back to Cleveland once again but soon confesses she knows who Henry is. When Kimberly was 7, her father was away on business. Marion was in the kitchen making a cake for Kimberlys birthday. Henry, their gardener, came in and soon began to rape Marion. Kimberly saw this, picked up a knife and killed Henry. With this breakthrough, Kimberly receives treatment and is soon let out into Peter's custody. She is given a monitoring belt, ensuring she is only at Peter's or the mental institution. She is allowed go to the Melrose Place post-bomb party to apologize to everyone and go into the laundry room, where she planted much of her bombs. Michael and Sydney hire an actor who looks like Henry to torment Kimberly. It works. He follows her around. Peter says she will be re- institutionalized if she continues to claim Henry is haunting her. Kimberly soon discovers \\"Henry\\" is real and Michael and Sydney's plan to drive her back to insanity. With this, Kimberly feels she is cured. She tells Peter she wants her monitoring device gone but he has trouble getting it approved. Kimberly breaks her wrist to remove it so she can begin work as radio host. Eventually the device is legally removed and Kimberly moves into Melrose Place. Feeling lonely, Kimberly begins a string of one-night stands. An obsessed radio fan soon harasses Kimberly and kidnaps her but she breaks free and takes him to the police where he is jailed. Kimberly decides to go back to work at Wilshire where she begins work as a psychiatrist. Sydney becomes a patient of hers, where she regularly discusses Michael. Kimberly helps Sydney with her relationship with Michael though he still believes she is insane and wants to kill him. She soon begins flirting with him and eventually Michael softens to her, believing she has changed. They become friends again and hint at getting back together. She goes to him for an injection one day but he injects her with truth serum to find out a secret of Sydney's. He also asks if she wants to kill him and she says no, she loves him. When fully conscious again, Kimberly tells Michael he has ruined any trust she had restored in him and wants nothing to do with him. Kimberly's kidnapper, Vic, escapes from jail and takes her hostage once more. Michael manages to save her however and her trust in him is restored. Michael then asks her to move back into the beach house with him, confessing his love for her. Kimberly says they are bad for each other but agrees. Kimberly then receives divorce papers as the two never finalized their divorce originally. She sees it as a sign but Michael rips it up, asking her to marry him again. They renew their vows in front of their Melrose Place friends on the beach. Blissfully happy once again, upon their return from their honeymoon, Kimberly has flashbacks of the car accident. She awakens once day to see a pile of ironing done she doesn't recall doing. Days later, she is at a tupperware party, wearing wholesome clothing and calling herself Betsy. After Kimberly and Michael have sex on the sofa, \\"Betsy\\" tosses it onto the beach and sets it alight. Kimberly realizes she has a multiple personality disorder. Afraid to tell Michael for fear he will leave her, Kimberly also has reservations about telling Peter as she doesn't want to go back to the mental institution. She develops another identity, Rita. As things get out of control, Kimberly confides her secret to Peter. He agrees to help her but before he can, \\"Betsy\\" takes over and kidnaps Peter. Betsy does not want Peter to destroy her so she takes him to a mental institution out of town Betsy had recently been put in charge of, an arrangement made up through Kimberly's connections as a doctor. Betsy sees this as pay back for Peter having Kimberly in an institution months earlier. She attempts to lobotomize him. Before she can, Amanda and Michael arrive looking for Peter and Kimberly. Betsy has them locked up with Peter, revealing they will all have lobotomies. Michael tries to talk to Kimberly, telling her they have gone through too much to be together and that he loves her. Kimberly manages to break through Betsy with this, but an orderly believes Michael has brainwashed Betsy. He struggles with Michael and Kimberly intervenes, resulting in her tumbling over the railing, unconscious. At Wilshire, she is in a coma and flatlines. ===Season 5=== She stabilizes but is still in a coma. Peter is accused of murder. Kimberly is his only alibi as she was with him the night of the murder, when she told him of her mental issues. Kimberly comes to but is unable to recall her dinner with Peter. Amanda threatens to kill her if she doesn't come through for Peter. Kimberly runs away because she is afraid she can't help Peter. She returns and goes to court and says she does not remember her dinner with Peter but she does remember a waiter there who can vouch for Peter. Peter is cleared. Kimberly faces the medical board based on her/Betsy running the mental institution. Kimberly states it is obvious she is unfit to practice medicine and decides it is best she gives up her medical license. Kimberly then goes to work for Peter and Michael as their receptionist till they find a replacement. Kimberly tells Michael she has gone off sex and suggests other ways for them to be intimate. Michael is disappointed but goes along with this for Kimberly. As the weeks pass, he becomes frustrated and meets a beautiful woman, Megan, on the beach. She offers him no-strings-attached sex and he goes to her home but then declines as he loves Kimberly too much. Eventually he can't resist though. Kimberly learns from her doctor she has a brain tumor and is given three months to live. She decides not to tell Michael as he could not bear to hear the news and she fears he could not live without her. Soon enough, it is revealed Kimberly and Megan are friends. Kimberly tells Megan she is dying and wants her to be with Michael after she dies. Kimberly decides rather than tell Michael of her tumor, she will drive him away and into Megan's arms so he will have someone after Kimberly is gone. Kimberly had originally hired Megan, a prostitute, to service Michael until her sex drive returned. Megan wants to tell Michael but Kimberly refuses. Instead, she \\"catches\\" him cheating and states she wants a divorce. They finalize the divorce and Kimberly convinces Megan to marry Michael. Kimberly wants to leave Michael with life insurance money but can't get any as she is so close to death. She decides to commit suicide, disguising it as an accident so she can leave him with accidental death money. She tells Megan this but Megan tries to stop her. In order to do this, Megan tells Michael of Kimberly's tumor and all her plans. They manage to stop Kimberly but Michael is devastated to learn she is dying. Michael tells Peter he feels responsible because of the car accident three years earlier. He refuses to leave Kimberly in her final weeks. Kimberly finally accepts and decides to make the most of her time with Michael. Megan begins to feel neglected as Michael spends all his time with Kimberly. Kimberly asks Michael for one last night together and they have sex. Megan discovers this and tries to run Kimberly down but she can't. Kimberly learns her tumor is in remission and she believes it is because of Michael's love and care for her. As a result, she tries to break up Michael and Megan to get Michael back for good. She does not tell Michael of her remission, but when he discovers it, he feels betrayed and says he wants nothing to do with her. Later, Kimberly hires Megan's former pimp Josh to get Megan to end her marriage to Michael as well her returning to prostitution. However, this doesn't work. Kimberly collapses and it is revealed she has an aneurysm and surgery will likely result in paralysis. Kimberly says she is done fighting and wants to go peacefully. Megan hires a full-time nurse for Kimberly but Michael believes Kimberly is faking it to get him back. He goes to the beach house and is shocked to see Kimberly barely hanging to life. He calls Marion and tells her to come to Los Angeles at once. Marion once again decides to take Kimberly back to Ohio. Michael says it is too dangerous to move her and accuses Marion of endangering Kimberly's life because she hates him. Marion admits she hates Michael because she feels Michael made Kimberly ill, but she intends to make Kimberly better. Kimberly has Michael and Megan over for a goodbye dinner but a fight between Marion and Michael prevents a goodbye. The next day, Marion is out and so Kimberly asks Megan to come pick her up so she can say goodbye to Michael. Kimberly says she has always loved Michael and needs to tell him so. However, Marion arrives and tells Megan off for moving Kimberly. Kimberly protests, insisting she must see Michael. However, she collapses and dies in her mother's arms. Megan informs Michael of Kimberly's death. Michael says he does not feel guilty and they must all go on with their lives. That night, he goes to the train station and finds Marion having Kimberly's coffin loaded onto the train. He tells her he cared very deeply for Kimberly and never meant to hurt her. She gives Michael a moment alone. The coffin is opened and Michael says goodbye, telling Kimberly he has always loved her and will never forget her. He kisses her. The train takes off and Michael breaks out in tears, the love of his life now gone forever. ==After Life== After Kimberly's death, Michael and Megan discover Kimberly left the beach house to them. Megan feels uncomfortable moving into the house Michael and Kimberly shared, but he convinces her to. Megan has a dream in which she sees Kimberly. Kimberly tells Megan she must be careful Michael does not let his ambition destroy her like it has all his other wives. She gives Megan advice on what would make Michael happy and then reveals there is a possibility she will be Megan's guardian angel. With that, Kimberly is never seen again. Several months after her death, Brett \\"Coop\\" Cooper visits Kimberly's grave, stating he will get revenge on Michael for what he did to Kimberly. Coop begins work at Wilshire. It is soon revealed years ago, while Kimberly was in a coma in Ohio and while Michael thought she was dead, Coop fell in love with Kimberly. When she awoke, the two formed a romance until Kimberly returned to Los Angeles to get revenge on Michael. Coop considers Kimberly the love of his life. Marion soon follows Coop to Los Angeles to help get revenge on Michael. Unaware of any of this at this stage, Michael finds Kimberly's lab-coat in place of his own, Kimberly's wedding dress arrives at his door, and he finds her storage room has been emptied with nothing but a photo of Michael and Kimberly, smashed on the ground. Michael then sees a woman's shadow at the beach house and she tries to shoot him. Michael is convinced Kimberly is still alive. Though Megan scoffs at this, Michael reminds Megan that Kimberly has done it before. It is soon revealed Marion is responsible for all this. Michael tells her he is sorry for all the harm he caused Kimberly but that he truly did love her. She goes back home to seek mental help. Months later, Coop still blames Michael for Kimberly's death and leaves Los Angeles. In the final episode of the series, in the final scene, Peter and Amanda discuss having children. Peter says they will have a Billy and an Alison, a Sydney, etc. Amanda says \\"Just promise me there will be no Kimberlys.\\" Peter promises. ==References== Category:Melrose Place (1992 TV series) characters Category:Fictional physicians Category:Fictional psychologists Category:Fictional attempted suicides Category:Television characters introduced in 1992 Category:Fictional characters from Cleveland Category:Fictional characters with multiple personalities Category:Fictional female doctors Category:American female characters in television ","title":"Kimberly Shaw"},{"id":"20514740","text":"is a former Japanese football player.

Baldwin Jr. (January 2, 1889 − January 27, 1977) was a prolific character actor whose career spanned five decades and 150 film and television roles, and numerous stage performances. Baldwin was born in Lima, Ohio from a theatrical family and served in the First World War. He was probably best known for playing the father of the handicapped sailor in The Best Years of Our Lives. He was the first actor to portray \\"Floyd the Barber\\" on The Andy Griffith Show. Prior to his first film roles in 1939, Baldwin had appeared in more than a dozen Broadway plays. He played Whit in the first Broadway production of Of Mice and Men, and also appeared in the original Grand Hotel in a small role, as well as serving as the production's stage manager. He originated the role of Bensinger, the prissy Chicago Tribune reporter, in the 1928 Broadway production of The Front Page. In the 1960s he had small acting roles in television shows such as Petticoat Junction and Green Acres. He continued to act in motion pictures, and one of his last roles was in Rosemary's Baby. Baldwin was known for playing solid middle class burghers, although sometimes he gave portrayals of eccentric characters. He played a customer seeking a prostitute in The Lost Weekend and the rebellious prison trusty Orvy in Cry of the City. Walter Baldwin was featured in a lot of John Deere Day Movies from 1949-59 where he played the farmer Tom Gordon. In this series of Deere Day movies over a decade he helped to introduce many new pieces of John Deere farm equipment year-by-year. In each yearly movie he would be shown in a Tom Gordon Family Film where he would be buying new John Deere farm equipment or a new green and yellow tractor. A picture of Walter Baldwin playing Tom Gordon can be found on page 108 of Bob Pripp's book John Deere Yesterday & Today Hal Erickson writes in Allmovie: \\"With a pinched Midwestern countenance that enabled him to portray taciturn farmers, obsequious grocery store clerks and the occasional sniveling coward, Baldwin was a familiar (if often unbilled) presence in Hollywood films for three decades.\\" ==Selected filmography== *Frontier Marshal (1939) -

It includes the Basque provinces of Álava, Biscay, and Gipuzkoa. The Basque Country or Basque Autonomous Community was granted the status of nationality within Spain, attributed by the Spanish Constitution of 1978. The autonomous community is based on the Statute of Autonomy of the Basque Country, a foundational legal document providing the framework for the development of the Basque people on Spanish soil. Navarre, which had narrowly rejected a joint statute of autonomy with Gipuzkoa, Álava and Biscay in 1932,Blinhorn, Martin The Basque Ulster': Navarre and the Basque Autonomy Question under the Spanish Second Republic The Historical Journal Vol. 17, No. 3 (Sep., 1974), pp. 595-613 was granted a separate statute in 1982. Currently there is no official capital in the autonomous community, but the city of Vitoria-Gasteiz, in the province of Álava, is the de facto capital as the location of the Basque Parliament, the headquarters of the Basque Government, and the residence of the President of the Basque Autonomous Community (the Palace of Ajuria Enea). The High Court of Justice of the Basque Country has its headquarters in the city of Bilbao. Whilst Vitoria-Gasteiz is the largest municipality in area, with 277 km2 (107 sq mi), Bilbao is the largest in population, with 353,187 people, located in the province of Biscay within a conurbation of 875,552 people. The term Basque Country may also refer to the larger cultural region (Basque: Euskal Herria), the home of the Basque people, which includes the autonomous community. ==Geography== The following provinces make up the autonomous community: * Álava (Basque Araba), capital Vitoria-Gasteiz * Biscay (Spanish Vizcaya, Basque Bizkaia), capital Bilbao-Bilbo * Gipuzkoa (Spanish Guipúzcoa), capital Donostia-San Sebastián ===Features=== Txindoki mountain from Lazkaomendi Basque coast near Mundaka Rioja vineyards near the Ebro The Basque Country borders Cantabria and the Burgos province to the west, the Bay of Biscay to the north, France (Nouvelle-Aquitaine) and Navarre to the east and La Rioja (the Ebro River) to the south. The territory has three distinct areas, which are defined by the two parallel ranges of the Basque Mountains. The main range of mountains forms the watershed between the Atlantic and Mediterranean basins. The highest point of the range is in the Aizkorri massif (1551 m). The three areas are: Atlantic Basin Formed by many valleys with short rivers that flow from the mountains to the Bay of Biscay, like the Nervión, Urola or Oria. The coast is rough, with high cliffs and small inlets. The main features of the coast are the Bilbao Abra Bay and the Estuary of Bilbao, the Urdaibai estuary and the Bidasoa-Txingudi Bay that forms the border with France. Middle section Between the two mountain ranges, the area is occupied mainly by a high plateau called Llanada Alavesa (the Álava Plains), where the capital Vitoria-Gasteiz is located. The rivers flow south from the mountains to the Ebro River. The main rivers are the Zadorra River and Bayas River. Ebro Valley From the southern mountains to the Ebro is the so- called Rioja Alavesa, which shares the Mediterranean characteristics of other Ebro Valley zones. Some of Spain's production of Rioja wine takes place here. ===Climate=== The Basque mountains form the watershed and also mark the distinct climatic areas of the Basque Country: The northern valleys, in Biscay and Gipuzkoa and also the valley of Ayala in Álava, are part of Green Spain, where the oceanic climate is predominant, with its wet weather all year round and moderate temperatures. Precipitation average is about 1200 mm. The middle section is influenced more by the continental climate, but with a varying degree of the northern oceanic climate. This gives warm, dry summers and cold, snowy winters. The Ebro valley has a pure continental climate: winters are cold and dry and summers very warm and dry, with precipitation peaking in spring and autumn. Due to the proximity to the ocean however, the Ebro part of the Basque Country is moderate compared to areas further inland. ==Demographics== Almost half of the 2,155,546 inhabitants of the Basque Autonomous Community live in Greater Bilbao, Bilbao's metropolitan area. Of the ten most populous cities, six form part of Bilbao's conurbation (Bilbao, Barakaldo, Getxo, Portugalete, Santurtzi and Basauri), which is also known as Greater Bilbao. With 28.2% of the Basque population born outside this region, immigration is crucial to Basque demographics. Over the 20th century most of this immigration came from other parts of Spain, typically from Galicia or Castile and León. Over recent years, sizeable numbers of this population have returned to their birthplaces and most immigration to the Basque country now comes from abroad, chiefly from South America. As of 2018, there were 151,519 foreigners in the Basque country, 7% of the population. {class=\\"infobox collapsible collapsed\\" +Foreign population by country of citizenship (2018) !

In 2012, the proportion of Basques that identify themselves as Roman Catholic was 58.6%,Interactivo: Creencias y prácticas religiosas en España while it is one of the most secularised communities of Spain: 24.6% were non- religious and 12.3% of Basques were atheist. ===Major cities=== # Bilbao-Bilbo (348,574) # Vitoria-Gasteiz (242,082) # San Sebastián-Donostia (186,409) # Barakaldo (100,502) # Getxo (83,000) # Irun (61,195) # Portugalete (47,756) # Santurtzi (46,978) # Basauri (42,971) # Errenteria (38,767) ===Languages=== Spanish and Basque are in the Glosas Emilianenses. The map shows the Kingdom of Pamplona between 1029 and 1035 Spanish and Basque are co-official in all territories of the autonomous community. The Basque-speaking areas in the modern-day autonomous community are set against the wider context of the Basque language, spoken to the east in Navarre and the French Basque Country. The whole Basque speaking territory has experienced both decline and expansion in its history. The Basque language experienced a gradual territorial contraction throughout the last nine centuries, and very severe deterioration of its sociolinguistic status for much of the 20th century due to heavy immigration from other parts of Spain, the virtual nonexistence of Basque language schooling, and national policies implemented by the different Spanish régimes (see Language policies of Francoist Spain). After the advent of the Statute of Autonomy of the Basque Country in 1982 following Franco's death, this reductive trend was gradually reversed thanks to the Basque language schools and the new education system. Basque has always had a strong presence in most of Gipuzkoa, central and eastern Biscay and the northern edge of Álava, while most Basque speakers in western Biscay and the rest of Álava are second-language speakers. The 2006 sociolinguistic surveyIV. Inkesta Soziolinguistikoa Gobierno Vasco, Servicio Central de Publicaciones del Gobierno Vasco 2008, of all Basque provinces showed that in 2006 of all people aged 16 and above in the Basque Autonomous Community, 30.1% were fluent Basque speakers, 18.3% passive speakers and 51.5% did not speak Basque. The percentage of Basque speakers was highest in Gipuzkoa (49.1% speakers) and lowest in Álava (14.2%). These results represent an increase on previous years (29.5% in 2001, 27.7% in 1996 and 24.1% in 1991). The highest percentage of speakers was now be found in the 16-24 age range (57.5%), while only 25.0% of those 65 and older reported speaking Basque. Ten years later, the sociolinguistic survey showed that in 2016 of all people aged 16 and above in the Basque Autonomous Community, 33.9% were fluent Basque speakers, 19.1% passive speakers and 47% did not speak Basque. The proportion of Basque speakers was again highest in Gipuzkoa (50.6%) and lowest in Álava (19.2%). ==History== :This section is about the history of the Autonomous Community since 1978. See also History of the Basque people Monument to the Battle of Vitoria, part of Spanish Independence War against the French rule. The forerunner of the Gernika Statute was the short-lived Statute of Autonomy for Álava, Gipuzkoa and Biscay, which came to be enforced in October 1936 just in Biscay, with the Spanish Civil War already raging, and which was automatically abolished when the Spanish Nationalist troops occupied the territory. Before the Spanish Constitution of 1978 and its system of autonomous communities, these three provinces were known in Spanish as the Provincias Vascongadas since 1833. The political structure of the new autonomous community is defined in the Gernika Statute, which was approved by a majority in a referendum held on 25 October 1979. Nowadays it is one of the most decentralised regions in the world; in this regard it has been described as having \\"more autonomy than just about any other in Europe\\" by The Economist. Castile and later the Spanish Navy. As regards the bounds to the Spanish Constitution, Basque nationalists cite the fact that in the 1978 Spanish Constitution referendum, which was passed with a majority of votes and a poor turnout in this area, the Basque Country had the highest abstention (the Basque Nationalist Party had endorsed abstention on the grounds that the Constitution was being forced upon them without any Basque input). To this, the \\"NO\\" vote in this referendum was also higher in the Basque Country than in the rest of the state. All in all, many Basques believe that they are not bound to a constitution that they never endorsed. The Statute of Autonomy of the Basque Country is an organic law but powers have been devolved gradually during decades according to re- negotiations between the Spanish and the consecutive Basque regional governments to reach an effective implementation, while the transfer of many powers are still due and has always been a matter of heated political discussion. Basque nationalists often put down this limitation in the devolution of powers to concessions made to appease the military involved in the 23-F coup d'état attempt (1981). In 2003, the governing Basque Nationalist Party (PNV) proposed to alter this statute through the Ibarretxe Plan. The Ibarretxe bill was approved by absolute majority in the Basque Parliament after much discussion, as it was subject to lengthy legal objections--on the grounds that it contradicts the Spanish Constitution--that were ultimately overcome. Despite its mandate of the majority of the autonomous Parliament, the main two parties in Spain (PSOE, PP) imposed a blockade on a discussion of the Plan in the Spanish Parliament (Madrid Cortes Generales), resulting in its rejection for debate by a large majority of that Parliament in January 2005. Since the first autonomic cabinet, the Basque Nationalist Party has held office in the Basque Autonomous Community except for a 2009-2012 term, led by Patxi López (PSE-PSOE). The current Basque prime minister is Iñigo Urkullu, also a member of the Basque Nationalist Party. Despite ETA's ceasefire in 2011, this autonomous community shows the highest rate of police per 100 inhabitants in Western Europe by 2018. As agreed with the Spanish premier Zapatero in 2004, Urkullu intends to increase the figure of ertzainas, while the Spanish PP's Ministry of Interior rejects a pullback of Spanish police bodies, as demanded by the large majority of the political forces in the autonomous parliament, even pointing to an increase of the Guardia Civil in the future. ==PoliticsGovernmental institutions=== Basque parliament building in Vitoria-Gasteiz The current laws configure the autonomous community as a federation of its present-day three constituent provinces. These western Basque districts kept governing themselves by their own laws and institutions even after the Castilian invasion in 1199-1200. The new king upheld their institutional system issued from the consuetudinary law prevalent in Basque and Pyrenean territories. This limited self-government, similar to the one for Navarre, was partially suppressed in 1839 and totally in 1876 in exchange for an agreement on tax-collection and a number of administrative prerogatives. These in turn were suspended by Franco for Gipuzkoa and Biscay, but restored by the Spanish Constitution of 1978. The post-Franco Spanish Constitution of 1978 acknowledges historical rights and attempts a compromise in the old conflict between centralism and the different national identities (Basque, Catalan, and Galician). A negotiation between UCD's Suárez in office and PNV led to the establishment of the Basque statute, with its first article stating that the Basque people (Euskal Herria) takes on an institutional personality in the form of the Basque Autonomous Community; the 2nd article goes on to establish that it may be constituted by Álava, Biscay, Gipuzkoa, as well as Navarre . Provincial councils provided with actual relevant attributions (taxation, etc.) were restored to these provinces (called therefore diputación foral), but Navarre detached from the Basque political process. A specific approach to the national realities in Spain was eventually diffused by a legal provision allowing for the establishment of autonomous administrations and parliaments to any region in Spain (e.g. Castile and León, Catalonia, the Valencian Community, etc.), while the Basques, Catalans, and Galicians were acknowledged historic specificity. Ajuria Enea Palace, official residence of the Lehendakari in Vitoria-Gasteiz The provinces in the Basque Country still perform tax collection in their respective territories, but with limited margin in decision making under the Spanish and European governments. Under this intricate system, the Diputaciones Forales (Basque: Foru Aldundiak) administer most of each of the provinces but are coordinated by the autonomous Basque Government (Spanish Gobierno Vasco, Basque: Eusko Jaurlaritza). The autonomous community has its own police force (the Ertzaintza), controls Education and Health Systems, and has a Basque radio/TV station. These and only some of the powers acknowledge in the Gernika Statute have since 1980 been transferred to the Autonomous Community by the Cortes Generales under the Gernika Statute. The seats of the Basque Parliament and Government are in Vitoria-Gasteiz, so this is the capital city de facto, but the Basque Autonomous Community has no capital de iure. Oak of Gernika, symbol of the Basque institutions. The Parliament is composed of 25 representatives from each of the three provinces. The Basque Parliament elects the Lehendakari (President of the Autonomous Community of the Basque Country) who forms a government following regular parliamentary procedures. Until 2020, except for the 2009-2012 period, all Lehendakaris (even those in 1937 and during the exile) have been members of the Basque Nationalist Party (Euzko Alderdi Jeltzalea) (moderate and Christian-Democrat) since 1978. Despite their continued leadership role, they have not always enjoyed majorities for their party and have needed to form coalitions with either Spain wide parties or left-leaning Basque nationalist parties, often governing in a difficult minority position. Since 1982 until the late 1990s, Basque nationalists ideologically closer to ETA refused to turn out in the Basque parliament, a significant wedge of the parliament. Currently, the Basque Government is headed by Iñigo Urkullu (PNV). thumbSummary from 2020 Basque Parliament election results ===Present-day political dynamics=== ETA's permanent ceasefire (2010-2011) opened the possibility of new governmental alliances and has enabled EH Bildu's electoral success and rise to governmental institutions (Gipuzkoa, and capital city Donostia, 2011-2015). In the 2012 Basque parliamentary election, the PNV obtained a plurality of the votes, followed by the left-wing nationalist coalition EH Bildu (Eusko Alkartasuna, Sortu, Alternatiba). In 2016 the Basque regional election was held on 25 September to elect the 11th Parliament of the Basque Autonomous Community, which left a hung parliament, with the combination of Basque nationalist parties (PNV and EH Bildu) representing the largest wedge in the parliament of the Basque Autonomous Community, the main Spanish parties PP and PSOE's branches occupying a 24% of the seats, and Podemos - Ahal Dugu accounting for 11 seats (14,66% of the total). However, the leading party PNV renewed its traditional alliance with the PSE to form government. During the 2017 Catalan referendum crisis, the parliament showed its sympathy and support to the Catalan independence referendum and lashed out at the Spanish government's stance on the issue, denouncing any measures it may take against the vote or 'democracy' altogether. Besides supporting the vote, Basques of this community showed a preference for further self-government (43,5%), with independence and present- day status quo ranking as second and third options (22,6% and 18,9%). In 2016, the parliament of the autonomous community passed a Police Abuses Act spanning the period between 1978 and 1999; it was shortly after challenged by the public prosecutor and appealed also by virtually all police and Civil Guard unions. Incoming Spanish premier Pedro Sanchez agreed to lift the public prosecutor's block on the law in exchange for altering its content. Right-wing parties in Spain, Vox, PP, and Ciudadanos, sent one MP out of 18 to the Spanish Congress from this autonomous community in the 2019 November general election in contrast with their rise and important presence in the overall Spanish results. ===Territorial issues=== The statute, insofar as it is addressed and provides an administrative framework for the Basque people, provides the mechanisms for neighbouring Navarre to join the three western provinces if it wishes to do so, since at least part of it is ethnically Basque. The Basque Government used the \\"Laurak Bat\\", which included the arms of Navarre, as its symbol for many years. The Navarrese Government protested, and tribunals ruled in their favour. The Basque Government replaced it with an empty red field. Navarre is one of the historical Basque territories and even claimed by the Basque nationalists as the core of the Basque nation. There are also two enclaves surrounded by Basque territory—Treviño (Basque: Trebiñu) and Valle de Villaverde (Basque: Villaverde-Turtzioz)—which belong to the fellow neighbouring communities of Castile and León and Cantabria respectively, for which a legal connection to the Basque Country has become an on-off matter of political discussion. ==Economy== Iberdrola Tower in Bilbao. The Basque Autonomous Community ranks first in Spain in terms of per capita income, with a nominal gross domestic product (GDP) per capita (adjusted to purchasing power parity, PPP) being 22% higher than that of the European Union and 30% higher than Spain's average in 2016, and at €34,400 in 2015. In 2019, the community showed a surplus in public deficit, a 0.3% of the GDP. Industrial activities were traditionally centred on steel and shipbuilding, mainly due to the rich iron ore resources found during the 19th century around Bilbao. The Estuary of Bilbao was the centre of Euskadi's industrial revolution during the 19th and the first half of the 20th century. These activities decayed during the economic crisis of the 1970s and 1980s, giving ground for the development of the services sector and new technologies. Edinburgh tram car assembled in CAF Beasain (Gipuzkoa) Today, the strongest industrial sectors of the Basque Country's economy are machine tool, present in the valleys of Biscay and Gipuzkoa; aeronautics in Vitoria-Gasteiz; and energy, in Bilbao. The main companies in the Basque Country are: BBVA bank, Iberdrola energy company (both of them have their headquarters in Bilbao), Mondragón Cooperative Corporation --MCC, the largest cooperative in the world--Gamesa wind turbine producer and CAF rolling stock producer. MCC's business leadership in the Basque Country hangs in the balance after Fagor, its flagship cooperative of household appliances and goods manufacturing, declared bankruptcy in 2014. Eight out of ten Spanish municipalities with the lowest unemployment rates were found across this autonomous community in 2015, highlighting such towns as Arrasate, Portugalete and Barakaldo with a strong manufacturing industrial make-up. The Basque Autonomous Community ranked above other communities in Spain in terms of resilience in the face of the economic crisis, going on to become a beacon and a subject of study in Europe. The Basque Autonomous Community ranks first in Spain in terms of per capita income, with a nominal gross domestic product (GDP) per capita (adjusted to purchasing power parity, PPP) being 22% higher than that of the European Union and 30% higher than Spain's average in 2016, and at €34,400 in 2015. In 2019, the community showed a surplus in public deficit, a 0.3% of the GDP. In 2013 the Basque Country outperformed Spain in several parameters, but economic overall figures were highly variable. Spanish figures are subject to conspicuous seasonal fluctuation, relying on its tourist and services sectors, while Basque performance is rather based on mid- and long-term results, according with its more industrial focus. In the last quarter of 2017, unemployment in this autonomous community rose to 11.1% (8.43% in Gipuzkoa), second lowest in Spain after Navarre, at a percentage slightly higher than the EU average (10.8%), but still ahead of the Spanish overall unemployment rate of around 16.55%, the second highest in the EU. {  !Year !2006 !2007 !2008 !2009 !2010 !2011 !2012 !2013 !2014 !2015 !2016 !2017 - unemployment rate (in %) 7.2% 6.2% 6.6% 11.3% 10.7% 12.4% 15.6% 16.6% 16.3% 14.8% 12.6% 11.3% } Arteche In regards to GDP performance, 2017 was a remarkably positive year for the Basque Autonomous Community. It underwent an increase in GDP of 3.0%, close to the Spanish increase, 3.1%. In the last term of 2013, the public debt of the Basque Autonomous Community stood at 13.00% of its GDP, totalling 3,753 € per capita, as compared to Spain's overall 93.90%, totalling 20,383 € per capita. The Basque Government's high-ranking officials, as well as Basque-based party leaders and personalities, have protested and voiced their concern over the detrimental effects of austerity measures passed by the Spanish Government as of 2011, overruling Basque taxation powers, may be having on industry and trade, especially export. Basque officials have strongly advocated for participation, along with Navarre, in the Ecofin, with a full membership, in order to defend Basque interests in line with Basque reality and fiscal status, and not as a Spanish subsidiary. ===Transport=== AP-8 in Eibar The strategic geographical location of the Basque Country as a link between the northwest and centre of Spain and the rest of Europe makes this territory heavily transited. Road The main backbones of road transport are the AP-8 motorway which links Bilbao, San Sebastián and the French border and the A-1 motorway which links San Sebastián and Vitoria- Gasteiz with central Spain. Other important routes include the AP-68 motorway which links Bilbao with the Mediterranean. Rail Eusko Trenbide Sarea (Basque Railway Network) is the Basque Government-owned company that maintains and creates the railway infrastructure in the autonomous region. EuskoTren (Basque Train) is the Basque Government-owned narrow gauge rail company that operates commuter services in Bilbao and San Sebastián, intercity Bilbao-San Sebastián service, and EuskoTran tram services in Bilbao and Vitoria-Gasteiz. Metro Bilbao operates two metro lines that serve the Greater Bilbao area while EuskoTren operates a third which opened in 2017. EuskoTren operates a metro service in the San Sebastián area, known as Metro Donostialdea. The Spanish government owns two main RENFE broad gauge lines that link Vitoria-Gasteiz with San Sebastián and Bilbao with central Spain. It also operates Cercanías commuter lines in both Bilbao and San Sebastián. The Basque Y The FEVE narrow gauge rail company operates a commuter line between Bilbao and Balmaseda and links Bilbao with the rest of northern Spain. A new high-speed network (called Basque Y) currently under construction will link the three capitals in 'Y' formation. Because of the rough geography of the territory, most of the network will run through tunnels, with a total estimated cost of up to €10 billion. The estimated ecological impact of the project has encouraged the formation of a group campaigning against it called AHTrik Ez Elkarlana. The group uses social disobedience to oppose the project and promotes referendums against it in the towns it most affects. In spite of the vocal opposition to the project by this and other community groups (as well as EH Bildu), work continues, not without uncertainty. In early 2015, an estimate suggested that the average Basque intercity fare would rise to a non-competitive 25 €, while the Spanish central government's funding has been subject to continuous delays, spurring the irritation of the Basque government in Vitoria-Gasteiz. Airports Bilbao Airport The three capitals have airports: *Bilbao Airport (BIO) International *Vitoria Airport (VIT) *San Sebastián Airport (EAS) Of the three, the most important hub and entry point to the Basque Country is Bilbao Airport, offering many international connections. Nearly 4,600,000 passengers passed through it in 2016. Seaports The two most important ports are the Port of Bilbao and the Port of Pasaia. There are also minor fishing ports, such as Bermeo and Ondarroa. The Port of Bilbao is by far the most important in the Basque Country and the north of Spain, being the fourth most important in Spain with over 38 million tons of traffic. All cruising routes arrive in Bilbao and there is a ferry service linking Bilbao with Portsmouth (United Kingdom). ==Cuisine== Two sample pintxos Basque cuisine is an important part of Basque culture. According to the chef Ferran Adrià, San Sebastián \\"in terms of the average quality of the food, in terms of what you can get at any place you happen to walk into, maybe it is—probably it is, yes—the best in the world.\\" The most popular dishes are seafood, fish (for example Marmitako) and \\"Pintxos\\", bar finger food. During the 1970s, several chefs from the Basque Country, particularly Juan Mari Arzak and Pedro Subijana, led a gastronomic revolution, translating to Spain the principles of French nouvelle cuisine. The first Spanish restaurant to be awarded 3 stars in the Michelin Guide was, in fact, Zalacaín, a Basque restaurant, although located in Madrid. Today, the Basque Country, alongside Catalonia, is the Spanish region with a higher density of stars in the Michelin Guide, and it has become a preferred destination of many gastronomic tourists, both domestic and international. Four restaurants boast 3 stars, the highest possible award: Juan María Arzak (Arzak restaurant), Martín Berasategui (Berasategui restaurant), Pedro Subijana (chef of Akelarre) and Eneko Atxa (Azurmendi restaurant). In the new generation of chefs, Andoni Luis Aduriz, Mugaritz restaurant, is outstanding. The coastal city of San Sebastián is home to the Basque Culinary Center, an academic research institution focused on higher education and research in the areas of gastronomy and nutrition. Basque food is one of the reasons for tourism to the Basque Country, especially the pintxos. A popular way to socialise is \\"ir de pintxos\\" or txikiteo, a Basque version of a pub crawl, albeit generally more civilised. ==Sports== Pelota (jai alai) court in Sara, Lapurdi Basque rural sports, known as Herri Kirolak in Basque, are a number of sports competitions rooted in the traditional lifestyles of the Basque people, for example Basque pelota, the Basque version of the European game family that includes real tennis and squash. Basque players, playing for either the Spanish or the French teams, dominate international competitions. The Basque country is also home to former national football champions Athletic Club from Bilbao. It has a strict Cantera policy of employing only players born or trained in the Basque Country (greater region). Athletic's policy does not apply to head coaches, with famous names as Howard Kendall and Jupp Heynckes coaching the team at various points. In spite of this, the club shares with worldwide heavyweights Real Madrid and FC Barcelona the distinction of never being relegated from the top flight. Another major Basque Country club is Real Sociedad from San Sebastián, who contest the Basque derby with Athletic. Real Sociedad used to practise the same policy, until they signed Irish striker John Aldridge in the late 1980s. Since then, Real Sociedad have had many foreign players. Xabi Alonso became the only Basque player to win both the World Cup and the club European Cup and he played in the Real Sociedad. The region is also home to other La Liga clubs SD Eibar and Deportivo Alavés. The most renowned Basque footballer of all time is possibly Andoni Zubizarreta who holds the record for appearances in La Liga with 622 games and has won six league titles and the European Cup. Nowadays, the best known Basque football player is Xabi Alonso, winner of two UEFA European Championships and one World Cup, who played for Real Sociedad, Liverpool, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich, but retired in 2017. Other notable Basque players include Mikel Arteta, Asier Illarramendi, Andoni Iraola, Aritz Aduriz, Xabi Prieto and Ander Herrera. Both Athletic and Real Sociedad have won the Spanish league, including dominating the competition in the early 1980s, with the last title won by a Basque club being Athletic's 1984 title. At international level, Basque players were especially prominent in Spanish selections prior to the Civil War, with all of those at the 1928 Olympics, and the majority of the 1920 Olympics and 1934 World Cup squads, born in the region. There is an unofficial 'national' team which plays occasional friendlies, however its squads pick players from the wider territory including Navarre and the French Basque Country. Cycling as a sport is popular in the Basque Country. Abraham Olano has won the Vuelta a España and the World Championship. The UCI World Tour hails from the Basque Country. Also previously known as Caisse d'Épargne, the Movistar team traces its history back to the Banesto team that included Miguel Induráin. The region is home to the Tour of the Basque Country stage race and the Clasica de San Sebastian one day race. The team was also part of the World Tour until its disbandment in 2014. It was an unofficial Basque national team and was partly funded by the Basque Government. Its riders were either Basque, or at least grown up in the Basque cycling culture, and former members of the team have been strong contenders in the Tour de France held annually in July and Vuelta a España held in September. Team leaders have included riders such as Iban Mayo, Haimar Zubeldia, Samuel Sánchez, David Etxebarria, Igor Antón, Mikel Landa and Mikel Nieve. The team was revived in 2020 at UCI ProTeam level when Euskaltel reinstated its sponsorship. ==Notable people== Some notable Basque people from this administrative jurisdiction include Francisco de Vitoria, philosopher who set the theories of just war, international law and freedom of commerce; Juan Sebastián Elcano, completed first circumnavigation of the Earth; Ignatius of Loyola, founder of the Jesuits; Don Juan de Oñate, explorer of the great plains and Colorado river; Blas de Lezo, naval strategist, best remembered for his defensive tactics at the Battle of Cartagena de Indias; Jorge Oteiza sculptor; Paco Rabanne, fashion designer; Cristóbal Balenciaga, fashion designer; Xabi Alonso and Mikel Arteta, footballers; Edurne Pasaban, first woman to climb all of the fourteen eight-thousander peaks in the World; Elena Arzak, best female chef in the world (2012); Jon Kortajarena male model; Jose- Maria Cundin, artist; Fernando Savater philosopher; Miguel de Unamuno, essayist, novelist, poet, playwright, philosopher. ==See also== * Basque Country (greater region) * Basque mythology * Basque breeds and cultivars * Livestock in the Basque Country ==References== * Pierson, Peter (1999).

It ran through the county of Amberg-Sulzbach from Amberg along the river Vils as far as Schmidmühlen. Although as early as 1904 the legal basis had been established for this Lokalbahn route that was to link Amberg along the Vils valley with Schmidmühlen, there were considerable delays due to numerous arguments over questions of detail as well as over an extension of the line to Hohenburg in the Lauterach valley. The first section to Ensdorf, which branched off the line to Lauterhofen at Drahthammer station, was not opened until 1 May 1910. The second section followed on 18 December 1910, bringing the total length of the line to 21 kilometres. Passenger trains, however, started from Amberg, so that the journey was about 2 kilometres longer. As a result of the increased use of railway buses in the 1950s and 1960s, passenger services on the rails were withdrawn on 1 July 1966. Goods traffic continued for considerably longer, albeit only for one customer: the limekiln belonging to the Maxhütte factory at Vilshofen. From time to time heavy goods trains, which needed three DB Class 211 diesel locomotives, ran to the kiln. But on 28 May 1988 that came to an end; the section south of Vilshofen had already closed on 31 May 1985. In 1990 the route was purchased by the county (Landkreis) and converted to a cycle path between 1991 and 1992. == Sources == * Gerald Hoch, Andreas Kuhfahl: Nebenbahnen in der Oberpfalz. 1.

The ultimate causes and mechanisms of sexual orientation development in humans remain unclear and many theories are speculative and controversial. However, advances in neuroscience explain and illustrate characteristics linked to sexual orientation. Studies have explored structural neural-correlates, functional and/or cognitive relationships, and developmental theories relating to sexual orientation in humans. == Developmental neurobiology == Many theories concerning the development of sexual orientation involve fetal neural development, with proposed models illustrating prenatal hormone exposure, maternal immunity, and developmental instability. Other proposed factors include genetic control of sexual orientation. No conclusive evidence has been shown that environmental or learned effects are responsible for the development of non-heterosexual orientation. As of 2005, sexual dimorphisms in the brain and behavior among vertebrates were accounted for by the influence of gonadal steroidal androgens as demonstrated in animal models over the prior few decades. The prenatal androgen model of homosexuality describes the neuro-developmental effects of fetal exposure to these hormones. In 1985, Geschwind and Galaburda proposed that homosexual men are exposed to high androgen levels early in development and proposed that temporal and local variations in androgen exposure to a fetus's developing brain is a factor in the pathways determining homosexuality. This led scientists to look for somatic markers for prenatal hormonal exposure that could be easily, and non-invasively, explored in otherwise endocrinologically normal populations. Various somatic markers (including 2D:4D finger ratios, auditory evoked potentials, fingerprint patterns and eye-blink patterns) have since been found to show variation based on sexual orientation in healthy adult individuals. Other evidence supporting the role of testosterone and prenatal hormones in sexual orientation development include observations of male subjects with cloacal exstrophy who were sex-assigned as female during birth only later to declare themselves male. This supports the theory that the prenatal testosterone surge is crucial for gender identity development. Additionally, females whose mothers were exposed to diethylstilbestrol (DES) during pregnancy show higher rates of bi- and homosexuality. Variations in the hypothalamus may have some influence on sexual orientation. Studies show that factors such as cell number and size of various nuclei in the hypothalamus may impact ones sexual orientation. Swaab, DF, Gooren LJ, Hofman, MA (October 2010). \\"Brain research, gender and sexual orientation,Pub Med. == Brain research == The sexually dimorphic nucleus of the preoptic area (SDN-POA) of the anterior hypothalamus shows sex-differences (between males and females) in structure in a number of mammals (e.g., sheep/rams, mice, rats). There is also evidence that the SDN-POA, or nearby regions, help mediate sex-dimorphic mating behavior, including in sheep/rams—an imperfect but reasonable animal model for human sexual orientation. A potentially homologous site in humans—the third interstitial nucleus of the anterior hypothalamus (INAH-3)—also shows sex differences, and differs in size and cell number between heterosexual and homosexual men, a finding that has been replicated in subsequent research. There is also evidence that regions of the anterior hypothalamus in humans can be activated by smelling hormone-like steroids (i.e., pheromones), and such activation varies by sex and sexual orientation in men and women. Thus, POA-like brain regions may be partially processing sex stimuli associated with basic attractions to others. There are other brain sites beyond the POA that have been linked to sexual orientation in humans (e.g. suprachiasmatic nucleus), but these brain regions are unlikely to mediate directly basic sexual attractions to men or women, as these sites have not been linked to sexual behavior, but they do indicate there are other regions which are also \\"sex inverted\\" in homosexuals compared to heterosexuals. == Fraternal birth order effect == Neuroscience has been implicated in the study of birth order and male sexual orientation. A significant volume of research has found that the more older brothers a man has from the same mother, the greater the probability he will have a homosexual orientation. Estimates indicate that there is a 33%–48% increase in chances of homosexuality in a male child with each older brother, and the effect is not observed in those with older adoptive or step-brothers, indicative of a prenatal biological mechanism. Ray Blanchard and Anthony Bogaert discovered the association in the 1990s, and named it the fraternal birth order (FBO) effect. The mechanism by which the effect is believed to operate states that a mother develops an immune response against a substance important in male fetal development during pregnancy, and that this immune effect becomes increasingly likely with each male fetus gestated by the mother. This immune effect is thought to cause an alteration in (some) later born males' prenatal brain development. The target of the immune response are molecules (specifically Y-linked proteins, which are thought to play a role in fetal brain sex-differentiation) on the surface of male fetal brain cells, including in sites of the anterior hypothalamus (which has been linked to sexual orientation in other research). Antibodies produced during the immune response are thought to cross the placental barrier and enter the fetal compartment where they bind to the Y-linked molecules and thus alter their role in sexual differentiation, leading some males to be attracted to men as opposed to women. Biochemical evidence to support this hypothesis was identified in 2017, finding mothers of gay sons, particularly those with older brothers, had significantly higher anti-NLGN4Y levels than other samples of women, including mothers of heterosexual sons. The effect does not mean that all or most sons will be gay after several male pregnancies, but rather, the odds of having a gay son increase from approximately 2% for the first born son, to 4% for the second, 6% for the third and so on. Scientists have estimated between 15% and 29% of gay men owe their sexual orientation to this effect, but the number may be higher, as prior miscarriages and terminations of male pregnancies may have exposed their mothers to Y-linked antigens. In addition, the effect is nullified in left handed men. As it is contingent on handedness and handedness is a prenatally determined trait, it further attributes the effect to be biological, rather than psychosocial. The fraternal birth order effect does not apply to the development of female homosexuality. Blanchard does not believe the same antibody response would cause homosexuality in first born gay sons – instead, they may owe their orientation to genes, prenatal hormones and other maternal immune responses which also influence fetal brain development. The few studies which have not observed a correlation between gay men and birth order have generally been criticized for methodological errors and sampling methods. Ray Blanchard considers the effect to be \\"one of the most reliable epidemiological variables ever identified in the study of sexual orientation\\", and J. Michael Bailey has said that no plausible hypothesis other than a maternal immune response has been identified. == Research directions == As of 2005, research directions included: * finding markers for sex steroid levels in the brains of fetuses that highlight features of early neuro-development leading to certain sexual orientations * determine the precise neural circuitry underlying direction of sexual preference * use animal models to explore genetic and developmental factors that influence sexual orientation * further population studies, genetic studies, and serological markers to clarify and definitively determine the effect of maternal immunity * neuroimaging studies to quantify sexual- orientation-related differences in structure and function in vivo * neurochemical studies to investigate the roles of sex steroids upon neural circuitry involved in sexual attraction ==See also== * Neuroscience of sex differences == References == Category:Behavioral neuroscience Category:Sexual orientation and science Category:Sexual orientation and medicine ","title":"Neuroscience and sexual orientation"},{"id":"20515075","text":"Steven Jacobs (born 6 June 1987) is a Belgian footballer who played for clubs including FCV Dender EH. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:1987 births Category:Living people Category:Belgian footballers Category:F.C.V.

It is possible that the city was named for Pharaoh Amenhotep IV also known by the name Akhenaten, the founder of a brief period of monotheism (Atenism) from the 18th dynasty of rulers of Egypt during 1352-1334 BC. The name Hanaton (pronounced Khanaton) and the name Akhenaten have identical consonants, which in the Semitic languages of the period are more significant than vowels, which may vary. ==HistoryBiblical period=== Tel Hanaton is associated with the biblical Hanaton, mentioned in The Book of Joshua in the lands apportioned to the Tribe of Zevulun: \\"Then the border went around it on the north side of Hannathon, and it ended in the Valley of Jiphthah El.\\" (Joshua 19:14) The tel rises to 75m above the surrounding valley, part of which represents the stratification layers on which the Bronze Age and later settlements were built on a natural outcrop of rock. Archaeologists believe the settlement dates to the Middle Bronze Age. The site has easy access to water sources; nearby forested areas for wood; limestone hills to quarry for building materials and tools; fertile surrounding arable land for crops and livestock; the presence of clay for pottery in the muddy earth surrounding the tel caused by seasonal flooding; the natural rock outcrop raised above its surroundings for easy fortification. It was also located on the international trade route of the period - a branch of the Via Maris. ===Middle Bronze Age (Canaanite Period)=== Tiglath-Pileser III—stela from the walls of his palace (British Museum, London) The Tel is mentioned as 'Hinnatuna' in the 14th Century BC Amarna Letters of Ancient Egypt, showing the city's importance on a major trade route. Hinnatuna is referenced in 2 Amarna letters, EA 8, and EA 245 ('EA' stands for 'El Amarna'). In Amarna letter EA 8, king Burna-Buriash of Babylon complains to the Pharaoh about some Babylonian merchants being killed somewhere near the city of 'Hinnatuna of Canaan', and asks him to take measures.Graciela Singer (2014), Fortunes and Misfortunes of Messengers and Merchants in the Amarna Letters. Amarna letter EA 245 is a letter to Pharaoh from Biridiya, a local ruler.Amarna Tablet 244: Letter from Biridiya of Megiddo to Pharaoh. kchanson.com It concerns a certain Labayu, who was probably the mayor of Shechem (Šakmu). This Labayu was then in trouble with the Pharaoh, but somehow escaped punishment after being held for a while in Hinnatuna. Hanaton is mentioned some 700 years later in records at Niniveh, the capital of Ancient Assyria as one of the 5 [Israelite] cities totally destroyed by Tiglath-pileser III, King of Assyria, in the campaign of conquest of the (Northern) Biblical Kingdom of Israel between 724-722 BC. The area of the Bronze Age city reached 100 dunams (approx. 25 acres) which attests to the power and wealth of the settlement, most likely achieved due to the large tracts of highly fertile arable land surrounding the tel in the Beit Netofa Valley, together with its position astride a major 'Egypt to Mesopotamia' international trade route for the period. ===Iron Age (Israelite period)=== Crusader arch at Tel Hanaton Crusader stairs at Tel Hanaton Most Bronze Age tels were forced by increasing populations to expand beyond their hilltops during the Iron (Israelite) age, protected by retaining walls built further out encompassing a greater area. In these cases the former Tel forms the acropolis of the expanded city. Hanaton could not expand in this manner as its immediately surrounding land was subject to months-long flooding following winter rains and drainage technology of the period did not allow for drying up such land. Restricted in this manner from expansion, the city, whilst never abandoned through to the Roman Period, and unable to expand to the size of Hellenistic period cities, continually declined and was replaced as a major trading and urban centre by nearby Sepphoris which was established on the ridge a few kilometres to the south east. ===Early Arab and Crusader periods=== During the Early Arab Period, the site became a small agricultural village named Hotsfit, a name which survived into the Crusader Period. The site shows physical evidence of typical Frankish construction with stone stairwells, large halls and arched ceilings, which may have been part of an 11th-century fortified agricultural settlement together with nearby Sepphoris (also known as Dioceserea). The architecture, whilst having much in common with concurrent strongholds of the Ayyubid period, has distinct Crusader features, such as the arch-free flat-roofed stairwells. ===Mamluk period=== In the 1330s the region was conquered by the Mamelukes of Egypt, who used the Crusader fort to house their garrison. ===Ottoman era=== The Arabic name for the tel, Tal Badawiye relates to the Ottoman Period when a Caravanserai named Khan El Badawiye was established atop the tel. Historical geographer, Victor Guérin, thought that the tel may have been the village Garis mentioned by Josephus in The Jewish War, because of its proximity to Sepphoris., p. 494, who wrote: \\"...Il ne nous reste donc plus maintenant pour y placer Garis ou Garsis que la colline où sont éparses les ruines de Bir el-Bedaouïeh\\" (Translation: \\"...We now have nothing left to place Garis or Garsis here except the hill where the ruins of Bir el-Bedouieh are scattered\\"). ==See also== * Hannathon *Archaeology of Israel ==ReferencesFurther reading== *Hanaton: Interim Report on a Chalcolithic Settlement in the Lower Galilee Category:Archaeological sites in Israel Category:Hebrew Bible mountains Category:Ancient sites in Israel Category:Amarna letters locations Category:Former populated places in Southwest Asia ","title":"Tel Hanaton"},{"id":"20515118","text":"Sewu () is an eighth century Mahayana Buddhist temple located 800 metres north of Prambanan in Central Java, Indonesia. The word for a Hindu or Buddhist temple in Indonesian is \\"candi,\\" hence the common name is \\"Candi Sewu.\\" Candi Sewu is the second largest Buddhist temple complex in Indonesia; Borobudur is the largest. Sewu predates nearby \\"Loro Jonggrang\\" temple at Prambanan. Although the complex consists of 249 temples, this Javanese name translates to 'a thousand temples,' which originated from popular local folklore (The Legend of Loro Jonggrang). Archaeologists believe the original name for the temple compound to be Manjusrigrha. ==HistoryConstruction=== Manjusrigrha inscription (792 CE), discovered in 1960 at the outer west perwara temple no. 202 (row 4 no. 37) of Sewu Buddhist temple. According to the Kelurak inscription (dated from 782 CE) and the Manjusrigrha inscription (dated from 792 CE), which were discovered in 1960, the original name of the temple complex was probably \\"Manjusri grha\\" (The House of Manjusri). Manjusri is a Bodhisattva from Mahayana Buddhist teachings that symbolizes the \\"gentle glory\\" of transcendent wisdom (Sanskrit: prajñā). Sewu Temple was built by the end of eighth century at the end of Rakai Panangkaran's reign and was completed during the reign of his successor, King Indra. Rakai Panangkaran (746–780 CE) was well known as a devoted Mahayana Buddhist king who ruled the Medang Mataram Kingdom. The Manjusrigrha temple was the largest Buddhist temple in the Prambanan Plain region, predating the nearby Prambanan Shivaist temple by over 70 years and the Borobudur by about 37 years. Located in the heart of Mataram, the temple served as the royal Buddhist temple of the kingdom. Stately religious ceremonies were held here regularly. The Manjusrigrha inscription (792) praises the perfect beauty of the prasada (tower) of this temple compound. The Bubrah temple, located several hundred meters south, and the Gana temple, located east of the Sewu temple, probably served as guardian temples for the Manjusrigrha complex, guarding the four cardinal directions around the Sewu temple. The ruins of the Lor temple to the north of Sewu and the Kulon temple on the western side are both in poor condition; only a few stones remain on those sites. Prior to the construction of Borobudur and Prambanan, Sewu likely served as the kingdom's main temple. The temples are arranged in the mandala layout, which symbolizes the universe in Buddhist cosmology. Sewu temple was probably expanded and completed during the rule of Rakai Pikatan, a prince who married a Buddhist princess from the Sailendra dynasty, Pramodhawardhani. Most of his subjects retained their old religions after the court returned to favour Hinduism. The proximity of the Sewu temple to Prambanan, a Hindu Temple, suggests that the Hindu and Buddhist communities lived in harmony during the era in which the temples were built. And the scale of the temple complex suggests that Candi Sewu was a royal Buddhist temple that served as an important religious site. The temple is located on the Prambanan Plain, between the southeastern slopes of the Merapi volcano and the Sewu mountain range in the south, near the present border of Yogyakarta province and Klaten Regency in central Java. The plain has many archaeological sites scattered only a few miles apart, which suggests that this area served as an important religious, political, and urban center. ===Rediscovery=== A lithograph of Tjandi Sewoe ruins near Prambanan, circa 1859 Although buried deep beneath the volcanic debris around Mount Merapi, the temple ruins were not completely forgotten by the local Javanese inhabitants. However, the origins of the temple were a mystery. Over the centuries, tales and legends infused with myths of giants and a cursed princess were recounted by villagers. Prambanan and Sewu were purport to be of supernatural origin, and in the legend of Loro Jonggrang they were said to have been created by a multitude of demons under the order of Bandung Bondowoso. Such tales are most likely the reason the temples were preserved through the centuries prior to the Java War (1825–1830). The local villagers dared not remove any of the temple stones, believing the ruins to be haunted by supernatural beings. In 1733, Pakubuwono II granted the Dutch merchant Cornelius Antonie Lons permission to make a sightseeing tour through the heartland of Mataram. Lons' report of this trip contains the first known extant description of the Sewu and Prambanan temples.Roy Jordaan, e Lost Gatekeepers Statues of Candi Prambanan: A Glimpse of the VOC Beginnings of Javanese Archaeology, NSC Working Paper No. 14, 2013 In the years 1806–07, the Dutch archaeologist unearthed the Sewu temples and created the first lithographs of Candi Sewu's main temple and the Perwara temple. After Britain's short-lived rule of the Dutch East Indies, Thomas Stamford Raffles included Cornelius' image of Candi Sewu in his 1817 book The History of Java. In 1825, the Belgian architect Auguste Payen created a series of Candi Sewu images. During the Java War (1825–1830) some of the temple stones were carted away and used in fortifications. In the years that followed the temples suffered from looting. Many of the Buddha statues were decapitated and the heads stolen. Some Dutch colonists stole sculptures and used them as garden ornaments, and native villagers used the foundation stones as construction material. Some of the temple's best preserved bas-reliefs, Buddha's head, and some ornaments were carried away from the site and ended up in museums and private collections abroad. Sewu main temple before reconstruction In 1867, Isidore van Kinsbergen photographed the ruins of Candi Sewu after an earthquake had caused the dome in main temple to collapse. In 1885 Jan Willem IJzerman, revising some plans of the temple complex made earlier by Cornelius, made notes regarding the temple's condition. He noted that several Buddha heads were missing. By 1978 none of the Buddha heads had survived, all of them having been looted from the site completely. In 1901 a new set of photographs was taken, sponsored by Leydie Melville. In 1908 initiated the clearing and reconstruction of the main temple, and in 1915 H. Maclaine Pont drew the reconstruction of a temples of the second row. It was de Haan who reconstructed the Perwara temples with the aid of Van Kinsbergen's photographs. Subsequently, the temple became a subject of study among archaeologists such as and in 1923. In 1950 Johannes Gijsbertus de Casparis also studied the temple. Most of the archaeologists concurred that the temple was built in the first half of ninth century. However, in 1960 an inscription discovered in Perwara temple number 202 dated the year 792, meaning that the temple was constructed a few years earlier, in the late eighth century. Later in 1981, Jacques Dumarçay conducted a thorough research of the temple. ===Contemporary events=== Since the early 20th century the temple has been slowly and carefully reconstructed, yet it has not been completely restored. There are hundreds of temple ruins, and many stones are missing. The main temple reconstruction and two of the apit temples on the east side were completed in 1993 and inaugurated by President Soeharto on 20 February 1993. The temple was severely damaged during the 2006 Yogyakarta earthquake. The structural damage was significant, and the central temple suffered the worst. Large pieces of debris were scattered about on the grounds, and cracks between stone blocks were detected. To prevent the central temple from collapsing, metal frame structures were erected on the four corners and attached to support the main temple. Although some weeks later in 2006 the site was reopened for visitors, the main temple remained closed for safety reasons. Today the metal frame has been removed, and visitors may visit and enter the main temple. The Sewu Temple often hosts the annual Vesak ceremony. ==The temple complex== Aerial view of Sewu temple complex shows Mandala pattern Candi Sewu Layout The Sewu temple complex is the largest Buddhist compound in the Prambanan area, with rectangular grounds that measure 185 meters north-south and 165 meters east-west. There is an entrance on all four cardinal points, but the main entrance is located on the east side. Each of the entrances is guarded by twin Dvarapala statues. These large guardian statues have been better preserved, and replicas can be found at Jogja Kraton. There are 249 buildings in the complex are arranged in a Mandala pattern around the main central hall. This configuration expresses the Mahayana Buddhist view of the universe. There are 240 smaller temples, called Perwara (guardian) temples, with similar designs that are arranged in four rectangular concentric rows. Two outer rows are arranged closer and consist of 168 smaller temples, while two inner rows, arranged at certain intervals, consist of 72 temples. The 249 temples located in the second precinct were all made with a square frame but varied by different statues and orientations. Many of the statues are now gone, and the arrangements on the current site are not in the original orientations. The statues are comparable to the statues of Borobudur and were likely made of bronze.Dumarçay, Jacques (1978). edited and translated by Michael Smithies, \\"Borobudur\\", pp. 46–47. Oxford University Press. . The images of Boddhisattva on wall of perwara temple Along the north-south and east-west central axis at a distance of about 200 meters, between the second and third rows of the smaller temple are located the apit (flank) temples, a couple on each cardinal point facing each other. The apit temples are the second largest temples after the main temple, however only eastern twin apit and a northern one still remain today. These smaller temples encompass a larger sanctuary that has been heavily looted. Behind the fourth row of smaller temples lies the stone paved courtyard where the main temple stood on the center. The nearby temples, Gana temple in the east and Bubrah temple in the south, are suggested as the part of greater Manjusrigrha vajradhatu mandala complex. Both temples are located around 300 metres from the Sewu main temple. There are northern and western ruins discovered around the same distance from the main temple, however the stones was too scarce for reconstruction. These temples suggested that indeed the Sewu temple compound was completed with four additional temples, located 300 metres from the main temple, which is corresponds with the mandala and the guardians of the directions concept. ==The main temple== Candi Sewu main temple at left and one of apit temple at right The main temple measures 29 meters in diameter and soars up to 30 meters high. The ground plan of the main temple is a cross- shaped 20-sided polygon. On each of the four cardinal points of the main temple, there are four structures projected outward, each with its own stairs, entrances and rooms, crowned with stupas, which form a cross-like layout. All of the structures are made from andesite stones. The main temple has five rooms, one large garbhagriha in the center and four smaller rooms in each cardinal direction. These four rooms are all connected with outer corner galleries with balustrades bordered by rows of small stupas. From the findings during the reconstruction process, it was suggested that the original design of central sanctuary only consisted of a central roomed temple surrounded by four additional structures with open portals. Doorways were added later. The portals were narrowed to create door frames on which to attach wooden doors. Some of the holes to attach doors are still visible. The doorways join the temples together into one main building with five rooms. The central chamber can be reached from the eastern room. The central chamber is larger than other rooms with a higher ceiling and a taller roof. Now all the five rooms are empty.Soetarno, Drs. R. second edition (2002). \\"Aneka Candi Kuno di Indonesia\\" (Ancient Temples in Indonesia), pp. 53–54. Dahara Prize. Semarang. . However the lotus carved stone pedestal in the central chamber suggests that the temple once contained a large bronze Buddhist statue (possible the bronze statue of Manjusri), probably reaching a height of four meters. The statue is missing, probably looted for scrap metal over the centuries. However another theory suggested that the main statue was probably constructed from several stone blocks coated with vajralepa plaster. ==See also== * Candi of Indonesia ==ReferencesExternal links== * Official site * \\"Mandala Suci Manjusrigrha\\" (Sacred Mandala of Manjusrigrha), a short documentary on Sewu Temple (in Indonesian) Category:Buddhist temples in Indonesia Category:Archaeological sites in Indonesia Category:Shailendra dynasty Category:Prambanan Category:Cultural Properties of Indonesia in Central Java Category:Religious buildings and structures in Central Java Category:8th- century Buddhist temples ","title":"Sewu"},{"id":"20515120","text":"Emmanuel Ngama (born July 1, 1992 in Bujumbura) is a Burundian football player currently playing for Atlanta Lions. == Career == He joined on 1 July 2008 from Atlético Olympic Bujumbura (Burundi) to FCV Dender EH.http://www.futbolmercado.es/Emmanuel-Ngama-44995_j.html He played only 3 games for FCV Dender EH and joined in summer 2009 to Atlanta Lions.Atlanta Lions - Players == International career == Ngama played his first international game on 6 September 2009 against Seychelles national football team.Telegramm - WM-Quali.

Its capital is Logroño. Other cities and towns in the province include Calahorra, Arnedo, Alfaro, Haro, Santo Domingo de la Calzada, and Nájera. It has an estimated population of 315,675 inhabitants (INE 2018), making it the least populated region of Spain. It covers part of the Ebro valley towards its north and the Iberian Range in the south. The community is a single province, so there is no County Council, and it is organized into 174 municipalities. It borders the Basque Country (province of Álava) to the north, Navarre to the northeast, Aragón to the southeast (province of Zaragoza), and Castilla y León to the west and south (provinces of Burgos and Soria). The area was once occupied by pre-Roman Berones, Pellendones and Vascones. After partial recapture from the Muslims in the early tenth century, the region became part of the Kingdom of Pamplona, later being incorporated into Castile after a century and a half of disputes. From the eighteenth century the Rioja region remained divided between the provinces of Burgos and Soria, until in 1833 the province of Logroño was created, changing the name of the province to La Rioja in 1980 as a prelude to its constitution under a single provincial autonomous community in 1982. The name \\"Rioja\\" (from Río Oja) is first attested in 1099. The region is well known for its wines under the brand Denominación de Origen Calificada Rioja. ==History== Santa María de la Redonda Co-cathedral, Logroño. Monasterios de San Millán de Yuso ===Roman and Muslim periods=== In Roman times the territory of La Rioja was inhabited by the tribes of the Berones (central country), Autrigones (upper country, extending also north and west of it) and the Vascones (lower country, extending also north and east of it). It was part of the province of Hispania Tarraconensis. In medieval times La Rioja was often a disputed territory. The Visigoths created the Duchy of Cantabria that probably included most of La Rioja, as a border march against the Vascones. After the Muslim invasion of AD 711, La Rioja fell into the Muslim domains of Al Andalus. ===Medieval period=== Most of the territory was reconquered in 923 by Sancho I of Pamplona, acting for the Kingdom of Pamplona together with the Kingdom of León and the Counts of Castile, feudal lords of the Leonese King. The lower region around Arnedo came under control of his allies the Banu Qasi of Tudela. The territory to the east of the Leza River remained under Muslim control. Later there was a dispute between Count Fernán González of Castile and the kings of Pamplona-Navarra, involving great battles. It was decided in favour of the Navarrese after the imprisonment of the Count's family in Cirueña, in 960. La Rioja briefly formed the independent Kingdom of Viguera from 970 to about 1005, at which point it became a part of the Kingdom of Pamplona. Sancho Garcés moved the capital of the Kingdom of Pamplona to Nájera (La Rioja), creating the so-called kingdom of Nájera-Pamplona which was, due to its large size, the first Spanish Empire. After the independence of Castile in 1035, this new kingdom fiercely fought against Pamplona for the possession of Bureba, La Rioja and other territories. In 1076, after the murder of Sancho IV, Navarre was divided among Castile and Aragon. Castile obtained La Rioja, together with other Navarrese lands. The name \\"La Rioja\\" first appears in written records in the Miranda de Ebro charter of 1099. The territory was centred on the fortified site of Logroño: the 12th-century church Iglesia de Santa Maria de Palacio recalls its origin as a chapel of the administrative palace. Logroño was a borderland disputed between the kings of Navarre and the kings of Castile from the 10th century; From 1134 the Navarrese under García Ramírez (\\"the Restorer\\") and his son Sancho VI (\\"the Wise\\") fought bitterly with Castile for the recovery of the former Pamplonese domains. The region was awarded to Castile in a judgement by Henry II of England and annexed in 1177. Its importance lay in part in the pilgrimage route to Santiago de Compostela, the Camino de Santiago, which crossed the River Ebro on the stone bridge, the Puente de Piedra. Arnedillo, in La Rioja ===Province of Logroño=== Map of La Rioja by Tomás López de Vargas Machuca, year 1769 Up to the 19th century the territory remained divided between the provinces of Burgos and Soria. The region was taken by Napoleonic forces in the Peninsular War and remained solidly in French hands until 1814. In the 1810 project of Llorente it was to be a part of the prefecture of Arlanzón with its capital in Burgos. The Cortes of Cádiz declared La Rioja an independent province at the time of the Liberal Constitution of 1812, and during the Liberal Triennium in January 1822 the province of Logroño was created by royal decree as part of the administrative reform of Riego, taking in the whole of the historical territory of La Rioja. However, Ferdinand VII soon annulled these decisions and restored most of the previous territorial divisions. In the 1833 reorganization, a province of Logroño was again formed within the region of Castilla la Vieja. The province increased its territory temporarily in 1841. ===Autonomous community=== In 1980 the province changed its name to La Rioja, and following the adoption of the Estatuto de San Millán in 1982, during the reorganization following the Spanish transition to democracy, it was constituted as a uni-provincial autonomous community,. Statute of Autonomy (in Spanish) It is the second- smallest autonomous community in Spain and has the smallest population; half of its 174 municipalities have populations under 200. Nearly half of its citizens live in the capital. ==Geography== View of La Rioja La Rioja is bordered by the Basque Country (province of Álava), Navarre, Aragón (province of Zaragoza), and Castile and León (provinces of Soria and Burgos). The river Ebro flows through this region, as does the river Oja, after which it is named. thumb450pxLa Rioja and its seven valleys. Drawing by Ernesto Reiner. The Ebro runs through the north of the community. The entire right bank (which is to the south) belongs to La Rioja. There are only three municipalities, Briñas, San Vicente de la Sonsierra and Ábalos on the left bank (known as the Riojan Sonsierra), although Logroño, Agoncillo, Alcanadre, Rincón de Soto and Alfaro also have parts of their respective municipal territories on that bank. Because of their proximity, the Álava area between the Ebro and the Sierra de Cantabria is called Rioja Alavesa. ===Climate=== The climate is mainly continental. The Rioja Alta comarca receives more precipitation than Rioja Baja. The average temperature ranges from and the precipitation ranges between as an annual average. The wind called Cierzo is very frequent around La Rioja during the winter. ===Mountains and mountain ranges=== The mountains in La Rioja are part of the Iberian System. This mountain range extends to the south of the Ebro river, parallel to it at a distance of about , with altitudes ranging between . From the mountain range the Sierra de la Demanda runs northwards, into the heart of La Rioja, incorporating Monte San Lorenzo which, at , is the highest peak in the province. Other mountains include Sierra de Camero Viejo, Sierra de Camero Nuevo, Sierra de Cebollera, and Picos de Urbión. ===Hydrography=== The river Ebro in La Rioja Footprints of a Theropoda found near Enciso. The Ebro is the main river passing through the community. Emerging from the narrow channel between the rocks of the Conchas de Haro, it reaches La Rioja, through which it runs for , before continuing its journey to the Mediterranean. In the Conchas de Haro the altitude of the river is and when it leaves the community, in the Sotos del Ebro Natural Reserve in Alfaro, it is high. The river therefore flows very quickly through La Rioja. Seven rivers descend rapidly towards the Ebro from the mountain range, which is why La Rioja is sometimes called: \\"Zone of the seven valleys\\". They are, from east to west, Alhama, Cidacos, Leza, Iregua, Najerilla, Oja and Tirón, although the headwaters of the Alhama and Cidacos originate in Soria and those of Najerilla-Neila and Tirón are from Burgos. Sometimes Linares (a tributary of Alhama) is added, grouping Tirón with its tributary, the Oja. All the rivers of these valleys form tributaries that go on to form many valleys in their own right, such as those of Linares, Ocon, Jubera, Tuerto, Brieva, Viniegras and San Millán. There is an almost unlimited number of grandiose canyons, quite splendid in nature, such as Aguas Buenas, Nieva, Manzanares, Ardancha, Navajún, Valderresa, Ollora, Tobia, San Martín and others. ===Flora and fauna=== In the highlands oaks, beech and pine are grown. There are also thickets of juniper, boxwood, sloes, holly and cistus. Thyme, rosemary, common juniper, and holm oak are present. There are grand hillsides with fine pasture for livestock, cattle and sheep. In the lower areas there are oaks, olive and almond trees. Near the Ebro, in the plains, the land is used for cereal, sugar beet and potatoes, while the hills are covered with vast vineyards of the wine that has brought worldwide fame to this region. All Riojan rivers, including the Ebro, have a row of poplars and cottonwood. About the Riojan Alamos Ana Maria Matute has written: \\"... see them on the edge of the water, turning the landscape, like spears magical pointing towards the unreal and mysterious country of the riverbed.\\" ===Natural resources=== Gypsum and silica are mined. Arnedillo is a spa town. ===Dinosaur footprints=== During the Early Cretaceous period the geographical area of Cameros was part of a flooded plain that drained periodically, leaving behind muddy areas where dinosaur tracks marked the path. Eventually they were dried and covered with new sediment layers whose weight pressed down on the lower layers, causing them to solidify into rocks over millions of years. Erosion has been wearing down the upper layers making many of these rock formations visible, bringing into view the fossilized footprints. La Rioja is notable for the number and conservation of these sites, in addition to those found in the north of Soria, such as Yanguas, Santa Cruz de Yanguas and other highland locations. ===Comarcas=== 400px Geographical comarcas: * Rioja Alta ** Comarca de Anguiano ** Comarca de Ezcaray ** Comarca de Haro ** Comarca de Nájera ** Comarca de Santo Domingo de la Calzada * Rioja Media ** Tierra de Cameros *** Camero Nuevo *** Camero Viejo ** Comarca de Logroño * Rioja Baja ** Comarca de Cervera ** Comarca de Alfaro ** Comarca de Arnedo ** Comarca de Calahorra ==Economy== Glasses of wine for tasting in the Vivancos Museum Power station at Arrúbal, La Rioja The Gross domestic product (GDP) of the autonomous community was 8.5 billion euros in 2018, accounting for 0.7% of Spanish economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 29,200 euros or 97% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 102% of the EU average. La Rioja is known for its production of Rioja DOCa wines (although the Rioja viticultural region extends slightly into the neighboring administrative regions of Álava and Navarra). ===Agriculture=== There is dryland farming of wheat, barley and grape; irrigated cultivation of asparagus, capsicum and other crops; and animal husbandry of sheep. Battle of Wine in Haro (La Rioja) ===Industry=== Types of industry include wine production and conserves (in Logroño, Cenicero, Haro and Calahorra); textiles and footwear (in Logroño, Arnedo, Cervera del Río Alhama and Ezcaray); furniture manufacturing (in Ezcaray, Logroño and Nájera); rubber, plastics, chemical products and transport machinery; and chorizo, made in Casalarreina. Exports are directed mostly towards the European Union, United States and Canada. ==Demography== Toro de fuego in Haro According to the INE the population of La Rioja (as at 2018) is 315,675 inhabitants, with 155,758 men and 159,917 women. Its population density is 62.57 people per km2. It is the least populous autonomous community in Spain. Its capital, Logroño, with approximately 151,113 inhabitants, is its most populous city. La Rioja has 174 municipalities. According to the same INE data, there are more men than women in 150 of them, in two the numbers are the same and in 22 there are more females than males. In the latter set, the differences are small, except in the capital where there are 4,868 more women than men. ==Major cities== { class=\\"infobox\\" style=\\"text-align:center; width:97%; margin-right:10px; font-size:90%\\" + align=center style=\\"font- weight:bold\\"  Largest cities or towns in La Rioja - ! rowspan=22  Logroño Logroño Calahorra Calahorra Arnedo Arnedo Haro Haro Lardero Lardero Alfaro Alfaro - ! align=center f5f5f5;\\"  Rank ! align=center f5f5f5;\\"  City ! align=center f5f5f5;\\"  Pop. ! align=center f5f5f5;\\"  Rank ! align=center f5f5f5;\\"  City ! align=center f5f5f5;\\"  Pop. ! rowspan=16  Nájera Nájera Villamediana de Iregua Villamediana de Iregua Santo Domingo de la Calzada Santo Domingo de la Calzada Autol Autol Pradejón Pradejón -  align=center f0f0f0;\\"  1 align=left  Logroño  151 113  align=\\"center\\" f0f0f0;\\"  15 align=left  Navarrete  2 952 -  align=center f0f0f0;\\"  2 align=left  Calahorra 23 923  align=\\"center\\" f0f0f0;\\"  16 align=left  Aldeanueva de Ebro  2 732 -  align=center f0f0f0;\\"  3 align=left  Arnedo  14 815  align=\\"center\\" f0f0f0;\\"  17 align=left  Alberite  2 433 -  align=center f0f0f0;\\"  4 align=left  Haro  11 309  align=\\"center\\" f0f0f0;\\"  18  align=left  Cervera del Río Alhama  2 298 -  align=center f0f0f0;\\"  5 align=left  Lardero  10 193  align=\\"center\\" f0f0f0;\\"  19 align=left Cenicero 2 036 -  align=center f0f0f0;\\"  6 align=left  Alfaro  9 460  align=\\"center\\" f0f0f0;\\"  20 align=left Quel 2 032 -  align=center f0f0f0;\\"  7 align=left  Nájera 8 047  align=\\"center\\" f0f0f0;\\"  21 align=left Ezcaray 2 027 -  align=center f0f0f0;\\"  8 align=left  Villamediana de Iregua  7 973  align=\\"center\\" f0f0f0;\\"  22 align=left  Murillo de Río Leza  1 654 -  align=center f0f0f0;\\"  9 align=left  Santo Domingo de la Calzada  6 231  align=\\"center\\" f0f0f0;\\"  23 align=left  Baños de Río Tobía  1 559 -  align=center f0f0f0;\\"  10 align=left  Autol  4 469  align=\\"center\\" f0f0f0;\\"  24 align=left  Entrena  1 519 -  align=center f0f0f0;\\"  11 align=left  Pradejón  3 822  align=\\"center\\" f0f0f0;\\"  25 align=left  Casalarreina  1 145 -  align=center f0f0f0;\\"  12 align=left  Rincón de Soto  3 722  align=center f0f0f0;\\"  26 align=left  San Asensio  1 124 -  align=center f0f0f0;\\"  13  align=left  Albelda de Iregua  3 462  align=\\"center\\" f0f0f0;\\"  27 align=left  Agoncillo  1 105 -  align=center f0f0f0;\\"  14 align=left  Fuenmayor  3 108  align=\\"center\\" f0f0f0;\\"  28 align=left  San Vicente de la Sonsierra  1 015 -  colspan=\\"22\\" align=center f5f5f5;\\" Source: INE 2018 } ==Education== According to the 2007 PISA report, education in La Rioja is of the highest quality in Spain, close to that of other European countries with better overall educational levels in terms of student knowledge. In the Ministry of Education's 2009 report La Rioja was in first position among the autonomous communities as it relates to general aspects of primary and secondary education. It is placed above the Spanish average in the list of communities with the lowest levels of school failure, with 85% of students being able to obtain the ESO title, despite its schools having the highest proportion of enrolled immigrants. 6,208 euros are spent per pupil, making it the tenth ranked community in this regard. The majority of educational institutions in the community are public, followed by subsidized and private schools, the latter of which are very scarce at the primary and secondary levels. The bachillerato is free in public schools and at a cost in charter schools. In La Rioja the portion of the population with higher education is 30.6%, with two institutions offering studies at this level: the University of La Rioja (UR) and an online university, the International University of La Rioja (UNIR).Website of UNIR - International University of La Rioja.

Rail journeys to Madrid, Zaragoza, Barcelona, Valladolid, Oviedo, Bilbao, La Coruña, Vigo are possible, since the Castejón-Miranda line crosses the region from east to west. The main railway station is that at Logroño. Road communications between La Rioja and neighboring regions are primarily through the AP-68. Additional highways have been built, such as the Autovía A-12 which connects Pamplona to Logroño since 2006, and in the future will reach Burgos. Other major road routes include: *N-111 *N-232 *N-120 *Autopista AP-69 (proposed) *Piqueras Tunnel *Puerto de Oncala *Puerto de Piqueras ==Government and politics== The current President of La Rioja is Concha Andreu of PSOE.

It was invented and patented in 1954 by George H. Royer.Royer oscillator circuit United States Patent 2783384 It has the advantages of simplicity, low component count, rectangle waveforms, and easy transformer isolation. By making maximum use of the transformer core, it also minimises the size and weight of the transformer. The classic Royer circuit outputs square waves. There is another converter design often described as a \\"resonant Royer\\" which generates sinewaves. This was, apparently, first described in 1959 by Baxandall and therefore should be called the \\"Baxandall converter\\". Its differences are explained below. Both versions are widely used, mainly as power inverters. == Circuit description == Royer oscillator circuit DC–AC inverter The Royer circuit consists of a saturable-core transformer with a center-tapped primary winding, a feedback winding and (optionally) a secondary winding. The two halves of the primary are driven by two transistors in push-pull configuration. The feedback winding couples a small amount of the transformer flux back in to the transistor bases to provide positive feedback, generating oscillation. The oscillation frequency is determined by the maximum magnetic flux density, the power supply voltage, and the inductance of the primary winding. The basic Royer generates square wave output.Pressman et al., p. 266 The need to use a saturable-core limits the choice of core material. Some common materials are: {  - ! Core material !! Saturation Flux Density / G !! Core Losses W/cm3 at 50 kHz -  Toshiba MB  6000  0.49 -  Metglas2714A  6000  0.62 -  Square Permalloy 80 (0.5 mil)  7800  0.98 -  Square Permalloy 80 (1 mil)  7800  4.2 -  Ferrite Type 84  4000  4 } === Current mode operation === A drawback of the voltage mode operation is that the stress on switch transistors is high during the cross over time, when both the voltage and current are high. This drawback is alleviated by using current mode operation. This is achieved by inserting an inductor in the transformer center tap supply. This inductor drops the center tap voltage down when the dI/dt would be very high in voltage mode. This improved version is called current-fed Royer oscillator in some books.Pressman et al., p. 271 == Applications (and sine-wave variants) == The classic Royer oscillator circuit (with or without current drive) is used in some DC–AC inverters where square wave output is acceptable for the load. It was also heavily used in the 1970s in switching power supplies (by rectifying the output) and typically implemented with bipolar transistors. This circuit relies solely on transformer core saturation to cause switching between the two states. 300px Sinewave variant There are three major differences between the Royer converter and Baxandall's resonant design, though the literature is mixed http://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/MAX1739-MAX1839.pdfEDN letter exchange \\"A Royer by any other name\\" between Bryce Hesterman and Jim Williams. Published on 21 November 1996.. Firstly, the sinewave circuit adds a capacitor in parallel with the centre tapped transformer primary, which forms a resonant LC (\\"tank\\") circuit. Secondly, an inductor is connected in series with the supply voltage to the transformer primary tap. These components change the nature of the circuit completely from the Royer design. When one transistor is on, its collector voltage is near zero, limited by the saturation voltage. It operates with a constant current, set by the inductor. The current in the primary of the transformer splits into two parts, each side conducting half a sinewave but in anti-phase, and each with an average, or d.c. offset, of half the supply voltage. The opposing currents always balance but the whole primary \\"sees\\" the complete sinewave. In this manner, a sinewave is able to be generated while allowing the transistors to switch alternately fully on and off in push-pull mode. This is the only resemblance to the Royer converter. The centre tap voltage swings up and down as the inductor opposes current change. As a result the waveform appears much like a full-wave rectifier. The d.c. supply voltage equates to the average, so the tap peaks at approximately (pi/2)*Vcc. As the transformer acts like a 2:1 autotransformer on the primary, the \\"off\\" transistor collector voltage reaches double, or pi times Vcc. Finally the third major difference is that the transformer does not, or should not, saturate. Switching between the two transistors is brought about simply through the resonating primary changing polarity every half cycle. A circuit of this type was used for example in driving the CRT of the Tektronix 547 oscilloscope. A circuit employing a similar idea appears in a 1973 patent assigned to Bell Telephone LaboratoriesUnited States Patent 3818314 Fig. 3 and as mentioned, in a 1959 conference paper by P.J. Baxandall,P.J. Baxandall, \\"Transistor Sine-Wave LC Oscillators\\", International Convention on Transistors and Associated Semiconductor Devices, 25 May 1959, fig 5, p. 751who provided a clear description of its operation. The Baxandall converter has been used recently in driving fluorescent tubes from low voltage sources, often using rechargeable batteries, for emergency lighting and camping etc. Also in his 1959 paper, Baxandall described a voltage-switched variant of the sinewave oscillator. This variant seems to have been the forerunner of most two- transistor drivers for compact fluorescent lamps (CFL's) and which has been extended recently to drive low voltage LED lamps too. Another application of the Baxandall converter is in powering CCFLs. CCFLs exhibit a degradation in their current-to-light output efficiency in the presence of harmonics, so the resonant circuit is the one used to drive them.Williams (1998), p. 157 In order to provide light intensity adjustment, an integrated circuit typically drives a pulse-width modulated signal in the gate of an additional transistor, forming a step-down converter with the feeding choke. (includes UCC3973 data sheet) Other integrated circuits control also the two oscillator transistors and sense the zero valley of the transformer mid tap to do this.

It is located about 130 metres north east from Kalasan temple. The temple was a two-story building with wooden beams, floors, stairs completed with windows and doors; all from organic materials which now are decayed and gone. It is suggested that the original function of this building was a vihara (Buddhist monastery), a dwelling place for monks.The information board at the Sari Temple vicinity The temple's name Sari or Saré translates as \\"to sleep\\" in Javanese, which also confirms the habitation nature of the building. ==History== Historians suggested that the temple was built around the same time as the Kalasan temple. The Kalasan inscription dated 778 AD, in Pranagari script written in Sanskrit, mentions that the temple was erected by the will of Guru Sang Raja Sailendravamçatilaka (the Jewel of the Shailendra dynasty) who succeeded in persuading Maharaja Tejapurnapana Panangkaran (in other parts of the inscription also called as Kariyana Panangkaran) to construct a holy building for the boddhisattva Tara and also build a vihara (monastery) for Buddhist monks from Sailendra family's realm. Panangkaran awarded the Kalara village to the Sangha (the Buddhist monastic community).Soetarno, Drs. R. second edition (2002). Aneka Candi Kuno di Indonesia (Ancient Temples in Indonesia), pp. 41. Dahara Prize. Semarang. . Based on this inscription, Candi Sari was probably the monastery for monks who served the nearby Kalasan temple. The ruins were discovered in early 1920s, and in 1929, an effort to reconstruct the temple began and was finished in 1930. However it was incomplete because many parts are missing including the outer base that surrounds the temple, and the extended front room and front stairs that once projected from the east wall of the temple. ==Architecture== The temple consists of three parts; the base, the body, and the roof. The temple has a rectangular plan, measuring 17.3 m north-south, 10 m west-east, and soaring 17 m in height. Only some parts of the base remain, the outer base stoneblocks are missing. The entrance door is located at the eastern side with a gate adorned with a Kala and elephant carving. Windows surround the walls and consist of lower and upper rows. There is also a horizontal middle \\"belt\\" line around the wall, suggesting that it was a two-storey building. The interior consists of three rooms; north room, central room, and south room, each measuring 3 m x 5.8 m. These three rooms are connected with doorways on the eastern side of the room along the north-south axis. On the wall of each room are found rows of extruding stone blocks which used to support wooden beams and a wooden ceiling separating the upper and lower floors. In some places there are diagonal stones which is probably the place where there used to be a wooden stairway. Photo of Candi Sari (1901) by Christiaan Benjamin Nieuwenhuis The upper level was probably used by monks for meditation or worship. Some suggest the upper rooms were used as the place for monks to stay, rest, or sleep, while the lower rooms was the place for worship. In the lower rooms there are some elevated parts where statues were once placed, but now the statues are gone. On the side walls are found niches, probably to place oil lamps. In the inner part of each window there are holes to install wooden window bars. These rooms were topped with three horse-shoe arched niches adorned with Kala-makaras and crowned with three rows of stupas. Between these arched niches are found rain-water drainage and \\"jaladwara\\" water spouts taking the form of a giant sitting on a snake. The outer wall is richly decorated with Buddhist deities. External decoration include Tara with flowers and Bodhisattvas with musical instruments. These figures are arranged in two upper and two lower rows and placed on each side of the windows. They form a total of 36 statues: 8 on the east, north, and south sides respectively, and 12 on the west side. These Buddhist figures are usually found in the graceful position of Tribhanga, holding red or blue lotuses and displaying peaceful and serene facial expressions. Images of Kinnara-Kinnari also adorn the walls. However, unlike the common depiction of Kinnara as heavenly creature with an upper human-shaped part and a lower bird-shaped part, the unusual image of Kinnara found on the northern wall shows a winged deity (somewhat similar to how commonly angels are portrayed). On the outer wall of the temple are found the traces of plaster called vajralepa (lit: diamond plaster). The same substance is also found in the nearby Kalasan temple. The white-yellowish plaster was applied to protect the temple wall, but now the plaster has worn off. ==See also== * Candi of Indonesia ==ReferencesExternal links== * Sari Temple * location on wikimapia. * Official site * Article with photos from borobudur.tv Category:Archaeological sites in Indonesia Category:Buddhist temples in Indonesia Category:Shailendra dynasty Category:Cultural Properties of Indonesia in Yogyakarta Category:Prambanan Category:8th-century Buddhist temples ","title":"Sari temple"},{"id":"20515271","text":"Madhyeharsahi is a village development committee in Sunsari District in the Kosi Zone of south-eastern Nepal.

The Town is yet to have any prominent business house but is a growing market with a number of small industries, hotels and shops. Being linked with some major cities Dharan & Itahari of the Sunsari District, this Town holds a very good chance of development. There is one community radio station also, named Sunsari FM… There are number of schools and a higher secondary school in the Town and almost all the children go to primary school and higher school.

In the recording studio, Parker writes, records, performs, and produces all of the project's music. As a touring act, Tame Impala consists of Parker (guitar, vocals), Dominic Simper (guitar, synthesiser), Jay Watson (synthesiser, vocals, guitar), Cam Avery (bass guitar, vocals), and Julien Barbagallo (drums, vocals). The group has a close affiliation with fellow Australian psychedelic rock band Pond, sharing members and collaborators, including Nick Allbrook, formerly a live member of Tame Impala. Originally signed to Modular Recordings, Tame Impala is now signed to Interscope Records in the US, and Fiction Records in the UK. Parker originally conceived the project in Perth in 2007. After a series of singles and EPs, Tame Impala's debut studio album, Innerspeaker, was released in 2010; it was certified gold in Australia and well received by critics. Parker's 2012 follow-up, Lonerism, was also acclaimed, reaching platinum status in Australia and receiving a Grammy Award nomination for Best Alternative Music Album. Tame Impala's third album, Currents, was released in July 2015, and like its predecessor, it won ARIA Awards for Best Rock Album and Album of the Year. Parker won the APRA Award for Song of the Year 2016 for Currents first track, \\"Let It Happen\\". The fourth and most recent studio album, The Slow Rush, was released 14 February 2020. ==History2007–2008: Early career=== The origins of the act can be found in the Perth music scene. Parker played in a number of bands, one being the Dee Dee Dums, a rock duo that consisted of Parker (guitar) and Luke Epstein (drums). Tame Impala emerged in 2007 as a Kevin Parker home-recording project in this period and he posted a number of tracks on Myspace. This brought interest from a number of labels and eventually, he signed a worldwide deal with the independent Modular Recordings in July 2008. To transfer these recordings to a live-stage, Parker enlisted the help of Dominic Simper (bass) and Jay Watson (drums) and began playing at some local gigs. ===2008–2009: Tame Impala EP=== V Festival in Perth, Western Australia The signing was soon followed by the release of their self-titled EP in September 2008. It reached the number 1 position on the Australian Independent Record Labels (AIR) Chart and number 10 on the ARIA Physical Singles Chart, with three songs, \\"Desire Be, Desire Go\\", \\"Half Full Glass of Wine\\" and \\"Skeleton Tiger\\" receiving national radio airplay on the Triple J radio station. Tours in 2008 included supports for You Am I, The Black Keys, Yeasayer and MGMT, as well as performances at Southbound Festival, Meredith Music Festival and Falls Festival, and national headline tours in support of their EP. Tours in 2009 included a sold-out six-date \\"Skeleton Tiger\\" national headline tour and a five-date UK tour (including Nevereverland UK), as well as performances at V Festival and Groovin The Moo, and a stadium tour with The Living End and Gyroscope. Tame Impala appeared on Triple J's Hottest 100 list in 2008—their first appearance on the list—with \\"Half Full Glass of Wine\\" at number 75. The song is also on the Hottest 100 compilation album. ===2009–2010: \\"Sundown Syndrome\\"=== Parker in April 2009 during a performance at Somerville Auditorium Tame Impala's first single, \\"Sundown Syndrome\\", was recorded at Toerag Studios in London, UK, with recording engineer Liam Watson, while the band was in the UK in March 2009. \\"Sundown Syndrome\\" was premiered by Richard Kingsmill on his \\"2009\\" show on Triple J on Sunday 10 May 2009. The song was released in July 2009 on vinyl, and digitally with a cover of \\"Remember Me\\" by DJ Blue Boy. The band then headlined the inaugural \\"Rottofest\\" in August 2009, an annual comedy, film and music festival held on Rottnest Island off the coast of Western Australia. Following Rottofest, they embarked on a national tour through September and October 2009 in support of the single. \\"Remember Me\\" appeared at number 78 on Triple J's Hottest 100 for 2009. \\"Sundown Syndrome\\" was included on the soundtrack of the Oscar-nominated film The Kids Are All Right. \\"Half Full Glass of Wine\\" was used in HBO's popular television series Entourage as the closing song for an episode. Tame Impala appeared at the Australian/New Zealand Big Day Out festival in early 2010, performing alongside bands such as Muse, The Mars Volta, Kasabian and Rise Against. ===2010: Innerspeaker=== Tame Impala performing at Red Rocks Amphitheatre in June 2010 Tame Impala's debut album Innerspeaker was released on 21 May 2010. In the UK the official release date was 28 June, but iTunes accidentally made it available for purchase on 12 May. The album was released in the United States on 8 June to general and critical acclaim. Pitchfork named it Best New Music. In an interview with Triple J talking about the album's nomination for the J Award, Parker stated that they had secretly been recording a new album. \\"Jay and I have been recording pretty compulsively and album number two is nearing potential completion already and I'm so excited about it that I'm having trouble keeping myself from telling you all about it\\". This came only months after Innerspeaker was released. The group toured in mid-2010, commencing the Innerspeaker album tour on 13 May 2010 as the opening act for MGMT's 2010 American tour. The band returned to Australia to play at Splendour in the Grass festival, which was followed by a European Tour in July (including an appearance at the Reading Festival) and a national Australian tour in October. In November they returned to the UK and Europe for a fifteen date tour, including their largest London headline show to date which was attended by Noel Gallagher, Tom Meighan, Sergio Pizzorno, Noel Fielding, Alexa Chung and Alison Mosshart, the band then went on to the United States and Canada for twenty headline dates including sold-out shows in Toronto, New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. They also received four 2010 ARIA Music Awards nominations which include, \\"Album of the Year\\" and \\"Best Rock Album\\" for Innerspeaker, \\"Best Group\\" and also \\"Breakthrough Artist\\". On 29 November 2010, Innerspeaker won Australian youth-oriented radio network Triple J's highest honour, winning the J Award for Album of the Year. ===2011–2014: Lonerism=== Parker performing with Tame Impala in March 2011 Tame Impala's second album, Lonerism was released in 2012 and was mixed by Dave Fridmann. Parker said that Lonerism \\"represents a departure from his previous work by incorporating an expanded sonic palette, more emotional song writing, and a more pronounced narrative perspective\\". It was created in a similar set up as Innerspeaker, whereby Parker wrote and recorded the majority of the album by himself at his home in Perth, Western Australia. Parts of the recording also occurred in Parker's home studio in France. While in France, Parker produced and played on the self-titled dream pop album by Melody's Echo Chamber, the project of French singer Melody Prochet. As a result, one of the tracks on Lonerism is titled \\"Endors Toi\\", which roughly translates from French to English as \\"fall asleep\\". The album cover is a photo taken by Parker of the Jardin du Luxembourg in Paris, France, with additional editing by Leif Podhajsky, a graphic designer who created the album art for Innerspeaker. The image ties into the themes of isolation of Lonerism, with a metal gate separating the viewer from the people in the Gardens. The band released the song \\"Apocalypse Dreams\\" for free download on 7 July 2012. The first single \\"Elephant\\" was released in July 2012. The album was released on 5 October in Australia, 8 October in the United Kingdom and 9 October in the United States. StillinRock described it as the best album of the year. The album features the songs \\"Apocalypse Dreams\\" and \\"Elephant\\", which are some of the first songs that Parker has co-written with Watson. \\"Feels Like We Only Go Backwards\\" was released as the second single. Tame Impala in October 2012 In November 2012, Lonerism won the 2012 J Award for Australian Album of the Year. It was the second time Tame Impala had won the award, after also winning it for their debut album Innerspeaker in 2010. They are the first band to win the J Award more than once. In January 2013, Lonerism was selected by Rolling Stone for the 2012 Album of the Year award after the band also won the award in 2011 for Innerspeaker. It was also announced as album of the year by UK magazine NME. Additionally, Lonerism was voted number one overall in Rolling Stone, Triple J, NME, Filter, Urban Outfitters, FasterLouder and Obscure Sound's 2012 Album of the Year polls. Lonerism became the first Australian album to win NME's album of the year. \\"Elephant\\" and \\"Feels Like We Only Go Backwards\\" appeared at number 7 and 9 respectively in Triple J's Hottest 100 for 2012. The band began an international tour in 2012 through 2013, supported by The Growl. During this tour, they played major festivals, such as Coachella, Sasquatch Festival, and appeared on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon. For this tour Watson switched from drums to keyboards and Parker recruited Julien Barbagallo on drums. In September 2012, Tame Impala's first U.S. feature appeared on the cover of the publication The FADER, in its 82nd issue. On 18 May 2013, it was announced via Facebook that Allbrook would leave the band to focus on other musical endeavours, and that Cam Avery of Pond and The Growl would take his place. Allbrook played his final gig with the band on their last Australian tour date of 2013 at Perth's Belvoir Amphitheatre, the same venue that Allbrook played his first gig with the band at in 2008. As a farewell gesture, the band played a cover of Outkast's \\"Prototype\\". Lonerism received a 2014 Grammy Award nomination in December 2013 in the Best Alternative Music Album category. ===2015–2017: Currents=== Cam Avery and Kevin Parker, performing with Tame Impala in June 2014 It is believed that Parker started recording the follow-up album to Lonerism at the beginning of 2014, due to various Instagram posts that showed recording taking place at the Wave House in Western Australia, where the debut album Innerspeaker was recorded. Prior to this, Parker had been touring with Tame Impala and working on other musical projects, including his disco-funk band, AAA Aardvark Getdown Services. Parker said in May 2013: > Right now, doing another album doesn't excite me. There's something narrow- > minded about thinking an album is the only way you can put out music, > especially in the world we’re in at the moment. Anything is possible. > There's so many people doing interesting things with the internet and > technology, there could be so many ways of making music and listening to it. > It's 2013 and you can make music anywhere ... There are so many > possibilities, my brain is overloading on them all. I just need to wait, > think about things a bit more. Then I’ll know what to do next. In May 2014, Parker spoke of his growing inclination toward the recording of another album in a triple J radio interview, explaining that: \\"I'm getting more and more sucked into the world of making an album. It's weird how it happens naturally, it's almost feels like a seasonal thing. I've started to think about tracklistings and all the things that come with an album.\\" Describing the sound of the new album, Parker said \\"I'm gonna try to make it a bit more minimal this time; only use what's needed ... instead of a supreme pizza, where you just throw everything on\\". Watson added: \\"[It’s] probably gonna be less rock again and more electronic again, even more than the last one\\". Parker later stated that the inspiration behind the new polished sound of Tame Impala's third album came from listening to a Fleetwood Mac song. He said that the pureness and cleanness of Fleetwood Mac's song prompted him to attempt to create a more streamlined musical style within Currents. Tame Impala performing at Lollapalooza in September 2015 On 6 January 2015, Spinning Top Music announced that a new Tame Impala album will be released in 2015. During the same month, it was announced that the band would perform at the Boston Calling Music Festival in May 2015. On 11 March 2015, a new song entitled \\"Let It Happen\\" was released as a free download. On 5 April 2015, Tame Impala announced and released the album cover for Currents in a Facebook post. A few hours later the band released the first official single from the upcoming album on Facebook called \\"'Cause I'm a Man\\". Later that month, on 22 April 2015, Tame Impala officially released \\"Let it Happen\\" as the second single from the album. One week later, on 29 April 2015, Kevin Parker held an AMA on reddit, where he provoked fans to ask him to release a new song, then responding with \\"Disciples\\", which became the first promotion single for the upcoming album Currents. On 7 May 2015, the band announced that the album would be released in 17 July 2015 and released the third official single, \\"Eventually\\". During the same 30 April 2015 reddit AMA, Parker said, \\"Up until recently, from all of Tame Impala's record sales outside of Australia I had received.... zero dollars. Someone high up spent the money before it got to me. I may never get that money.\\" Tame Impala performing at Red Rocks Amphitheatre in August 2016 In October 2017, a Collector's Edition of Currents was announced. Released on 17 November, it included three B-sides and two remixes. ===2018: Other projects=== By the end of 2017, Tame Impala announced that they agreed to play the 2018 Mad Cool musical concert in Spain, which would be the first live music show the band agreed to play in 2018.Luke Morgan Britton,\\"Tame Impala announce live return\\", NME, 14 December 2017 Tame Impala also played a headline set at London's Citadel Festival in July 2018. In July 2018, during an interview with Beats 1 anchor host Matt Wilkinson, Parker confirmed for the first time that he had begun working on a new Tame Impala album, adding that he was \\"ready to play some other songs live\\" and expressing an interest to headline a stage at Glastonbury Festival in 2019. He also stated that he would be \\"very disappointed\\" if the new record by Tame Impala wasn't released by summer 2019. On 1 July 2018, Tame Impala teamed up with artist ZHU to create the single \\"My Life\\". In October 2018, Parker played bass for rapper Travis Scott for a performance of \\"Skeletons/Astrothunder\\" on Saturday Night Live, with singer-songwriter John Mayer also part of the backing band. On 10 October, the band was scheduled to headline the first night of the annual Desert Daze festival in its new location in Moreno Beach, but had to cut their set short after three songs due to inclement weather. On 14 October, female R&B; singer SZA released the single \\"Together\\" on YouTube, which is billed as \\"SZA featuring Tame Impala.\\" Later that month, on 31 October, rapper Theophilus London released a new single in collaboration with Tame Impala under the moniker of Theo Impala. ===2019–present: The Slow Rush=== Tame Impala performing at Primavera Sound 2019 On 2 January 2019, Tame Impala was announced as a headliner for the 2019 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. They also headlined the 2020 Primavera Sound festival, making them only the second Australian act to do so. Around the same time, Parker announced that he expected to release a new album during that summer. The 2020 album is named The Slow Rush and features 12 tracks recorded in Los Angeles and in Parker's hometown of Fremantle, Australia. On 21 March, Tame Impala released the single \\"Patience\\", and has teased new music on Instagram for the forthcoming album. They were the musical guest for Saturday Night Live on 30 March, with host Sandra Oh. On the show, the band performed \\"Patience\\" and a new song, \\"Borderline\\", which was released 12 April. On 25 October, Tame Impala revealed the title of their fourth studio album, The Slow Rush. Three days later on 28 October, they released the song \\"It Might Be Time\\". On 3 December, Tame Impala released the single \\"Posthumous Forgiveness\\". The album was released on 14 February 2020. Josh Terry of Vice named Tame Impala his \\"Artist of the Decade\\" for the 2010s, writing, \\"No artist captured how genres cross-pollinated throughout the 2010s better than Tame Impala\\". He added: \\"In the age of streaming and the big-box festival bubble, Parker's discography seems factory-made for both a crowd of thousands and a chill night alone with a vibe-heavy playlist\\" and that \\"his music embodies the technology-driven sense of loneliness of this decade better than any of his peers\\". \\"The Less I Know the Better\\" was voted number one in Triple J's Hottest 100 of the Decade on 14 March 2020. This was the highest ranking for Tame Impala in a Hottest 100 Countdown and the first the project had attained number one in any Hottest 100 (the same song had previously placed fourth in the 2015 Hottest 100). On 20 March 2020, Parker appeared on The Weeknd's album After Hours, producing and providing background vocals on a track called \\"Repeat After Me (Interlude)\\". ==Musical style== Tame Impala performing in 2014 Parker's decision to make the music for Tame Impala in the studio by himself is a result of Parker liking \\"the kind of music that is the result of one person constructing an awesome symphony of sound. You can layer your own voice 700 times for half a second if you want, and I just love that kind of music\\". However, Parker has to translate his music to a live setting with the band, and the band doesn't play the songs until they have been recorded. \\"The only jamming that's done as a band is done a long time after the song is recorded for the sake of the live environment. It's good for us, because we can take a song that's been recorded and do what we want to it: slow it down, speed it up, make it 10 seconds or 10 minutes long. It gives us a lot of freedom.\\" Some favoured and often-used effects by Parker include phasing, delay, reverb and fuzz. Experimentation with different effects pedals such as Roland RE-20 Space Echo, has led to Parker creating new and unique sounds. \\"If you make an effort to not put the pedals in the order you're meant to, then you'll end up with something new sounding. We don't have any things that we got from another planet or anything, it's the same things everyone else has used.\\" \\"People have a distortion pedal and then a reverb pedal. A reverb is meant to make it sound like it's in a cathedral or something. If you put it the other way around, it won't sound like a guitar being played in a church, it'll sound like a church being stuffed inside a shoebox and then exploded. You can do different things just by treating things differently.\\" Parker's process for making music is \\"I’ll have a sudden, spontaneous vision of a song, have all the parts mapped out in mind, and do my best to record it as quick as I can. I’ll find my eight-track and do a quick demo of just the riff, or a verse or a chorus. The song will go for like 30 seconds. I’ll have a whole bunch of them [demos] and then I’ll just choose which ones to make into full songs\\". Parker has a strong sense of melody in his music, having composed \\"excessively melodic music from about the age of 12 to 15\\". For Parker, the music comes before the lyrics, \\"I usually write the lyrics after the melody and its timing have been decided. But the words have to be meaningful. I try to synchronise certain words with the best parts of the melody, but it can be really difficult and does my head in. I like to keep the meaning pretty open and ambiguous so that it's not just me that gets something out of the lyrics. I usually write lyrics from a persona rather than tell a specific story.\\" Parker also said \\"Usually I am sufficiently motivated to think of new songs everyday, but I usually forget them. I seem to get an emotional kick out of sensing feelings of general desperation or hopelessness, whether it's me or someone near me or someone in a movie or anything. It's really difficult to sit down and force yourself to write a song, and that forced nature usually comes out in the song so I just have to wait until they come to me.\\" ===Influences=== Tame Impala's music and live visuals are heavily influenced by psychedelic music. Parker's music is heavily influenced by late 1960s and early 1970s psychedelic rock, which is achieved through various production methods. Parker said that he has a \\"fetish for extremely sugary pop music\\" from artists like Britney Spears and Kylie Minogue. Parker also loves \\"fucked-up explosive cosmic music\\" in the vein of The Flaming Lips, with whom Parker collaborated on the track \\"Children of the Moon\\" in 2012, for the release The Flaming Lips and Heady Fwends. Combining these two things, My Bloody Valentine have influenced Parker's music with their contrasting combination of loud guitars and ethereal melodies. Parker has \\"always been in love with the wall of sound as employed by My Bloody Valentine\\" and he tries to capture that \\"melancholy dreamy feel\\". Parker tries to incorporate this balance into his own music. \\"If I was singing, I wouldn't be able to match the tone of the instruments, which is really crunchy. The instruments are quite sonically brutal, but the voice is really soft, and I think that kind of resonates with people. It's kind of like My Bloody Valentine, where it's really brutal sounding, but kind of beautiful at the same time\\". Tame Impala live drummer Jay Watson has described Parker's music as containing \\"shoegazey guitar sound, but not played in a shoegazey manner\\". Electronic music is another influence. Parker has used rock instrumentation in an electronic manner, saying \\"The way we do music, it's organic, but it's meant to be quite repetitive and hypnotic, almost in a kind of electronic nature. Using our playing as though it was a living sample\\". A heavy feature on Innerspeaker is a pitch-shifted guitar tone that many mistook for a synth. Parker mentioned this by saying \\"I had a few obsessions when recording Innerspeaker. One was to make the guitars sound like synths and drums sound like drum samples and pretty much anything except guitars and drums. I'm obsessed with confusing people as to the origin of a sound.\\" Parker was inspired to take up various creative endeavours at a young age, \\"I used to draw a lot when I was very young, and I used to get the most immense feeling of satisfaction from finishing a picture and looking back at it, even though I wasn't actually that good. When I started playing music I got the same feeling from making a song, even if it was just a few noises or drum patterns put together. It was all about the buzz from making something from nothing. Music always affected me greatly as a listener anyway, usually from listening to music in my dad's car or listening to him play guitar.\\" Lo-fi music is also a favourite of Parker's, and he incorporated it heavily in the early days of Tame Impala, heard prominently on the Tame Impala EP. With the release of Innerspeaker, Parker went for a different approach to a lo-fi sound, aiming more for a more cosmic and sonic wall of sound, helped by mixer Dave Fridmann. Parker explained \\"It sounds more cohesive, like an organism. It has a different emotion to it, it brings out a different feeling when it's absolutely blaring at you. I love that sound.\\" Parker has also stated that Supertramp, one of his favourite bands, are a major influence on the musical style of Tame Impala. Despite their difference in sound, he feels he is always somewhat \\"channeling Supertramp\\". He has said that listening to the Bee Gees on mushrooms inspired him to change the sound of the music he was making on Currents. ==MembersStudio=== * Kevin Parker – all vocals and instruments, production (2007–present) ===Live=== * Kevin Parker – vocals, guitar (2007–present) * Jay Watson – drums (2007–2012); synthesiser, guitar, backing vocals (2012–present) * Dominic Simper – bass guitar (2007–2010); guitar, synthesiser, keyboards (2010–present) * Julien Barbagallo – drums, backing vocals (2012–present) * Cam Avery – bass guitar, backing vocals (2013–present), synthesizer (2019–present) Former live members * Nick Allbrook – guitar, synthesiser, bass guitar (2009–2013) * Loren Humphrey – drums (2019) ===Live band timeline=Discography== *Innerspeaker (2010) *Lonerism (2012) *Currents (2015) *The Slow Rush (2020) ==Awards and nominationsReferencesExternal links== * Category:2007 establishments in Australia Category:APRA Award winners Category:ARIA Award winners Category:Brit Award winners Category:Australian psychedelic rock music groups Category:Fiction Records artists Category:Interscope Records artists Category:Modular Recordings artists Category:Musical groups established in 2007 Category:Musical groups from Perth, Western Australia Category:Neo- psychedelia groups Category:One-man bands Category:Psychedelic pop music groups ","title":"Tame Impala"},{"id":"20515320","text":"Calliope is a New York City-based band which plays Renaissance music and modern music using early musical instruments, such as the sackbut, shawm, viol, and the hurdy-gurdy.

Bordered by Andalusia, Castilla-La Mancha and the Valencian Community, the autonomous community consists of a single province. The autonomous community and the province are thus operated as one unit of government. The city of Murcia is the capital of the region and seat of government organs, except for the parliament, the Regional Assembly of Murcia, which is located in Cartagena. The autonomous community and province is subdivided into municipalities. The Region of Murcia is bordered by Andalusia (the provinces of Almería and Granada), Castile–La Mancha (the province of Albacete, which was historically connected to Murcia until 1980), the Valencian Community (province of Alicante), and the Mediterranean Sea. The community covers 11,313 km² in area and has a population of 1.4 million. About one-third of its population lives in the capital. The highest peak of the region is Los Obispos Peak, in the Massif of Revolcadores, with 2,014 m. altitude.Review Geodesic Vertex, Government of Spain (pdf) Of its extensive heritage, it is worth mentioning the 72 cave rock art ensembles belonging to the rock art of the Rock art of the Iberian Mediterranean Basin declared World Heritage Site,727 individual codes according to the list of UNESCO as well as the Council of Wise Men of the plain of Murcia, declared Intangible world cultural heritage,Las Provincias. El Tribunal de las Aguas de Valencia es designado Patrimonio Cultural Inmaterial de la Humanidad. 30 September 2009. in the same way as the Drums of Moratalla and Mula are Intangible world cultural heritage. in the region of Murcia is the town of Caravaca de la Cruz, place of reference for the worship of the Catholic Church by having the privilege of celebrating the Jubilee Year in perpetuity every seven years around the Vera Cruz de Caravaca. The region is one of the largest producers of fruits, vegetables, and flowers of Europe, with important vineyards in the municipalities of Jumilla, Bullas and Yecla, which produce wines with Denominación de origen. It also has an important tourist sector, concentrated on a coast with many virgin spaces (many of them threatened) and that has the saltwater lagoon of the Mar Menor. Its industry stands out for the petrochemical and energy sector (centred on Cartagena) and the food industry. Murcia is mainly a warm region which has made it very suitable for agriculture. However the precipitation level is low and water supply is a hot subject today since, in addition to the traditional water demand for crops, there is now also a demand of water for the booming tourist developments. Water is supplied by the Segura River and, since the 1970s, by the Tajo transvasement, a major civil engineering project which, under some environmental and sustainability restraints, brings water from the Tajo into the Segura. The Region of Murcia is a historical region of southeastern Spain, heiress of the ancient Kingdom of Murcia, which has traditionally included as biprovincial region the provinces of Albacete and Murcia. during the Transition, Albacete moved to the new Castile–La Mancha, forming the uniprovincial autonomy of the Region of Murcia. ==Toponymy and denomination== The toponym Murcia has a controversial origin. According to Francisco Cascales, this toponym could refer to the Roman goddess Venus Murcia, related to the myrtles on the banks of the Segura River; hypothesis that has been discussed in this regard. Historical studies conclude that, like the above-mentioned divinity, Murcia is a place name of Latin origin that derives very probably from Myrtea or Murtea (“place of myrtles” or “place where grow the myrtles”) and that Mursiya (first name already documented in the Islamic period to the city of Murcia) was the adaptation of the Arabic from the Latin term pre-existing. According to Bienvenido Mascaray, the name would come from the Iberian language in the form m-ur-zia, meaning \\"the water that empowers or moistens\\". as Bienvenido Mascaray, the name would come from the Iberian language in the form m-ur-zia, meaning \\"the water that soaks or moistens\\" Map of the Kingdom of Murcia in 1795 The use of this term to define the present region also has its origin in the Taifa of Murcia (Arab kingdom) that existed at different times of the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries, a political entity that served as the basis for the conquest (which took place in this area between 1243 and 1266) to also emerge the Christian kingdom of Murcia, territorial jurisdiction that came to have its own institutions and that existed until 1833. After the provincial administrative reform of that year there began to exist a first Region of Murcia formed by the provinces of Albacete and Murcia. In the first decentralizer attempt in the history of Spain during the First Republic, this region was one of the 17 member states that contemplated the Spanish Draft Constitution of 1873, proclaiming during that year the so-called Cantón Murciano as an attempt of regional canton in the context of the Cantonal rebellion. In 1978, the Regional Council of Murcia was created as a pre-autonomous body until 1982, when the Statute of Autonomy of the Region of Murcia was approved. The province of Murcia was granted autonomy under the official name of Autonomous Community of the Region of Murcia in the framework of the political process experienced during the Spanish transition. == Symbols == Map of the Kingdom of Murcia in La Geographia Blaviana by Joan Blaeu (1659). In the upper left quadrant appears the coat of arms of the kingdom, which was included in the flag and coat of arms of the Region of Murcia. The flag of the Region of Murcia is rectangular and contains four battlement castles in gold, at the upper left corner, distributed two in two (symbolizing the border character of the ancient Kingdom of Murcia and the four borders that it had at some point in its history), and seven royal crowns at the lower right angle (these being the escutcheon of the historical coat of arms of the Kingdom of Murcia), arranged in four rows, with one, three, two and one elements, respectively; all on a crimson background or Cartagena. Its origin dates back to the Spanish transition, when the president of the Regional Council of Murcia, Antonio Pérez Crespo, commissioned a commission in 1978 to study the future flag of the Region of Murcia. Commission formed by historians Juan Torres Fontes and José María Jover and senators Ricardo de la Cierva and Antonio López Pina. The project was approved on 26 March 1979 and was first hoisted on 5 May 1979 on a balcony of the Regional Council building, the former Provincial Council of Murcia (now the Ministry of Finance). The same committee established that the coat of arms of the Region of Murcia had the same symbols and distribution as the flag, with the royal crown. Flag and shield were collected in Article 4 of the Statute of Autonomy of the Region of Murcia, approved by organic law in 1982. The Day of the Region of Murcia is celebrated on 9 June, commemorating the promulgation of the Statute of Autonomy. ==Physical environmentLocation=== Satellite view of the Region of Murcia. The Region of Murcia is an autonomous community of Spain located in the southeast of the Iberian Peninsula, on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea. With 11,313 km2, it is the ninth region of Spain by area and represents 2.9% of the national extension. The Community extends over the greater part of the hydrographic basin of the Segura River, thus counting with a defined geographical unit, except for the comarcas of the Sierra de Segura and the Campos de Hellín which were in the province of Albacete, Los Vélez in Almería and La Vega Baja in the province of Alicante, all belonging to the same basin. Its geographical position is 38º 45'at the northern end, 37º 23' at the southern end, 0º 41' at the eastern end and 2º 21' at the western end. ===Relief=== The Massif of Revolcadores is the highest point of the Region of Murcia, its peak is the Los Obispos Peak with 2014 m altitude. The region of Murcia is located at the eastern end of the Baetic System, being affected climatologically by an orography that isolates it from the Atlantic influence. These mountain ranges are divided in turn from North to South in: * the Cordillera Prebética: the northernmost, where the Sierra del Carche stands out among others. * the Cordillera Subbética: it consists of numerous dipping faults superimposed on each other or on the materials of the Prebaetic. The Massif of Revolcadores, the highest in the region with 2,015 meters, belongs to this system. * and the Cordillera Penibética: with three lithological complexes distinct from North to South (Nevado-Filabride, Alpujárride and Maláguide). They are very fractured, although there is a predominance of dipping faults and inverse faults between these complexes. Sierra Espuña is one of the fundamental penibaetic mountains. Approximately 27% of the Murcian territory corresponds to mountainous reliefs, 38% to intramountain depressions and corridor valleys, and the remaining 35% to plains and high plateaus. Some of these valleys and plains are the coastal depression of the Campo de Cartagena-Mar Menor, a little further inland is the Valle del Guadalentín (also called the Murcian pre-coastal depression) that travels much of the Murcian geography in the direction of SW-NE, The fertile plains of the Segura that are arranged since that river enters the region (being one of the most famous ones the so-called Valle de Ricote), and other inland valleys formed by tributaries of the Segura like the basin of Mula. Among the high plateaus are the Campo de San Juan and the Altiplano murciano. As an explanation for this complex relief, it is important to highlight the existence of important faults throughout the area, such as the Fault of Alhama de Murcia, the Fault of Bullas-Archena or the Cicatriz Nor-Bética, which, along with the intersection with other minor faults, generate numerous earth movements, such as the 2011 Lorca earthquake. The most widely present types of soil are the calcaric fluvisol, the calcaric regosol and the calcic xerosol. Regosol soils form approximately a quarter of the region surface and calcic horizons (B horizons [third layers of the soil] being formed by calcium carbonate from deposits and 15 cm thick and least, and containing 15% of CaCO3 as minimum besides more features) occur in almost half of the surface. ===Climatology=== The Region of Murcia enjoys a Mediterranean climate of semi- arid type, with mild winters (an average of 11 °C in December and January) and warm summers (where the daily maximum regularly exceeds 40 °C). The average annual temperature is 18 °C. With little precipitation of about 300 to 350 mm per year, the region has between 120 and 150 days in the year where the sky is totally clear. April and October are the months with the most precipitation, there being frequent heavy downpours in a single day. The distance to the sea and the relief causes a thermal difference between the coast and the interior, specially in winter, when the temperature rarely descends below 10 °C on the coast, while in the interior regions the minimum does not usually rise above 6 °C and the precipitation level is higher (up to 600 mm). The city of Murcia holds the record temperature of the 20th century in Spain. It reached 46.1 °C (115 °F) on July 4, 1994. The winter of 2005 was the coldest in a long time, with snow even falling on the Murcian coast. Lands around Moratalla and river Alharabe. ===Hydrography=== Rivers The hydrographic network of the region is made up of the Segura river and its affluents: * Mundo (which is born in Albacete), it is the one that contributes to the Segura with the greatest volume. * Alhárabe and its affluent, the Benamor. * Mula river. * Guadalentín, Sangonera or Reguerón (which is born upper before Lorca). Due to the water supplying incapacity of the Segura river basin, contributions to this river basin are made, originated from the basin of the Tajo river, by means of the Tajo-Segura transvasement. Seas 200pxThe greatest natural lake of Spain can be found in the region: the Mar Menor (Small Sea) lagoon. It is a salt water lagoon, adjacent to the Mediterranean Sea. Its special ecological and natural characteristics make the Mar Menor a unique natural place and the largest saltwater lake in Europe. With a semicircular shape, it is separated from the Mediterranean Sea by a sand strip in length and between 100 and 1200 m wide, known as La Manga del Mar Menor (the Minor Sea's Sandbar). The lagoon has been designated by the United Nations as a Specially Protected Zone of Importance for the Mediterranean. Its coastal perimeter accounts for of coast in which beaches follow one another with crystal clear shallow water (the maximum depth does not exceed 7m). The lake has an area of 170 square kilometers. === Flora and Fauna ===  Flora  There are more than 30 trees species, more than 50 bush especies and more than 130 herbaceous plant species listed in Region of Murcia. Some species have been introduced in any era, but the individuals of these species are part of the landscapes like any other species. Tree species that can be found in Region of Murcia are Aleppo pines, Mediterranean buckthorns, tamarisk trees, field elms. There are some species that have been introduced like the Mediterranean cypress. Some bush species that compose several landscapes in Region of Murcia are esparto grass, a species of the genus European fan palm, Salsola genistoides (close to the opposite-leaved saltworts), rosemary, lentisks, black hawthorns, Neptune grass, shaggy sparrow-wort and Retama sphareocarpa. There are species which have been introduced such as the tree tobacco and Opuntia maxima. In regards to herbaceous plants, some species are slender sowthistles, false sowthistles, mallow bindweeds, wall barleys, fennels, Brachypodium retusum (close to false- bromes), Thymus hyemalis (close to broad-leaved thymes), Asphodelus ayardii (of the same genus as onionweeds). There some introduced species such as the African wood-sorrel and the flax-leaf fleabane.  Fauna  In the region, more than 10 species of land mammals (not considering bats), 19 bat species, more than 80 bird species, 11 species of amphibians, 21 reptile species and 9 species of fishes can be seen. The mammals which inhabit the area are barbary sheeps, European badgers, beech martens, Eurasian otters, red foxes, wild boars, red squirrels, European wildcats, garden dormouses, and Cabreras vole (of the same genus as field voles). In addition, some species of bats are common pipistrelle, Kukhl's pipistrelle, common bent-wing bat, soprano pipistrelle, greater horseshoe bat, meridional serotine (which only inhabits southern Spain, Morocco, Algeria and Tunis), lesser horseshoe bat and European free-tailed bat. In regards to birds, there are some species of raptors such as Bonelli's eagles, golden eagles, peregrine falcons, little owls and Eurasian eagle-owls. There are also waterbirds like yellow-legged gulls, mallards, black-winged slits, little grebes and garganeys. Other bird species are house sparrow, European greenfinch, European robins, common blackbirdsand European turtle doves. Some amphibians that can be found in Region of Murcia are Perez's frog, common parsley frog, European toads and Natterjack toads. Species of reptiles that are present in the region are Montpellier snakes, ladder snakes, horseshoe whip snakes, viperine water snakes, Iberian worm lizards, Spanish pond turtles, Iberian wall lizards, Spanish psammodromus, Tarentola mauritanica, loggerhead sea turtles and Greek tortoises. Fish species that are present in the region are Atlantic horse mackerel, Spanish toohtcarp, gilt-head bream, greater amberjack, sand steenbras and flathead grey mullet. ==History Prehistory and Ancient Era === There has been presence of human beings in Region of Murcia since the Lower Paleolithic. In regards to the Middle Paleolithic, there is a noteworthy paleontological site named Sima de Las Palomas that is located in Torre-Pacheco municipality, in the southeast of the region. Bone remains of Neanderthals have been discovered there. During the Chalcolithic, the region was inhabited by people of the argaric civilization and that civilization endured until the early Bronze Age. A remarkable site is La Bastida, which is placed in Totana municipality, in the southwestern quarter of Region of Murcia. During the Middle and Late Bronze Age the people that were present in the territory were the Iberians and this civilization continued existing until the very early Ancient history, before the Romans took control over large part of the Iberian Peninsula. A noteworthy site of those people is El Cigarralejo, that is composed of an ancient settlement, a necropolis and a shrine and another is Santuario Ibérico de la Luz, that consists in remains of a Iberian shrine, located in Murcia municipality.Roman Theatre, Cartagena.The Carthaginians settled a town in the place of current Cartagena in the year 227 BC and established a permanent trading port on its coast. They named the town Qart-Hadast. For the Carthaginian traders, the mountainous territory was merely the Iberian hinterland of their seacoast empire. In the year 209 BC, the Romans, conquered Qart-Hadast. During the Roman period the territory belonged to the province of Hispania Carthaginensis. Although Carthago Nova was the most important place in Region of Murcia during the Roman era, those people were also present in large part of the territory. In the rest of Campo de Cartagena, there are remains of ancient villas. In the current municipality Mazarrón, they built a salt factory and they settled a little town named Ficaria. Remains of Roman dwellings also occur in Altiplano and Noroeste comarcas (a kind of regions). In the early 5th century, invasions from the Suebi, Alans and Vandals started to take place in the Iberian Peninsula. The first people settled in Gallaecia province, in the northwest of the peninsula; the second people settled in Lusitania and Carthaginensis province and the Alans in Baetica. Romans asked Visigoths for help about recovering control in Iberian Peninsula and they would provide economic and territory goods in return. The Visigoths defeated the Alans and vandals and they escaped to North Africa. Consequently, Visigoths obtained a federated to the Roman Empire kingdom which occupied territory from Gibraltar to Loire River. In 476, the Visigothic kingdom became independent since the Roman Empire had disappeared. Part of the south of the Iberian Peninsula was conquered by the Byzantines along with the emperor Justinian the Great in 555 AD and the province Spania was established there. Part of the current Region of Murcia belonged to the province and therefore to the Eastern Roman or Byzantine Empire. The current comarca Campo Cartagena-Mar Menor (Cartagena, La Unión, Fuente Álamo, Torre-Pacheco, Los Alcázares, San Javier and Santiago de la Ribera), Mazarrón and the current Alto Guadalentín comarca (Lorca, Águilas, Puerto Lumbreras) belonged to that province. === Moorish Middle Ages === In the early 8th century there was a dispute to succeed to the throne among some Visigothic clans. The king Witiza chose his son Agila to be his successor and the nobles of the court chose Roderico for the same issue. The people that were in favour of Agila, planned a conspiracy to overthrow the new king Roderico. They asked muslim troops for help and they would provide the muslims. The Muslims started conquering the Iberian Peninsula in 711. The king Roderico was murdered and the Visigothic kingdom disappeared. Consequently, the moors conquered large part of Iberian Peninsula by leaps and bounds. There was a nucleus of resistance in almost all the current Region of Murcia and the south of Alicante province and it was leaded by Teodomiro. In 713, he signed the Agreement of Tudmir because the resistance could not endure any more. The territory came under Muslim rule but the conquerors granted politic autonomy to it. Under the Moors, who introduced the large-scale irrigation on which Murcian agriculture depends, the province was known as Todmir; it included, according to Idrisi, the 12th century Arab cartographer based in Sicily, the cities of Orihuela, Lorca, Mula and Chinchilla. Ibn Hud as depicted in the Cantigas de Santa Maria A territory centered on the city of Murcia became independent as taifa after the fall of the Umayyad Caliphate of Córdoba in the early 11th century. The taifa included at some points parts of the current day provinces of Albacete and Almería as well. After the 1086 battle of Sagrajas the Almoravid Emirate swallowed up the taifas. As Almoravid rule ultimately retreated, another taifa king, Abu ʿAbd Allāh Muḥammad ibn Saʿd ibn Mardanīš established another taifa around the cities of Murcia, Valencia and Dénia that opposed for a time to the spread of the Almohads, ultimately sucumbing to the latter's advance in the 1170s. Conversely, when the Almohads receded after their defeat at the 1212 Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa, another taifa king based in Murcia, Ibn Hud, rebelled against Almohad rule and briefly controlled most of Al-Andalus. === Christian Middle Ages and modern period === Ferdinand III of Castile received the submission of the Moorish king of Murcia under the terms of the 1243 turning the territory into a protectorate of the Crown of Castile. There were towns that rejected to comply the treaty such as Qartayanna-Al halfa (Cartagena), Lurqa (Lorca) and Mula. There are also towns which governors accepted the treaty, but its inhabitants did not such as Aledo, Ricote, Uruyla (Orihuela) and Medina La-Quant (Alicante), (although the two last ones don't belong to Region of Murcia, they were part of Taifa of Murcia). In 1245, a Castilian army and a fleet that had came from the Cantabrian sea, entered in and conquered Qartayanna. Consequently, the rest of the resistance towns were also taken by the Castilians. Following the adherence of local muslims to the 1264–1266 Mudéjar revolt, Alfonso X of Castile outright annexed the territory in 1266 with critical military support from his uncle Jaime I of Aragon. The Castilian conquest of Murcia was significant because it gave the former access to the Mediterranean for the first time. Conversely it marked the end of the southwards expansion along the Iberian Mediterranean coast of the Crown of Aragon. The kingdom of Murcia was repopulated with people coming from Christian territories by bestowing properties to them. James II of Aragon broke an agreement between Castile and Aragon crowns about the territory for every kingdom and conquered Alicante, Elche, Orihuela, Murcia, Cartagena and Lorca from 1296 to 1302. As a consequence of that conquer, there was an agreement named Sentencia Arbitral de Torrellas in which Ferdinand IV of Castile and James II took part. What was stipulated in the second agreement was the return of territory to the Crown of Castile but the towns Cartagena, Orihuela, Elche and Alicante. In 1305 Cartagena was returned to the Castile. The kingdom of Murcia lost definitely the territory of the current province of Alicante. The Castilian monarchs proceeded to entrust wide competences to a senior officer called the Adelantado Mayor over the whole Kingdom of Murcia (then a borderland of the Crown of Castile, nearing Granada and Aragon). The kingdom of Murcia was divided into religious manors, nobility manors and señoríos de realengo (type of manioralism in which the noble had the property, but the king had the authority to administer justice). There were two noble lineages during the Low Middle Ages and the modern period: Los Manueles and Los Fajardo. The Kingdom of Murcia was adjacent the Emirate of Granada and that fact brought on several wars and Muslim raids, which occurred mainly during the 15th century. Map of the Kingdom of Murcia in 1590 In the early 16th century, the numbers of inhabitants increased in the Kingdom of Murcia. There were three plague epidemic during the century, but they did not affect severely the region. In the first third of that century, the Revolt of the Comuneros occurred. Some places that were supporting the revolt were towns in the current Castile and León and Castilla-La Mancha regions. In the Kingdom of Murcia, the revolutionary towns were Murcia, Cartagena, Lorca, Caravaca, Cehegín and Totana. The castle of Aledo was a spot for defending the Monarchy. In 1521 the Revolt of the Comuneros was defeated. In the early 17th the king Philip III of Spain expelled all the moriscos (descendants of muslims) of the Crown of Castilla and the Crown of Aragon. During this century two plague epidemics also occurred. During the 18th century there was relevant baroque artist in the Kingdom of Murcia whose name is Francisco Salzillo. He made carvings with religious imagery. === 19th and 20th centuries === In 1807, Napoleon signed the Treaty of Fointenebleau with Spain to cross the peninsula in order to conquer Portugal. In the early 1808, Napoleon betrayed Spain and invaded Pamplona, San Sebastián, Barcelona, Burgos and Salamanca. The people from Madrid started an uprising in 1802. The inhabitants of Spain were summoned for fighting against the French invaders. The people of the country established an organisation and groups of administrators were made up – they composed a politic organisation that was an alternative of the official one. The name of that groups was junta and there was one for each province. There were not much presence of French invaders in the Kingdom of Murcia and battles were also rare in the region. Nevertheless, there were soldiers from the territory who battled in other areas of Spain. In addition, the region became an strategy area for the traffic of troops, guns and supplies which destination was the east of the Iberian Peninsula or Andalucía. French troops attacked the Kingdom of Murcia in 1810. Most people who had posts of politic authority escaped. The French side, which came form Lorca, invaded the town Murcia on 23 April, and looted it on 26. The troops came back to the town in August, but the martial resources had been expanded and the French attack was averted. The French army occupied Murcia again in January 1812. It looted Águilas, Lorca, Caravaca, Cehegín, Jumilla, Yecla, Mula, Alhama de Murcia and the territory of Ricote Valley. Cartagena withstood the French siege owing to its rampart and the help of English floats. The French side was definitely defeated in Vitoria (north of Spain) in 1814. In 1936, there was a martial uprising during the Second Spanish Republic era. The North African territories of Spain were taken on 17 July. The uprising was successful in some areas of Spain. The partial success of the uprising brought on the Spanish Civil War. The province of Murcia supported the Frente Popular (governing party in that era). The port of Cartagena became the main base of the Republican sided navy and was home to destroyer, cruise and submarine fleets. Thus, Region of Murcia was a geostrategic spot during the war. There were also anti-aircraft bases through out the region in order to defend Cartagena. The Region of Murcia was in a rear position and situation in regards to the war and overall it didn't receive attacks. The exceptions consisted in aviation attacks, specially to Cartagena and Águilas. However, all the large factories, the basis services and some properties were seized by trade unions and went under their rule. There was a impoverishment among the inhabitants and a lack of meal supplies. Consequently, the rationing was established in the territory. During the Francoist Spain, the wine agriculture and economic activities raised in Altiplano comarca (north of Region of Murcia). An oil refinery structure was established in Cartagena in 1942 and more power refineries, supply refineries and factories were constructed in the same area during the 1950s and 1960s decades. Murcia became an autonomous region in 1982. ==Demography== The Region of Murcia has a population of 1,424,063 inhabitants (INE 2008, National Statistic Institute of Spain), of which almost a third (30.7%) live in the municipality of Murcia.

The Murcian dialect is one of the southern dialects of Spanish and tends to eliminate many syllable-final consonants and to emphasize regional vocabulary, much of which is derived from Aragonese, Catalan and Arabic words. The general intonation and some of the distinctive vocabulary of the Spanish dialect spoken in Murcia share several traits with the one spoken in the neighboring province of Almería, north of Granada, and the Vega Baja del Segura in the Alicante province. The Valencian language is spoken in a small area of the region known as El Carche. == Economy == The Gross domestic product (GDP) of the autonomous community was 31.5 billion euros in 2018, accounting for 2.6% of Spanish economic output.

Aquaculture is also performed and the species that are bred are atlantic blufins tunae, gilt-head breams and sea basses. == Tourism == Despite the famous seaside resorts, the overall region is relatively unknown even within Spain, so it continues to be relatively unspoilt compared to other more overcrowded areas of the Spanish Mediterranean coast. Nevertheless, its more than 300 sunny days a year with an average temperature of 21 degrees Celsius, and the of beaches of the so-called Costa Cálida (Warm Coast) have attracted tourists for decades. The region is also being promoted as a cultural destination with a lot of highlights for visitors: monuments, gastronomy, cultural events, museums, historic remains, festivals etc. The Region of Murcia is one of the Spanish autonomous communities that has grown the most in the last years, and this has conferred it the character of an ideal destination of services, shopping and for the organization of cultural events and conventions. ===Cultural tourism=== Major tourist destinations Murcia Cathedral.The most visited towns are shown below: *Murcia, the capital city, offers the facilities, equipment and services of a large city. It is the seventh largest Spanish city by population with approximately 440,000 inhabitants in 2009. Murcia's sights include a very tall belfry and its famous Cathedral. Murcia is also a large University town with more than 30,000 students per year. It has more than 2 million m2 of parks and gardens. Murcia has a rich history tied to the Jewish community. *Cartagena is the region's second largest city and one of the main Spanish naval bases. Sights include its recently restored Roman Theatre (among its numerous other Roman remains) and a number of modernist buildings made for its military fortifications. *Lorca is a large medieval town at the foothills of which its famous castle stands. It is the second largest municipality of Spain by area. *Caravaca de la Cruz, or simply Caravaca, is one of the five official Holy cities for Catholicism since it is claimed to house part of the Lignum Crucis, the Holy Cross. The castles itinerary Castle of Lorca The interior of the region of Murcia has plenty of castles and fortifications showing the importance of these frontier lands between the Christian Castile and the Muslim Andalusia. They include: *Castle of Jumilla, a former Roman fortification turned by the Moors into an Alcazaba. The Castilian Kings and the marquis of Villena gave it its appearance of Gothic royal residence. *Castle of Moratalla, one of the largest castles of the province, built to defend the town of Moratalla from the invaders from the nearby Muslim Kingdom of Granada. *Castle of Mula, of Muslim origin, but as with many castles, eventually restored and renovated. *Real Alcázar of Caravaca de la Cruz, where the Holy sanctuary was built, also of Moorish origin, conquered by the Christians and finally home of several noble families. *Concepción Castle, in Cartagena, built on one of the five hills of the old Carthagena, following the Roman taste. Now is home of the Centre for the Interpretation of Cartagena's History. *Lorca Castle, also known as the Fortress of the Sun. Festivals The Burial of the Sardine in Murcia Cartagena's and Lorca's Holy Week's processions have been declared of International Tourist Interest, together the Murcia's \\"Bando de la Huerta\\" and \\"The Burial of the Sardine in Murcia\\", included in its Spring Festivities. Murcia's Holy Week is also interesting since its processions include Murcian sculptor Francisco Salzillo's statues. Cartagena's main festivities are the Carthagineses y Romanos, re-enacting the Punic Wars. They have been declared of National Tourist Interest. The Águila's Carnival is one of the most important and colourful of Spain. ===Beaches and Gulf=== La Manga del Mar Menor This is the most developed tourist resource in Murcia. The Costa Cálida has of beaches, from el Mojón at the North near Alicante to Águilas, South West Murcia, near Almería. One of the major destinations of Murcia is the Mar Menor or Small Sea, the largest natural lake of Spain and the largest salty lagoon in Europe, located by the Mediterranean. It is separated from the mediterranean by a narrow sandy strip known as La Manga del Mar Menor or simply La Manga. It is probably the most developed and overcrowded holiday area of Murcia, despite being declared a Specially Protected Area of Mediterranean Importance (SPAMIs) by the United Nations. Mar Menor's muds are famous for its therapeutic properties. Apart from Mar Menor, the Murcian coast from the historical city of Cartagena to the frontier with Andalusia, that corresponds to the Mediterranean Sea alternates wild and unspoilt rocky areas with large sandy beaches, with the towns of Mazarrón and Águilas standing out. The tourism needs have forced the area to add all kinds of facilities and services. The construction boom shows the huge amount of estates, including the controversial holiday resorts of Polaris World and second residences, as well as numerous malls. Thanks to the orography and climate of the region of Murcia, these lands are suitable for golf courses, a fact that has been very controversial because of the need for water, which Murcia lacks, being a very dry region. Other services includes nautical charters; yacht facilities; golf courses; adventure tourism companies; sports federations; tourist routes; guided visits and excursions by sea. ===Natural resources and rural tourism=== The region of Murcia has 19 areas under different statutes of protection, representing 6% of its territory.

Visitors can engage in activities related to excursions, day trips, sports, sightseeing. ==TransportRoad=== The region's highway network provides connectivity along the coast, with three highways links with Andalusia (Autovía A-91, Autovía A-7 and the tolled Autopista AP-7) and another three with the Valencian Community (A-7 and the tolled AP-7 and Autopista AP-37), but only the Autovía A-30 connects Murcia with inland Spain. It is thus the goal of the regional government to provide alternative highway corridors that connect the inland border of Murcia to the coastal zones. All in all, the autonomous government is investing heavily in its highway network, both for trips along the coast and inland-coast connectivity. Due to the expansion of the regional network that this effort is expected to produce, Murcia has recently implemented a new naming scheme for its regional highways, more in accordance with the national network. When the renaming is complete, all highways will be identified by white-on-blue names that start with RM (for Región de Murcia). {  - ! width=\\"150px\\"  Signal !! Type !! Denomination !!

He started playing when he was fifteen at the team Fayt-Manage in Hainaut. He was signed by the youth team of La Louvière, where he quickly gained the attention of many sides. At the age of sixteen, he went to the English team Birmingham City, impressing on trial, but a transfer didn't follow as La Louvière wanted a transfer price which was too high for such a young player. In 2008, El Ghanassy made his debut in the first team of La Louvière. The team had just been relegated to the Third Division and was about to merge with RACS Couillet. El Ghanassy received some playing time, but nevertheless left for Gent not long afterwards. Although he was initially added to the youth team, he played a number of games in the Jupiler Pro League. Thanks to his creativity and drive he was being named as the successor to Bryan Ruiz, who had left in the summer of 2009 for FC Twente. Due to their similarities as players, he was compared to Ruiz by pundits. In his first appearances for Gent, El Ghanassy became known as a fine passer of the ball, and one who provided many assists for his teammates, but rarely scored himself. His first goal was scored in the Belgian League playoffs in 2009/10 against Zulte Waregem. Since that goal he has become more prolific. One of his most important contributions was a goal against the Belarusian team FC Naftan Novopolotsk in the Champions League qualifiers. It was the only goal in that game, which meant that Gent qualified for the third qualifying round. During this period, El Ghanassy was followed by several European top teams, with Manchester City, Milan, Everton, Anderlecht, Sunderland and LyonHet Laatste Nieuws, 6 November 2010, El Ghanassy speelt zich in de kijker van AC Milan being linked with the Belgian. On 25 October 2010, it was revealed scouts from Scottish club Celtic had watched El Ghanassy in action. His agent described him as a \\"magician\\" in an interview with STV, saying he would encourage the player to move to the Glasgow club.Celtic scout Belgian talent El Ghanassy STV Sport, 25 October 2010 On 11 July 2012, West Bromwich Albion confirmed the loan signing of El Ghanassy from Gent. He signed a season-long deal with an option to make the move permanent in West Bromwich Albion's favour.Yassine Determined to Shine www.wba.co.uk, 11 July 2012 He scored his first goal for WBA against Yeovil in the League Cup on 28 August 2012. On 30 January 2013, Dutch side Heerenveen announced that they had signed El Ghanassy on loan for the rest of the season. After turning down a three-year contract with Kairat in the Kazakhstan Premier League during January 2015, El Ghanassy signed a one-year contract with Stabæk on 29 March. On 12 April 2015, he played his first match for the club against Norwegian club Odds. After spells with Oostende and FC Nantes, El Ghanassy was released by the latter in October 2019. In January 2020, he was in talks with Ligue 2 side Stade Malherbe Caen about a contract, but a move never materialized. ==International career== Because of the fact that El Ghanassy has double Belgian-Moroccan nationality, he could choose to play for either country, leading to him playing International youth team games for both nations. El Ghanassy was called up by the national coach Georges Leekens to play in the Belgian national team on 8 October 2010 and to play his first international game. El Ghanassy made his debut for Belgium in a friendly match against Finland, and as a result, would still be eligible to play for Morocco. ==Personal life== On 8 March 2018, El Ghanassy received a six-month prison sentence after appearing in court for a speeding offence for the 15th time. He was given the jail term by a court in Bruges and was banned from driving for two years. This happened after being caught for reckless driving in June 2016. ==Career statistics== {  style=\\"text-align: center\\" + Appearances and goals by club, season and competition - !rowspan=2Club !rowspan=2Season !colspan=3League !colspan=2National Cup !colspan=2League Cup !colspan=2Continental !colspan=2Other !colspan=2Total - !DivisionAppsGoalsAppsGoalsAppsGoalsAppsGoalsAppsGoalsAppsGoals - La Louvière 2007–08  60  colspan=2–colspan=2–colspan=2–60 - rowspan=7KAA Gent 2008–09 rowspan=6Jupiler Pro League 110  colspan=2–colspan=2–colspan=2–110 - 2009–10 26160colspan=2–21102444 - 2010–11 30651colspan=2–10090547 - 2011–12 24442colspan=2–colspan=2–91377 - 2012–13 0000colspan=2–colspan=2–colspan=2–00 - 2013–14 21530colspan=2–colspan=2–colspan=2–245 - !colspan=2Total !112161830012128317023 - West Bromwich Albion (loan) 2012–13 Premier League 001021colspan=2–colspan=2–31 - Heerenveen (loan) 2012–13 Eredivisie 12500colspan=2–colspan=2–20145 - Al Ain (loan) 2013–14 UAE Arabian Gulf League 11100colspan=2–70colspan=2–181 - Stabæk 2015 Tippeligaen 26340colspan=2–colspan=2–colspan=2–303 - rowspan=4Oostende 2015–16 rowspan=3Jupiler Pro League 5100colspan=2–colspan=2–104155 - 2016–17 28450colspan=2–colspan=2–80414 - 2017–18 3000colspan=2–100040 - !colspan=2Total !365500010184609 - rowspan=1Nantes 2017–18 rowspan=1Ligue 1 2001010colspan=2–colspan=2–220 - !colspan=3Career total !223302933120148732342 } ===International=== {   !colspan=3Belgium national team - !YearAppsGoals - 201120 - !Total20 } ==Honours== K.A.A.

He was hardly playing opportunities, and the following season he was loaned to KMSK Deinze. During the 2007–08 season he was loaned to KV Kortrijk. After that season AA Gent wanted to take him back into the first team. Nfor played half a season at Ghent, but could not completely break in first class. Gent decided to loan him out again. KV Kortrijk and Zulte Waregem competed for Nfor services, Zulte Waregem drew the longest straw and hired the striker initially until the end of the season. After Zulte-Waregem Player Mbaye Leye AA Gent departed Nfor was adopted definitively by SV Zulte Waregem. For the 2010-2011 he returned to his former club KV Kortrijk, and signed on May 19, 2011 a contract for three years. He became a regular player during the 2011–2012 season and won the Kortrijk Golden Boot, a prize awarded by the supporters. ===Geox=== Along with fellow Cameroonian footballer Aloys Nong, Nfor is sponsored by Geox, the shoe that breathes. ===Azerbaijan=== In August 2013, Nfor moved to the Azerbaijan Premier League with then reigning champions Neftchi Baku. In the first season they won the Cup. Nfor's 2-year contract with Neftchi Baku ended in August 2015 and he left the club after ending his contract. === Saudi Arabia === Since January 2016 he joined Al-Wehda Mecca of Saudi Arabia. He played 8 matches and scored 3 goals against Alhilal, Ittihad, and Alraed in the Saudi Professional League. ===Back to Belgium=== After five months in Malta, playing for Birkirkara, he moved back to Belgium in January 2018 and joined Dender.

The species are similar to each other, small metallic blue-green-bronze beetles, often distinguished from each other only by the aedeagus. The species of Altica, both as larvae and as adults, are phytophagous, feeding on plant foliage of various food plant taxa, specific for each Altica species. Onagraceae and Rosaceae (mainly Rubus) are the dominant host plant families for Holarctic species.

It was first formulated in the 1976 paper titled \\"Agreeing to Disagree\\" by Robert Aumann, after whom the theorem is named. ==Explanation== Aumann's agreement theorem says that two people acting rationally (in a certain precise sense) and with common knowledge of each other's beliefs cannot agree to disagree. More specifically, if two people are genuine Bayesian rationalists with common priors, and if they each have common knowledge of their individual posterior probabilities, then their posteriors must be equal. This theorem holds even if the people's individual posteriors are based on different observed information about the world. Simply knowing that another agent observed some information and came to their respective conclusion will force each to revise their beliefs, resulting eventually in total agreement on the correct posterior. Thus, two rational Bayesian agents with the same priors and who know each other's posteriors will have to agree. A question arises whether such an agreement can be reached in a reasonable time and, from a mathematical perspective, whether this can be done efficiently. Scott Aaronson has shown that this is indeed the case. Of course, the assumption of common priors is a rather strong one and may not hold in practice. However, Robin Hanson has presented an argument that Bayesians who agree about the processes that gave rise to their priors (e.g., genetic and environmental influences) should, if they adhere to a certain pre-rationality condition, have common priors. Studying the same issue from a different perspective, a research paper by Ziv Hellman considers what happens if priors are not common. The paper presents a way to measure how distant priors are from being common. If this distance is ε then, under common knowledge, disagreement on events is always bounded from above by ε. When ε goes to zero, Aumann's original agreement theorem is recapitulated. In a 2013 paper, Joseph Halpern and Willemien Kets argued that \\"players can agree to disagree in the presence of ambiguity, even if there is a common prior, but that allowing for ambiguity is more restrictive than assuming heterogeneous priors.\\" == References == Category:Bayesian statistics Category:Economics theorems Category:Game theory Category:Probability theorems Category:Rational choice theory Category:Theorems in statistics ","title":"Aumann's agreement theorem"},{"id":"20515601","text":"Club Deportivo Utiel is a football team based in Utiel in the autonomous community of Valencian Community.

It was established following work promoted by the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) and operated with a group of 14 industry shareholders. In November 2015 CEEQUAL was acquired by Building Research Establishment (BRE Global Ltd) following a recommendation from the CEEQUAL Board; this move represents a shared ambition to bring together two successful sustainability rating schemes – BREEAM and CEEQUAL – to create a single, science-based best practice standard and certification tool for civil engineering and other infrastructure projects in the UK and around the world. From November, CEEQUAL will transfer its business operations to BRE Global, and CEEQUAL will, after this transfer, be delivered by the BREEAM certification team with continued support from the CEEQUAL scheme management team. The acquisition has been prompted by the industry’s desire for a single sustainability rating scheme that addresses the challenges that Infrastructure clients, professions and contractors currently face in delivering more sustainable and resilient infrastructure. The new scheme will also address the need for integration with building related schemes so that clients with mixed developments can have a single combined rating for their asset. The new single combined scheme will help to deliver enhanced environmental and social benefits for civil engineering works and better economic outcomes that benefit society. CEEQUAL encourages and promotes the attainment of high economic, environmental and social performance in all forms of civil engineering through identifying and applying best practice. It aims to assist clients, designers and contractors to deliver improved sustainability performance and strategy in a project or contract, during specification, design and construction. The scheme rewards project and contract teams who go beyond the legal, environmental and social minima to achieve distinctive environmental and social performance in their work.CEEQUAL Website - Introduction Retrieved on 2 December 2008 ==History== Prior to the recent acquisition by BRE, CEEQUAL was developed by a team led by the ICE, with government financial support from the DETR and DTI Partners in Innovation schemes, and from the ICE's Research & Development Enabling Fund. The development of CEEQUAL was managed by Crane Environmental Ltd., and received support and participation from relevant government departments and agencies, professional and industry associations, and civil engineering consultants and contractors. Following industry-wide consultation and trialling, the scheme was launched in September 2003 and the first eight Awards presented at the ICE. Since then, CEEQUAL has become the UK industry scheme for assessing environmental and sustainability performance in civil engineering and public realm projects, and is now widely used by major civil engineering clients, designers and contractors. In June 2008 CEEQUAL was recognised by HM Government's report, Strategy for Sustainable Construction as an initiative helping to 'drive forward' the Government’s design agenda for civil engineering and infrastructure projects.ICE News Website - CEEQUAL gets government backing in new construction strategy Retrieved on 2 December 2008 The total construction value of all projects assessed or in process of being assessed under CEEQUAL reached the £6 billion mark in autumn 2008. By 2015 the civil engineering value of work that has been or is currently being assessed exceeds £25 billion.Press Release - Value of projects assessed under CEEQUAL is approaching £6bn Retrieved on 2 December 2008 ==How CEEQUAL works== The scheme uses a points-scoring-based assessment, which is applicable to any civil engineering or public realm project. The scheme is made up of 200 questions within the CEEQUAL Manual relating to environmental and social aspects of a project such as the use of water, energy and land, impacts on ecology, landscape, neighbours, archaeology, as well as waste minimisation and management, and community relations and amenity. Awards are made to projects in which the clients, designers and constructors have gone beyond the legal and environmental minima, to achieve distinctive environmental standards of performance. Project assessments are self-assessments carried out by an Assessor from within any part of a project team, or contracted in, who must have been trained by CEEQUAL. CEEQUAL also appoints a trained Verifier to the project, who is independent of the project team and acts to support the Assessor and provide validation of the completed assessment and subsequent Award. The first step involves the Assessor and Verifier agreeing which questions are not relevant to the project and should be scoped out. The project is then assessed against the remaining question set. The Assessor completes the assessment by gathering the appropriate supporting evidence and completing a Scoring Spreadsheet. This is then submitted to the Verifier, together with the supporting evidence, for review and approval. Once the Verifier is satisfied with the assessment, the Scoring Spreadsheet is submitted to CEEQUAL for ratification, and a CEEQUAL Award certificate is issued.AggRegain Website - CEEQUAL Step by Step Guide Retrieved on 2 December 2008 There are several different CEEQUAL Award levels that a project can achieve, depending on the percentage number of points scored against the scoped-out question set. These are: * more than 25% - Pass * more than 40% - Good * more than 60% - Very Good * more than 75% - Excellent ==Award types== Five types of award can be applied for: * Whole Project Award, which is normally applied for jointly by or on behalf of the client, designer and principal contractor(s) * Client & Design Award * Design Only Award, applied for by the principal designer(s) only * Construction Only Award, applied for by the principal contractor(s) only * Design & Build Award, applied for the designer(s) and constructor(s) of a project. For larger or long-term projects an Interim (Client & Outline Design) Award is assessed en route to a final Whole Project Award. ==The manual== The CEEQUAL Assessment Manual for Projects contains the 200 questions that comprise the CEEQUAL scheme and against which projects are assessed.

He has appeared regularly throughout his career on radio stations Rinse, Kiss 100 and BBC Radio 1. He also currently runs the record labels Adamantium Music, Earth616 and KeepinItGrimy through which he has released projects for artists and producers across vinyl and digital formats. He also founded KeepinItGrimy, a brand entirely focused on Grime activity. He is very active in the local community and is always willing to dispense sound advice to both up-and-coming MCs and DJs alike. ==Personal life== Outside of music, Logan is most known for his love of trainers/sneakers. Focusing predominantly on Nike Air Max models, his collection is very large and he is an active member in the Sneaker Culture community. He was once personally gifted a pair of Off White Nike Air Max 90s by Virgil Abloh. Logan has collaborated with Nike many times in the past including a Grime mixtape curated to celebrate the launch of Niketown London's NikeID suite, as well as DJing numerous Air Max Day and product activation events. Logan performed at Skepta's SK Air launch event in 2018 and the Nike TN3 launch in 2019. Logan enjoys video games, in particular the Street Fighter series. He has become a prominent member of the competitive community and regularly commentates competitive Street Fighter events across the world, often working with Femi “F-Word” Adeboye. He hosts a weekly show for Capcom UK on their Twitch and YouTube channel. He has been a commentator for some of the most prestigious events such as Capcom Cup Finals held in San Francisco, California, Red Bull Kumite and EVO. He is currently part of the semi-regular Gfinity Elite Series show as a commentator for their Street Fighter V broadcasts. Logan also organises events for the Street Fighter community under the WinnerStaysOn brand. These have been held at the Red Bull Gaming Sphere and Capcom UK's London office. ==Career== Logan embarked on his radio career on local Essex pirate station Plush FM hosting several cover shows playing underground garage in 2002. Towards the end of 2002 he was recruited to London then-pirate station Rinse FM where his show became a popular place to hear the newest music and regularly featured the biggest MCs performing live. His last Rinse show was captured on video and featured Wiley, Skepta, Trim, Ruff Sqwad, Tinchy Stryder, Newham Generals and many others. He moved to London's Kiss 100 in the spring of 2005 and began a late night specialist Grime show running from 2am to 4am on Thursday night/Friday morning. The popularity of this show soon saw it move to Monday night 11pm1am where it became the leading show amongst young people within London at that time, capturing over 61,000 listeners in the Greater London area as certified by RAJAR. His exposure of live mix sets and first played new tracks has led to him becoming the leading figure in radio for Grime music. His shows are now also captured on video and streamed as YouTube clips which have proved very popular. The show broadcast at 1am on Monday and has become very popular on social networking site Twitter using the hashtag #KissGrime which has trended nationally with great frequency. New additions to the show the 'Versus Sessions' where an artist picks their favourite current beat and performs live as well as the 'After Hours' classic Grime sets are also made available via his YouTube channel 'KeepinItGrimy' founded in 2008. Logan won multiple 'Grime Awards', public voted awards that were given to the best grime acts in different categories by GrimeForum. He currently holds the record for most awards won by a single act with 7 separate wins. Logan left Kiss FM in 2014, along with DJ EZ and Hannah Wants following changes that saw many specialist DJs moved to the digital only KissFresh channel, and immediately took up a residency on the new SixtyMinutes rotating, regular guest mix feature on MistaJam's BBC Radio 1xtra show. From November 2015 he re-joined BBC Radio 1Xtra covering for Sian Anderson (till February 2016) on Tuesdays 10pm, covering the best of Grime. In 2016 he was brought on to the BBC Radio 1 Residency line up. After being announced as taking up a new regular weekly show on Friday nights on 1xtra, on 7 November the BBC released a statement that Logan would no longer be hosting the show. A statement from Logan referenced a number of publicly visible tweets made between 2011 and 2015 that perpetuated negative stereotypes offensive to women, specifically of mixed black heritage, that were brought to the attention of the BBC who made the decision he would be unsuitable to join the network. Subsequently, he also left the Radio 1 Residency position. In January 2018, Logan joined Rinse FM once again as part of their new The Grime Show residency alongside DJs; Spooky, GrandMixxer and AG. The once a month rotating residency replaced Spyro's show who had been brought in to 1xtra to cover the show vacated by Logan. In April 2019, The Grime Show was dissolved and Logan will begin a regular solo show later this year. Logan began recording a regular video podcast under his KeepinItGrimy brand in February. The weekly podcast was published on YouTube and followed on audio only platforms. It takes the form of casual conversation with his associates within the Grime scene. Logan also maintains the KeepinItGrimy playlist on Spotify, where he aggregates new Grime releases as a resource for fans. Logan has released several mixtapes on the scene including The War Report, a collection of War Dubs from some popular Grime artists such as Wiley, Scorcher, Ghetts and Devlin and Oneaway Style, a free mixtape in association with NikeiD. He often releases free downloads for his fans, most recently in the form of a series of grime mixes named The Best There Is At What I Do and classic garage mixed ‘Tuned in to 99’ to celebrate the relaunch of Nike's Tuned Air Max shoe. He also mixed live Tropical 2.0, released through Boy Better Know records. On 29 June 2019 he did commentary for All Elite Wrestling (AEW) during the Fyter Fest pre-show. ==DiscographyDJ Mixes=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\"  Title ! scope=\\"col\\"  Details - ! scope=\\"row\\" FabricLive.83  * Released: 25 September 2015 * Label: Fabric * Formats: CD, vinyl, digital download - } == References  External links == *Logan Sama official website. *Logan Sama on Twitter.

In the speech, Lysias accuses Eratosthenes, a member of the Thirty Tyrants who ruled Athens following the Peloponnesian War, of the murder of his brother, Polemarchus (around 403 BCE). ==Overview== Lysias's career as a speech writer, or logographer, was interrupted by the occupation of the Thirty Tyrants, an oligarchic junta placed in power by the Spartans following their victory against Athens in the Peloponnesian War, which ended in 404 BCE. Lysias, along with a small group of fellow metics, including his brother, Polemarchus, were arrested by the pro-Spartan regime on charges of general hostility and resistance to the Thirty Tyrants. According to Lysias, the group was arrested on trumped up charges just so the Thirty Tyrants could have a reason to confiscate their substantial wealth and property. The subsequent execution of Polemarchus is one of the subjects of the speech. Eratosthenes was a member of the Thirty Tyrants who oversaw the arrest of Lysias, Polemarchus, and their fellow metics. The speech was written following the collapse of the oligarchy and the restoration of democracy in Athens in 403 BCE. ==Lysias's speech== Lysias is both the author and the speaker in the speech, which is considered to be among the most famous of his works. Upon the restoration of democracy in Athens, a general amnesty was granted to protect the former members of the oligarchy. This amnesty meant that the officials of the oligarchic government were protected from prosecution from acts they committed before the democratic government was restored except in cases where they personally committed a murder. The members of the Thirty Tyrants were not granted amnesty until they successfully defended themselves at their euthunai, a process in which government officials account for their actions that took place during their terms. It is unclear whether this speech was delivered at Eratosthenes's euthunai, at a separate homicide trial, or at all.Some notes on this in Todd's translation, p. 113-116. Regardless of when or in what form the speech took place, Lysias's argument consists of two distinct sections: a general attack on Eratosthenes and the other members of the Thirty Tyrants pointing out their collective corruption before and after the pro-Spartan regime was installed and a cross-examination of Eratosthenes himself. During his cross-examination, Eratosthenes makes a very similar argument that the Nazi defendants made at the Nuremberg Trials. Eratosthenes maintained that he was simply following the orders of his superiors and that he personally did not command much authority. ==Uncertain outcome== Unfortunately, no evidence exists for the outcome of the trial, or, again, for whether the speech was ever actually delivered. As a non-citizen, Lysias would not have been able to deliver the speech himself in court. Some scholars believe that Lysias wrote the speech hypothetically and circulated it in a pamphlet just to voice his opinions on the matter. It is also suggested, however, that Lysias was granted citizenship by the democracy for a period after the 30 were expelled, in which case he could have delivered his own speech in the court.This is disputed, though; although Thrasyboulus certainly proposed citizenship for Lysias, the decree was quickly annulled, and \\"it is quite likely that Lysias never enjoyed the citizenship\\" (Todd, p. 5) == Notes  Bibliography == * Lysias, trans.

A right-handed batsman and fast underarm bowler who played for Hampshire and Sussex, he made 51 known appearances in first-class matches. He represented the Players in the Gentlemen v Players series. Brown was credited with 89 wickets in his career (i.e., bowled only) with a best return of six in one innings. He had a reputation for extreme pace and was widely known as \\"Brown of Brighton\\". He is said, though the story may be apocryphal, to have once killed a dog when a ball he had bowled went past the stumps and through a coat held by the longstop, hitting the dog which was behind the coat.Altham, p. 57. Another of his longstops, a man called Dench, insisted on fielding with a sack of straw tied to his chest for protection.Frith, p.28. E H Budd played against both Brown and Walter Marcon, who had a similar reputation, and Budd said that \\"Brown was not more terrific in his speed than Marcon\\", an elaborate way of saying that they were both extremely fast.Frith, p.41. Brown was a useful batsman and made 1053 runs at 11.44 with a top score of 70 which he scored during the first of the three roundarm trial matches. He died in Winchester, Hampshire. ==References== Category:1783 births Category:1857 deaths Category:English cricketers Category:English cricketers of 1787 to 1825 Category:English cricketers of 1826 to 1863 Category:Players cricketers Category:Hampshire cricketers Category:Sussex cricketers Category:People from Chichester District Category:Left-Handed v Right-Handed cricketers Category:The Bs cricketers Category:Non-international England cricketers ","title":"George Brown (cricketer, born 1783)"}]`),F={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:P}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},R={class:"card-container"};function E(s,a,o,c,u,i){const m=f("PoemCard");return t(),n(h,null,[a[1]||(a[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Life Quotes🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",R,[(t(!0),n(h,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(r,g)=>(t(),b(m,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:a[0]||(a[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):w("",!0)])],64)}const I=d(F,[["render",E]]),H=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/37.md","filePath":"people/37.md"}'),L={name:"people/37.md"},D=Object.assign(L,{setup(s){return(a,o)=>(t(),n("div",null,[v(I)]))}});export{H as __pageData,D as default};
