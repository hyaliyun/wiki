The sculpture was installed outside the building of Bombay Stock Exchange on 11 January 2008. The bull is inspired by Arturo Di Modica's Charging Bull sculpture that was installed on Wall Street outside the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in 1989. It is tall, long and weighs a tonne (). It was relocated to the Gujarat International Finance Tec-City (GIFT City) near Ahmedabad in 2017. == Design == Rampure was approached by officials of the BSE in 2007 to design the sculpture. He was given photographs of the original sculpture in New York City and studied live bulls to understand their anatomy. A clay model was first designed for the BSE's approval following which the bronze version was made. It was made in four parts owing to its size and took Rampure three months to design and build. While he was allowed to make a few changes to the design, the original pose of the bull was retained owing to the animal's identity in stock markets as a symbol of money. The BSE later commissioned him to create a thousand miniature replicas made of fibre to be given as souvenirs to visiting foreign dignitaries. == Controversy == The sculpture came into news after the stock market crash of 21–22 January 2008 when the Sensex fell from 20,000 to 8,000 resulting in a loss of over a week. It was subsequently considered as a panauti or bad omen. Several brokers demanded the removal of the sculpture following the crash, with an astrologer suggesting that it be re-installed at a more auspicious time. A group of 200 to 300 brokers protested outside the exchange for a day asking for it to be removed. In 2017, prior to its relocation to GIFT City, the BSE decided to allow visitors to photograph the bull. However, due to security issues, it was replaced by an acrylic replica on rollers outside the exchange. The Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) objected to this, claiming that it was inconveniencing people on the road and asked for it to be removed. == References == Category:Cattle in art Category:Fictional bulls Category:2008 sculptures Category:Bronze sculptures in India Category:2008 establishments in India Category:Bombay Stock Exchange ","title":"Big Bull, India"},{"id":"61297457","text":"Roger Hegi (born 28 February 1956) is a retired Swiss football midfielder and later manager.Weltfussball ==References== Category:1956 births Category:Living people Category:Swiss footballers Category:FC Aarau players Category:FC Luzern players Category:FC St. Gallen players Category:Association football midfielders Category:Swiss Super League players Category:Swiss football managers Category:FC St. Gallen managers Category:Grasshopper Club Zürich managers ","title":"Roger Hegi"},{"id":"61297465","text":"Fox Movies is a television network, launched by the Fox Networks Group, which airs across several countries in Europe.

He pursued a philosophy of social mechanism as an administrator for the Ministry of Finance. He is the father of poet Milan Rakic. ==Background== Rakić was born on the 15 of October (Old Style) or 27 October (Gregorian Calendar) 1846 into a prominent military family in Mionica. Literature and culture were abiding passions in the family. He studied at the Grandes écoles in Belgrade and later went abroad to pursue further studies in economics in Munich, Zurich, Göttingen, and London. Upon his return to Serbia he was one of the founders of the political magazine Videlo which became quite influential.Љиљана Урошевић: Потомци кнеза Раке Тешића, pp. 149-150, у часопису „Гласник“, број 36, Историјски архив Ваљево, 2002. године. == Career and publications == Rakić became the administrator of the ministry of finance but was fired in June 1880 after a disagreement with Vladimir Jovanovic. This incident became controversial after Videlo responded by publishing Rakić's account of the dismissal and the reprinting of Jovanovic liberal articles during the 1860s. He translated the works of major foreign writers, like Victor Hugo's \\"Les Miserables\\"; Michal Czajkowski's \\"Cossack Tales'; John William Draper's \\"History of the Intellectual Development of Europe\\"; and works by Ludwig Feuerbach. From 1868 to 1876 he edited Škola (School), a tri- monthly scholastic journal. He was a voluminous writer on educational subjects and was the author of various school-textbooks. He authored 100 books, including several novels, and published hundreds of studies, papers, monographs, and learned articles. Among his pedagogical textbooks were: Schools in Serbia (1868); A Study Guide (1869); Pedagogical Studies (1870); School Hygiene (1870); History of Pedagogy (1871); School Discipline (1871); Adolph Diesterweg (1871); Schools for the Rights of Citizens and Responsibilities (1873). The Byzantine imperial city on the slopes of the Radan mountain in the municipality of Lebane was discovered because of Rakić's writings. In 1881 he received the Order of the Takovo Cross and other equally prestigious awards. == References == Category:Finance ministers of Serbia Category:People from Mionica Category:Serbian writers Category:Serbian politicians Category:Serbian translators Category:Serbian philosophers Category:Serbian diplomats Category:Serbian economists Category:1846 births Category:1890 deaths ","title":"Mita Rakić"},{"id":"61297613","text":"La usurpadora (English: The Usurper) is a Mexican television series produced by Carmen Armendáriz for Televisa. It is a reboot based on the 1998 Mexican telenovela of the same name and the first series of the anthology series \\"Fábrica de sueños\\". In the series, the character Paola Miranda, the First Lady of Mexico, discovers she has a twin sister and tries to swap lives with her. The show began filming on 25 April 2019, with the first five episodes given a special pre-release online on 30 August 2019. The series then ran from 2 September to 4 October 2019, on Las Estrellas. The first and only season consisted of 25 episodes. == Plot == Paola Miranda, the First Lady of Mexico, is in an unhappy marriage to Carlos, the President. At the outset of the show, she discovers that she is adopted and has a twin sister; though she resents the twin she believes made their mother disown her, Paola sees an opportunity to escape her life, and seeks her out. Paola plots to pull a Prince and the Pauper switch with her newfound twin, Paulina Doria, to stand in as First Lady on Independence Day, and then kill her. With her identity (and the twin she despises) dead, Paola could run away with her lover Gonzalo. Paulina is based in the capital of Colombia, Bogotá, running an orphanage and tending to her aging mother, Olga. She is mysteriously offered large donations from a Mexican benefactor to trick her into traveling there. She is kidnapped by Paola, who threatens to murder Olga to blackmail Paulina into assuming her identity for two weeks. Paulina accepts the role and becomes the \\"usurpadora\\", moving into Los Pinos, the presidential palace. During the Independence celebrations, Paulina is shot. However, not only does she live, but the National Intelligence Center opens an investigation into the shooting, thinking that the President was the real target. The President himself also hires a private detective, the former agent Facundo Nava, to investigate. Paola has already run away with Gonzalo to Bora Bora; she is still not satisfied and kills him there, returning to Mexico City to cover her tracks. Meanwhile, Paulina takes to her new role, finding her new public standing the perfect opportunity to engage in social activism. Paola is unimpressed with the total usurpation of her life by the twin she hates, and tries to kill her again using a friend of Gonzalo's, Manuel, who has professed he would kill for her. Facundo is almost hit in the attempt, and begins working directly with Paulina to find the new attacker. Paulina returns to Colombia to make sure that her mother is still alive, trusting Facundo to find out everything. Paola tries to return to her role and, since the two weeks are over, asks for Paulina to give up the life she has grown to love. Paulina is not willing to sacrifice her position of social influence for charity and begins her own scheme: acting crazy to get committed, and using the real story to receive a diagnosis of multiple personality disorder. Paola tries once more to kill her, but instead is mistakenly attacked by Manuel's sister, Teresa, who was supposed to be helping her. Facundo breaks Paulina out of the hospital and takes her to the countryside; Paola is taken to Colombia after being misidentified as her sister after the attack, with her confusion ruled as post-traumatic stress. Olga realizes who Paola really is at the same time that Paulina is returned to Los Pinos by Facundo saying she is cured. Paulina convinces Carlos that she isn't crazy and has him travel to Colombia with her to meet Olga. Paola, Paulina, and Olga come to an agreement whereby the twins will continue swapping lives for a little longer, so that Olga has some time to get to know Paola. Only a few days later, though, she dies, with Paola determinedly returning to Mexico. == Cast and characters == México perdió a la primera dama\\": (L–R) Lisette Bernal (Macarena Oz), Paola Miranda de Bernal (Sandra Echeverría), Carlos Bernal (Andrés Palacios), and Emilio Bernal (Germán Bracco) Part of the cast was revealed by the Las Estrellas website on 25 April 2019. The episodes of the show do not feature a title sequence; subsequently, in each episode the entire cast minus stars Sandra Echeverría and Arap Bethke are credited. In episode one, Echeverría and Bethke are also credited. The three main actors are Echeverría, who plays both Paola Miranda de Bernal, the First Lady, and her twin sister Paulina Doria; Bethke, who plays the former police commander Facundo Nava; and Andrés Palacios, who plays Carlos Bernal, the President of Mexico. Announced later, the secondary cast features several of the relatives of the main characters: Daniela Schmidt plays Gema Vidal, the assistant and lover of Bernal; Juan Carlos Barreto plays Manuel Hernández, who is in love with Paola, with Aurora Gil as Manuel's crazy sister, Teresa. Queta Lavat was added as Piedad Mejía, Bernal's mother. The remaining cast were revealed when the show went to air: * Ana Bertha Espín as Arcadia Rivas de Miranda, Paola's adopted mother * Macarena Oz as Lisette Bernal, Carlos and Paola's daughter * Germán Bracco as Emilio Bernal, Carlos' son * Verónica Terán as Juana, the housekeeper of the presidential house * Montserrat Marañón as Monse, Paulina's nurse and assistant * Josh Gutiérrez as Molina, the de facto head of security at the presidential house * Victoria Hernández as Olga Doria, the biological mother of Paulina and Paola * Lion Bagnis as Diego, Lisette's boyfriend * Paco Rueda as Pedro, Facundo's assistant * Emilio Guerrero as Pascual, the official head of the First Family's security * Ricardo Leguizamo as Wilson, Paulina's ex-boyfriend in Colombia * Emiro Balocco as Dr. Restrepo, the doctor who was hired on Paola's behalf to kill her mother * Gabriela Zamora as Irene, Facundo's lover * Pierre Louis as Osvaldo, Pedro's boyfriend * Juan Martín Jáuregui as Gonzalo Santamaría, Paola's lover == Production  Development === The series was inspired by a story from Cuban telewriter Inés Rodena and largely based on the 1998 version, La usurpadora. Claimed as a major difference compared to the 1998 show, the producers insisted on using the modern American format of 25 episodes that are produced in one block; despite this oddity in terms of Mexican productions, Carmen Armendáriz said the series \\"would not lose its telenovela essence\\". The creative team also wanted to update the story's context, too, changing the businessman and trophy wife leads to the President and First Lady; including settings in other countries (primarily Colombia) to show an international Mexico; and changing the two sons of the leads in the original into a son and daughter, who are also step-siblings. === Casting === On 9 April 2019, People en Español magazine confirmed that Sandra Echeverría would be the new protagonist of the remake. Echeverría said that to play Paulina she took a workshop where she learnt how to speak in a Colombian accent; a reviewer found that the accent improved through the show. Carolina Cano was hired shortly after Echeverría to act as the stand-in for the twins in scenes where they are both present; these scenes were described as Echeverría to be the hardest, not because she had to film them twice, but because any movement in the scene had to be recreated perfectly by both her and Cano. In scenes where both twins' faces can be seen, the production used motion capture. The director of photography, Abraham Reyes Pérez, said that not only does Cano looks very similar to Echeverría, but she also acts in a similar way and quickly learnt the processes of character doubling. === Filming === Bora Bora beach was recreated in Playa del Carmen. A lot of the story takes place in the presidential palace, Los Pinos. Ernesto Esteva, in the art department of the production, said that the house was based on European styles, and more specifically on \\"what was brought from the old continent to New Spain\\". It was built on a sound stage at Televisa, because there were no locations in Mexico City that matched the image the production was trying to achieve. However, Esteva says that there were old buildings in other regions, including Puebla, Tlaxcala and Hidalgo, on which certain parts of the building were based. The palace in the series is not modeled on the real Los Pinos in terms of design and architecture, but Esteva says that the scope of the buildings are similar, so that the events of the show could realistically be happening within the appropriate spaces. The network says that 30 people worked around the clock, and built the functioning palace set in five weeks at a cost of 8.5 million pesos, 4 million of which went on creating the facade. The early scenes in Bora Bora was filmed at the Playa del Carmen in Cancún, with the production only sending a small crew and the two relevant actors, Echeverría and Jáuregui. Shooting also took place on the Riviera Maya, featuring the presidential suite of the Mayakoba Hotel. == Reception  Critical response === Former President Enrique Peña Nieto, and former first lady Angélica Rivera, during the Cry of Dolores in 2018. The moment is fictionally recreated in the series to start the plot. The website La hora de la Novela gave a positive review of the first episodes, commending the special effects and choice of locations. However, the \\"visual look\\" of the show was criticized, with the reviewer suggesting that the production has made the show \\"cold in blue and gray tones\\" to make it look serious, and that this is especially jarring with the scenes set in Bora Bora, where one would expect warm and striking tones to show the tropical destination. The ending theme, a ballad, was also described as not fitting the tone of the show. Overall, the website wrote that the first week of the remake left a \\"good taste in the mouth\\", saying that it had a high production quality; lighting that got better with each episode; good structure and non-invasive music; and producers and writers that are talented at adaptation, keeping the story intact but also modernizing it well. Giving a negative review, Álvaro Cueva of Milenio said that though the production tried to make the show into a series, it was still very much a telenovela, and noted that it came to Mexican television at a bad time, relating it to the first report on the Andrés Manuel López Obrador presidency. Cueva said that the show was too morbid and that its creators must have \\"serious mental issues\\"; he also criticized that the first episode details a plot to assassinate the First Lady during Independence Day, and so could be giving ideas to radicals who would really try such a thing. Unlike La hora de la Novela's warm view of the production's recreation of the show, Cueva referred to it derogatorily as \\"refrito\\", saying it was a mockery to the Mexican audience; he explained that the original was a focused show that knew its audience, and opined that the new production lacked this, saying that the writers haven't even modernized it because they were off-the-mark with what a modern woman in Mexico wants, which is not, in Cueva's view, something as simple as being First Lady. Abraham Reyes of the La Neta Noticias website commented that the production never managed to obtain the same rating level that episode 1 had during its broadcast. According to Reyes, the final episode of the series was described as \\"bland, flat and boring\\", since it offered nothing new with respect to its previous version. Since its end on 4 October 2019, several followers of the production claimed to prefer the 1998 version, than the 2019 version. For its part, with respect to the end of the series, the website La Hora de la Novela gave positive reviews, praising Carmen Armendáriz's production as one of the best in 2019. But she also criticized the abrupt end that was given to the series with Andrés Palacios and Sandra Echeverría staying together as a family, and leaving Betke out. In addition to giving good reviews regarding the protagonists, the work of the actors Juan Carlos Barreto, Aurora Gil, Ana Bertha Espín, Queta Lavat and Paco Ruedas was also praised. === Popular response === The Venezuelan actress Gabriela Spanic, who starred in the 1998 version, lauded the series, commending the quality and praising Echeverría, saying that she loves it and that Echeverría is \\"an excellent actress of the new generation. I really like her work [...] she is doing great. I am very happy that I can say I love the success this is having\\". == Other versions == Rodena's 1998 telenovela, the basis for the show, was itself based on Daphne du Maurier's 1957 The Scapegoat, and took inspiration from several previous Latin American versions, particularly a 1971 Venezuelan telenovela of the story. In 1981, Valentín Pimstein made the first Mexican version of Rodena's novel, called El hogar que yo robé, with Venezuela creating another version, called La intrusa, in 1986. Though the 1998 version was the most popular during its run and is said to be not only the best version, but one of the most popular of all telenovelas, another remake had been made in 2012, ¿Quién eres tú? co-produced by Mexico with Colombia and the United States. == Analysis == The character of Carlos Bernal, the President of Mexico played by Andrés Palacios, has been compared by La Hora de la Novela to have similarities with figures like the Nuevo León governor Jaime Rodríguez Calderón and former president Enrique Peña Nieto, who also, like Bernal, had children out of wedlock. == Episodes == The title of each episode refers to a phrase mentioned by a character in it. ;Notes == Ratings  Mexico ratings = U.S. ratings = Awards and nominations == { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\"  Year ! scope=\\"col\\"  Award ! scope=\\"col\\"  Category ! scope=\\"col\\"  Nominated ! scope=\\"col\\"  Result -  rowspan=\\"11\\" 2020  rowspan=\\"11\\" TVyNovelas Awards  Best Telenovela of the Year  Carmen Armendáriz  -  Best Actress  Sandra Echeverría  -  Best Actor  Andrés Palacios  -  Best Antagonist Actress  Sandra Echeverría  -  Best Leading Actress  Queta Lavat  -  Best Leading Actor  Juan Carlos Barreto  -  Best Co-lead Actress  Ana Bertha Espín  -  Best Co-lead Actor  Arap Bethke  -  Best Direction  Francisco Franco Alba  -  Best Direction of the Cameras  Vivián Sánchez Ross  -  Best Original Story or Adaptation  Larissa Andrade, Tania Tinajero, Zaria Abreu and Fernando Abrego  - } == References External links== * Category:2019 Mexican television series debuts Category:Mexican drama television series Category:Television series by Televisa Category:Spanish-language television shows Category:Mexican LGBT-related television shows Category:Television shows set in Mexico City Category:Television shows set in Bogotá Category:Cultural depictions of women Category:Television series about dysfunctional families Category:2019 Mexican television series endings Category:Gay-related television shows Category:Serial drama television series Category:Television series reboots Category:Mass media portrayals of the upper class Category:2010s LGBT-related drama television series ","title":"La usurpadora (2019 TV series)"},{"id":"61297616","text":"KQHE (92.7 FM) is a radio station licensed to serve the community of Fairbanks, Alaska.

The building was originally built around 1490. ==History== The building was bought by John Cobbold in 1845. He renovated the building, selling the old fixtures – such as linenfold panelling, an internal canopy, and carved beams – to William Burrell, a Glaswegian antique collector, who added them to the Burrell Collection, where they are to this day. In 1947 the building was bought by George Bodley Scott, the managing director of W. S. Cowell Ltd.. He commissioned the Royal Archaeological Institute to conduct a survey to establish the history of the building. This was conducted in 1951 and extracts appeared in a booklet published by Scott in 1970 entitled The Old Neptune Inn.

Founded following the 2008 economic crisis, the company derived its name from anthropologist’s Emile Durkheim’s term “collective effervescence” to describe the larger-than-the-sum-of-its- parts feeling to large group assemblies, such as concerts or sporting events. ==History== Effervescent Collective was founded by Lily Kind while at Goucher College, just as an influx of artists settled in Baltimore in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. Effervescent produced over a dozen full-length productions between 2008 and 2014 and curated different forms of local showcases that featured other emergent dance creators in the city. These productions and events helped expand Baltimore’s dance and physical theater scene by producing the work of many emerging artists and insisting on the presence of experimental dance in the city's blossoming arts community. Effervescent was known for activating unconventional and unused spaces for dance, as well as supporting dancers who found they did not fit into conventions of the concert dance world. During Effervescent's existence, Kind oversaw the majority of productions, which were created with and danced by a changing set of members over the group’s seven year existence. Members often also popped up in impromptu installation-style performances at local festivals Artscape and High Zero. Members also appeared in music videos of local musicians Dungeonesse, Dan Deacon and Bosley. Members of Effervescent performed and developed many of the dancing roles for the Baltimore Rock Opera Society. Effervescent was known for its use of non-traditional spaces, partly out of economic necessity, and partly out of an interest in creating immersive experience for the audience. Effervescent created performances unique to Area 405, Patapsco State Park, Baltimore Skate Park, 2640 Space, Sanctuary Bodyworks, the former The Coward Shoe, the former Maryland Art Place, and Now Child Sound Stage. Individual members also collaborated with rising local theaters such as Annex Theater and Single Carrot Theater. Effervescent was under the fiscal sponsorship of Fractured Atlas, and sustained itself through member contributions and the profits from prolific performance schedule. After Kind’s departure from Baltimore in 2014, Effervescent disbanded. Some members who remained in Baltimore have since established Baltimore Independent Dance Theater, a dance presenting and curating organization. Former member Britta Grant moved to Los Angeles in 2014 and has found success in the commercial dance industry.. Claire Cote now works out of Berlin as multi-media performer Zaftik. Lynne Price was the 2017 Artist in Residence at UMBC, her graduate alma mater. ==Accolades== Effervescent was frequently named \\"Best Dance Company\\" by some of the city's major news outlets, including The Baltimore Sun and Baltimore Magazine. Baltimore City Paper awarded Effervescent the title for three consecutive years. ==Performers and members== The first wave of members were recent graduates of social sciences programs at Goucher College including Peace Studies, Anthropology, Education, Philosophy, Psychology, and Religion. Long standing members included: Britta Grant, Erin Reid, Lynne Price, Jenny B.N., Clarissa Gregory, Pilar Diaz, Christine Striver, Emile Sorger, Peter Redgrave, Marlys Yvonne, Laura Grossman, Melissa Talleda, Marilyn Mullens, Sierra DeSalvia, and Claire Cote - many of whom have since developed professions in the fields of dance, visual art, wellness, health, or social justice. ==WorksProductions=== * Dirty Dancing, 2010 (Directed by Claire Cote and Lily Kind) * Powermoves Forever, 2011 (Directed by Claire Cote) * Cove Folder, 2011(Directed by Lily Kind) *Turn Into, 2012 (Directed by collective members, including Lynne Price, Melissa Talleda, Pilar Diaz, Clarissa Gregory, Tiffany Seal, Erin Reid) * Butterknife, 2013 (Directed by Lily Kind) *Tendao, 2013 (Including small group and solo works by collective members) * Pull Drift, 2013 (Directed by Clarissa Gregory) Adapted into a film by Meg Rorinson. ===Collaborations=== * Baltimore Dance Round Robin * Effervescent Diaspora Effervescent also collaborated with Seattle based experimental dance troupe, Pendleton House, led by Babette McGeady ==References== Category:American dance groups Category:Artists from Baltimore ","title":"Effervescent Collective"},{"id":"61297780","text":"Jill Schlabach (born ) is an American diver.

Their following releases, a 2012 split with Hobo Cubes and Tout est jeune EP, showcased an electronic- oriented sound. In 2013, Malditos Records and Teenage Menopause Records co- released the compilation Nuit de noce, which featured the tracks from the previous cassettes, as well as an unreleased track, in vinyl format. A split EP with Police des moeurs and the 7\\" single \\"Danse sociale\\" were issued in 2014 and 2015, respectively.

In 2019, the band issued Earth EP, which they regarded as \\"a tribute to late 1990s, early 2000s pop trance tracks.\\" ==Musical style and lyrics== Essaie pas's music has been described as electronic, minimal synth-pop and cold wave. Considered to be among the \\"contemporary groups reviving the DIY minimal synth sound of the 70s and 80s,\\" the band combines \\"dark, minimal synth pop, French pop, Italo- disco, and elements of horror movie soundtracks.\\" Their lyrics, spoken and sung both by Davidson and Guerineau largely in French, feature themes such as loneliness, sexuality, and fantasy. The band's sophomore album, New Path drew on the themes of \\"personal ground, on addiction, loss and the lingering strength of identity within late capitalism’s mass media paranoia.\\" The band's debut, Demain est une autre nuit was compared to \\"Giorgio Moroder and John Carpenter film scores as well as the industrial synth pop of Chris & Cosey,\\" as well as Davidson's minimal wave solo work. The band's sound also drew comparisons to the early Human League, \\"Sensoria\\"-era Cabaret Voltaire and darkwave acts such as Xeno & Oaklander and Cold Cave. New Path, which featured \\"English and French lyrics, techno beats and fear-inducing soundscapes,\\" was heavily influenced by Philip K.

In 1971, she was the first woman professor at the University of Canterbury, and possibly the first in New Zealand. == Biography == Soons was born on 18 June 1931, and grew up in a council cottage in the small English village of Great Gonerby. Her father, Lewin Soons, worked for the railways. He was a good Trade Unionist and loved reading books. Her mother, Jenny, was a hard worker. After Lewin became bedridden with tuberculosis, Jenny took over tending their large vegetable garden and orchard that provided a little income. At age eleven, Soons won a scholarship to Kesteven and Grantham Girls' School and started in the third form the year that Margaret Thatcher was a prefect at the school. In 1949, she won another scholarship, this time to University of Sheffield. She recalled that her choice to study Geography was \\"just one of those things\\"; however, she soon became enthralled with the subject. She attained a BA Hons in 1952 and DipEd in 1953, and went on to spend five months studying applied geomorphology at the University of Strasbourg. Subsequently, in 1958, she became one of the first ever woman PhD graduates in geography at the University of Glasgow. After tutoring at two British universities, she became fed-up with being overlooked for higher academic positions, due to what she described as \\"an inbred feeling that this was not a women’s world\\". Through George Jobberns she heard about a lecturer position on the other side of the world, at the University of Canterbury's Department of Geography. In 1960s Britain, the idea that a woman could combine an academic career with having a family was viewed as odd; New Zealanders, she later learnt, were, on the whole, rather less anti-woman and more relaxed. At the geography department in Christchurch, she felt accepted, and discovered that she was expected to do everything that the men did. Hard work led to promotion, promotion led to research opportunities, research led to a professorship, and a professorship made her a role model. For many years the sole woman academic staff member; by 2019 seven out of 17 academic staff in the geography department were women. Soons is nationally and internationally known for her investigations of glacier-sculpted landforms in the Rakaia Valley and her contribution to debates around environmental change in the central South Island. She served as head of department from 1990 until she retired. On her retirement in 1993, Soons was accorded the title of professor emeritus. Other highlights of her distinguished careers include being president of the International Union of Quaternary Research and convenor of the National Committee for Quaternary Research for the Royal Society. In addition to writing and collaborating on books and journal articles, she wrote an entry for the Dictionary of New Zealand Biography on George Jobberns, the geographer and educator, who played a role in her immigrating to New Zealand. Soons was never one to sit idle, and even after retirement, she taught at the Canterbury Workers' Educational Association (CWEA) and was secretary of both the UC Alumni Association and the Diamond Harbour Ladies Bowling Club. Soons died in Christchurch on 8 September 2020. == Awards == * Erskine Fellowship 1975 * David Livingstone Centenary Medal for Southern Hemisphere research (awarded by the American Geographical Society) 1988 * Royal Society Silver Medal 1994 * Honorary Doctor of Science from University of Glasgow 2009 * Distinguished New Zealand Medal (awarded by the New Zealand Geographical Society) 2001 == Selected publications == *Rainfall/runoff relationships at Cass, in the South Island high country, 1970, N.Z.

After that, he received a scholarship from the Serbian government to study philosophy in Vienna, Munich, Paris, and London. Before finishing his studies at Oxford, in 1866 he was back in Serbia, recalled by the Minister of Education, to take over the Department of Philosophy at the Grandes écoles. He was a professor of philosophy at Belgrade's Grandes écoles, Secretary of the Serbian Learned Society (from 1873 to 1882), President of the National Assembly (from 1880 to 1885), Minister of Education (1886-1887), envoy of Rome, Youth Editor of Srbadije and poet.

He is known for the song \\"I've Lost Control\\", which was released as a 12\\" single on the Trax Records label, issue number TX 113. The song used a Roland TR-808 and a Roland TB-303 bass synthesizer to create the signature modulated waveform sound which would directly inspire Acid House. The track is arguably the first to use this particular sound, and rose to cult underground popularity thanks to DJ Ron Hardy's Music Box club in Chicago. Harris died on 13 June 2019, from kidney failure. Close friend and production partner on \\"I've lost Control\\", Marshall Jefferson, paid tribute to Harris, who he called a \\"true pioneer\\". \\"Derrick was the life of every single party he went to,\\" writes Jefferson, \\"dancing from the first song to the last every time. Anyone anywhere that calls themselves a raver has this man to thank for it.\\" \\"He checked himself into the hospital and two days later was dead... just like that\\", Jefferson reflected afterwards. Harris is survived by his three sons, and did not have health insurance to cover his funeral. A crowd funding campaign was launched by Jefferson on GoFundMe, to help cover those costs. ==Sleezy D== Derrick Harris took on the nickname 'Sleezy D' from his peers in adolescence, and preferred friends to call him by that name until his death. Close friend Marshall Jefferson told The Quietus in 2013: \\"If you ever met him, you’d never forget him. Oh man, he is… sleazy.\\" After Jesse Saunders released “On and On” in 1984, a Guitar Center salesperson talked Jefferson into buying thousands of dollars worth of production gear.> Jefferson and Harris experimented with the equipment, with Marshall secretly passing demo cassettes to a local club DJ, Ron Hardy at The Music Box, under the production credit pseudonym of Virgo. However, when Jefferson's work shift patterns changed, he was unable to take down the cassettes himself, so Harris took them to the club instead. Harris started claiming that he had made the recordings. “I couldn’t go to the Music Box as much as I wanted because [the club] was midnight to noon, and I was working midnight to 8:30,” Marshall Jefferson explains. “[When I] got down to the Music Box, all of the security guards [said to Harris], ‘Hey Sleezy, hey Sleezy, all right Sleezy!’. So I try to walk in with Sleezy. Thump!” – Jefferson slaps his chest – “‘Who the [heck] are you??’ They thought Sleezy was the one making all of the music!” Jefferson and Harris collaborated on several further productions, and Jefferson was often asked during his career if he was, in fact, Sleezy D. ==\\"I've Lost Control\\" (12\\" Single)== Derrick Harris wrote about making this recording in a 2015 interview about Ron Hardy. “I’ll never forget: I came back from the Power Plant [club] one morning, at about ten or eleven o’clock – and I called Marshall,” said Sleezy. “I was like, ‘I’m feeling it, man, let’s lay down a track.’” Marshall Jefferson said “That song, it was just an 808 and a TB-303,” he recalled. “Sleezy got it right away. I wanted to basically put a nervous breakdown on vinyl.” Harris continues “I’m not going to say I was high as hell, but believe me, ‘I’ve Lost Control’ was inspired by the night I had,” he laughed. The track was completed in 1984, but not published on vinyl until 1986, becoming Trax Records 13th released single. Marshall says “When Derrick made “I’ve Lost Control” in 1984, there was absolutely nothing like it anywhere. A completely new sound that inspired clubbers all over the world, peaking with the “Summer Of Love”. The song however largely remained underground. Harris did not produce any further records, although co-produced several, including the 2016 single 'Marshall Jefferson & Full Intention Present Sleezy D - Do You Believe'. ==Godfather of Acid House== It is debated whether the first 'release' of a sound or the first 'use' of a sound constitutes 'first' status. While the 808 and 303 had been used before in other songs, \\"I've Lost Control\\" was arguably the first song to include a particular modulated waveform sound, which went on to be used extensively in the Acid House musical genre. This includes the Phuture song \\"Acid Trax\\", which was written in 1985, but published in 1986, and was the first song to commercially popularise this sound. Marshall Jefferson suggested for Channel 4 that although Harris may have discovered the original sound, DJ Pierre of Phuture probably deserves the mantle of Godfather of Acid. \\"There has been 5,000 Acid House records after Acid Trax and nobody did it like Pierre. Pierre did it in a musical way; to follow the mood of the song; everybody else just turned knobs; maan its never been done like that.\\" ==ReferencesExternal links== *Sleezy D discography at Discogs. *Ron Hardy At The Music Box Interview at the Red Bull Music Academy. *Sleezy D Facebook - Facebook page. *Obituary at The Resident Advisor.net. *Obituary at Data Transmission.co.

There are various historic structures in Douglas which are located in G Street known as the Douglas Historic District. Some of the structures are individually listed in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). Douglas has three more historical districts besides the Douglas Historic District. The other three historic districts are the Douglas Residential Historic District, the Douglas Sonoran Historic District and the Rucker Canyon Archeological District. ==Brief history== Native-Americans inhabited the area where the City of Douglas and its surrounding areas are located before the arrival of the people of European ancestry from the East Coast of the United States. The principal Native- American tribe which inhabited southeastern Arizona were the Chiricahua Apaches. They called themselves the Chiricahua Apache (Apache: \`great mountain’) after their former mountain home in southeast Arizona. Their own name true name is actually the Aiaha.Chiricahua Apache TribeNATIVE AMERICAN/APACHES HISTORYHISTORY OF WILLCOX, ARIZONA, AND ENVIRONS In the 1500s Spain claimed the area which they called New Spain, In 1535, Spanish explorer Cabeza de Vaca established a route from Mexico through the southwestern region of Arizona. Spanish Conquistadores then began to establish presidios throughout the region. Present-day Douglas is close to the San Bernardino Presidio of the late 1700s.About DouglasHistoric Douglas In 1821, the Mexican War of Independence between Mexico and Spain came to an end and the territory of New Spain, which included present-day Arizona, was ceded to Mexico.Desert USA By the mid-1800s there were many cattle ranchers in the region, among them John Horton Slaughter. In 1854, the United States purchased the region from Mexico in what is known as the Gadsden Purchase. Americans of European descent from the East Coast of the United States began to arrive in the area. Some came to work as miners and others came to establish farms and ranches which provided food to the growing population.Gadsden Purchase, 1853–1854 The Phelps Dodge Corporation selected the area as a suitable site to establish a smelter for its copper mines in Bisbee. In 1888, mining pioneer Dr. James Douglas founded the Arizona and South Eastern Railroad. By 1901, the railroad line covered Bisbee, Fairbanks, Benson and finally Douglas. That same year the line was renamed the \\"El Paso and Southwestern Railroad\\".The town was founded in 1901 and was named after Dr. James Douglas. Two copper smelters operated at the site; the Calumet and Arizona Company Smelter and the Copper Queen.The Gadsden Hotel Douglas was incorporated in 1905. It shares a border with the town of Agua Prieta, Mexico. In 1911, during the conflict known as the Border War, a United States Army camp, Camp Harry J Jones was established. During the Mexican Revolution the United States Army established Camp San Bernardino Ranch a.k.a. the Slaughter Ranch Outpost to deal with the border troubles. There are many properties listed in the National Register of Historic Places and Historic landmarks in Douglas. Among them the Hotel Gadsden, the Southern Pacific Railroad Depot, the Grand Theatre and the first international airport in the United States. The Douglas area is also home to many cattle ranches, including the historical Slaughter Ranch. The Douglas-Williams House/Museum houses a comprehensive photographic collection, which chronicles much of the city's historic past. ==Douglas Arizona Historical Society== According to the Douglas Historical Society, their mission is to promote research and education about the history of Douglas, Arizona. To acquire, protect, and preserve property, both real and personal having historical significance and value. A property may be listed in the National Register of Historic Places or it may be eligible to be listed as such, however, that does not mean that the property is safe from being demolished by its owner. According to Jim McPherson, Arizona Preservation Foundation Board President: An example is the Douglas Underpass which was located on U.S. Route 80 under Southern Pacific railroad tracks at milepost 366.1. The underpass was built in 1936 as a part of the Works Projects Administration. It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on September 30, 1988, reference: #88001609.

While serving as sheriff, he helped the United States Cavalry track the Apache chief Geronimo.SLAUGHTER, JOHN HORTON; by Amanda Oren In 1893, he purchased a large area of land there. He paid $1 dollar and twenty five cents for each foot. He purchased 60,000 feet of land and named it the Slaughter Ranch. The interesting thing about the ranch is that half of it was in the United States while the other half was in Mexico. It is located at 6153 Geronimo Trail. The ranch was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966, reference: #66000170. It was also listed as a National Historic Landmark in 1964.

The event, created by Matty Roberts on June 27, 2019, would involve raiding the site in a search for extraterrestrial life. More than 2 million people responded \\"going\\" and 1.5 million \\"interested\\" on the event's page, which subsequently attracted widespread media reaction and caused the event to become an Internet meme. Roberts later stated that the event had been purely comedic, and disavowed responsibility for any casualties if there had been any actual attempts to raid the military base. On the day of the event, only about 150 people were reported to have shown up at the entrance to Area 51, with none succeeding in entering the site. Two music festivals were planned to coincide with the event: Alienstock in Rachel, Nevada, and Storm Area 51 Basecamp in Hiko, Nevada. An estimated 1,500 people attended these festivals, according to state and local law enforcement. Air Force spokeswoman Laura McAndrews stated government officials were briefed on the event and discouraged people from attempting to enter military property. Nevada law enforcement also warned potential participants in the event against trespassing. The event had an effect on businesses both locally in Nevada and around the United States, which prepared products for visitors and those attending the event. == Background == alt= Area 51 is a common name given to a United States Air Force (USAF) facility in the Nevada Test and Training Range. Opening in 1955, the facility functioned as an aircraft testing and development facility during the Cold War. The facility is kept highly classified, protected from unauthorized entry by warning signs, electronic surveillance and armed guards. Area 51's intense secrecy has caused it to become the subject of many conspiracy theories regarding the presence of aliens on the site. These began in the 1950s, when some individuals reported seeing UFOs at the location of the base. Conspiracy theorists believe aliens, UFOs, or information related to them are stored at Area 51. The CIA declassified documents related to Area 51 and recognized its existence in 2013. == Facebook event and Internet meme == Matty Roberts, the creator of the event, devised the idea after watching Area 51 conspiracy theorist Bob Lazar and filmmaker Jeremy Corbell on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast on June 20, 2019. He created the event on Facebook on June 27, 2019 as a joke, unaware of the viral attention it would receive. * * The event was planned to take place in Amargosa Valley from 3a.m. to 6a.m. PDT on September 20, 2019. The Facebook event wrote, \\"If we naruto run, we can move faster than their bullets. Lets see them aliens\\", referring to the unique running style of anime character Naruto Uzumaki and several other characters, who run with their arms stretched behind them, head down and torso tilted forward. Roberts stated the event had only received around 40 responses three days into the event's listing and suddenly and unexpectedly went viral. The resulting meme quickly spread to other social media applications such as TikTok, Reddit, and Instagram. The Facebook page for the event was filled with thousands of satirical posts discussing topics like means of breaking into Area 51, and attempts to \\"clap alien cheeks\\", that is, engage in sexual intercourse with the aliens. The meme's virality caused Roberts to worry that he would receive a visit from the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The event received 2million \\"going\\" and another 1.5 million \\"interested\\" signatures as of August 22. * * * Rapper Lil Nas X released a music video for the Young Thug and Mason Ramsey remix of \\"Old Town Road\\" about the planned raid. * * * Copycat events such as plans to storm a genealogical vault of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Loch Ness, Bermuda Triangle and the Vatican City's archives were also created. In the Netherlands, a left-wing meme page known as \\"Memes for the Masses\\" created \\"Storm the Education Implementation Office Headquarters\\" event as a protest to student loans. == Response  Government === On July 10, speaking with The Washington Post, Air Force spokeswoman Laura McAndrews stated officials were aware of the event, and issued a warning saying: \\"[Area 51] is an open training range for the U.S. Air Force, and we would discourage anyone from trying to come into the area where we train American armed forces\\", adding that \\"[t]he U.S. Air Force always stands ready to protect America and its assets\\". A public information officer at Nellis Air Force Base told KNPR that \\"any attempt to illegally access the area is highly discouraged\\". A viral Reddit post showed what it claimed to be an Air Force briefing on the Naruto run. The FBI also stated that they would be monitoring the situation and the number of people that would come to the events. The events also prompted the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to post two temporary flight restrictions, closing the airspace above two places nearby Area 51 during the days surrounding the planned raid. The Defense Visual Information Distribution Service (DVIDS), the military's public relations office, made a Twitter post on September 20 depicting military personnel and a B-2 stealth bomber with the caption \\"The last thing #Millennials will see if they attempt the #area51raid today\\". The tweet was later deleted, and the DVIDS issued an apology. * * ===Local=== In August 2019, Lincoln County officials drafted an emergency declaration and a plan to pool resources with neighboring counties, anticipating the region being overwhelmed by a crowd of 40,000 people. The county had just 184 hotel rooms, and officials expected the local cellphone network to be unable to cope with the additional traffic; they also expressed concerns about overcrowding at campsites, gas stations, and public medical facilities. County sheriff Kerry Lee said an extra 300 paramedics and 150 police officers would be brought in from across Nevada. The town of Rachel posted a caution on its website, advising attendees to be \\"experienced in camping, hiking and surviving in a harsh desert environment and have a vehicle in good shape\\". They advised that the town would likely be unable to provide sufficient food, water or gas to visitors, and expected local law enforcement to be overwhelmed. The website warned that local residents would readily protect their property, predicting that Alienstock would be \\"Fyre Festival 2.0\\". * * === Businesses === Business owners in and around Rachel, Nevada, a town of just 56 people just outside of the base, made preparations for visitors who planned to go to Area 51. Connie West, co-owner of the Little A'Le'Inn restaurant and inn, had all 13 rooms of the inn booked and planned to open up 30 acres for camping, also stating she would possibly create merchandise for the event. Las Vegas businessman George Harris planned to hire bands to play at an annual festival called \\"The Swarm\\". Kosmic Kae, owner of the shop Aliens R Us in Boulder City, stated that even though the shop was 170 miles away from Area 51, business had increased due to fascination regarding aliens. Other businesses around the U.S. based products and services on the event, and a collection of merchandise related to the event was launched from online retailers. Bud Light planned to release a promotional alien-themed beer label and promised a free beer to \\"any alien that makes it out\\" as long as a tweet showing the new design received 51,000 retweets. * * * Fast food restaurant Arby's had planned to deliver food with a special menu to the event. ==Gathering and music festivals== While the event was intended as comedic, some took it seriously, and traveled to areas surrounding the facility. Beginning on September 19, the day before the planned event date, people were reported to be showing up and camping around Rachel in preparation for the raid. The Lincoln County Sheriff estimated that about 1,500 people showed up at the festivals, while about 150 people made the journey over several miles of rough roads to the main gate of Area 51. Some camped overnight outside the perimeter of the base while others arrived to gather and take selfies near the front gate before leaving. One person attempted to enter the facility and received a warning, while six others were arrested for crimes including public urination, alcohol related offenses and indecent exposure. * * * Two music festivals were announced in the county in response to the event's popularity: Alienstock in Rachel, Nevada, and Storm Area 51 Basecamp in Hiko, Nevada. Local governments and police feared that even these legal events could be problematic if too many individuals attended. Event creator Roberts pulled out of Alienstock 10 days before the festival, leaving other organizers and booked entertainers to run the event. Roberts claimed his last minute departure with $70,000–$100,000 in sponsorship money and donations was \\"due to poor planning\\" and he instead joined an alien themed party already planned in Las Vegas, although the Little A'Le'Inn owner Connie West continued with the name Alienstock in Rachel, Nevada. Roberts' lawyers sent her a cease and desist regarding use of the name, but West was in possession of all of the \\"Alienstock\\" permits and ignored the legal threats. * * After the raid, Keith Wright, a promoter for the Area 51 Basecamp event, stated the event was a failure. However, Connie West, who organized Alienstock, declared her event a success. The event's aftermath saw several pending lawsuits surrounding the festival and Roberts' call to breach the government facility. Although much less than the estimated 30,000 attendees expected before Roberts' departure and press campaign claiming Alienstock was canceled, the event was thought to have brought the largest influx of people ever to visit Lincoln County, Nevada. ==ReferencesFacebook event * NoAlienStock site Category:Facebook Category:Internet memes introduced in 2019 Category:September 2019 events in the United States Category:UFO culture in the United States Category:2019 in Nevada ","title":"Storm Area 51"},{"id":"61298047","text":"Richard Philip Oliver (1763–14 April 1843), later known as Richard Oliver Gascoigne, was an Irish landowner at Castle Oliver in County Limerick and Parlington Hall in Yorkshire. ==Biography== He was the eldest surviving son of Silver Oliver, and like his father sat in the Irish House of Commons for County Limerick.

Patrick Marber, who worked with Stoppard on the revival of Travesties in London and New York, is directing and commented that \\"It’s a big company play which as a director is incredibly exciting to do. It’s got the lot.” The play is set among the Jewish community of Vienna in the first half of the 20th century and follows the lives of \\"a prosperous Jewish family who had fled the pogroms in the East\\". According to Stoppard the play \\"took a year to write, but the gestation was much longer. Quite a lot of it is personal to me, but I made it about a Viennese family so that it wouldn’t seem to be about me.” Stoppard discovered in the early 1990s that his four grandparents had been Jewish and died in Nazi concentration camps.

The predatory behavior of this nematode presents the opportunity to use it as a bio-control agent against other plant parasitic nematodes. It has been shown to have a preference for the second stage juveniles of Meloidogyne incognita. == Distribution / Morphology == M. fortidens may be found in decomposing organic manure.. Morphological features include lips with setose papillae, large amphid aperatures, and a mobile claw-like tooth. The female is diovarial and amphidelphic, while the male is without bursa and has nine pairs of genital papillae. The tails of both the male and female are filiform == Predatory Behavior == M. fortidens prefers small, slow moving prey.. Once they’ve pierced the cuticle, they feed by cutting and sucking or swallowing their prey whole. They have also been shown to aggregate and feed from prey in groups. This positive aggregation response may be in part due to prey secretions/attractions that M. fortidens senses. Other factors affecting attraction include prey number, temperature, starvation, and distance between predator and prey. Bilgrami and Jairajpuri found that attraction to prey improved when prey number increased and when M. fortidens was starved for 12 days. Predation of Meloidogyne incognita by M. fortidens plateaued at temperatures between 30 and 35°C == Bio-Control Applications == The use of predatory nematodes as a biological control agent for plant-parasitic nematodes was suggested by Cobb.. M. fortidens is a reasonable choice for bio- control due to its short life cycle and easy culturability. M. fortidens was used in experiments investigating their potential as a bio-control for the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne arenaria in tomato. Khan and Kim found that the final population of M. arenaria decreased exponentially with increasing application densities of M. fortidens. When pots were treated with M. fortidens 7 days prior to planting, plant growth increased while root galling and final populations of M. arenaria decreased significantly == References == Category:Rhabditida Category:Nematodes described in 1951 ","title":"Mononchoides fortidens"},{"id":"61298116","text":"is a Japanese table tennis player.

Coleman (1870-1943) was one of Tennessee's first African-American woman physicians. She was a religious feminist and suffragist who was instrumental in building alliances between black and white women. ==Life== Coleman née Howard was born in Sumner County, Tennessee on July 3, 1870, the oldest of four children of an African Methodist Episcopal (AME) minister. After completing high school at the Walden University high school, Coleman graduated from Central Tennessee College in 1885. She married the Reverend P. J. Coleman in 1902. When she married, she converted to her husband's denomination, the Colored Methodist Episcopal (CME) Church. She graduated from Meharry Medical College in 1906, becoming one of the nation's first black female physicians. Coleman died on August 12, 1943 in Nashville. == Social Activism == Dr. Coleman established a medical practice in Clarksville, Tennessee, providing medical assistance to the needy. With other black women seeking to improve social justice for African Americans, such as education and health care, she was active in women’s religious and secular societies. She was a founder in 1918 of the Woman’s Connectional Missionary Council, the first woman-run society within the Colored Methodist Episcopal Church (CME), and became its first president, a position she held for 20 years, until a few years before she died. In that role she worked closely with white women of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South. She worked with them, for example, on the sponsorship of the Bethlehem House settlement. The Bethlehem House provided a kindergarten, sewing schools, and Bible story hour, among other services. Neverdon-Morton 166-68. Mattie Coleman recognized that white organizations could help black women achieve their social goals in a world where black women had limited agency and that black women could help white women define their own agendas. Both white women and black women wanted more leadership roles in their churches. In a speech as CME Connectional Ministry Council president, Coleman called upon the male church hierarchy for \\"an equal chance\\" to do the work \\"that is justly ours.\\" Coleman enlisted white women to help black women gain independent roles in the church, even before white women had achieved that goal in their own churches. When Coleman addressed the first meeting of the CME Woman's Connectional Missionary Council in 1918, she observed, \\"There has always been a close relationship between the sisters of the M.E. Church, South and the sisters of the C.M.E. Church....We have long since realized that each one is dependent on the other.\\" Goodstein speculates that because of her leadership among CME women and their work with the white ME, South women, she \\"may very well have initiated the biracial alliance\\" in Nashville. This alliance was critical both to social justice goals and to suffrage. For example, black women sought a vocational school for delinquent black children. White suffragists recognized the organizational skills of Mattie Coleman and Juno Frankie Pierce From 1939 until 1943 Coleman served as superintendent of the Tennessee State Vocational School for Girls. == Suffrage == Coleman was also an advocate for women's suffrage.

His mother married Peter Leigh of Nottingham after his father's death. Robert inherited the Wollaton and Middleton estates from his half brother Richard in 1471. It took a further two decades for him to take full possession, since his mother Margaret Leigh had an interest in Wollaton, while his grandmother Margaret Bingham spent her life in the Middleton estate, the Dunsby and Wigtoft estates in Lincolnshire, and the manors of Gunthorpe and Lowdham in Nottinghamshire. At the origin of the Willoughby (Willuby) surname there is record of the Bugge family. They were either the original inhabitants of the town of Wollaton, or settled in it about the time of King John, rising to considerable eminence. From them sprung the Willoughbies of Wollaton. Radulphus Bugge was an ancestor of diverse good families as observed in Willoughby-on-the-Wolds. He was a wealthy merchant and purchased the lands in 1240–41. Probably buried at St.Peter's church (Nottingham). He had two sons, Richard and Radulphus, the latter having been the father of Richard de Bingham. Richard's son, Richard de Willoughby was Knighted by King Edward II in 1325, and increased their patrimony exceedingly as a very rich lawyer. Richard's son was Richard de Willoughby, a Justice of the Common Pleas for 28 years in the days of Edward III, who also appears to have had a few higher appointments in his career. From his second wife, Joana (Matilda) he had a son, Sir Edmund Willoughby, who inherited the bulk of the property. In the second subsequent generation Sir Hugh married Margaret Freville and started a Barony named after the estates. Sir Henry was their grandson and a distinguished man in his day. ==Career== The Field of the Cloth of Gold, oil painting of c.1545. Henry VIII on horseback approaches at bottom left. Sir Henry could be the figure looking over the Queen, in front of what appears to be an Herald.He was a servant of the royal household under Richard III, and a Knight of the Body to both Kings Henry VII and Henry VIII. At the beginning of his reiving and cavalry days, Henry and his brother Richard were remained and tried for the abduction of Jane Statham. This happened after the latter become widowed at the outcome of the battle of Bosworth in 1485. The heiress of the House of York was also forcibly married to Richard and taken from her family. As a consequence, the Willoughbys had to pay large sums in compensation to the victim and affected family members, the marriage having also been annulled. The incident seems to have hardly affected their prosperity. He was later knighted at the battle of Stoke by Henry VII in June 1487, and served in Flanders in 1489. Sir Henry maintained a retinue on behalf of the King, and campaigned in Brittany in 1491. He also defended Blackheath in 1497 during the Cornish rebellion. He was Master-General of the Ordnance to Henry VIII in 1512 and raised a retinue of more than 800 men to campaign in Spain, during the conquest of Iberian Navarre. He also fought at the Battle of the Spurs in 1513. He attended to Queen Catherine of Aragon at the Field of the Cloth of Gold summit in 1520. He had much influence in the Midlands thanks to his great wealth, based mostly on coal from the Wollaton pits, which he exploited with fresh vigour. He became a Justice of the peace in Nottinghamshire from 1492 for the remainder of his life. He held the same position in Lincolnshire and Warwickshire, and served as Sheriff for all three counties. He was buried in St Leonard's Church, Wollaton where he rests today in his canopied tomb, with effigies to all his wives. ==Family== He married firstly Margaret c.1470, daughter of Sir Robert Markham (d. 1490). They had the following children: * Sir John (died 1549), married Anne, daughter of Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Lisle in 1486 * Edward (d. 1541), married Anne, daughter of Sir William Filliol in 1518–19, and had: ** Henry (d. 1549) married Anne Grey (d.1548), daughter of Thomas Grey, 2nd Marquess of Dorset, and had: *** Thomas (d.1559) *** Francis (1547 – 1596) *** Margaret, who married Sir Matthew Arundell (c. 1533 – 1598) of Wardour Castle. * Jane, who married the grandson of Ralph Percy, Sir Guiscard Harbottle of Beamish (d.

She attended Englewood High School in Chicago. ==Career== Hunter's first paid singing performance came when she appeared with Red Saunders and his orchestra at Club DeLisa on Chicago's South Side. She was signed by Discovery Records in 1950. In 1951, Hunter was a featured performer with George Shearing and his quintet at Birdland in New York City. Later that year, she was among a group of \\"rising young stars of jazz\\" presented at the Streamliner night club in Chicago. Other Chicago venues at which she performed included the Club Silhouette and the Cloister Inn, where an initial four-week booking turned into a 2.5-year stay. Her work in other cities included singing at the Jazz Villa in St. Louis, the Roosevelt Hotel in New York, and the Circus Lounge in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. In 1961, Hunter began recording for Atlantic, with \\"Blue and Sentimental\\" as her first album for that label. She also recorded for RCA Victor. In 1963, Hunter became the first African-American performer hired by WBBM radio in Chicago. After a successful on-air audition, she became a member of the staff of the all-live Music Wagon Show.

However, it ruled in Hunter's favor on the basis that she was the first person to \\"adopt and establish the name Lonesome Gal as a personality\\" and that name was exclusively associated with her. Damages of $22,500 were awarded to Hunter, and the company was ordered to destroy all material containing Hunter's likeness in conjunction with \\"Lonesome Gal\\". ==Personal life== On December 7, 1952, Hunter married Charles Taylor, a shoe salesman.

Leti leti is a type of traditional transport vessel from East Madura, Indonesia, especially from the administrative district of Sumenep.Stenross. (2007). p. 83. The leti leti is a recent development, the hull form and sail were developed in the 19th century. In 1979 sailing leti leti was numbered about 1000, but this was reduced in the next decades when more modern, motorized vessel appeared.Horridge. (1981). p. 82. ==Etymology== Sekar Aman, a leti leti used for sailing to Australian shores to collect trepang (sea slug), turtle shell and trade with Indigenous Australians. Leti leti is also known with other names and pronunciation, like leti-leti, letelete, lete lete, letek-letek, leteh-leteh, parao lete', and golekan lete. The origin of the name is unknown. In early 20th century the type was referred to in different publications as tekletek. This is however the same name, with the first syllable dropped: [le]tek-letek, as in [a]lisalis. It may also possible that the name comes from the sail it used, the Madurese crab claw sail, or lete sail, which has just developed in the 19th century. In fact, the \\"lete\\" from lete sail is a local pronunciation of lateen sail, although the existence of lower yard indicate that it is a crab claw sail. == Description == A beached perahu lete' gole'an. It is a \\"fat\\" vessel with short sternpost, with short mast located at the frontside of the deckhouse wall. They are using triangular sail with very long upper yard. The roof of the deckhouse oftentimes was steep with aftside being higher. At the sea, the small foresail often placed in the bow, and the third sail can be placed above the deckhouse. Madurese leti leti has pointed deckhouse roof with vertical post to support the rudder.Horridge. (1981). p. 82. Leti leti from Giligenting, easily recognized by squared 'doghouse' abaft the main gabled deckhouse, were common sight at the late 1940s in ports all around the Java Sea, from Sumbawa to Riau. Leti leti from Sapudi distinguishable from Giligenting vessels by the lack of 'doghouse' aft, and were regarded as the most authentic examples of leti leti type. Some vessels from 1970s onward were very large, the largest of all leti leti, and following the motorization in early 1980s, some of them became larger, of a size to rival the largest Bugis vessels.Stenross. (2007). p. 112. Leti-leti has about 12-41 tons gross tonnage,Stenross. (2007). p. 242. while the larger leti leti is about 50 gt in weight.Stenross. (2007). p. 244. The leti leti was an optimal design of small sailing cargo vessel for the Java sea, stoutly built with great load carrying capacity for its length and draught. A full laden leti leti usually doesn't have freeboard.Stenross. (2007). p. 110. It can be crewed by only 2 crew, one is controlling the rudder, the other one managing the sails. ==Role== A leti leti in a slipway. Cirebon, October 1947. Fundamentally, leti leti is a merchant vessel used by Madurese people, just like pinisi of Bugis sailors.Horridge. (1981). p. 83. Leti leti can be found in northern side of Timor islands to Singapore, but this vessel can also fish as far as Australian coast. Traditionally Madurese traders brought cattles to East Java from as far as Roti island and Kupang in Timor, they also carried salt, rice, and assembled goods out from Surabaya.Horridge. (1981). p. 84. Modern leti leti, nevertheless, is not the right type of trading perahu for Eastern Indonesian islands: This boat couldn't sail through low tide straits or they're needed a long time to pass, or dealing with blowing winds and gusts around mountainous islands, so the type of perahu used there currently is the lambo.Horridge. (1981). p. 85. == Mandarese leti leti == sandalwood horses are washed alongside 2 type of Mandarese prahu (lètè and pakoer). Since 1930s Mandar sailors has adopted the leti leti as one of their small trading perahu along with lambo and bago from West Sulawesi. Originally they got it from Madurese living alongside them in the mixed communities around Java sea such as Marumasa, Masalembu, and Kangean islands, but the current Mandarese vessels always different from Madura vessels. Their difference are Mandar-styled rudder mounting, flat roof on its deckhouse, the absence of paint pattern and black-colored stempost, but always clean, tidy, and organized. They also have flat, blade-shaped rudder that acts as centreboard at the stern of the vessel. In the 1970s many of them can be found on Paotere harbor, Makassar. In the present, they expand its trading range to around the Flores sea and Java sea to overcome poverty in homes.Horridge.

She was long associated with the Catch a Rising Star comedy club in New York City, as a performer, club manager and the club's first woman emcee. She also performed on Broadway and in cabaret shows and was a graphic artist. She was married to fellow comedian and writer Bill Scheft. ==Early life== Tolsch grew up an only child in the Flatbush neighborhood of Brooklyn. She attended Erasmus Hall High School, and got an arts degree from Brooklyn College. Her family was Jewish. From a young age she idolized Lenny Bruce, so her father once snuck her into a Bruce show in the Village by claiming she was a midget. ==Career== Tolsch's first career was as a graphic artist, doing architectural renderings among other work. She eventually left this work after starting comedy in 1976. She began performing improv with The Original Cast troupe before starting in stand-up comedy. Performing had an allure for her. \\"The first time I ever got a standing ovation, you could have taken me right to comic heaven. It was such an affirmation. It's attention, love, it's everything but food and rent.\\" At that time, there were few women working in standup comedy, and fewer still could earn a full-time living at it. When Tolsch herself first started in comedy, she kept her day job as a commercial graphic artist while performing at night. During this time, the women comics in New York would often congregate on Sundays at Tolsch's West Side apartment. \\"There are so few of us that we need to get together. The camaraderie is essential and we are so all over the lot that we don't get to talk together all that much.\\" She eventually became a success in the New York City comedy club circuit, and became the first woman emcee at Catch a Rising Star. She also managed the club for years, and served as a mentor for young comics. She considered comedian Richard Belzer to be her mentor, as he had helped her get her start at Catch a Rising Star. In 1981 she was the only woman emcee in any of the New York clubs, in part because she was adept at dealing with hecklers. She toured as a comedian, appearing in comedy clubs throughout all over the United States and in England and Australia. In her career she opened for such acts as Jay Leno, The Pointer Sisters, Bobby Vinton, Pat Cooper and Billy Crystal. Tolsch also appeared on Broadway in the comedy review 3 From Brooklyn in 1992 at the Helen Hayes Theatre. She also co-hosted a weekly syndicated radio show called The Better Sex. Her last project was the documentary film Take My Nose...Please: Women, Comedy and Plastic Surgery which she and Scheft executive produced together. The film was directed by journalist Joan Kron and examines the pressure on women to be attractive, via comedy. ==Awards and honors== Tolsch on stage Oct 2015 She won Outstanding Female Stand-Up Comic at New York City's MAC Awards in 1990, 1991 and 1994. Her one-woman shows Trucks, Guns and Mayonnaise (2004) (which was about her life on the road as a comic} and None of Your Damn Business (2006) both won cabaret awards. The documentary Take My Nose...Please won the audience awards at the Miami Film Festival and the Berkshire International Film Festival. ==Personal life== Tolsch was married to comedian and writer Bill Scheft, who she met when he (at first unsuccessfully) auditioned for her at Catch a Rising Star in December 1980. They moved in together in 1984 and married in June 1990. She was an avid crossworder along with Scheft. She died of esophogeal cancer on December 7, 2016.

In 2004 she won the Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz Prize for her work Ya no pisa la tierra tu rey (Your King No Longer Treads the Earth). Her 2014 novel Las Inviernas was a finalist for the Premio Herralde, and in translation (by Samuel Ritter as The Winterlings) won two English PEN awards. == Biography == Cristina Sánchez-Andrade was born in Santiago de Compostela on 5 April 1968, the daughter of a Galician father and an English mother. She has a licentiate in information sciences from the Complutense University, one in law from the National University of Distance Education, and a master's degree in community law from the Autonomous University of Madrid, the city where she resides. She divides her time between writing and English–Spanish translation, as well as teaching narrative workshops, and her own work has been translated into several languages. She has been a guest speaker at several international universities and literary festivals. == Writing career == Sánchez-Andrade's stories have earned several literary awards, and in 1999 she published Las lagartijas huelen a hierba, a novel about the search for identity that was well-received for its narrative originality and structure. Bueyes y rosas dormían (2001), her second novel, is set in an indefinite time, in an oppressive, fictional, and archetypal place called Pueblo. With Ya no pisa la tierra tu rey, she won the 2004 Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz Prize, awarded by the Guadalajara International Book Fair. The novel, with a collective protagonist – a congregation of nuns – reveals a recurring theme: criticism of collective manifestations that may lead people to think not as individuals but as a mass, and to make decisions not out of reflection and personal evaluation, but because of that weakness that comes from the need to belong to the flock and shelter in it. Her 2007 novel Coco tells the story of French designer Coco Chanel, and she returned to this format to narrate the life of Christina of Norway, a 13th-century medieval princess who traveled to Spain to marry an infant brother of King Alfonso X. This historical novel was published in 2010 with the title ', and was a finalist for the Spartacus Historical Novel Award in 2011. Moving away from fiction, Sánchez-Andrade published ' (2010), a collection of anecdotes and sincere reflections from day-to-day life with her daughter Julieta, who has Down syndrome. With Las Inviernas (2014), she won recognition on the international literary scene. Highly praised by the Spanish and foreign press, it has been translated into English, German, Italian, Portuguese, Polish, and Italian. In addition to being a finalist for the Premio Herralde in 2014 and the Premio Mandarache in 2016, it received two English PEN awards, one for translation and one for the promotion of it. In this novel, two sisters return to their hometown after years of absence because of the Spanish Civil War. Both have a secret related to their grandfather, and their presence agitates consciences and stirs up the lives of neighbors. Through oral testimony, it immerses readers in the atmosphere of inner Galicia. The stories on which it was based, mostly told by the author's paternal grandmother, involve premonitions, visions, and appearions derived from superstition and religion. 47 trocitos, her first children's novel, is a humorous story that talks about diversity and the importance of accepting others as they are. The plot of Alguien bajo los párpados (2017) unites two stories set in the same surroundings and distanced in time. One, contemporary, refers to a car trip by a wealthy lady, Mrs. Olvido, and her maid, Bruna. The other goes back to the Republic, the Civil War, and the beginning of the Franco regime. The trip fosters the recovery of the past and the panoramic painting of a peculiar family group whose center is occupied by the lady and her usual servant- companion. In 2014, Sánchez-Andrade was the guest author of the Hawthornden Literary Retreat in Scotland. In 2017 she was guest author at Villa Sarkia in Finland, and that year she also received a Cultura Viva National Award for narrative. == Bibliography == * 1999: Las lagartijas huelen a hierba * 2001: Bueyes y rosas dormían (Siruela) * 2003: Ya no pisa la tierra tu rey (winner of the 2004 Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz Prize and translated into English as Your King No Longer Treads the Earth by W.

Neo-Nazism in Costa Rica is a social phenomenon that emerged at the beginning of the 21st century. It usually extends between skinheads groups mostly composed of young people. The Costa Rican neo-Nazis focus their rejection towards Jews, blacks, Asians, homosexuals, communists, feminists and, especially, Nicaraguan, Colombian, Dominican, Lebanese and other nationalities. ==First groups== The first group to have notoriety for the media coverage it represented was the so-called National Socialist Party of Costa Rica, whose leader named Gregorio and known by the alias \\"Pretoriano SS\\" was interviewed by the newspaper La Nación in 2003. Gregorio himself was the son of Nicaraguan migrants, although he claimed that they were \\"white\\". Other groups that have records of their existence, at least virtual, are the Costa Rican National Socialist Youth, New Social Order, Costa Rican National Socialist Ideological Resistance (which appears as the Costa Rican member in the World Union of National Socialists) and the esotericist Costa Rican Society of the Hyperborean Spear attached to the esoteric hitlerism of Miguel Serrano. == Neo-nazi police officer== In April 2012, it became publicly known that a Costa Rican police officer posed on social networks using Nazi symbols and carrying out the fascist salute, causing a furore among public opinion. Moreover, the officer himself claimed not to be alone but that there was a full group of supporters of German Nazism among the police. Although this was never determined, it was established that the person was a police officer. The young man was identified as Ronald \\"Murdock\\" Herrera and father of three daughters. Herrera was suspended almost immediately and then fired for loss of confidence, being the only person so far to be fired from the Public Force by Nazi sympathies. Subsequent reports showed that after his departure from the police, Herrera had serious difficulties in finding a job and taking care of his family, and suffered threats from anti-Fascists. It was reported that he committed suicide on April 2, 2016. ==Recent events== In 2015, the Simon Wiesenthal Center asked the Costa Rican government to shut down a store in San José that sells Nazi paraphernalia, Holocaust denial books and other products associated with Nazism. In 2018, it transpired that a series of pages of the social network Facebook of neo-Nazi inclination openly or discreetly carried out a vast campaign instigating xenophobic hatred by recycling old news or divulging Fake news to take advantage of an anti-immigrant sentiment after three homicides to tourists allegedly committed by migrants (although from one of the homicides the suspect is Costa Rican). A rally against the country's migration policy was made on August 19, 2018, in which neo-Nazi and hooligans took part. Although not all participants were linked these groups and the majority of participants were peaceful, the protest turned violent and the Public Force had to intervene with a balance of 44 arrested, 36 Costa Ricans and the rest Nicaraguans. To the neo-Nazis were confiscated different types of sharp weapons, Molotov cocktails and other items, as well as being identified with swastika flags. A subsequent anti-xenophobic march and solidarity with the Nicaraguan refugees was organized a week later with more assistance. A second anti-migration demonstration but with the explicit exclusion of neo-Nazis and hooligans was carried out in September with similar assistance. In 2019 Facebook pages of extreme right-wing tendencies and anti-immigration position as Deputy 58, Costa Rican Resistance and Salvation Costa Rica called an anti- government demonstration on May 1 with small attendance. ==References== Category:Costa Rican nationalism Category:Far-right politics in Costa Rica Costa Rica ","title":"Neo-Nazism in Costa Rica"},{"id":"61299364","text":"Aurora Arc is the ninth studio album by Japanese band Bump of Chicken, released through Toy's Factory on July 10, 2019.

Following these travels, he produced rural scenes that attracted the attention of the Duchess of Berry and Louis-Philippe I. In addition to these scenes, he produced works illustrating the history of France; notably a depiction of Joan of Arc, swearing her devotion to the salvation of France, which is now at the Palais de Fontainebleau, and works inspired by literature; Walter Scott in particular. His \\"Old Mortality\\" is on display at the Louvre. He was, in fact, generally an enthusiast for the Anglomania that developed in France in the 1830s; becoming a member of the circle that surrounded Richard Parkes Bonington, and was one of the first French artists to become interested in the works of John Constable. His friend, Eugène Delacroix, subsequently became a great admirer of Constable after Regnier presented him with some lithographs from his collection.Eugène Delacroix, Journal, p. 106, Nouvelle édition intégrale établie par Michèle Hannoosh, « Domaine romantique », Éditions Corti, 2009. He was also influenced by the young Victor Hugo, and was inspired to pursue his romantic vision of Old Paris. In 1825, with the help of his student, Jean-Jacques Champin, he began creating an illustrated book on the subject, which would be called Vues pittoresques des principaux châteaux et des maisons de plaisance des environs de Paris et des départements lithographié par Auguste Regnier. This was followed by La Seine et ses abords (1836), Habitations des personnages les plus célèbres de France depuis 1790 jusqu'à nos jours and Promenade dans les rues de Paris, Dessins d’Auguste Regnier, Lithographiés Jean Jacques Champin. Notices de Charles Nodier (1838). As a result, he was named a Chevalier in the Legion of Honor in 1837 and received commissions from King Louis-Philippe to do illustrations of the and the Château de Versailles. Despite this success with the aristocracy, he fell victim to the increasing fashion for Realism and his career effectively came to an end together with the July Monarchy in 1848. == References  Further reading == * Véronique Miltgen, Peintures du XIXe siècle 1800-1914, Musée des beaux-arts de Tours, 2001. * Eugène Delacroix, Journal, new edition, restored by Michèle Hannoosh, Éditions Corti, 2009, pgs.106 and 2314 == External links == * More works by Regnier @ ArtNet * \\"Jacques Auguste Regnier\\", works @ L'Agence Photo * \\"Jacques Auguste Regnier\\" @ the Base Joconde.

He owned a portion of land along the fort of Vicsadol in Valkó County, near present-day Vučedol (\\"Wolf's Valley\\"), located six kilometers downstream from the town of Vukovar, Croatia. Vicsadoli served as provost of the cathedral chapter of Kalocsa at least from 1309 to 1351. He was a well- educated cleric, skilled in canon law. ==Archbishop-elect== After the death of Vincent in the summer of 1311, Vicsadoli was elected as his successor by the joint session of the cathedral chapter of Kalocsa and the collegiate chapter of Bács (today Bač, Serbia). He requested papal legate, Gentile Portino da Montefiore to confirm his election and even paid a procuratio of 18 marks to the papal legate. However, Gentile was recalled to the Roman Curia by Pope Clement V in order to participate in the Council of Vienne. Gentile left Hungary on 10 September 1311. Pope Clement required a personal appearance of Vicsadoli before the Holy See, but the archbishop-elect was unable to travel to Avignon, because the lands of his archdiocese was threatened and seized by the Serbian troops of Stefan Uroš II Milutin. Vicsadoli sent his envoys to the Council of Vienne, but the pope refused to meet the delegation, which then continued to travel to Malause in the Diocese of Vaison, but the audience did not happen here either. There, Pope Clement commissioned cardinal Pietro Colonna studying the case. The pope called on the archbishop-elect to visit the court personally on 29 December 1312. It is not known whether the trip has been occurred or not. Despite the lack of confirmation of his election, Vicsadoli functioned as apostolic administrator of the archdiocese. Pope Clement V died in April 1314, and his successor, Pope John XXII was elected only after a two-year period of election procedure and took office in August 1316. The new pope established a committee of cardinals in order to fill the position of Archbishop of Kalocsa. After hearing its report, Pope John decreed that the election of Vicsadoli would be annulled for \\"some reason\\", as his charter indicated. Historian Menyhért Érdújhelyi considered Vicsadoli was a domestic opponent to the ruling Capetian House of Anjou or he was not a favored subject in the royal court. Charles I of Hungary proposed his protege and personal confessor Ladislaus Jánki to become the new archbishop. Pope John appointed Jánki as Archbishop of Kalocsa on 3 July 1317. == References  Sources == * * Category:Archbishops of Kalocsa Category:13th-century Hungarian people Category:14th-century Hungarian people ","title":"Demetrius Vicsadoli"},{"id":"61300020","text":"Crowan Cottage, at 1401 Woodstock Ave. in Anniston, Alabama, is a house believed to have been designed by architect Stanford White and built in 1886.

According to a spokesman for Mojahedin-e Khalq, an Iranian opposition group which advocates the end of Iran's clerical regime, several of the group's units had carried out the killings in northern Tehran. Mojahedin-e Khalq claimed the responsibility for the assassination of Asadollah Lajevardi, a former Iranian chief prosecutor and head of Iran's Prisons Organization, who was assassinated on 23 August 1998. Ali Sayyad Shirazi had personally commanded several of Iran's major offensives in the Iran–Iraq War, earning him the nickname \\"Iron Man\\". ==Assassination== Ali Sayyad Shirazi was fatally shot by an unknown assailant while leaving home for work.

According to Rahim Safavi, commenting 11 years after Sayyad Shirazi's death, the assassination operation was carried out at Saddam Hussein's order. A Mujahedeen Khalq spokesman said that Shirazi had been targeted because for \\"purging and executing military personnel and for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of teen-agers in the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980's, in which he commanded Iran's ground forces.\\" ===Perpetrator=== Shahin Gobadi, the spokesman for MEK in Paris, told the Associated Press in Cairo via a telephone call that \\"the group's units inside Iran were responsible for the killing.\\" Zahra Ghaemi was described by the Iranian media as being in the charge of the assassination team. ===Aftermath=== Sayyad Shirazi's funeral was held the day after the attack.

The construction cost of US-$ 21 million was funded by the Korean Agency for Cooperation (KOICA). The building was built after a construction period of 33 months in cooperation between experts of the DR Congo and the Republic of Korea under modern aspects (locally available construction materials, use of solar energy, natural air circulation with only partial use of air conditioning, etc.) and represents the largest cultural policy investment of South Korea in Central Africa to date. left In three public exhibition halls of 6,000 m², 12,000 objects can be presented in their cultural context.

Unlike in the past, when the director and scientific cooperation had been provided for decades by Belgian scientists from the Africa Museum in Brussels, Congolese experts have now been trained in South Korea. Thus, the Congolese cultural politicians have put their international cooperation on a broader basis than before. The museum was opened to the public on 23 November 2019 by the President of the DR Congo, Félix Tshisekedi. Referring to requests for the repatriation of Congolese cultural heritage from museums in Europe, Tshisekedi said: \\"We support the return of the scattered cultural heritage, especially in Belgium.

Prince Henry, born 19 February 1594, was the first child of James VI of Scotland and Anne of Denmark, heir to the throne of Scotland and potentially, England.Michael Bath, 'Rare Shewes, the Stirling Baptism of Prince Henry' in Journal of the Northern Renaissance, no. 4 (2012). William Fowler composed the masque and wrote an account of the celebrations in A True Reportarie of the Baptisme of the Prince of Scotland (1594) printed in Edinburgh and London.Henry Meikle, The Works of William Fowler, vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 1936), pp. 169–95. An English spectator also made a report of the events.Thomas Rymer, Foedera, vol. 16 (London, 1715), pp. 263–4. The programme owed much to French Valois court festival, while some aspects were attuned to please English audiences and readers of Fowler's book. There was a tournament in exotic costume and a masque during which desserts were served, while Latin mottoes were displayed and verses sung to music. A maritime theme involving a ship laden with fish made of sugar represented the safe sea crossing made in 1590 by Anne of Denmark and James, the North Star, despite the \\"conspiracies of witches\\".Martin Wiggins & Catherine Richardson, British Drama 1533–1642: A Catalogue: 1590–1597, vol. 3 (Oxford, 2013), pp. 245–7. The event was delayed by waiting for the completion of the new Chapel Royal designed by William Schaw and described as the new Temple of Solomon,Miles Glendinning & Aonghus McKechnie, Scottish Architecture (Thames & Hudson, 2004), p. 61: Ian Campbell & Aonghus Mackechnie, 'The ‘Great Temple of Solomon’ at Stirling Castle', Architectural History, vol. 54 (2011), pp. 91–118. and the arrival of the English ambassador's party.Clare McManus, Women on the Renaissance Stage: Anna of Denmark and female masquing in the Stuart Court (Manchester, 2002), p. 79. ==Events== The ambassadors from the relatives of Anna of Denmark arrived at Leith on 12 and 13 July 1594. She left Edinburgh for Falkland Palace to avoid receiving them because Holyrood Palace was not magnificent enough, and it was said that the building of the \\"great Temple of Solomon\\", the Chapel Royal, was not complete. The events were postponed until Stirling Castle was ready, and the English ambassador arrived, on 28 August.Annie I. Cameron, Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 11 (Edinburgh, 1936), pp. 376–7. ==Tournaments at the castle== The tournament was held in The Valley to the south of the castle, since 1857 a part of the Old Town Cemetery. The first event was a competition called \\"running at the ring\\" in which horseriders collect hoops with lances. There were three teams, one dressed as the Christian Knights of Malta, one in Turkish fashion, and three men dressed as Amazons. A fourth team, to be dressed as Africans called \\"Moors\\" did not show up. The event was held in the valley by the castle, and watched by the queen, Anne of Denmark, with her ladies-in-waiting, and the ambassadors. The audience was swelled by a large crowd of young men from Edinburgh armed with muskets.William Fowler, A True Reportarie (Edinburgh, 1594), text Early English Books Online. The \\"Christian Knights\\" were James VI; the Earl of Mar; and Thomas Erskine of Gogar. The \\"Turks\\" were the Duke of Lennox; Lord Home; Sir Robert Kerr of Cessford. The \\"Amazons\\" were the Lord Lindores; the Laird of Buccleuch; and the Abbot of Holyroodhouse. These all bore devices or imprese pertaining to the themes of the festival.Michael Bath, Emblems in Scotland: Motifs and Meanings (Brill, Leiden, 2018), pp. 97–101. Anne of Denmark gave diamond rings to the victors.Clare McManus, Women on the Renaissance Stage: Anna of Denmark and Female Masquing in the Stuart Court 1590–1618 (Manchester, 2002), p. 85. Some people were not pleased at the idea of the king and his companions dressed as the Catholic \\"Knights of the Holy Spirit\\".Thomas Thomson, History of the Kirk of Scotland by Mr David Calderwood, vol. 5 (Edinburgh, 1844), p. 346. The intended interpretation was perhaps that the knights would be seen as Protestants overcoming \\"Turks\\" who represented the Catholic church.Andrea Thomas, Glory and Honour: The Renaissance in Scotland (Edinburgh, 2013), p. 196. An event for the second day was cancelled because craftsmen could not be found to finish the costume and props, which would have included a tournament with knights riding on fantastic beasts, including a lion, elephant, unicorn, gryphon, hydra, crocodile, and a dragon, or so Fowler says.Annie Cameron, Warrender Papers, vol. 2 (SHS, Edinburgh, 1932), p. 200. ===Disguised like women=== A forerunner of this costumed event had been staged in December 1561 at the sands of Leith. The audience included Mary Queen of Scots, the English ambassador Thomas Randolph, the French ambassador Paul de Foix, and Monsieur de Moret, envoy from the Duke of Savoy. The competitors \\"running at the ring\\" included Mary's half brothers Lord John and Lord Robert, the Marquis of Elbeuf and others. There were two teams of six men, one team dressed as women, the other as exotic foreigners in strange masque garments. Lord Robert's team of \\"women\\" were the winners. Randolph wrote they were \\"dysguised and appareled th'one half lyke women, and th'other lyke strayngers, in straynge maskinge garmentes.\\"Joseph Bain, Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1898), pp. 576, 579. A previous event in France, at Amboise had involved Mary's uncle Francis, the Grand Prior, dressed as a gypsy with a baby, and the Duke of Nemours as a townsman's wife with a bunch of keys.Joseph Bain, Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1898), pp. 576, 579: Joseph Robertson, Inventaires de la Royne Descosse (Edinburgh, 1863), p. lxxvii citing Brantôme: Michael Bath, Emblems in Scotland: Motifs and Meanings (Brill, 2018), pp. 93–6. ==The baptism== Seating for VIPs in the Chapel Royal was colour coded in velvet The third day, 30 August, was the baptism proper in the Chapel Royal. Anne of Denmark does not figure in Fowler's account of the ceremony and it seems Annabell Murray, Countess of Mar took her place.Clare McManus, Women on the Renaissance Stage: Anna of Denmark and female masquing in the Stuart Court (Manchester, 2002), pp. 80–1. An ordinance for the arrangement of furnishing and seats in the chapel survives, the \\"Form and Ordering of the Chapel for the Baptism\\".Annie Cameron, Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 11 (Edinburgh, 1936), pp. 411–3, British Library Harley MS 4637 C/140, the detail of rooms and order of events in the \\"Form and Ordering\\" differs slightly from the account in A True Reportarie. The king's seat and nine seats for ambassadors were provided with cushions and desk cloths made in ten different colours of velvet by the court embroiderer William Beaton. James VI sat on a cushion of \\"incarnadin vellvot perlit with sillver\\" - pink velvet edged with silver embroidery. The place for the ambassador from Brunswick was green.Michael Pearce, 'Anna of Denmark: Fashioning a Danish Court in Scotland', Court Historian, 24:2 (2019) p. 144 citing NRS E35/13 (3) p. 22A. A vacant seat in the chapel next to the king was reserved for the French ambassador.Thomas Thomson, Memoirs of his own life by Sir James Melville of Halhill (Edinburgh, 1827), p. 412. The English ambassador, the Earl of Sussex carried the prince into the chapel in procession under a canopy. The way across the courtyard, from the \\"door of the transe of the new work\\" - the door of the palace gallery, to the chapel door was lined by the young men from Edinburgh in armour with their muskets.Thomas Thomson, History of the Kirk of Scotland by Mr David Calderwood, vol. 5 (Edinburgh, 1844), p. 343: Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 11 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 412, the palace gallery or passage to the west, which survives with its original door, was called the \\"transe\\" here printed as \\"raanse\\". The names of newly-made knights were proclaimed from the terrace of Stirling Palace and gold coins were thrown into the crowd below. In the chapel the Earl of Sussex passed the child to the Countess of Mar. Patrick Galloway gave a sermon in Scots, then David Cunningham, Bishop of Aberdeen preached in Latin, both on the text Genesis 21. Musicians sang Psalm 21, which John Calvin had related to the succession of rulers on Earth.Thomas Thomson, History of the Kirk of Scotland by Mr David Calderwood, vol. 5 (Edinburgh, 1844), p. 344. After the baptism his name was proclaimed from the window of the great hall to the crowd in the outer close and \\"trumpets blew with great noise\\". The prince was carried under the canopy back to the palace, and saluted by all the cannons in the castle. In the chapel, some English attendants washed the Earl of Sussex's hands, which was seen as a breach of etiquette.Thomas Rymer, Foedera, vol. 16 (London, 1715), p. 263. The Bishop of Aberdeen spoke again, describing the genealogy of the prince, his English descent, and also the recent history of the diplomatic relations of Scotland and alliances with the ambassadors present, and then the Chapel service concluded.Annie Cameron, Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 11 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 422 no. 340. The role of a bishop at this baptism was controversial and the Presbytery of Edinburgh had asked kirk ministers to prevent or boycott David Cunningham's participation.Thomas Thomson, History of the Kirk of Scotland by Mr David Calderwood, vol. 5 (Edinburgh, 1844), p. 346. Cunningham's second speech was problematic for its overt reference to the English succession, reminding the audience of a controversial poem by Andrew Melville, Principis Scoti Brittanorum Natalia.Annie Isabella Cameron, Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 11 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 422 no. 340, p. 431 no. 350. The guests in the chapel went back across the upper courtyard to the queen's inner hall in the Palace. There Prince Henry was knighted with a spur held by the Earl of Mar and crowned as a duke by his father. He was given the titles Great Steward of Scotland, Duke of Rothesay, Earl of Carrick, Lord of the Isles, and Baron of Renfrew. The name of the prince, \\"Henry Frederick\\" was announced from a window of the Great Hall After this several Scottish men were made knights in the queen's outer hall. The names of the newly made knights were proclaimed from the terrace at the forefront of the palace with sound of trumpets, and gold and other coins were cast amongst the people in the garden below as largesse.Thomas Rymer, Foedera, vol. 16 (London, 1715), p. 263: Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 11 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 412: William Fowler, A True Reportarie (Edinburgh, 1594). Next, Anne of Denmark received the gifts that the ambassadors had brought. The ambassadors were then escorted back to their lodgings until supper time.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 11 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 412. ===Feast and masque=== Neptune's ship was presented in a masque in the Great Hall of Stirling Castle At the supper or feast that evening at 8 o'clock, the first course was served by the new-made knights.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 11 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 412: Thomas Thomson, History of the Kirk of Scotland by Mr David Calderwood, vol. 5 (Edinburgh, 1844), p. 345. For the second course, a table laden with desserts of pâtisserie, fruit, and sugar confectionaries was drawn up the length of the Great Hall with six maidens, presumably ladies-in-waiting to Anne of Denmark, either sitting on the table or standing beside it, in masque costumes with garlands on their heads, and feathers, pearls, and jewels in their hair, representing fecundity and fertility. William Fowler called this a \\"silent comedy\\" and explained that it had been intended a real lion should haul this tableau, but on consideration this might be too frightening for the guests, or the lion might be startled with unfortunate results. Instead an African man, who Fowler called \\"the Moore\\", gave the appearance of dragging the scene along with golden chains, although in reality it was moved by \\"secret convoy\\", hidden ropes and mechanism.William Fowler, A True Reportarie (Edinburgh, 1594). The role may have represented Gawain, as he appears in the Knight of the Cart substituted for \\"Ywain\\" in Yvain, the Knight of the Lion. The exact reference intended is unclear in the evidence. The African actor may have performed in 1590 at Anne of Denmark's Entry into Edinburgh. The queen also had an African servant in her household listed as \\"the Moir\\" in 1590, who was bought clothes with her pages, but there is no further record of this man.Michael Pearce, 'Anna of Denmark: Fashioning a Danish Court in Scotland', The Court Historian, 24:2 (2019) p. 144. After this tableau was removed, a large model ship was brought into the Great Hall, or uncovered there. This was to evoke to the King's journey to Norway and Denmark in 1589 to meet Anne of Denmark, in the manner of Jason and the Argonauts, as if Neptune, the pilot of the ship, had made their marriage, despite the \\"conspiracies of witches\\". The fore-sail was painted with a compass and the North Star, the main sail with the arms of Scotland and Denmark. Thetis and Triton were also on board, with six sailors wearing shot-silk, and fourteen musicians dressed in Stewart red and yellow. The ship was accompanied by three women dressed as mermaids or sirens, as Parthenope, Ligeia, and Leucosia, who sang and mimed in time to the music. There were thirty six working brass cannons.William Fowler, A True Reportarie (Edinburgh, 1594). The ship was laden with all kinds of fish made from sugar, including herring, whiting, flounders, oysters, whelks, crabs and clams, served in Venetian glasses tinted with azure, which were distributed while Arion seated on a dolphin played his harp. Some Latin verses in praise of Anne were sung, followed by Psalm 128 in canon with musical accompaniment.Thomas Thomson, History of the Kirk of Scotland by Mr David Calderwood, vol. 5 (Edinburgh, 1844), p. 345, \\"there was sung the 128th Psalm with diverse voices and tunes, and musical instruments playing\\". Triton blew his trumpet and Neptune whistled, and then the ship sailed away, firing the rest of its guns. The ship model was kept at Stirling Castle for many years. Fowler's book gives the dimensions: > \\"Presently after the returning of the Chariot, entered a most sumpteous, > artificiall, and well proportioned ship, the length of her keele, was 18. > foot, and her bredth 8. foote: from her bottome to her highest flagge, was > 40. foot: the Sea shee stoode vpon, was 24. foot long, with bredth > convenient: her motion was so artificially devised within her self, that > none could perceive what brought her in.\\"William Fowler, A True Reportarie > (Edinburgh, 1594). James and Anne and the ambassadors went into a room in the Palace, hung with recently repaired tapestry, where there was another sugar banquet. Sugar confections and sculptures were made for the court by Jacques de Bousie, a Flemish specialist.Michael Pearce, 'Riddle's Court, Banquet & Diplomacy in 1598', History Scotland 12:4 (2012), pp. 20–7: Marguerite Wood, Extracts from the Records of the Burgh of Edinburgh, 1589–1603 (Edinburgh, 1927), p. 362. Bousie and Jeremy Bowie were paid £220 Scots for glasses to serve the desserts.Miles Kerr-Peterson & Michael Pearce, 'James VI's English Subsidy and Danish Dowry Accounts, 1588–1596', Scottish History Society Miscellany XVI (Woodbridge, 2020), p. 80. Meanwhile, the Great Hall was cleared for revels, which Fowler did not describe further. The event ended at 3 o'clock in the morning. Over the next few days James gave gifts to the ambassadors. In 1610 the masque Tethys' Festival at the investiture of Prince Henry as Prince of Wales also had a maritime theme, Anne of Denmark played a sea goddess Tethys in Milford Haven harbour, while her ladies-in-waiting personified rivers. The banquet at the King James's baptism in December 1566 at Stirling Castle had also involved food on moving stages, with dancing choreographed by Bastian Pagez. ==Ambassadors and diplomatic gift-giving== Anne of Denmark accepted gifts from the ambassadors in a ceremony held in her audience chamber in the palace. Robert Radclyffe, 5th Earl of Sussex was the ambassador from England. His companions in Scotland were Lord Wharton, Sir Henry Bromley of Holt, Hugh Portman, Henry Guildford, Oliver Cromwell, Thomas Monson, Henry Clare, Edward Greville, Nicholas Sanderson, Edward Gorges, and William Jeffson, with Richard Coningsby and Mr. Rolles. Robert Bowes, the English ambassador in ordinary in Scotland and his wife Eleanor Musgrove also attended. The baptism was delayed until this party arrived at Stirling Castle.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 11 (Edinburgh, 1936), pp. 418, 422–3, 439. They came through Newcastle upon Tyne where Sussex left his coach, and they were given presents of sugar- loaves, claret, and sack.Richard Welford, History of Gateshead and Newcastle, vol. 3 (London, 1890), pp. 93–4. Henry Bromley of Holt, Worcestershire, is known to have employed an African servant, Henry Jetto, at his home, Holt Castle.Miranda Kaufmann, Black Tudors (london, 2017), pp. 110, 239. Sussex had audiences with James VI of Scotland and Anne of Denmark on 29 August. During the baptism ceremony Sussex carried the child from his bedchamber for the day in the queen's inner hall in the Palace to the Chapel Royal, closely supervised by the Countess of Mar. The only Englishmen in the chapel during the ceremony were Sussex, Henry Bromley, and Lord Wharton.Thomas Rymer, Foedera, vol. 16 (London, 1715), p. 264. After discussions with James about Catholics and rebels in Scotland, Sussex left Scotland on 12 September and was injured by a horse near Northallerton on 14 September.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 11 (Edinburgh, 1936), pp. 418, 422–3, 439. Sir James Melville of Halhill, a gentleman in the queen's household, described the audience with Anne of Denmark for the ambassadors in the palace of Stirling Castle, when she received their gifts. Melville stood behind the queen, beside a table placed especially in the middle of the chamber for the ceremony. According to the \\"Form and Ordering\\" this ceremony took place after the making of knights, before the feast and masque.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 11 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 412. Melville wrote that Anne of Denmark spoke to the English, the Danish, and the German ambassadors from Mecklenberg and Brunswick in their own languages, but asked him to interpret her speech into French for the Dutch ambassadors, even though her own French was \\"seemly\\". The ambassadors who gave gifts of jewelry handed them to the queen, then she passed them to Melville, who returned them to their decorative cases and laid them on the table.Thomas Thomson, Memoirs of his own life by Sir James Melville of Halhill (Edinburgh, 1827), pp. 412–3. There was an element of competition in this gift-giving, and on Elizabeth's part an effort to assert her relationship to the king of Scotland and the matter of the English succession.Felicity Heal, 'Royal Gifts and Gift Exchange in Anglo-Scottish Politics', in Steve Boardman, Julian Goodare, Kings, Lords and Men in Scotland and Britain 1300–1625, Essays in Honour of Jenny Wormald (Edinburgh, 2014), p. 292. The Earl of Sussex wrote that the \\"Scots, Danes, Germans and Dutchmen\\" admired the gifts as \\"the most stately presents that ever they saw\\".Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 11 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 423. ===Gifts for a prince=== The Earl of Sussex brought gifts of plate from Elizabeth including some older pieces, noted by Melville as \\"cunningly wrought\\" and as \\"ancient\\" in a Scottish inventory.The detailed Scottish inventory is in the British Library Add MS 33531 (The Hopetoun manuscript, see transcript NRS RH2/2/16 p. 218): A brief note of the gifts appears in an armorial Lambeth Palace Library MS 316 f.3r. A gold cup with marguerite pearls and rubies about the foot and sapphires may have belonged to Margaret of Anjou (1430–1482) or Margaret Tudor (1489–1541). A cup decorated with snakes, newts, frogs coloured in enamels with a stag hunt on the cover had been admired by Lupold von Wedel in 1584 in the Tower of London. It was probably German, and had been bought for Elizabeth from Richard Martin.A. J. Collins, Jewels and Plate of Queen Elizabeth (London, 1955), pp. 281, 404, 487, 578. The Danish ambassadors were Steen Bille (1565–1629) and Christian Barnekow (1556–1612). It had been rumoured that Manderup Parsberg, one of the four Regents of Denmark would attend.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 11 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 363. On 10 October 1589 Bille had brought a letter from Anne of Denmark to James VI explaining that she had given up trying to sail Scotland after five failed attempts.William Boyd, Henry Meikle, Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), pp. 166–8: Miles Kerr-Peterson & Michael Pearce, 'James VI's English Subsidy and Danish Dowry Accounts, 1588–1596', Scottish History Society Miscellany XVI (Woodbridge, 2020), pp. 1, 93–4. Now Bille and Barnekow brought gold chains each worth 500 French crowns for the queen and prince.Foedera, vol. 16 (London, 1715), p. 263: The form and the stones of these necklaces and their pendants are detailed in the Scottish inventory, British Library Add MS 33531/225. There was also an ambassador, Adam Crusius or Crause of Borchfelda (Bortfeld),A eulogy mentions his negotiations in Scotland, Johannes Caselius, Krosiades sive aulae magister (Helmstadt, 1609), sig. k: Honori exequiarum Magni & generosi viri, dn. Adami Crausen In Borchfelda (Helmstadt, 1608), sig. A3, \\"Ablegabat eum tum quoque in Scotiam princeps, cuius nomine sacrae solemnitate praesto esset: eoque negotio peracto saluus rediit.\\" from the Duke of Brunswick and Joachim von Bassewitz from Anne's grandfather, the Duke of Mecklenberg.Martin Wiggins & Catherine Richardson, British Drama 1533–1642: A Catalogue: 1590–1597, vol. 3 (Oxford, 2013), p. 247. Crusius presented a chain of gold pea-pods enameled with green, with a locket containing a miniature portrait of the Duke of Brunswick and the story of the Diana and Actaeon on the lid, and a chain made of gold whelk shells for Anne of Denmark. Bassewitz brought a locket or pendant depicting the Annunciation and a chain or necklace for the queen made up of rubies, chrysolites, and hyacinths, which he told the English diplomats represented the roses of York and Lancaster. It was suitable for Anne of Denmark to wear on the front of gown made in the French fashion, now current.Thomas Rymer, Foedera, vol. 16 (London, 1715), pp. 264 from British Library Cotton Caligula D II, see also BL Add MS 33531. Her court jeweler, Jacob Kroger, had been executed for theft in June.Mary Anne Everett Green, Calendar State Papers Domestic, Addenda 1580–1625 (London, 1872), p. 368. Some of the jewels had been obtained by Francis Stewart, 5th Earl of Bothwell who returned them to try to win royal favour. Bassewitz attempted to speak with Robert Bowes on Bothwell's behalf.Annie Cameron, Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 11 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 414. Walraven III van Brederode (1547–1614) and Jacob Valke, treasurer of Zeeland were the ambassadors from the Dutch Republic or United Provinces. They presented two large gold cups and a letter in a gold box giving Prince Henry a yearly pension of 5,000 \\"Gelderlings\\" or \\"Gudlenes\\".Thomas Rymer, Foedera, vol. 16 (London, 1715), p. 264: Thomas Thomson, The Historie and Life of King James the Sext (Edinburgh, 1825), p. 335–7. James Melville of Halhill was impressed by the weight of the cups, describing the \\"great cups of massive gold, two in special, which were enough for me to lift and set down again on the said table\\".Thomas Thomson, Memoirs of his own life by Sir James Melville of Halhill (Edinburgh, 1827), p. 413. James VI gave the ambassadors gifts in the days after the baptism. Brederode and Valke received gold chains worth 500 crowns each, Christian Bernekow and Steen Bille had gold chains worth 400 crowns, chains for Adam Crusius and Joachim Bassewitz cost 300 crowns. The Earl of Sussex was given a set of silver-gilt plates, the metal worth £4,800 Scots and making them cost £600.Miles Kerr-Peterson & Michael Pearce, 'James VI's English Subsidy and Danish Dowry Accounts, 1588–1596', Scottish History Society Miscellany XVI (Woodbridge, 2020), pp. 77–8, 87. The ambassadors' departure in three great ships with a salvo of 60 cannon shots was noted by William Fowler. However, the representatives of the \\"States of Flanders\\", Brederode and Valke, traveled from the Baptism to Berwick upon Tweed where they were entertained by John Carey on 18 September, and on to Newcastle upon Tyne where they were welcomed with lavish civic festivities.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 11 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 418: Border Papers, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1894), p. 546 no. 979. They were treated to a banquet including baked rabbit, fish, and swan, a barrel of London beer, and sugar confectionaries, to the accompaniment of music by the town's waits.Richard Welford, History of Gateshead and Newcastle, vol. 3 (London, 1890), pp. 91–3. ===Drama, diplomacy, rivalry, and etiquette=== Five years earlier, Queen Elizabeth had planned a masque for her ambassador to present at the arrival of Anne of Denmark in Scotland in September 1589. Anne however was forced to stay in Norway by accidents and bad weather, the circumstances which gave rise to Fowler mentioning thanksgiving for deliverance from witchcraft. The ambassador's masque would have comprised; six dancers wearing swords or falchions with helmets dressed with feather plumes, presumably representing classical warriors; six masked torchbearers with hats with feathers, their costumes party-coloured in the Stewart colours red and yellow; four speaking parts wearing wigs and flower chaplets. Only the account for making the costumes is known, and the subject of the masque was not recorded.Henry Morley, Masques and Entertainments by Ben Jonson (London, 1890), pp. xii-xiii: James Robinson Planche, A Cyclopedia Of Costume, vol. 2 (London, 1879), p. 394: John Payne Collier, Annals of the Stage, vol. 1 (London, 1831), pp. 270–1, citing British Library Lansdowne MS 59. At the same time, James VI had sent Roger Aston to Lord Scrope at Carlisle for actors from the Queen's Players who were at Knowsley Hall to perform in Edinburgh. These players may have performed for the Earl of Bothwell after James VI had sailed for Norway.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 157, 179, BL Egerton MS 2,598/82 & BL Cotton Caligula D. I/408: Anna Jean Mill, Medieval Plays in Scotland (Edinburgh, 1927), p. 299: Helen Ostovich, Holger Schott Syme, Andrew Griffin, Locating the Queen's Men, 1583–1603 (Routledge, 2009), p. 54, locates the Queen's Men at Knowsley on 12–13 September 1589, other authors suggest 5–6 September. Some English players or comedians were paid in February 1594, and in March 1595 a recent visit to Scotland by the actor Lawrence Fletcher was mentioned by George Nicholson. There is no direct evidence to connect Fletcher and these English players with the events at Stirling in August 1594. James VI was evidently fond of Fletcher, an actor who might have been \\"hanged for his cause.\\"Peter Roberts, 'The Business of Playing and the Patronage of Players', Ralph Anthony Houlbrooke, James VI and I: Ideas, Authority, and Government (Ashgate, 2006), p. 85: James Dibdin, The Annals of the Edinburgh Stage (Edinburgh, 1888), p. 20–21: John Duncan Mackie, Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1597–1603, 13:1 (Edinburgh, 1969), p. 555. It was usual for the king to appoint companions for ambassadors in Scotland to entertain and assist them, and James VI wrote to Sir John Gordon of Pitlurg in June 1594 offering him this role.Miscellany of the Spalding Club, 1 (Aberdeen, 1841), p. 8. James Melville of Halhill described some tensions between the ambassadors in the summer of 1594. He said two of the Scottish envoys sent with invitations were unsuitable. Sir William Keith of Delny could not speak French, Latin, or Flemish, and the laird of Easter Wemyss was chosen only because he happened to be travelling to London and Paris on his own business. Melville states that Peter Young went to Denmark, Brunswick, and Mecklenberg, and was rewarded with gifts of three gold chains, but the dukes felt they would have been better honoured by a separate ambassador to each of them. Easter Wemyss received no rewards, because he was a messenger and did not have the status of an ambassador. Melville claimed that Elizabeth was more enthusiastic to be represented at the event when she learned that Henry IV of France was not sending an ambassador, despite the invitation delivered by the laird of Wemyss.Thomas Thomson, Memoirs of his own life by Sir James Melville of Halhill (Edinburgh, 1827), p. 411. The Danish ambassadors and the ambassadors from the two German dukes had arrived in Leith on 11 and 12 July.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 11 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 376. Melville was appointed to greet them, but he could not persuade them to ride up to Holyrood Palace together in the same convoy and instead had to organise two processions. As the day of the masque and baptism was postponed, Melville had to entertain the ambassadors in Edinburgh, with his brothers Andrew Melville of Garvock and William Melville Commendator of Tungland.Thomas Thomson, Memoirs of his own life by Sir James Melville of Halhill (Edinburgh, 1827), pp. 410–413. Robert Bowes said the ambassadors were entertained by various lairds of Lothian in turn, at the king's request. John Colville wrote that the day after the ambassadors arrived Anne of Denmark took the ferry to Fife and went to Falkland Palace to avoid them because she felt her accommodation at Holyroodhouse was not up to scratch. When she had an audience with them they discussed a plan for her younger sister Augusta of Denmark to marry Maurice, Prince of Orange, but nothing came of it.Annie Cameron, Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 11 (Edinburgh, 1936), pp. 377, 385, 404. Henry IV of France sent a polite letter of thanks for the invitation on 1 October 1594 when the laird of Easter Wemyss returned from Paris.Annie I. Cameron, Warrender Papers, vol. 2 (SHS, Edinburgh, 1932), pp. 267–8. ==Paying the bills== James VI set a tax of £100,000 (Scots) for the expenses. Textiles and costumes for the event were bought using Anne's dowry of £100,000 (Scots) which had been in the safekeeping of various towns. Costumes for the women of Queen Anne's household were bought using £4000 held at St Andrews and Anstruther, while £3000 from Perth paid for upholstery and repairs to tapestry.Register of the Privy Council, vol. 5 (Edinburgh, 1882), pp. 116, 131–2, 151–2, 153–4, for some details of expenditure see National Records of Scotland E35/13. The textile merchant and financier Robert Jousie received £1000 from Aberdeen.John Stuart, Extracts Council Register of Aberdeen: 1570–1625, vol. 2 (Aberdeen, 1848), pp. 94–99. According to the author of the Historie and Life of King James the Sext the dowry money had been lodged with the towns to give the queen an annual income, and James was urged to spent it by corrupt advisors to offset his expenditure on \\"unnecessary\\" armed troops.Thomas Thomson, The Historie and Life of King James the Sext (Edinburgh, 1825), p. 315. James VI also wrote letters to the lairds, asking them to send \\"quick stuff\\", live animals especially deer and wild fowl, such as they \\"may have in readiness and spare\\" as gifts.HMC 3rd Report: Wemyss Castle (London, 1872), p. 422. Some items, like the transport of the unused lion to from Holyroodhouse to Stirling, and clothes for James's former nurse Helen Littil and her daughters Grissel and Sarah Gray, were paid for through the usual Royal Treasurer's account.Letters to King James the Sixth from the Queen etc (Edinburgh, 1835), Appendix p. lxi, citing NRS E21/70 Other items, like the gifts given to ambassadors and a piece of alabaster used in the chapel, came from subsidy money sent by Queen Elizabeth and managed by the jeweller and financier Thomas Foulis.Henry Paton, Accounts of the Masters of Work for building and repairing Royal Palaces and Castles, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1957), p. 314 citing NRS E30/15/1: Michael Lynch, 'Court Ceremony and Ritual', in Julian Goodare & Michael Lynch, The Reign of James VI (East Linton, 2000), p. 90 fn. 3 citing NRS E30/14 and E30/15/2. In September 1594 James VI gave Foulis the gold cups presented by the Dutch ambassadors to melt down and coin to cover some of his debt.David Masson, Register of the Privy Council, vol. 5 (Edinburgh, 1882), p. 167. No detailed records of making the masque costumes described by Fowler, or building the Chapel Royal survive. ==Stirling Castle today== The Chapel Royal was built for the baptism in Italianate style with proportions evoking the Temple of Solomon to the designs of William Schaw The buildings that formed the backdrop for the events of the baptism are still intact with few external changes since 1594. The interiors of the Great Hall, Chapel Royal, and Palace have been returned to their original layout and proportions, and subdivisions made during the later use of the castle as army barracks removed. The rooms in the palace were restored in 2010.John G. Harrison, Rebirth of a Palace: The Royal Court at Stirling Castle (Historic Scotland, 2011). Painted decoration surviving in the Chapel Royal by Valentine Jenkin mostly dates from 1629 and shadow traces of paintwork from 1594 can be seen on the exterior around the windows.Ian Campbell and Aonghus MacKechnie, 'The 'Great Temple of Solomon' at Stirling Castle', Architectural History, vol. 54 (2011), pp. 95, 98–9. No furnishings from 1594 are known to survive, except a plain oak pulpit possibly used by Patrick Galloway and David Cunningham, which is stored by Historic Environment Scotland.Ian Campbell and Aonghus MacKechnie, 'The 'Great Temple of Solomon' at Stirling Castle', Architectural History, vol. 54 (2011), 103. The architectural spaces of August 1594 can still be explored and experienced by visitors today. The Chapel Royal was purpose-built in 1594 under the direction of William Schaw, who was Master of Work to the king and the queen, and an administrator of the queen's landed income. Some of the timber was selected on the Shore of Leith by the king's carpenter James Murray, elder.Marguerite Wood, Extracts from the Records of the Burgh of Edinburgh: 1589–1603 (Edinburgh, 1927), p. 113. The building has an central triumphal arch as an entrance, flanked by Italianate windows, and can be described as the first Renaissance style church in Britain.Ian Campbell and Aonghus MacKechnie, 'The 'Great Temple of Solomon' at Stirling Castle', Architectural History, vol. 54 (2011), pp. 91, 103. The north façade is featureless. An older chapel on the site was judged inadequate for its bad proportions by a previous Master of Work Robert Drummond of Carnock in May 1583.Accounts of the Masters of Work, vol.1, (Edinburgh, 1957), pp. 310–11. Ian Campbell and Aonghus MacKechnie argue that the proportions of the new building and a partition or barrier in the original interior mentioned by William Fowler matched ratios in the Bible for the measurements of the Temple of Solomon.Ian Campbell and Aonghus MacKechnie, 'The 'Great Temple of Solomon' at Stirling Castle', Architectural History, vol. 54 (2011), pp. 92, 95, 105–9. James VI had been compared to Solomon by his courtiers and poets, and while the chapel was being built John Colville described it in a letter as \\"the great Temple of Solomon\\".Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 11 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 377. However, this connection was not developed in William Fowler's description of the baptism pageant. Campbell and MacKechnie propose that the physical embodiment of the Temple in the architecture, rather than the allusion to kingship made by Colville, was a secret kept by the masons.Ian Campbell and Aonghus MacKechnie, 'The 'Great Temple of Solomon' at Stirling Castle', Architectural History, vol. 54 (2011), pp. 110–2. ==The legacy for historians== The events of the baptism were intended to convey a cluster of meanings; the genealogy of Prince Henry, the legitimacy of the Scottish succession to the crown of England, the wealth of Scotland, its faith, the difficulties that James VI and Anne of Denmark faced crossing the sea as an epic battle against witchcraft, and Scotland's presence on the international stage. Modern historians continue to debate these themes, and also with a focus on the role of Anne, or Anna of Denmark as an agent in these events, or debate the role of the African actor, and the costumed performances. The references to this article, external links, and bibliography are intended as a guide to the modern dialogue concerning these issues. ==ReferencesBibliography=== * William Fowler, A True Reportarie (Robert Waldegrave, Edinburgh, 1594), text Early English Books Online. * William Fowler, A True Reportarie (Robert Waldegrave, Edinburgh, 1594), text Oxford text creation partnership. * Henry Meikle, John Craigie, James Purves, The Works of William Fowler: Secretary to Queen Anne, Wife of James VI, vol. 2 (STS: Edinburgh, 1940), pp. 165–195, A True Reportarie (Edinburgh, 1594) and William Fowler's 'Relation of the pastyme and devyces used at the baptisme', text from National Records of Scotland GD1/371/1. * Elizabeth Goldring, Faith Eales, Elizabeth Clarke, Jayne Elisabeth Archer, John Nichols's The Progresses and Public Processions of Queen Elizabeth: 1579 to 1595, vol. 3 (Oxford, 2014), pp. 742–765, text of A True Reportarie (Edinburgh, 1594) edited by Michael Ullyot. * John Nichols, The progresses and public processions of Queen Elizabeth, vol. 3 (London, 1823), pp. 353–369, adapted from A True Reportarie (Peter Short: London, 1594). * A poem by Andrew Melville on the birth of Prince Henry, 'Principis Scoto-Britannorum natalia' (1594), Bridging the Continental Divide, University of Glasgow. * Thomas Rymer, Foedera, vol. 16 (London, 1715), pp. 263–4, text from British Library Cotton Caligula D II. * Annie I.

Originally, wolves occurred in Eurasia above the 12th parallel north and in North America above the 15th parallel north. However, deliberate human persecution has reduced the species' range to about one-third, because of livestock predation and fear of wolf attacks on humans. The species is now extirpated (made locally extinct) in much of Western Europe, in Mexico, and much of the United States. In modern history, the gray wolf occurs mostly in wilderness and remote areas, particularly in Canada, Alaska and the Northern United States, Europe and Asia from about the 75th parallel north to the 12th parallel north. Wolf population declines have been arrested since the 1970s, and have fostered recolonization and reintroduction in parts of its former range, due to legal protection, changes in land-use and rural human population shifts to cities. Competition with humans for livestock and game species, concerns over the danger posed by wolves to people, and habitat fragmentation pose a continued threat to the species. Despite these threats, because of the gray wolf's relatively widespread range and stable population, it is classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. == Europe  Decline === Wolf populations strongly declined across Europe during the 18th and 19th centuries largely due to human persecution, and by the End of World War II in Europe they had been extirpated from all of Central Europe and almost all of Northern Europe. The extirpation of Northern Europe's wolves first became an organized effort during the Middle Ages, and continued until the late 19th century. In England, wolf eradication was enforced by legislation, and the last wolf was killed in the early 16th century during the reign of Henry VII (reigned 1485-1509). Wolves lasted longer in Scotland, where they sheltered in vast tracts of forest, which were subsequently burned down. Wolves managed to survive in the forests of Braemar and Sutherland until 1684. The extirpation of wolves in Ireland followed a similar course, with the last wolf believed to have been killed in 1786. A wolf bounty was introduced in Sweden in 1647, after the extirpation of moose and reindeer forced wolves to feed on livestock. The Sami extirpated wolves in northern Sweden in organized drives. By 1960, few wolves remained in Sweden, because of the use of snowmobiles in hunting them, with the last specimen being killed in 1966. The gray wolf was extirpated in Denmark in 1772 and Norway's last wolf was killed in 1973. The species was decimated in 20th century Finland, despite regular dispersals from Russia. The gray wolf was only present in the eastern and northern parts of Finland by 1900, though its numbers increased after World War II. In Central Europe, wolves were dramatically reduced in number during the early 19th century, because of organized hunts and reductions in ungulate populations. In Bavaria, the last wolf was killed in 1847, and had disappeared from the Rhine regions by 1899. In Switzerland, wolves were extirpated in the 20th century; they are naturally coming back from Italy since the 1990s.Heinz Staffelbach, Manuel des Alpes suisses. Flore, faune, roches et météorologie , Rossolis, 2009 (). Also available in German: Heinz Staffelbach, Handbuch Schweizer Alpen. Pflanzen, Tiere, Gesteine und Wetter, Haupt Verlag, 2008 (). In 1934, Nazi Germany became the first state in modern history to place the wolf under protection, though the species was already extirpated in Germany at this point.Sax, Boria (2000). Animals in the Third Reich: Pets, Scapegoats, and the Holocaust, Continuum International Publishing Group, p. 75, The last free-living wolf to be killed on the soil of present-day Germany before 1945 was the so-called \\"Tiger of Sabrodt\\", which was shot near Hoyerswerda, Lusatia (then Lower Silesia) in 1904. Today, wolves have returned to the area.Verbreitung in Deutschland at Wolf Region Lausitz . Retrieved October 12, 2013 Wolf hunting in France was first institutionalized by Charlemagne between 800–813, when he established the louveterie, a special corps of wolf hunters. The louveterie was abolished after the French Revolution in 1789, but was reestablished in 1814. In 1883, up to 1,386 wolves were killed, with many more by poison. Last wolf to be killed in central Finland (Karstula, 1911) In Eastern Europe, some wolves remained because of the area's contiguity with Asia and its large forested areas. However, Eastern European wolf populations were reduced to very low numbers by the late 19th century. Wolves were extirpated in Slovakia during the first decade of the 20th century and, by the mid-20th century, could only be found in a few forested areas in eastern Poland. Wolves in the eastern Balkans benefitted from the region's contiguity with the former Soviet Union and large areas of plains, mountains and farmlands. Wolves in Hungary occurred in only half the country around the start of the 20th century, and were largely restricted to the Carpathian Basin. Wolf populations in Romania remained largely substantial, with an average of 2,800 wolves being killed annually out of a population of 4,600 from 1955–1965. An all-time low was reached in 1967, when the population was reduced to 1,550 animals. The extirpation of wolves in Bulgaria was relatively recent, as a previous population of about 1,000 animals in 1955 was reduced to about 100–200 in 1964. In Greece, the species disappeared from the southern Peloponnese in 1930. Despite periods of intense hunting during the 18th century, wolves never disappeared in the western Balkans, from Albania to the former Yugoslavia. Organized persecution of wolves began in Yugoslavia in 1923, with the setting up of the Wolf Extermination Committee (WEC) in Kocevje, Slovenia. The WEC was successful in reducing wolf numbers in the Dinaric Alps. In Southern Europe, some wolves remained because of greater cultural tolerance of the species. Wolf populations only began declining in the Iberian Peninsula in the early 19th century, and was reduced by a half of its original size by 1900. Wolf bounties were regularly paid in Italy as late as 1950. Wolves were extirpated in the Alps by 1800, and numbered only 100 by 1973, inhabiting only 3–5% of their former Italian range. === Recovery === Present range of Canis lupus subspecies in Eurasia European authors use another taxonomie and names for the subspecies The recovery of European wolf populations began after the 1950s, when traditional pastoral and rural economies declined and thus removed the need to heavily persecute wolves. By the 1980s, small and isolated wolf populations expanded in the wake of decreased human density in rural areas and the recovery of wild prey populations. The gray wolf has been fully protected in Italy since 1976, and now holds a population of over 1,269–1,800. Italian wolves entered France's Mercantour National Park in 1993, and at least fifty wolves were discovered in the western Alps in 2000. By 2013 the 250 wolves in the Western Alps imposed a significant burden on traditional sheep and goat husbandry with a loss of over 5,000 animals in 2012. There are approximately 2,000 wolves inhabiting the Iberian Peninsula, of which 150 reside in northeastern Portugal. In Spain, the species occurs in Galicia, Leon, and Asturias. Although hundreds of Iberian wolves are illegally killed annually, the population has expanded south across the river Duero and east to the Asturias and Pyrenees Mountains. Eurasian wolf in Bavarian Forest National Park, Germany In 1978, wolves began recolonising central Sweden after a 12-year absence, and have since expanded into southern Norway. As of 2020, the total number of Swedish and Norwegian wolves is estimated to be 450. The gray wolf is protected in Sweden but with an 12% annual rate of poaching, and partially controlled in Norway. The Scandinavian wolf populations owe their continued existence to neighbouring Finland's contiguity with the Republic of Karelia, which houses a large population of wolves. Wolves in Finland are protected only in the southern third of the country, and can be hunted in other areas during specific seasons, though poaching remains common, with 90% of young wolf deaths being due to human predation, and the number of wolves killed exceeds the number of hunting licenses, in some areas by a factor of two. Furthermore, the decline in the moose populations has reduced the wolf's food supply.Juha Kauppinen (April 2008). \\"Susien määrä yllättäen vähentynyt\\", Suomen Luonto .\\"SS: Kuolleissa susissa vanhoja hauleja\\", Iltalehti , March 19, 2013. Since 2011, the Netherlands, Belgium and Denmark have also reported wolf sightings presumably by natural migration from adjacent countries.\\"The wolf returns: Call of the wild\\", The Economist, (December 22, 2012)\\"Det var en ulv\\" , (in Danish) Danish Nature Agency, (December 7, 2012) In 2016, a female wolf tracked 550 kilometers from a region southwest of Berlin to settle in Jutland, Denmark where male wolves had been reported in 2012 for the first time in 200 years. Wolves have also commenced breeding in Lower Austria's Waldviertel region for the first time in over 130 years. Wolf populations in Poland have increased to about 800–900 individuals since being classified as a game species in 1976. Poland plays a fundamental role in providing routes of expansion into neighbouring Central European countries. In the east, its range overlaps with populations in Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine, and Slovakia. A population in western Poland expanded into eastern Germany and in 2000 the first pups were born on German territory. In 2012, an estimated 14 wolf packs were living in Germany (mostly in the east and north) and a pack with pups has been sighted within 15 miles of Berlin; the number increased to 46 packs in 2016. The gray wolf is protected in Slovakia, though an exception is made for wolves killing livestock. A few Slovakian wolves disperse into the Czech Republic, where they are afforded full protection. Wolves in Slovakia, Ukraine and Croatia may disperse into Hungary, where the lack of cover hinders the buildup of an autonomous population. Although wolves have special status in Hungary, they may be hunted with a year-round permit if they cause problems. Romania has a large population of wolves, numbering 2,500 animals. The wolf has been a protected animal in Romania since 1996, although the law is not enforced. The number of wolves in Albania and North Macedonia is largely unknown, despite the importance the two countries have in linking wolf populations from Greece to those of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia. Although protected, sometimes wolves are still illegally killed in Greece, and their future is uncertain. Wolf numbers have declined in Bosnia and Herzegovina since 1986, while the species is fully protected in neighbouring Croatia and Slovenia. Although wolf-dog hybridization in Europe has raised concern among conservation groups fearing for the gray wolf's purity, genetic tests show that introgression of dog genes into European gray wolf populations does not pose a significant threat. Also, as wolf and dog mating seasons do not fully coincide, the likelihood of wild wolves and dogs mating and producing surviving offspring is small. == Asia  Historical range and decline === Monument to the last Japanese wolf, Nara Prefecture, Japan During the 19th century, gray wolves were widespread in many parts of the Holy Land east and west of the Jordan River. However, they decreased considerably in number between 1964 and 1980, largely because of persecution by farmers.Qumsiyeh, Mazin B. (1996). Mammals of the Holy Land. Texas Tech University Press, pp. 146–148, The species was not considered common in northern and central Saudi Arabia during the 19th century, with most early publications citing sources which involved animals either from southwestern Asir, northern rocky areas bordering Jordan, or areas surrounding Riyadh. The gray wolf's range in the Soviet Union encompassed nearly the entire territory of the country, being absent only on the Solovetsky Islands, Franz-Josef Land, Severnaya Zemlya, and the Karagin, Commander and Shantar Islands. The species was extirpated twice in Crimea, once after the Russian Civil War, and again after World War II. Following the two world wars the Soviet wolf populations peaked twice, with 30,000 wolves being harvested annually out of a population of 200,000 during the 1940s, and 40,000–50,000 harvested during peak years. Soviet wolf populations reached a low around 1970, disappearing over much of European Russia. The population increased again by 1980 to about 75,000, with 32,000 being killed in 1979. Wolf populations in northern Inner Mongolia declined during the 1940s, primarily because of poaching of gazelles, the wolf's main prey. In British-ruled India, wolves were heavily persecuted because of their attacks on sheep, goats and children. In 1876, 2,825 wolves were bountied in the North-Western Provinces (NWP) and Bihar. By the 1920s, wolf eradication remained a priority in the NWP and Awadh. Overall, over 100,000 wolves were killed for bounties in British India between 1871 and 1916.Knight, John (2004). Wildlife in Asia: Cultural Perspectives, Psychology Press, pp. 219–221, Wolves in Japan were extirpated during the Meiji restoration period, in a campaign known as ōkami no kujo. The wolf was deemed a threat to ranching, which the Meiji government promoted at the time, and targeted via a bounty system and a direct chemical poisoning campaign inspired by the similar contemporary American campaign. The last Japanese wolf was a male killed on January 23, 1905 near Washikaguchi (now called Higashi Yoshiro). The now-extirpated Japanese wolves were descended from large Siberian wolves, which colonized the Korean Peninsula and Japan, before it separated from mainland Asia, 20,000 years ago during the Pleistocene. During the Holocene, the Tsugaru Strait widened and isolated Honshu from Hokkaido, thus causing climatic changes leading to the extinction of most large-bodied ungulates inhabiting the archipelago. Japanese wolves likely underwent a process of island dwarfism 7,000–13,000 years ago in response to these climatological and ecological pressures. C. l. hattai (formerly native to Hokkaidō) was significantly larger than its southern cousin C. l. hodophilax, as it inhabited higher elevations and had access to larger prey, as well as a continuing genetic interaction with dispersing wolves from Siberia. Gray wolves had a wide historic range in China encompassing nearly all of mainland China, including southern China.Lu WANG, Ya-Ping MA, Qi-Jun ZHOU, Ya-Ping ZHANG, Peter SAVOLAIMEN, Guo-Dong WANG. 2016. The geographical distribution of grey wolves (Canis lupus) in China: a systematic review[J]. Zoological Research, 37(6): 317-328. A systematic review by Wang et al. in 2016, found museum specimens from wolves from across China, in 13 provinces, including several in southern China - two specimens sampled from two southern Chinese provinces (Zhejiang and Fujian) in 1974, and one from southern Yunnan in 1985. This study also reviewed more than 100 articles and found modern, recent records of gray wolves in every continental province of China between 1964 and the present except for three provinces - Tianjin, Jiangsu, and Fujian. Wolves were recorded in South China (in Yunnan province) as late as 2011, and in the two southernmost provinces (Guangdong and Guangxi) in the year of 2000. From these findings, the researchers concluded that wolves are still present across all parts of continental China. === Modern range === Gray wolf near Ardahan, Turkey. There is little reliable data on the status of wolves in the Middle East, save for those in Israel and Saudi Arabia, though their numbers appear to be stable, and are likely to remain so. Throughout the Middle East, the species is only protected in Israel. Elsewhere, it can be hunted year-round by Bedouins. Israel's conservation policies and effective law enforcement maintain a moderately sized wolf population, which radiates into neighbouring countries, while Saudi Arabia has vast tracts of desert, where about 300–600 wolves live undisturbed. The wolf survives throughout most of its historical range in Saudi Arabia, probably because of a lack of pastoralism and abundant human waste. Turkey may play an important role in maintaining wolves in the region, because of its contiguity with Central Asia. Although Turkish wolves have no legal protection, they may number about 7,000 individuals. The mountains of Turkey have served as a refuge for the few wolves remaining in Syria. A small wolf population occurs in the Golan Heights, and is well protected by the military activities there. Wolves living in the southern Negev desert are contiguous with populations living in the Egyptian Sinai and Jordan. Indian wolf at Velavadar (Blackbuck National Park, Gujarat) The northern regions of Afghanistan and Pakistan are important strongholds for the wolf. It has been estimated that there are about 300 wolves in approximately of Jammu and Kashmir in northern India, and 50 more in Himachal Pradesh. Overall, India supports about 800–3,000 wolves, scattered among several remnant populations. Although protected since 1972, Indian wolves are classed as endangered, with many populations lingering in low numbers or living in areas increasingly used by humans. Little is known of current wolf populations in Iran, which occurred throughout the country in low densities during the mid-1970s. Although present in Nepal and Bhutan, there is no information on wolves occurring there. Wolf populations throughout Northern and Central Asia are largely unknown, but are estimated in the hundreds of thousands based on annual harvests. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, continent-wide culling of wolves has ceased, and wolf populations have increased to about 25,000–30,000 animals throughout the former Soviet Union. In China and Mongolia, wolves are only protected in reserves. Mongolian populations have been estimated at 10,000–30,000, while the status of wolves in China is more fragmentary. The north has a declining population of an estimated 400 wolves, while Xinjiang and Tibet hold about 10,000 and 2,000 respectively. In 2008, an authoritative reference stated that the gray wolf could be found across mainland China. In 2017, a comprehensive study found that the gray wolf was present across all of mainland China, both in the past and today. It exists in southern China, which refutes claims made by some researchers in the Western world that the wolf had never existed in southern China. In 2019, a genomic study on the wolves of China included museum specimens of wolves from southern China that were collected between 1963-1988. The wolves in the study formed 3 clades: north Asian wolves that included those from northern China and eastern Russia, Himalayan wolves from the Tibetan Plateau, and a unique population from southern China. One specimen from Zhejiang province in eastern China shared gene flow with the wolves from southern China, however its genome was 12-14 percent admixed with a canid that may be the dhole or an unknown canid that predates the genetic divergence of the dhole. The wolf population from southern China is believed to be still existing in that region. == North America == gray wolf subspecies in North America gray wolf killed in Montana, 1928. Before they were extirpated around 1930, Montana's wolves could be very large. Wolves recolonized the state from Canada beginning in the 1970s. === Historical range and decline === Originally, the gray wolf occupied all of North America north of about 20°N. It occurred all over the mainland, save for the southeastern United States, California west of the Sierra Nevada, and the tropical and subtropical areas of Mexico. Large continental islands occupied by wolves included Newfoundland, Vancouver Island, the southeastern Alaskan islands, and throughout the Arctic Archipelago and Greenland. While Lohr and Ballard postulated that the gray wolf had never been present on Prince Edward Island, analysis of references to the island's native fauna in unpublished and published historical records has found that gray wolves were resident there at the time of the first French settlement in 1720. In his November 6, 1721 letter to the French Minister of the Marine, Louis Denys de La Ronde reported that the island was home to wolves \\"of a prodigious size\\", and sent a wolf pelt back to France to substantiate his claim. As the island was cleared for settlement, the gray wolf population may have been extirpated, or relocated to the mainland across the winter ice: the few subsequent wolf reports date from the mid-19th century and describe the creatures as transient visitors from across the Northumberland Strait. The decline of North American wolf populations coincided with increasing human populations and the expansion of agriculture. By the start of the 20th century, the species had almost disappeared from the eastern U.S., excepting some areas of the Appalachians and the northwestern Great Lakes Region. In Canada, the gray wolf was extirpated in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia between 1870 and 1921, and in Newfoundland around 1911. It vanished from the southern regions of Quebec and Ontario between 1850 and 1900. The gray wolf's decline in the prairies began with the extirpation of the American bison and other ungulates in the 1860s–70s. From 1900–1930, the gray wolf was virtually eliminated from the western U.S. and adjoining parts of Canada, because of intensive predator control programs aimed at eradicating the species. The gray wolf was extirpated by federal and state governments from all of the U.S. by 1960, except in Alaska and northern Minnesota. The decline in North American wolf populations was reversed from the 1930s to the early 1950s, particularly in southwestern Canada, because of expanding ungulate populations resulting from improved regulation of big game hunting. This increase triggered a resumption of wolf control in western and northern Canada. Thousands of wolves were killed from the early 1950s to the early 1960s, mostly by poisoning. This campaign was halted and wolf populations increased again by the mid-1970s. === Modern range === Captive Mexican wolf The range of the species in North America today is mostly confined to Alaska and Canada, with populations also occurring in northern Minnesota, northern and central Wisconsin, Michigan's Upper Peninsula, and small portions of Washington, Idaho, northern Oregon, and Montana. A functional wolf population should exist in California by 2024 according to estimates by state wildlife officials.La Ganga, Maria L. (May 14, 2014) \\"OR7, the wandering wolf, looks for love in all the right places\\" Los Angeles Times Canadian wolves began to naturally recolonize northern Montana around Glacier National Park in 1979, and the first wolf den in the western U.S. in over half a century was documented there in 1986. The wolf population in northwest Montana initially grew as a result of natural reproduction and dispersal to about 48 wolves by the end of 1994. From 1995–1996, wolves from Alberta and British Columbia were relocated to Yellowstone National Park and Idaho. In addition, the Mexican wolf (Canis lupus baileyi) was reintroduced to Arizona and New Mexico in 1998. The gray wolf is found in approximately 80% of its historical range in Canada, thus making it an important stronghold for the species. Canada is home to about 52,000–60,000 wolves, whose legal status varies according to province and territory. First Nations residents may hunt wolves without restriction, and some provinces require licenses for residents to hunt wolves while others do not. In Alberta, wolves on private land may be baited and hunted by the landowner without requiring a license, and in some areas, wolf hunting bounty programs exist. Large-scale wolf population control through poisoning, trapping and aerial hunting is also presently conducted by government-mandated programs in order to support populations of endangered prey species such as woodland caribou. In Alaska, the gray wolf population is estimated at 6,000–7,000, and can be legally harvested during hunting and trapping seasons, with bag limits and other restrictions. As of 2002, there are 250 wolves in 28 packs in Yellowstone, and 260 wolves in 25 packs in Idaho. The gray wolf received Endangered Species Act (ESA) protection in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan in 1974, and was reclassified from endangered to threatened in 2003. Reintroduced Mexican wolves in Arizona and New Mexico are protected under the ESA and, as of late 2002, number 28 individuals in eight packs. A female wolf shot in 2013 in Hart County, Kentucky by a hunter was the first gray wolf seen in Kentucky in modern times. DNA analysis by Fish and Wildlife laboratories showed genetic characteristics similar to those of wolves in the Great Lakes Region. In April 2019, the first wolf pups were born in California.Wolf Management Update California Department of Fish and Wildlife April - June 2019 ==See also== * List of gray wolf populations by country * OR-7, a gray wolf being electronically tracked in the northwestern United States == References Bibliography== * Category:Animal migration Category:Biogeography Category:Ecology terminology Category:Population ecology Category:Population genetics Category:Wolves ","title":"Wolf distribution"},{"id":"61300315","text":"Guyana competed in the 2019 Parapan American Games in Lima, Peru from 23 August to 1 September.

It was released in 2002.Argento, Dominick: Casa Guidi, with Frederica von Stade, Burt Hara and the Minnesota Orchestra, conducted by Eiji Oue, Reference Recordings CD, RR-100-CD, 2002 ==Background== The album contains premiere recordings of three works by Dominick Argento, the Minnesota Orchestra's Composer Laureate.https://referencerecordings.com/recording/casa-guidi-minnesota- orchestra/ Casa Guidi was composed in response to a request from the Minnesota Orchestra to write a work for Frederica von Stade to perform with them. Argento chose Elizabeth Barrett Browning's letters as a suitable text after happening upon her home while visiting Florence. (Von Stade had suggested that he might set something by Robert Frost, a favourite poet of hers, but he preferred working with prose rather than verse because of the greater freedom that it afforded him.) The song cycle is scored for a mezzo-soprano and a large orchestra, comprising triple woodwinds, three trumpets, four horns, three trombones, a tuba, strings and a large percussion section, as well as a mandolin, a harp, a piano and chimes playing offstage. It was first performed by von Stade and the Minnesota Orchestra under the direction of Sir Neville Marriner in Minneapolis on 28 September 1983, with repeat performances in Carnegie Hall later in the same season and in Minneapolis in 1996. Capriccio for Clarinet and Orchestra was commissioned by the Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra for their principal clarinetist, George Silfies, and was first performed by them under the direction of Leonard Slatkin in the Powell Symphony Hall, Saint Louis on 16 May 1986.. Its first Minneapolis performance was by Joseph Longo and the Minnesota Orchestra, again under Slatkin, on 17 July 1986. In Praise of Music was commissioned by the Minnesota Orchestra to commemorate the seventy-fifth anniversary of the orchestra's founding, and was first performed by them under the direction of Stanislaw Skrowaczewski in Minneapolis on 23 and 24 September 1977. ==Recording== The album was recorded digitally on 29 and 31 May 2001 (tracks 1–5) and on 1 and 2 May 2002 (tracks 6–15). The engineers used studio reference monitor loudspeakers designed by Neil Patel and Keith O. Johnson, and built by Avalon Acoustics of Boulder, Colorado. ==Cover art== The cover of the album, designed under the art direction of Bill Roarty of JTH, features a photograph of von Stade taken by Marcia Lieberman. ==Critical receptionReviews=== Dominick Argento, photographed by King Elder in 2016 Joseph Stevenson reviewed the album in Classics Today. In 1983, he wrote, the English conductor Neville Marriner had urged the Minnesota Orchestra to commission Dominick Argento to compose a song cycle for the operatic mezzo-soprano Frederica von Stade. Argento, who found prose more sympathetic to his idiom than verse, had decided to set excerpts from the letters that the English poet Elizabeth Barrett Browning had written to her sister while living a blissful life with her husband, the poet Robert Browning, in an apartment in Casa Guidi, a house in Florence, Italy. Von Stade had sung the cycle so often - if usually with piano or chamber group accompaniment rather than in the orchestral version of its first edition - that she \\"virtually becomes Elizabeth when she sings it\\". Her performance on the album had a good claim to be definitive, \\"capturing a supreme vocal artist near her peak in her most characteristic repertoire\\". Her voice remained almost what it had been when she made her first records in the early 1970s.http://www.arkivmusic.com/classical/album.jsp?album_id=62450 In Praise of Music was also the fruit of a commission by the Minnesota Orchestra, in this case to celebrate the seventy-fifth anniversary of its formation. In crafting his suite, Argento had taken themes from a range of different cultures and from a range of different periods in history. \\"The result is dazzlingly diverse as it moves from Japanese court music to Tunisian street music (and other equally unlikely juxtapositions) seemingly without effort\\". Elizabeth Barrett Browning with her son Pen in 1860 The album's other work, Capriccio for Clarinet and Orchestra, was commissioned by the Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra. In truth, it was a clarinet concerto, but Argento was so in awe of Mozart's concerto for the instrument, its slow movement in particular, that he preferred not to give his piece a name that might invite comparisons with it. Argento had subtitled his work \\"Rossini in Paris\\" because it was partly inspired by Gioachino Rossini's Péchés de vieillesse (\\"Sins of old age\\"). Argento's music did not appropriate any of Rossini's melodies, but responded to the general feeling of what he had written. The Capriccio was light of heart but not light in substance - it was a \\"virtuosic, full-scale\\" work, and its slow movement and Mozart's could be spoken of in the same breath. Burt Hara's performance as the soloist was \\"exciting and good- humoured\\". All in all, the album scored ten out of ten, and its engineering was as impressive as its music. Reference Recordings' HDCD represented \\"the state of the art in standard CD production\\", and actually sounded better than most Super Audio CDs. It was highly recommended. Anthony Burton reviewed the album in BBC Music Magazine. Casa Guidi, he wrote, reflected the glowing contentment of the life that Elizabeth Barrett Browning had enjoyed with he husband during their years in Florence. Frederica von Stade's performance of the cycle did not find her in quite as fresh a vocal condition as when she had premiered it eighteen years previously, but she was as easy to like as ever, and she delivered the \\"highly singable\\" music that Argento had composed for her \\"with great authority\\".http://www.classical-music.com/review/argento-1 The Capriccio for Clarinet and Orchestra was \\"essentially light music blown up to concerto length\\", but its gentle last bars worked well, and Burt Hara was a fluent soloist. In Praise of Music developed tunes from various places and times into \\"a sequence of 'songs for orchestra' of Respighi-like brilliance\\". The Minnesota Orchestra was \\"magnificent\\" throughout. Reference Recordings' engineers has created a \\"broad yet detailed sound-picture\\", although some listeners would find the gulf between the album's quietest and loudest passages too extreme for domestic comfort. ===Accolades=== The album won a Grammy award for the best contemporary classical composition of 2003, and was nominated for a Grammy for the year's best classical vocal solo performance .https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/frederica-von-stade-0 ==CD track listing== Dominick Argento (1927–2019) Casa Guidi: Five Songs for Mezzo- soprano and Orchestra: Letters of Elizabeth Barrett Browning to her Sister, with texts adapted by Argento (Minneapolis, 1983) * 1 (4:15) \\"Casa Guidi\\" * 2 (3:36) \\"The Italian cook and the English maid\\" * 3 (6:09) \\"Robert Browning\\" * 4 (2:47) \\"The death of Mr Barrett\\" * 5 (5:01) \\"Domesticity\\" Capriccio for Clarinet and Orchestra: Rossini in Paris (Saint Louis, 1986) * 6 (7:27) \\"Une réjouissance\\" * 7 (6:37) \\"Une caresse à ma femme\\" * 8 (9:23) \\"Un petit train du plaisir\\" In Praise of Music: Seven Songs for Orchestra (Minneapolis, 1977) * 9 (5:27) \\"For the healer, David\\", lento solenne *10 (3:04) \\"For the god, Apollo\\", deciso e mosso *11 (5:56) \\"For the satyr, Pan\\", quasi cadenza *12 (4:58) \\"For the sorrower, Orpheus\\", tempo rubato e rapsodico *13 (4:24) \\"For the angel, Israfel\\", allegro e gioioso *14 (4:31) \\"For the saint, Cecilia\\", adagio e sereno *15 (4:37) \\"For the child, Mozart\\", largo cantabile ==Personnel== The drawing room of Casa Guidi, now a museum ===Musical=== * Frederica von Stade (b. 1945), mezzo-soprano (tracks 1–5) * Burt Hara, clarinet (tracks 6–8) * Minnesota Orchestra * Eiji Oue (b. 1956), conductor ===Other=== * J.

Her formal debut was at Prince's Hall on 23 May 1891 in a production that alternated between violin solos, songs, and a quartet by the composer Louis Spohr.

Its script was written by Bianka Minte-König and it is based on the book series Freche Mädchen – freche Bücher. == Plot == Mila, Hanna and Kati - all 14 years old - are best friends and would do everything for each other. Together, they set up their music teacher with their German teacher in order to improve Mila's grades. Regarding their own lives, the girl are confused about love: At first, Kati adores “Sandwich”-Tobi (a nickname the girls got him because you always find him eating a sandwich), but since he does not seem to notice her like she would want him to, Kati falls in love with her cousin Florian. Hanna has a crush as well and starts dating Branko, who is a few years older than the girls. Only Mila's love life doesn't seem to exist, until she meets trainee teacher Pit Winter, the stand-in for her pregnant German teacher. Mila even anonymously writes a love poem for him but when she finds out that her mother suddenly has a dinner date with Pit, Mila’s love-life takes a turn to the worse. Pit Winter reads the poem and somehow knows that Mila was the one who wrote it. Sadly, the only aspect he focusses on, are the errors Mila made due to her dyslexia. For Kati and Hanna, things do not go well anymore either. Florian fell in love with his piano teacher and therefore breaks up with Kati shortly before her birthday party. Branko and Hanna are squabbling with each other because Mila and Hanna have applied for a casting show Hanna keeps participating at although Branko feels ashamed about her being part of it. But there is someone else Hanna has met at the casting... The three girls are alone again and are busy with problems like Vanessa, the ‘Drama Queen’, ‘Porn- Kiwi’(a nickname he was given by the girls, because he constantly watches porn) or the annoying Maths teacher. Marcus, whom Mila sees as a macho slowly sneaks into her life. Brian, a new student from Hamburg causes trouble between the girls: Kati immediately falls in love with him and demands that no one else should get too close to him. When Mila rewrites a poem for Brian who turns it into a song, an icy mood comes up between Kati and Mila. During a school trip to a planetarium, somebody kissed Mila in the dark which lead her to the conclusion that Brian could possibly like her instead of Kati. In addition, someone called Pegasus sends Mila romantic messages and translates a song text for her - all signs point to Brian being her admire, don't they? When Mila’s mother announces her pregnancy and that Pit Winter is the father of the baby, Mila’s drama is complete. She runs away in anger and sleeps at a suspension railway station. The next morning, Markus shows up at the station and takes her to his father’s riding school. When Mila sees a picture of a class-trip, where everybody gathered around a statue of Pegasus and next to it a picture of herself with Markus, she realizes that Markus must be Pegasus. Overwhelmed by this discovery, she walks back home. At home, her mother is very happy and relieved to see Mila, and she tells her that the pregnancy test showed a wrong result – She is not pregnant. She adds that Pit Winter would not have wanted a child with her anyway and wishes for Mila to find a nice boy, who appreciates her, for who she is. This moment is an eye-opener for Mila. Together with her mother, she drives back to the riding school. She finds Markus on top of a hill he had shown her before, as it has a special meaning to him, and kisses him. Not just Mila but everybody gets their happy end: Sure, Kati had a crush on Brian but after seeing that he already has a girlfriend she leaves his concert in a sad mood. On her way home, Kati gets attacked by a drunk guy in a tunnel. Luckily, Tobi is nearby to defend her and “knocks” him to the ground. Kati being Kati, without a second thought, instantly falls madly in love with Tobi all over again. In the meantime, Hanna is in Munich for the casting show and made it to the quarterfinals. Shortly before her next performance, her talisman – a heart – starts to glow. The talisman was a gift from Branko. He himself has a second heart and they both start to glow if the other heart is nearby. Finally, Hanna and Branko find each other and they get together again after Hanna was eliminated from the show during the quarterfinals. ==References External links== * * Category:2008 films ","title":"Freche Mädchen"},{"id":"61300828","text":"Simanikas during the Macedonian Struggle Ioannis Simanikas (Greek: Ιωάννης Σημανίκας) was a Greek chieftain of the Macedonian Struggle. == Biography == Simanikas was born in Naousa of Imathia in the late 19th century.

The second album, Angústia Suprema (1997), arouses interest outside the religious milieu and is highly praised by specialized magazines. In 1999, the band recorded Olhando de Frente. In 2002, after the exchange of vocalist (Marcelo Machado by the then new vocal Guilherme de Sá), due to the former vocalist claim not to be able to reconcile his other project with the band, Rosa de Saron launches Depois do Inverno, which shows the whole phase of renewal that the band was passing, already with Guilherme de Sá assuming the vocals, after having recorded a tape with his test. The record enshrines the band in the music scene. In 2005, he released Casa dos Espelhos and in 2007, the band recorded the Acoustic CD, where he recorded several of his acoustic hits, including the unreleased song \\"Monte Inverno\\". In April 2008, to celebrate 20 years of career, they recorded the first DVD, and from that, the sixth CD, titled Acústico and ao Vivo. the CD / DVD is released by Codimuc and later released to re-release along with Som Livre in January 2009.

After the notoriety with the acoustic format, they return to the electric format releasing the album Horizonte Distant, that granted the band a new Gold Record. In September 2010, the band recorded in São Paulo, its second live DVD, and coming from this the eighth CD, titled Horizonte Vivo Distante, with the participation of the singer Maurício Manieri in the song \\"Rara Calma\\", which was nominated for a Latin Grammy and once again awarded the band the Golden Record. Then they released an EP titled Siete Camiños, with songs re-recorded in other languages, taking advantage of the opportunity that the band had to present at World Youth Day 2011 in Madrid. In 2012, backing to the studios, the band launches the CD O Agora e O Eterno, with 17 unpublished songs, which reaffirmed the vocation of good acceptance of the band in all means, religious or not, once again obtaining Gold Album by job. In 2013, they recorded the tenth CD and third live DVD of their career, titled Latitude, Longitude, recorded at Chevrolet Hall in Belo Horizonte, once again among the best sellers in the country.

In the mid-1990s, members of the Rosa de Saron band decided to use heavy rock to evangelize and to some extent leverage the Catholic rock circuit. In this phase the band was formed by Marcelo \\"Tchelão\\" Machado (vocal), Alessandro (drums), Eduardo \\"Duzinho\\" Faro (guitar), Alex Nozaki Mota (guitar), Rogério \\"Cazuza\\" Feltrin (bass) and Eduardo Bortolato). In 1994 the first album, Diante da Cruz, was released. The disc became a reference in the religious medium, for containing an unprecedented sound in its segment, mixing hard rock with heavy metal. It was released independently on vinyl and cassette in 1995. In 1996, with the founding of Codimuc, the work was re- released. After the release of the work, Alex Nozaki left the band, and Welington Greve (Grevão) takes the drums instead of Alessandro. In 1997 the band released the album Supreme Angústia, which was produced by Daniel Stiling. In 1998, the group completed its 10 years of existence, and in the same year a show took place in the Parque do Taquaral, in Campinas, where the first Catholic rock festival in history was held. As of 1999, the band started to admit other aspects of rock, and in the same period the band released the first Catholic single, Olhando de Frente, which had a pre-release on a band show at Canção Nova, in Cachoeira Paulista, on 25 June 1999. Shortly thereafter Marcelo Machado leaves Rosa de Saron to continue his work with The Flanders, claiming that it is difficult to reconcile the two bands. To replace Tchelão, they selected Guilherme de Sá in 2001, and released in 2002 the album Depois do Inverno, which marked a new phase in the band's career, with the highlight of the hit \\"Do Alto da Pedra\\". On 20 April 2005, at Credicard Hall, the band participated in a DVD in celebration of 15 years of the record label Codimuc with 3 songs: \\"Do Alto da Pedra\\", \\"Sangria\\" and \\"Muitos Choram\\". In \\"Sangria\\", there was the participation of Marcelo Machado (the former vocalist). The date of the recording of the disc marked 20 days of the death of Pope John Paul II. === 2005–2008: Other recordings === In 2005 was released the album Casa dos Espelhos.

The repercussion of the album made the band for the first time nominated for the Latin Grammy in the category \\"Best Christian Music Album in Portuguese.\\" In September 2010, the band recorded in São Paulo, their second live DVD entitled \\"Horizonte Vivo Distante\\", recorded at HSBC Brasil. The audience totaled more than 3,500 people and counted on the participation of Mauricio Manieri in \\"Rara Calma\\".

The most well-known explanation is that it represents the four members around the Eucharist (in the center) with the symmetry of a cross. But in an interview the own creator of the logo states: \\"It represents a stylized rose, seen from above. The four petals represent the four members of the Band that unite in a single head (same goal), and this object is finished with the general image inspired by the Cross of St. Benedict. Thus, this would be the true meaning\\". == Members  Current training === * Bruno Faglioni – Vocals (2019–present) * Eduardo Faro – Guitar (1990–present) * Rogério \\"Lerão\\" Feltrin – Bass(1988–present) * Wellington \\"Grevão\\" Greve – Drums (1995–present) === Support Musicians === * Adriano Mota – Guitar (2011–present) === Former members === * Marcelo \\"Tchelão\\" Machado – vocal (1988–2000) * Alessandro \\"Sandão\\" – battery (1988–1995) * Alex Nozaki – guitar (1990–1995) * Eduardo Bortolatto – keyboard (1990–1998) * Paulo Faganello – keyboard (2002) * Guilherme de Sá – vocal (2001–2019) * Marcus Paulo – Keyboard and Backing Vocal (2014–2019) * Fábio Corrêa – Keyboard (2016) * Gustavo Leite – keyboard (2008–2012) * Eduardo Veloso \\"Du Bboy\\" – DJ, VJ and Backing vocal (2009–2015) == Discography  Studio albums === *1994: Diante da Cruz *1997: Angústia Suprema *2002: Depois do Inverno *2005: Casa dos Espelhos *2007: Acústico *2009: Horizonte Distante *2012: O Agora e o Eterno *2014: Cartas ao Remetente *2018: Gran Paradiso === Live albums === *2008: Acústico e ao Vivo *2010: Horizonte Vivo Distante *2013: Latitude, Longitude *2015: Acústico e ao Vivo 2/3 === EPs === *1999: Olhando de Frente *2011: Siete Camiños === Collection === * 2016: Essencial === Singles === * 2013: Aurora (Participation: Renato Vianna, Jhonny Voice) * 2018: Invisibili Orme (Participation: Sister Cristina) * 2019: A Fênix * 2019: Um Dia * 2019: Esperando na Janela (Cogumelo Plutão Cover) * 2019: Somos (Participation: Thiago Brado) == Videography  Live DVDs === * 2008: Acústico e Ao Vivo * 2010: Horizonte Vivo Distante * 2013: Latitude, Longitude * 2015: Acústico e Ao Vivo 2/3 === Collectings in DVD === * 2016: Essencial === Documentary DVDs === * 2011: Rosa na Estrada == Books == * 2008 – Rock, Faith and Poetry – 20 years of Rosa de Saron narrated through their music.

His philosophy, particularly his constructive work, draws from classical and medieval sources as well as religious texts. Goodman is also an academic, scholar, and a historian with research interest in metaphysics, ethics, and Jewish philosophy. == Biography == Goodman was born in Detroit, Michigan. He is the son of Calvin and Florence Goodman. His father was a World War II veteran while his mother was a poet and professor of English. His family moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts and later to Putney, Vermont before finally settling in Los Angeles, California. In 1965, Goodman completed a bachelor's degree in Philosophy and Middle Eastern Languages and Literatures at Harvard University. He later obtained his doctorate in 1968 as a Marshall Scholar. Goodman started teaching at the University of California Los Angeles, (UCLA) in 1969. He transferred to the University of Hawaii and was part of its Department of Philosophy until 1994. He is currently an Andrew W. Mellon Professor in Humanities at Vanderbilt University. Goodman was a recipient of several awards such as the Baumgardt Memorial Award, the Gratz Centennial Prize, and the Earl Sutherland Prize, which is Vanderbilt University's highest research award. Goodman is married to Roberta Goodman and is the father of the novelist and short story writer Allegra Goodman and Paula Fraenkel. == Works == One of Goodman's philosophical projects is realist messianism, which evaluates the means to the messianic end. Particularly, Goodman holds that the Torah and the way its principles are operationalized can be used to refine and perfect human nature. According to him, such refinement process leads towards a messianic age. It is associated with the Jewish concept of olam ha-ba or the world to come, which is used instead of the after life. It constitutes an internalist position wherein the arrival of the Messiah is not enough if there is no moral transformation among the faithful. The messiahnic age is said to be the teleological consummation of human intellectual, moral, and spiritual potential. Goodman distinguished this concept from the personal Messiah, which he said is not particularly successful among the Jewish people. Goodman also used Baruch Spinoza's views in his discourse on Jewish philosophy. Particularly, he maintained that the Dutch thinker's philosophy addresses the problems that the Jewish philosophical tradition share with other school through creative and constructive solutions. Goodman also found several Jewish themes in the Spinoza's philosophy. There is, for instance, the strong emphasis on philosophical monotheism, driving what Goodman believes as the most coherent metaphysical approach to philosophical speculation. Goodman also supported Spinoza's reconciliations of classical oppositions. This is demonstrated in the way perfection and imperfection have been reconciled. In reconstructing Spinoza, Goodman, said that God becomes the image of imperfect humanity not because perfection \\"becomes an active principle at work in the mind\\". Goodman translated Ibn Tufayl's 12th-century Arabic novel called Hayy ibn Yaqzan. This work also included philosophical commentary. == References == Category:University of California, Los Angeles faculty Category:University of Hawaii at Manoa faculty Category:Vanderbilt University faculty Category:Harvard College alumni Category:Living people Category:1944 births Category:20th-century American philosophers Category:Presidents of the Metaphysical Society of America ","title":"Lenn E.

The cover of the third version, designed by Netherlads, features a photograph of von Stade taken by Marcia Lieberman. ==Critical receptionReviews=== Gioachino Rossini, painted by an unknown artist Alan Blyth reviewed the first version of the album on LP in Gramophone in February 1977. If he were in charge of an opera house, he wrote, he would be eagerly planning a staging of Rossini's Otello, That was how much he had been enthused by hearing Frederica von Stade's performance of Rossini's version of Desdemona's Willow Song scene. To understand his excitement, readers had only to \\"listen how her voice runs delicately through the phrase 'Salce d'amor delizia' ending with a heartrending diminuendo ... or how affectingly she touches in the recitative, or how she rightly allows a little harshness into her lovely tone in the word 'l'ingrato' or covers it for the Prayer\\". These details were no doubt the result of meticulous design, and yet von Stade's execution of them felt wholly free of artifice. Blyth, Alan: Gramophone, February 1977, pp. 1317-1318 Her characterization of Angelina, the Cinderella of La Cenerentola, was just as vivid a portrait (and based, thankfully, on a modern, scholarly edition of Rossini's score). The roulades of the opera's concluding scene were delineated with precision. When the La Scala company had recently brought their production of La Cenerentola to Covent Garden, Lucia Valentini Terrani had presented Angelina's music with \\"a fearsome and speedy brilliance\\"; von Stade, \\"forgetting and forgiving in her final Rondo\\", offered \\"a tender lightness that is just as winning\\". Von Stade had also recently sung Rossini at the Royal Opera House, debuting there as Rosina in Il barbiere di Siviglia. Her recording of \\"Una voce poco fà\\" was \\"as bewitchingly as on stage\\". Her Rosina was mischievous and flirtatious, but had a gentleness about her too, as well as a rapid vibrato that was rather appealing. All three items on the A side of the LP were very effective dramatically. The B side began with a portrayal of Mozart's Cherubino that was no less compelling. Just as she had when appearing in Le nozze di Figaro at Glyndebourne, von Stade brought us \\"a palpitating youth - swooning, too, in a nicely easy-going and varied 'Voi che sapete'\\". And her \\"tender, seductive\\" Zerlina from Don Giovanni was a girl whose embraces nobody could resist. La clemenza di Tito was the one work that von Stade drew on with less than total success. In Sesto's \\"Parto, parto\\", she was perfect - she sang its striking divisions accurately but without ostentation, and she conveyed all of Sesto's \\"sincerity and faith\\". But her reading of Vitellia's \\"Non più di fiore\\" paled by comparison with that of Janet Baker in a recent staging at Covent Garden. Baker had sung the role with a \\"variety of colour and nuance\\" that von Stade could not equal. Von Stade might make a convincingly \\"scheming, nasty\\" Vitellia one day, but that day had not come yet. Teresa Rieu was a graceful harpist accompanying Desdemona, and Bas de Jong was an unimpeachable clarinetist accompanying Sesto. George Pieterson was adroit but \\"less advantageously placed\\" with his basset-horn in Vitellia's aria. The Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra and Edo de Waart were proficient but not outstanding. Philips's engineers had put von Stade so close to her microphone that one could hear her breathing, but their balancing worked very well. George Jellinek reviewed the first version of the album on LP as a \\"recording of special merit\\" in Stereo Review in May 1977. Frederica von Stade, he wrote, had followed her first operatic recital - her Columbia disc of French Opera Arias - with a sequel of music in which she was altogether at home. Her record's B side, devoted to Mozart, was marginally better than its Rossinian side A.Jellinek, George: Stereo Review, May 1977, p. 113 Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, painted by his brother-in-law, Joseph Lange Her \\"breathlessly amorous Cherubino\\" had been relished on stage in both America and Europe, and was just as enjoyable on her album. The timbre of her high mezzo-soprano voice was ideally suited to Zerlina. And she sang \\"expertly and elegantly\\" in her two excerpts from La clemenza di Tito. In her Rossini selections, she performed \\"winningly\\" both in Desdemona's sorrowful music and in Angelina'a and Rosina's pyrotechnic bel canto showpieces. But her technique was not altogether beyond reproach. On the one hand, her fioriture in La Cenerentola and in Il barbiere di Siviglia (as in Mozart's \\"Parto. parto\\") lacked the superlative precision achieved by Janet Baker, Teresa Berganza and Marilyn Horne. On the other hand, her Rosina, while characterful, did not sound as spontaneous as was desirable. Bas de Jong and George Pieterson both negotiated their tricky obbligato woodwind parts adeptly. The playing of the Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra was \\"nicely articulated and warm\\". Condecting, Edo de Waart set far too slow a tempo for Desdemona. Philips's audio quality was very good. Profiling von Stade in Time magazine (13 December 1976), the unnamed author wrote that the album displayed \\"a lustrous amber mezzo-soprano voice with an unusually sweet crystalline top and seemingly effortless agility\\".Time, 13 December 1976, p. 101 The album was also reviewed in The complete Penguin stereo record and cassette guide, which reported that \\"Frederica von Stade is, as always, magically compelling here, both in vocal personality and in ... vocal production\\".Greenfield, Edward, Layton Robert and March, Ivan: The complete Penguin stereo record and cassette guide, Penguin, 1984, p. 1374 ===Accolades=== The album was nominated for a Grammy award for the best classical solo vocal performance of 1977.https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/frederica-von-stade-0 Alan Blyth included the album in his 1977 Gramophone Critics' Choice list of the best recordings of the year.Blyth, Alan: Gramophone, December 1977, p. 1016 ==Track listingsFirst and third versions=== Philips LP (9500-098) and PentaTone SACD (5186-158) Gioachino Rossini (1792-1868) Il barbiere di Siviglia, ossia L'inutile precauzione (\\"The barber of Seville, or The useless precaution\\", Rome, 1816), with a libretto by Cesare Sterbini (1784-1831) after Le Barbier de Séville (1775) by Pierre Beaumarchais (1732-1799) * 1 (5:46) Cavatina (Rosina): \\"Una voce poco fà...Io sono docile\\" Otello, ossia Il moro di Venezia (\\"Othello, or The Moor of Venice\\", Naples, 1816), with a libretto by Francesco Maria Berio, Marchese di Salsa, after The tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice (?1603) by William Shakespeare (1564-1616) * 2 (13:35) Canzona e preghiera (Desdemona): \\"Assisa a piè d'un salice...Deh! calma, o ciel, nel sonno\\" La Cenerentola, ossia La bontà in trionfo (\\"Cinderella, or Goodness triumphant\\", Rome, 1817), with a libretto by Jacopo Ferretti (1784-1852) after Cendrillon, ou la petite pantoufle de verre (\\"Cinderella, or The little glass slipper\\", 1697) by Charles Perrault (1628-1703) * 3 (6:26) Rondo (Angelina): \\"Nacqui all' affanno...Non più mesta\\" Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756-1791) Le nozze di Figaro (\\"The marriage of Figaro\\", K. 492, Vienna, 1786), with a libretto by Lorenzo da Ponte (1749-1838) after La folle journée, ou le Mariage de Figaro (\\"The mad day, or The marriage of Figaro\\", 1784) by Pierre Beaumarchais (1732-1799) * 4 (3:05) Aria (Cherubino): \\"Non so più\\" * 5 (3:10) Canzona (Cherubino) \\"Voi, che sapete\\" La clemenza di Tito (\\"The clemency of Titus\\", K. 621, Prague, 1791), with a libretto by Caterino Mazzolà (1745-1806) after Pietro Metastasio (1698-1782) * 6 (9:27) Recitativo accompagnato e rondo (Vitellia): \\"Ecco il punto...Non più di fiori\\" Il dissoluto punito, ossia il Don Giovanni (\\"The rake punished, or Don Giovanni\\", K. 527, Prague, 1787), with a libretto by Lorenzo da Ponte after El burlador de Seville y convidado de piedra (\\"The trickster of Seville and the stone guest\\", ?1616) by Tirso de Molina (1579-1648) * 7 (3:57) Aria (Zerlina): Vedrai, carino La clemenza di Tito * 8 (6:30) Aria (Sesto): \\"Parto, parto...Guardami, e tutto obblio\\" ===Second version=== Philips CD (420-084-2) Joseph Haydn (1732-1809) La fedeltà premiata (\\"Fidelity rewarded\\", Hob.

How Bassett came to own it and its prior history are currently unknown. It is, however, very likely that the mummy was one of a number saved from being processed into fertiliser in the 1890s.

These had been discovered (by accident) in 1889 at Speos Artemidos, close to Beni Hasan, Egypt. Some of the better preserved cats, or parts of them, were auctioned off singly; a number of these are on display at the National Museums Liverpool’s World Museum.

The canal is the southernmost in the Jordaan neighbourhood and borders the west part of the Grachtengordel (Canal District). ==Name== The Passeerdersgracht is named after a passeerderij, an old name for a workshop where (Spanish) leather was manufactured and processed. ==History== The canal originated when the canal belt was dug south from the Brouwersgracht starting in 1612. In the 19th century six of the eleven Jordaan canals were filled in. Only the Bloemgracht, Egelantiersgracht, Lauriergracht, Looiersgracht and Passeerdersgracht remained, connecting to the Prinsengracht, Keizersgracht, Herengracht, Singel, Lijnbaansgracht, Brouwersgracht, Leliegracht and Leidsegracht. The former Hogeschool voor Economische Studies (School of Economic Studies; HES) / First Public Trade School on the corner of Passeerdersgracht, is located on a filled-in part of Lijnbaansgracht: the Raamplein. In many places in the Jordaan there were so-called gangen, alleys or corridors between the houses. These narrow alleys gave access to rear areas that held courtyards where the less fortunate lived in often dilapidated shelters, often built illegally. For example, in the \\"Walenhoek\\" on the Passeerdersgracht there was the \\"Walengang\\" between numbers 15 and 17. This corridor was demolished in 1850 for construction of the former Toevlugt voor Behoeftigen on Passeerdersgracht 9–19. The building of the former Arbeidsbeurs on Passeerdersgracht 28-32, at the corner of Tweede Passeerdersdwarsstraat, was designed around 1915 by architects Joan van der Mey and Piet Kramer. Until the summer of 2012 this monumental building housed one of the two branches of the Amsterdam youth circus Circus Elleboog. Elleboog then moved to a new location, Laan van Spartaan in Amsterdam-West. Most of the canal houses on the Passeerdersgracht have been converted into residential houses. ==Trivia== In the book Rood paleis (Red Palace) by Ferdinand Bordewijk there is a brothel on the center of Passeerdersgracht, just before the outbreak of World War I. ==See also == *Canals of Amsterdam File:Jan van der Heijden (1637-1712), Afb 010001000086.jpgA partially burned down turpentine oil burner on the Passeerdersgracht (1690).

In 1863, Graham married Emma Post, and in the early 1870s the couple and their family moved into Lowell. In 1873, Graham constructed this duplex home, with one half housing his family and the other half housing Emma's parents, Joseph and Julia Post. One of the Graham's children was Ernest R. Graham, who went on to become a nationally recognized architect, working in Chicago. In 1899, Ernest Graham inherited the Lowell home, and rented it out as apartments. In 1922, he invited the Lowell library, then without a building, to use one half of the first floor. The library remained in the building even after Ernest Graham's death in 1936. In 1954, the village of Lowell purchased the house from the Graham heirs, to use as a home for the library. In 1997, the library moved to a new location, and by 2001 the Lowell Area Historical Museum had opened in the house. ==Description== The Graham House is a two-story yellow brick Italianate structure on a stone foundation, built as a two-family dwelling.

When he died in 1433 she took over the job. She had the task of gathering the toll from boats that sailed under the bridge and from the wagons that passed over it into London. The task was complicated because the fee depended on what was being carried. A woman having a position of authority and responsibility in the fifteenth century was unusual.

Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at: http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=1030863 on 2019-07-17 ==Description== The length of the shell attains 5 mm, its diameter 2 mm. (Original description) The narrow shell has an ovate-fusiform shape. It is turreted and sharply angled below a sloping shoulder. Its colour is white, from the suture to the angle opaque, below the angle hyaline with opaque beads. The protoconch is buff yellow, a splash of the same on the anterior dorsal portion of the body whorl, a pale yellow thread, confined to one spiral cord, ascends each whorl below the angle, and another surrounds the body whorl below the periphery. The adult contains 4½ whorls. The body whorl bears fifteen longitudinal costae which cross the flattened part of the whorl obliquely, where they are separated by twice their breadth. Above the angle they bend and enlarge suddenly. Towards the base they curve in and vanish at the basal constriction. On the penultimate whorl these costae alternate with those below the suture. These longitudinal costae are over-ridden by a series of fine sharp spiral cords knotted at each costa. The body whorl carries four larger and more undulating ones above the angle and ten below it. On the base are six simple cords. The protoconch is horny, mamillate, three and a half whorled, the larger sculptured with a raised network, contrasting sharply by colour and texture with the adult shell, which suddenly commences with a thick raised white tongue at the suture. The aperture is narrow and elliptical. The columella is arched, overlaid by a callus which ends abruptly where the aperture narrows. The siphonal canal is short and wide. The outer lip is massive, ridged externally by a dozen transverse cords which denticulate the edges. Within are seven weak entering ridges. The aperture mounts the preceding whorl to the height of two spiral cords, and encloses a deep wide anal notch with a prominent callus. Ch. Hedley (1896) - The Mollusca of Funafuti, and supplement.

Meanwhile, British clippers continued to be built into the 1870s before they were shifted into the wool trade. The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 was the eventual demise of the tea clipper as the shorter route allowed larger cargo ships passage to China. The remaining clippers profited by serving the wool trade as the need for coal hindered steamships from reaching Australian ports. The shift eventually came when steamships became so large that they could hold an ample amount of coal without constantly refueling. By the time of Cromdales launch in 1891, ocean liners that could carry large amounts of passengers and cargo had entered the scene. ==History== The wreck of the Cromdale Cromdale was built at Barclay Curle in Glasgow, and launched in June, 1891. She had an identical sister ship named Mount Stewart that was launched a month earlier from the shipyard. These ships had the most modern features of their time in terms of structure and design. The first master of Cromdale was a captain named E.H. Andrew, who was very experienced and up to date on the newest technological features. She was ultimately lost in 1913 under the command of Captain Arthur while she was homeward bound from Taltal with a cargo of nitrate. Cromdale was 126 days out heading for Falmouth (UK) and had been in dense fog for a few days. While a steamer passed and advised Arthur to alter his course, a light was suddenly seen ahead through the fog shortly afterwards. Arthur tried to turn the ship about but it was too late, and she struck rocks at the foot of a cliff. This cliff was discovered later to be part of Bass Point which is close to Lizard Lighthouse. The lifeboats were ordered lowered immediately due to the damage the ship had endured, but luck was on the side of the crew. The weather was calm, distress rockets were at hand, and rescuers from land arrived shortly to assist. Cromdale was declared a total loss after she settled quickly, and was found to be laying in a position that was exposed to the elements. ==External linksReferences== Category:Clippers Category:Individual sailing vessels Category:Victorian-era merchant ships of the United Kingdom Category:Ships built in Glasgow Category:Maritime incidents in 1913 Category:1891 ships Category:Wool trade ","title":"Cromdale (clipper)"},{"id":"61301541","text":"Brother's Day is a 2019 Indian Malayalam-language family thriller film written and directed by Kalabhavan Shajohn in his directorial debut.

During the Cultural Revolution in 1960s, he moved Yunnan into Burma and then joined to help strengthen the Communist Party of Burma (CPB), has until now enjoyed considerable economic success in Mong La. He became a field commander in CPB zone 815, or present- day Mong La. When the Party disintegrated after the Wa rank-and-file revolted against its leadership in 1989, he headed one of the largest breakaway factions, the National Democratic Alliance Army. He was one of the several ex- CPB commanders to sign a ceasefire with the government in Rangoon, allowing the former communist the opportunity to create his own fiefdom centered first on the opium trade and then gambling as Special Region 4 became “opium free” in 1997. To placate Lin and guarantee he would not take up arms again, Burmese authorities granted him generous terms. Mong La became an autonomous zone and his well-equipped private army of several thousand men retained its arms. Additionally, he was given several business concessions—the tacit permission for the opium trade being the most lucrative. As the billboard commemorates, it was Khin Nyunt himself who flew in to seal the pact with a shady handshake. Soon new refineries in his area went into operation. By the early-1990s Lin headed one of the most powerful drug syndicates in northern Burma with an output of one to two thousand kilograms of pure heroin annually. For years he was high on the hitlist of the US State Department. Lin made a few abortive attempts to develop traditional business interests in the city. He invested some $4 million in a sugar mill outside Mong La, only to find that no market existed for the sugar. A similar attempt to cultivate new varieties of rice also faltered when he failed to attract Chinese buyers. Lin’s construction outfit Asia Wealth Company has built a new sealed road that links Sop Lwe to the outside world. Lin is married to Nang Yin (), the eldest daughter of Pheung Kya-shin, the chairman of the Kokang Special Region in Myanmar (Burma) and the leader of the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA). ==See also== * National Democratic Alliance Army * Shan State Special region 4 ==References== Category:1945 births Category:Burmese people of Chinese descent Category:Living people ","title":"Sai Leun"},{"id":"61301644","text":"Ásdís Thoroddsen (born February 26, 1959) is an Icelandic director, producer, screenwriter, and actress. == Biography == Thoroddsen was born on February 26, 1959 in Reykjavik, Iceland.

It claims to recount the misdeeds of a papal mistress, and also satirizes the enemies of Queen Anne of Great Britain. == Plot == The novel takes place in Rome, where Donna Olimpia, the amoral mistress of Pope Innocent X, tries to gain power over Antonio Barbarino (the cardinal of the novel's title). She seizes her chance when Antonio admits to lusting after Melora, the French Ambassador's daughter. Olimpia makes friends with Melora, and tells her romantic stories designed to persuade the inexperienced younger woman to fall for Antonio's seduction. Olimpio narrates the first story, 'the History of Alphonsus and Cordelia', which tricks Melora into believing that Antonio is in fact Alphonsus, the heir to the Duke of Ferrara. Francisco (a favourite of Antonio) narrates the second story, 'the History of Emilius and Lovisa', which persuades Melora that true lovers can triumph over all odds (including their public duties and even parental opposition) in order to be together. As a result of Olimpia's deception, the naive Melora is tricked into secretly 'marrying' Antonio (she does not realise that this marriage is actually non-legal). After some months, Antonio grows tired of Melora and decides to murder her. She is given poison and dies, despite the efforts of Francisco (who now repents his role in her seduction) to save her in time. == Reception == The Inhumane Cardinal first brought Pix's writing to public attention, and may even have won her the patronage of Queen Anne or her circle. Despite this, it has received little scholarly attention. However, Sonia Villegas Lopez suggests that it is a significant text for understanding the history of the novel because (1) it combined different subgenres at a time when the new narrative form of the novel was being significantly reconfigured; and (2) it marks a standpoint in this narrative evolution, as its very structure plays with the notions of ‘truth’ and ‘virtue’. Steven Moore also argue that the novella has some distinctive features: > 'Although The Inhumane Cardinal isn't great literature ... it stands apart > from other novels of the period because of its bleak view of human nature. > ... It is pervaded with the Jacobean sense of life as passionate, cruel, and > corrupt. Though written by a woman, it is unusually harsh on women - Pix > harps upon their vanity, ambition, duplicity, and gullibility - and it is > one of the few novels of the time that makes explicit reference to sodomy'. == References == Category:1696 novels Category:17th-century English novels Category:English novels Category:British novellas Category:Novels set in Rome ","title":"The Inhumane Cardinal; or, Innocence Betrayed"},{"id":"61301659","text":"Bachia guianensis, the Guyana bachia, is a species of lizard in the family Gymnophthalmidae.

His father Alexander Lazarevich Shaulov (07.06.1935 - 07.12.2002) was a Cand. Sc. History; mother Tamara Ivanovna Shaulova (09.09.1940, nee Khripko) gave art and technical drawing lessons at a local public school. In 1971 the Shaulov family moved to the little town of Persianovka, Oktyabrsky District, Rostov Oblast, where his father gave history lessons at Don Agricultural College (now - Don State Agrarian University). After passing his graduation exams at Novocherkassk's secondary public school No.32, where his mother taught art, Lazar Shaulov entered faculty of agriculture of Don Agricultural College, where he was one of the top students. Following a work placement session at the end of his sophomore year, Shaulov dropped out from college being unsatisfied with future prospects. In 1988 he took up a job of apprentice lathe operator at Novocherkassk Electric Locomotive Plant, but two years later quit the job, deciding to follow in his father's footsteps. After almost two-years of preparation, Shaulov successfully entered the faculty of history at Rostov State University, which he graduated in 1995.

During the 1930s, badminton had become a popular sport in the United States. Establishments such as the YMCA, universities and more all formed badminton clubs and the popularity of the sport began to take growth. The sport was also aided by the support of celebrity participation. Celebrities such as Bette Davis, Douglas Fairbanks, Dick Powell and more all participated in the sport helping badminton gain popularity during the mid half of the 20th century. Starting in 1936 the American Badminton Association was formed, however, in 1978 and 1996 the name would be changed to its current name of USA Badminton ( or USAB). The main reason for the evolutionary changes is because different groups and clubs from all around the United States joined together to standardize the rules of the game. The time period between 1949 and 1967 was the biggest period of badminton popularity in the United States. In 1949 David Freeman brought the United States its first ever world championships. Freeman won the Men's Singles at the All-England Championships. Additionally, between 1949 and 1967 the United States won 23 championships in badminton. The success led to Sports Illustrated featuring Joe Alston on the Cover of the March issue of 1955 to recognize the United States successes in badminton during that time period. In 2016, USAB announced that they would be relocating their professional training facilities and headquarters from Colorado Spring to Anaheim California. == Important Figures  Ben Lee === Lee is the current Board of Directors Chair.

Coaching Director  Pauls term will run until 2020 where he will be up for re-election. If elected, Paul can serve up to another four years. == Popularity of Badminton == Badminton is not a popular sport in the United States for several reasons. One of the main reasons is because badminton in the United States is seen as a backyard sport. Due to this, the sport has not grown much in the United States. Another reason is the lack of olympic success. Team USAB has not had much success in their olympic runs. This lack of success is another reason why the sport has not grown in comparison to other sports that have had olympic success. Finally, wages are a huge reason why badminton has not gown. Badminton fails to receive a lot of media attention in the United States and with that comes low wages. Participants can earn up to $15,000 for winning a championship. That is a relatively small amount of money in comparison to the average football player that has a salary of 2.7 million dollars. == Diane Cornell == January 7, 2020 marks the death of Diane Cornell.

The insupportable yoke of Ottoman tyranny hath weighed down for above a century the unhappy Greeks of the Peloponnesus. So excessive had its rigour become, that its fainting victims had scarcely strength enough to utter groans. In this state, deprived of all our rights, we have unanimously resolved to take up arms against our tyrants. All our intestine discord is plunged into oblivion as a fruit of oppression, and we breathe the air of liberty. Our bands having burst their fetters, already signalize themselves against the barbarians. We no longer run about day and night to execute corvées imposed by a merciless taskmaster. Our mouths are opened; heretofore silent, or employed only in addressing useless supplications to our tormentors, they now celebrate a deliverance which we have sworn to accomplish, or else to perish. We invoke therefore the aid of all civilized nations of Europe, that we may the more promptly attain to the goal of a just and sacred enterprise, reconquer our rights, and regenerate our unfortunate people. Greece, our mother, was the lamp that illuminated you; on this ground she reckons on your philanthropy. Arms, money, and counsel, are what she expects from you. We promise you her lively gratitude, which she will prove by deeds in more prosperous times. (Signed) PETROS MAVROMIKHALIS Given at the head-quarters of Calamata, March 28/April 9, 1821.

As an undergraduate, Malouf worked on an archaeological dig in central Utah, which compelled him to obtain a master's degree in anthropology at the University of Utah. While working on his master's, Malouf met his wife Arline, and the couple was married in 1941. 50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. Military service during World War II interrupted Malouf's work on a doctorate in anthropology at Columbia University. During his service, the couple moved to various posts and stations in Utah, California, and Arizona. In 1946, Malouf was able to resume his doctoral studies at Columbia and he graduated 2 years later. Shortly after graduation in 1948, Malouf was offered a faculty position at the University of Montana in Missoula and he, Arline, and their four young children returned to the west. == Professional career == While at the University of Montana, Carling Malouf played a large role in the development of the departments of Anthropology and Native American Studies, and was chair of the department of Anthropology from 1969-1977. Malouf was an avid researcher in the fields of Archaeology, Ethnology, and Native American Studies. His primary research interests included Native American tribes of Montana, the Plains, and the greater Northwest, comparative ethnology, and archaeological sites in Montana, including Fort Owen. Malouf's involvement in anthropology and archaeology also extended outside of the University system. He was a supporter and a member of the board of directors of the Montana Archaeological Society, an organization devoted to promoting research and public involvement in archaeology in the state of Montana. Malouf contributed many articles to the Society's publication, “Archaeology in Montana”, from the years 1959-2000. Malouf was also involved in the development of the Head Start program. In 1960, he was a member of the Montana Child Welfare Committee, a group that made periodic reports to the White House regarding the state of education and youth in Montana. He became a consultant in Anthropology for Project Head Start for the Office of Economic Opportunity. In 1969, Malouf, along with 150 other education specialists, was invited to the White House to a conference for the development of the Head Start Program. Later, he and his wife toured reservations in Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming to provide information and ideas to administrators for the new programs. Malouf retired from the University of Montana in 1988 and was honored that same year at the Montana Archaeological Society's Annual Conference. Following his retirement, Malouf continued to do research and publish articles. Carling Malouf died March 21, 2007 at the age of 90. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Carling Malouf Oral History Project (University of Montana Archives) *Carling I.

Puerto Rico's territorial highway system is divided into four networks called primary, urban primary, secondary (inter-municipal), and tertiary (local). As a road or highway changes from being part of one network type to another network type, it maintains its same number but is then marked with a corresponding shield. The National Highway System roads are maintained by the Puerto Rico Department of Transportation and Public Works (, or DTOP). Puerto Rico's Interstate Highways, or the Puerto Rico Highway Program (PRHP), which are not signed, are partially funded by the US federal government, as Puerto Rico's citizens pay federal taxes. At one time, Puerto Rico was treated as a state for the remittance of federal-aid highway funds, but with TEA-21, a legislative act, \\"Puerto Rico no longer receives a share of the apportioned Federal-aid highway funds.

Municipalities are responsible for maintaining the roads within their jurisdictions, unsigned roads. The roads within municipalities have street names and street signs, not highway names with shields. There have been memorandums of agreement between the DTOP and the municipalities on road maintenance and also disagreements over who is the responsible entity for a road's maintenance. ==History== Isla Verde, near Puerto Rico's international airport Highways in Puerto Rico constructed by Spain by 1898 The first major routes in Puerto Rico were constructed under the Government of Spain before Puerto Rico was ceded to the United States. The of 22 of January in 1886, called the (English: Law of the highways of the island of Puerto Rico), was approved and described the highways of the island of Puerto Rico. The first highways of Puerto Rico were paved with macadam, a layer of crushed rock and cement. The highways were maintained by the , which translates to \\"walking workers\\". These workers lived, with their families, in casillas, buildings located along the highway. They were tasked with identifying when road repairs were needed. Following the system used in Spain, the buildings were spaced about apart and, each day the walked along their assigned highway stretch, the to the left and the three kilometers to the right of their home to visually inspect the road. Normally there were two families living in the , a worker, his apprentice, and their families. The Department of Public Works or was part of the Department of the Interior. Contests were held for which roads had been best maintained, so that workers could be recognized and rewarded. This system was very effective in maintaining the condition of roads, so that after the Treaty of Paris in 1898 when the United States assessed the roads of Puerto Rico, they found a road that was, by their own admission, the best in the Americas. They called Puerto Rico's Carretera Central \\"the finest road in the Western Hemisphere.\\" The U.S. also noted that, \\"As for roads, there are of all kinds. The State has built of roads, well made and in good shape. Of these, is the one from San Juan to Ponce with a branch from Cayey to Guayama. Most other roads in Puerto Rico are impassable except on horseback.\\" At the end of the 19th century, the roads mentioned were impassable by horse and carriage.

When the system was reestablished nine years later, the roads were again visually inspected daily until 1950, when the system was ended for good. In 1940, the United States was focused on improving the ability to handle the transportation of heavy equipment over roads and bridges to and from the military bases, with a focus on national defense. ==Roadway maintenance== PR-2 Puerto Rico Highway System roads, regardless of their network classification, are maintained by the centralized, commonwealth-level, Puerto Rico Department of Transportation and Public Works, known in Spanish as the or DTOP. Municipal governments are not responsible for maintenance of the Puerto Rico Highway System roads within their territory; whether or not the municipal government is an autonomous government, DTOP is the responsible agency. The DTOP maintains a network of regional offices throughout the island which carry out DTOP work within their multi-municipality region. On occasion, there have been disagreements over who is responsible for the maintenance of a specific road, like in the case after Hurricane Maria, when so many roads had been heavily damaged. Municipal governments are only responsible for maintenance of city and town streets within their jurisdictions. Sometimes the central government enters into a memorandum of agreement with municipal governments for the collaborative maintenance of a Puerto Rico Highway System roadway within their municipality. ==National Highway System== The National Highway System of Puerto Rico (not to be confused with the National Highway System of the United States) consists of of highway and roadways of four types: primary, urban primary, secondary, and tertiary. Cars going through a toll booth on PR-66 All Puerto Rico expressways are signed either primary or urban primary. Puerto Rico's controlled-access highway may be an expressway, an arterial highway with full or partial control of access. Expressways with full control of access are called freeways. If the freeway charges a toll for its use, it is called an . Most toll booths use the system for collecting tolls. In 2009, primary routes were about 14% of the total Puerto Rico Highway system mileage, secondary were about 30%, and tertiary about 56%. As a road or highway goes from being part of one network to another, it maintains its same number but is then marked with its new network shield type. An example of this is when PR-1, connecting Ponce and San Juan, is signed as urban primary inside the Ponce city limits, then is signed as secondary in Ponce's rural barrio Capitanejo, and then is signed as an urban primary road, on its entry into the town of Santa Isabel. This means that regardless of the amount of digits a road number may have, any road could be signed as primary network, urban primary network, secondary network or tertiary network all dependent on the area it goes through. ===Primary network highways=== Highway shield for primary section of PR-1 Primary roads are numbered in the 1 to 99 range and are distributed randomly throughout the island. The primary highway marker has a white background and a blue shield with white lettering. A primary road's purpose is to facilitate movement of passengers and freight between major regions of the island. PR-54 West and East junction with PR-744.jpgPR-54 West and East junction with PR-744 in Guayama ===Urban primary network highways=== Highway shield for urban primary section of PR-1 The purpose of urban primary highways are to complement the primary network inside the eight metro areas: San Juan, Ponce, Mayagüez, Arecibo, Aguadilla, Humacao, Caguas and Guayama. Some highways may be designated as R for Ramal, branch in Spanish, such as PR-2 which has several R designations along its length usually as a branch or loop that goes through the center of a town while the highway continues around and on to the next municipality. This is due to the fact that the original PR-2 went through every town center but these sections were bypassed and designated R to alleviate congestion. The urban primary marker has black lettering on a white shield over a black background. PR-1107P in Aguadilla barrio-pueblo ===Secondary network highways=== Highway shield for secondary section of PR-1 The secondary highways or roads provide access to municipalities from primary network roads. The secondary highway marker has yellow lettering on a blue shield with yellow trim. Because of Puerto Rico's mountainous terrain, some of its secondary highways can be dangerous. Puerto Rico Highway 172, a road that connects Caguas and Cidra municipalities, is an example of a highway with steep inclines alongside a precipice with unsafe barriers. There are times when drivers go over a barrier and fall from the road. Secondary roads are numbered in the 100 to 299 range and generally follow a grid pattern. They begin from the southwest portion of the island with PR-100 and increase in number in northeasterly fashion. PR-100 is located in the southwestern town of Cabo Rojo, while PR-198 is in Juncos, Las Piedras and Humacao in the eastern part of Puerto Rico. As of February 2014, the highest secondary highway number assigned was 252 (PR-252), located in the northeastern municipality-island of Culebra. PR-199 lies in Guaynabo and San Juan, not adhering to the pattern. For your safety, driving in Puerto Rico sign.jpg\\"For your safety\\" tips for driving in Puerto Rico sign Puerto Rico Highway 145 in Torrecillas, Morovis, Puerto Rico.jpgPR-145 in Torrecillas, Morovis ===Tertiary network highways=== Tertiary highways or roads provide access to a municipality's main urban area from peripheral communities. The tertiary highway marker has a white circle (white black lettering) on a black background. Roadways that have both their terminus within the same municipality are called tertiary roads and are, by convention, numbered PR-300 through PR-9999. The road marker in the shape of the island of Puerto Rico can also still be seen on some roadways. Three-digit tertiary roads right Tertiary highways also known as local highways, follow a general numbering pattern. The northern area in the region west of San Juan contains even-numbered roads, while the southern area contains odd-numbered ones. This changes in the region to the east of San Juan as both northern and southern areas are covered by roads of the 900-999 grid. The diagram illustrates the organization of these roads and may help better understand the distribution. Some roads may start or end among differently numbered areas like in Ciales, a mountainous municipality, it has highways in both the 600-699 grid and the 500-599 grid. Another example is in the southeastern municipality of Maunabo where the 700-799 grid overlaps the 900-999 grid. Vieques, an offshore island-municipality, has some highways in the 900-999 grid but also has roads in the 200-299 category that is shared with Culebra, another offshore island-municipality which has PR-250 and PR-251 as its main routes.

PR-438 Cuesta de Magos seen from Calabazas, San Sebastián, Puerto Rico.jpgPR-438, a steep roadway, seen from Calabazas, San Sebastián Barrio Espino, Lares, Puerto Rico, PR-435 junction with PR-124.jpgPR-435 and PR-124 highway junction in Espino, Lares Four-digit tertiary roads Some roads are numbered with four digits, for example, PR-5506. These are branches, or spurs, of tertiary roads by the same last three digit number. Thus, PR-5506 is a branch of PR-506. They are often dead end branches, and are common in the mountain regions of the main island. Sometimes they are loops branching off the main road, eventually connecting back to the same main tertiary road. The “fourth” digit is generally a repeat of the first digit of the main tertiary road in question. Thus, a branch of PR-301 would be signed PR-3301, with the added 3 prefixing the number of the main tertiary road associated with the spur, 301, because 3 is the first digit of the main road. When the road has more than one distinct spur, an additional unrelated digit is used (example, PR-4301).

Puerto Rico is an island so while there are no interstate highways in that highways have no direct land connections to any other states or territories, three roadways, PRI-1, PRI-2 and PRI-3, have an Interstate Highway designation for administrative and funding purposes. Unlike Interstate routes in Hawaii, Puerto Rico Interstate routes are unsigned. They are designated as such because they receive up to 90% of their funding from the Interstate Highway System. Residents of Puerto Rico pay federal fuel and tire taxes. As of 2007, none of the highways in Puerto Rico funded by the Interstate Highway program were built up to Interstate Highway standards. As of March 2001, Puerto Rico had of such roadways. PRI-1 is long, PRI-2 is long, and PRI-3 is long. They run along various combinations of Puerto Rico highways and do not follow the even-and-odd-number rule used in the mainland United States. Puerto Rico is exempt from following certain specifications for its Interstate Highway System. ==U.S. Forest Highway== Markers at the El Yunque National Rain Forest The El Yunque National Forest uses the Forest Highway road marker, a brown- colored, upside-down trapezoid with the words , (English: National Forest). This is a marker used along forest highways in the United States. ==Municipal roadways== Sign for Calle Pedro Albizu Campos in Lares barrio-pueblo In Puerto Rico, the municipal road is not a fifth network of the National Highway System of Puerto Rico. A municipal road or highway () refers to any public roadway that is not marked with a Puerto Rico National Highway network system road marker.¿Sabes cómo identificar si una carretera es estatal o municipal? Carlos M. Contreras-Aponte, Secretary of the Puerto Rico Department of Transportation and Public Works (DTOP). Departamento de Transportación y Obras Publicas de Puerto Rico. Published 28 August 2017. (Video series name: DTOP en Ruta; Date of video: Unknown). Accessed 2 May 2019. Unlike state roads, which are signed with numbers, municipal roads are signed with names, such as . Tertiary roads are not municipal roads even though the term municipal road has been used to refer to a tertiary state road. The confusion comes from the context in which the term is used. When the term municipal road occurs in the context of roads owned and maintained by the state government, municipal roads means tertiary state network roads. In this context, a municipal road and a state tertiary road both refer to the same network of state roads. However, if the term occurs in the context of roadways owned and maintained by a municipal government, it refers to the network of local streets and roadways that make up the urban landscape of a municipality. The purpose of a road can also indicate if a road is a \\"municipal road\\" or not. In its strictest sense, municipal roads are roads within a municipality's urban center providing access from one urban neighborhood to another urban neighborhood, within the same city, town or municipality. In the larger context of the state highway system, municipal roads refer to roads that “provide access to the main urban area of a municipality from peripheral communities” (that is, tertiary roads). Municipal roads are maintained by the municipality where the road occurs, while tertiary roads are maintained by the state government. As written under the section road maintenance, at times the state government has entered into a Memorandum of Agreement with municipal governments for the upkeep of a state tertiary roadway (note this is a state-owned road that runs entirely within a single municipality), but this does not make it a municipal road—the road continues to maintain its state signage and ownership. ==See also== * *List of highways in Ponce, Puerto Rico *1953 Puerto Rico highway renumbering ==ReferencesFurther reading== * ==External links== *Puerto Rico Road Photos ","title":"Roads in Puerto Rico"},{"id":"61302406","text":"Saint Gregory the Illuminator Cathedral may refer to: ;Armenia *Saint Gregory the Illuminator Cathedral, Yerevan ;Brazil *St. Gregory the Illuminator Cathedral, São Paulo ;Greece *St. Gregory the Illuminator Cathedral, Athens ;Lebanon *Cathedral of Saint Elias and Saint Gregory the Illuminator ;United States *St. Gregory the Illuminator Cathedral (Glendale, California) ","title":"Saint Gregory the Illuminator Cathedral"},{"id":"61302409","text":"The 1903 Campeonato Paulista, organized by the LPF (Liga Paulista de Football), was the 2nd season of São Paulo's top association football league.

Originally named the Nashville Brewing Company, which opened in 1859, the operation was purchased in 1890 and operated as the William Gerst Brewing Company.Scott R. Mertie, Nashville Brewing (Arcadia Publishing, 2006). The Nashville Brewing Company was occasionally renamed, with other company names including the Nashville Brewery, Stifel & Pfeiffer Brewery, South Nashville Lager Beer Brewery, and Moerlein-Gerst Brewing Company.\\"Past Explored Through Bottle Exhibit\\", The Daily News-Journal (Murfreesboro, Tennessee; August 31, 1989), p. 6. I 1893 it became the William Gerst Brewing Company, in a facility completely rebuilt on the same property, which remained in operation until the company closed in 1954. After the brewery closed, a German restaurant called the Gerst Haus was started by Gerst's grandson and operated in several locations from 1955 until 2018. Although the brewery has been closed for decades, Gerst Amber has been contract brewed by several different breweries since the 1990s. == History Foundation as Nashville Brewing Company (1859–1892)=== A sketch of the original Nashville Brewery as printed in 100 Years of Brewing (H.S. Rich & Company, Chicago, 1903). The city of Nashville, Tennessee was designated to be the capital of the state in 1843.Chris Chamberlain, Nashville Beer: A Heady History of Music City Brewing (The History Press; 2014), p. 6-9. This prompted a population boom, including a number of German immigrants who came to the area in the 1850s with a cultural preference for beer drinking, contributing to the growth of a market for beer that was more freshly brewed than the product that could typically be imported from other states. Among these immigrants was Jacob Stifel, who in 1859 opened a small brewery,\\"Nashville Brewery\\", Nashville Union and American (February 2, 1859). which would eventually become the Nashville Brewing Company, and which was \\"the first production brewery in Nashville\\". The company's facilities were initially located on South High Street, which later became Sixth Avenue South. Production was interrupted during the American Civil War, but the company resumed operations in 1864, with Stifel taking on Louis Pfeiffer as a business partner, and the brewery being renamed the South Nashville Brewery, as there was also a small brewery in North Nashville (Germantown) called the North Nashville Brewery.\\"South Nashville Brewery\\", Nashville Union and American (September 5, 1865). An 1873 news article referred to the brewery as a \\"mammoth establishment\\", being \\"of proportions much larger than one would suppose who had not visited it\\".\\"Nashville Lager: The Deepest Beer-Cellar in the Southern States\\", The Daily American (March 12, 1873). Pfeiffer died suddenly in April 1876, and the company was then sold in an auction. The purchaser was J.B. Kuhn, who took over its operations and changed the name to South Nashville Ale and Lager Beer Brewery. In 1878, Kuhn sold the company to C.A. Maus and Brothers, who in 1880 sold it to John Burkhardt. Burkhardt then changed the name to the Nashville Brewing Company. During one period in 1880, the company advertised an offer to pay $100 \\"to any person who can produce a better and purer quality of beer than we are now manufacturing in our brewery\\".The Tennessean (Nashville, Tennessee; February 29, 1880), p. 4. In 1882, Burkhardt entered into a partnership with two Scottish brothers from Cincinnati, William and Archibald Walker. The brothers bought complete control of the company from Burkhardt in 1885, but Archibald Walker died in 1889, prompting surviving brother William to convey ownership of the company again in 1890. === Ownership by Moerlein Brewing (1890-1892)=== Illustration of the Nashville Brewing Company from an 1891 advertisement, after it had been rebuilt by Moerlein-Gerst in 1890 In 1890, the business and the property were purchased by Christian Moerlein of Cincinnati, proprietor of the famous Christian Moerlein Brewing Co., and his apprentice William Gerst. The existing facility was razed, and Moerlein and Gerst initially planned to invest \\"between $250,000 and $500,000 into the Nashville Brewing Company\\", by their own account to \\"erect the finest and largest brewery in the whole Southern Country\\" on the property.Elizabeth K. Goetsch, Lost Nashville (2018), p. 110. The William Gerst Brewing Company about 1900 === Operations as Gerst Brewing (1893–1919) === In 1893, Gerst, who had moved to Nashville while Moerlein remained in Cincinnati, \\"assumed sole operations\\", changing the name of the company to the William Gerst Brewing Company. The brewery continued its success in Nashville and won the Gold Award at the Tennessee Centennial Exposition of 1897. By the turn of the century, the brewery was considered one of the largest in the South. William Gerst was viewed as a prominent citizen of Nashville and got into race horses as a hobby. In 1910, his horse Donau was the Kentucky Derby. === Prohibition (1919–1933) === Unfortunately, the Temperance Movement was strong in Tennessee and the brewery was forced to market lower alcohol beers. By 1913, the state went dry, six years before National Prohibition. William Gerst retired and moved back to Cincinnati, where his wife's family lived. Gerst's four sons continued operations by making non-alcoholic malt beverages and other sodas, such as Orange Crush under the Gerst Bottling Company under the name Gerst Bottling Works. William Gerst died on March 10, 1933, shortly before the end of Prohibition. He is buried at the Spring Grove Cemetery in Cincinnati. === Post-Prohibition (1933–1954) === After the repeal of Prohibition in 1933, the William Gerst Brewing Company started brewing beer again. In 1940, the brewery had a large 50 year anniversary (1890-1940) marketing campaign featuring a large \\"Gay 90's\\" parade through Nashville. However, the brewery would never see the success it had prior to prohibition. Due to national advertising budgets of larger breweries, the William Gerst Brewing Company closed in 1954. === The Gerst Haus restaurants (1955–2018) === The first Gerst House (1955-1970) in 1955, a year after the closing of the brewery, William Gerst's grandson, William J. (Bill) Gerst bought the M&A; Café in downtown Nashville. The restaurant, which its name changed to the Gerst House, was located at 315 Second Ave North, near the Courthouse. It was a popular lunchtime spot for lawyers and politicians, serving deli-style sandwiches and oyster rolls. William J. Gerst died November 12, 1968, leaving the restaurant to his daughter, Gene Gerst Ritter (great-granddaughter of William Gerst) and her husband Eugene Ritter. The couple was known as Gene and Gene. In 1970, the Ritters moved the restaurant across the Cumberland River to 228 Woodland Street. By this time it was known as the Gerst Haus, serving traditional German food in addition to its regular menu. The Gerst Haus was decorated with original lithographs and other advertising pieces from the William Gerst Brewing Company. The restaurant continued to be a favorite among Nashvillians with beer served in \\"fishbowls\\" and German oompah and polka entertainment on the weekends. In 1988, ownership of the Gerst Haus was sold to brothers Jim and Jerry Chandler. The Chandlers owned several other restaurants in the Nashville area including the Sportsman's Grille. The Chandlers operated the Gerst Haus in Nashville until the football stadium was constructed for the Tennessee Titans. At that time in 1999, the Chandlers opened the Gerst Bavarian Haus in Evansville, Indiana, where they were having their Gerst Amber contracted brewed. Mary Hance of the Tennessean says that Gerst House was best known \\"for was its fishbowls of beer and the German food — Bratwurst, Bavarian pizza, kielbasa and pumpernickel bread, Reuben sandwiches, oyster rolls, and pig knuckles.\\" There were beer boys serving beer while waitresses served food orders. The Gerst Haus reopened in August 2000 in its third location, 301 Woodland Street, across from the new Tennessee Titan's stadium. The Gerst Haus would operate in this location until March 2018, when it permanently closed due to slow sales. The Evansville Gerst Bavarian Haus continues to operate. === Gerst Amber Beer (1992–present) === Gerst Amber Labels- Amber Export Beer (circa 1900) In the early 1990s, the Chandler brothers, who owned the Gerst Haus at the time, contracted with the Evansville Brewing Company to brew Gerst Haus Premium Amber to be sold at the restaurant. This was an amber lager loosely based on Gerst Old Amber Premium Beer that was originally released in 1950. Due to the success of the beer sales at the Gerst Haus, the Chandlers decided to have the beer bottled for retail sale in 1992 and marketed it as Gerst Amber for sales in Nashville TN and Evansville IN. The Evansville Brewing Company eventually closed and their brands were sold to the Pittsburg Brewing Company. The Chandlers contracted with the Pittsburg Brewing Co. to continue brewing Gerst Amber. The beer was only available on draft at the Gerst Haus and other restaurants operated by the Chandler brothers in Nashville and Evansville. Eventually the Pittsburg Brewing Co declared bankruptcy and production of Gerst Amber once again ceased. In 2011, the Chandlers contracted with Yazoo Brewing Company and to bring Gerst back to Nashville. Gerst Amber Ale was developed and brewed by Yazoo to be sold in bottles and draft in the Nashville market. Being an ale, the beer has its differences from the original Amber lager brewed by Gerst, as well as the ones brewed by the Evansville and Pittsburg Brewing Companies. The current label design is based on an original pre-prohibition label that was used by Gerst in the early 1900s. == Cultural impact and research== The front and back of the Nashville Brewery Historical Marker located in Nashville, Tennessee In 2006, local businessman and historian Scott R. Mertie (owner of the Nashville Brewing Company) wrote a book on Nashville's brewing history, titled Nashville Brewing (Arcadia Publishing, 2006). The book spanned from the early 19th century to the modern day micro-breweries in Nashville, but the majority of the book was about the life of William Gerst and his brewery. In 2011, Mertie coordinated with the Metro-Nashville Historical Commission to erect a Historical Marker where the Nashville Brewing Company/Gerst Brewing Company once operated. In May 2019, Mertie and Vanderbilt University anthropology professor John Janusek used ground-penetrating radar to map the area beneath downtown Nashville's 6th Avenue South, in an attempt to locate tunnels and cellars thought to have been used by the original Nashville Brewing Company, and its successor, the William Gerst Brewing Company. The results of that search will determine whether the Vanderbilt University anthropology department will begin an archaeological excavation. ==References== Category:Beer brewing companies based in Tennessee Category:Companies based in Nashville, Tennessee Category:1890 establishments in Tennessee Category:American companies established in 1859 ","title":"Gerst Brewing Company"},{"id":"61302525","text":"The Kentucky Housewife title page Lettice Pierce Bryan (1805–1877) was an American author, who wrote The Kentucky Housewife, a cookbook originally published in 1839. == Life == Bryan was born in central Kentucky, probably near Danville, to James A.

Sherburne left school when he was 15 years old and moved to Minnesota to work with his uncle on the state's first railroad. Sometime between 1866 and 1876 Sherburne relocated to Arkansas City, Kansas, working as a druggist, miller, and storekeeper. While working as a shopkeeper in Arkansas City, he began trading with multiple tribal groups in Oklahoma to acquire buffalo hides. He then sold the hides in St. Louis, Missouri. 50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. In 1876 Sherburne established a trading post, under federal license, to solidify his business relations with the Ponca and other Indian tribes in the Oklahoma Territory. In 1879, Joseph Sherburne married Gertrude Lockley. The Sherburnes began their family in the Oklahoma Territory but encountered several hardships in operating the trading post. After the failure of a cattle ranching venture, Joseph temporarily moved back to Arkansas City and opened both real estate and insurance businesses to pay off his debts. The following spring he sold his land interests in the Oklahoma Territory to a larger ranching operation, subcontracting to process and market their beef for Indian agencies throughout the region. Joseph Sherburne continued to conduct various trading operations with the Indian tribes of the Oklahoma Territory until 1895. Joseph Sherburne made several trips to Montana and eventually decided to relocate his family and business interests to the Blackfeet Reservation. At the time James and Joseph Kipp, Blackfeet tribal members, owned and operated a general store in Browning, Montana. The Kipps' business closed late in 1895 and Joseph Sherburne established a trading post and general store at Browning in the spring of 1896. Gertrude Sherburne and their six children, Joseph Lockely VIII, Frank Ponca, Hazel, Arthur, Agnes and Theodosia, arrived at Browning in June, but only remained in Montana for the summer months. Though Joseph Sherburne hired his nephew, Walter Shepard, to serve as a temporary schoolteacher until a formal schoolhouse in Browning could be built, Mrs. Sherburne relocated the children to a family house in Minneapolis, Minnesota every school year until the early 1900s. She and the children spent their summers in Montana. Under Joseph Sherburne's leadership the Sherburne Mercantile Company grew to be the economic and social center of Browning. The thriving business included real estate, banking, telephone communications, and Northern Pacific Railway commissary supply. The Northern Pacific line had been completed in 1891. The Sherburne Mercantile \\"loan department\\" and its assets served as the foundation for the First National Bank of Browning, opened in 1917. Joseph Sherburne was also heavily involved with mineral and oil speculation along the Rocky Mountain eastern front range of Montana. He was an officer of the Swift Current Oil, Land, and Power Company. This company achieved the first successful oil drilling operation in Montana, located in the Swift Current Valley near the lake now known as Sherburne Lake. The Sherburne Mercantile also opened branch stores in Babb, Montana, and in the newly designated Glacier National Park. The majority of Park lands were formerly part of the Blackfeet Reservation and were purchased by the U.S. government in the 1895, justified partly in response to mining claim pressures and partly to supplement the economic resources of the Blackfeet tribe. Both Joseph and Gertrude Sherburne were actively involved in Browning society and used the mercantile as a meeting place. Browning's first school was established in the Sherburne's home, which was attached to the Mercantile. Gertrude organized Montana's first Red Cross chapter in 1917 and participated in numerous civic events and organizations. Joseph was an active Montana Republican Party supporter and was a member of the Masons. Both were very active in the local Presbyterian Church. Gertrude Lockley Sherburne died in Browning in 1935. Joseph Herbert Sherburne died in Browning on September 11, 1938 at the age of 87. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Joseph H.

There was no story, only words dropped in the air like cylinders of tear gas. Words for the sake of words, words for the sake of beauty, words for the sake of half-forgotten associations, phrases acting, Proust-like, opening doors of lost perception. And, oh yes, it was hilariously funny.\\" Concerning the music, Barnes said: \\"Mr. Carmines must eat music in the morning instead of breakfast cereal, rather as Gertrude Stein once must have eaten words. His music is arrogantly eclectic, disgracefully tuneful and just right for the purpose. Influences of Verdi, Bizet, barbershop quartet, Weill, ragtime, spirituals and obviously all that jazz, float around in his music with happen unconcern about being influential. His music seems to know the nicest people, and it introduces them at the drop of a temperature.\\" The Variety critic was somewhat skeptical. \\"In Circles is not a play in the traditional sense. It's a free-form, free-associative, uninhibited, stylized series of fragments of language and music, more a succession of abstract setting exercises than a cohesive dramatic work. Accordingly, it requires a specialized taste to enjoy...The overall impression is a mixture of chi-chi obscurity and clever, tantalizing use of language.\\" The critic did have positive words for the direction: \\"Lawrence Kornfeld's staging is impressive. He controls the flowing movement at all times.Humm., \\"Off-Broadway Review: In Circles,\\" Variety (December 13, 1967), p. 59. After transferring in June 1968, critic Dan Sullivan wrote that the show \\"remains one of the most delightful shows in New York.\\"Dan Sullivan, \\"Another Delightful Look at 'In Circles,' a Drama of Obfuscation,\\" New York Times (June 28, 1968), p. 36. After a brief comparison to the musical Hair, he continued: \\"'In Circles' is adventurous but polite. It wants to be liked.\\" Sullivan attributed the show's success to Carmine's music and especially to Lawrence Kornfeld's direction. \\"By imposing an ever-moving and ever-interesting pattern of feeling of Miss Stein's apparent nonsense, Mr. Kornfeld gives the play shape and even an unspoken moral: that the words we use in talking with each other are almost ludicrously dependent on gesture and tone of voice for their emotional significance. By temporarily divorcing words from their meanings, In Circles also lets us revel in Miss Stein's words simply as pure sounds.\\" Writing in The New Yorker, Edith Oliver remarked on Carmine's music: \\"The songs, all by Mr. Carmines, vary from popular numbers and blues to gospel songs and Moonlight Sonata-ish Beethoven. This clever, tuneful music, which falls somewhere between parody and pastiche and yet is not quite either one, is entirely in keeping, and so are the dancing and tableaux and vaudeville and musical-comedy routines by Lawruence Kornfeld, the director.\\" Oliver continued: \\"The characters belong together, yet each belongs to himself, and the actors who play them manage to be just anonymous enough, without ever quite losing their separate identities...they all catch the spirit of the show and never lose it.\\" Oliver concludes: \\"Miss Stein's quirky lines glitter with meaning—for everybody. They are, of course, terribly funny, and the comedy is rooted in wisdom and poetry and pureheartedness. Non sequitur they may be but never nonsense. There is nothing trivial or silly here, and there is always the awareness that tragedy is just a hairbreadth away. ==Recordings== The original cast recording was released in 1968 on Avant-Garde Records, record number AV 108. ==References== Category:Off-Broadway musicals Category:1967 musicals Category:Obie Award recipients Category:Musicals based on plays ","title":"In Circles (musical)"},{"id":"61302748","text":"Birth Defects Research is a peer-reviewed academic journal of birth defects published by Wiley on behalf of the Teratology Society.

In March 2018 the dispute gained public attention through social networks – with the hashtag #YaPágameINBA (Pay Me Already, INBA) – because the staff hired for fees had not received the payments corresponding to January and February of that year, and because this was a recurrent practice of the institute. On Monday, March 26, 2018, the INBA workers hired through Chapter 3000 held a work stoppage at several museums. The protest went viral and attracted the attention of various media outlets after the publication of a tweet from the official account of the Museo Nacional de Arte (MUNAL) denouncing the lack of payment. Later that day, a group of around 70 people demonstrated peacefully outside the Palacio de Bellas Artes, with placards demanding the improvement of their working conditions. Given the media and social pressure, INBA authorities agreed to meet with Chapter 3000 workers. In this meeting, INBA agreed to settle the debts and establish a punctual payment schedule – a promise which they failed to uphold in May. They also declared themselves incapable of resolving the labor crisis, arguing that the hiring schemes are established by the Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit. They also stated that INBA is governed by the Acquisitions, Leases, and Public Sector Services Law and not the .

The FDA said that there was an increase in the use of opioids because physicians were not treating \\"chronic non-cancer pain\\" adequately. * 1952 Mortimer David Sackler (1916–2010) and Raymond became the co-chairmen of a small Greenwich Village-based pharmaceutical company financed by their brother Arthur.

Goldenheim MD - who later became Purdue's chief medical officer - published in the Journal of Clinical Pharmacology reported that the controlled-release (CR) formulation - by mouth - had a variable duration of action ranging from 10–12 hours.

In an August 24, 2001 taped-interview with three top Purdue executives, CEO Michael Friedman, Howard Udell and Dr. Paul Goldenheim, the executives told Meier that \\"they had learned of OxyContin's growing abuse only in early 2000, a statement they also made before congressional committees\\". *2001 The number of prescriptions of OxyContin rose to more than 14 million in 2001 and 2002 up from 316, 000 prescriptions in 1996.

Toy manufacturer Edwin S. Lowe originally opened the 450-room Tallyho Hotel on the property in 1962. The Tallyho was the only major hotel in Nevada to not include a casino; it closed at the end of the year and was sold to Kings Crown Inns of America, a hotel chain which reopened the property a month later as the King's Crown Tallyho. The company added a casino and showroom but plans to open the casino were halted when the Nevada Gaming Control Board declined to issue a gambling license because of concerns about the resort being inadequately financed. Milton Prell purchased the hotel and began an extensive $3 million renovation of the property before reopening it as the Aladdin on April 1, 1966. A 19-story hotel tower was added in 1976. After various ownership changes, the Aladdin was closed in 1997 and demolished the following year to make room for a new Aladdin resort that opened in 2000. ==HistoryTallyho (1962–1963)=== The English Tudor-styled Tallyho hotel was conceived by owner Edwin S. Lowe, a New York toy manufacturer who also served as the president of the hotel. Lowe, who believed that there were some Las Vegas tourists who were not interested in gambling, chose not to add a casino to the Tallyho. The hotel was built on the Las Vegas Strip, across the street from the Dunes resort. Construction of the Tallyho was underway in March 1962, with an opening planned for July. In May 1962, the Clark County Ground Water Board denied an application for a water well that would be used for a nine-hole pitch and putt golf course, which Lowe planned to construct at the rear of the property. A nine-hole golf course was ultimately added to the final plans. In June 1962, the hotel's opening was delayed until October 1, 1962. Simultaneously, county officials discovered that the three-story stucco hotel may be in violation of fire codes. A request was made for the owner to propose plans to fireproof the hotel's wooden roof and attic. County officials suggested the installation of either a sprinkler system or sheet rock in the attic, as well as the addition of fire-proof materials on the roof of the hotel structures. In November 1962, key positions in the resort were being named while an opening date of Christmas week was being planned. The Tallyho Hotel and Country Club opened on December 24, 1962, at a cost of $12 million. Grand opening celebrations were held in February 1963. It was the only major resort in Nevada to not include a casino. The hotel featured 450 rooms, 32 villas, six restaurants, horseback and bicycle-riding facilities, and a helicopter service to take guests to nearby attractions such as Mount Charleston and Lake Mead. Despite the lack of a casino, the business was operating successfully at the time of its opening. However, the Tallyho closed on October 10, 1963, because of low revenue caused by the lack of a casino. The closure affected 100 employees, and Lowe conceded that it was a mistake to not open the hotel with an adjoining casino. ===King's Crown Tallyho (1963–1966)=== Kings Crown Inns of America, Incorporated, a chain of hotels, purchased the Tallyho at a cost of $7 million, and reopened it as the King's Crown Tallyho on November 5, 1963. Kings Crown planned to add a casino and showroom as soon as possible. The Tallyho was Kings Crown's first hotel in the western United States. Lighting and sound system details for the showroom were being finalized in March 1964, while Kings Crown planned to have the showroom opened in the summer. Sound men who designed the showroom consulted with sound engineers at the University of California, Los Angeles. Film producer Steve Parker, husband of actress Shirley MacLaine, was named as the head of the hotel's showroom, to be named the Crown Room Theater-Restaurant. In addition, Parker was named as a part owner in the resort. In April 1964, a fire started in one of the hotel rooms and caused smoke damage to part of the hotel. The fire was believed to have been started by a cigarette. Groundbreaking ceremonies for the casino and showroom were scheduled for the weekend of April 11–12, 1964. Celebrities, including MacLaine, were expected to attend the ceremonies. Other additions in the $3 million expansion project would include a convention hall and another restaurant. Future plans included the addition of a 15-story hotel structure with 500 rooms. Construction of the casino and showroom was underway in May 1964, while Parker was planning a show that would feature non-topless showgirls, a concept that was not present in other showgirl shows in Las Vegas. By the end of 1964, a partnership of six corporations, with a total of 17 stockholders, was seeking a gambling license to open the casino as part of a $500,000 investment. On December 22, 1964, the Nevada Gaming Control Board deferred action on the approval of a gambling license until the following month to allow time for an investigation of the partnership's finances. A New Year's Eve opening date had been planned for the casino, while the possibility remained for a showroom lounge and two new restaurants to open at that time, although they ultimately did not. A total of 500 people were expected to be employed at the resort's new facilities. In January 1965, the Gaming Board considered the request for a gambling license, but agreed to the hotel's request to delay action for another 30 days so financial agreements could be worked out between people in the partnership. By that time, the partnership consisted of 18 people with a total investment of $800,000. In February 1965, as the Gaming Board was considering the issuance of a gambling license, the hotel submitted multiple partnership changes that would include increasing Parker's ownership from eight percent to twenty percent. The Gaming Board deferred action on the gambling license until the following month. Board member W. E. Leypoldt said, \\"I don't think it's fair to ask us to act on something that's entirely different from what was presented Monday. It would do the casino industry a great deal of harm if you opened and in six months went broke because of lack of financing.\\" The request for a gambling license was withdrawn in March 1965, to allow more time to reorganize the partnership. Later that month, a suit was filed by Kings Crown Tallyho Inn Incorporated, Equitable Real Estate Investment Trust, and Fidelity Real Estate Investment Trust, all of which requested that the present leasees of the hotel be removed for not paying $632,000 in rent and other payments. The companies stated that other groups were interested in taking over the resort as soon as the leasees, including Chuck Luftig and Edward Nealis, could be removed. Phone service to the hotel was cut off in April 1965, due to unpaid phone bills dating back to January. All 50 non-permanent guests were asked to leave the hotel. Luftig and Nealis were removed as lessees at the end of the month, after a judge ruled that the hotel be vacated and returned to Kings Crown. The next month, Luftig and Nealis asked for a $3.3 million judgment, alleging that Kings Crown failed to finish necessary improvements to the property during the period of August 1964 to January 1965, leading to financial losses. ===Aladdin (1966–1998)=== The original Aladdin's Lamp in 2008, now part of the Neon Museum On January 1, 1966, Milton Prell agreed to purchase the King's Crown Tallyho, which was owned by three trusts overseen by the Cook brothers of Indiana. Prell agreed to purchase the resort for $10 million, which would be delivered in monthly payments. Prell announced plans to remove the old English theme and reopen the resort as the Oriental-themed Aladdin on April 16 following an extensive $3 million renovation. Prell also planned to construct a $20 million, 40-story hotel addition with 600 rooms. Construction of the high-rise was expected to begin later in the year. Martin Stern Jr. was the architect for the Aladdin project, while R. C. Johnson and Associates was the contractor and was hired to construct new facilities and renovate existing structures. Renovation plans included the remodeling of the showroom and lounge, as well as the casino and the hotel's front side. Elevators and escalators were also installed at the hotel's two main front entrances. The original English-themed room wings were kept, but received an Arabian Nights theme along with the rest of the resort. The Aladdin was named after the character of the same name. A serrated canopy was added along with a $750,000, 15-foot \\"Aladdin's Lamp\\" sign. Two weeks after Prell took over the property, a new opening date of April 1 was announced due to the fast progress of renovations, while construction of the high-rise was expected to begin in the fall. Later in the month, Prell requested a gambling license to operate 27 table games and 350 slot machines, with casino operations to be financed at a cost of $400,000 through Prell and his partners, Gil Gilbert and Sidney Krystal. Prell owned a 20-percent interest in the hotel corporation, while Gilberts, the corporate vice president, held five percent and Krystal, secretary-treasurer, had seven percent. A large group of investors owned the remaining stock. Prell named Joe Rollo and Bernie Richards, both of Beverly Hills, to serve as entertainment director and head of orchestrations respectively. The Gaming Board recommended approval of Prell's request for a gambling license in February 1966. Prell was approved the next month for gaming and liquor licenses, with approval to operate 351 slot machines and 29 table games. Opening and ownership changes The resort opened as Milton Prell's Aladdin at midnight on April 1, 1966, becoming the first major resort to open on the Las Vegas Strip in nine years. The Aladdin included the largest casino on the Las Vegas Strip and the 500-seat Bagdad Theatre. People present at the grand opening included Prell and his wife, as well as County Commission Chairman William H. Briare, Las Vegas mayor Oran K. Gragson, and Las Vegas Sun publisher Hank Greenspun. The Aladdin, located on , included a golf course and five dining facilities. A week after opening, the sign for the Dunes casino welcomed the Aladdin and wished the new resort \\"good luck.\\" The Aladdin was considered one of the most luxurious resorts on the Las Vegas Strip, although profits were usually low. Construction of the high-rise hotel addition was scheduled to begin in October 1966. In September 1966, nine people – including Prell's daughter Sheila – were approved to invest $287,500 for a combined 11.5 percent interest in the Aladdin. At the end of 1966, Prell stopped making payments to the trusts, stating he could not afford the overall $10 million sale price. The trusts agreed to reduce the sale price to $5 million, and Prell's purchase of the property was completed on February 9, 1967. Prell Hotel Corporation was the new owner. In May 1967, the Aladdin was host to Elvis and Priscilla Presley's wedding. In 1968, MK Investment Corporation made a failed offer to purchase the Aladdin. Renovations totaling $750,000 were completed in August 1969, which included making the Sinbad Lounge enclosed and leveled above the casino floor with Arabic motif. In 1969, Parvin Dohrmann Corporation took over the Aladdin, and the company was renamed as Recrion Corporation. In February 1971, a group led by Las Vegas resident Walter Gardner agreed to purchase the Aladdin at a cost of $16.5 million. The sale was to be completed once the new owners received licensing to operate the Aladdin's casino. Recrion's agreement with Gardner required that the sale be completed by May 15, 1971. Gardner was a former executive at the Binion's Horseshoe in downtown Las Vegas, and his group included six unnamed investors. In May 1971, Recrion granted the group an extension in order to raise the money to complete the purchase. The deal was cancelled later in the month after Gardner failed to make the purchase, which resulted in Recrion filing a $250,000 suit against Gardner. By the end of 1971, Recrion was planning a $5 million sale of the Aladdin, which would help pay off the resort's debts. The Aladdin was sold to Sam Diamond, St. Louis politicians Peter Webbe and Sorkis Webbe, and St. Louis attorney Richard L. Daly for $5 million. The new owners announced plans for the $25 million, 24-story, 800-room Regency Tower, to be built adjacent to the Aladdin and expected to be opened in late 1973. Under the new owners, a $60 million face lift was conducted, including the addition of a 17-story tower and the new 7,500-seat Performing Arts Center replacing the golf course, which was $4 million over budget. Construction began on the 19 story \\"Tower of Majesty\\" in May 1975. It was designed by Lee Linton, and built by the Del E. Webb Corporation. The tower opened on June 1, 1976. Neil Diamond performing at the Aladdin Theatre for the Performing Arts on July 2, 1976 A $250,000 porte-cochere continued the tower's arabesques. The Aladdin added a new $300,000 blockbuster sign with little neon, huge attraction panels and none of the arabesque of the Aladdin's original sign. The Aladdin celebrated the grand opening of their new \\"Aladdin Theatre for the Performing Arts\\" with singer Neil Diamond being paid $650,000 for four shows; July 2 through July 5, 1976. In 1981, heavy metal band Iron Maiden played at the Aladdin – it was their first ever concert in America. In August 1979, several individuals were convicted by a Detroit Federal Jury of conspiring to allow hidden owners to exert control over the resort, and the Nevada Gaming Commission then closed the hotel. The resort was sold to Wayne Newton and Ed Torres in 1980 for $85 million, snubbing an offer from comedian Johnny Carson. Newton sold his share to Torres 21 months later. Newton sued NBC, who had alleged in broadcasts, that his purchase of the Aladdin was tied to the mafia. He won a $22.8 million judgement, which was overturned on appeal. In February 1984, the Aladdin went into Chapter 11 bankruptcy. In 1986, Japanese businessman Ginji Yasuda purchased the Aladdin out of bankruptcy for $54 million. Yasuda spent an additional $35 million to refurbish the resort. Yasuda was removed as the casino's operator by state regulators in September 1988. Yasuda placed the resort in Chapter 11 bankruptcy in October 1989, and died two months later. The property was publicly put up for sale in 1990, after months of unsuccessful private attempts to locate a buyer. The New Jersey-based Bell Atlantic-Tricon Leasing Corporation acquired the resort out of bankruptcy from Ginji Corporation in 1991. That year, Bell Atlantic-Tricon put the property up for sale at a minimum price of $44 million. In January 1994, businessman Donald Trump considered purchasing the Aladdin for $51 million, although Bell Atlantic-Tricon declined to sell the property for less than $60 million. Trump decided not to purchase the Aladdin as he felt the price was too high. Interest in the property increased following the news of Trump's potential purchase, with several prospective buyers emerging. At the time, the resort consisted of a 1,000-room hotel and a 37,000 square-foot casino. Later in 1994, Jack Sommer, a Las Vegas real estate developer, and the Sommer Family Trust purchased the hotel. The Sommer Family Trust owned the Aladdin through Aladdin Gaming Corporation – which also operated the resort – and Aladdin Holdings LLC. A pair of endangered peregrine falcons nested on the hotel tower during the mid-1990s. In May 1996, plans were approved by the Clark County Commission for a $600 million renovation and expansion of the Aladdin, which had 1,100 hotel rooms at the time. Sommer and the county spent six months working on the design of the project, which would retain the original hotel tower and theater. The expansion would include four new hotel towers, including a centerpiece 400-foot-high rectangular tower. Other additions would include a 256-room timeshare condominium, a 300-room hotel- casino, and a shopping mall that would be co-managed by Eddie DeBartolo. The hotel would continue operations during the expansion project, which was expected to take 24 to 30 months. On December 6, 1996, American psychedelic rock band Phish performed at the Aladdin, marking the first appearance in Las Vegas by the band. The performance was ultimately released as a CD/DVD release entitled Vegas 96. The concert featured a guest appearance by members of the band Primus and a group of Elvis impersonators. In January 1997, Aladdin Gaming Corporation announced that London Clubs International would invest $50 million for a 25 percent interest in the Aladdin resort. London Clubs planned to add a luxury gaming facility to the Aladdin, aimed at attracting high rollers. The new facility would include 30 gaming tables and 100 slot machines. It would be part of the two-year renovation and expansion project, which was expected to cost $750 million and was scheduled to begin later in 1997. The new gaming facility would feature a European design. The Aladdin had been struggling to compete against larger resorts on the Las Vegas Strip. In March 1997, Aladdin Holdings announced that the resort would add a shopping mall as part of the expansion project. It would feature the Aladdin's Arabian theme and was expected to open in 1999, with TrizecHahn Corporation handling construction, leasing, and operations. The mall, to be known as Desert Passage, was expected to cost $210 million. For the expansion project, Jack Sommer considered various options, which included closing the resort to renovate it, and demolishing the resort entirely to build a new one. Closure and demolition On September 25, 1997, it was announced that the Aladdin would close in two months and eventually be demolished to make room for a new Aladdin resort that would be three times larger than the original, and would include the Desert Passage mall. The Aladdin had 1,485 employees, while the new resort would employ over 7,000 people. The Aladdin's 7,000-seat Theater for the Performing Arts would be retained and modernized for the new resort. Among the final performances in the Aladdin theater was Jane's Addiction. The Aladdin closed at 6:00 p.m. on November 25, 1997. Few casino guests expressed sadness about the closure. The Aladdin theater hosted its final performance later that night, with a show by Mötley Crüe. The performance turned chaotic when the band encouraged the audience to stand up, as one person tried to grab the hat worn by guitarist Mick Mars, accidentally knocking him down. Demolition was expected to begin in December 1997, and an implosion of the hotel tower was expected to occur in February 1998. The Aladdin's porte cochere contained 9,230 light bulbs, which cost a total of $23,499 to light up during 1997. In February 1998, Aladdin Gaming announced that it had financed plans for the new Aladdin resort, expected to cost $826 million. National Content Liquidators conducted an on-site liquidation sale of the Aladdin beginning on March 6, 1998. On April 27, 1998, the hotel tower was imploded at 7:27 p.m. to make way for construction of the new Aladdin resort. It was the fifth Las Vegas resort to be imploded. The tower was imploded by Controlled Demolition, Inc. According to company president Mark Loizeaux, the tower used a poor concrete block design. He said, \\"This is the worst construction I've ever seen. It's shoddy. It's a poor man's high-rise. It is extremely susceptible to collapse. It is not a building I'd want to be in in an earthquake.\\" The design meant that bringing down the tower in the implosion would be easy, but it also posed a challenge for getting the building to come down in the right direction. Because the tower would be easy to bring down during the implosion, Loizeaux decreased the amount of explosives from 370 pounds to 232 pounds. An estimated 20,000 people arrived to watch the implosion from nearby. Aladdin executives set up a 1,000-person tent near the Aladdin and charged $250 a ticket for people to watch the implosion from inside the tent, with the proceeds benefiting the Make-A-Wish Foundation of Southern Nevada. The old resort's sign read, \\"Out of the dust Aladdin rises anew. See you in 2000.\\" Frank Wright, the curator of the Nevada State Museum, said about the Aladdin's lack of success: \\"I don't know why it never made it. It never had the glamour of the Sands or the exotic dancers of the Tropicana or the Dunes or Stardust. Maybe it was location, but the Hacienda was farther out, and it was a success.\\" Don Payne, the former chief of the Las Vegas News Bureau, said the Aladdin \\"certainly couldn't match the Flamingo or the Dunes. It never had the big name entertainment policy. It didn't have the advertising the big guys had. But it was a well-thought-of place.\\" ===New resort (2000–present)=== The new Aladdin in 2005 before being rebranded as Planet Hollywood The new Aladdin resort opened in August 2000. It experienced financial problems and entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in September 2001. In February 2002, Aladdin Gaming was searching for potential buyers. The resort was sold in bankruptcy on June 20, 2003 to a partnership of Planet Hollywood and Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide. After a renovation, the resort began operating in 2007 under the name \\"Planet Hollywood\\". ==Film history== Robert Hirsch, a Las Vegas location consultant and the former director of the Nevada Motion Picture Division, said that film and television crews \\"always loved the porte cochere\\" of the Aladdin, but that they \\"just didn't like the rest of the place.\\" The Aladdin's casino was featured substantially in the 1979 film Going in Style and the 1986 film Heat. The porte cochere and casino appeared in the 1993 film, Best of the Best II, while the theatre appeared in the 1997 documentary film, Dancing for Dollars. Behind Closed Doors, a documentary series, shot footage of the hotel tower's demolition preparations prior to its implosion. The series also placed cameras inside the tower to give an interior view of the building during the implosion. The Aladdin was also featured in a 1998 episode of Ohh Nooo! Mr. Bill Presents, in which the character of Mr. Bill performs at the resort. Footage of the implosion was used in the closing credits of the 2003 film The Cooler. ==See also== * List of casinos in Nevada ==References== Category:1962 establishments in Nevada Category:Casino hotels Category:Casinos in the Las Vegas Valley Category:Defunct casinos in the Las Vegas Valley Category:Defunct hotels in the Las Vegas Valley Category:Demolished hotels in Clark County, Nevada Category:Demolished hotels in the United States Category:1997 disestablishments in Nevada Category:Buildings and structures demolished in 1998 Category:Las Vegas Strip Category:Resorts in the Las Vegas Valley Category:Del E.

Petros Christou (, 1887 - 21 June 1908) was a Greek chieftain of the Macedonian Struggle. == Biography == Christou was born in 1887 in Velušina, then Ottoman Empire (now North Macedonia). He served as a teacher in Gradešnica. Later, he joined the armed group of Cretan G. Volanis, where he was distinguished for his leadership abilities. He also collaborated with G. Dikonomos Makris. In May 1906 he formed his own armed group that acted in Mariovo against the Bulgarian komitadjis and Ottoman military detachments, cooperating with the chieftain Simos Ioannidis.Κωνσταντίνος Αποστόλου Βακαλόπουλος, Ο ένοπλος αγώνας στη Μακεδονία 1904-1908, publications Ηρόδοτος, Thessaloniki, 1999, p. 291 - 349 Later, he collaborated with Georgios Tsontos, acting in southern Mariovo and in the region of Florina and Prespa. At the end of May 1907, due to the departure of Tsontos and a number of chieftains towards Korestia, Christou, with his group, united with the group of G. Proimos, acting in all the areas of Prespa, Florina and southern Mariovo and Pelister. Then he moved south to Verno, where he cooperated with the chieftains I. Karavitis, Pavlos Rakovitis, S. Kleidis and P. Gerogiannis. In April 1907, along with the groups of chieftains Pavlos Nikolaidis, G. Tsontos and I. Karavitis, attacked komitadjis in Florina. Many young local people rushed then to be ranked among the armed groups of those chieftains. At the end of 1907 he took over the defense in the area of the villages of Kabasnitsa (now Proti) and Kladorrachi of Florina. In May 1908, after a clash with an Ottoman army detachment, southwest of Monastir (now Bitola), he escaped to Bukovo, where he was finally arrested. He was hanged on June 21, 1908, in Monastir, as a retaliation for the assassination of Deputy Governor Zeinel Bey of Nymfaio. In 1960 a bust was erected on a central street in Florina to honor him.Ο εμφύλιος των προτομών, Εκεί που χάνονται τα αγάλματα, Προτομές με το κιλό, Ιός, Κυριακάτικη Ελευθεροτυπία, 26 November 2000 == References == Category:1887 births Category:1908 deaths Category:Greek people of the Macedonian Struggle Category:Greek Macedonians Category:People from Bitola Municipality Category:Macedonian revolutionaries (Greek) Category:Executed Greek people Category:People executed by the Ottoman Empire by hanging Category:20th-century executions by the Ottoman Empire ","title":"Petros Christou"},{"id":"61302913","text":"Pierre Thiriar was a Belgian gymnast.
