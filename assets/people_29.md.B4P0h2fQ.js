The room's video recording system was running and recorded the event. He was 47 years old. ==Background== Cerna was stopped by Sheriff's Deputy Michael Parham for a traffic violation on December 19, 2003. He attempted to escape in his car and then later on foot. During the pursuit, he shot Parham twice in the abdomen, but the wound was not fatal. Cerna was arrested shortly afterward. The San Bernardino Police, the County Sheriff's Department, and the California Highway Patrol were all involved in the chase, but during his apprehension, no one ensured he was properly searched. Video surveillance footage showed that Cerna entered the interrogation room and asked head of homicide investigation Officer Bobby Dean for a bottle of water. When Cerna received the water, Dean walked out of the room. Now alone, Cerna reached under his pants and retrieved a .45-caliber handgun that he had concealed. He then put the gun up to his head and shot himself in the left temple. Cerna died on the scene. The County Sheriff's Department showed the security camera footage to the media the next day. To avoid sensationalism, only a limited number of selected reporters were permitted for viewing. Although the police tried to control access, the footage was leaked. ==Possible motive== Cerna, who had previously been convicted of other serious crimes, may have understood that he was about to catch a third strike case for wounding Deputy Parham and possibly preferred to end his own life rather than face a possible life sentence. ==ReferencesExternal links== *snopes.com: The Last Interrogation Category:1956 births Category:2003 deaths Category:Criminals who committed suicide Category:Filmed suicides Category:Male suicides Category:Guatemalan emigrants to the United States Category:Deaths in police custody in the United States Category:People from Guatemala City Category:People who committed suicide in prison custody Category:Suicides by firearm in California ","title":"Ricardo Cerna"},{"id":"46847459","text":"Alexander Brunton (Painting by John Watson Gordon) 35 Albany St, Edinburgh The grave of Rev Alexander Brunton and his wife Mary Balfour, Canongate Kirkyard Prof Very Rev Alexander Brunton DD FRSE FSA (2 October 1772 - 9 February 1854) was a Scottish minister in the Church of Scotland who rose to its highest rank, Moderator of the General Assembly in 1823.

His contributions to this new field of condensed matter physics have been comprehensive, ranging from the growth of the world's highest purity crystals of the materials of interest to the development of techniques for performing extremely high resolution transport and thermodynamic measurements at ultra-low temperatures. His work has led to the discovery of several new quantum many-body states. These include a superconducting analogue of the superfluid He3, a new class of quantum critical states and the first example of a liquid crystal state formed by strongly correlated electrons.

However, her stutter prevents her from receiving any marriage proposals including that of Diwakar Mishra, a short unattractive and superficial man who rejects her. She always speak with a pat so people named her - Thapki. Thapki finds employment at a television channel called News365 which is owned by Dhruv Pandey. Dhruv is a well educated and gentle man. Dhruv gets impressed by Thapki's work and soon they fall in love. Dhruv's mother, Vasundhara \\"Vasu\\" Pandey, disapproves of Thapki as a suitable match for her golden boy because of her stutter. On the wedding day, Vasu asks her adopted son, Bihaan, to poison Dhruv's food making him unconscious and then gets Bihaan married to Thapki. Vasu wants Dhruv to marry Shraddha. Thapki takes her place in the Pandey House as a daughter-in-law and one day, saves Vasu from a falling deity. Vasu regrets her attitude to Thapki. Bihaan starts falling in love with Thapki. Dhruv becomes jealous of Thapki and Bihaan and tries to break up their marriage before realising the error of his ways. Bihaan's biological family consisting of his mother Kosi Jaiswal and stepfather Naman arrive. They want a kidney from Bihaan for their son, Janardhan \\"John\\" Jaiswal. They discover that Bihaan was born with one kidney. Thapki tells Bihaan that his family want the kidney anyway but Bihaan does not believe her. Thapki is pregnant and writes to tell Bihaan but the letter is intercepted by Bihaan's family. Thapki has an accident and loses the baby. ===2 years later=== Thapki returns as a business tycoon called Vaani Oberoi. With the help of Dhruv, she exposes Kosi Devi who is thrown out of the house. Kabir takes revenge on Bihaan for setting alight the house of his sister, Neha. Thapki believes that Bihaan is innocent and soon Kabir does too. Thapki, Vasu and Neha expose Sankar as the true arsonist. Sankar escapes the police and Dhruv divorces Shraddha and marries Aditi, Thapki's sister. In a drunken state, he impregnates Aditi as well as Shraddha. Thapki becomes pregnant. Sankar fakes her death and Bihaan is arrested for her murder. Sankar blackmails Thapki saying he will save Bihaan if Thapki leaves him. Thapki leaves and later gives birth to twin daughters who are named Tina and Bani. Sankar tries to kill one of the daughters but she is saved by Bihaan who adopts her (not knowing she is his own daughter). Everyone thinks that one of the twin daughters is dead. Thapki leaves with Kabir. Bihaan tries to stop her. Shraddha tells Sankar that she knows that she had blackmailed Thapki and they form an alliance. Aditi overhears them and tells Bihaan. They go to Thapki but on the way are injured when Sharddha runs them over. ===7 years later=== Aditi is found dead. Dhruv blames Thapki. Aditi and Dhruv's daughter Ananya, and Shraddha and Dhruv's son veer, grow up together. Bihaan has lost his memory. Shraddha and Sankar mistreat Tina. Thapki is living with Bani. Thapki and Bihaan meet at their daughters' school. Thapki returns in order to help Bihaan's amnesia. Shraddha blackmails Tina into pressuring Bihaan and Sankar to marry. Bihaan's memory returns when Thapki reminds him of Sankar's behaviour. Sankar implicates Shraddha. When Vasu takes Bihaan and his family to a famous temple, a gangster called Amma Mai kidnaps Bani. Amma Mai wants Bani to marry her son Prince. Shraddha tries to make an alliance with Amma Mai. Shraddha's plan is revealed by Thapki. When Bihaan tries to save Bani, Bihaan is shot by Amma Mai and dies. Amma Mai and Monty are arrested. Bani blames her mother Thapki for Bihaan's death and leaves home. Kosi takes Bani in. Thapki is then kidnapped by Shraddha. Vasu rescues Thapki and defeats Shraddha. ===15 years later=== Tina is to marry Samar. Bani and Kosi arrive to take revenge on Thapki. Thapki asks Aryan, who looks like Bihaan, to impersonate Bihaan. Aryan is the older brother of Bani's fianc√©, Manav. On the day of marriage, Kosi creates mayhem in which Tina marries Manav and Bani marries Samar. Bani apologises to Thapki and Kosi is arrested. Aryan is told that Bani has died in an accident and Thapki's face has been completely changed by surgery after the accident. In fact, Thapki and Bani have been kidnapped by \\"Lovely\\", a bar dancer, who is impersonating Thapki. Thapki escapes but is blackmailed into silence by Lovely, who threatens to kill Bani. Lovely is Thapki's long lost twin sister who was separated from her family when Thapki pushed her. Lovely disguises Thapki with a veil and introduces her as Rajjo. However, the family are not fooled. Samar rescues Bani. Lovely apologises for her actions. Tina and Vasu have not yet forgiven Thapki for messing up her daughter's life. Vasu learns of Aryan and her husband Balvinder tries to kill him. Before he does, Bani explains all. Thapki is forgiven. Aryan is invited to stay with the family to take Bihaan's place.

His first formal lessons were with Theodor Aman and George Demetrescu Mirea at the \\"National School of Fine Arts\\" (now known as the Bucharest National University of Arts).Brief biography @ Muzeul Jude»õean de Art«é, Baia Mare. In 1891, Nicolae Grigorescu encouraged him to create some paintings for an exhibition at the Romanian Athenaeum and became his patron. Four years later, Str√¢mbu graduated from the Academy and became a freelance painter. His income was insufficient, so he entered a competition to become a Professor of drawing at the gymnasium in Craiova. He taught there briefly, then was awarded a scholarship to go to Munich, where he studied with Carl von Marr at the Academy of Fine Arts. In 1900, he went to Paris, where he participated in the Exposition Universelle. In 1901, he became a Professor at the National School. Later that year, together with »òtefan Luchian, Nicolae Vermont and several others, he helped establish \\"Tinerimea ArtisticƒÉ\\" (artistic youth) an organization that advocated realistic art, with ordinary people and peasant life as subjects. He continued to paint prolifically and exhibit widely throughout the 1910s and 20s; including displays at the Venice Biennale of 1924 and the International Exposition of Modern Industrial and Decorative Arts of 1925, in Paris. He also taught at the school in the artists' colony at Baia Mare, authored several textbooks and drawing manuals and was one the organizers of the \\"Muzeul Na»õional de ArtƒÉ PopularƒÉ\\" (folk art museum). Although his conservative style of painting had ceased to be popular by the time of his death, major retrospectives have been held twice; at the Craiova Art Museum in 1971 and the Art Museum of Drobeta-Turnu Severin in 1984. ==Selected paintings== File:Ipolit Strambu - Maternitate.jpgMaternity File:Ipolit Strambu - Pe ganduri.jpgSecond Thoughts File:Ipolit Strambu - Tarancuta.jpgCountry Girl File:Ipolit Strambu - Fata citind.jpgYoung Woman Reading File:Ipolit Strambu - Cochetarie.jpgCoquetry == References  External links == *Ipolit Str√¢mbu: Reminiscences and an appreciation of his art by V.

He is best known for his 2015 documentary Notfilm, his work with the Bruce Conner Family Trust and as Senior Film Restorationist at the UCLA Film & Television Archive, where he restored numerous independent and avant-garde works. Lipman was the 2008 recipient of Anthology Film Archives' Preservation Honors, and is a three-time winner of the National Society of Film Critics' Heritage Award. Lipman's essays on film history, technology, and aesthetics have been published in Artforum, Sight and Sound, and in numerous academic books and journals and his films have been screened internationally and have been collected by museums and archives. His 2015 feature-length documentary Notfilm about Samuel Beckett's Film was produced and distributed by Milestone Films and premiered at the BFI London Film Festival. The documentary was prompted by the discovery of long-missing footage from the original production of Film, which Lipman discovered amid reels of outtakes in the apartment of Grove Press publisher and Film producer, Barney Rosset. ==Publications== Known for his contributions to the theory of film restoration, particularly the ethics involved in restoring independent and experimental film, Ross Lipman has contributed numerous essays on the subject, beginning with ‚ÄúProblems of Independent Film Preservation‚Äù in 1996 and consolidated in ‚ÄúThe Gray Zone: A Restorationist‚Äôs Travel Guide‚Äù in 2009. Lipman's conceptualization of restoration theory has developed from years of practice within the field. His ideas have been controversial in acknowledging a subjectivity inherent in the process of restoration itself, a position once considered taboo from art conservation orthodoxy, but gaining increasing credence in recent years as museum conservators have been confronted with the transient nature of many post-war and contemporary artworks. Lipman is also the author of several historical analytical essays, including a definitive history of John Cassavetes and his collaboration with Charles Mingus on the score for Shadows, as well as an analysis of the ground-breaking production techniques used in Kent Mackenzie's The Exiles (1961). ==Filmmaking and Performance Essays== Ross Lipman's early works span across a multiplicity of forms. Of his films, Doug Cummings of LA Weekly wrote, \\"Lipman's repertoire often highlights unique social groups with whom he has lived\\", and his earlier films frequently explore themes of cultural decay and renewal. With the completed prologue for the in-progress documentary feature Keep Warm, Burn Britain!, Lipman uses still images to remember squatters he encountered in Thatcherite mid-1980s London. His more recent films continue in this essayistic vein, integrating visual artwork and scholarship. Ross Lipman's performance essays are often concerned with the intersection of cinema history and lived experience. His best known performance is The Book of Paradise Has No Author, which premiered Aug. 2011 at the Inquiry Towards the Practice of Secular Magic, a cross- disciplinary event at piXel (+) freQuency, hosted by Los Angeles Filmforum and presented by the Disembodied Theater Corporation. The piece explores notions of \\"first encounters\\" with lost cultures, viewed through the prism of the Tasaday tribe, who were, according to a 1972 episode of 20/20, a primitive tribe that had only recently encountered contemporary civilization. The performance essay The Exploding Digital Inevitable premiered at International Film Festival Rotterdam in January 2017. The essay concerns the process of restoring Bruce Conner's classic avant-garde short Crossroads (1976 film), for which several versions existed. ==Restoration== Ross Lipman was mentored by and worked under Robert Gitt, well-known UCLA Film & Television Archive restorationist who restored or supervised the restoration of over 360 films. Lipman adapted and developed methods of applying these principles to the restoration of independent and experimental film, where the primary concept is that moving image restoration is a form of interdisciplinary art practice that differs from other visual art forms in its production for mass duplication. Lipman has theorized and elaborated on this concept in numerous publications. ===Restored Narrative Films=== * Spring Night, Summer Night (1967) - J.L.

Upon returning to Laos after completing their training, they went to provide the core of a new Para-Commando battalion which was assigned to Military Region 5, hence became known as \\"Military Region 5 Commandos\\". ==Structure and organization== By January 1970, MR 5 Cdos strength peaked at 340 officers and enlisted men, all airborne-qualified volunteers, organized into a battalion comprising one headquarters (HQ), three company HQ sections, and three Commando companies.Conboy and McCouaig, South- East Asian Special Forces (1991), p. 18. The unit was based in Ban Y Lai, north of Vientiane, Laos capital city.Conboy and McCouaig, South-East Asian Special Forces (1991), p. 19. ==Operational history 1969-1975== The MR 5 Cdos were initially employed primarily on counter-insurgency sweeps targeting Pathet Lao guerrilla units around Vientiane, though in later years they were deployed in other military regions to demonstrate symbolic support from the Royal Lao Government. During September 1971 one company participated in Operation Golden Mountain, the successful capture of Phou Khout Mountain, overlooking Muang Soui in Military Region 2 (Long Tieng),Conboy and Morrison, Shadow War: The CIA's Secret War in Laos (1995), p. 302. and in 1972 two companies were sent to Military Region 4 (Pakse) to assist RLA units in the recapture of Khong Sedone. As late as May 1975, after the collapse of the FAR, a single remaining company from the MR 5 Cdos was fighting Pathet Lao forces north of the Laotian capital city.Conboy and McCouaig, South-East Asian Special Forces (1991), p. 19. ==Weapons and equipment== The MR 5 Cdos used the standard weaponry and equipment of US origin issued to FAR units, complemented by captured Soviet or Chinese small-arms such as AK-47 assault rifles that allowed its personnel to use ammunition retrieved from enemy caches while on operations. * Smith & Wesson Model 10 Revolver * Colt.45 M1911A1 Pistol * Smith & Wesson Model 39 Pistol * TT-33 Pistol * Type 56 assault rifle * Type 56-1 Assault rifle * AKM Assault rifle * M16A1 Assault rifle * CAR-15 Assault carbine * RPD Light machine gun * Type 56 Light machine gun * M72 LAW Anti- tank rocket launcher * M79 grenade launcher * M203 grenade launcher * M1918A2 BAR Light machine gun * Browning M1919A4 .30 Cal Medium machine gun * M19 Mortar 60 mm * M18 Claymore anti-personnel mines ==See also== * Air America (airline) * Commando Raider Teams * Directorate of National Coordination * Laotian Civil War * Lao People's Armed Forces * Pathet Lao * Royal Lao Armed Forces * Royal Lao Army Airborne * Special Guerrilla Units (SGU) * SPECOM * Vietnam War * Weapons of the Laotian Civil War ==EndnotesReferences== *Kenneth Conboy and Simon McCouaig, South-East Asian Special Forces, Elite series 33, Osprey Publishing Ltd, London 1991. *Kenneth Conboy with James Morrison, Shadow War: The CIA's Secret War in Laos, Boulder CO: Paladin Press, 1995. , 1581605358 ===Further reading=== *Kenneth Conboy and Don Greer, War in Laos 1954-1975, Carrollton, TX: Squadron/Signal Publications, 1994. *Kenneth Conboy and Simon McCouaig, The War in Laos 1960-75, Men-at-arms series 217, Osprey Publishing Ltd, London 1989. *Khambang Sibounheuang (edited by Edward Y.

It was built in 1658 as the sixth of the De Redin towers. An artillery battery was built around it in 1715. Today, the tower and battery are intact but in a dilapidated condition. Aƒßrax Tower is the northernmost fortification on the main island of Malta. ==History== Aƒßrax Tower was built by November 1658 in the area known as \\"l-Aƒßrax tal-Mellieƒßa\\". Construction had cost 589 scudi, 5 tari and 15 grammi. Its structure is similar to the other De Redin towers, having a square base and two floors. However, the base of Aƒßrax Tower is slightly larger than some of the other towers. An escutcheon once stood over the main doorway with De Redin's coat of arms, although this is no longer in place. Just as was the case with Gƒßajn ƒ¶adid Tower, a well was located close to the tower to supply water to the militia stationed in the tower. Commemorative plaque and missing escutcheon In 1715, an artillery battery was built around the tower, and it was called Batteria della Harach. The battery consisted of a semicircular gun platform with an en barbette parapet, a blockhouse that was built on the western wall of the tower, and two walls linking the tower to the gun platform. It was surrounded by a rock hewn ditch. In the 1743 inspection, Aƒßrax Tower was armed with two bronze cannons, gun wheels and stocks, sixteen cannonballs, four muskets, one rotolo of musket balls and ten rotolos of gunpowder. Thirty years later, in 1770, the battery was armed with ten iron cannons with 700 iron balls and 150 grapeshot rounds. The gunpowder was stored in Saint Agatha's Tower. In the 19th century, the British used the tower as a naval station and they added several rooms to the tower's structure. At a point it served as the Governor's summer residence and a British coat of arms replaced De Redin's personal arms. After World War II the tower was privately owned but it was eventually abandoned. ==Present day== The tower's interior The area around the tower is now covered with concrete and the foundations of some walls of the battery have never been excavated. Over the years Aƒßrax Tower was heavily modified so it is now difficult to see which parts are original and which were added later. The battery remains largely intact, with the exception of one of the linking walls. In 2009, the tower was passed to the Mellieƒßa Local Council. It is in need of restoration. ==ReferencesExternal links== *National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands *YouTube video showing a 3D model of Aƒßrax Tower and Battery Category:De Redin towers Category:Batteries in Malta Category:Towers completed in 1658 Category:Official residences in Malta Category:Mellieƒßa Category:National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands Category:1658 establishments in Malta ","title":"Aƒßrax Tower"},{"id":"46847702","text":"Aileen Donnelly is an Irish judge who has served as a Judge of the Court of the Appeal since June 2019.

It is a type of tattoo which appears on the areola and is semi- permanent. Nipple tattooing has its origins as a medical procedure (medical tattoo) for breast reconstruction after a mastectomy. It is increasingly commonly used as a cosmetic procedure, which began being reported on in early 2013, used to enlarge, darken and define the nipples and areola, with the intent to improve the 'sexiness' of the nipple. This practice began in the United States but slowly trickled through to the United Kingdom, with many Britons opting to travel to the US to have the procedure done. The procedure involves having the participant picking the colour of the nipple tattoo (usually involving a mixture of pigments), and then having a local anesthetic applied. The tattoo device is dipped into the pigment and then applied to the nipple until uniform. The procedure usually takes about 30 to 40 minutes. Breasts can be tattooed so that the colour and shape of the nipples and the areola appear bigger, more deeply coloured, more shapely or with better definition. However, the cosmetic procedure has been criticized, with one blogger on The Guardian complaining that the whole idea of the nipple tattoo \\"smacks of media confection\\". Since September 2011, the Royal Derby Hospital offers free nipple tattoos for breast surgery patients in order to mask the scars of surgery. The purchase of the tattoo device was funded by the Ashbourne Breast Cancer Walk. Vinnie Myers of Little Vinnie's Tattoos in Finksburg, Maryland, has performed nipple tattoos on over 5,000 women who have undergone surgery for breast cancer, including those of Caitlin Kiernan, who wrote a story about Mr. Myers in The New York Times. A similar service offered without charge in 2017 by a cosmetic tattooist in the UK was booked up six months ahead. ==References== Category:Tattooing by body part Category:Tattooing and medicine Tattoo ","title":"Nipple tattoo"},{"id":"46847791","text":"Romulus is a hamlet (and census-designated place) located in the Town of Romulus, Seneca County, New York, United States on the border with the Town of Varick.

He showed considerable talent as a juvenile, winning the Prix Yacowlef, Prix Morny and Prix de Seine-et-Oise. In the following year, he recovered from two defeats by La Farina to establish himself as the best racehorse in Europe with a string of victories which included the Prix Hocquart, Prix d'H√©douville, Prix du Jockey Club, Grand Prix de Paris, Prix de President de la Republique and Prix Eug√®ne Adam before his racing career was ended by the outbreak of the First World War. He has been rated one of the best horses ever to be trained in France. ==Background== Sardanapale was a bay horse with a white blaze bred at the Haras de Champagne de Saint-Hilaire in France by his owner Maurice de Rothschild. He was probably the best horse sired by Prestige, who was undefeated in sixteen races including the Prix de la For√™t, Grand Crit√©rium and Prix Jean Prat. His dam Gemma, was a British-bred daughter of Florizel, a top-class racehorse who was a full-brother to Persimmon and Diamond Jubilee. Gemma was a full-sister to the 2000 Guineas winner Vedas and a granddaughter of the influential broodmare Bonnie Agnes whose other descendants have included Zabeel, Detroit, Carnegie and Herbager. As a yearling, Sardanapale was offered for sale with a reserve price of ¬£1000, but was bought back by his owner when the bidding reached ¬£1,200. Rothschild sent the colt into training with James d'Okhuysen. ==Racing career1913: two-year-old season=== Sardanapale was one of the leading French two-year-olds of 1913. He began his racing career with a win in the Prix Yacowlef, for previously unraced horses over 1000 metres at Deauville Racecourse in August. Later that month at the same track, he won the more prestigious Prix Morny over 1200 metres, with the beaten horses including La Farina, owned by Maurice de Rothschild's cousin Edouard Alphonse de Rothschild. In September he was tried against older horses and won the Prix de Seine-et-Oise over 1400 metres at Maisons-Laffitte Racecourse.http://www.galopp- sieger.de/galoppsieger/sieger?rennkz=FMaSeiOi&backlink;=1 In the late autumn of 1913 he finished third to Le Grand Presigny in the Grand Crit√©rium and second behind the same colt in the Prix de la For√™t.http://www.galopp- sieger.de/galoppsieger/sieger?rennkz=FR-011&backlink;=1 ===1914: three-year- old season=== In the spring of 1914, Sardanapale won the Prix Lagrange from Le Grand Pressigny and Durbar and then finished fourth to the four-year-old Nimbus (FR) in the Prix Boiard. He then won the Prix Hocquart and the Prix Miss Gladiator but was beaten by La Farina in both the Prix Daru and the Prix Lupin. He returned to winning form to take the Prix d'H√©douville at Chantilly Racecourse. At the same course in June, Sardanapale started the 1.85/1 favourite for the Prix du Jockey Club over 2400 metres. He was opposed by eleven opponents including Durbar, who had beaten Le Grand Pressigny in the Prix Noailles before winning the 1914 Epsom Derby for France. Ridden by George Stern, he won by two lengths from Diderot, with Le Corsaire third and Durbar fourth. On 28 June, Sardanapale faced a rematch with La Farina in the Grand Prix de Paris over 3000 metres at Longchamp Racecourse and started the 1.95/1 favourite in a twelve-runner field. La Farina led from the start and when George Stern moved Sardanapale up to challenge 800 metres out, the two colts drew away from the rest of the field. After a prolonged struggle, Sardanapale got the better of his rival 100 metres from the finish and won by a neck, with a gap of four lengths back to Durbar in third place. Among the spectators was the Austrian ambassador who left the course on hearing the news of the assassination Franz Ferdinand. In July, Sardanapale contested the Prix du Pr√©sident de la R√©publique over 2500 metres at Maisons-Laffitte Racecourse. La Farina was again in opposition along with the British colt Florist and the four-year-old Nimbus. Sardanapale won again, beating the Prix Berteux winner Djamy into second by three lengths with Fauche le Vent in third place. After the race he was described in the press as \\"possibly the best three-year-old in the world\\". In August, Sardanapale won the Prix Eug√®ne Adam at Maisons- Laffitte by five lengths from Oreste and Djamy but it proved to be his final appearance, as racing in France was shut down by the outbreak of the War. Whilst many horses were requisitioned by the military, Sardanapale was \\"reserved for stud purposes\\". ==Stud record== After his retirement from racing Sardanapale became a breeding stallion in France, standing at Rothschild's stud at Chaumont en Vexin before moving to the Haras de la Fontaine in 1926. The best of his offspring included Fiterari, a colt who won the Poule d'Essai des Poulains, Grand Prix de Paris and Prix Royal Oak in 1927, a year in which Sardanapale was Leading sire in France. He also sired the Italian champion Apelle, whose wins included the Derby Italiano, Gran Premio di Milano and Coronation Cup. Another of his sons was Dis Donc the sire of the American champion filly Top Flight. He also had success as a sire of broodmares and was the damsire of Black Maria and Brokers Tip. Sardanapale died in December 1934 at the age of 23. ==Assessment== In their book A Century of Champions, based on a modified version of the Timeform system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Sardanapale the forty-first best racehorse of twentieth century, the ninth-best of the century to have been trained in France, and the best horse in the world in 1914. ==PedigreeReferences== Category:1911 racehorse births Category:1934 racehorse deaths Category:Racehorses bred in France Category:Racehorses trained in France Category:Thoroughbred family 16-c ","title":"Sardanapale (horse)"},{"id":"46847815","text":"Mar√≠a Enriqueta Camarillo (also known as Mar√≠a Enriqueta Camarillo y Roa de Pereyra) (1872‚Äì1968) was a Mexican poet-novelist, short story writer and translator. She was highly decorated for her works having schools and libraries named after her, as well as a bust by Spanish sculptor Mariano Benlliure erected in Hidalgo Park in Mexico City in her honor. She received the 1923 literary prize from Acad√©mie fran√ßaise for her novel El Secreto. She was awarded a collaborative partnership in 1927 with the Real Academia Hispano-Americana de Ciencias y Artes of C√°diz for her textbook Rosas de la Infancia and for the same work a prize as best children's literature at the Literary Salon of the Universal Exposition in Seville, Spain. Camarillo was granted the Order of Isabella the Catholic in 1947 and in 1948 received the Civil Order of Alfonso X, the Wise. ==Biography== Mar√≠a Enriqueta Camarillo y Roa was born 19 January 1872 in Coatepec, Veracruz, Mexico to Alejo Camarillo and Dolores Roa B√°rcena who, turn was niece of the writer Jos√© Mar√≠a Roa B√°rcena. There is a plaque affixed to the house she was born in located on Jim√©nez del Campillo Street in Coatepec. In 1879, her father was elected to the Chamber of Deputies and moved the family from Coatepec to Mexico City. In 1887, she entered the National Conservatory of Music and earned her diploma as a piano teacher in 1895. Without giving up her music, Camarillo then takes up painting and writing verse. In 1897, her father was posted to an administrative position in Nuevo Laredo and the family left the capital. In 1894 she published her first poem, ‚ÄúHast√≠o‚Äù in the literary supplement of the newspaper El Universal, using the pseudonym Ivan Moszkowski. She kept sending poems to El Universal and the Revista Azul even after the family moved to Nueva Larado. In 1897, she began sending work to Mundo Ilustrado, El Expectador in Monterrey, Cr√≥nica in Guadalajara and the El Diario in Mexico City, as well. In 1898, Camarillo married and returned to Mexico City. Her first book, one of a single long poem was published in 1902. The following year, her father died and Manuel Guti√©rrez N√°jera offered her the opportunity to tell his story in Revista Azul. \\"El maestro Floriani\\" was her first published prose piece and was dedicated to her father's memory. The first book of a poetry collection Rumores de mi huerto (Rumors of my garden) appeared in 1908 and would be republished in 1922. She worked at a feminist magazine, called La Mujer Mexicana (The Mexican Woman) from 1904 to 1906. The ideology was directed to the nineteenth century culture of domesticity, but it was one of the first Mexican magazines written by women for women. The women who wrote for La Mujer Mexicana were poets, writers, teachers, lawyers, and doctors, including besides Camarillo, attorney Mar√≠a Sandoval de Zarco; writers Dolores Roa B√°rcena de Camarillo (her mother), Laura M√©ndez de Cuenca, Dolores Jim√©nez y Muro and Dolores Correa Zapata, who was also a teacher; the medical doctors Columba Rivera, Guadalupe S√°nchez and Antonia Urs√∫a; and the teachers Luz Fern√°ndez Vda. de Herrera and Mateana Murgu√≠a de Aveleyra. In 1912, she was commissioned by the publisher Viuda de Charles Bouret of Paris to write a series of children's books for grammar schools‚Äîone book for each grade. Rosas de la Infancia was written in 6 volumes, but only 5 were published. The work was to be used as textbooks, and after its 1914 printing, became mandatory under the educational reforms initiated by Jos√© Vasconcelos, Secretariat of Education. They remained a mainstay in Mexican education until L√°zaro C√°rdenas changed school curricula to a Socialist ideology. The book won several awards from Spain as well, but they were much later, after Mexico was no longer using it as a textbook. In 1927, she was awarded a collaborative partnership with the Real Academia Hispano-Americana de Ciencias y Artes of C√°diz and in 1930, she won best children's literature for Rosas de la Infancia at the Literary Salon of the Universal Exposition in Seville, Spain. Her first novel, Mirliton was published in Madrid in 1918 and well-received, being then translated into French. That same year, she published Jir√≥n de Mundo (Strip of the World) and followed that with Sorpresas de la vida (Surprises of Life) in 1921. El Secreto (1922) was one of her most praised works. It was translated into Italian and Portuguese and, in Mexico, schools and libraries were renamed in her honor. A monument was erected in Hidalgo Park in Mexico City, which featured a bronze bust of Camarillo, created by the Spanish sculptor Mariano Benlliure. The novel was selected in 1923, by the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise of France, as the best Hispanic female novel and was translated into French. She received a prize from the Acad√©mie, as well as receiving praise from Paul Val√©ry. Entre el polvo de un castillo (Between the dust of the castle) (1924) was a children's book. El misterio de su muerte and Enigma y S√≠mbolo were both published in 1926, after which she returned to poetry with Album sentimental (1926). Cuentecillos de cristal (1928) was another collection of children's stories translated into Portuguese and was followed by El arca de colores in 1929. Her next book Brujas, Lisboa, Madrid is unlike anything she had written before. It was a travelogue of a sort, looking at the spirits of the cities of Bruges, Lisbon, and Madrid and how the essence of each city had affected her. Del tapiz de mi vida (Tapestry of my life) is a collection of autobiographical reflections on children, he mother's death, and travels through Belgium, Switzerland, and Spain. Camarillo's husband was a diplomat in the service of President Porfirio D√≠az. When D√≠az was ousted from power, the couple went into exile in Spain. She lived in Spain for 32 years. After the death of her husband in 1942, Camarillo decided to return to Mexico and permanently returned in 1948. In addition to her own writing, Camarillo translated the works from classical French theater and literature of the seventeenth century; witnesses of the French Revolution; and philosophers like Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve, Henri-Fr√©d√©ric Amiel, and Rodolphe T√∂pffer. Camarillo died on 13 February 1968 in Mexico City, Mexico and was buried in the City Cemetery of Coatepec, Veracruz. ==Personal details== In 1898, she married the historian and diplomat Carlos Pereyra. They had no children. Her house was converted into a museum. Now it called the \\"House Museum Maria Enriqueta Camarillo\\" and is located in her hometown of Coatepec, Veracruz, Mexico, at the following address: Ignacio Zaragoza 3 Centro, 91500 Coatepec, Veracruz-Llave, Mexico. Phone: +52 228 816 0499. This home was not where she was born, but she received it as a gift when she returned to Mexico after living abroad for many years. website: Casa Museo de Mar√≠a Enriqueta ==Awards== *1923 literary prize from Acad√©mie fran√ßaise for El Secreto, Best Hispanic female novel *1927 for Rosas de la Infancia was awarded a collaborative partnership with the Real Academia Hispano-Americana de Ciencias y Artes of C√°diz *1930 she won best children's literature for Rosas de la Infancia at the Literary Salon of the Universal Exposition in Seville, Spain *1947 she was granted the Order of Isabella the Catholic *1948 received the Civil Order of Alfonso X, the Wise ==Selected worksPoems=== *\\"Hast√≠o\\" El Universal, Mexico City, Mexico (1894) *\\"Ruinas\\" El Universal, Mexico City, Mexico (1894) *\\"Mis dos amores\\" El Universal, Mexico City, Mexico (1894) *\\"Las consecuencias de un sue√±o\\" La Carpeta: Mexico City (1902) (in Spanish) *\\"Rumores de mi huerto\\" Mexico (1908) (in Spanish) and reprinted by Juan Pueyo: Madrid (1922) (In Spanish) *\\"Parnaso de Mexico: antolog√≠a general\\" Porrua, Mexico City (1920) (in Spanish) *\\"Rincones rom√°nticos\\" Juan Pueyo: Madrid (1922) (In Spanish) *\\"Album sentimental\\" Espasa-Calpe: Madrid (1926) (In Spanish) *\\"Poes√≠as del Campo\\" Espasa-Calpe: Madrid (1935) (In Spanish) *\\"Recordando dulcemente\\" Imprenta Sap.: Madrid (1946) (In Spanish) *\\"Hojas Dispersas\\" Patria: Mexico (1950) (In Spanish) ===Narratives=== *\\"La puerta verde\\" *\\"La mano de mi padre\\" *\\"Una culebra\\" *\\"Esquilo y B√©quer\\" *\\"Urgente\\" ===Books=== *Rosas de la infancia: lectura para los ni√±os Viuda de Charles Bouret: Paris (1914) (In Spanish) *Mirliton, le compagnon de Jean Gedalge: Paris (1917) (in French) *Mirlit√≥n J.

Steele with Lhamo Dhondup in Amdo before being invested with the title of Dalai Lama in 1939. Archibald Trojan Steele (25 June 1903 Toronto, Ontario - 26 February 1992 Sedona, Arizona) was an American foreign or war correspondent for United Press, The New York Times, the Chicago Daily News and the New York Herald Tribune.\\"Archibald T. Steele; Journalist Reported From China in the '30s,\\" Los Angeles Times (March 13, 1992) He covered China, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Africa from the early 1930s until his retirement in 1960. He then published several books, and is known for filing reports of the Nanjing Massacre in 1937 that first informed the world of the activities of the Japanese Army. In 1950 Steele was co-winner of a George Polk award, given by Long Island University, for reporting on China for The New York Herald Tribune. In 1955 he won a Maria Moors Cabot medal, given by Columbia University, for articles in The Herald Tribune about a journey with his wife from Alaska to Chile. In 1966, he was named by Secretary of State Dean Rusk to a panel of nineteen experts to advise on US policy on China Steele recalled that \\"When I returned from the Orient I would usually take refuge in Boise, Idaho, capital of the potato state. Usually the State Department didn't even know that I was in the country. I was never sought out when I returned from China.\\" Steven W. Mosher's book, China Misperceived included Steele in his criticisms of the China Hands, the diplomats and journalists who were held responsible for the loss of China. In response to these and other comments, the journalist Harrison Salisbury wrote in 1991 that Steele deserved \\"a special place in the journalist's Hall of Fame.\\" ==Family and education== Steele was born to James Arthur and Clara (Trojan) Steele in Toronto, Ontario, Canada on June 25, 1903. He had six brothers and sisters. In 1915 the family moved to Salt Lake City, Utah, then Twin Falls, Idaho, before Boise, Idaho, where they stayed. Steele graduated from Stanford University in 1924, and then became a cub reporter for the Capital News in Boise. He moved to Downey, California, where he wrote for the Willows Journal.Biographical Note A. T. Steele Papers 1931-1982, 1995-1999 Arizona State University Library In the early years of the Depression, Steele owned The Downey Champion, a small weekly newspaper in California, when the Japanese invaded Manchuria beginning September 18, 1931. He recalled later that \\"Up to that moment I had had no interest whatever in China. My sole interest was in the orange crop around Downey, California, where I was working, and in trying to keep my head above water.\\" Rather than remain and go slowly bankrupt, Steele turned the newspaper over to his business manager, gathered a small amount of cash and took a ship named Taiyo Maru for Shanghai. Steele knew little about China and had no prospects for a job, but arrived just before the Japanese attack on Shanghai in 1931, and soon was hired to cover the war. Steele later explained that \\"one could get a very quick education\\" in those days because \\"Shanghai was an international city with its International Settlement and French Concession and a very large and lively Chinese population.\\" He added that \\"it might not all be accurate, but it would certainly teach you in a very short time to take a strong position on China.\\" He found himself disagreeing with resident foreigners who asked \\"What's wrong with China?\\" When the Battle of Shanghai began in 1937, he could go back and forth across the battle lines and observe the Japanese in action and then talk to the commander of the Chinese forces, who put up a \\"brilliant defense at a time when the Chinese were being generally maligned as very poor fighters.\\" ==Covering the Nanjing Massacre and the Sino-Japanese War== In the fall of 1937, Steele was one of five American journalists who remained in Nanjing after it fell to the Japanese. Steele broke the news about the events that became known as the \\"Rape of Nanking\\" (The New York Times correspondent F. Tillman Durdin is sometimes mistakenly credited as being the first.) Steele and Durdin left for Shanghai on the Oahu, an American naval vessel, and Steele bribed an American sailor to allow him to radio his dispatches. The Chicago Daily News ran Steele's article on December 15, 1937, while The New York Times story appeared three days later. A recent historian, Masahiro Yamamoto, wrote that although scholars have come to rely on the reports of these journalists less and less, \\"judging from the records and documents available from other sources, one may conclude that despite some erroneous assumptions and sensationalism typical in media war coverage these two American journalists basically told almost every essential detail of the atrocities in Nanking.\\" Steele saw panic and confusion among the Chinese defenders, who had been abandoned by their commanders, and reported that between 5,000 and 20,000 Chinese soldiers had been killed. Neither he nor Durdin mentioned the number of civilian victims, but Steele wrote that \\"streets throughout the city were littered with bodies of civilians...\\" (The worst of the civilian casualties happened after Steele and Durdin left on December 15). When the national government led by Chiang Kai-shek retreated to the wartime capital, Chongqing, Steele accompanied it. There he came to know Zhou Enlai, who was stationed in the city during the war as representative of the Chinese Communist Party. Steele was impressed with Zhou's power to manipulate correspondents' views and opinions. \\"As a male,\\" he told a conference of journalists and scholars in 1984, \\"I would find it difficult to say that I was captivated by Chou, although I was certainly captivated by Kung P'eng (Gong Peng). But in discussing Chou I think we haven't really touched on the basic question of the extent to which people like Chou, and particularly Chou, manipulated the views of the correspondents in China and their coverage of Chinese events.\\" He explained: :Remember Chungking in those days and how difficult it was to get the truth about anything, how futile it was to go to the Chinese Ministry of Information to get their superficial communiqu√©s, which could easily be disproved and were usually just nonsense. Then you would go to a little cubbyhole on the side street in Chungking that was occupied by the liaison officer of the Chinese Communists, who were then our allies, and hear from a charming person like Chou En-lai an explanation of, say, the latest conflict between the Kuomintang forces and the People's Liberation Army in some remote area of the interior, giving in great detail the facts, as he reported them, of what was going on out there. It was very tempting indeed to give considerable prominence to the detailed version and very persuasive words that we got from Chou and to more or less ignore‚Äîand quite rightly, I think, in most cases‚Äîthe Nationalists' communiqu√©s. His other travels during the war included a 1938 visit to Yan'an, the Chinese Communist wartime headquarters, and a 1944 trip to Tibet for the Chicago Daily News, where he met the Dalai Lama, who was then a young boy. Of all his travels and assignments, he late wrote, the trip to Tibet and meeting the Dalai Lama were the most exciting. ==Post-war career== After 1945, Steele was posted to Japan, where he reported on the Tokyo War Crimes Trials. He traveled widely in East and Southeast Asia, then covered Central and South America from August 1953 to May 1954. and undertook a jeep trip from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego with his wife from August 1954 to August 1955. He retired in 1960 to Sedona, Arizona. In 1966, he was named by Secretary of State Dean Rusk to a panel of nineteen experts to advise on US policy on China In that year he published The American People and China, a survey of US public opinion, and in 1977 Shanghai and Manchuria, 1932: Recollections of a War Correspondent (Center for Asian Studies, Arizona State University). Steele died of cancer at his home on February 26, 1992. At his death Steele was editing the Chicago Daily News articles from his 1944 trip to Tibet. The book was privately published in 1993 as In the Kingdom of the Dalai Lama, with a foreword by the Dalai Lama. ==Family life== He and Esther Frances Johnston (1910-1980) were married January 16, 1933 in Tokyo, Japan. They had courted when they were in California. ==Published works== * * * == NotesReferences== * Biographical Note A. T.

The founder of the Beginnings Academy, Sklar has lectured throughout North America on child development, education, and the arts. == Early life and education== Sklar was born on April 3, 1949 in New York City. His father, Harold, was a public elementary school principal and his mother, Sybil, taught special needs students at New York‚Äôs Bellevue Hospital. Sklar began to study piano at 6, and at 12, he was awarded a scholarship to the Juilliard School of Music, where he studied classical piano and music theory. In 1965, while trying to interview Martin Luther King Jr. for the New Rochelle, New York chapter of the Congress of Racial Equality, 16-year-old Sklar was arrested at King's hotel in Philadelphia. In 1970, while a student at the University of Hartford, he was part of a group called Concerned Connecticut Citizens for Sincere Dialogue and participated in a demonstration against a visit by Spiro Agnew. Also while a student, he wrote several articles published in the university newspaper UH News addressing racism, the environment, and other controversial issues of the time. He studied education, psychology, and theater arts at the University of Hartford and University of Massachusetts Boston and was admitted to the Harvard University Graduate School of Education based on a theater arts program for disadvantaged children and teens he developed at a youth center in Boston. He earned a Master's degree in Education (Ed.M.) in 1978. Sklar's contributions to the youth center in Boston were chronicled by the center's founder, Fred Rosene, in his book, Making a Difference. ==Career== After he graduated from Harvard, Sklar moved back to the New York area. In 1981 he founded and directed a vocal showcase in New York \\"Professional Children's Revue,\\" where he worked with young actors appearing in films, TV, commercials and voiceovers, including a teenage Sarah Jessica Parker, Justin Henry, and Lori Loughlin and most of the child actors appearing in the original casts of Broadway's Annie and Evita, and the revival of Peter Pan. In 1983, Sklar began to speak on the connection between child development and the arts. His talks evolved into a series of lectures, presented several months each year to high schools and performing arts venues throughout the United States and Canada. Topics include the role of self-esteem and health in achieving success in the professional performing arts field. His work with professional children evolved into a yearly resident performing arts workshop \\"Beginnings\\", which he founded in 1984. The program evolved into the Beginnings Academy which provides training in acting, voice, dance, and writing by working New York actors, directors, playwrights, casting directors, and choreographers, and culminates in an Off Broadway showcase at the Orpheum Theatre, Union Square Theater, and other New York City theater locations. Mischa Barton, Reese Witherspoon, Zachery Ty Bryan, Hunter Parrish, Kirsten Storms, and other actors have attended Beginnings. In 1995 Samuel French, Inc. published a collection of monologues containing dramatic and comedy pieces written by Sklar, entitled Winning Monologues from the Beginnings Workshop, with additional pieces written by actor and writer, Mark Weston, a former instructor at Beginnings. In 2004, the Academy began offering training with the Royal Shakespeare Company in Stratford-upon-Avon, as well as classes with industry professionals from British television, film, and theater, including performers and directors from London's West End and the Royal National Theater. In 2008, Sklar began a series of yearly workshops in Hollywood, California. Students currently work with on-set coaches including Marnie Cooper (students have included Miley Cyrus, Mila Kunis, Miranda Cosgrove, Olivia Holt, and others) as well as talent agents, directors, and film and television actors. http://www.centerstagemusicschool.com/Peter-Sklar.html In the late 1990s, Sklar began writing an original musical which he intended to produce on Broadway entitled The Kid Who Played the Palace. The project is still in development. == References  External links == * Personal website * Business website Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Harvard Graduate School of Education alumni Category:American educators Category:University of Hartford alumni Category:University of Massachusetts Boston alumni ","title":"Peter Sklar"},{"id":"46847943","text":"Shield fern is a common name for ferns in several genera and may refer to: *Dryopteris *Lastreopsis *Polystichum Category:Ferns ","title":"Shield fern"},{"id":"46847977","text":"The Allianz Stadion is a football stadium which is built on the site of the former Gerhard Hanappi Stadium as the new home of SK Rapid Wien.

Bees infected with CBPV begin to show symptoms after 5 days and die a few days after. Chronic bee paralysis virus infection is a factor that can contribute to or cause the sudden collapse of honeybee colonies. Since honeybees serve comprise a vital force in ecological resilience, it is important to understand factors and diseases that threaten them. Although CBPV infects mainly adult bees, the virus can also infect bees in earlier developmental stages, though developing bees typically have significantly lower viral loads compared to their adult counterparts. Death as a result of CBPV infection in developing bees or brood losses due to viral infection are low or nonexistent. Bees that have been infected with CBPV may harbor millions of viral particles, with half of them concentrated in the head region of the infected honey bee. As a result, the virus has neurotropic activity, allowing the virus to cause nervous system damage in infected honey bees. Specifically, research has identified that viral particles concentrate primarily in two centers of the brain to replicate after infecting the host. The first replication center is the mushroom bodies, which play a role in sensory processing, memory, learning, and motor control, and the second replication center the central body, the center of the insect brain that primarily control locomotion, behavior, bodily orientation, and arousal. == Virology == Chronic bee paralysis virus shares similarities to the virus families Nodaviridae and Tombusviridae, but CBPV is distinct enough from the two existing families and consequently is considered a new family of viruses. As a result, CBPV has yet to be fully classified.Aurore Chevin, Bruno Coutard, Philippe Blanchard, Anne- Sophie Dabert-Gay, Magali Ribi√®re-Chabert, Richard Thi√©ry: Characterisation of Structural Proteins from Chronic Bee Paralysis Virus (CBPV) Using Mass Spectrometry, in: Viruses. 2015 Jun; 7(6): 3329‚Äì3344. doi:10.3390/v7062774, , Chronic bee paralysis virus is a single-stranded positive-RNA virus with five fragments, two large fragments and three small fragments. The first large fragment is suspected to encode an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, as it possesses 8 conserved domains of an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The second large fragment is thought to encode for the virus capsid protein, which is reported to be a capsid protein of 23.5 kDa and four polypeptides of 75, 50, 30 and 20 kDa. The virus capsid is hypothesized to have icosahedral symmetry. Chronic bee paralysis virus is also found to facilitate the growth and reproduction of a satellite virus, called Chronic bee paralysis associate satellite virus (CBVA), which has three small (+) single-stranded RNA fragments. The three small (+) single-stranded RNA fragments appear inconsistently in the Chronic bee paralysis virus, which lends to the idea that the three RNAs are not components of CBPV but of a satellite virus that relies on CBPV activity in order to proliferate. Additionally, the three small RNA fragments each have molecular weights of 0.35 x 106 (1100 nucleotides), which exactly matches the molecular weights of the three (+) ssRNA fragments of CBVA. == Infection and transmission == Chronic bee paralysis virus is transmitted through two main mechanisms. The first mechanism is viral transmission through bee feces, which remains on the hive floor and can be picked up on the furry legs of other bees and ingested orally. The second mechanism is through close contact between bees in the hive. Worker bees are the most susceptible to infection, since they travel the hive most frequently. The infection may spread between hives as a result of indirect contact or direct contact between honey bees. Research shows that mainly adult honey bees can be infected with chronic bee paralysis virus by a topical contact with infected feces or by ingestion of virion-containing substances. === Viral replication cycle ===  Entry into cell  Chronic bee paralysis virus is transmitted to honey bees through a ubiquitous parasite common to honey bee hives, Varroa mites (Varroa jacobsoni). Varroa mites are known to harbor many viruses for which honey bees are susceptible and permissive. The parasitic mites attach themselves to honey bees externally and feed off of the hemolymph of their hosts. This exchange of fluids between the parasitic mites and the hosts allows for CBPV particles to enter fluid transfer systems in the honey bee body. The mechanisms by which chronic bee paralysis virus gains entry into honey bee cells is currently unknown.  Replication  Like other positive sense single-stranded RNA viruses, Chronic bee paralysis virus replicates in the cytoplasm of honeybee cells. The first large (+) RNA fragment in the CBPV genome likely encodes for an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which makes many copies of viral RNA. After many copies of the genome have been produced, the honey bee host's cellular processes will translate the viral RNA into functional proteins which can cause propagation of the virus inside the host. The virus replicates at the highest levels in the head of the honeybee, reaching an average of 107 copies of the virus in an infected worker bee head and as many as 1011 copies of the virus in an infected queen bee head. Chronic bee paralysis virus particles have been found to concentrate in two centers; in mushroom bodies which play a role in sensory processing, memory, and learning as well as in the central body, which plays a vital role in coordinating movement. Loss of flying ability in honey bees as a result of CBPV infection can be attributed to neuron destruction in the central body. Erratic behavior in infected bees may be a result of mushroom body neuron destruction.  Symptoms  Infected honeybees will begin to show symptoms of the illness within five days of infection, and the infection presents in two distinct ways, with Type I infection being the more common of the two infection types. A Type I infected bee presents with a bloated abdomen due to a fluid-filled honey sac and weak or trembling wings. Type I infected honey bees tend to crawl on the ground or cluster near the entrance of the hive, as their weakened wings lead to an inability to fly. A Type II infected honey bee presents with complete abdominal hair loss, causing it to appear black and greasy. These bees are still able to fly 2‚Äì3 days after symptoms begin to appear, but they lose their ability to fly shortly before succumbing to the disease. A third type of infection that is a major contributor to the spread of the virus is an infection of CBPV in which the infected bee exhibits no symptoms of the illness. The infected bee does not present with any of the classic symptoms of the disease before death, and, as a result, is able to transmit the virus beyond its own hive.  Treatment  There is no known treatment for the disease currently. Often, infections of chronic bee paralysis virus die out on their own, but infected bees, if detected, must be removed from the hive immediately to lessen the chances of the virus spreading. Supplementing a smaller hive that has been severely affected by the virus with healthy bees from another colony can prevent colony collapse in struggling hives. The infection commonly surges in the winters rather than warmer months, for unknown reasons. Treating the hive against Varroa mites has also proven to be an effective preventive method against viral infection. While bees should not be medicated against mites as a preventative measure because mites are quick to develop resistance; however, once detected, mites can be eliminated with the use of pesticides. Common pesticides include Apistan, Formic Acid, Apiguard. Home remedies for exterminating mites in a bee hive also include dusting the hive floors as well as the honey bees themselves with powdered sugar in order to suffocate the mites. == Testing == Chronic bee paralysis virus is classified as an inapparent infection because there are few tell-tale symptoms that appear before the infection has progressed to a fatal degree. As many honey bees can become infected and either show symptoms days after the initial point of infection or fail to show any symptoms throughout the entire course of the illness, CBPV can infect entire hives before the virus is detected. Despite the use of infectivity and serological tests, these testing methods are often inaccurate and difficult to reproduce with consistent results. == Symbiotic relationships == Although Chronic bee paralysis virus mainly infects honey bees, the virus has also been found to replicate in two species of carnivorous ant, Camponotus vagus and Formica rufa. These carnivorous ants become infected with CBPV through two mechanisms: eating decomposing bees who harbor the virus or by independently collecting infected honeydew. While the virus does not cause any symptoms in the carnivorous ants, the commensal relationship between the virus and the ants allows the ants to serve as a reservoir for viral replication to occur. Chronic bee paralysis virus is also similar to slow bee paralysis virus and acute bee paralysis virus. Though CBPV does not fall into the same family as the other two viruses, it bears similarities to the other viruses because it causes paralysis as the fatal symptom of the infection. Slow bee paralysis, in contrast to Chronic bee paralysis virus, causes paralysis of the front two pairs of legs on honey bees (Apis mellifera), silkworms (Bombyx mori'), and bumble bees (Bombis spp.'). This paralysis eventually causes death in the infected insects. Slow bee paralysis virus is transmitted to hives through Varroa destructor mite infestations. Because of the similarities between the two viruses, Chronic bee paralysis virus is suspected to have the same mode of transmission. Chronic bee paralysis virus is also seen to interact with satellite viruses. The three short RNA segments of the viral genome are thought to be a satellite virus. Only in the presence of CBPV can the associated satellite virus proliferate. == References == Category:Bee diseases Category:Insect viral diseases Category:Positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses Category:Beekeeping ","title":"Chronic bee paralysis virus"},{"id":"46848067","text":"Taronga Zoo ferry wharf is located on the northern side of Sydney Harbour serving Taronga Zoo. ==Services== Taronga Zoo wharf is served by Sydney Ferries Taronga Zoo services operated by First Fleet and Emerald class ferries.

It was the lead single from the album. It has also appeared on several of the group's live and compilation albums, and has been covered by such artists as Vince Gill and My Morning Jacket. ==Lyrics and music== The lyrics tell of the singer's attempt to find the heroine Ophelia. The relationship between the singer and Ophelia is never made explicit. Author Craig Harris refers to her as the singer's old friend, while music critic Nick DeRiso considers her his lover. But he finds out that Ophelia has left town, apparently in a hurry. According to Band biographer Barney Hoskyns, the name Ophelia for the song did not come from Shakespeare's Hamlet but rather from Minnie Pearl's real name. But Shakespeare scholar Stephen M. Buhler sees some Shakespearean echoes in \\"Ophelia,\\" particularly related to Othello. In particular, Buhler sees hints that perhaps Ophelia is a black woman in a Southern town who was forced to flee because of Southern attitudes at the time towards interracial relationships with the white singer. Lyrics Buhler uses to support this view include the following, suggesting that the relationship between Ophelia and the singer was illegal: :Honey, you know we broke the rule :Was somebody up against the law? Lines such as the singer asking Ophelia to \\"please darken my door,\\" suggest to Buhler that the issue may be the color of Ophelia's skin. But according to Harris' interpretation, nostalgia is the key theme to the song. \\"Ophelia\\" is an uptempo song with similarities to earlier Band songs \\"The W.S. Walcott Medicine Show\\" from Stage Fright and \\"Life is a Carnival\\" from Cahoots. The song has a Dixieland flavor. DeRiso hears a combination of rustic and modern elements in the music. Levon Helm sings the lead vocal. According to Hoskyns, the song has \\"the same good-humoured regret with which [Helm] infused \\"Up on Cripple Creek.\\" Garth Hudson plays multiple instruments, including synthesizer and multiple brass and woodwind instruments, which contributes significantly to the Dixieland flavor. As a result of the success of Hudson's playing, DeRiso regards \\"Ophelia\\" as \\"Hudson‚Äôs triumph, his musical testament, his masterpiece.\\" Robertson plays a more prominent guitar part than he had typically played on earlier Band songs. According to Robertson, ‚ÄúThe chord progression on ‚ÄòOphelia' was something that could have come out of the 1930s. The storytelling was ancient and modern in the same breath. The full-on modernism in the sound, in the arrangement, was paramount in Garth‚Äôs experimentation. It is unquestionably one of his greatest feats, in my opinion, on any Band song.‚Äù ==Personnel== *Rick Danko ‚Äì bass guitar *Levon Helm ‚Äì drums, vocals *Garth Hudson ‚Äì organ, synthesizers, trumpet, horn, oboe, clarinet, flute *Richard Manuel ‚Äì organ, vocals *Robbie Robertson ‚Äì guitars ==Reception== According to The New Rolling Stone Album Guide critic Mark Kemp, \\"Ophelia\\" is one of three songs on Northern Lights ‚Äì Southern Cross, along with \\"Acadian Driftwood\\" and \\"It Makes No Difference,\\" on which \\"Robertson reclaims his reputation as one of rock's great songwriters.\\" ==Other appearances== \\"Ophelia\\" appeared on many Band live and compilation albums.

Alfred was born at Marryatville a son of Percy Wells and his wife Caroline (1831‚Äì1901), and was educated at Thomas Caterer's school in Norwood. In 1871 the family returned to England aboard the Yatala, which was wrecked off the coast of France en route, but without loss of life. He undertook further schooling in Surrey, then studied architecture in London, returning to Adelaide in 1879. He soon found employment with the Engineer-in- Chief's Department under H. C. Mais. He worked for a time with Edmund Wright before returning to the Architect-in-Chief's Department under E. J. Woods then with Ernest Bayer and Latham A. Withall. In 1885 Bayer left the partnership and Wells took his place. Withall and Wells were in 1885 responsible for two of Adelaide's outstanding structures: the Adelaide Arcade and the Jubilee Exhibition Building (demolished c. 1965), both of which sported ornamental domes. In 1888 Withall and his family left for Britain, never to return, and Wells ran the business alone, designing for the Adelaide Children's Hospital (now Women's and Children's Hospital) two structures which still stand: the Allen Campbell Building and the Angas Building. Other high-profile buildings for which he was responsible were the Adelaide Electric Supply Company's building (now Tandanya National Aboriginal Cultural Institute) on East Terrace, Brookman Building on Grenfell Street, Norwood Town Hall, Thebarton Town Hall, and the South Australian Hotel on North Terrace. He retired in 1926, and died at Memorial Hospital in 1935. ==Other activities== He served as councillor for the City of St. Peters and, like his father, was a prominent Freemason. ==Family== Wells married Gertrude E.

Mine ownership is limited to the Government of Tunisia, although operation by private entities is encouraged. ==History== Tunisian mines (1922) Mining has been practiced in the country since the times of the Berber, Roman, Arab, and French empires. In 1890, many areas were discovered for mining extractions. Zinc mining began in 1892, iron ore mining in 1906, and phosphate mining in 1996. In Parry's Carthage and Tunis: Past and present: In two parts (1869), he discusses mining during late Ottoman Tunisia: > There are in Tunisia two lead mines, slightly argentiferous, at Jeba and at > Jeladja. Some beds of iron are at Gebel Zerissa and in several other > mountains lying along the frontiers of Algeria. Most of the mines are > situated in the northwest part of the regency. Marine salt is taken from > several sebkas or shallow salt lakes, where it is embedded on the surface in > large quantities. Gebel Hadifa contains a considerable mine of rock salt. > Plaster and lime are extracted on a large scale in the central and southern > provinces, and soda is furnished, especially by the district of Cairwan.\\" During the colonial period, when Tunisia was a protectorate of France, mining was a major part of the economy, particularly in rural areas. Gendarmes were formed by the colonial police force and were used to suppress labor unrest, particularly during the Great Depression. This led to unemployment in the mining industry due to increased economic prices. By 1962, mining labor unions accounted for 11% of organized labor (second only to government employees). Jobs in mining began decreasing in Tunisia during the 1970s, as operations transitioned from underground mining to open-pit mining. Following the 2010 Tunisian Revolution in which President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali was deposed, mining in Tunisia declined. This was followed by nationwide labour disputes and strikes. Opposition to the hiring practices at the mines of the Compagnie des phosphates de Gafsa in Gafsa resulted in a protest at the operations lasting over six months. In 2011, further protests continued for more than three years at the mines in Moular√®s and Redeyef, resulting in blockaded roads and the halting of mining operations. ==Production and impact== A phosphate mine in Tunisia (c. 1930) Headquarters, Soci√©t√© du Djebel Djerissa (1907) Tunisia is the fifth largest exporter of phosphates in the world. Extraction of phosphate is the most important mining sector in the country, boosting the economy through exports by some 45%. The mineral sector as a whole contributes to 3% of the GDP. Iron ore is extracted at the underground mine at Djerissa and also at the open-pits of Tamera and Douaria; this activity is done by the Soci√©t√© du Djebel Djerissa, which is a public sector undertaking. Mining in Central Tunisia and the North-South axis area, covering an area of , is not fully developed, but iron ore is being extracted to a considerable degree. In the northeast of central Tunisia, extraction of fluorine and baryte have been very substantial. ==Legal framework== Mining and mineral exploration is legislated by the Tunisian Mining Code (law No. 2003‚Äì30 of April 28, 2003). Laws on fuel minerals are the Hydrocarbons Code (law No. 99‚Äì93 of August 17, 1999) and its supplement (law No. 2002‚Äì23 of February 2002). The government of Tunisia develops geological and geophysical maps through the National Office of Mines, and regulates all mining operations, which are government owned. Despite the public ownership of all mines in Tunisia, private operation of the mines is promoted by the National Office of Mines. When a mining operation is started, it is granted a five-year reprieve on taxation, followed by a 25% taxation on profits. ==Outlook== Production of phosphate rock and phosphate fertilizers are likely to increase with the commissioning of the Celamin and the TIFERT projects.

Since 2008, Bagley has been a co-host of the nationally syndicated Sirius XM show The Morning Drive on Sirius XM NASCAR Radio. ==Early years== Born in Salisbury, Maryland, Bagley grew up listening to NASCAR races on MRN radio and developed a fascination with the race lap-by-lap calls, \\"so much so that I used to have a box of Matchbox cars. We had a shag rug in the den and every Sunday I'd plug the radio in, set it on the floor and mat down the rug in the shape of whatever track they were racing at.

It is Cardiff's oldest grand hotel. ==History and description== The hotel, by C. E. Bernard, was built between 1864 and 1866. An opening dinner was held on 3 July 1866 attended by 60‚Äì70 influential local residents. The Royal Hotel was initially run by a Mr and Mrs Sprawson. At the time of its construction there was another Royal Hotel in Cardiff, known as the Old Royal Hotel and located in The Hayes. The new 1860s building was four storeys high (plus an attic) in an Italianate style. In 1890 an additional storey plus an attic were added to the corner of the building. This increased the number of bedrooms from 70 to 120, with a modern lift and servants rooms on floor six. On the first floor was a banqueting room to seat up to 400 diners. ===Captain Scott's farewell dinner=== Blue plaque to Captain R F Scott On 13 June 1910, two days before Robert Falcon Scott's ship departed from Cardiff for his ill-fated expedition to the Antarctic, a fundraising dinner for the expedition took place at the Royal Hotel, hosted by Cardiff Chamber of Commerce. A plaque next to the St Mary Street entrance commemorates the event. The first-floor function room in which the event took place (previously called the Alexandra Room) was renamed \\"The Captain Scott Room\\" in 1982, after a chance discovery of a menu from the banquet. The Cardiff-based Captain Scott Society was founded in 1983 as a result. ==21st century== The hotel closed in 2001 and underwent a full refurbishment in preparation for the centenary of Scott's farewell banquet in 2011. A new bar was opened, named Fitz's after Pat Fitzgerald, a baby who was abandoned in the lobby of the hotel in 1939 and subsequently adopted by a local steelworker and his wife. In 2013 a hive of honey bees was installed on the roof of the hotel and given its own room number, 6B. This followed an action plan produced by the Welsh Government to try and halt the decline of the honeybee. The 2015 edition of the Rough Guide to Wales says of the Royal Hotel \\"this Victorian building conceals a modern interior; the bold red-and- black furnished rooms and limestone-finished bathrooms are well appointed, if somewhat devoid of charm.\\" It currently offers 60 bedrooms. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:Hotel buildings completed in 1866 Category:Hotels in Cardiff Category:Grade II listed buildings in Cardiff Category:1866 establishments in Wales ","title":"Royal Hotel, Cardiff"},{"id":"46849404","text":"The 1951 All-SEC football team consists of American football players selected to the All-Southeastern Conference (SEC) chosen by various selectors for the 1951 college football season.

The sediment quality triad approach to determining pollution-induced degradation. The Science of the Total Environment 97/98: 815‚Äì825.] This evaluation focuses on three main components: 1.) sediment chemistry, 2.) sediment toxicity tests using aquatic organisms, and 3.) the field effects on the benthic organisms (Chapman, 1990). Often used in risk assessment, the combination of three lines of evidence can lead to a comprehensive understanding of the possible effects to the aquatic community (Chapman, 1997).[Chapman PM et al. 1997. General guidelines for using the Sediment Quality Triad. Marine Pollution Bulletin 34(6): 368‚Äì372.] Although the SQT approach does not provide a cause-and-effect relationship linking concentrations of individual chemicals to adverse biological effects, it does provide an assessment of sediment quality commonly used to explain sediment characteristics quantitatively. The information provided by each portion of the SQT is unique and complementary, and the combination of these portions is necessary because no single characteristic provides comprehensive information regarding a specific site (Chapman, 1997) == Components  Sediment chemistry === Sediment chemistry provides information on contamination, however it does not provide information of biological effects (Chapman, 1990). Sediment chemistry is used as a screening tool to determine the contaminants that are most likely to be destructive to organisms present in the benthic community at a specific site. During analysis, sediment chemistry data does not depend strictly on comparisons to sediment quality guidelines when utilizing the triad approach. Rather, sediment chemistry data, once collected for the specific site, is compared to the most relevant guide values, based on site characteristics, to assess which chemicals are of the greatest concern. This technique is used because no one set of data is adequate for all situations. This allows you to identify the chemicals of concern, which most frequently exceed effects-based guidelines. Once the chemical composition of the sediment is determined and the most concerning contaminants have been identified, toxicity tests are conducted to link environmental concentrations to potential adverse effects. === Sediment toxicity === Sediment toxicity is evaluated based on bioassay analysis. Standard bioassay toxicity tests are utilized and are not organism restricted (Chapman, 1997). Differences in mechanisms of exposure and organism physiology must be taken into account when selecting your test organisms, and you must be able to adequately justify the use of that organism. These bioassay tests evaluate effects based on different toxicological endpoints. The toxicity tests are conducted with respect to the chemicals of concern at environmentally relevant concentrations identified by the sediment chemistry portion of the triad approach. Chapman (1990) lists typically used endpoints, which include lethal endpoints such as mortality, and sublethal endpoints such as growth, behavior, reproduction, cytotoxicity and optionally bioaccumulation. Often pilot studies are utilized to assist in the selection of the appropriate test organism and end points. Multiple endpoints are recommended and each of the selected endpoints must adequately complement each of the others (Chapman, 1997). Effects are evaluated using statistical methods that allow for the distinction between responses that are significantly different than negative controls. If sufficient data is generated, minimum significant differences (MSDs) are calculated using power analyses and applied to toxicity tests to determine the difference between statistical difference and ecological relevance. The function of the toxicity portion of the triad approach is to allow you to estimate the effects in the field. While laboratory based experiments simplify a complex and dynamic environment, toxicity results allow the potential for field extrapolation. This creates a link of exposure and effect and allows the determination of an exposure- response relationship. When combined with the other two components of the Sediment Quality Triad it allows for a holistic understanding between cause and effect. === Field effects on benthic organisms === The analysis of field effects on benthic organisms functions to assess the potential for community based effects resulting from the identified contaminants. This is done because benthic organisms are sessile and location specific, allowing them to be used as accurate markers of contaminant effect (Chapman, 1990). This is done through conducting field-based tests, which analyze changes in benthic community structures focusing on changes in number of species, abundance, and percentage of major taxonomic groups (Chapman, 1997). Changes in benthic communities are typically quantified using a principle component analysis and classification (Chapman, 1997). There is no one specifically defined method for conducting these field assessments, however the different multivariate analysis typically produces results identifying relationships between variables when a robust correlation exists. Knowledge of the site-specific ecosystem and the ecological roles of dominant species within that ecosystem are critical to producing biological evidence of alteration in benthic community resultant of contaminant exposure. When possible, it is recommended to observe changes in community structure that directly relate to the test species used during the sediment toxicity portion of the triad approach in order to produce the most reliable evidence. === Bioaccumulation === Bioaccumulation should be considered during the utilization of the triad approach depending on the study goals. It preparation for measuring bioaccumulation, it must be specified if the test will serve to assess secondary poisoning or biomagnification (Chapman, 1997). Bioaccumulation analysis should be conducted appropriately based on the contaminants of concern (for example, metals do not biomagnify). This can be done with field- collected, caged organisms, or laboratory exposed organisms (Chapman, 1997). While the bioaccumulation portion is recommended, it is not required. However, it serves an important role with the purpose of quantifying effects due to trophic transfer of contaminants through consumption of contaminated prey. === Pollution-induced degradation === Site-specific pollution induced degradation is measured through the combination of the three portions of the sediment quality triad. The sediment chemistry, sediment toxicity, and the field effects to benthic organisms are compared quantitatively. Data is most useful when it has been normalized to reference site values by converting them to reference-to-ratio values (Chapman et al. 1986; Chapman 1989).[Chapman PM, Dexter RN, Cross SF, Mitchell DG. 1986. A field trial of the Sediment Quality Triad in San Francisco Bay. NOAA Tech. Memo. NOS OMA 25, 127 pp.][Chapman PM, 1989. Current approaches to developing sediment quality criteria. Environ. Toxicol. Chem., 8: 589‚Äì599.] The reference site is chosen to be the site with the least contamination with respect to the other sites sampled. Once normalized, data between portions of the triad are able to be compared even when large differences in measurements or units exits (Chapman, 1990). From the combination of the results from each portion of the triad a multivariate figure is developed and used to determine the level of degradation. == Methods and interpretation == No single method can assess impact of contamination- induced degradation of sediment across aquatic communities. Methods of each component of the triad should be selected for efficacy and relevance in lab and field tests. Application of the SQT is typically location-specific and can be used to compare differences in sediment quality temporally or across regions (Chapman, 1997). === Multiple lines of evidence === The SQT incorporates three lines of evidence (LOE) to provide direct assessment of sediment quality. The chemistry, toxicity, and benthic components of the triad each provide a LOE, which is then integrated into a Weight of evidence.  Criteria  In order to qualify for SQT assessment chemistry, toxicity, and in situ measurements must be collected synoptically using standardized methods of sediment quality. A control sample is necessary to evaluate impact of contaminated sites. An appropriate reference is a whole sediment sample (particles and associated pore water) collected near area of concern and is representative of background conditions in the absence of contaminants.Evidence of contaminant exposure and biological effect is required in order to assign a site as chemically impacted.  Framework  The chemistry component incorporates both bioavailability and potential effects on benthic community. The potential of sediment toxicity for a given site is based on a linear regression model (LRM). A chemical score index (CSI) of the contaminant describes the magnitude of exposure relative to benthic community disturbance. An optimal set of index-specific thresholds are selected for the chemistry component by statistically comparing several candidates to evaluate which set exhibited greatest overall agreement (Bay and Weisberg, 2012).[Bay SM, Weisberg SB. 2012. Framework for interpreting sediment quality triad data. Integrated Environmental Assessment and Management 8(4): 589‚Äì596.] The magnitude of sediment toxicity is determined by multiple toxicity tests conducted in the lab to complement chemistry component. Toxicity LOE are determined by the mean of toxicity category score from all relevant tests. Development of LOE for benthic component is based on community metrics and abundance. Several indices such as benthic response index (BRI), benthic biotic integrity (IBI), and relative biotic index (RBI) are utilized to assess biological response of the benthic community. The median score of all individual indices will establish benthic LOE. Each component of the triad is assigned a response category: minimal, low, moderate, or high disturbance relative to background conditions. Individual LOEs are ranked into categories by comparing test results of each component to established thresholds (Bay and Weisberg, 2012). Integration of benthos and toxicity LOE classify the severity and effects of contamination. LOE of chemistry and toxicity are combined to assign the potential of chemically- mediated effects. A site is assigned an impact category by integrating the severity of effect and the potential of chemically mediated effects. The conditions of individual sites of concern are assigned an impact category between 1 and 5 (with 1 being unimpacted and 5 being clearly impacted by contamination). The SQT triad can also classify impact as inconclusive in cases when LOE between components are in disagreement or additional information is required (Bay and Weisberg, 2012).  Triaxial graphs  SQT measurements are scaled proportionately by relative impact and visually represented on triaxial graphs. Evaluation of sediment integrity and interrelationships between components can be determined by the size and morphology of the triangle. The magnitude of the triangle is indicative of the relative impact of contamination. Equilateral triangles imply agreement among components. (USEPA, 1994)[US Environmental Protection Agency. 1994. ARCS Assessment Guidance Document. EPA 905-B94-002. Chicago, Ill.: Great Lakes National Program Office.] == Evaluation  Advantages of triad approach === The SQT approach has been praised for a variety of reasons as a technique for characterizing sediment conditions. Relative to the depth of information it provides, and the inclusive nature, it is very cost effective. It can be applied to all sediment classifications, and even adapted to soil and water column assessments (Chapman and McDonald 2005).[Chapman PM, McDonald BG. 2005. Using the Sediment Quality Triad (Sqt) in ecological risk assessment. Small- scale Freshwater Toxicity Investigations 2: 308‚Äì329.] A decision matrix can be employed such that all three measures be analyzed simultaneously, and a deduction of possible ecological impacts be made (USEPA 1994) Other advantages of the SQT include information on the potential bioaccumulation and biomagnifcation effects of contaminants, and its flexibility in application, resulting from its design as a framework rather than a formula or standard method. By using multiple lines of evidence, there are a host of ways to manipulate and interpret SQT data (Bay and Weisberg 2012). It has been accepted on an international scale as the most comprehensive approach to assessing sediment (Chapman and McDonald 2005). The SQT approach to sediment testing has been used in North America, Europe, Australia, South America, and the Antarctic. === Application to sediment management standards === Stemming from the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) EPA permitting guidelines, point and nonpoint discharges may adversely affect sediment quality. As per state regulatory criteria, information on point and nonpoint source contamination, and its effects on sediment quality may be required for assessment of compliance. For example, Washington State Sediment Management Standards, Part IV, mandates sediment control standards which allow for establishment of discharge sediment monitoring requirements, and criteria for creation and maintenance of sediment impact zones (WADOE 2013).[Washington Department of Ecology. 2013. Sediment Management Standards. WAC 173‚Äì204. Olympia, WA: Toxics Cleanup Program.] In this instance, the SQT could be particularly useful encompassing multiple relevant analyses simultaneously. === Limitations and criticisms === Although there are numerous benefits in using the SQT approach, drawbacks in its use have been identified. The major limitations include: lack of statistical criteria development within the framework, large database requirements, difficulties in chemical mixture application, and data interpretation can be laboratory intensive (Chapman 1989). The SQT does not evidently consider the bioavailability of complexed or sediment-associated contaminants (FDEP 1994).[Florida Department of Environmental Protection. 1994. Approach to the Assessment of Sediment Quality in Florida Coastal Waters. Volume 1-Development and Evaluation of Sediment Quality Assessment Guidelines. Tallahassee, FL: Office of Water Policy.] Lastly, it is difficult to translate laboratory toxicity results to biological effects seen in the field (Kamlet 1989).[Kamlet KS. 1989. Contaminated marine sediments: assessment and remediation.

The film was produced by Prasad V. Potluri under the banner PVP cinema, it features Mahesh Babu, Kajal Aggarwal, Samantha Ruth Prabhu and Pranitha Subhash in lead roles. Mickey J. Meyer composed the film's music and Gopi Sundar scored the background music. R. Rathnavelu and Kotagiri Venkateswara Rao handled the film's cinematography and editing, respectively. Released on 20 May 2016, the film received unfavourable response from both critics and the audience, and failed at the box office. ==Plot== Many characters in this film were either unnamed or given informal names. The movie runs in Samantha Akkineni's narration. Chantibabu (Sathyaraj), a well established paint business entrepreneur and well-respected persona in family and society, lives in Vijayawada with his wife Mahalakshmi (Revathi) and son Babu (Mahesh Babu), a friendly and charming bachelor who looks after his father's business and his younger daughter lives in London with her husband. Mahalakshmi is the foster daughter of Rohini Hattangadi, and her four stepbrothers Peddabbai (Rao Ramesh), Naresh, Sayaji Shinde, and Krishna Bhagavan run the business with Chantibabu. Although their families live in different houses, they celebrate every occasion together. Peddabbai, Mahalakshmi's eldest stepbrother, is envious about his brother-in-law's fame as his father lends Chantibabu 400 rupees for his business establishment. Everyone confers the credit to Chantibabu. Peddabbai stays separate from the crowd and celebration. His wife Rajyalakshmi (Jayasudha) suggests marrying their daughter (Pranitha Subhash) to Babu to reduce his pain. Peddabbai struggles on how to put this idea in front of his brother-in-law. Chantibabu comes to know of his intentions and decides to speak with Babu. Enters Kasi Annapurna (Kajal Aggarwal), a free-spirited NRI from Australia who comes to India. Her father (Subhalekha Sudhakar) was a friend to Chantibabu and drops her at their home. Babu and Kasi develop feelings for each other but differ on the idea of living with family as Kasi loves to live more individually and wants to explore more in life. The family goes on a tour to Ooty, where Kasi expresses her thoughts to Babu, and they decide to break up. Before bidding goodbye, the two kiss. Peddabbai then leaves Ooty. This worries Chantibabu, so he calls everyone home to settle down the disturbances. Peddabbai bursts out on Chantibabu and asks to leave him and his family. Saddened, Chantibabu dies. Babu's sister's friend (Samantha Akkineni) from London visits the family while on her way to Brahmotsavam. Babu tries to rebuild the relation with Peddabbai, which does not work. He leaves for a road trip with Samantha. He meets, interacts, and shares experiences with his distant relatives of seven generations. In the due course, he and Samantha get closer and meet Peddabbai, who is now a big shot. Pranitha is about to get hooked with a minister's son. Peddabbai willingly does this to show off but wants Babu to be his son-in-law. He reaches Samantha Ruth Prabhu and asks her to leave Babu for the sake of her daughter. Respecting his words, she leaves for Brahmotsavam, kissing Babu tearfully. Peddabbai decides to go after the minister's son alliance. He holds a grand wedding and does not invite Babu and Mahalakshmi. In order to keep his father's pride, Babu and Mahalakshmi go to the marriage. Peddabbai insults them. After a series of confrontations, he comes to know that Chantibabu has left the whole property on his name, stating \\"Peddabbai was there in each and every moment of his life, in his good and bad times, and he is completely worth it\\". Peddabbai cries kneel-down in front of Babu and apologises to him.

Mahesh was impressed with Addala's new script and accepted to work with him after completing his existing commitments. Addala worked on the film's script for more than a year. The filming was expected to begin in May 2015 once Mahesh completes the shoot of Srimanthudu (2015). The film was tentatively titled as Brahmotsavam and Addala said in late December 2014 that it would be a family drama adding that he would begin the casting process soon. Prasad V. Potluri accepted to bankroll the film under the banner PVP Cinema and wanted Mahesh to sign a three-film deal once he returns from his holiday in Dubai; this film being the first of the three and the remaining two in 2016. On 8 January 2015, Addala told IANS that the film is almost confirmed and added that it is too early to share any more information. Mahesh chose to act in this film disregard to the box office performance of Addala's previous film Mukunda (2014) and the film was expected to be a romantic entertainer. Mickey J. Meyer was signed in on to compose the film's music. R. Rathnavelu was confirmed as the film's director of photography in early May 2015. A special logo of the film's title featuring both Venkateswara feet and a poorna kumbham in addition was released on 30 May 2015, a day before the official launch ceremony. The poster confirmed A. Sreekar Prasad and Thota Tharani as the film's editor and art director respectively. An official statement from the makers confirmed that the film would be a bilingual shot simultaneously in Telugu and Tamil with the same title, marking Mahesh's first direct Tamil film. After opining that the script has the potential to commercially succeed in both the languages without making much changes, Mahesh accepted the proposal of a Telugu-Tamil bilingual. However, the plan was later on dropped. === Casting === The makers tried to approach Rajinikanth for a brief yet key role as per the film's script. They approached Rakul Preet Singh to play the female lead and she evinced interest to be a part of the film after the first round of discussions. The film's team announced a casting call on 4 March 2015 for male and female characters; the requirements being an age group of 15 ‚Äì 50 years and four photographs two full size and close up photographs each. A source from the film's unit reported Samantha Ruth Prabhu as one of the three female leads of the film in a statement to IANS on 15 April 2015, adding that Taapsee Pannu and Pranitha Subhash were called for a look test on the next day for the other two female lead roles. Of the three female lead roles, the first two reportedly would have full-length roles while the third would pale in comparison. Sources close to the film's unit later added that parallel, wide open discussions were on regarding the female lead selection where a section of the technicians believe that fresh faces should be cast opposite Mahesh while a few opted for the inclusion of established female leads. A 30-day audition was held at Hyderabad from mid-April 2015. Mahesh, however, insisted that he would work with the actresses whose pairing with him received positive response from his fans. Rakul Preet Singh's manager confirmed her inclusion as one of the three female leads days later to the media. Though she denied signing the film during the promotions of Pandaga Chesko (2014), an official statement confirmed her and Pranitha as the female leads. Jayasudha, Rao Ramesh and Tanikella Bharani were confirmed as a part of the film's supporting cast during the official launch ceremony. The makers chose Sathyaraj to play Mahesh's father in the film. The film's unit told IANS that his presence in a major role would appeal to Tamil audience as the film was promoted as a Telugu-Tamil bilingual. Mannara was rumoured to be approached by the makers for the second female lead role. The film's executive producer Rajiv later revealed that Mannara was never approached for any character in the film. Rajiv added that her manager approached the makers for a role after the rumour began spreading and they rejected the proposal as no character suited her. Samantha replaced Rakul Preet Singh in mid June 2015 after the latter failed to adjust her callsheet due to scheduling conflicts. Brahmaji inclusion in the film's cast was confirmed in late June 2015. Kajal Aggarwal told IANS on 28 June 2015 that she has been signed as one of the film's female leads. At the same time, a press release confirmed the inclusion of Revathi and Naresh in the film's supporting cast. The former of the two was reported to play Mahesh's mother in the film. Also, Pranitha's character was reported to be a cameo appearance. Tulasi joined the film's supporting cast in early July 2015, and was chosen to play Kajal's mother in the film. Chandini Chowdary was signed to make a cameo appearance in late September 2015. Pavani Gangireddy was signed to play Mahesh's sister in the film, which she called a \\"more than the typical token hero's sister\\". In December 2015, Kajal revealed that she would be seen as a Non-resident Indian in the film, adding that Brahmotsavam \\"is largely based on characters and not on leads\\" and that in the ensemble cast, each character is crucial in the film. At the same time, PVP Cinema announced another casting call for real life families who are interested in participating in the film's shoot. Saranya Ponvannan inclusion in the film's cast was confirmed in mid-February 2016. In mid March 2016, Pranitha revealed that she plays a girl-next-door character of a traditional Telugu girl from a very protective family who consider herself a very bubbly girl who takes only the good from any situation that comes my way in life and will be seen sporting simple kurtis and patiala pants. She further revealed that it will be the typical bava-maradalu (cousins) connection that we find in a Telugu household. === Filming === Principal photography commenced on 31 May 2015. Mahesh allotted ninety days of call sheet without any lengthy breaks for the Spider which was expected to be wrapped up by December 2015. The filming was delayed as Mahesh was busy promoting Srimanthudu and was expected to resume from late August 2015. The regular filming commenced on 16 September 2015 with a song shot in a set erected by Tharani and a crew of 513 members at Ramoji Film City. Mahesh along with 21 other artistes participated in the song's shoot. Raju Sundaram choreographed the song on which 35 million was spent. The first schedule was wrapped up on 30 September 2015. The second schedule commenced on 5 October 2015 at Ramoji Film City in another set. After taking a two-week break, Mahesh joined the film's sets in Hyderabad in early November 2015. The makers wanted to complete most of the film's shoot in the fresh schedule commenced, as many actors and actresses were involved. Filming continued at Ramoji Film City and Sathyaraj joined the film's sets in mid November 2015. Few scenes on Mahesh and Kajal were filmed at Chilkur before wrapping up the schedule. A fresh schedule commenced from 28 November 2015 again at Ramoji Film City. Upon its completion, filming continued at Ooty from 12 December 2015. After filming scenes on Mahesh, Sathyaraj and Pranitha, a song was filmed on the principal cast in a set erected by Tharani. The schedule was wrapped up by the end of December 2015. Apart from the Ambattur industrial estate, the film was shot in and round Chennai from 11 to 15 January 2016. By then, 60% of the film shooting was wrapped up. The next schedule commenced from 19 January 2016 at Hyderabad. Brahmotsavam was later filmed in Varanasi from 1 March 2016, to 13 March 2016 before shifting to New Delhi and Udaipur for further shoot. The completion of the schedule meant wrapping up the principal photography, except for a song and few patchwork scenes which were planned to be filmed in Hyderabad. This North India schedule was wrapped up on 14 March 2016. == Themes == The film was considered to be a film glorifying Mahesh's on screen image as a lovable boy and a responsible son. During the film's official launch ceremony, Addala spoke about the film's theme by stating, \\"There would be beauty and happiness if some people are together. If there is a family with many members and if they celebrate every moment like a Utsavam, it is a Brahmotsavam\\", adding that the film's story would be on the lines of his previous directorial Seethamma Vakitlo Sirimalle Chettu (2013) which featured Mahesh and Samantha in the lead roles along with Daggubati Venkatesh and Anjali. A source from the film's unit revealed that Brahmotsavam is all about family values and celebrating traditions. The bonding between the protagonist and his father along with the backdrop of his mother's family are the centerpiece of the film. The three female leads play an important role in the manner in which the protagonist realises the value of family when they go out on a journey exploring the family lineage and their place in the larger scheme of family links. == Music == Mickey J. Meyer was signed to compose the film's soundtrack and background score. In early March 2015, Meyer recorded a song whose vocals were provided by Abhay Jodhpurkar. Later, the team approached Gopi Sundar to score the background music for this film. The film's audio was launched in a grand ceremony on 7 May at JRC Convention Center. A suit for damages of Rs. 25 lakhs was filed against the makers for copying the first 36 seconds of the Tulu song A...lele...yereg madme by Dr. Vamana Nandaavara found in the Deepanalike CD composed for Siri channel. The song was used in the movie in a sequence involving the lead actor who while accompanying his family on a tour dances to the tune of the hit Tulu song.http://epaper.udayavani.com/archive/home.php?edition=Sudina%20(Mangalore)&date;=2017-03-23&pageno;=6&pid;=UVANI_MAN == Release == The makers aimed for a Dusherra release in the film's pre- production stage clashing with Ram Charan' Bruce Lee: The Fighter, and Nandamuri Balakrishna Dictator, his 99th film as an actor. Later, Addala announced a worldwide release of Sankranthi 2016 in an interview with IANS in early May 2015. In November 2015, the film's release was postponed to 8 April 2016. Shortly, the film's release date was altered to 13 May 2016. The film is now scheduled to release on 20 May 2016 and the songs were released on 7 May. ===Critical reception=== The Hindu gave it a 2.5/5 and calling it as a \\"discomforting monotony\\".

Bleymaier was previously an athletic director, first at Boise State University from 1982 to 2011 and San Jose State from 2012 to 2017. ==Early life and education== Born in Boise, Idaho, Bleymaier attended its Borah High School and played football for the Lions under head coach De Pankratz on undefeated state championship teams (the win streak ended in October 1971 at 34 games). After graduation in 1971, he attended the University of California, Los Angeles and lettered on the UCLA Bruins football team from 1972 to 1974. He played under head coach Pepper Rodgers for his first two seasons; as a senior under new head coach Dick Vermeil in 1974, Bleymaier made 13 catches for 245 yards and one touchdown as a tight end and was third-team All-Pac-8. Bleymaier graduated from UCLA in 1975 with a bachelor's degree in sociology and was named \\"outstanding senior\\" by the UCLA Alumni Association. He then attended Loyola Law School and graduated with a J.D. in 1978. ==Administrative careerUCLA (1976‚Äì1981)=== Bleymaier became assistant athletic director at UCLA in 1976, while attending law school, and supervised academic affairs for student-athletes, including financial aid and tutoring. ===Boise State (1981‚Äì2011)=== In June 1981, Boise State University hired Bleymaier as assistant athletic director; longtime athletic director Lyle Smith had recently retired and Mike Mullally of Cal State Fullerton succeeded him. After a flap with boosters over new season ticket premiums, Mullally resigned after less than a year in Boise and Bleymaier was promoted to athletic director by university president John Keiser in March 1982. At Boise State, Bleymaier oversaw three conference changes. In 1996, Boise State moved from the Big Sky Conference to the Big West Conference, followed by the Western Athletic Conference (WAC) in 2001 and Mountain West Conference (MWC) in 2011. As a member of the WAC, Boise State won 32 conference championships, including eight in football. Throughout the 2000s, Boise State was a Top 100 contender for the Learfield Sports Director's Cup, a national award for the most successful college athletics department. The football program moved up to Division I-A in 1996 and rose to a national brand under head coaches Dirk Koetter (1998‚Äì2000), Dan Hawkins (2001‚Äì2005), and Chris Petersen (2006‚Äì2013). In Petersen's first season in 2006, the Broncos were undefeated (13‚Äì0), upset the Oklahoma Sooners in the Fiesta Bowl, and were fifth in the final AP Poll. The 2009 team also was undefeated (14‚Äì0) and were fourth in the final AP Poll, the highest in school history. Boise State coaches also earned 31 \\"Coach of the Year\\" honors in the 2000s. Bleymaier was responsible for the trademark blue turf at Bronco Stadium, introduced in 1986. In 1997, he established the Humanitarian Bowl (now the Famous Idaho Potato Bowl) football game hosted by Boise State. On August 11, 2011, BSU president Bob Kustra fired Bleymaier, following an NCAA investigation involving 22 rules violations by the Boise State women's tennis, men's tennis, track and field, and football programs. The following month, the NCAA placed Boise State on three years of probation and reduced football scholarships, among other sanctions. Bleymaier had served thirty years at the university, 29 as athletic director. ===San Jose State (2012‚Äì2017)=== In May 2012, San Jose State University president Mohammad Qayoumi hired Bleymaier as the university's new athletic director effective June 30; Bleymaier was the only candidate interviewed. At San Jose State, Bleymaier led the athletics department's move from the WAC to MWC and addition of new women's sports, sand volleyball and indoor and outdoor track. Additionally, Bleymaier has overseen fundraising for the proposed Vermeil-Walsh Athletic Center, to be constructed at the north end zone of Spartan Stadium. Bleymaier has also set a goal to upgrade facilities for baseball, softball, soccer, golf, tennis, and track. In the 2012‚Äì13 academic year, his first as athletic director, San Jose State experienced a very successful year, with football at 11‚Äì2 and were ranked in the final AP and BCS rankings for the first time in school history. It marked the football team's first 11-win season since 1940 and best record since a 10‚Äì2 season in 1987. The women's swimming, women's tennis, and softball teams all won WAC titles. These achievements led San Jose State to be ranked a historically high 106th of 295 NCAA Division I programs in the 2013 final Learfield Sports Director's Cup rankings. In September 2012, Bleymaier hired Dave Nakama as baseball head coach, following the retirement of Sam Piraro. That first year, Bleymaier also hired several head coaches who began their tenures in the 2013‚Äì14 school year. In December 2012, after head football coach Mike MacIntyre left for Colorado, Bleymaier hired UCLA alum and University of San Diego head coach Ron Caragher as head coach. In March 2013, Bleymaier fired men's basketball head coach George Nessman and hired Boise State assistant coach Dave Wojcik to replace Nessman. Under Caragher, San Jose State football went 6‚Äì6 in 2013 and 3‚Äì9 in 2014. Under Wojcik, men's basketball went 7‚Äì24 in 2013‚Äì14, then 2‚Äì28 in 2014‚Äì15. Baseball has gone under Nakama, including a last-place finish in the Mountain West in 2015. In September 2013, following the surprise resignation of women's basketball head coach Tim La Kose, Bleymaier hired Sacramento State head coach Jamie Craighead. Under Craighead, the Spartans improved from 11‚Äì19 in 2013‚Äì14 to 15‚Äì17 in 2014‚Äì15, including a run to the semifinals of the 2015 Mountain West Tournament that followed an upset of #1 seed Colorado State. Following the retirement of women's volleyball head coach Oscar Crespo after the 2013 season, Bleymaier hired Jolene Shepardson of Cal State Bakersfield in January 2014. In 2017, Bleymaier was reassigned in February as special advisor to SJSU president Mary Papazian, focusing on South Campus athletic facility renovations. Bleymaier's deputy Marie Tuite became interim athletic director, pending a national search for a long-term replacement. ==ReferencesExternal links== *San Jose State University Athletics ‚Äì Gene Bleymaier Category:1953 births Category:Living people Category:American football tight ends Category:Boise State Broncos athletic directors Category:San Jose State Spartans athletic directors Category:UCLA Bruins football players Category:Loyola Law School alumni Category:Sportspeople from Boise, Idaho Category:California lawyers ","title":"Gene Bleymaier"},{"id":"46849688","text":"Thonburi University Stadium () is a multi-purpose stadium in Bangkok, Thailand.

According to the locals, the cause of the confrontation was a dispute over a 30-year-old mosque. In 2009 the Hindus of the village claimed that it was the property of the village Panchayat. The Muslims said the land belonged to the Waqf board. In March 2015, the Faridabad court ruled in favour of the Muslim community. The Hindus however, continued to raise objections, with some advocating the demolition of the mosque because it stood adjacent to a temple.[1][4] ==Aftermath== A mass of 2000 people attacked the village using swords, bricks, and fire as weapons of choice. The mosque was torched and the Muslims of the village fled. Muslims believe that they were selectively targeted, citing instances such as the only shop burned in a vendor's market belonged to Muslim merchants and only the homes of Muslims were looted. An estimated 400 Muslims were displaced from their homes, many of them slept in the police station in the neighboring village of Ballabgarh. The following day, Muslims began to protest at the Ballabgarh police station because no one had been arrested in relation to the crimes. One month later, still no charges have been brought upon those who committed the attacks. ==References== ‡§Æ‡§Ç‡§¶‡§ø‡§∞-‡§Æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§ú‡§ø‡§¶ ‡§ï‡§æ ‡§´‡§∏‡§æ‡§¶, ‡§Ö‡§ü‡§æ‡§≤‡•Ä ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§®‡§´‡§∞‡§§ ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§Ü‡§ó - ‡§™‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡§ï‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡§µ‡§£ ‡§∂‡•Å‡§ï‡•ç‡§≤ ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§µ‡§ø‡§∂‡•á‡§∑ ‡§∞‡§ø‡§™‡•ã‡§∞‡•ç‡§ü, ‡§§‡§∏‡•ç‡§µ‡•Ä‡§∞‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§ï‡•á ‡§∏‡§æ‡§•-3 ‡§ú‡•Ç‡§®,2015 ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§∞‡§ø‡§™‡•ã‡§∞‡•ç‡§ü Category:2015 riots Ballabhgarh Category:Persecution by Hindus ","title":"2015 Ballabhgarh riot"},{"id":"46849817","text":"Jacqueline Simoneau (born September 29, 1996) is a Canadian synchronized swimmer. == Career == In 2011, Simoneau won a gold medal in the Solo and Duet events, and a silver medal in the Figure event at the 2011 UANA Pan American Championships.

The match was contested by Arsenal, the 2014‚Äì15 FA Cup winners, and Chelsea, champions of the 2014‚Äì15 Premier League. It was held at Wembley Stadium on 2 August 2015. Watched by a crowd of 85,437 and a television audience of over a million, Arsenal won the match 1‚Äì0. This was Arsenal's 21st Shield appearance and Chelsea's 11th. Petr ƒåech made his competitive debut for Arsenal against his former team, while captain Mikel Arteta and striker Olivier Giroud were named as substitutes. Gary Cahill was passed fit to start for Chelsea alongside captain John Terry, and Lo√Øc R√©my started up-front as Diego Costa was absent. The only goal of the match came near the midway point of the first half; Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain collected a pass from Theo Walcott from the right and scored past Thibaut Courtois. Both managers did not shake hands after the game, which drew media attention. Arsenal's victory was their first against Chelsea in over three years and manager Ars√®ne Wenger's first over Jos√© Mourinho in 14 attempts. ==Background and pre-match== Arsenal's victory parade after winning the 2015 FA Cup Final, which qualified them for the Community Shield. The FA Community Shield was founded in 1908 as a successor to the Sheriff of London Charity Shield, and began as a contest between the respective champions of the Football League and Southern League, although in 1913 it was played between an Amateurs XI and a Professionals XI. In 1921, it was played by the league champions of the top division and FA Cup winners for the first time. Chelsea qualified for the 2015 FA Community Shield as winners of the 2014‚Äì15 Premier League. It was the club's fourth league title in ten years and third under the management of Jos√© Mourinho. The other Community Shield place went to Arsenal, who defeated Aston Villa by four goals to win the 2015 FA Cup Final and retain the trophy. In doing so, Arsenal had overtaken Manchester United to become the most successful club in the competition's history, with 12 titles. Chelsea made their eleventh appearance in the Community Shield; prior to this they won four (1970, 2000, 2005, 2009) and lost six, most recently in 2012 against Manchester City. By contrast, Arsenal made their 21st Community Shield appearance, and won 13, including one shared in 1991. They went into the match as holders of the Shield, having defeated Manchester City a year earlier. Both clubs had only once met before in the Shield, when Chelsea won by two goals to one in 2005. Arsenal had failed to beat Chelsea in all competitions since 2011, and Mourinho was undefeated against his opponent Ars√®ne Wenger in 13 matches. Mourinho told reporters a winless run was something he would not tolerate: ‚ÄúI would try to answer, not because of a mental block but because I would want to try to find solutions to help my team to do it ‚Äì try to find a different way, try to find the reasons why it goes all the time against my team.\\" He also attempted to play down the significance of the match, given Arsenal had won the previous year's contest but finished third in the league. The match was televised live in the United Kingdom on BT Sport 2; the network obtained rights to the Community Shield in July 2013 and were into their second year of a deal with the BBC and the FA. The game was also the inaugural broadcast of BT Sport's 4K ultra HD feed. ==MatchTeam selection=== Chelsea were predicted to line up in a 4‚Äì2‚Äì3‚Äì1 formation, with Willian and Eden Hazard as wide men. Mourinho doubted the fitness of Diego Costa and Gary Cahill going into the match ‚Äì the former aggravated his hamstring during a pre-season game against Barcelona. Arsenal were expected to line up similarly to Chelsea, with Walcott furthest forward and Mesut √ñzil in his preferred position as playmaker. Midfielder Jack Wilshere was ruled out of selection, having sustained an ankle injury during training. Arsenal's top scorer of the previous season, Alexis S√°nchez, was rested, having won the 2015 Copa Am√©rica with Chile earlier in the summer. The teamsheets showed Lo√Øc R√©my starting the match for Chelsea up front and Cesc F√†bregas partnering Matic in midfield. As expected Petr ƒåech started in goal for Arsenal; the goalkeeper moved from Chelsea in search of first-team football. ===Summary=== First half Chelsea's Lo√Øc R√©my and Nemanja Matiƒá and the Arsenal defence Chelsea, in their usual home strip of blue, kicked off the match and immediately lost possession when Walcott dispossessed Matic. Walcott sent the ball to Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, whose cross on the right forced a punch from Thibaut Courtois. Francis Coquelin conceded a free kick in the sixth minute having fouled Willian inside Chelsea's half, though nothing came of the set piece. F√†bregas went down under the challenge of Per Mertesacker in Arsenal's penalty area soon afterwards, but his appeal for a penalty kick was turned down by referee Anthony Taylor and play resumed. Chelsea, having settled the slower of the two teams, began to dominate ball possession and won two early corners, both of which were easily dealt with. In the 17th minute, Nacho Monreal's charge forward was stopped by Cahill; the Chelsea defender in the process of making that challenge had suffered a nose bleed. A free kick for Arsenal presented a chance for Walcott to score, but his header goalwards was saved. Arsenal scored the game's only goal in the 24th minute; set-up by Walcott, Oxlade-Chamberlain managed to cut inside C√©sar Azpilicueta on the right and shoot the ball into the top-left corner of Courtois's net. It was the first goal Chelsea had conceded against Arsenal in 506 minutes. Most of the action in the first half was conducted in a congested midfield, with F√†bregas attempting to sedate the rhythm and the Arsenal midfielders forcing their opponents to play narrow. This favoured Arsenal, who had space to counter- attack had Chelsea lost the ball. Ramires nearly levelled the scoreline in the 33rd minute, but his curling effort failed to creep into the bottom right-hand corner. Ramires then missed another chance, heading the ball high and over the Arsenal goal after good work by R√©my. Arsenal created another chance to score four minutes before the break, when Oxlade-Chamberlain's cross found Monreal, who under pressure from Ivanovic headed over. R√©my, often a lone figure upfront, was ruled offside late on. Second half Chelsea's Willian (left) and Radamel Falcao, who made his professional debut for the club. Radamel Falcao replaced R√©my after the break and his long-range shot in the 48th minute was blocked. Although Chelsea started the half well, it was Arsenal who fashioned the notable chances before the hour mark. In the 50th minute Santi Cazorla attempted to thread the ball through Chelsea's defence for Walcott to reach but his pass was cleared. Two minutes later Coquelin over-hit his pass which was directed to √ñzil, who roamed freely. Chelsea made another change, this time Oscar in place of Ramires in the 53rd minute. Seven minutes later Chelsea came close to scoring when Eden Hazard managed to evade his markers, but through on goal failed to get his shot on target, hitting over. Azpilicueta was shown the game's first yellow card for pulling Oxlade- Chamberlain back; Mourinho made the decision to substitute him with Kurt Zouma in the 69th minute. Giroud came on for Walcott moments before, and immediately was involved in the action, shooting high and then from long range. Coquelin then was booked for his foul on Oscar, which earned Chelsea a free kick. Oscar's attempt was saved by ƒåech, who fisted the ball round the post. Chelsea continued to attack, though Arsenal withstood their pressure. John Terry rose highest from a corner in the 74th minute and headed the ball in Zouma's direction, which eventually was caught by ƒåech. Hazard's shot was blocked in the 79th minute and Oscar then spurned a chance, with Falcao unable to create something from it. In an effort to find an equaliser with ten minutes of normal time remaining, Mourinho brought on Moses in place of Terry and deployed a three-man defence. It nearly presented Arsenal the chance to score their second of the match, but for Cazorla to have his effort blocked and Aaron Ramsey on the rebound shooting wide. ===Details=== { style=\\"width:92%\\" -   } { style=\\"width:100%\\" - style=\\"vertical-align:top; width:40%;\\" { style=\\"font-size:90%\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" - !width=25 !!width=25 - GK 33 Petr ƒåech - RB 24 H√©ctor Beller√≠n - CB 4  Per Mertesacker (c) - CB 6  Laurent Koscielny - LB 18 Nacho Monreal - CM 34 Francis Coquelin  - CM 19 Santi Cazorla - RW16 Aaron Ramsey - AM 11 Mesut √ñzil   - LW 15 Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain   - CF 14 Theo Walcott   - colspan=\\"3\\"Substitutes: - GK 26 Emiliano Mart√≠nez - DF 2  Mathieu Debuchy - DF 3  Kieran Gibbs   - DF 5  Gabriel - MF 8  Mikel Arteta   - FW 12 Olivier Giroud   - FW 45 Alex Iwobi - colspan=\\"3\\"Manager: - colspan=\\"3\\" Ars√®ne Wenger } valign=\\"top\\"300px style=\\"vertical-align:top; width:50%;\\" { style=\\"font- size:90%;margin:auto\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" - !width=25 !!width=25 - GK 13 Thibaut Courtois - RB 2  Branislav Ivanoviƒá - CB 24 Gary Cahill - CB 26 John Terry (c)   - LB 28 C√©sar Azpilicueta   - CM 21 Nemanja Matiƒá - CM 4  Cesc F√†bregas - RW 7  Ramires   - AM 22 Willian - LW 10 Eden Hazard - CF 18 Lo√Øc R√©my   - colspan=\\"3\\"Substitutes: - GK 1  Asmir Begoviƒá - DF 5  Kurt Zouma   - MF 8  Oscar   - MF 11 Juan Cuadrado - MF 12 John Obi Mikel - MF 20 Victor Moses   - FW 9  Radamel Falcao   - colspan=\\"3\\"Manager: - colspan=\\"3\\" Jos√© Mourinho } } { style=\\"width:100%;font-size:90%\\"  Match officials: *Assistant referees: **Gary Beswick **John Brooks *Fourth official: Roger East (Wiltshire) style=\\"width:60%; vertical-align:top;\\" Match rules *90 minutes *Penalty shoot-out if scores still level *Seven named substitutes, of which six may be used } ===Statistics=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\"  - !scope=\\"col\\"Statistic !scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:70px\\"Arsenal !scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:70px\\"Chelsea - !scope=rowGoals scored 1 0 - !scope=rowPossession 43.4% 56.6% - !scope=rowShots on target 5 2 - !scope=rowShots off target 6 12 - !scope=rowCorner kicks 4 4 - !scope=rowFouls 12 11 - !scope=rowInterceptions 21 13 - !scope=rowOffsides 0 6 - !scope=rowYellow cards 1 1 - !scope=rowRed cards 0 0 - colspan=\\"3\\"Source: } ==Post-match== Wenger won his sixth Community Shield as Arsenal manager Wenger and Mourinho did not shake hands after the final whistle; Mourinho congratulated Arsenal's players as they descended the Wembley steps upon lifting the Shield, but the Arsenal manager appeared to avoid his Chelsea counterpart after he had collected his winner's medal. Asked about the incident, Mourinho said, \\"I shake the hands of everybody who left the stairs, right in front of my direction.\\" When asked about the incident, Wenger responded by saying \\"I shook a few hands today after the game, but nothing special there.\\" In a post-match interview, Mourinho credited Arsenal's defensive approach and organisation, but felt \\"the best team lost\\", arguing that Chelsea created more chances and showed more initiative. He went on to suggest that Arsenal betrayed their attacking philosophy, choosing to adopt a counterattacking approach. Although Wenger agreed his team were set-up cautiously, he denied they abandoned their playing style: \\"...we defend our game on togetherness and solidarity and on defending well and attacking well.\\" The Arsenal manager felt victory against Chelsea acted as a physiological boost for his players going into the new season, but was indifferent to his own record of beating Mourinho for the first time. Terry was disappointed with the result, observing \\"No matter if it‚Äôs a friendly or a Community Shield, it‚Äôs a trophy at the end of the day,\\" but sought positives ‚Äì focusing on how the players' fitness levels were rising in time for the new season. Mertesacker was delighted with his team's performance, describing it as the peak of their pre-season preparations. Both managers criticised the quality of the pitch; Mourinho remarked that it \\"was a disaster... so bad and so slow.\\" An FA spokesperson said: \\"We will continue to improve the quality of the pitch, which we have every confidence in. In this instance it is simply that the pitch is less mature than we would ordinarily wish given the summer concert season and the early start to the football calendar.\\" An average of 821,000 viewers watched the match live on BT Sport 2; the channel's coverage peaked at 1.2 million (11.5% of the audience share) from 16:40.

He is sometimes known as the first British pediatric neurosurgeon. He was the first physician to make a connection between shaking an infant and subsequent brain injury. ==Biography== Guthkelch was born outside London in Woodford Green. He wanted to become a veterinarian in early childhood, but he shifted his goal to becoming a physician by the second grade. He went to school at Christ's Hospital school, Horsham, UK. He studied at the University of Oxford, earning a medical degree. He was a registrar at the Manchester Royal Infirmary. Guthkelch worked at the Manchester Royal Infirmary, Salford Royal Hospital, Royal Manchester Children's Hospital and Hull Royal Infirmary. His early career was influenced by the neurosurgeon Sir Geoffrey Jefferson. Guthkelch has been described as the first pediatric neurosurgeon in Great Britain. Making the connection between subdural hematoma and babies who had sustained shaking injuries, Guthkelch published his conclusions in a 1971 British Medical Journal paper. He said that since there was no stigma associated with shaking infants in Northern England at that time, parents were frank with him that these injured infants had been shaken. Later, he was critical of the broad application of the shaken baby syndrome diagnosis in legal proceedings, saying that illnesses could sometimes cause similar issues to shaken baby syndrome. \\"In a case of measles, if you get the diagnosis wrong, in seven days' time it really doesn't matter because it's cleared up anyhow,\\" Guthkelch said. \\"If you get the diagnosis of fatal shaken baby syndrome wrong, potentially someone's life will be terminated.\\" In September 2015, he told Retro Report that he was \\"shocked\\" and \\"desperately disappointed\\" that prosecutors were using his science as a basis to convict people. Guthkelch retired from full-time clinical practice 1992 at University Health Sciences Center, Tucson, Arizona, Department of Neurosurgery. In 2009 he began reviewing cases in which people were charged with injuring children by shaking. The Society for Research into Hydrocephalus and Spina Bifida bestows the Norman Guthkelch Award upon a student or early career scientist involved in spina bifida or hydrocephalus research. Guthkelch lived in Ohio. He turned 100 in September 2015. On July 28, 2016 Guthkelch died at the age of 100 in Toledo, Ohio. ==See also== *List of centenarians (medical professionals) ==ReferencesExternal links== *Google Scholar citations Category:1915 births Category:2016 deaths Category:American centenarians Category:British centenarians Category:British surgeons Category:Alumni of the University of Oxford Category:People educated at Christ's Hospital ","title":"Norman Guthkelch"},{"id":"46849883","text":"The 1949 All-SEC football team consists of American football players selected to the All-Southeastern Conference (SEC) chosen by various selectors for the 1949 college football season.

Under a concession driven by the Australian Labor Party, agencies need to seek a warrant before a judicial officer before they are able to view the metadata of journalists, whilst ASIO will need to seek permission of the Attorney-General. The Abbott Government's decision to introduce a mandatory telecommunications data regime led to considerable community debate. It was supported by law enforcement and national security agencies, including the Australian Federal Police and ASIO, who argued telecommunications data is critical to criminal investigations and that it is only through legislation that they can be assured that it will be available. The decision was opposed by a wide range of groups and individuals including journalists, human rights organisations and civil liberties groups. Their objections were made on a number of grounds, such as the consequences for journalism and journalistic practice, the non-proportionate and increasing encroachment of the privacy of Australia's population, and the effectiveness of the regime as a tool to combat crime. Questions over its cost and the consequences for the telecommunications industry, in particular small to medium-sized providers, have also been raised as arguments against mandatory data retention. While the Act is law, telecommunications and ISPs have an 18-month grace period to improve their systems and establish processes to comply with the legislation. Telstra has indicated it will store data it retains within Australia, but other telcos and ISPs are not obligated to do so under the law. == Background  Access to telecommunications data prior to the Act === Under the previous regime set down under the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979 (the TIA Act), ‚Äòenforcement agencies‚Äô and ASIO could access telecommunications data through issuing an internal, or intra-organisation, authorisation. During the 2012-2013 inquiry into Australia's national security legislation conducted by the PJCIS, the Attorney General's Department issued a document detailing what it considered to be telecommunications data. This included \\"information that allowed a communication to occur\\", such as the date, time and duration of the communication, the devices involved in the communication, and the location of those devices such as mobile phone tower, and \\"information about the parties to the communication\\", such as their names and addresses. Section 5 of the Act defined an enforcement agency to include the Australian Federal Police (AFP), the police force of a State or Territory, the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service, crime commissions, anti-corruption bodies and the CrimTrac Agency. The definition also included an allowance enabling organisations whose remit either involves the administration of law involving a financial penalty or the administration of a law to protect taxation revenue to access telecommunications data. The head of an enforcement agency, the deputy head of an agency, or a management level officer or employee of an agency, given permission in writing by the head of the agency, had the power to authorise access to telecommunications data. For ASIO, authorisations for access to telecommunications data could only be made when the individual making the authorisation was \\"satisfied that the disclosure would be in connection with the performance by the Organisation of its functions\\". ASIO also had to comply with guidelines issued under Section 8A of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979. These guidelines demanded that the initiation and continuation of investigations only be authorised by the Director-General, or an officer at or above Executive Level 2 authorised by the Director-General for that purpose; and that any means used for obtaining information must be proportionate to the gravity of the threat posed and the probability of its occurrence. In 2012-13, more than 80 Commonwealth, State and Territory enforcement agencies accessed telecommunications data under the TIA Act. In that same period, more than 330,640 authorisations were dispensed allowing access to data. These authorisations resulted in 546,500 disclosures. === Proposals for reform === Since at least June 2010, it had been reported that the Australian Government was considering establishing a telecommunications data retention scheme. On 4 May 2012, the Gillard Government announced plans to review a range of national security legislation, including that covering \\"lawful access to telecommunications‚Ä¶ to ensure that vital investigative tools are not lost as telecommunications providers change their business practices and begin to delete data more regularly.\\" In July 2012 the Attorney-General's Department released \\"Equipping Australia against Emerging and Evolving Threats\\", a discussion paper focused on proposed national security reforms. The paper's first chapter outlined the terms of reference for an inquiry to be conducted by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security (PJCIS) into the potential reform of national security legislation, specifically the four following Acts: * Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979 * Telecommunications Act 1997 * Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979 * Intelligence Services Act 2001 The discussion paper grouped these proposals into three different categories: those the Government wished to progress, those the Government was considering, and those on which the Government was seeking the Committee's opinion. Though the paper contained eighteen proposals and forty- one individual reforms, the suggestion that carriage service providers (CSPs) be required to retain information on the way Australians use the internet and mobile phones elicited much consternation and comment from the community. This was a point the Committee highlighted in its final report to the Government: > \\"The potential data retention regime attracted a large amount of criticism > and comment from organizations and concerned individuals. These > organizations and individuals generally considered any potential data > retention regime a significant risk to both the security and their privacy. > In addition to these general comments, the Committee received a large volume > of form letter correspondence.\\" On 24 June 2013, the Committee issued its report and put the decision on whether to progress with a mandatory data retention scheme back in the Government's hands. On the same day the report was released, Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus announced the Government would not be pursuing its proposal. On 30 October 2014, the Abbott Government introduced the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment (Data Retention) Bill 2014 into the House of Representatives. On 21 November 2014, the Attorney-General Senator George Brandis wrote to the PJCIS, referring the provisions of the Bill for inquiry. Chaired by MP Dan Tehan, the Committee received 204 submissions, 31 supplementary submissions and held three public hearings. On 27 February 2015, the Committee presented its report, containing 39 recommendations. On 3 March 2015, the Government announced it would accept all the Committee's recommendations. However, the opposition Labor Party only agreed to support the passage of the Bill through the Senate after amendments were made to protect journalistic sources. On 26 March 2015, the Senate voted in favour of the Bill. On 13 April 2015, the Governor-General gave his royal assent and the Act entered into law. === PJCIS recommendations: 2013 and 2015 reports === In response to the need for available telecommunications data and growing national security threats, Attorney-General George Brandis asked the PJCIS to inquire into and report on the Act. The Committee handed down its report entitled Report of the Inquiry into Potential Reforms of Australia‚Äôs National Security Legislation (2013 PJCIS Report) on 24 June 2013, in which it made these recommendations: * The data retention obligation only applies to telecommunications data (not content) and internet browsing is explicitly excluded (Recommendation 42) * Service providers are required to protect the confidentiality of retained data by encrypting the information and protecting (Recommendation 42) * Mandatory data retention will be reviewed by the PJCIS no more than three years after its commencement (Recommendation 42) * The Commonwealth Ombudsman will oversight the mandatory data retention scheme and more broadly law enforcement exercise of powers under Chapter 3 and 4 of the TIA Act (Recommendations 4 and 42); and * Confining agencies‚Äô use of, and access to, telecommunications data through refined access arrangements, including a ministerial declaration scheme based on demonstrated investigative or operations need (Recommendation 5). The Act was again referred to the PJCIS for inquiry on 21 November 2014, where the Committee tabled its Advisory Report on the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment (Data Retention) Act 2014 (2015 PJCIS Report) on 25 February 2015. The PJCIS made these additional recommendations: * The implementation of a mandatory data retention regime is necessary to maintain the capability of national security and law enforcement agencies and recommended that the Act be passed (Recommendation 39) * Establish a ‚Äòjournalist information warrants‚Äô regime and restrict the agencies who can access this data (Recommendation 26 and 27) * Provide for record-keeping and reporting the use of, and access to, telecommunications data and enable the Commonwealth Ombudsman to assess agency compliance (Recommendation 29) * Amend the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979(Cth)to provide that certain matters relating to data retention be include in the ASIO Annual Report; and * Amend the Intelligence Services Act 2001(Cth) to enable to PJCIS to inquire into operation matters relating to the use of telecommunications data by ASIO and the Australian Federal Police, in relation to counter-terrorism function (Recommendation 34) On 3 March 2015, the Abbott Government announced that it would accept all of the above recommendations, and on 19 March 2015, the House of Representatives agreed to the amendments to the Act and to the Intelligence Services Act 2001, the Telecommunication Act 1997, and the Privacy Act 1988 and the Australia Security Intelligence Organisations Act 1979 to give effect to the 2015 PJCIS Report. The House of Representatives also agreed to amendments to implement the ‚Äòjournalist information warrant‚Äô scheme. == Overview of the Act == The Act's purpose is to amend the TIA Act and Telecommunications Act 1997 so as to require service providers to retain a defined subset of telecommunications data (the data set) produced in the course of providing telecommunications services. Before the Act, the TIA Act did not specify the types of data the telecommunications industry should retain for law enforcement and national security purposes, or how long that information should be held. As a result, there was significant variation across the telecommunications industry in the types of data available to national law enforcement agencies and national security agencies and the period of time information was available. The lack of available data was identified by agencies as an impediment to their ability to investigate and prosecute national security-related offences, including counter-terrorism, counter-espionage and cyber-security and serious criminal offences such as murder, rape and kidnapping. The amendments are contained in three schedules to the Act: * Schedule 1: Data retention ‚Äì requires telecommunications services providers to retain data associated with a communication for a two-year period. * Schedule 2: Restricting access to stored communications and telecommunications data ‚Äì deals with access to retained data. * Schedule 3: Oversight by the Commonwealth Ombudsman ‚Äì sets out the Ombudsman's role in overseeing compliance with the Act. === Schedule One ===  Division 1 of Part 5-1A: Obligation to keep information or documents  Section 187A requires relevant telecommunications service providers to retain communications data associated with a communication specified in section 187AA for two years. The Revised Explanatory Memorandum (2013-2014-2015) (Memorandum) explains the two-year retention period is necessary so national security and law enforcement agencies have telecommunications data available for investigations. Section 187AA lists in a detailed technologically-neutral table the kinds of information service providers must collect and retain in relation to each relevant service they provide. According to the Memorandum, section 187AA ensures the ‚Äòlegislative framework gives service providers sufficient technical detail about their data retention obligations while remaining flexible enough to adapt to future changes in communication technology‚Äô. Subsection 187AA(2) permits the Attorney-General to amend the data set set out in section 187AA temporarily by issuing a declaration. This is designed to cover a situation where future technologies or changing telecommunications practices require amendments to the data set to ensure the data retention scheme continues to meet its underlying purpose. However, this power is subject to section 187AA(3)(a) which provides that the declaration ceases to be effective 40 sitting days of either House of Parliament after the declaration comes into force.  Information or documents to be retained  {  - ! Item !! Information or documents to be kept !! Explanation -  1  The subscriber of, and accounts, services, telecommunications devices and other relevant services relating to, the relevant service  This includes customer identifying details such as name and address, contact details such as phone numbers and email addresses and acting and payment information. It also includes information relating to any contract, agreement or arrangement relating to the relevant service or account. This allows law enforcement agencies to confirm the subscriber's identity. -  2  The source of the communication  Identifiers for the source of a communication may include: * The phone number, IMSI, IMEI from which a call or SMS was made * Identifying details (such as username, address, number) of the account, service or device from which a text, voice, or multi-media communication was made (e.g., email, VoIP, instant message or video communication) * The IP address and port number allocated to the subscriber or device connected to the internet at the time of the communication; or * Any other service or device identifier known to the provider that uniquely identifies the source of the communication In all instances, the identifiers retained to identify the source of the communication are the ones relevant to, or used in, the operation of the particular service in question. -  3  The destination of a communication  The destination of a communication is the recipient. Identifiers for a communication's destination may include: * The phone number that received a call or SMS * Identifying details (such as username, address or number) of the account, service or device which receives a text, voice or multimedia communication; * The IP address allocated to a subscriber or device connected to the internet at the time of receipt of the communication; and * Any other service or device identifier known to the provider that uniquely identifies the destination of the communication Paragraph 187A(4)(b) puts beyond doubt that service providers are not required to keep information about subscribers' web-browsing history -  4  The date, time and duration of a communication, or of its connection to a relevant service  For phone calls, this is the date and time of the call, which will include the following information: * The start and end of the communication; and * The connection and disconnection to the relevant service. For internet sessions, this is when a device or account connects to a data network, and ends when it disconnected. -  5  The type of a communication and relevant service used in connection with a communication  The 'type' of communication is the form of the communication, including the following: (a) the type of communication: (e.g. voice, SMS, email, chat, forum, social media) (b) the type of the relevant service: (e.g. ADSL, Wi Fi, VoIP, cable, GPRS, VoLTE, LTE) (c) the features of the relevant service that were, or would have been, used by or enabled for the communication (e.g. call waiting, call forwarding, data volume usage) Data volume usage refers to the amount of data uploaded and downloaded by the subscriber. This information can be measured for each session, or in a way applicable to the operation and Acting of the service of question, such as per day or per month. Subsection 187A(5)(b) clarifies that untariffed communications such as 1800 phone calls, communications sent using ‚Äòunlimited‚Äô phone or internet planes, or free internet or application of services, are communications for data retention purposes. -  6  The location of equipment or a line used in connection with a communication  Location records are limited to the location of a device at the start and end of a communication, such as a phone call or an SMS message. This information will include the location of the equipment or line at the start and end of the communication (e.g. cell towers, WiFi hotspots) For services provided to a fixed location such as an ADSL service, this requirement can be met with the retention of the subscriber's address Paragraph 187A (4)(e) of the Act providers that location records are limited to information that is used by a service provider in relation to the relevant service and could include information such as the cell tower, WiFi hotspot or base station a device was connected to at the start and end of communication. }  Information excluded from data retention regime  {  - ! Section !! Details !! Explanation -  Subsection 187A (4)(a) Service providers are not required to keep information/documents that are the contents or substance of a communication. Does not preclude providers from retaining the content or substance of a communication for other lawful purposes, such as their lawful business purposes  This includes: * Words spoken during a phone call * The subject line of an email * Text in an SMS/email Lawful business purposes may include keeping the content of emails on a server as a necessary part of providing an email service. -  Subsection 187A (4)(b)  Service providers are not required to retain information or documents that state an address to which a communication was sent on the internet from a telecommunications device using an internet access service  This refers specifically to ‚Äòinternet browsing history‚Äô and refers to internet address identifiers obtained by a carrier solely as the result of providing an internet access service If the telecommunications service provider obtains a destination internet address identifier as a result of providing another service, for example, an email service ‚Äì it is required to keep a record of that information This provision gives effect to Recommendation 42 of the 2013 PJCIS Report, that internet browsing data should be explicitly excluded from the scope of any data retention scheme -  Subsection 187A (4)(b) and (c) Operates to exclude information of a certain character from retention obligations  This includes information an internet access provider has about destinations of the internet that the provider only has because it provides that service -  Subsection 187A (5)  Attempted and untariffed communications  Examples include: * A phone number is dialed but the phone rings and is unanswered or rings out (subparagraph 187A(5)(a)(i)); * An email server attempts to send a new email to an email client, but the email service does not exist or is not working (subparagraph } If telecommunication providers do not presently create the information or documents required by s 187AA, then section 187A(6) requires providers to use other means to create the information. Furthermore, s 187BA requires a service provider to protect the confidentiality of information it keeps by encrypting it and protecting it from unauthorised interference or access. The section does not prescribe a particular type of encryption. Section 187LA requires service providers to 'take such steps as are reasonable in the circumstances to protect (personal) information from misuse, interference and loss and from unauthorised access, modification and disclosure'. These privacy safeguards are in addition to pre- existing obligations under clause 4.6.3 of the Telecommunications Consumer Protection Code which require service providers to have 'robust procedures to keep its customers' personal information in its possession secure and restrict access to personnel who are authorised by the Supplier'. These obligations can be varied and exempted. Under Division 2 of Part 5-1A, a service provider may seek approval of a data retention implementation plan that replaces a provider's obligations under s 187BA. This may be appropriate where the cost of encrypting a legacy system that was not designed to be encrypted would be unduly onerous and the provider has identified an alternative information security measure that could be employed. While service providers are not prevented from retaining telecommunications data for more than two years for their own lawful purposes, the Act still requires service providers that hold ‚Äòpersonal information‚Äô to take reasonable steps to destroy that information or ensure that information is de-identified where the entity no longer needs the information for a reason set out in the APPs. In other words, when the retention period for the telecommunications data under Part 5-1A of the TIA Act expires, entities may be required to destroy or de-identify such information if it constitutes personal information.  Application of Part 5-1A to telecommunication service providers  Data retention obligations only apply to services that satisfy paragraphs 187A(3)(a), (b) and (c), which includes services for carrying communications, or enabling communications to be carried by guided or unguided electromagnetic energy, or both. Accordingly, data retention obligations apply to relevant services that operate ‚Äòover the top‚Äô (OTP) of, or in conjunction with, other services that carry communications and may, presumably, extend to internet service providers (ISPs) and Australian telecommunication companies such as Telstra, Vodafone and Optus. The Attorney-General is also granted power under section 187A(3A) to declare additional services to be within the data retention regime. Section 187B excludes certain service providers from complying with the data retention obligations, and ensures that entities such as the government, universities and corporations are not required to retain telecommunications data in relation to their own internal networks (provided they are not offered to the public). Similarly, s 187B extends to providers of communication services in a single place, such as free WiFi access in caf√©s and restaurants. The exemption of a service is, however, subject to the discretion of the Communications Access Co-ordinator (CAC), who, pursuant to section 187B(2A), can declare a service provider is nevertheless required to retain telecommunications data. Subsection 187B(3) provides that in making such a declaration, the CAC must have regard to the interests of law enforcement and security, the objects of the Telecommunications Act and the Privacy Act, along with any submissions of the Privacy Commissioner.  Division 2 of Part 5-1A: Data retention implementation plans  Division 2 of Part 5-1A of the TIA Act relates to 'data retention implementation plans', which are plans intended to allow the telecommunications industry to design a pathway to full compliance with the data retention and security obligations within 18 months of the commencement of those obligations. There is a 2-year window for telecommunication service providers and ISPs to implement the changes made by the Act, and over the first 6 months, service providers and ISPs must apply to the Communications Access Co-ordinator (CAC) to obtain approval for their ‚Äòdata retention implementation plan‚Äô. This plan must explain the organisation's current practices, details of the interim arrangements, and the expected date when the organisation will comply with the data retention requirements. Section 187F sets out the factors the CAC must take into account when considering the approval of a submitted plan. These factors include: * Desirability of a service provider achieving substantial compliance with its data retention and security obligations as soon as practicable: s 187F (2)(a) * Whether the proposed plan would reduce the service provider's regulatory burden: s 187(2)(b) * The interests of law enforcement and security: s 187 (2)(d) There is also an extensive consultation process with the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA), under s 187G. Under Division 3 of Part 5-1A, a service provider is able to seek an exemption for some of its services under Division 3 while at the same time submit an implementation plan for some or all of its other services under Division 2. In particular, s 187K provides the CAC with the power to exempt a service provider from data retention and information security obligations. This exemption framework is intended to permit variations in service providers obligations in a range of circumstances, including where imposing data retention obligations would be of limited utility for law enforcement and national security purposes. The decision of the CAC to grant exemption or variations is open to judicial review under s 75(v) of the Constitution and s 39B of the Judiciary Act 1901 (Cth).  Amendments to the ASIO Act and Intelligence Services Act 2001  The Act amends the reporting requirements under s 94(2A) of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979 (ASIO Act) to require that ASIO's annual reports include the following: the number or types of purposes of authorisations to access retained data under s 175 and s 176 (3) of the TIA Act, including ‚Äòjournalist information‚Äô warrants; the length of time for which relevant documents covered by the authorisations were held; and the number of authorisations that related to retained subscriber data and communications traffic data as contained in Item 1, s 187AA Table. The Act also amends the Intelligence Services Act 2001 (ISA), principally to confer a statutory function upon the PJCIS under s 29 of the ISA, enabling it to review the overall effectiveness of the operation of the data retention scheme, with specific focus on the data access activities of ASIO and the Australian Federal Police.  Journalist information warrants  The Act introduces a ‚Äòjournalist information‚Äô warrant scheme under Division 4C. This scheme, requires ASIO and other law enforcement agencies to obtain a warrant prior to authorising the disclosure of telecommunications data for the purposes of identifying a journalist's confidential source. The Attorney-General or an issuing authority (including ‚Äòeligible persons‚Äô within ASIO and AFP) under s 180L and s 180T respectively, must consider several factors when deciding whether to issue an information warrant. In particular, they must be satisfied the warrant is ‚Äòreasonably necessary‚Äô to, enforce the criminal law, locate a person reporting missing to the AFP or State Police, enforce a law that imposes a pecuniary penalty, or protect the public revenue and investigate serious offences against Commonwealth, State or Territory law punishable by a 3-year imprisonment term. Additionally, the Attorney-General or the issuing authority must not issue a warrant unless satisfied the public interest in issuing the warrant outweighs the public interest in protecting the source's confidentiality. Submissions by the newly created Public Interest Advocate must also be considered when deciding to issue a warrant. An enforcement agency may use or disclose the issuing of a warrant or information about such a warrant to a third party only for specified purposes, pursuant to s 182B. Such purposes include enabling a person to comply with their notification obligations under s 185D or s 185E in relation to journalist information warrants, enabling ASIO to perform its functions, or enabling the enforcement of the criminal law or a law imposing a pecuniary penalty, or the protection of the public revenue.  Public Interest Advocate  Section 180X creates the role of Public Interest Advocate, who considers and evaluates journalist information warrants made by ASIO and law enforcement agencies pursuant to s 180L and s 180T respectively. The Advocate can make independent submissions to the Minister, and to the issuing authority in the case of the law enforcement agencies, regarding the granting of a journalist information warrant. === Schedule Two === Schedule 2 amends the TIA Act to limit the types of agencies that can apply for stored communications warrants under Part 3-3 of Chapter 3 of the TIA Act, and the types of authorities and bodies that can authorise the disclosure of telecommunications data under Division 4, Part 4-1 of Chapter 4 of the TIA Act. Prior to the Act, the TIA Act permitted ‚Äòenforcement agencies‚Äô to access both stored communications (such as content of emails or SMS messages) and data about communications (metadata). The former required a warrant for access under s 110 and s 116, but the latter did not. ‚ÄòEnforcement agencies‚Äô were broadly defined to include all interception agencies, as well as a body whose function includes administering a law imposing a pecuniary penalty or the protection of public revenue. As a result, the range of agencies that had access to stored communications and telecommunications data was wide and included local government, councils and Commonwealth and State departments and agencies. Schedule 2 creates only two categories of authorised agencies: ‚Äòcriminal law enforcement agencies‚Äô and ‚Äòenforcement agencies‚Äô (which incorporate the former).  Criminal law enforcement agencies  The Act removes reference to an ‚Äòenforcement agency‚Äô in subsection 110(1) of the TIA Act and substitutes the new definition of a ‚Äòcriminal law enforcement agency‚Äô in s 110A of the Act. According to the Memorandum, the definition reduces the number of agencies that can apply for stored communication warrants from all enforcement agencies that investigate serious contraventions to only those authorities and bodies recognised under section 110A of the Act as being a ‚Äòcriminal law enforcement agency‚Äô. Under section 110A, ‚Äòcriminal law enforcement agency‚Äô is defined as including the Australian Federal Police, a State Police force, the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity, Australian Crime Commission, Australia Customs and Border Protection Service, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the Crime Commission, the Police Integrity Commission, the Crime and Corruption Commission of Queensland, the Corruption and Crime Commission and the Independent Commissioner Against Corruption. Section 110A(3) enables the Attorney-General to declare, upon request, other authorities or bodies to be ‚Äòcriminal law enforcement agencies'. In making such a declaration, the Attorney-General must consider a range of factors, including whether the authority is involved in ‚Äòinvestigating serious contraventions‚Äô. Section 110A(8) enables the Attorney- General to later revoke such a declaration if no longer satisfied that circumstances justify the declaration.  Enforcement agencies  Section 176A alters the definition of ‚Äòenforcement agency‚Äô in subsection 5(1) of the TIA Act to limit the authorities and bodies that can access telecommunications data (metadata) to only 'criminal law enforcement agencies' and authorities and bodies declared under s 176A to be an ‚Äòenforcement agency‚Äô. In declaring an authority or body an 'enforcement agency', the Attorney-General must consider a range of factors, including whether the agency enforces the criminal law, imposes pecuniary penalties, or protects the public revenue. Section 176A(3B) requires that the Attorney-General not declare a body an ‚Äòenforcement agency‚Äô unless satisfied on ‚Äòreasonable‚Äô grounds that the body has these aforementioned functions. The Attorney-General may later revoke such a declaration under s 176A(8) if no longer satisfied that circumstances justify the declaration. According to the Memorandum, this section ensures only bodies or authorities with a demonstrated need for access to telecommunications data can authorise service providers to disclose information. === Schedule Three === Schedule 3 inserts obligations into the TIA Act to keep records about access to stored communications and telecommunications data, and also inserts into the TIA Act a comprehensive record-keeping, inspection and oversight regime in relation to: * The issue of preservation notices by criminal law enforcement agencies; and * Access to, and dealing with, stored communications by criminal law enforcement agencies, and telecommunications data by criminal law enforcement agencies and enforcement agencies. The record-keeping regime requires all Commonwealth, State and Territory enforcement agencies to keep prescribed information and documents necessary to demonstrate they have exercised their powers in accordance with their obligations under the TIA Act. The inspection and oversight regime requires the Ombudsman to inspect and oversee records of Commonwealth, State and Territory agencies in order to assess compliance with their duties under the TIA Act.  Record-keeping obligations  Section 186A sets out the information or documents an enforcement agency must retain to ensure the Ombudsman is able to inspect the agency's records to determine the agency's compliance with Chapter 4 of the TIA Act. The types of documents or information required to be kept in the agency's records include the authorisations made by an officer of the agency under sections 178, 178A, 179 or 180, and documents or materials that indicate whether the authorisation was made properly. Subsection 186A(2) allows the Attorney-General to prescribe additional kinds of documents and other materials enforcement agencies must keep.  Oversight by Ombudsman  Section 186B requires the Ombudsman to inspect records kept by enforcement agencies using or accessing telecommunications data and stored communications. The Ombudsman must determine whether an agency is compliant with its obligations regarding the issue of preservation notices, access to stored communications, and access to telecommunications data. Section 186J requires the Ombudsman to report publicly on the results of its oversight functions under section 186B. This ensures the Ombudsman can make public the results of its inspections under Chapter 4A. == Compatibility with human rights == In accordance with its obligations under the Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) Act 2011 the Australian Government is required to provide statements of compatibility of all new bills with Australia's human rights obligations under international instruments, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). The Revised Explanatory Memorandum (2013-2014-2015) (Memorandum) provided a detailed exposition of the Act and its engagement with human rights and an analysis of the Act's compatibility with the ICCPR. The Memorandum claims the Act is compatible with human rights and freedoms recognised and declared in the international instruments listed in section 3 of the Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) Act 2011. In particular, the Act engages the ICCPR in these ways: * Protection against arbitrary or unlawful interference with privacy contained in Article 17 of the International (Article 17, ICCPR) * The right to a fair hearing, the right to minimum guarantees in criminal proceedings and the presumption of innocence (Article 14, ICCPR) * The right to freedom of expression (Article 19, ICCPR) * The right to life and the right to security of the person (Articles 6 and 9, ICCPR) * The right to an effective remedy (Article 2(3), ICCPR) === Right to privacy (Article 17, ICCPR) === Article 17 of the ICCPR provides that no one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with their privacy, family, home or correspondence. The use of the term ‚Äòarbitrary‚Äô means any interference with privacy must be in accordance with the provision, aims and objectives of the ICCPR and should be reasonable in the circumstances. The United Nations Human Rights Committee has interpreted this provision as requiring that any limitation of privacy must be both proportionate to a legitimate end and necessary in the circumstances of a particular case.  Schedule 1  According to the Memorandum, the legislative requirement for providers to store telecommunications data in relation to its services is consistent with Article 17. The specification of the types of data that may be retained (under s 187AA) ensures that only narrow categories of telecommunications data necessary for the investigation of serious criminal offences and national security threats are retained. The Memorandum claims that this means the retention of specified dataset under s 187AA, while an interference with privacy, is reasonable and is proportionate to and necessary for the legitimate aim of ensuring law enforcement and intelligence agencies have the investigative tools to safeguard national security and prevent or detect serious and organised crime. Each Item (1-6) in s 187AA specifying particular types of data that can be retained was then assessed for its compatibility with Article 17 of the ICCPR, and each Item was considered reasonable, proportionate and necessary to criminal and national security investigations. CAC exemption regime Similarly, the exemption framework established by s 187B along with the introduction of the CAC indirectly strengthens the right to privacy of individual customers by providing a method of reducing data retention obligations in circumstances where the volume of data to be retained is disproportionate to the interest of law enforcement and national security. Security and destruction of retained data According to the Memorandum, the Act contains safeguards to ensure individuals' privacy rights, especially in relation to telecommunications, are protected. In particular, the Act provides that the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) in the Privacy Act 1988 apply to all data retained under the Act. Specifically, the APPs impose an obligation on service providers to ensure the quality and/or correctness of any personal information (APP 10) and to keep personal information secure (APP 11). This introduces an oversight mechanism whereby the Privacy Commissioner can review and assess service providers' collection, storage and use of data. An additional layer of privacy and security protection for consumer data provided by the Act is the requirement that service providers protect retained data through encryption and introduce the Telecommunications Sector Security Reforms, which require service providers to do their best to prevent unauthorised access and interference. These safeguards are supplemented by already-existing obligations under the Telecommunications Consumer Protection Code. Comparative frameworks ‚Äì EU data retention directive In 2014, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) assessed the legality of the EU's Data Retention Directive in two seminal decisions, namely, Digital Rights Ireland Ltd and Ors(C-293/12) and Karntner Landesregierung and Ors (C-594/12). In these cases, the CJEU enunciated criteria that a data retention regime must meet in order to be compatible with human rights principles. It also stated that proposed legislation ‚Äòmust lay down clear and precise rules governing the scope and application of the measures in question, imposing minimum safeguards so that the persons about whom data have been retained have sufficient guarantees to effectively protect their personal data against risk of abuse and unlawful access and use of that data‚Äô. The CJEU considered that the extent of interference proposed by the EU Data Retention Directive was disproportionate to the objective being achieved, and more broadly, was not compatible with applicable human rights instruments. The Memorandum states that the Act is consistent with the criteria established by the CJEU.  Schedule 2  The collective amendments in Schedule 2 reinforce the privacy protections established under Schedule 1. According to the Memorandum, the amendments regarding the limitation of agencies that can apply for access to stored communications warrants, and the types of authorities and bodies that can authorise the disclosure of telecommunications data under Division 4 of the TIA Act, contribute to ensuring that access is reasonable, proportionate and necessary. The Memorandum claims that the amendment of the definition of ‚Äòenforcement agency‚Äô to clearly circumscribe the agencies who may access telecommunications data effectively ensures access is limited to those agencies that have a clear and scrutinised need for access to telecommunications data in the performance of their functions. Furthermore, in order to reinforce the privacy protections associated with a user's telecommunications data contained within the TIA Act, Schedule 2 introduces limitations upon the types of agencies permitted to authorise the disclosure of telecommunications data for an agency's investigation. In this respect, the Act increases the threshold requirement in s 180F, by requiring that the authorising officer be ‚Äòsatisfied on reasonable grounds‚Äô that a particular disclosure or use of telecommunication data is proportionate to the intrusion into privacy it represents. According to the Memorandum, this amendment bolsters privacy safeguards by ensuring agencies weigh the proportionality of the intrusion into privacy against the value of the evidence and the assistance to be provided to the investigation. Agencies such as ASIO are also subject to strict privacy and proportionality obligations under the Attorney- General's Guidelines, made under s 8(1)(a) of the ASIO Act, which requires, inter alia, that the means used for obtaining the information must be proportionate to the gravity of the threat posed and investigations and inquiries into individuals and groups should be undertaken with as little intrusion into personal privacy as possible. These amendments ensure any abrogation of the privacy right in Article 17 is limited to the legitimate purpose articulated in the TIA Act.  Schedule 3  The oversight provisions contained in Schedule 3 extend the remit of the Ombudsman to comprehensively assess agency compliance with all the enforcement agency's obligations under Chapter 3 and 4 of the TIA Act, including the use and access to telecommunications data. According to the Memorandum, this oversight model promotes the right to privacy by confirming the Ombudsman's ability to audit an agency's use of its powers to access stored communications and telecommunications data under the TIA Act. This helps ensure an agency's access to the telecommunications information of interest to an investigation, and the interaction with the privacy right under Article 17 in that regard is a reasonable, necessary and proportionate limitation on that right to privacy. Furthermore, a comprehensive oversight model ensures that use, access to or disclosure of telecommunications data is subject to independent compliance assessment. It also provides an important level of public accountability and scrutiny of agency practice by virtue of the Ombudsman's public reporting regime implemented in Chapter 4A. According to the Memorandum, the oversight model promotes the Convention rights by virtue of several key features of the regime, including a higher level of specificity and transparency in terms of the precise reporting obligations imposed on law enforcement agencies, consistency in inspection methodology by virtue of non-fragmentary model involving oversight of all agencies that apply the powers under Chapters 3 and 4, and clearly defining reporting obligations, which engender a higher level of compliance by agencies and greater acuity in statistical output to measure compliance for annual reporting and cross-agency compliance. === Right to freedom of expression (Article 19, ICCPR) === Article 19 of the ICCPR provides that all persons shall have the right to freedom of expression. This right includes the freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds through any media. Article 19(3) provides that freedom of expression may be subject to limitations for specified purposes provided in the right, including the protection of national security or public order where such restrictions are provided by law and are necessary for attaining one of these purposes. According to the Memorandum, the Act could potentially restrict the right to freedom of expression, as some persons may be more reluctant to use telecommunications services to seek, receive and impart information if they know data about their communication is stored and may be subject to lawful access. However, the limitation imposed by the data retention regime is in pursuit of the legitimate objective of protecting public order and further limits the abrogation of the right to freedom of expression by ensuring that only the minimum necessary types and amounts of telecommunications data are retained, and by limiting the range of agencies that may access the data. Journalist information warrant regime According to the Memorandum, the Bill promotes freedom of expression and the right to privacy by requiring a higher threshold for access through ex ante judicial review of a warrant for data authorisation requests and ensuring data access for the purposes of identifying a source receives specific and dedicated independent attention. Independent oversight minimises the risk that sources will be deterred from informing the press of matters of public interest, and ensures the media is not adversely affected by the measures. Furthermore, this measure ensures access is only permitted in circumstances where the public interest in issuing the warrant outweighs the public interest in maintaining the confidentiality of the source. The additional protection afforded to these data authorisations complements journalists‚Äô limited privilege not to be compelled to identify their sources where they have given an undertaking of confidentiality. The amendments add a further warrant threshold, providing a significant additional and unique protection in relation to the identification of confidential journalist sources. Additionally, the statutory criteria to which issuing authorities must have regard in considering a journalist information warrant application, including the gravity of conduct in relation to which the warrant is sought and the potential investigative utility of the information, ensures privacy and public interest considerations are always taken into account before a warrant is granted. === Right to life and security of person (Articles 6 and 9, ICCPR) === Pursuant to Article 9 of the ICCPR, the state is to provide reasonable and appropriate measures within the scope of those available to public authorities to protect a person's physical security. Similarly, the right to life under Article 6 of the ICCPR imposes a positive obligation to protect life. The Memorandum points out that European jurisprudence has established that the obligation to protect life also requires the police and other protective authorities to take, in certain well- defined circumstances, preventative operational measures to protect an individual whose life is at risk from the acts of a third party. The obligation the Act places on service providers to retain a limited subset of telecommunications data buttresses the right to life in Article 6 of the ICCPR. According to the Memorandum, if such data is not retained, law enforcement investigations will be compromised and the police's ability to protect the security of potential victims of crime is critically undermined. == Case for data retention  Modernisation === Prior to the Act's introduction, access to telecommunications data in Australia was governed by the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979 (the TIA Act) and the Telecommunications Act 1997. Since they were enacted, communication technologies have undergone a transformation. Online communication is an integral part of life. Australians now use a variety of devices to communicate, including fixed line telephones, mobile phones, personal computers and tablets. Australians also use various communication applications including email, instant messaging and social media platforms. Telecommunications service providers have responded to the increasing use of these devices and applications with new business practices, selling their services to customers on the basis of monthly data volumes. Consequently, they no longer need to store information surrounding individual communications to accurately bill customers. Some providers only retain the details of the amount of data sent for their billing purposes. Prior to the Act, the retention period for IP-based data is volatile; data is typically stored for only a number of weeks or months. As technology evolves, all historical telecommunications data will be based on internet protocols as providers of telephony services increasingly use IP based technologies. In its 2013 report on its inquiry into Australia's national security laws, the PJCIS concluded that the increasing adoption of these practices and the failure to retain data had \\"resulted in an actual degradation in the investigative capabilities of national security agencies, a process that is likely to accelerate in the future.\\" Telecommunications data is critical to many criminal investigations. Telecommunications data accessed during the initial stage of an inquiry assists law enforcement officials to understand the lives of victims, identify potential perpetrators, and construct pictures of their networks. Access to telecommunications also enables law enforcement agencies to collect and assess critical information and other evidence that could not otherwise be acquired. Furthermore, access to telecommunications data is in some instances the only way in which some types of crime can be understood, and perpetrators identified and punished. Cyber-crime is such a category. Cyber-crimes necessarily leave a limited physical footprint. Sifting through telecommunications data is the only way investigators can identify real world offenders. The inability of police and other law enforcement agencies to access telecommunications data can hamper criminal investigations. In their submission to the PJCIS inquiry into the Bill, the South Australian Police described such one such instance: \\"A stalled murder investigation was reviewed about 14 months after the victim‚Äôs death. Fresh information received during the review identified a suspect who was a known drug dealer. The victim, a regular drug user, had been in contact with the suspect and investigators suspect the victim may have been killed over a drug deal. Historical telecommunications data was sought for the suspect‚Äôs mobile service for around the time of the murder but it was no longer available. The unavailability of the telecommunications data has been detrimental to the investigation and the case remains unsolved.\\" Supporters of the Act argue it ensures the continued availability of telecommunications data to prevent and solve crime. === High- risk environment === The current ongoing perceived threat of terrorism in Australia is advanced as a reason why a mandatory data retention regime is needed. In September 2014, on ASIO's advice, the Australian government raised the National Terrorism Public Alert level from medium to high. ASIO dispensed its recommendation on a number of factors including the increasing number of Australians working with or inspired by the acts of a number of different terrorist organizations including the Islamic State, Jabhat-al-Nusrah and Al- Qai‚Äôda. Moreover, in its 2014 submission to the PGCIS inquiry into the Bill, ASIO noted that cyber attacks by hostile powers launched in order to obtain privileged political, military, economic, trade, business and government information pose a threat to computer systems operated by both the state and business. The Attorney General's Department has argued that in such a high- risk environment, a data retention regime is imperative. \\"In an increased threat environment characterised by a higher operational tempo, there is a narrower margin for error in law enforcement and national security investigations. The narrower margin is particularly evident in relation to lone wolf threats: such persons have limited, if any, contact with other known extremists, giving authorities fewer opportunities to detect their activities and intentions. As such, any missed opportunity to identify and prevent these attacks represents a significant risk.\\" In its submission the Department also noted the non-retention of telecommunications data can lead to opportunities to combat crime being missed: \\"In the best case, agencies may be able to progress investigations by using more resource intensive methods, limiting their capacity to investigate other matters, or more intrusive investigative techniques. In the worst case, crime or threat to security will not be adequately investigated.\\" == Case against data retention == Submissions made by key privacy, human rights and legal bodies, including the Australian Human Rights Commission (AHRC), Australian Lawyers for Human Rights (ALHR), Australian Privacy Foundation (APF), Law Council of Australia (LCA), Councils of Civil Liberties across Australia (CCLS) and the NSW and Victorian Privacy Commissioner, to the PJCIS were highly critical of the mandatory data retention scheme. The following headings represent the main arguments and criticisms made in several key submissions to the PJCIS. === Breaches human rights === The ‚Äòstatement of compatibility‚Äô contained in the Revised Explanatory Memorandum claimed the regime did not breach Australia's human rights obligations under the ICCPR. However several submissions made to the PJCIS questioned the Bill's compatibility with several human rights principles. In its 2014 submission, the Australian Privacy Foundation argued the Bill was incompatible with fundamental human rights and freedoms, especially the right to privacy. It pointed to a considerable body of legal opinion that has concluded that laws mandating blanket retention of metadata breach international human rights law. It submitted that the Bill breached fundamental rights to privacy because it was neither necessary for nor proportionate to legitimate national security and law enforcements objectives. According to the APF, blanket data retention regimes are disproportionate because they ‚Äòindiscriminately mandate the retention of data relating to entire populations, irrespective of the nature of the data or of whether or not there is a reasonable suspicions of a serious threat posed by those to whom the data relates‚Äô. The APF referred to several key international law decisions, including reports of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and Human Rights Council, which all found metadata retention regimes breached human rights, especially the right to privacy. A similar position was taken by the Law Institute of Victoria (LIV), which submitted that, quoting the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, ‚Äòeven the mere possibility of communications information being captured creates an interference with privacy, with a potential chilling effect on rights, including those to free expression and association‚Äô. As a result, the LIV submitted that mandatory third party data retention regimes are neither necessary nor proportionate, irrespective of increased concerns regarding national security threats. Australian Lawyers for Human Rights (ALHR) also submitted concerns that the Bill constituted a serious and unreasonable infringement of the rights of law-abiding Australians. According to the ALHR, the Bill was an ‚Äòindiscriminate, society wide‚Äô invasion of privacy, which rebutted the presumption of innocence. Additionally, the ALHR contended the Bill infringes other human rights not acknowledged in the Memorandum, in particular, the right to be treated with dignity (Article 1, Universal Declaration of Human Rights), freedom from arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home or correspondence (Article 12, Universal Declaration of Human Rights). The ALHR also submitted the Bill was likely to chill freedom of association (Articles 21 and 22, ICCPR and Article 20, Universal Declaration of Human Rights), the right to free development of one's personality (Article 22, Universal Declaration of Human Rights), the right to take part in the conduct of public affairs (Article 25, ICCPR), and press freedoms. According to ALHR, the Bill would restrict free speech, as Australians would not know what information about them, including information about their contacts, might be shared among government (and non- government) bodies. Similarly, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights argued that, although the data retention regime pursues a legitimate objective, the scheme's proportionality is questionable and it may have a ‚Äòchilling‚Äô effect on people's freedom and willingness to communicate via telecommunications services because people will ‚Äòself-censor‚Äô views expressed via telecommunications services. This view is also supported by the Law Council of Australia (LCA) and the Councils for Civil Liberties Australia (CCLA) . === Problems with definition of the data set === A major concern emphasised in several submissions was that the Bill did not define the relevant data set, leaving the precise definition to be prescribed by regulations. The government's justification for this is that this approach is consistent with the technology-neutral approach of the Privacy Act 1988 and Part 13 of the TIA Act. However, the APF considered that the way in which the data set is defined in the Bill was deeply problematic for several reasons, including that the data set is not appropriately limited to that which is necessary and proportionate for law enforcement and national security. The APF proposed that the Government consider adopting a more circumscribed and targeted data preservation regime that ‚Äòincorporates adequate thresholds and procedural safeguards to ensure the data are sufficiently relevant to specific investigations‚Äô. Similarly, the APF submitted that the scope of data which may be lawfully accessed needed to be appropriately defined under Chapter 4. Furthermore, it claimed there were serious problems with the way the Bill dealt with browsing history, including in s 187A(4)(b). In particular, there is no prohibition on service providers collecting and retaining Internet browsing history, which must be accessed as data under Chapter 4, meaning that the government's claim that browsing history was excluded from the data set is disingenuous. Australian Lawyers for Human Rights (ALHR) also submitted that the lack of certainty regarding the prescribed data set was bad legislative practice and likely to result in legislative ‚Äòcreep‚Äô, with individuals' privacy rights being increasingly attacked through expansion of the data set. Furthermore, the Law Council of Australia (LCA) recommended that the power to prescribe by way of regulation the mandatory data set should be removed from the Bill and the Bill should clearly define the types of telecommunications data and the specific data set to be retained. The 2015 PJCIS Report took into consideration these concerns and recommended the Bill be redrafted to prescribe the data set in the primary legislation. When the Bill was amended in 2015, the data to be retained was detailed within the primary legislation, under s 187AA, and this was the form in which the Bill became law. === Distinction between content and metadata === A persistent argument made against the Act was the false distinction it draws between content and ‚Äòmetadata‚Äô. In its 2014 submission, the Council for Civil Liberties across Australia and the APF claimed that whilst the explicit exclusion of ‚Äòcontent‚Äô from the categories of prescribed data is welcome, the purported distinction between ‚Äòcontent‚Äô and ‚Äòmetadata‚Äô overlooks how much ‚Äòmetadata' can reveal about a person, especially when combined with contemporary data analytics. The APF, quoting the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union in Digital Rights Ireland, stated that metadata, ‚Äòtaken as a whole may allow very precise conclusions to be drawn concerning the private lives of the persons who data has been retained‚Äô. Similarly, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights pointed out that ‚Äòthe aggregation of information commonly referred to as ‚Äòmetadata‚Äô, may give an insight into an individual's behaviour, social relationships, private preference and identity that go beyond even that conveyed by access the context of a private communication‚Äô. The APF also referred to a statement by Steward Baker, the former general counsel of the NSA, who claimed that ‚ÄòMetadata absolutely tells you everything about somebody‚Äôs life. If you have enough metadata, you don‚Äôt really need content‚Äô. As a result, the APF considered the claim by the Government that telecommunications data is less intrusive than communications content to be misleading and recommended that legal safeguards on the collection of and access to telecommunications data should at least be as strong as those applying to communications content. The Law Council of Australia (LCA) was also concerned that there was uncertainty about whether some types of telecommunications data would be considered ‚Äòcontent‚Äô (and thus excluded from collection), including whether meta-tags would be captured. Further, while the Memorandum to the Bill recognised that ‚Äòtext messages and e-mails stored on a phone or other communications device are more akin to content than data‚Äô, the LCA claims it did not adequately explain how this is so. The LCA also argued that despite the exclusion of content from the prescribed data set, the categories of telecommunications data that may be prescribed are nonetheless broadly defined and may provide information about crucial matters such as people's associations and their whereabouts. Rxamples of personal information that it said could be determined from the prescribed data set included medical connections, use of mental health services, use of suicide hotlines, use of domestic violence crisis support, use of child abuse support, family associations, friendship groups, financial connections, legal connections, religious associations, political affiliations, sexual association, commercial preferences, location and movement. The LCA and the LIV also criticised s 187A(6), which introduces the requirement that telecommunication service providers create data not currently captured through their services. In particular, the LCA was concerned that it was unclear in the Memorandum and Bill how the content and substance of communications would be separated and filtered from the non-content by service providers in the course of meeting their data retention obligations. === Duration of data retention obligation === Another major criticism of the data retention regime was the two-year data retention period specified in s 187C. The CCLS urged the government to reduce the data retention period because it is high compared to mass data retention regimes in other jurisdictions. The CCLS submitted statistics showing that most data accessed for investigations of terrorism and complex criminal offences is accessed within 6 months of being captured and that following this period the percentage of data used decreases significantly. The Communications Alliance and AMTA also noted that the majority of requests made by agencies to access telecommunications data held by ISPs related to data less than 6 months old. Similarly, the APF was concerned that the retention period was excessive and disproportionate, and that it imposed disproportionate costs on carriers and ISPs. The APF recommended a retention period of 1 year be trialed for the first 3 years of the scheme's operation. The Australian Human Rights Commission (AHRC) drew attention to the Evaluation Report on the EU Data Retention Direction in 2011, which considered that the shortening of mandatory retention would improve the proportionality of the scheme. The Report also found that 67% of accessed data was under 3 months old and only 2% of requested data was over 1 year old across the EU. The AHRC also pointed to the decision of the CJEU in Digital Rights Ireland, in which a retention period of no less than 6 months and up to 2 years was assessed. The CJEU held that the data retention period was arbitrary and not limited to what was 'reasonably necessary' to achieve the objective pursued. Accordingly, the AHRC considered the 2 year retention period as unreasonable and disproportionate. The LCA also considered the two-year period as unusually long by international standards and not satisfactorily justified. Despite such widespread concern and statistical evidence, the two-year retention period became law. === Security of retained data === The security of retained data was also a point of contention. The LCA voiced concerns that there did not appear to be a minimum set of standards for government agencies and service providers to ensure security of retained telecommunications data. It drew attention to the recent experience of the Australian Federal Police (AFP), which mistakenly published sensitive information, including telecommunications data, connected to criminal investigations, demonstrating the importance of high levels of data security. It submitted that the implementation plan process would encourage service providers to seek the lowest possible cost solutions to data security. It referred to the CJEU's invalidation of the EU Data Directive on the basis it permitted providers to have regard to economic considerations when determining the level of security which they applied. Both the LCA and the ALHR submissions expressed concern about s 187C(3), which allows a service provider to keep information or a document for a period longer than the two- year data retention period. Furthermore, once data is accessed by a law enforcement agency, there is no obligation upon it to destroy it in a timely manner even when it is irrelevant to the agency or no longer needed. The LCA made two recommendations - first, that the views of the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner should be obtained to determine whether the current APPs and the proposed Telecommunications Service Sector Security Reform (TSSR) relating to the destruction of telecommunications data by service providers is sufficient to safeguard personal information, and, second, that the Bill should be amended to require law enforcement and security agencies to de-identify or put beyond use in a timely manner, data containing ‚Äòpersonal‚Äô information which is no longer relevant or needed for the agencies purposes. === Access to stored communications === Many submissions welcomed the circumscription of agencies that can access stored communications data under Schedule 2. The LCA, however, argued these amendments allowed the Government to expand the list of agencies that can access retained data without parliamentary scrutiny and that this was an example of another inappropriate delegation of power in the Bill. Further, the LCA, CCLS and APF all submitted that the Bill left open the critical question of what authorities or bodies would be listed as an ‚Äòenforcement agency‚Äô, and therefore be able to access data. As the CCLS pointed out, the issue of who will have access to stored telecommunications data is of great significance in determining the proportionality of this intrusion into individuals' privacy rights. The APF submitted that the Attorney-General was given too much discretion to declare bodies or authorities as criminal law enforcement agencies and while the Bill provides that the Attorney-General must consider a range of factors, this is an ineffective limitation on the Attorney-General's discretion and could potentially mean the definition could be extended to bodies administering laws imposing pecuniary penalties or revenue laws. In its submission, the LIV considered these functions as incredibly broad and a reflection of the pre-existing and problematic situation under the TIA Act, where an unknown number of diverse federal, state and even local government entities can access telecommunications data. The thresholds for access were also a central feature of several submissions. As discussed above, once the Attorney-General declares an agency an enforcement agency, that agency is able to access metadata retained by a service providers. The agency can do so by requesting and authorising service providers to disclose the information. Such authorisations can be made in relation to retrospective historical data where doing so is ‚Äòreasonably necessary‚Äô for the enforcement of the criminal law, a law imposing a pecuniary penalty, or a law protecting the public revenue. In relation to prospective data, such authorisations could be made where ‚Äòreasonably necessary‚Äô for the investigation of a serious criminal offence. This differs from the process relating to stored communications (content), which can only be accessed by criminal law enforcement agencies through a warrant process. The CCLS, LCA and the APF all submitted that both thresholds for access were too low, for several reasons. First, ‚Äòreasonably necessary‚Äô was not defined in the Bill and according to the CCLS, this could be interpreted in several ways and would be better altered to simply use the word ‚Äònecessary‚Äô. The APF recommended a higher threshold be applied to access of both real-time communications and stored content, and that it be required that such access relate to investigations of serious criminal offences, punishable by an imprisonment term of at least 7 years. Additionally, the APF submitted that the procedural safeguards for access to data under Chapter 4 of the TIA Act were inadequate. It recommended that safeguards be introduced to regulate access to non-content telecommunications data, which could involve a decision of an independent body required to balance the objectives of access against the intrusion of privacy. The CCLS also argued that it is clearly unacceptable for ‚Äòenforcement agencies‚Äô to be their own authorisers of access to personal information. Accordingly, it submitted that access to both retrospective and prospective data under the proposed scheme should only be on the basis of a prior warrant authorisation from a judicial authority. The LIV also submitted that access to telecommunications data must require judicial oversight. Gilbert + Tobin, in their 2014 submission, were also concerned regarding the prospect that enforcement agencies will effectively be able to access metadata on a ‚Äòself-serve‚Äô basis and given that metadata can reveal a significant amount of personal information about an individual, believed that greater procedural protections for accessing metadata should apply, and could be achieved through a warrant process along the lines of that allowing access to stored communications. === Blanket data retention not essential nor effective === In its submission, the CCLS did not accept that the data retention regime should extend to compulsory collection and retention of mass metadata of virtually the whole population. The primary reason for this is the scepticism of many experts, parliamentarians and legal and civil society groups that ‚Äòmass collection and retention of telecommunications data of non-suspect citizens for retrospective access will significantly increase Australia‚Äôs (or any nations) safety from terrorism or serious crime‚Äô. They pointed to the then-recent tragedies in Sydney and Paris, which generated comment around the fact the perpetrators were already well known to police and intelligence agencies, but had been allowed to drop from active intelligence. Furthermore, the APF and CCLS drew attention to a 2014 report on US data retention programmes of the United States Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCOB), an independent agency established to advise the US executive on anti- terrorism law, The PCOB stated: \\"We are aware of no instance in which the program directly contributed to the discovery of a previously unknown terrorist plot or the disruption of a terrorist attack ‚Ä¶ we believe that only one instance over the past seven years has the program arguably contributed to the identification of an unknown terrorist suspect\\" The APF drew attention to the US Klayman v Obama (2013) decision where Judge Leon concluded there was no single instance where the collection of mass metadata either stopped an imminent terrorist threat or otherwise assisted in achieving a time-sensitive objective, and that there were therefore ‚Äòserious doubts as to the efficacy of the metadata collection program‚Äô. As a result of criticism of the NSA program, the US Freedom Act was introduced in 2013 in order to end mass metadata collection. In support of the Bill, Representative Sensenbrenner and Democrat Patrick Leahy stated that ‚Äòit is simply not accurate to say that the bulk of collection of phone records has prevented dozens of terrorists‚Äô plots‚Äô and that their position was bi-partisan. The Law Council of Australia submitted that the ability to access telecommunications data under the Bill was not limited to national security or serious crime, as it said it should be, and also submitted that there is little evidence from comparable jurisdictions with mandatory data retention schemes to suggest they actually assist in reducing crime. For example, in Germany, research indicates the retention scheme led to an increase in the number of convictions by only 0.006%. Furthermore, there is a lack of Australian statistical quantitative and qualitative data to indicate the necessity of telecommunications data in securing convictions. The LCA suggested that if the proposed scheme was introduced, statistical reporting should indicate the times when access to retained data has resulted in a conviction, whether it has assisted in detecting serious criminal activity or assisted security agencies against threats to Australia's national security. The CCLS and the APF concluded that the available evidenced-based research suggested a high degree of uncertainty as to the effectiveness and legitimacy of mass data retention regimes in preventing terrorism and other serious crime. ===Journalists and their sources === Journalists and media organisations have long expressed concern over the introduction of a data retention scheme. This criticism, however, reached its peak in March 2015, after the Government agreed to accept amendments to the Bill outlined in a report by the JPCIS. On 9 March, the chair of the Australian Press Council, Professor David Weisbort said that if the Bill was passed into law as it stood the field of journalism would be adversely affected as whistleblowers would no longer be willing to come forward. Alarmed by growing criticism from the media, and committed to passing the Bill before the scheduled Easter recess of both Houses of Parliament, the Government assembled a team of high-ranking public servants including national security adviser, Andrew Shearer and Australian Federal Police Commissioner, Andrew Colvin, to meet with executives from News Corporation, Fairfax, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) and representatives from the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance (MEAA) to discuss their concerns. On 16 March 2015, Opposition Leader Bill Shorten revealed he had written to Prime Minister Tony Abbott expressing the Labor Party's concerns about the Bill's effect on the freedom of the press and journalists' ability to protect their sources, and stating that if the Government did not change the Bill to protect journalistic sources, the Labor Party would move to amend the Bill in the Senate. Following negotiations with the Labor Party, the Government agreed to amend the Bill and introduce a warrant system. Law enforcement and other agencies seeking to view the metadata of journalists can only do so where a judicial officer or a legal member of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal has issued a warrant. This warrant can only be granted after arguments from both the agency seeking the metadata and a public interest advocate are heard. The warrant system has been heavily criticised. Critics highlight the fact the public interest advocate, appointed by the Government, cannot contact the journalist whose metadata would be the subject of the warrant and cannot receive instructions from that journalist. Moreover, anyone who discloses information about a journalist information warrant and whether one has been applied for, granted, or not granted, can be punished with two years imprisonment. Dr Adam Henschke, an academic working at the Australian National University, has argued that in the world of Wikileaks, whistleblowers may not wish to risk detection by working with journalists, and may simply choose to make a \\"wholesale dump\\" of information on the internet. === Cost === The Attorney General's Department commissioned consulting firm Price Waterhouse Coopers (PWC) to provide high level costs for the initial implementation of the data retention scheme. PWC provided that report on 11 December 2014. In its final report, the PJCIS revealed that PWC had calculated the upfront capital costs of implementing data retention to be between approximately $188.8 million and $319.1 million. After receiving submissions and hearing evidence on the issue of the cost from a number of stakeholders, including telecommunications providers Optus and Vodafone, and the Australian Communications Consumer Action Network (ACCAN) the Committee made a number of recommendations: \\"The Committee recommends that the Government make a substantial contribution to the upfront capital costs of service providers implementing their data retention obligations.\\" \\"When designing the funding arrangements to give effect to this recommendation, the Government should ensure that an appropriate balance is achieved that accounts for the significant variations between the services, business models, sizes and financial positions of different companies within the telecommunications industry.\\" \\"That the model for funding service providers provides sufficient support for smaller service providers, who may not have sufficient capital budgets or operating cash flow to implement data retention, and privacy and security controls; without upfront assistance; incentives timely compliance with their data retention obligations; and does not result in service providers receiving windfall payments to operate and maintain existing legacy systems.\\" On 12 May 2015 Federal Treasurer Joe Hockey announced the Government would commit $131 million to assist telecommunications service providers with the cost of the scheme. This amount has drawn criticism from some in the telecommunications community. Laurie Patton, Chief Executive Officer of the Internet Society said this amount is simply not enough and costs will be passed onto consumers in the form of higher internet fees. \\"The Government‚Äôs original cost estimate was not based on widespread industry consultation and the Internet Society is concerned that the costs have been significantly underestimated, especially in respect of small to medium sized ISPs (Internet Service Providers) that don‚Äôt have the resources to undertake the work in- house and therefore will be required to pay for external assistance.\\" == Lawfully circumventing the data retention scheme == Opposition to the mandatory data retention scheme has led to commentary from both media and politicians on ways in which the scheme may be lawfully circumvented. Writing in the Australian Financial Review, journalist Laura Tingle identified a number of methods for circumvention including the use of phone me via a provider Skype, advertising supported email services such as Google's Gmail and instant messaging service, Facebook Messenger. In an interview with Sky News, then Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull suggested journalists could avoid leaving a data trail through using over-the-top applications: \\"If you have a device, a smartphone and if I call you through the mobile phone network then there will be a record at Telstra that I called your number.\\" \\"If on the other hand, I communicate via Skype, for a voice call, or Viber, or I send you a message on Whatsapp or Wickr or Threema or Signal or Telegram ‚Äì there‚Äôs a gazillion of them ‚Äì or indeed if we have a Facetime call, then all that the telco can see insofar as they can see anything is that my device had a connection with the, say, the Skype server or the Whatsapp server‚Ä¶. it doesn‚Äôt see anything happen with you‚Ä¶. It‚Äôs important I think for journalists to remember.\\" Greens Senator Scott Ludlam, an outspoken opponent of the data retention scheme, delivered a speech in the Senate encouraging Australians to utilise virtual private networks (VPNs) and free services such as The Onion Router (Tor) to anonymously access the Internet. Senator Ludlam also organised events, cryptoparties, teaching constituents the ways they can avoid having telecommunications data retained. The accuracy of this advice has, however, been questioned by technology experts. Swinburne University academic Philip Branch has pointed out that while the content of Skype calls is encrypted, the IP addresses of participants may be collected and traced back to individuals. Branch has also argued that many offshore email services are based in the United States, and as such Australian enforcement agencies may be able to access information through the \\"Five Eyes\\" agreement, under which Australia, the United States, the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Canada have committed to share intelligence. As the law is able to be circumvented, the Australian Government is seeking to close the loophole offered by encrypted messaging services and TOR. == References  External links == *Attorney General's Department (2015-01-16). \\"Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment (Data Retention) Bill 2014 - Submission 27.\\" Available at: http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Joint/Intelligence_and_Security/Data_Retention/Submissions *Australian Privacy Foundation (2015-01-19). \\"Inquiry into Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment (Data Retention) Bill 2014 - Submission 75\\" (http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Joint/Intelligence_and_Security/Data_Retention/Submissions).

They are considered the first race riots in Canada, and are one of the early recorded race riots in North America. The Shelburne Riot is the first recorded race riot in Canada and is often described as North America's first race riot.Race was a factor in many of the forty riots and six black rebellions recorded in pre-revolutionary America:Review: Howard Zinn, A People's History of the American Revolution; libcom.org and black populations were repeatedly targeted for mass persecution in the wake of real or imagined slave insurrections in 1712, 1731, 1741: \\"Racial Violence in the United States Since 1660\\", Black Past ==Origins== Black Nova Scotian wood cutter at Shelburne, Nova Scotia in 1788. The town of Shelburne was created in 1783 as a settlement for United Empire Loyalists, who were American colonists who had sided with the British during the American War of Independence. Briefly the fourth-largest city in North America and the largest British North American city in the continent, the city of 10,000 people included over 1,500 African American slaves who had ran away from their American masters to join the British.James W. St. G. Walker, The Black Loyalists, University of Toronto Press (1992) p. 52 The British had promised them freedom, and the Crown granted them land in Birchtown, six miles outside Shelburne, but many also worked and lived in the town. Tensions rose in Shelburne in the spring of 1784. Delays in supplies and awarding land grants created anger and frustration among the many disbanded soldiers, who suffered in the frontier town. They sought jobs while waiting for the land grants promised for their military service, but had to compete with Black Loyalists, who received even fewer land grants and smaller rations, but were willing to work for smaller wages. David George, a popular black Baptist clergyman, became a lightning rod for racist anger. He had founded a Baptist church in Shelburne and attracted many followers, both black and white. In the spring of 1784, as David George prepared to baptize white couple William and Deborah Holmes, a small mob of Deborah's relatives disrupted the service to stop the event. Shelburne magistrates were called and ruled that the couple were free to be baptised in a church of their choosing. The baptism went ahead, but racial tension grew among landless white Loyalists.Stephen Kimber, Loyalists and Layabouts, pp. 177‚Äì178 ==The Riot== On the night of July 25, the riot began as a large group of white men attacked David George and the Black Loyalists in Shelburne. George's home and 20 other homes of free Blacks in Shelburne were destroyed in the first night of rioting.Walker, p. 48 Many of the free Blacks fled to Birchtown for safety. George stayed and continued to preach in Shelburne but at his next service a number of white rioters stormed into the church and threatened him. The next day they attacked him, beating him with sticks until he escaped into swampy area outside of Shelburne. He returned at night to rescue his wife and children and they sought shelter in Birchtown along with most of the free Blacks who had formerly lived and worked in Shelburne.‚ÄúAn Account of Life of Mr. David George from S. L. A. given by himself. In a conversation with Brother Rippon of London and Brother Pearce in Birmingham‚Äù, Black Loyalists: Our History, Our Heritage The Loyalist land agent in Shelburne, Benjamin Marston, wrote after the first day of rioting, \\"Great Riot today. The disbanded soldiers have risen against the free negroes to drive them out of town because they labour more cheaply.\\" The next day the rioters attacked Marston's house. He escaped to the military barracks across the harbour and that afternoon boarded a coastal schooner headed for Halifax, shortly before rioters arrived at the barracks reportedly intent on hanging him.Kimber, 185-186 Attacks by rioters continued in town for ten days, targeting some white Loyalists, such as Thomas and James Courtney, who had received large land grants on the Roseway River to set up a sawmill. The Courtneys were wealthy enough to hire armed guards to protect their properties.Kimber, p. 185 Attacks continued for another month against Black Loyalists, as rioters made incursions against the Black settlement at Birchtown.Walker, p. 49 Black Loyalists, many of whom were also army veterans, organized into militia companies. Initially they could defend themselves but were unable to quell the continuing violence. Attacks on Blacks traveling along the road between Birchtown and Shelburne for work and supplies continued for a month. Reports of the attacks spread around Nova Scotia; Simeon Perkins, in the town of Liverpool to the east, wrote, \\"An extraordinary mob or riot has happened at Shelburne. Some thousands of people assembled Clubs and Drove the Negroes out of the Town.\\"Simeon Perkins,‚Äò‚ÄòDiary of Simeon Perkins, Champlain Society Vol. II, July 29, 1784, p. 238 The mob was stopped by the arrival of troops from the 17th Regiment of Foot, later assisted by crew of a frigate. ==Aftermath== Dozens of homes, mostly of Black Loyalists, had been destroyed in the riots while others were looted. An unknown number of people were injured. No deaths were recorded. Most rioters wounded and threatened their targets; few owned firearms.All accounts describe rioters armed with clubs and sticks, and none note deaths. While racist bias in official accounts of the time may have overlooked the deaths of Black Loyalists, neither of the two accounts written by Black Loyalists in Shelburne (by David George or Boston King) recorded any deaths. Free Blacks had essentially been driven out of the town of Shelburne, firmly establishing it as a segregated white community, aside from Black slaves and indentured servants. Black Loyalists were forced to seek a livelihood in the poor lands and overcrowded settlement of Birchtown. The Governor of Nova Scotia, John Parr,traveled to Shelburne on August 23 to attempt to settle the disputes and delays in land grants. Parr blamed the riot on delays in awarding land. He blamed Marston, calling him \\"a shark trying to prey on helpless settlers\\". Marston was dismissed from his post. None of the rioters who attacked the Black Loyalists or Marston was identified or brought to justice.Marion Robertson, Kings Bounty: A History of Early Shelburne, Nova Scotia, Nova Scotia Museum (1983) p. 128 When whites attacked some Mi'kmaq people at Shelburne in November, the ringleader Edward Cavan was put in the stocks and sentenced to six months in prison.Robertson, p. 133 Despite the eventual settlement of Loyalist land grants in 1785, the economy of Shelburne collapsed in the late 1780s. It suffered the lack of agricultural land, a collapse of the whale fishery, and poor inland trade routes: four-fifths of the population left for other settlements.Walker, p. 52 David George and more than 1200 Black Loyalists fled the racism and poverty of Shelburne in 1792 to settle in Freetown, Sierra Leone. In this new colony in West Africa, they became known as The Nova Scotian Settlers. Scholars such as James Walker have interpreted the riots as caused by the economic predicaments of the Loyalists, which aggravated racial hostility.Walker, p. 49 Marston is regarded by many scholars as a scapegoat for the larger problems of Loyalist land settlements and racism in the community. Some white Loyalists still held slaves; other resented competing with blacks for the limited number of jobs.Kimber, p. 188 ==Depictions in popular culture== The Shelburne riots were dramatized in the BBC Two docudrama series Rough Crossings, based on the history of the same name by Simon Schama. The riots are also depicted in fiction in the novel The Book of Negroes by Lawrence Hill and the adapted television miniseries of the same name. The authors changed the date of the riot in the latter two works to fit the fictional narrative. In addition, the riots are depicted as a mass lynching with hangings, multiple murders, and a church burning, which was not documented in fact. ==ReferencesExternal links== * :Black Loyalists: Our History, Our People, section \\"Shelburne Riot\\" ** : \\"David George\\", at Black Loyalist * The Shelburne Race Riots, The Canadian Encyclopedia Category:Race riots in Canada Category:History of Nova Scotia Category:United Empire Loyalists Category:Black Loyalists Category:1784 in Nova Scotia Category:Shelburne County, Nova Scotia Category:African Americans in the American Revolution Category:British-American history Category:Clergy in the American Revolution Category:Human rights abuses Category:Refugees in Canada Category:Refugees in the United Kingdom Category:Aftermath of war ","title":"Shelburne riots"},{"id":"46850030","text":"The John Deere 4010 was an American farm tractor in production by the John Deere Company from 1960 to 1963. The 4010 was the primary attraction of the new ‚Äú10‚Äù series known as the ‚ÄúNew Generation‚Äù or ‚ÄúNew Generation of Power‚Äù which consisted of four and six-cylinder tractors first introduced in 1959 to replace the two-cylinder tractors which led to the great success of John Deere as a tractor manufacturer until that time. The \\"10\\" series tractors were introduced to John Deere dealers in dramatic fashion on August 30, 1960 when dealers from around the world were invited to Dallas, Texas where the entire new series was debuted at the Dallas Memorial Auditorium. The 4010 was rated at 80 horsepower in 1960, but tested at 84 horsepower during Nebraska field testing trials making it one of the most powerful two wheel drive farm tractors at that time. The 4010 was the predecessor to the 4020 which is widely regarded as the most popular tractor ever produced by John Deere and perhaps any other tractor manufacturer in the United States. Although the 4020 would later hold greater popularity, it was the 4010 that catapulted John Deere into the modern era of farm tractor technology and design following its successful history as a tractor manufacturer that was by then experiencing waning market share due to its aging two-cylinder engine technology. In addition to the advanced engine technology, the ‚Äú10‚Äù series tractors offered many other upgrades from the older two-cylinder models including significantly higher horsepower-to-weight ratio, advanced hydraulics, more convenient and comfortable operator station as well as many other improvements. Of the ‚Äú10‚Äù series John Deere tractors introduced in 1959, the 4010 was by far the most popular with more than 58,000 units sold from 1960 to 1963. The success of the ‚Äú10‚Äù series John Deere tractors, led by the 4010, helped propel John Deere from a 23% market share in 1959 to 34% by 1964 when the 4020 was introduced making it the top manufacturer of farm equipment in the United States. ==Elvis Presley== Elvis acquired a 1963 model 4010 in 1967, with his purchase of Twinkletown Farm. The tractor was shortly after taken to his Graceland home where it was on daily duty until 2008. Following its retirement and replacement with a fresh John Deere tractor, it was restored by students at Northwest Mississippi Community College and placed on display at the Elvis Presley Memphis Museum. A licensed 1/16 toy replica of Elvis's tractor was produced by the Ertl Company. ==ReferencesExternal links== * https://www.deere.com/en_US/docs/Corporate/fans_visitors/publications/plowshare_issue14.pd * https://www.deere.com/en_US/corporate/our_company/about_us/history/timeline/timeline.page Category:Tractors Category:John Deere vehicles ","title":"John Deere 4010"},{"id":"46850045","text":"Astro B.yond is a Malaysian first High-Definition Television (HDTV) service from Astro.

Drawing by Thomas Falcon Marshall. Hulme Hall was a manor house adjacent to the River Irwell in Hulme, Manchester, England. A structure of this name existed from at least the time of Henry II (1133‚Äì1189) until its demolition around 1840 during development related to the Bridgewater Canal. Owners included the Prestwich and the Mosley baronets prior to the property being bought from George Lloyd in 1764 by Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater. == Description == The hall was a manor house. It was a half- timbered building comprising two stories and built round a quadrangle, situated on a rise of red sandstone that overlooked the River Irwell in the township of Hulme, Manchester. It was well known for its gardens in the 18th century but was demolished around 1840 as part of the development of the Bridgewater Canal. It had been noted to be in poor condition in 1807 and by that time was leased to various poor tenants. Some 16th-century carved oak panels were removed to Worsley Old Hall around 1833. == Ownership == Hulme Hall, Manchester, England, . The building was owned by John de Hulme during the reign of Henry II and by the de Rossindale family by the time of Edward I. During the reign of Henry IV, it was owned by a branch of the family of Prestwich baronets and remained with them for centuries, with a five-year interlude when it was in the possession of Henry de Byrom. Sir Thomas Prestwich sold it to Sir Edward Mosley, 2nd Baronet, in 1660‚Äì61. Mosley died without a direct heir at the age of 27 in 1665 and there then followed much litigation regarding his estate, made more complex by various subsequent deaths. In 1695, ownership passed to John Bland, a member of the Bland baronets and Member of Parliament for Lancashire between 1713 and 1727. Bland had married Mosley's sole surviving heir, Anne. According to Edward Baines, around this time the hall was \\"among the most stately residences in the parish of Manchester\\". George Lloyd, a Fellow of the Royal Society, bought the hall in 1751. In 1764 the property passed into ownership of the Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater, who had to pay a large amount of money to acquire it so that he could continue construction of his eponymous canal. A hidden hoard of treasure was reputed to exist at the hall, although it was never discovered. Supposedly, this was the property of the mother of Thomas Prestwich, whose urgings of her son to advance money to Charles I probably contributed to his financial problems. == Depictions == The hall was central to Sir John Chiverton, a romantic novel co-written by William Harrison Ainsworth, and among those who produced illustrations of it was Charles Allen Duval. == References == Notes Citations Category:Former buildings and structures in Manchester Category:Manor houses in England ","title":"Hulme Hall, Hulme"},{"id":"46850151","text":"Eulwangri Beach, near Incheon Airport This is a list of beaches in South Korea. * Haeundae Beach, Busan * Gwangalli Beach, Busan * Songdo Beach, Busan * Dadaepo Beach, Busan * Gyeongpo Beach, Gangneung * Daecheon Beach, Boryeong * Eulwangri Beach, Yeongjongdo, Incheon * Wangsan Beach, Yeongjongdo, Incheon * Hanagae Beach, Muuido * Hyeopjae Beach, Jeju Island * Jungmoon Beach, Jeju Island ==References== * South Korea Beaches Beaches ","title":"List of beaches in South Korea"},{"id":"46850161","text":"The 1950 All-SEC football team consists of American football players selected to the All-Southeastern Conference (SEC) chosen by various selectors for the 1950 college football season.

Unlike syllabics, it is a true alphabet, with separate letters for consonants and vowels, though vowels are written before the consonants they follow in speech. It was published in 2012 by Tamara Kearney, Manager of Braille Research and Development at the Commonwealth Braille and Talking Book Cooperative. The book ·êÉ·ìï·êä·ïê·î™·íÉ ·ìá·ìÑ·ïê·ìó The Orphan and the Polar Bear was the first (and perhaps only) work transliterated into Inuktitut Braille. ==Chart== Each letter of Inuktitut syllabics is transliterated with two braille cells. The first cell indicated the orientation of the syllabic letter, and the second its shape. Since the orientation of a letter indicates the vowel of a syllable, and shape indicates the consonant, this means that the syllable ki, for example, is written ik. Vowel length, indicated with a diacritic dot in syllabics, is written by adding an extra dot to the consonant letter in braille, so that the syllable kƒ´ is effectively written iƒ∑ in braille. ===Vowels=== The four vowel letters are as follows: :{ class=\\" Unicode\\" style=\\"line-height: 1.2\\" - align=center  ai  i  u  a } The vowels u and a mimic the orientations of some consonants carrying these vowels, being practically identical to the null-consonant syllables ·êÖ u and ·êä a as well as to ·ê≥ pu and ·ê∏ pa. Vowel letters do not occur alone, but are carried by a null consonant to write a vowel-initial syllable. For a long vowel, a dot is added to the null consonant letter, . Thus the syllables consisting of a vowel only are written: : ·êÅ ai : ·êÉ i : ·êÑ ƒ´ : ·êÖ u : ·êÜ ≈´ : ·êä a : ·êã ƒÅ Consonants follow English Braille as closely as possible. For example, the Latin consonant letter k is in braille, and this is used for the consonant sound in Inuktitut Braille as well. is used alone for at the end of a syllable (in syllabics, ·íÉ). Syllables beginning with combine with a vowel cell, as follows: : ·ë´ kai : ·ë≠ ki : ·ëØ ku : ·ë≤ ka And with long vowels: : ·ëÆ kƒ´ : ·ë∞ k≈´ : ·ë≥ kƒÅ These vowel letters are used consistently, according to the spoken phonemic vowel, regardless of whether the orientation of symmetry of the syllabic letter is orthogonal in print, as in the null consonant above, or diagonal, as in k. ===Consonants=== Inuktitut braille consonants were chosen according to romanized Inuktitut rather than syllabics. For example, ·ñÖ q is written with the single letter , braille q, rather than as ·ïê r plus ·íÉ k as it is in syllabics. Consonant assignments differ somewhat from English and international conventions. Since v in English Braille, , has a dot at position 6, which is used for long vowels in Inuktitut Braille, the letter for the similar sound f, , was substituted for ·ïù v. The Inuktitut letters for ng, nng, and ≈Ç have no simple equivalent in English Braille, so the braille letters for English e, d, and c are used.The source contradicts itself on this point, also saying that is used for ≈Ç,and gives no textual examples to clarify. However, that would mean that ≈Ç with a long vowel would be written , identical to the vowel a. We assume, therefore, that is a printing error and that is correct.

Inuktitut syllabics are irregular for the last few letters: ng and nng are only diacritics, and require a carrying letter g to support a vowel; ≈Ç has irregular rotation, and h is a diacritic requiring the null consonant to support a vowel. In Inuktitut Braille, however, they behave as any other consonant, so that all CV syllables are written with two braille cells regardless of how the consonant is written in syllabics. For example, ·ô± nngi is just , and ·ïº·êÉ hi is just . ===Digits and punctuation=== Digits and punctuation are identical to those of Unified English Braille with two exceptions: is used for the Grade 1 indicator which would only be employed when indicating a grade 1 passage in English or other contracted languages since Inuktitut Braille does not have grades, and is used for the \\"single\\" indicator the purpose of which is to indicate the use of a single glyph used outside any other context or glyphs from other writing systems. ==Examples== The following is a sample text, first in braille, then in syllabics and romanization. :‚†ï‚†Å‚†™‚†ü‚†ò‚†á‚†™‚†≠‚†ò‚†ó‚†û‚†Ä‚†ï‚†Å‚†™‚†ü‚†ï‚†Å‚†ò‚†é‚†™‚†ü‚†ü‚†ï‚†û‚†ò‚†ù‚†Ö :·êÖ·ñÉ·ìï·í´·ïÜ·ë¶ ·êÖ·ñÉ·êÖ·ìØ·ñÉ·ñÖ·ëê·ìÇ·íÉ :uqalimƒÅrit uqausiqaqtunit :‚†ò‚†Å‚†ï‚†ù‚†ï‚†ü‚†ò‚†û‚†û‚†™‚†û‚†Ç‚†Ä‚†ò‚†Å‚†ò‚†á‚†ü‚†ï‚†Ö‚†ò‚†é‚†ï‚†ü‚†ò‚†û‚†û‚†™‚†û‚†Ç :·êÉ·ìÑ·ñÅ·ëé·ë¶·ëï, ·êÉ·ìï·ñÖ·ëØ·ìØ·ñÅ·ëé·ë¶·ëï, :inuqutitta, iliqkusiqutitta, :‚†ï‚†°‚†™‚†ç‚†ï‚†ö‚†û‚†Ç‚†Ä‚†ò‚†Å‚†ò‚†á‚†™‚†û‚†ò‚†ó‚†™‚†ö‚†ï‚†Å‚†ö‚†ï‚†ö‚†ò‚†û‚†û‚†™‚†û‚†Ç :·êÜ·í™·î™·ë¶, ·êÉ·ìï·ëï·ïÜ·î≠·êÖ·îæ·î™·ëé·ë¶·ëï, :≈´majut, ilitarijaujjutitta, :‚†ò‚†è‚†ò‚†õ‚†™‚†Å‚†ó‚†ò‚†ù‚†ò‚†ó‚†™‚†á‚†ï‚†Å‚†ü‚†™‚†û‚†û‚†™‚†û‚†Ç :·ê±·íã·êä·ïê·ìÇ·ïÜ·ìö·êÖ·ñÖ·ëï·ë¶·ëï, :pigiarnirilauqtatta, :‚†ï‚†ù‚†™‚†ù‚†ï‚†ã‚†™‚†æ‚†ü‚†ò‚†é‚†™‚†ç‚†ò‚†ù‚†û‚†™‚†û‚†ï‚†á :·ìÑ·ìá·ïó·ëñ·ñÖ·ìØ·í™·ìÇ·ë¶·ëï·ìó :nunavutƒÅqsimanittalu :‚†ò‚†ç‚†Ö‚†™‚†Æ‚†ï‚†Ω‚†™‚†ë‚†ï‚†ö‚†ò‚†ù‚†Ö‚†Ç‚†Ä‚†™‚†Å‚†ç‚†™‚†ç‚†ï‚†á :·í•·íÉ·ìµ·ìÖ·ñì·î™·ìÇ·íÉ, ·êä·íª·í™·ìó :miksƒÅn≈´ngajunik, ammalu :‚†™‚†Å‚†ò‚†ç‚†ï‚†é‚†Ö‚†™‚†Ö‚†ù‚†ò‚†ù‚†ó‚†ò‚†ù‚†Ö‚†≤ :·êä·í•·ì±·íÉ·ë≤·ìê·ìÇ·ïê·ìÇ·íÉ. :amisukkannirnik. ==References== * Inuktitut Braille discussion and charts ==See also== *I√±upiaq Braille Category:French-ordered braille alphabets Category:Inuktitut Category:Writing systems introduced in 2012 ","title":"Inuktitut Braille"},{"id":"46850166","text":"Blast Monkeys is a physics based mobile puzzle video game developed by American studio Yobonja and was released for iOS in January 2011 and Android in February 2011.

After his training in pathology at the Hammersmith Hospital in London, United Kingdom, he returned to India to continue experimental toxicology research initially at the Central Drug Research Institute, and then as Founding Director at Industrial Toxicology Research Center (ITRC) in Lucknow (1965-1978) (now renamed as Indian Institute of Toxicology Research, IITR).Indian Institute of Toxicology Research During his later years, he served on national and international (mainly World Health Organization) committees to increase awareness and set policy to prevent the harmful effects of industrial toxins in people. == Early life and career == Sibte Hasan Zaidi was born in Barabanki, India and grew up in the village town of Jarwal with his maternal uncle because of the early death of his mother, Zakia Begum. Thereafter, he studied at Barabanki High School and lived initially with his father, Syed Hasan Zaidi, a barrister-at-law from the Inner Temple, London, who practised civil law. Upon the death of his father in 1931, Sibte Zaidi moved in with his uncle, Sardar Husain, also a barrister from Lincoln's Inn in London. Educated thereafter in Christian College and Lucknow University, Sibte Zaidi entered King George‚Äôs Medical College (KGMC, now King George's Medical University, Lucknow, in 1940, and graduated with a medical degree (Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery) in 1945. In 1948, he married Qamar Ara Shanshah Husain granddaughter of the Rajah of Bhatwamau, who was a clinical child psychologist (and founded the School for Mentally Disabled Children, Chetna, in Lucknow, India). After his clinical training and a brief academic appointment in Pathology at KGMC, Sibte Zaidi left for the United Kingdom to work under the tutelage of Professor Earl J. King, the discoverer of the alkaline phosphatase unitage, the King-Armstrong Units, at the Postgraduate Medical School (later to be named the Royal Postgraduate Medical School, now Imperial College, London) and the Hammersmith Hospital in London. During his tenure at the Hammersmith, Zaidi also trained in Clinical Pathology and was awarded a PhD (1954) and a Diploma in Clinical Pathology (1952), both from the University of London. == Research == Around ca 1950, King had developed an interest in the health of coal miners in the Sheffield area. Zaidi, as King‚Äôs PhD student, provided a description of the pathology and pathophysiology of coal miner‚Äôs lung. According to J.S. Faulds, Zaidi and coworkers \\"produced the nearest approach to massive fibrosis by injecting into sensitized animals dust plus tubercle bacilli\\", importantly, as tuberculosis was prevalent at the time. In 1955, Zaidi travelled back to India to be named Head the Division of Experimental Medicine and then Deputy Director at Central Drug Research Institute (CDRI) in Lucknow, where his research focused on mechanisms that underlie peptic ulcer, atherosclerosis, vasospasm, and eosinophilia. Through a complement of pharmacologic and animal studies, Zaidi and his colleagues demonstrated the requirement of a mucus barrier in the prevention of peptic ulcer disease. For this, as noted on the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research website, he received the Sir Shanti Swaroop Bhatnagar Award for the scientific excellence (1963). He also made contributions to understanding the process of atherosclerosis, where he not only examined the mechanisms of hypercoaguability and thrombosis, but also developed rodent models of atherosclerotic heart disease and experimental myocardial infarction. Between 1964 and 1965, Dr. Zaidi served as the third Director of the newly founded Indian Institute of Biochemistry and Experimental Medicine in Calcutta (renamed Indian Institute of Chemical Biology), where he established the institute's research infrastructure, and initiated research on industrial toxins to dissect and clarify, at a more fundamental level, the mechanisms of pulmonary fibrosis following exposure to a wide range of toxins, including asbestos, silica, mica, wood dust, and bagasse. == Industrial Toxicology Research Center (ITRC) == This work provided the stimulus for the emergence of a new discipline of Industrial Toxicology in India, where toxic exposure had remained an unrecognised health hazard. Dr. Zaidi became the Founding Director of the first institute in South East Asia ‚Äì Industrial Toxicology Research Center (ITRC) in Lucknow (now renamed as Indian Institute of Toxicology Research, IITR).Indian Institute of Toxicology Research It moved from its temporary CDRI quarters to the current building, as of 2015. The premises were visited by the then President of India, V. V. Giri, and the new buildings dedicated on 27 July 1976 by President Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed, per a \\"News Item\\" published in Clinical Toxicology, which also comments on the role of Dr. Zaidi in nurturing many areas of industrial toxicology. Beginning as a modest sized set of laboratories with few interested scientists, ITRC witnessed growth during the late 1960s and 1970s. There were only few other centres of excellence that were involved in research in Industrial Toxicology worldwide, including those headed by Professor Schilipkoter in D√ºsseldorf, Germany, and Dr. Erwing Selikoff at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York. During his tenure at ITRC, Zaidi continued to work on cellular mechanisms through which asbestos, silica and other dusts as well as other industrial toxins affected human health (for example ). His research was funded continuously by the Public Health Service of the United States through their PL480 scheme. == Publications == Dr. Zaidi's monograph \\"Experimental Pneumoconiosis\\" was published by Johns Hopkins Press in 1969. In addition, over 140 publications resulted from this work. == Recognition == Dr Zaidi was awarded the William P. Yant Award for lifetime achievements and contributions to industrial toxicology by the American Industrial Hygiene Association in 1977. He also served on the Editorial Board of the American Industrial Hygiene Association (1977-1993). The Venezuelan Society also gave him the highest honour for his contributions to industrial medicine (1978). For his work in India, he was awarded the Sir Ardeshirlal Dalal Gold Medal for his contributions to occupational health (1975), and a national honour the Padam Shree (1977) by the Government of India. Dr. Zaidi was inducted as the Founding Member of the Royal College of Pathologists, and thereafter was conferred a Fellowship. On the national front, he was inducted as a Fellow of the National Academy of Medical Sciences of India (1976), the National Academy of Sciences, India (1972) and the Indian National Science Academy (1974). These honors are listed in his official obituary published by the Indian Institute of Toxicology Research. In recognition of his contributions to ITRC, an endowed annual lectureship, Professor SH Zaidi Memorial Oration, was established in 1998. The 12th oration was given by his son, Professor Mone Zaidi. == Policy == During his tenure as Director of ITRC, Dr. Zaidi served on multiple national, governmental and international committees, and was an Indian delegate to various parts of the world including Germany, France, United Kingdom, United States, Egypt, and USSR, with a brief to promote industrial toxicology and initiate research collaborations. In 1975, he hosted \\"The International Symposium on Industrial Toxicology\\" in Lucknow, which showcased the then cutting-edge science in the field of industrial medicine. He was thereafter inducted as President of the Asian Society of Environmental Industrial Toxicology (1975). He was also Professor at the Azad University in Kanpur, and Visiting Professor to the University of D√ºsseldorf on two occasions, where he participated in further studies on the action of toxic metals. Dr. Zaidi served on multiple international and national policy committees, including those of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), World Health Organization (WHO), and the International Labor Organization (ILO). His work on the World Health Organization's Expert Committees became the basis of two key technical reports (Technical Report Series). He was also Advisor to the Occupational Health Committee of the WHO, Member of the Scientific Advisory Committee of the UN International Registry on Potentially Toxic Chemicals in Geneva (1977-1979), Senior Consultant to the United Nations Environmental Program (1982), and WHO Consultant in Bangladesh and Burma. He also established international courses on preventive toxicology under the United Nations in Switzerland, USSR, Czechoslovakia and Germany. To promote the cause of industrial medicine, he founded two further institutes for outreach research in Rangoon (1982-1984) and Sri Lanka (1979), under the aegis of the United Nations. In India, he served as Honorary Advisor to the Ministry of Railways, a position that he retained between 1978 and 1989. His Editorial \\"Bhopal and After,\\" published in the American Journal of Industrial Medicine, and later quoted in several articles, highlighted gaps in policy that could lead to spillage of chemicals of such magnitude, even in the 1980s. He subsequently chaired the Environmental Research Committee of the Ministry of Environment of the Government of India between 1990 and 1993. == Later life == During the late 1990s and thereafter, Dr. Zaidi lived intermittently in India, the United Kingdom and the United States with his son, Mone Zaidi, who is currently physician and Professor of Medicine at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York. Dr. Zaidi died peacefully at his home in Riverdale, New York, on 5 April 2008 (obituary in ). He is survived by his son, his daughter- in-law, Meenakshi Zaidi, a physician and Patient Care Center Director and Chief of Primary Care, Women's Health, Geriatrics and Preventive Medicine at the Veteran‚Äôs Affairs Medical Center in New York and Assistant Professor at Columbia University, and his two grandchildren, Neeha Zaidi, MD, currently a Assistant Professor of Oncology at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, and Samir Zaidi, MD, PhD, currently fellow in Oncology at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and Visiting Fellow in the Lifton Lab at Rockefeller University in New York. ==References== Category:1918 births Category:2008 deaths Category:Indian pathologists Category:Indian toxicologists Category:Indian Muslims Category:People from Barabanki district Category:Medical doctors from Uttar Pradesh Category:Recipients of the Padma Shri in science & engineering Category:University of Lucknow alumni Category:Alumni of Imperial College London Category:Fellows of the Indian National Science Academy Category:Fellows of The National Academy of Sciences, India Category:Indian medical researchers Category:Indian medical writers Category:20th-century Indian medical doctors Category:Recipients of the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Award in Medical Science ","title":"Sibte Hasan Zaidi"},{"id":"46850174","text":"Kongarpalayam is a panchayat village in Gobichettipalayam taluk in Erode District of Tamil Nadu state, India.

He is a biblical scholar, practical theologian and social critic, as well as an innovative educator and church planter. ==Early life== Robert Banks was born in Sydney in 1939, raised and educated there, and studied arts/law at Sydney University. Author information with Trove, https://trove.nla.gov.au/people/458535?c=people. Retrieved 30 December, 2019. A longer biographical sketch can be found in the introduction to a Festschrift for Robert Banks edited by Simon Holt and Gordon Preece, The Bible and the Business of Life: Essays in Honour of Robert J. Banks' Sixty-Fifth Birthday, ATF Press, 2004, ix - xvi. In 1959 he entered Moore Theological College and on graduating three years later married Julie Lonsdale Johnson. After ordination and ministry at Holy Trinity Anglican Church in Adelaide, he completed an MTh at King's College in the University of London and a PhD in New Testament on Jesus' attitude to the Law at Clare College Cambridge University. In 1969 he resigned from the Anglican Church on the grounds of its status distinction between clergy and laity, its ceremonial view of the sacraments and its over- emphasis on its members serving the institution and activities of the church rather than fulfilling their vocation in and witnessing to the world. Returning to Australia in 1969, he was appointed as a Research Fellow in the History of Ideas Unit at the Australian National University, Canberra. During this time he helped develop several home-based congregations in the city, was also a theological consultant to people of faith in the Public Service and started a theological program for lay people.An account of his role in the establishing and development of these more organic and interactive, societal and cultural involved groups in Canberra may be found at http://www.home- church.org/canberra.html In 1974 he became Senior Lecturer in Ancient History at Macquarie University, Sydney. His publications during this time included books on early Christian idea of community, the tyranny of time, private values and public policy, and going to church in the first century. ==Midlife== In 1989 he was invited to become Foundation Professor in The Ministry of the Laity at Fuller Theological Seminary, Los Angeles, where he introduced a Master of Arts in Christian Leadership for lay people and a Doctorate in Practical Theology. Three highlights of this period were helping to found a national Coalition for Ministry in Daily Life, serve on the Board of InterVarsity Fellowship's Marketplace Ministries and nurturing independent and denominational home-based congregations in Los Angeles and other parts of North America. In the mid-1990s he became the first Executive Director of the De Pree Leadership Center at Fuller Seminary, working among business, media and professional people as well as with church, para-church and missionary leaders. His lifelong interest in film led to his becoming the first Director of an annual City of the Angels Film Festival, held annually at the Director's Guild in Los Angeles. This focussed on mainstream and independent films containing spiritual and moral themes. Along with books on the God as worker and re-envisioning theological education, he wrote and edited others on relating faith to work, leading with spirit, and Christianity in everyday life. Alongside being a Visiting Professor in theological institutions in Korea, Canada, Russia and Switzerland, he networked with facilitators of simpler, grassroots forms of christian gathering in a range of non- denominational, inter-denominational, and mainline denominational settings in overseas courses. ==Later life== In early 1999 he returned to Australia where, shortly afterwards, his wife Julie died of a brain tumour. He then became the first Director and Dean of the Christian Studies Institute at Macquarie University, Sydney, which offered degree level courses to university students and professional development for Christians in the workplace. In late 2000 he married Linda Hope, who had been a Staff Worker for the Australian Fellowship of Evangelical Students and an Associate Pastor in a number of churches. In the following years he wrote books on everyday theology, religion in film, and apologetics.A preliminary assessment of Robert Banks' theological contribution has been written by Geoff R. Treloar, \\"Three Contemporary Christian Radicals in Australia - Robert Banks, Stuart Piggin and Bruce Kaye\\", Agendas for Australian Anglicanism, ed. Tom Frame and Geoffrey Treloar, ATF Press, 2006, 195-229. In 2004 a Festschrift was produced in his honour with contributions from fifteen scholars around the world, including Edwin Judge, John Drane, Miroslav Volf and James Dunn.The Bible and the Business of Life: Essays in Honour of Robert J.

In 2019, a special issue of the journal Zadok Perspectives, containing articles by a number of Australian christian thinkers was issued to celebrate his 80th birthday. He and Linda also created several biblically-based resource materials for small groups, and written three books on the contribution of female Australian missionaries to the emergence of modern China, a country for which they have developed a great love and to which they have made multiple visits.

The lens is one of the classic professional soft-focus \\"portrait lenses\\". In a joint effort with the pioneering photographer Heinrich K√ºhn, who, as a pictorialist, was artistically seeking for \\"romantic softness without sugariness, blurring without a woolly effect\\" in images and had been experimenting with binocular lenses and soft filters and rasters in the 1920s already, the lens was technically designed by ,G. Kadlubek, R. Hillebrand: Kadlubeks Objektiv-Katalog. Ed. Photo-Deal, Neuss 2000, , S. 150. founder of the optical company in Munich, Germany. The resulting lens was marketed as Anachromat K√ºhn. Later in 1928,Wolfgang Baier: Quellendarstellungen zur Geschichte der Fotografie. 2. Auflage, Schirmer/Mosel, M√ºnchen 1980, , S. 536 the lens became the Tiefenbildner-Imagon, which was introduced by Rodenstock in 1930/1931 and produced up into the 1990s. The unusual term ' is a German composition, which can be best translated as \\"depth-of-field creator, modulator or painter\\" in an artistic sense; this designation was later dropped. Imagons do not typically have shutter mechanisms and are instead mounted on shutters (i.e., Copal large format shutters). There are also variants which can be mounted on focusing helicoids or bellows to be used with medium format or 35 mm cameras. All Imagons were originally sold with three different diffusion discs matched to its focal length. The Imagon equivalent to aperture size is determined by the interplay between the imagon lens central opening and the modifiable arrangement of smaller openings on the diffusion disc. These taken together produce an \\"H-stop\\" designation which approximates the corresponding f-stop of a normal lens. By rotating the outer rim of the disc, the opening of these smaller holes can be modified, and by this the amount of softness, which superimposes the sharper core of the image, is also changed. Wider H-stops, or more-open holes, mean more softness. Focus is set with the diffusion disc closed. The diffusion disc is then opened to the degree desired to record the image.Alfons Scholz, Lichtbilder mit dem Imagon, 1979 pg. 61. == List of lens models == List of known Anachromat K√ºhn Dr. Staeble lenses: *170 mm (A17; for 9√ó12 cm) *200 mm (A20; for 9√ó12 cm) *250 mm (A25; for 9√ó12 cm) *310 mm (A31, for 9√ó12 cm) List of known Rodenstock Imagon lenses: *90 mm (for 35 mm; prototype for pre-World War II Leica only) *120 mm H=4.5 (for 35 mm and 6√ó6 cm) *150 mm H=5.8 (for 6√ó6 cm) *170 mm H=5.4 (for 6√ó9 cm)Imagon - Rodenstock macht es Ihnen leicht *200 mm H=5.4 (for 9√ó12 cm) *200 mm H=5.8 (for 4.5√ó6 cm,Rodenstock - Das Imagon H5,8/200mm an Mittelformatkameras 6√ó6 cm, 6√ó7 cm, 6√ó9 cm, and 4√ó5\\") *250 mm H=5.4 (for 10√ó15 cm) *250 mm H=5.8 (for 4√ó5\\") *300 mm H=5.6 (for 13√ó18 cm) *300 mm H=7.7 (for 5√ó7\\")Brian Lewington: A History of the Imagon lens by Dr. Alfons Schultz *360 mm H=5.8 (for 16√ó21 cm and 8√ó10\\") *420 mm H=6.0 (for 18√ó24 cm) *480 mm H=6.2 (for 24√ó30 cm) == See also == * *Soft-focus lens *Bokeh *Depth-of-field == References  Further reading == * Alfons Scholz: Lichtbilder mit dem Imagon. vwi Verlag, Starnberg 1980 == External links == * Harold M.

The show consisted of five teams of one, two, three or four people with a pre-existing relationship competing to turn their vision for a restaurant into a reality. The teams were given the chance to design and run their own pop-up restaurant with viewers able to dine in and experience the food, service and atmosphere. The show was hosted by Scottish-born restaurateur Jock Zonfrillo. Teams are scored and judged by a panel of experts. The industry expert panel consists of Neil Perry (chef and restaurateur), Erez Gordon (front-of-house specialist), John Lethlean (food critic) and Jess Ho (brand strategist). They were also scored on how much profit they made each week. ==Restaurants and contestants== The teams were from the five largest capital cities in Australia. Their restaurants were constructed out of shipping containers located in an iconic spot for each city. The layout for every restaurant was identical and each seated 60 guests. It was up to the teams to determine the theme, atmosphere, exterior and interior details of their restaurants. All restaurants officially opened to the public on 14 July, a few weeks before they aired on the show. {  - valign=\\"top\\" ! City ! Location ! Restaurant ! Contestants -  Sydney   Somewhere Nice  Dom Aboud -  Adelaide   28 St  David, Asa, Reine and Anthony Donehue -  Brisbane   Puerto  -  Melbourne   Scarfo  Nathan Scarfo & Maz Koutsonikolas -  Perth   LA L√çNEA  Carmen & Nicole Watts } ==Competition details== * Restaurant Pre-opening - During this first stage of the competition, teams must earn cash to be able to build the interior of their restaurants, purchase supplies and prepare their staff. For each of the first two challenges, there was a total cash pool of $100,000 on offer. The experts distributed this cash based on how well the teams pitch or present their potential restaurant, food and service. The team who best meets the expert's requirements receives $40,000, second receives $20,000, third and fourth get $15,000 each and finally the worst performing team receives only $10,000. In the final 'last chance pitch', the experts only gave a total of $40,000 to the three best teams, with two teams missing out on the final cash offer. * Team Lunch - Each week, one team hosts a lunch inviting in all other teams, where they will be able to judge the food and service of each competing restaurant. Teams are given $50 to use for tips, which they can use up to all or none of. This process happens alongside the Weekly reviews. In Week 5, it was revealed that for every $10 tip, the team earns 1 point on their final scores. * Weekly Reviews - The experts will individually visit each of the restaurants on a weekly rotation. They judge the food and service based on their visit and give the team an overall score out of 10. A 5th 'secret critic' also joins the experts judging one team a week. Their identity remains anonymous, therefore teams do not know when or who will arrive to judge. Teams are also ranked for their profitability, with the team earning the highest profit margin getting 5 points added to the expert score and then the other teams ranked 4 to 1 point/s. The team with the highest overall score will gain one extra 4 seat table to use for the following week's service, while the lowest scoring team, loses a 4-seat table, which remains present but is taped off as if it was damaged. From Week 2, there are also chef's special challenges. The team who sells the most of this dish earns 2 bonus points on top of their profit score. ** Week 2 Chef's Special ‚Äì Teams are to create a 'chef's special' dish. It must be completely new and not a variation of their existing menu, priced at no lower than $15. ** Week 3 Chef's Special ‚Äì 'State on a plate'. Teams must create a special dish that represents their home state. ** Week 4 Chef's Special ‚Äî Teams must create a burger that represents their restaurant. { style=\\"text-align: center; font-size: 9pt; line- height:16px; width:100%\\" + Weekly progress, scores and cash earnings - valign=\\"top\\" -  rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"text-align: right\\"  Progress ! style=\\"width:10%\\" colspan=\\"3\\" Pre-opening Week ! colspan=\\"3\\" style=\\"width:15%\\" Week 1 ! colspan=\\"4\\" style=\\"width:15%\\" Week 2 ! colspan=\\"4\\" style=\\"width:15%\\" Week 3 ! colspan=\\"4\\" style=\\"width:15%\\" Week 4 ! colspan=\\"3\\" style=\\"width:15%\\" Week 5 ! colspan=\\"3\\" style=\\"width:15%\\" Week 6 ! rowspan=\\"3\\" Final Results -  colspan=\\"3\\" Cash earnings  rowspan=\\"2\\" Expert scores  rowspan=\\"2\\" ! rowspan=\\"2\\"  rowspan=\\"2\\" Team Lunch  rowspan=\\"2\\" Expert scores  rowspan=\\"2\\" ! rowspan=\\"2\\"  rowspan=\\"2\\" Team Lunch  rowspan=\\"2\\" Expert scores  rowspan=\\"2\\" ! rowspan=\\"2\\"  rowspan=\\"2\\" Team Lunch  rowspan=\\"2\\" Expert scores  rowspan=\\"2\\" ! rowspan=\\"2\\"  colspan=\\"2\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" Team Lunch  rowspan=\\"2\\" Total Tips  rowspan=\\"2\\" Expert scores  rowspan=\\"2\\" ! rowspan=\\"2\\" - ! style=\\"width:5%\\"  First Pitch  Cook For Cash  Last Chance Pitch -  bgcolor=\\"ED2939\\"  bgcolor=\\"lightgreen\\" $40,000  $15,000  $10,000  6 (John)  3  9  Tipped $0  7 (Jess)  4 (+2)  bgcolor=\\"lightgreen\\" 13  Host   4 (+2)  bgcolor=\\"lightgreen\\"14  Tipped $20  9 (Erez)  1  10  Tipped $10  Tipped $10  8 ($80)  7.5 (Neil)  3  10.5  bgcolor=\\"lightgreen\\" -  bgcolor=\\"00A0C4\\"  $20,000  $15,000  $10,000  5 (Erez)  5  bgcolor=\\"lightgreen\\" 10  Host   5  10  Tipped $10  6 (Jess)  3  9  Tipped $30  8 (Neil)  5 bgcolor=\\"lightgreen\\" 13  Tipped $10  Tipped $20  bgcolor=\\"pink\\"5 ($50)  8 (John)  5  13  2nd (60) -  bgcolor=\\"40E0D0\\"  bgcolor=\\"pink\\" $10,000  bgcolor=\\"lightgreen\\" $40,000  bgcolor=\\"pink\\" $0  6.5 (Neil)  2  8.5  Tipped $20  7.5 (Erez)  2  9.5  Tipped $20  6 (John)  2  bgcolor=\\"pink\\"8  Host   4 (+2)  bgcolor=\\"lightgreen\\" 13  Tipped $10  Tipped $0  bgcolor=\\"lightgreen\\"9 ($90)  6 (Jess)  4  10  3rd (58) -  bgcolor=\\"FC9E49\\"   $15,000  $20,000  bgcolor=\\"pink\\" $0  5.5 (Jess)  4  9.5  Tipped $20  6.5 (Neil)  1  bgcolor=\\"pink\\" 7.5  Tipped $30  7.5 (Erez)  5  12.5  Tipped $20  6.5 (John)  3 bgcolor=\\"pink\\" 9.5  Host  Tipped $30  6 ($60)   2  8  4th (53) -  bgcolor=\\"D74894\\"  $15,000  bgcolor=\\"pink\\" $10,000  bgcolor=\\"lightgreen\\" $20,000   1  bgcolor=\\"pink\\" 7  Tipped $10  7 (John)  3  10  Tipped $20  9 (Neil)  1  10  Tipped $20  8 (Jess)  2  10  Tipped $30  Host  6 ($60)  7 (Erez)  1  8  bgcolor=\\"pink\\"5th (51) } ==Episodes and ratings== Restaurant Revolution suffered low ratings during its launch.

It has recently been discovered in an interkingdom bacterial transfer with grapevine plants (Vitis vinifera), which is unexpected because P. acne is found on human skin. The bacterium colonizes in the bark tissue and the pith of the grapevine plant. P. zappae has endophytic characteristics which suggests that the bacterium has adapted to its new grapevine host as well as formed an endocellular symbiosis with the plant. P. acnes type zappae was named after the Italian term \\"zappa\\" (meaning hoe) and as a tribute to musician Frank Zappa who wrote about \\"sand- blasted zits\\". The unconventional behavior of this bacteria and its unique habitat caused scientists to immediately think of Zappa and name the bacteria after him. The age of P. zappae dates back to about 7,500 years ago, an age that reflects the early domestication of grapevine. ==References== Category:Propionibacterineae ","title":"Propionibacterium acnes type zappae"},{"id":"46851267","text":"Ganbold Davaakhuugiin (referred to as S√°rosdi Davaakhuu Ganbold or as Dav√°h√ºgijn Ganbold in Hungarian; born 16 August 1962) is a Mongolian literary historian and literary translator.

The first edition was positioned as being the ‚ÄòVoice of Bantam Progressivism‚Äô and was a success due to it being built on four principles: * The first was a commitment to be as professional and well written as possible. * The second was to be constructive and responsible when communicating criticism about the club. * The third was to include historical features about the club at a time when there was literally nothing in print about BCAFC. * The fourth was to be unashamedly proud of being Bradfordians. The name for the fanzine was taken from the mascot for Bradford City A.F.C. that was introduced in the 1960s by the club.BBC article on the City gent mascot and the design of the character was based on then chairman Stafford Heginbotham. In 2000 during Bradford City's spell in the Premier League the editors were banned from selling the fanzine at Bradford's last two away games, at Villa Park and Derby's Pride Park, because those clubs wished to protect their in-house publications.

In November 1942, during the Second World War, it was attacked in the Indian Ocean by two Japanese commerce raiders, one of which (the Hokoku Maru) was sunk possibly by a shell fired by the Ondina. After the war it continued operating until decommissioned and broken up in 1959. == Description == Displacing , Ondina was long with a beam of . The vessel had a draught of . Fitted with a single Werkspoor six-cylinder diesel engine that was capable of generating 2,800 hp, the ship had a top speed of 12 knots. Its armament consisted of a single 102 mm quick-firing gun and several machine guns. == Career == Launched in April 1939, Ondina was built at the NDSM shipyard in Amsterdam, in the Netherlands. Completed in August 1939, prior to the Second World War the vessel sailed for La Corona, a subsidiary of the Royal Dutch Shell company. === Second World War === In November 1942, Ondina took part in the battle against the Japanese auxiliary cruisers and raiders Aikoku Maru and Hokoku Maru where it was damaged; after which it was temporarily repaired and then sent to Exmouth Gulf in Western Australia where she was stationed from 22 June 1943 supplying fuel to US submarines. On 1 September 1943 the Ondina also supplied fuel to the ship MV Krait then taking part in Operation Jaywick, the raid on Singapore. At the end of 1943 the ship was sent to the US for repairs at Tampa, sailing via Melbourne, Balboa, Panama Canal and Galveston.  Action against Japanese raiders  On 11 November 1942, Ondina was sailing escorted by HMIS Bengal, a Bathurst class corvette, to the southwest of Cocos Islands in the Indian Ocean, when the Japanese commerce raiders Aikoku Maru and H≈çkoku Maru attacked them. The Japanese ships were each armed with eight 5.5-inch guns, while Ondina had only a 102 mm gun and Bengal a single 3-inch weapon. Both Allied ships scored hits in the H≈çkoku Maru which blew up and sank; the other raider escaped. Ondina was so damaged in the action that the captain ordered \\"abandon ship\\" after which he died. With the tanker's crew in lifeboats, the Japanese killed some with machine gun fire, rescued the majority of the crew of their sunken companion, and retired. Ondina did not sink, so its crew reboarded, repaired some of the damage, and reached port safely. === Postwar === Ondina was decommissioned and scrapped in 1959, at Hong Kong. == See also == * Japanese raiders in the Indian Ocean == References  Notes = Bibliography === * == External links == * Category:1939 ships Category:Oil tankers Category:Tankers of the Netherlands Category:World War II tankers Category:World War II merchant ships of the Netherlands Category:South-East Asian theatre of World War II Category:Battles of World War II involving Japan ","title":"MV Ondina"},{"id":"46851613","text":"John Breuilly (born 1946) is professor of nationalism and ethnicity at the London School of Economics.

Two sequels have been released. ==Gameplay== In Dungelot, the player must choose a character from the character selection menu. All the characters except one are locked and must be unlocked by reaching certain levels in the game. The chosen character will give the player a certain perk which can help the player in defeating each floor. Once the player has chosen a character and is in the game they must click on the tiles to show what's underneath it. The battle system is turn-based, which means after the player attacks, the enemy will attack and vice versa. The attack the player does is based on how much attack power they have. The default across the characters is between 1 and 3. To continue to the next floor the player must kill the enemy that is holding the key. The key will then unlock the door to the next level (which must also be found). When the player dies they must restart from floor one. ==Reception== The iOS version of Dungelot has a rating 83/100 on Metacritic based on 8 critic reviews. ==Legacy== There are two sequels; Dungelot 2 and Dungelot: Shattered Lands.

On 29 August 1945 Nielsen and 105 other victims of the occupation were given a state funeral in the memorial park founded at the execution and burial site in Ryvangen where he was executed. Bishop Hans Fuglsang-Damgaard led the service with participation from the royal family, the government and representatives of the resistance movement. The cemetery in R√∏dovre has a memorial plaque for him. == References == Category:1918 births Category:1945 deaths Category:Danish people of World War II Category:Danish resistance members Category:Danish people executed by Nazi Germany Category:Resistance members killed by Nazi Germany ","title":"Andreas Bronislaw Wadeksloff Nielsen"},{"id":"46852700","text":"Lady handing a coin to a Servant-Girl (c. 1668‚Äì72) is an oil on canvas painting by the Dutch painter Pieter de Hooch.

The most common subjects of depuration are such bivalves as oysters, clams, and mussels. ==History== Oysters in a depuration tank at a laboratory Most research and publications focus primarily on the depuration of seafood rather than freshwater animals. The commonly defined depuration process has been practiced since the 1800s originating as a method to prevent typhoid fever (via Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica, serovar Typhi) and other illnesses attributed to polluted shellfish being consumed.1\\\\. Belding and Lane 1909, A Report Upon the Mollusk Fisheries of Massachusetts. Wright & Potter, Boston As coastal seawater became increasingly contaminated with sewage-borne bacteria, early research investigated the use of disgorging tanks.2\\\\. Herdman and Boyce 1899, Oysters and disease. Lancashire Sea Fisheries Memoir No.1 London Today, modern seafood depuration is performed in segregated physical tanks using treated seawater that is sterilised either by way of chlorine, ultraviolet, or ozone. Seafood depuration is legislated or regulated in many countries, including the United States, EU members such as France, Ireland, and Italy, and Japan. Oversight is managed by internationally recognised agencies, for example, in the United States, the National Shellfish Sanitation Program (NSSP) administered by the Interstate Shellfish Sanitation Conference sets guidelines on depuration and is recognised by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. In Canada, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) and Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) actively compile the manual for the Canadian Shellfish Sanitation Program (CSSP). The Codex Alimentarius, which is overseen by the World Health Organization (WHO) and Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO), both recognises and encourages the application of seafood depuration.3\\\\. Code of Practice for fish and fishery products (first edition) Rome 2009. WHO and FAO According to the FAO in December 2006, France had 1422 depuration facilities, Italy had 144, Japan had over 1,000.4\\\\. Bivalve Depuration: fundamental and practical aspects. FAO Fisheries Technical paper. No 511. Rome FAO 2008. The long history of the depuration process which expands across many countries and is recognised by international agencies is contrasted by the scarce or nonexistent data in the commercial space of the seafood industry. In a majority formal research, publications and governmental regulations, depuration is approached in the form of \\"public protection\\" and not in the form of \\"public awareness\\". One research study attempts to link the benefits of consumer awareness of shellfish depuration and found that surveyed restaurants were reluctant to sell depurated seafood. Whereas in the same study, consumers surveyed indicated they were prepared to pay a premium for depurated oysters. However, the willingness to pay a premium was expressed after the consumer was informed about depuration and depurated seafood indicating the average consumer was unaware about the depuration process.5\\\\.

Standing three stories high, with the ground floor being flooded when the tide rose, the lord could swim into the sea through a gated doorway, preserving his dignity. The buildings also held a \\"hot-bath\\" room where seawater was heated and pumped in. The cove features in one of Agatha Christie‚Äôs novels, The ABC Murders, as the setting of Sir Carmichael Clarke‚Äôs untimely death. == References == Category:Beaches of Devon Category:Coves of England ","title":"Elberry Cove"},{"id":"46853138","text":"Nagadevampalayam is a panchayat village in Gobichettipalayam taluk in Erode District of Tamil Nadu state, India.

Ham Green Pottery was produced between 1100 AD to 1250 AD at a hamlet above the village of Pill called Ham Green in the English county of Somerset. ==History== The kiln was built of limestone lined with clay. It was long and wide and fired the clay which was thrown by hand. Two types of jugs have been identified. Type A, believed to date from the 12th century have a yellow splashed plain lead glaze and have a diamond pattern decorating the rim. Type B, a more recent product appears greener, due to the presence of copper in the glaze. The jugs were decorated with floral patterns sometimes with identifiable animals or human figures. Dendrochronology suggests that production had ceased by 1275. The site was excavated in 1959, when 6,915 fragments of pottery were uncovered, mainly decorated pieces of jugs and cooking pots. Further excavation took place in 1978. ==Trade== Pottery was exported via a port near the mouth of the River Avon at Pill all over Britain, in particular to South West England, South Wales and Ireland. This led to the name Crockerne Pill which means literally 'pottery wharf'. ==Artefacts== 'Ham Green' pottery has been found and identified in archaeological digs. An important archaeological 'dating tool' as the period of manufacture is so precise. Fragments found in excavations at Cheddar Palace were dated to 1200-1220.

Wild bottlenose dolphins are estimated to have a median lifespan between 8.3 and 17.4 years, while one bottlenose dolphin has been observed to live for at least 67 years. According to locals, Fungie was first seen in Dingle harbour in 1983, and continues to seek out human contact over thirty years later. Thus, Fungie is fully grown, and likely already in his middle or even old age. Fungie is known to interact playfully with swimmers, surfers, kayakers and divers in the water. There have not been any recorded cases of Fungie being aggressive towards humans. Although it is normal for social animals like dolphins to live in close contact with each other, it is still a rare occurrence for them to seek out human contact, and Fungie is the first recorded occurrence of a dolphin interacting positively with humans in the wild in Ireland. Fungie has been observed eating garfish, something not previously known to be eaten by dolphins.

Ltd. and trained by Noriyuki Hori. ==Racing career2014: two-year-old season=== Duramente began his racing career in a maiden race over 1800 metres at Tokyo Racecourse on 12 October and finished second of the eleven runners behind Love Your Man. In a similar race at the same course a month later he recorded his first victory, beating Shonen Harakasu and twelve others. ===2015: three-year-old season=== On his first appearance as a three-year-old, Duramente won the Saintpaulia Sho over 1800 metres at Tokyo on 1 February. Two weeks later over the same course and distance, the colt was moved up in class to contest the Grade 3 Kyodo News Service Hai. Ridden by Syu Ishibashi he started 4/5 favourite in a twelve-runner field but was beaten half a length by Sunday Racing's other runner Real Steel. Duramente wins the Toko Yushun On 19 April Duramente was ridden by Mirco Demuro when he was one of fifteen colts to contest the 75th running of the Grade 1 Satsuki Sho over 2000 metres at Nakayama Racecourse. The Italian Demuro had recently become one of the first two foreign jockeys (alongside Christophe Lemaire) to receive a full license from the Japan Racing Association. Duramente started 3.6/1 third choice in the betting behind Satono Crown (also trained by Noriyuki Hori) and Real Steel. After racing towards the rear of the field he made a forward move approaching the final turn but veered left, interfering with several other horses when Demuro moved him up to challenge entering the straight. In the closing stages the colt produced a strong burst of acceleration to take the lead 100 metres from the finish and won by one and a half lengths from Real Steel with Kitasan Black two and a half lengths back in third. Demuro, who received a suspension for causing interference said, \\"He was easy to ride early in the race but he's very highly strung, it was his first time going right-handed and the crowd was very loud too so he may have over-reacted at the fourth corner‚Äîhe gave me a bit of a fright\\". Six weeks after his win at Nakayama, Duramente started favourite for the 82nd Tokyo Yushun (Japanese Derby) over 2400 metres at Tokyo. After racing in eighth place he moved up as the field fanned wide on the final turn. He took the lead approaching the last 200 metres and won by one and three quarter lengths from Satono Rasen with Satono Crown in third. Duramente's winning time of 2:23.2 was a new race record, breaking the mark set by his sire King Kamehameha in 2004. Demuro commented \\"I‚Äôm so full of joy and gratitude to have been able to accomplish this with such a powerful and talented colt and especially as an official JRA jockey\\". In late June it was announced that Duramente had sustained \\"distal fractures\\" to both of his front legs and would be unable to race again for at least six months. He did not appear again in 2015. ===2016: four-year-old season=== Duramente returned after an absence of almost nine months in the Nakayama Kinen on 28 February. Starting the 11/10 favourite he took the lead on the outside on the final turn and held off a late challenge from Ambitious to win by a neck. He was then sent to the United Arab Emirates to contest the Dubai Sheema Classic on 26 March. He lost a shoe before the race and as it could not be replaced he competed in the race with three shoes. He finished second behind the British- trained five-year-old Postponed. The colt took a long time to recover from the race and did not reappear until 26 June when he was made the 1.9/1 favourite for the Takarazuka Kinen at Hanshin. He was restrained towards the rear of the seventeen runner field before being switched to the outside to deliver his run in the straight. Duramente made up a great deal of ground, passing horse after horse in the closing stages, but failed by a neck to catch the mare Marialite. The colt slipped crossing the finishing line sustaining serious injury to his left foreleg and a subsequent veterinary examination revealed extensive damage to his fetlock, pastern and tendons. Three days after the Takarazuka Kinen it was announced that Duramente was to be retired from racing and would stand as a breeding stallion at Northern Farm in 2017. Mirco Demuro commented \\"I'm shocked. Duramente's the strongest horse I've ever ridden\\". ==Assessment and awards== In the JRA Awards for 2015, Duramente was voted Best Three-Year-Old Colt taking 285 of the 291 votes. In the poll for Japanese Horse of the Year he finished third in the voting behind Maurice and Lovely Day. ==PedigreeReferences== Category:2012 racehorse births Category:Racehorses bred in Japan Category:Racehorses trained in Japan Category:Thoroughbred family 8-f ","title":"Duramente"},{"id":"46853513","text":"Pannota is a suborder of mayflies.

Other differences between the two groups include the morphology of the gills and also behavioural differences. Schistonota nymphs are mostly active swimmers, burrowers and sprawlers, while Pannota nymphs are more passive, slow-moving crawlers.

It is one of only two handmade globemaking companies in the world. ==History== Bellerby & Co's 'Churchill' globe being painted After a career in television, Peter Bellerby was running a music venue in London that included a bowling alley, when he started a search for a special globe for his father's 80th birthday. Not finding what he wanted, he set about making a globe himself by hand which led to the founding of the company in 2008. Two globes were commissioned for the 2011 film Hugo. In 2012, the company hosted the first globe exhibition at The Royal Geographical Society, and in the same year, an egg-shaped Bellerby globe was donated to The Faberge Big Egg Hunt charity for auction in London. The auction raised ¬£11,100 for the Elephant Family conservation movement. A second \\"egg\\" globe was auctioned at Sotheby's in New York in 2014 and raised $25,000, for both Elephant Family and Action for Children. The company has collaborated with British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare, for example on a \\"globe head\\" for his ballerina statue for the Royal Opera House. In 2017 the company made about 500 globes,https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/316101 including a commissioned globe that illustrates Royal Ascot's 300-year heritage.https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/ascot-racecourse-unveils-globe- mapping-its-horse-racing-history-a3480341.html In 2018 the company received a Queen's Award for Enterprise in the international trade category.http://queensawardsmagazine.com/award_year/2018/ It also took part in the Homo Faber exhibition,https://www.homofaberevent.com/en/experience- singular-talents collaborated with artist George Butler in an exhibition at the Bankside Gallery,https://www.londonlive.co.uk/news/2018-11-20/award- winning-war-illustrator and was commissioned by the family of Reinhold W√ºrth to create a Churchill Globe for his 83rd birthday.

The company employs two cartographers and uses a modern map of their own design that customers are invited to customise. The maps are printed onto paper gores and cut by hand. The paper is wet and stretched across the sphere before being hand painted and finished with a matte or gloss finish.https://www.theweek.co.uk/87020/peter-bellerby-bespoke- globes The globes are weighted so they come slowly to rest when spun. The wood and metal bases are made in the company's London studio. Their 80 series is made in connection with heritage technicians from Aston Martin.http://www.handfulofsalt.com/peter-bellerby-x-bellerby-co/ Some bases are mounted on ball bearings, others can be spun within hand-engraved solid brass meridians. The \\"Churchill Globe\\", at around fifty inches in diameter, is the largest made by the company. Its design is based on a Weber Costello, Chicago-made globe presented to Winston Churchill and Franklin Delano Roosevelt by George Marshall, the US Army's Chief of Staff during World War II. ==References== Category:Manufacturing companies based in London Category:British companies established in 2008 Category:Map companies of the United Kingdom Category:Luxury brands ","title":"Bellerby &amp; Co, Globemakers"},{"id":"46853596","text":"Music, Poetry and Madness (Spanish title:M√∫sico, poeta y loco) is a 1948 Mexican comedy film directed by Humberto G√≥mez Landero and starring Germ√°n Vald√©s, Marcelo Ch√°vez and Meche Barba.Hershfield & Maciel p.73 ==Cast== * Germ√°n Vald√©s as Tin Tan * Marcelo Ch√°vez as Marcelo * Meche Barba as Mercedes Miraflores * Beatriz Ramos as Consuelo Fern√°ndez * Conchita Gentil Arcos as Do√±a Altagracia * Maruja Grifell as Se√±orita directora * Natalia Gentil Arcos as Secretaria * Ernesto Finance as Don Maximiliano * Rafael Icardo as Don Esteban * Jes√∫s Gra√±a as Doctor Arsenio Mata Lozano * Humberto Rodr√≠guez as Jefe de polic√≠a * Hern√°n Vera as Don Apolonio * Luis Arcaraz * Gloria Lozano as Chica baila con Tin Tan * F√©lix Medel * Mar√≠a Luisa Smith as Espectadora de vendedores * Manuel 'Loco' Vald√©s as Transeunte == References  Bibliography == *Joanne Hershfield & David R.

His background is uncertain. His name may be an anglicisation of the Irish name O'Connell. In 1589 Connill was despatched by the Lord Deputy of Ireland William FitzWilliam with a force of Irish Army troops to the recently established County Donegal.Morgan p.122 This was part of the Tudor reform programme in Ireland which sought to bring the Gaelic areas under English law, thereby reducing levels of violence within them. Connill allegedly secured the position by bribing Fitzwilliam with two gold chains that had been recovered from the wreck of the Spanish Armada in Ireland.Morgan p.122 Connill's arrival coincided with a succession dispute amongst the O'Donnell dynasty to establish the next ruler of Tyrconnell, even while the current incumbent Sir Hugh Roe O'Donnell was still alive. Connill backed one of the candidates, Sir Donnell O'Donnell until his death at the Battle of Doire Leathan in 1590.Morgan p.130 Exploiting the chaos following Sir Donnell's death, Connill took control of much of western Donegal from his base at Donegal Abbey.Morgan p.130 Along with Humphrey Willis, the Sheriff of Donegal, Connill's men began raiding across Donegal, forcing the inhabitants to give them supplies and money. At one point Connill captured Sir Hugh O'Donnell, but he was freed by a cousin Niall Garve O'Donnell.Morgan p.123 In 1592 Hugh Roe O'Donnell returned from his imprisonment in Dublin Castle, and expelled Connill and Willis from Donegal.Morgan p.133 A criticism of Connill and Willis was that their conduct was similar to the activities of the Gaelic lords they were supposed to be preventing. The behavior of these forces may have been a factor in the subsequent outbreak of Tyrone's Rebellion in 1594. ==ReferencesBibliography== * Morgan, Hiram. Tyrone's Rebellion. Boydell Press, 1999.

It would be her first single to miss the UK Top 40, peaking at #52http://www.zobbel.de/cluk/CLUK_G.HTM spending just 3 weeks in the Top 200. The video featured Gina in a giant globe being watched over by a scientist. Following the release of this single, Gina entered a lengthy High Court legal battle against Steve Rodway of Motiv8 over royalties from Ooh Aah... Just A Little Bithttp://www.musicweek.com/news/read/gina-g-ex-label-boss-hit-by- legal-bill/025911 and against a contract with Rodway's company FX Musichttp://www.musicweek.com/news/read/gina-g-ex-label-boss-hit-by-legal- bill/025911 which had tied her into a binding contract resulting in her being unable to record musichttp://esctoday.com/67300/uk-interview-with-gina-g- part-1/ except for FX Music which according to Gina, since September 1997, had failed or refused to agree on tracks to be recorded for a second album \\"within a reasonable time or at all\\".https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/whos- suing-whom-eurovision-star-sues-record-label-over-contract- dispute-1182295.html Whilst Gina was ultimately successful, the time out of the music industry and the inability to capitalise on the success of the Fresh! album with a follow up damaged her career and it would be another nine years until she released another single. ===Track listings=== UK: CD Maxi (WEA0143CD) #Every Time I Fall (Radio Version) (4:01) #Every Time I Fall (Todd Terry Radio Mix) (3:26) #Every Time I Fall (Todd Terry's Pop Mix) 3:25 #Every Time I Fall (Metro's Eurobeat Mix) (5:46) #Every Time I Fall (Gina's Dub (Todd Terry Mix)) (7:36) Other versions: *Every Time I Fall (Gina's Acid Dub (Todd Terry Mix)) (7:15) - from the vinyl 12\\" release ==Tonight's The NightRelease=== Tonight's The Night was Gina's first single release in nine years following a long legal battle with her old producer that resulted in her losing her contract with Warner Music. This was not the first new track since the Fresh! album by Gina though. In 2003 she contributed two songs to the Re- born in the USA soundtrack following her appearance on the TV show of the same name, as well as recording an unreleased cover of These Boots Are Made For Walking and vocals for two tracks for an album by Soda Club. In 2004 she recorded vocals for a track entitled Heaven produced by Elemental which was released on promotional vinyl with new mixes of Ooh Aah... Just A Little Bit and in 2005 recorded a song called Flashback which was entered as a potential (yet ultimately unsuccessful) entry for the UK for the 2005 Eurovision Song Contest. Both Heaven and Flashback featured on a new album Get Up And Dance released independently through Gina's website in 2005 (one of the new remixes of Ooh Aah... Just A Little Bit also featured on the album. An ultimately unreleased version of Tonight's The Night was planned to be on Get Up And Dance but replaced at the last moment by a track called Into The Night. Instead the song was released by Gina's own label Stunt Girl Music and distributed by Universal in 2006. An initial set of remixes were commissioned though most of these were not commercially released. A bonus track Undone appeared on one of the CD releases. Despite promising club play, the song reached #57 in the charts, spending just one further week in the UK Top 200. Whilst a second single was planned, this never materialized. ===Track listings=== UK: CD Maxi #Tonight's The Night (Radio Edit) (3:31) #Tonight's The Night (Point 4 Extended 12\\" Remix) (6:06) #Tonight's The Night (Moto Blanco 12\\") (6:59) #Tonight's The Night (Klub Kids Klub Mix) (6:47) #Tonight's The Night (Moto Blanco Radio Edit) (3:17) #Tonight's The Night (Kuta Mix 12\\") (7:00) #Tonight's The Night (Moto Blanco Dub) (6:20) #Tonight's The Night (Video on CD Rom) UK: CD #Tonight's The Night (Radio Edit) (3:31) #Undone (3:37) Other versions: *Tonight's The Night (12\\" Original Mix) (6:29) *Tonight's The Night (12\\" Night Club Mix) (7:18) *Tonight's The Night (12\\" Latino Night Mix) (7:27) *Tonight's The Night (12\\" Night Club Dub) (7:26) *Tonight's The Night (7\\" Club Mix Edit) (3:29) *Tonight's The Night (7\\" Original Mix) (3:25) ==Next 2 YouRelease=== Next 2 You (originally titled 'Next 2 U') was the first and only single from a planned third album. The song originally appeared on Gina's Myspace pagehttp://www.popjustice.com/forum/threads/14148-Gina-G-New-EP-Coming-Soon in 2009 along with a track called Re-Invented and two versions of a track named Friday. These tracks were originally planned to be released as an EP but this never materialized. Instead Next 2 U was tweaked and released to iTunes in June 2011 and a video later appeared on YouTube. Both of these were later taken down with a new video and remix package for the UK market released in Autumn 2011. The new version featured British rapper Vigilante and a further new track Set The Night On Fire was performed at G-A-Y. The track ultimately failed to chart and despite other material recorded for a third album, nothing more was released, marking Next 2 You as Gina's last single release. ===Track listings=== UK: Digital Download #Next 2 You (Radio Edit) (4:00) #Next 2 You (Club Junkies Remix) (7:23) #Next 2 You (Mind Electric Club Mix) (6:27) #Next 2 You (Mind Electric Dub Mix) (5:55) Other versions: *Next 2 U (Original Version) (3:22) *Next 2 You (Peewee Ferris Club Mix) (7:41) *Next 2 You (Loud Manners Radio Edit) (3:42) *Next 2 You (Loud Manners Extended Mix) (6:45) ==References== G, Gina ","title":"Gina G singles discography"},{"id":"46853657","text":"Gr√©gory Berthier (born 11 November 1995) is a French professional footballer who plays as a winger for Danish 1st Division club Vendsyssel FF. ==Club career== Berthier made his professional debut with AJ Auxerre in August 2014, in a 1‚Äì0 Ligue 2 defeat against Dijon.

After this failed attempt, he took refuge in Spain. He returned to Portugal when a popular revolt grew against the anticlerical government of Costa Cabral, resulting in the 23 March 1846 Revolution of Maria da Fonte, which he joined. He placed himself at the orders of General S√° da Bandeira. For his bravery in action he was awarded a knight of the Order of the Tower and Sword. However his faction lost, he collected debts of taxes he could not pay, and was expelled from the army. Soon after he became a notorious bandit. He was eventually captured in 31 March 1859, and presented to court in Porto 9 December 1859. He was sentenced to exile to the Portuguese colony of Angola where he lived for the remainder of his life. He is regarded as a Portuguese equivalent of Robin Hood.Stead, Rorison & Scafidi p.296 ==Popular culture== Z√© do Telhado's exploits rapidly became part of Portuguese folklore and have been an inspiration for a number of plays and novels.

Mr. Robert Norman Bland, B.A. A son of Major-General Bland, R.E., he was born at Malta in 1859. He was educated at Cheltenham College and at Trinity College, Dublin, where he obtained the degree of B.A. in 1882. Mr. Bland has had a long and varied career in the Straits Settlements Civil Service. Arriving in the colony early in 1883, he was attached to the Colonial Secretary's Office as a cadet learning Chinese, and in the following year he also qualified in Malay. He has served as private secretary to the Acting Governor, Collector and Magistrate at Kuala Pilah in the Negri Sambilan, Assistant Resident Councillor at Pinang, Collector of Land Revenue at Pinang and Singapore, officer in charge of Sungei Ujong, Inspector of Prisons for the Straits Settlements, Colonial Treasurer and Collector of Stamp Duties, and Resident Councillor at Malacca. In 1887 he was engaged in reporting upon a system of Mukim boundaries in Pinang and Province Wellesley. He is ex-officio Chairman of the Pinang Committee of the Tanjong Pagar Board, of the District Hospital, of the Library, and of the Gardens Committee, Pinang; a trustee of St. George's Church and of St. George's Girls' School ; and president of the Free School's Committee. Mr. Bland raised and commanded a company of volunteers in Malacca.(1902-6). He is a member of the Colonial Institute and of the Sports Club, London, and is enrolled either as a patron or member of all the local clubs. His recreations are golf and riding. He married, in 1895, Laura Emily, eldest daughter of the late Mr. Thomas Shelford, C.M.G., head of the firm of Paterson, Simons Co., and for some twenty years member of the Legislative Council of the Straits Settlements. Mrs. Bland is a member of the Straits branch of the Royal Asiatic Society and of the Royal Anthropological Institute. She takes a keen interest in women's work amongst the Malays.\\" \\"Mr. R. N. Bland, C.M.G. Mr. Robert Norman Bland was appointed a Cadet in the Straits service in 1882. He held various offices in the three Settlements, and was also in charge of Sungei Ujong and Jelebu from 1893 to 1895. He became Colonial Treasurer in 1904, and was successively Resident Councillor, Malacca, from 1904 to 1907, and of Penang from 1907 to 1910, when he retired. He became a C.M.G. in the latter year. He is the author of the illustrated work Historical Tombstones of Malacca, which has done much to preserve the records of monuments of the past, otherwise only too likely to perish, and he was a frequent contributor to the Royal Asiatic Society's Journal.\\" The sometimes contradictory accounts of the dates or periods he held these positions for, is due to two practices at that time. Firstly, holding multiple positions at the same time (a substantive role, together with other less substantive, temporary or acting roles). And second, being appointed to a role (substantive) but not functioning in that role, while someone else acts in that role or performs that function temporarily. These practices can be seen from the details provided below in the accounts of his appointments in the Straits Settlements and F.M.S. civil service.

Sir Frank Athelstane Swettenham was among the first Cadets to arrive at the Straits under this system which continued as it was until 1882. Swettenham's contemporaries, also arriving under this system included James Kortright Birch, Charles Walter Sneyd-Kynnersley, Arthur Philip Talbot, Henry Arthur O'Brien, Edward Charles Hepworth Hill, Frederick Gordon Penney, Edward Marsh Merewether, and Walter Egerton. Ernest Woodford Birch also came out at this time but was excused the Cadet Examinnations, having been previously employed at the Colonial Office for some time. John Wodehouse, 1st Earl of Kimberley served as Secretary of State for the Colonies twice, the first from 6 July 1870 to 17 February 1874 and then again 21 April 1880 to 16 December 1882. During the latter period open competition for entry to the service of the Straits Settlements, Hong Kong and Ceylon, was started. Those who were successful were allowed to choose among the available vacancies in these three places. They had to pass through the qualifying and then the advanced examination. It was under this system that Robert Norman Bland, William Evans, Reginald George Watson, Arthur Warren Swete O'Sullivan, James Oliver Anthonisz, George Thompson Hare, Edward Lewis Brockman, and John Robert Innes entered the service of the Straits Settlements' Colonial Administration.[Nunn 1911: 120-121] Bland had prepared for his Eastern Cadetship Examination with the help of the Wren and Gurney College.

While serving as Magistrate at Penang, in 1887, Bland was deputed, during the re-survey of Penang and Province Wellesley, to divide the areas of Province Wellesley to be surveyed, into Mukims. It was at this time that the term Mukim came into use in the Straits Settlements.The Straits Times [Singapore] 19 May 1951: 6. Print. He was appointed Collector of Land Revenue at Penang in 1889.

Print. === Straits Settlements Postal Service === In April 1886, Dudley Francis Amelius Hervey, Resident Councillor of Malacca, left for Europe on home leave. This created the need to fill his seat on the Legislative Council among the Official Members and gave rise to a reshuffle in the S.S. Civil Service. Edwin Empson Isemonger, who sat on the Council as Acting Colonial Treasurer, moved to Malacca as Acting Resident Councillor; Richard Spear O'Connor, then Senior Magistrate, took Isemonger's place as Acting Colonial Treasurer; Henry Arthur O'Brien, Magistrate at Malacca and Acting British Resident at Sungei Ujong, to act as Senior Magistrate; Edward Marsh Merewether, Collector of Land Revenue and newly appointed Magistrate at Singapore, to act as Magistrate in Malacca; and Hancock Thomas Haughton, newly appointed Acting Superintendent of Police, Licensing Officer (Excise and Gunpowder Ordinances and Act), Deputy Registrar (Contagious Diseases Ordinance) and Coroner at Malacca, to act for Merewether.Straits Times Weekly Issue [Singapore] 27 Mar1886: 2. Print. A similar sort of shuffling had led to Bland's appointment as Acting Assistant Postmaster-General. The position of Assistant Postmaster-General had been held by Noel Trotter who was formerly Postmaster-General at Penang, a post that was subsequently downgraded to Assistant Postmaster-General, who also, at that time, having moved to Singapore for the purpose, was Acting Postmaster- General. Trotter had acted in that role several times in the past for Isemonger who also held the position of Postmaster-General. In July 1887, Hervey returned, Isemonger resumed his position of Postmaster-General and Trotter moved pack to Penang from Singapore, to once again continue as Assistant Postmaster-general there.Straits Times Overland Journal [Singapore] 20 Apr. 1880: 12; The Straits Times [Singapore] 20 Mar. 1883: 2.

Print. By the middle of September the Commission were in Malacca enquiring and reporting on the workings of the Malay schools in that Settlement.The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser (1884-1942) 14 Sep. 1893: 2. === Royalist and patriot === Bland had established the League of the Empire, devoted to bringing all the units of Overseas Great Britain into touch, mainly by the observance of Empire day in schools, at Malacca. Upon its inauguration there a Chinese Malaccan Ong Kim Wee founded a fund to provide an annual prize on Empire Day, to be competed for by the English-speaking boys of Malacca. The $600 he gave to this, would produce about $40 a year to be used for the purchase of prizes that the elder boys could compete for. A newspaper reporting on that in September 19006, also noted that Bland, unlike the heads of government at the other two Settlements was not someone to be admired from a distance but had personal relationships with many of the local community who view him as their head.The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser (1884-1942) 27 Sep. 1906: 4.

In May 1907 Bland offered Penang Free School students a $25 prize for the best pupils passing the examination in the history of the British Empire.Eastern Daily Mail and Straits Morning Advertiser [Singapore] 11 May 1907: 2.

In 1907 the local populace were treated to a parade by the Cadet Corps of the Penang Free School at the Esplanade.\\"Empire Day at Penang and Kuala Lumpur.\\" The Straits Times [Singapore] 27 May 1907: 7.

He had done this without carefully observing the law that provided for no slaughter unless first examined by a qualified veterinary surgeon and pronounced to be infected with rinderpest. In November that year, the Legislative Council, without any dissenting voices, voted $1,005 to compensate owners of the animals slaughtered by Bland.\\"LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL.

May and Captain Stockley, accompanied Governor Sir John Anderson G.C.M.G. on an inspection of \\"Prai and the northern district of Province Wellesley, motoring up to Permatang and Bindabari, on the Kedah frontier, where the party crossed the Muda River to Kota, the principal township of Kuala Muda, in the district of Kedah.\\" Having inspected the courthouse, general hospital and police station, they returned to Penang on 6 January, along the same route.

G. May, Colonial Surgeon Thomas Crichton Mugliston, and Superintendent of Works Norman Wilkinson (Wilkie) to inspect the site of the proposed quarantine camp for the Colony and the Federated Malay States, and a new temporary shed, after which they went over to the Leper Asylum to choose a site for a new leper ward.Eastern Daily Mail and Straits Morning Advertiser [Singapore] 6 Jul. 1907: 2. Print. In September 1907 there was an outbreak of cholera and smallpox aboard the British India steamer Teesta, bringing in 3,700 Indian Coolies bound for, among other situations, the many plantations on the Peninsula. About 2,500 of them were landed at Pulau Jerejak, the remaining 1,200 or so, meant for disembarkation at Port Swettenham were taken to St. John's Island. This new influx, bringing the total there to over 3,000 inmates, strained the resources of Pulau Jerejak to near breaking point. The Agricultural Coolies, imported by the Malay Peninsula Agricultural Society, housed in wooden sheds, fed and slept on wooden benches, a situation considered to give rise to the harbouring of germs and the spread of infection.\\"Quarantine Accommodation.\\" The Straits Times [Singapore] 13 Sep. 1907: 7. Print. Bland had had to draw 50 of George Town's Sikh Police to stand guard duty at Pulau Jerejak.The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser (1884-1942) 20 Sep. 1907: 5. Print. By 17 September things had improved, a total of 900 under detention being released over the 16th and 17th, and it was being proposed to take in 500 passengers from the British India steamer Thongwa, the remainder of the Thongwa's 3,000 passengers to be sent to S. John's Island, Singapore.The Straits Times [Singapore] 19 Sep. 1907: 7. Print. In late February, after nineteen deaths had occurred during its voyage, the Blue Funnel steamer Idomeneus bringing 859 pilgrims from Jeddah, arrived at Penang. 24 pilgrims, including 7 with smallpox, were landed at Pulau Jerejak, the remaining pilgrims proceeding to quarantine at St. John's Island, Singapore.The Straits Times [Singapore] 28 Feb. 1908: 6. In late March 1908 the British India steamer Thongwa, from the Coromandel Coast was ordered to remain outside the Penang Harbour limits. Cholera had broken out and two had died during the voyage. The remaining 862 ordinary passengers and 744 immigrants were quarantined at Pulau Jerejak.The Straits Times [Singapore] 23 Mar. 1908: 6. Print. In May 1908 Superintendent of Immigrants, Lewis Hare Clayton, paid a report on Indian Immigration for 1907 before the Legislative Council. The figures argued for an increase in the capacity that could be managed at Pulau Jerejak. 60,547 immigrants had arrived in Penang from Southern India in 1907, the highest number ever recorded. Clayton's reported noted that the accommodation at Pulau Jerejak had been considerably extended in 1907 to handle up to 3,500 inmates, and that a new and improved quarantine camp, in course of construction on the western side of the island, was expected to be completed before the end of 1908.\\"Indian Immigration\\". The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser (1884-1942) 2 May 1908: 7. Print. Apparently this was insufficient. On 24 June Bland called for tenders, to be received at the Resident Councillor's Office by noon 12 September 1908 for supply and erection of steelwork for thirty-two corrugated iron buildings at Pulau Jerejak.The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser (1884-1942) 31 Jul. 1908: 2. Print. The work took much longer than first estimated. In the first week of January 1910, just a few months before he retired and left the Colony, Bland escorted Governor John Anderson on an inspection of the work in progress there.\\"GOVERNOR ON INSPECTION DUTY.\\" The Straits Times [Singapore] 7 Jan. 1910: 7. Print. On 24 August, Bland received a deputation from the Penang Chinese Chamber of Commerce, comprising Leong Lok Hing, J.P. (Chairman), Lim Hua Cheam, J.P. Lim Eu Toh, Goh Taik Chee, and Yeoh Guan Seok, who wished to address the Resident Councillor on the regulations for the quarantine of passengers. Also in attendance at that meeting were, Dr. Sidney Herbert Reginald Lucy, Acting Senior Medical Officer, Penang, Dr. George Williamson Park, Municipal Health Officer, and Mr. David Beatty, Acting Assistant Protector of Chinese, were in attendance. The Chamber desired the Government to allow any member from an imported port to land provided he produces a certificate of membership, with his photograph affixed; and that its members may be allowed to stand security for the daily appearance of any passenger before the Municipal Health Officer. In both cases, the member guaranteeing his own or any one else's appearance will pay a penalty of $100 in default. The deputation had been appointed to explain to the Resident Councillor the Chamber's request that its certificate of membership should be recognised as a sufficient guarantee to permit of the landing of a passenger from an infected port. Bland requested the deputation to supply further particulars concerning the constitution of the Chamber before giving his reply. They were not heard from again.The Straits Times [Singapore] 26 Aug 1908: 7. Print: The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser (1884-1942) 28 Aug. 1908: 2. Print. The work seemed to get bigger and bigger. On 18 September 1908, the Colonial Secretary called for tenders for the erection of a reinforced concrete jetty for the new quarantine camp at Kampong Panchor, Pulau Jerejak.The Straits Times [Singapore] 21 Sep. 1908: 12. Print. In his 1910 Budget speech, on 1 October 1909, Governor Sir John Anderson noted that progress had been made with the new quarantine camp at Pulau Jerejak and that it was expected to be finished at the end of 1910.The Straits Times [Singapore] 1 Oct. 1909: 7. Print. It was not. In April 1911, a year after Bland had left, the new quarantine camp at Pulau Jerejak was opened, quietly, without ceremony. It was finally completed at a cost of $500,000.\\"CAMP AT PULAU JEREJAK.\\" The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser (1884-1942) 10 Apr. 1911: 4.

Bland immediately sent Alfred Martin White, Government Veterinary Inspector, across the hills to investigate. White, whose diagnosis was later confirmed by a pathological examination by Government Veterinary Surgeon, William Henry MacArthur, who identified the bacteria as being the Trypanswomes.\\"SURRA IN BALIK PULAU. Penang Gazette\\" The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser (1884-1942) 4 Jun. 1907: 5. Print. On 3 June Bland visited Balik Pulau himself, together with MacArthur. He determined that stringent measures and every precaution must be taken to check the spread of the disease. It was fortunate that the whole district of Balik Pulau, being isolated from George Town by the intervening hill ranges, was suitable for the purposes of quarantine. A few days later Bland had issued an order prohibiting the export of equines, other than bona fide race-horses, from Penang,The Straits Times, 8 Jun. 1907: 6. Print. except under a certificate from the Government Veterinary Surgeon, McArthur.The Straits Times [Singapore], 13 Jul. 1907: 6. Print. == Moments in Malayan history  Penang fishermen's dispute === In March 1907 Acting Resident Councillor Bland visited the Siamese Western Malay States. Upon his return to Penang he proceeded immediately to Gertak Sanggul at the southern part of Penang Island to settle a dispute among the Chinese villagers there. Some fishermen had cut down several coconut trees on Crown Land leased to one Chinese there in order to clear more space for their nets. After receiving a warning from the relevant District Officer they made an appeal to Bland who determined that more space was needed and therefore allowed for the fishermen.The Straits Times [Singapore], 15 Mar. 1907: 7. Print. === Penang's sampan-men dispute === In 1908, the sampan-men of Penang harbour went on strike. Looking in on the situation, Bland determined the need for a broader and deeper investigation into the complaints of the sampan-men, and the public who complained about their unusual charges. In December 1908, the Government acted on Bland's suggestion and a Committee comprising Judge L. E. P. Wolferstan (Chairman), Harbour Master Commander D. C. MacIntyre R.N.R., and Assistant Protector of Chinese David Beatty was appointed to enquire into the complaints of the sampan men of Penang.The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser (1884-1942) 11 Dec. 1908: 4. Print. The cause of the strike was, according to the complainants, due to the prohibition of careening and repairing on Weld Quay, and inadequate fares. Launches from the Government Wharves, the Prye Dock and elsewhere, carried on passenger traffic and assisted in loading and discharging cargo.\\"Penang Sampans. A Serious Strike. Launches to the Rescue.\\" The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser (1884-1942) 11 Dec. 1908: 4. Print. This strike was carried on by sampan-men of all ethnicities. The sampan-men had earlier on been fined heavily for insisting that passengers pay more than the two cents per passenger each way to and from steamers within the inner harbour and four cents to vessels in the outer harbour set down in the Harbour Rules for Sampans. While some viewed this as extortion there were cases mentioned where passengers gave more than the rules called for, of their own accord. The case where a passenger gave 30 cents and the sampan-man was fined $20 is said to have led to the leaders of the sampan-men initiating the strike. The sampan- men found the prohibition on repairing their boats along Weld Quay a hardship and the fares dictated by the Harbour Rules inadequate. The prohibition, apparently came about because of complaints from tongkang-men who were unable to get near to Weld Quay, being obstructed by sampans laid up for repair. The strike was said to have involved 150 sampans.\\"Penang Sampan Strike.\\" The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser (1884-1942) 16 Nov. 1908: 5. Print. According to reports, on 2 November from thirty to forty sampan-men entered the house of the contractor who supplies the Harbour Department with fuel for launches, and threatened to maim him if he refused to join their cause by stopping supplies. The contractor told them he would not have anything to do with them, and, fearing an attack, collected in all of his coolies, although the sampan-men did not reappear. On 13 November Lim Eow Thong and Goh Taik Chee introduced a deputation of sampan-men to Assistant Protector of Chinese Beatty, whereupon the sampan-men related the hardship brought about by the prohibition on repairs along Weld Quay, and of the inadequacy of the present fare structure. Beaty said he would lay these complaints before Bland. Following that a meeting took place at Bland's office. In addition to the Chinese sampan-men who talked to Beatty, leaders of the Malay and Indian sampan-men approached Major H. Barry de Hamel, the Chief Police Officer, and L. H. Clayton, the Superintendent of Indian Immigration. The Government refused to do anything unless the sampan-men called off their strike.The Straits Times [Singapore] 17 Nov. 1908: 8. Print. The strike ended and the men went back to work on the 14th.\\"Penang Sampan Strike.\\" The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser (1884-1942) 17 Nov. 1908: 8. Print.

Assembled there at the opening of the new $80,000 Mandarin-medium school were the principal members of the ethnic-Chinese community of Penang.\\"Notes from Penang. Philantrophy of Former Singapore Consul.\\" The Straits Times [Singapore] 11 Feb. 1909: 7. Print; \\"Penang Mandarin School.\\" The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser (1884-1942) 13 Feb. 1909: 3. Print. Beginning his address, Bland said, \\"Mr. Thio Tiau Siat was responsible for the building of the new school, at a cost of about $65,000. The site cost $15,000, exclusive of the portion given by the Hok Tek Cheng Sin Kongsi, and the building just opened cost $50,000.\\" Thio Tiau Siat, or Cheong Fatt Tze as he is known by some today, was a Guandong- born Hakka, a Sumatran planter and businessman, Commissioner of Railways for Swatow and Director of the Canton-Hankow Railway, Sole-Proprietor of the Ban Joo Hin line of steamships at Penang, and Chinese Consul-General for Singapore and Vice-Consul for Penang. In 1905, Thio, together with Foo Choo Choon and three others, each subscribed $5,000 towards the inauguration of a Mandarin- medium school in Penang, the classes at that time being conducted at a room inside the Penang Chinese Town Hall, the cost of classes at $500 a month being defrayed by Thio. Eventually, a suitable site was identified and secured and a building erected. The new school, situated at Maxwell Road next to the Anglo- Chinese School there, by that time already had a population of 100 pupils and 4 teachers. Bland noted that it was fitting to have a Mandarin-medium school given that three-fourths of the population of China spoke Mandarin, three- fourths of the population of the Straits Settlements were ethnically Chinese, and that whether Straits-born or China-born, all of them should have the opportunity of learning Mandarin. He commended a knowledge of Chinese Classics to those students in the Colony and trusted that, should they return to China, they would take with them the idea of freedom as imparted to them in that British Colony of the Straits Settlements. Yeoh Guan Seok, on behalf of the principal ethnic-Chinese members present, thanked Resident Councillor Bland and took the opportunity to dispel a misleading rumour. The establishment of the new institution, he said, had no political intent. There were many ethnic- Chinese in Penang who were naturally interested in the place of their ancestral origins, including its politics, but enjoyed the peace and prosperity they experienced under British governance, also taking a keen interest in the activities and achievements of the British government, so ably represented by Bland. The objects of the new school, Yeoh said, were simply to provide pupils a knowledge of Chinese literature and people, with a view to intellectual development and to help prepare them for careers in business. === Malacca's Victoria Memorial Fountain === On 24 May 1905, Acting Resident Councillor Bland officiated at the unveiling of Malacca's Victoria Memorial Fountain. In his address to the assembled, Bland noted that Malacca owed their memorial largely to the action and efforts of the late Lee Keng Liat and other Chinese gentlemen associated with him. \\"In 1902 the Committee of the Memorial Fund Singapore had invited Malacca to join them in the erection of a Town Hall in Singapore. A meeting was held in Malacca to discuss this, and on behalf of the Chinese Lee Keng Liat expressed a desire to erect instead some local memorial, and stated that some $1,500 had already been subscribed for that purpose. The meeting upon this decided that a fountain should be erected in front of the Stadt House and designs were called for. The designs submitted locally were not generally approved, and subsequently, Messrs Doulton of London were asked to submit one. They did so and their design with some few alterations was accepted, and had resulted in this graceful memorial, which had been erected at a cost of about $5,000..\\" Bland said that thanks were due to the late Lee Keng Liat and also to C. Garrard (Secretary of the Committee), Doulton of London, and Superintendent of Works Lupton who had supervised the project.\\"Empire Day at Malacca.\\" The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser (1884-1942) 27 May 1905: 5. Print. === Malacca's Jubilee Tablet === Acting Resident Councillor Bland officiated at the unveiling of a tablet commemorating the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria at Malacca on 2 July 1900. $2,000 had been contributed by the local population to which Government had added $1,500 making a total of $3,000. From its proceeds a scholarship had been established to be won by the best boy in the seventh standard, which was won in its first year by Sit Peng Lock who held it for a year and was at this date pursuing this studies at the Madras Medical College, and in the second year by A. J. Minjoot who was, at that time, doing well in his studies at Malacca.\\"Malacca.\\" The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser (1884-1942) 3 Jul. 1900: 2.

Railway was declared open, Acting Resident Councillor Bland having arrived at 6.30 a.m. at Kubu Station where he met R. C. Fryer, Firmstone, Lupton and Darbishire (the constructing engineer), after which they proceeded to Tampin, arriving there at 7.40. With the extension of rail services to Malacca, it was now possible to leave there at 1 p.m. and arrive at Penang at 6.21 a.m. the following day, instead of taking two or three days by steamer. The project had pushed ahead with speed. The first sod was cut on 9 June 1901 and plate laying commenced October 1904. Malacca's first engine was put together at the Malacca Yard, and steam was got up on 9 November 1904.

He does his own colour processing in his bedroom[...]. He has referred to a 'certain morbidity' in his work. Well, that is an element of life too. The young ballerinas seem to be under a spell, in thrall. At one and the same time he is tender artist and tyrant. The delicacy and control of colour in these shades will excite wonderment and pleasure, where a hint of coral light imbues the lobe of an ear, or minuscule catchlight alights with barest touch on the tip of eyelashes or edges the profiled iris of her eye. At times he teases with only a suggestion of vaporous form, but the presence breathes within the frame. Do we not grieve for mortality when we perceive (for there is a tactile as well as a visual understanding here) the wisp of hair on the nape of her neck? There is something in the order of mystery.

Nine minutes later Thai play-maker Chanathip Songkrasin found Pinyo Inpinit with a fine reverse-pass which the latter put on a plate for Chananan Pombuppha, who couldn't miss. Seven minutes before half time Peerapat broke down the flank and his cross was powerfully dispatched by Nurul Sriyankem. Just a minute after the break Peerapat claimed his third assist of the game as his corner was headed in by Chananan. At the hour mark Nurul was adjudged to have been fouled by Sengdao Inthilath in the box and Chananan confidently scored the penalty kick to complete his hat-trick. The sixth Thai goal came through some lovely interplay between the substitutes ended with Tristan Do floating a fine cross over the Laotian goalkeeper and left Chananan with the task of heading into the empty net for his fourth goal of the game. To their credit Laos never gave up and had too great chances, one in the 35 minute when Thai goaltender Chanin Sae-Eae had to pull off a diving save to keep out Soukaphone Vongchiengkham's effort, and in the 51 when substitute Maitee's shot went just over. { width=\\"100%\\" valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"50%\\" { style=\\"font-size: 90%\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" - !width=\\"25\\" !!width=\\"25\\" -  GK  1 Vathana Keodouangdeth -  DF  13 Bounthavy Sipasong -  DF  12 Thenthong Phonsettha   -  DF  19 Sengdao Inthilath  -  DF  14 Soukchinda Natphasouk -  MF  21 Tiny Bounmalay (c) -  MF  15 Phoutthasay Khochalern -  MF  8 Keoviengphet Liththideth   -  MF  10 Soukaphone Vongchiengkham   -  MF  7 Khonesavanh Sihavong -  FW  2 Thinnakone Vongsa - colspan=3Substitutions: -  MF  11 Maitee Maitee   -  FW  9 Sitthideth Khanthavong   -  FW  16 Sinnalone Sihalath   - colspan=3Coach: - colspan=3 Dave Booth } valign=\\"top\\" valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"50%\\" { style=\\"font-size: 90%\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" align=\\"center\\" - !width=25 !!width=25 -  GK  1 Chanin Sae-Eae -  DF  5 Adisorn Promrak -  DF  2 Peerapat Notechaiya -  DF  8 Artit Daosawang -  DF  13 Narubadin Weerawatnodom   -  MF  12 Nurul Sriyankem   -  MF  6 Sarach Yooyen (c) -  MF  7 Thitipan Puangchan -  MF  18 Chanathip Songkrasin -  MF  11 Pinyo Inpinit   -  FW  23 Chananan Pombuppha - colspan=3Substitutions: -  MF  14 Pakorn Prempak   -  DF  19 Tristan Do   -  MF  29 Rungrath Poomchantuek   - colspan=3Coach: - colspan=3 Choketawee Promrut } } { width=50% style=\\"font-size: 90%\\"  Assistant referees: Mohammad Reza Mansouriri (Iran) Ahmed Ferdous (Bangladesh) Fourth official: Sukhbir Singh (Singapore) } ==Malaysia vs Timor-Leste== Malaysia took the lead in only the eleventh minute as Nurridzuan Abu Hassan cross was missed by several players although it fell to midfielder D. Saarvindran who effortlessly scored. Muhammad Syafiq Ahmad had a great opportunity to double the lead three minutes later when a defensive slip up let him through on goal although his shot was deflected for a corner. Thirteen minutes before half time Malaysian midfielder Nazmi Faiz Mansor was shown a straight red card for allegedly spitting at an opponent in an off the ball situation. Chances were few and far between in the second half as 10 man Malaysia were hesitant to take chances and Timor-Leste could not break through their defence. In the seventy third minute the two Malaysian substitutes combined well, with Nazirul Naim Che Hashim's corner being headed against the bar by S. Kumaahran. Timor-Leste's best chance came five minutes from time as Mohd Farhan Abu Bakar had to dive at full stretch to make a superb save from captain Anggisu's free kick. { width=\\"100%\\" valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"50%\\" { style=\\"font-size: 90%\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" - !width=\\"25\\" !!width=\\"25\\" -  GK  1 Mohd Farhan Abu Bakar -  DF  29 Matthew Davies -  DF  26 Mohd Amer Saidin -  DF  25 Adam Nor Azlin -  DF  17 Mohd Fandi Othman (c) -  MF  12 Gary Steven Robbat   -  MF  16 Nurridzuan Abu Hassan   -  MF  28 Mohd Amirul Hisyam Awang Kechik -  MF  6 D.

In only the eleventh minute when the former found Phoutthasay Khochalern outside the box who unleashed a well place shot to score the first goal of the game. Despite the early dominance by Laos, Brunei grew into the game and had several good opportunities fall to their captain and former Arsenal and Chelsea academy player Faiq Jefri Bolkiah. In the 19th minute he dribbled past two defenders to see his shot go just wide, while three minutes later the Laotian goalkeeper had to be alert to his well placed free-kick. Faiq Jefri was desperately unlucky in the 32nd minute when his fine run and shot had Soukthavy Soundala beaten but his effort rebounded off the post. It was Laos' turn to hit the word work ten minutes later with Sihavong and Soukaphone coming well again but the former's effort coming back of the underside of the crossbar. In the 55th minute Bruneian goalkeeper Ahsanuddin had to make a fantastic one handed save from Phoutthasay's long range effort, and again ten minutes later from Khouanta Sivongthong. Brunei finally got their equaliser in the 67th minute when a quick counterattack ended with Azwan Ali Rahman placing a shot into the top corner. Parity would only last seven minutes though as Soukchinda Natphasouk got behind the Bruneian defence to turn in Soukaphone's low cross. The Laotians held on for the win in a fine match. { width=\\"100%\\" valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"50%\\" { style=\\"font-size: 90%\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" - !width=\\"25\\" !!width=\\"25\\" -  GK  1 Md Ahsanuddin Hj Md Dani -  DF  4 Md Khairil Shahme Suhaimi  -  DF  5 Suhaimi Anak Sulau -  DF  22 Azri Zahari -  DF  24 Mohd Hanif Hamir -  MF  3 Mohd Asnawi Syazni Aziz -  MF  10 Muhammad Nur Ikhmal Damit -  MF  11 Md Aminuddin Zakwan Tahir -  MF  20 Muhd Saiful Ammar Hj Adis   -  MF  27 Azwan Ali Rahman -  FW  9 Faiq Jefri Bolkiah (c) - colspan=3Substitutions: -  FW  21 Mohd Shafie Hj Mohd Effendy   - colspan=3Coach: - colspan=3 Stephen Ng Heng Seng } valign=\\"top\\" valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"50%\\" { style=\\"font-size: 90%\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" align=\\"center\\" - !width=25 !!width=25 -  GK  18 Soukthavy Soundala -  DF  12 Thenthong Phonsettha -  DF  19 Sengdao Inthilath -  DF  14 Soukchinda Natphasouk   -  MF  21 Tiny Bounmalay (c) -  MF  15 Phoutthasay Khochalern   -  MF  17 Vilayout Sayyabounsou -  MF  11 Maitee Maitee  -  MF  10 Soukaphone Vongchiengkham -  MF  7 Khonesavanh Sihavong   -  FW  2 Thinnakone Vongsa - colspan=3Substitutions: -  DF  20 Khouanta Sivongthong   -  MF  26 Lembo Saysana   -  FW  23 Xaisongkham Champathong   - colspan=3Coach: - colspan=3 Dave Booth } } { width=50% style=\\"font-size: 90%\\"  Assistant referees: Saparmammet Gurbanov (Turkmenistan) Ahmed Ferdous (Bangladesh) Fourth official: Foo Chuan Hui (Singapore) } ==Thailand vs Timor-Leste== A surprisingly resolute Timorese side managed to stem a Thai attack that had scored six in the previous game. Thailand should have taken the lead in the 41st minute when Sarach Yooyen's free-kick was parried by Ramos Maxanches, but only a few yards out with no pressure and the whole goal to aim at Nurul Sriyankem some how managed to blast his shot way over. Thailand finally were able to capitalise on their vast dominance a minute before half-time as Chanathip Songkrasin's decisive pass was composedly finished by Rungrath Poomchantuek. In the second half Thailand had a great opportunity to double their lead when they were awarded a penalty kick after Nurul was tripped in the box in the 54th minute. Chananan Pombuppha had scored four in his previous game and was given the responsibility but Maxanches dove low to his right to save the shot. Timor- Leste defended well but offered little in attack as Thailand won by the single goal. { width=\\"100%\\" valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"50%\\" { style=\\"font-size: 90%\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" - !width=\\"25\\" !!width=\\"25\\" -  GK  1 Chanin Sae-Eae -  DF  2 Peerapat Notechaiya   -  DF  8 Artit Daosawang -  DF  13 Narubadin Weerawatnodom -  DF  17 Tanaboon Kesarat -  MF  12 Nurul Sriyankem  -  MF  6 Sarach Yooyen (c) -  MF  29 Rungrath Poomchantuek -  MF  7 Thitipan Puangchan   -  MF  18 Chanathip Songkrasin -  FW  23 Chananan Pombuppha   - colspan=3Substitutions: -  DF  3 Suriya Singmui   -  FW  22 Chenrop Samphaodi   -  MF  4 Chaowat Veerachat   - colspan=3Coach: - colspan=3 Choketawee Promrut } valign=\\"top\\" valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"50%\\" { style=\\"font-size: 90%\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" align=\\"center\\" - !width=25 !!width=25 -  GK  12 Ramos Maxanches -  DF  2 Ezequiel Fernandes -  DF  4 Filipe Oliveira -  DF  15 Agostinho -  DF  18 Candido Oliveira -  MF  11 Nataniel Reis -  MF  10 Nilo Soares   -  FW  5 Henrique Cruz   -  FW  6 Anggisu Barbosa (c) -  FW  19 Feliciano Goncalves  -  FW  9 Jairo Neto   - colspan=3Substitutions: -  MF  14 Frangcyatma Alves   -  MF  23 Jos√© Fonseca   -  DF  17 Nidio Neto   - colspan=3Coach: - colspan=3 F√°bio Magr√£o } } { width=50% style=\\"font-size: 90%\\"  Assistant referees: Alisher Usmanov (Uzbekistan) Ghulam Abbas (Kuwait) Fourth official: Yousef Al-Marzouq (Kuwait) } ==Vietnam vs Malaysia== Malaysia started strongly and could have scored in the first minute, goaltender Ph√≠ Minh Long having to produce a one-handed save to keep D. Saarvindran's free-kick from finding the back of the net. V√µ Huy To√†n had a goal disallowed for offsides, but Vietnam opened the scoring five minutes later as C√¥ng Ph∆∞·ª£ng was fouled in the box by Adam Nor Azlin and M·∫°c H·ªìng Qu√¢n scored from the resulting penalty kick. C√¥ng Ph∆∞·ª£ng grabbed Vietnam's second goal just before hald time as he slotted H·ªì Ng·ªçc Th·∫Øng's pass into the bottom corner. C√¥ng Ph∆∞·ª£ng was tormenting the Malaysian defence and won another penalty kick just moments into the second half as he was fouled by Mohd Farhan Abu Bakar this time, with Huy To√†n given the responsibilities and scoring. Incredibly only six minutes later Vietnam would score again, C√¥ng Ph∆∞·ª£ng with a great free-kick into the top corner. Malaysia finally restored some pride as Nurridzuan Abu Hassan found space in the Vietnamese defence to cross for Syahrul Azwari Ibrahim to score. With ten minutes to go Vietnam restored their four-goal lead when Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn To√†n chipping the ball over Abu Bakar who was off his goal-line to cap off a resounding performance. { width=\\"100%\\" valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"50%\\" { style=\\"font-size: 90%\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" - !width=\\"25\\" !!width=\\"25\\" -  GK  27 Ph√≠ Minh Long -  DF  6 Nguy·ªÖn Minh T√πng   -  DF  26 B√πi Ti·∫øn D≈©ng -  DF  15 Qu·∫ø Ng·ªçc H·∫£i (c) -  DF  22 Nguy·ªÖn Thanh Hi·ªÅn -  MF  2 Nguy·ªÖn H·ªØu D≈©ng  -  MF  11 ƒê·ªó Duy M·∫°nh -  MF  25 V√µ Huy To√†n -  MF  18 H·ªì Ng·ªçc Th·∫Øng   -  FW  17 M·∫°c H·ªìng Qu√¢n  -  FW  10 Nguy·ªÖn C√¥ng Ph∆∞·ª£ng   - colspan=3Substitutions: -  DF  12 V≈© Ng·ªçc Th·ªãnh   -  FW  20 Tr·∫ßn Phi S∆°n   -  FW  19 Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn To√†n   - colspan=3Coach: - colspan=3 Toshiya Miura } valign=\\"top\\" valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"50%\\" { style=\\"font-size: 90%\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" align=\\"center\\" - !width=25 !!width=25 -  GK  1 Mohd Farhan Abu Bakar  -  DF  29 Matthew Davies -  DF  26 Mohd Amer Saidin -  DF  25 Adam Nor Azlin -  DF  17 Mohd Fandi Othman (c) -  MF  12 Gary Steven Robbat   -  MF  16 Nurridzuan Abu Hassan -  MF  28 Mohd Amirul Hisyam Awang Kechik  -  MF  6 D.

They would come to rue that miss in the 24th minute as Jairo Neto slotted Nidio Neto through ball through the Bruneian goalkeeper's to open the scoring. Brunei found a way back in the 68th minute as Asnawi was fouled in the box by Maxanches. Captain Faiq Jefri Bolkiah took the responsibility and confidently smashed the penalty kick home to equalise. However just as in the previous game Brunei conceded again six minutes after equalising, from just outside the box the other Brazilian-born Timorese player in the squad Paulo Helber stole the ball from Muhd Saiful Ammar Hj Adis and unleashed a powerful effort and although Md Ahsanuddin Hj Md Dani got both hands to the shot he could not keep it out. { width=\\"100%\\" valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"50%\\" { style=\\"font-size: 90%\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" - !width=\\"25\\" !!width=\\"25\\" -  GK  12 Ramos Maxanches -  DF  2 Ezequiel Fernandes -  DF  3 Jorge Sabas Victor -  DF  4 Filipe Oliveira  -  MF  17 Nidio Neto   -  DF  18 Candido Oliveira   -  MF  16 Paulo Helber   -  MF  23 Jos√© Fonseca -  MF  11 Nataniel Reis -  FW  6 Anggisu Barbosa (c) -  FW  9 Jairo Neto - colspan=3Substitutions: -  DF  15 Agostinho   -  FW  19 Feliciano Goncalves   -  MF  10 Nilo Soares   - colspan=3Coach: - colspan=3 F√°bio Magr√£o } valign=\\"top\\" valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"50%\\" { style=\\"font-size: 90%\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" align=\\"center\\" - !width=25 !!width=25 -  GK  1 Md Ahsanuddin Hj Md Dani -  DF  4 Md Khairil Shahme Suhaimi -  DF  5 Suhaimi Anak Sulau -  DF  22 Azri Zahari -  DF  24 Mohd Hanif Hamir  -  MF  3 Mohd Asnawi Syazni Aziz   -  MF  8 Ak Yura Indera Putera Pg Yunos   -  MF  10 Muhammad Nur Ikhmal Damit -  MF  11 Md Aminuddin Zakwan Tahir   -  MF  27 Azwan Ali Rahman -  FW  9 Faiq Jefri Bolkiah (c) - colspan=3Substitutions: -  MF  20 Muhd Saiful Ammar Hj Adis   -  FW  21 Mohd Shafie Hj Mohd Effendy   -  MF  19 Ak Mohd Abd Halim Pg Hj Hassan   - colspan=3Coach: - colspan=3 Stephen Ng Heng Seng } } { width=50% style=\\"font-size: 90%\\"  Assistant referees: Saoud Ahmed Al-Maqaleh (Qatar) Saparmammet Gurbanov (Turkmenistan) Fourth official: Hiroyuki Kimura (Japan) } ==Malaysia vs Thailand== The match started at a frenetic pace as with in the first ten minutes Chanathip Songkrasin and Chananan Pombuppha had efforts go just wide. Malaysia too had their chances as a swift counterattack in the 14th minute saw captain Gary Steven Robbat racing towards goal but he shot wide under pressure from Narubadin Weerawatnodom. In the 27th minute Narubadin put in a great cross for the unmarked Thitipan Puangchan right in front off the goal but he somehow headed wide. Narubadin's crosses were troubling the Malaysians and it caused problems again in the 53rd minute as he crossed for Rungrath Poomchantuek and last ditch challenge was needed by Mohd Amer Saidin to prevent the latter from scoring. Malaysia almost took the lead five minutes later when Syahrul Azwari Ibrahim cut inside his defender and unleashed a tremendous curling effort destined for the top corner which Thai goalkeeper Chanin Sae-Eae had to be at full stretch to keep out. Thailand had an even better chance themselves in the 68th minute when Mohd Farhan Abu Bakar had to dive down low to keep Tanaboon Kesarat's long range effort out, and the rebound was pounced upon by Chananan but his shot was deflected by a Malaysian defender for a corner. But a goal did come nine minutes from time as Tristan Do passed to his captain Sarach Yooyen who from just outside the box unleashed a powerful left-footed effort that gave the Malaysian goalkeeper no chance. Thailand could have even scored another when Nurul Sriyankem was one-on-one with the goalkeeper but Abu Bakar managed to make the block. Nonetheless Thailand held on through six minutes of additional time to confirm the win. { width=\\"100%\\" valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"50%\\" { style=\\"font-size: 90%\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" - !width=\\"25\\" !!width=\\"25\\" -  GK  1 Mohd Farhan Abu Bakar -  DF  3 Shahrul Mohd Saad  -  DF  21 Nazirul Naim Che Hashim -  DF  29 Matthew Davies -  DF  26 Mohd Amer Saidin -  DF  24 Ariff Farhan Isa   -  MF  12 Gary Steven Robbat (c) -  MF  16 Nurridzuan Abu Hassan   -  MF  28 Mohd Amirul Hisyam Awang Kechik -  MF  6 D.

Chenrop would score again thirteen minutes later as he was completely unmarked to head in Chaowat Veerachat's cross. Rungrath Poomchantuek had a goal disallowed for offsides three minutes before that, but Thailand kept attacking and where rewarded with another goal six minutes after the break when Pakorn Prempak taped a free-kick to Thitipan who blasted the shot into the net. Tristan Do was next to score as the defender stole the ball from Suhaimi Anak Sulau and proceeded to shoot past Md Ahsanuddin Hj Md Dani although the Bruneian goalkeeper probably could have done better. He himself was injured on the play and had to be substituted, but his replacement Md Nur Syazwan Halidi could not stop another substitute Nurul Sriyankem from scoring in stoppage time as Thailand made it five. The result also guarantied Thailand would advance out of the group. { width=\\"100%\\" valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"50%\\" { style=\\"font-size: 90%\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" - !width=\\"25\\" !!width=\\"25\\" -  GK  20 Somporn Yos -  DF  3 Suriya Singmui -  DF  5 Adisorn Promrak (c) -  DF  19 Tristan Do  -  MF  4 Chaowat Veerachat -  MF  17 Tanaboon Kesarat -  MF  14 Pakorn Prempak -  MF  7 Thitipan Puangchan   -  MF  24 Siwakorn Jakkuprasat  -  MF  29 Rungrath Poomchantuek -  FW  22 Chenrop Samphaodi   - colspan=3Substitutions: -  MF  11 Pinyo Inpinit   -  MF  12 Nurul Sriyankem   - colspan=3Coach: - colspan=3 Choketawee Promrut } valign=\\"top\\" valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"50%\\" { style=\\"font-size: 90%\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" align=\\"center\\" - !width=25 !!width=25 -  GK  1 Md Ahsanuddin Hj Md Dani   -  DF  2 Mohd Nur Azees Awang Ali -  DF  4 Md Khairil Shahme Suhaimi -  DF  5 Suhaimi Anak Sulau -  DF  12 Mohd Aman Hj Abd Rahim -  DF  24 Mohd Hanif Hamir -  DF  25 Mohd Rakin Ramli -  MF  18 Muhammad Nadzri Hj Erwan   -  MF  19 Ak Mohd Abd Halim Pg Hj Hassan -  FW  21 Mohd Shafie Hj Mohd Effendy -  FW  9 Faiq Jefri Bolkiah (c)   - colspan=3Substitutions: -  FW  29 Md Nur Syazwan Halidi   -  MF  8 Ak Yura Indera Putera Pg Yunos  -  GK  30 Abdul Hafiz Abdul Rahim   - colspan=3Coach: - colspan=3 Stephen Ng Heng Seng } } { width=50% style=\\"font-size: 90%\\"  Assistant referees: Alisher Usmanov (Uzbekistan) Saparmammet Gurbanov (Turkmenistan) Fourth official: Ma Ning (China) } ==Timor-Leste vs Vietnam== Vietnam opened the scoring in the twelfth minute as Tr·∫ßn Phi S∆°n headed in a cross from his captain Qu·∫ø Ng·ªçc H·∫£i.

Nonetheless there was still plenty to play for as the winner would top the group and both teams played a fast-paced, physical, and attacking game. Chananan Pombuppha had two great chances in the opening twenty minutes but on both occasions his effort was wide. Chananan redeemed himself in the 22nd minute as it was his pass that set up Pakorn Prempak to score the opening goal from an acute angle. Pakorn could have had a second eight minutes later when this time Chaowat Veerachat with the pass but the former's shot was straight at Vietnamese goalkeeper Ph·∫°m VƒÉn Ti·∫øn. Just moments latter Vietnam had the chance to equalise but Ph·∫°m M·∫°nh H√πng's cross to the unmarked ƒê·ªó Duy M·∫°nh was headed wide. In similar circumstances before the end of the half Tr·∫ßn Phi S∆°n, whose pace and skill caused Thailand all sorts of problems, found L√™ Thanh B√¨nh with a great pass, but although the former was again unmarked he too headed off target. Thailand thought they had doubled their advantage in the 51st minute when Chaowat passed it to Chananan only for the latter to see his effort come off the woodwork. Nonetheless they would get their second when Pakorn who was adjudged to have been fouled in the box by B√πi Ti·∫øn D≈©ng. Thitipan Puangchan took the responsibility and calmly scored the penalty kick. With sixteen minutes to go Thanh B√¨nh was denied by a sliding challenge from Thai captain Adisorn Promrak, and three minutes later it was three for Thailand as Tristan Do managed to turn the defender marking him before unleashing a powerful curling shot perfectly placed in the top corner. in the last minute of the game Vietnam would grab a consolation goal as Thanh B√¨nh turned and volleyed a pass in spectacular style to make some amends for the chances he missed earlier in the game, as Thailand conceded their first goal of the tournament but still topped the group in an entertaining game. { width=\\"100%\\" valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"50%\\" { style=\\"font-size: 90%\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" - !width=\\"25\\" !!width=\\"25\\" -  GK  1 Ph·∫°m VƒÉn Ti·∫øn -  DF  3 Ph·∫°m M·∫°nh H√πng (c) -  DF  12 V≈© Ng·ªçc Th·ªãnh -  DF  22 Nguy·ªÖn Thanh Hi·ªÅn -  DF  26 B√πi Ti·∫øn D≈©ng   -  MF  23 Ph·∫°m ƒê·ª©c Huy -  MF  14 Nguy·ªÖn Huy H√πng   -  MF  16 L√™ Thanh B√¨nh -  MF  11 ƒê·ªó Duy M·∫°nh   -  FW  19 Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn To√†n -  FW  20 Tr·∫ßn Phi S∆°n - colspan=3Substitutions: -  DF  6 Nguy·ªÖn Minh T√πng  -  MF  18 H·ªì Ng·ªçc Th·∫Øng   -  FW  10 Nguy·ªÖn C√¥ng Ph∆∞·ª£ng   - colspan=3Coach: - colspan=3 Toshiya Miura } valign=\\"top\\" valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"50%\\" { style=\\"font-size: 90%\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" align=\\"center\\" - !width=25 !!width=25 -  GK  1 Chanin Sae-Eae -  DF  5 Adisorn Promrak (c) -  DF  2 Peerapat Notechaiya   -  DF  19 Tristan Do -  DF  8 Artit Daosawang -  MF  4 Chaowat Veerachat -  MF  7 Thitipan Puangchan  -  MF  14 Pakorn Prempak   -  MF  24 Siwakorn Jakkuprasat -  MF  11 Pinyo Inpinit   -  FW  23 Chananan Pombuppha - colspan=3Substitutions: -  DF  3 Suriya Singmui   -  MF  29 Rungrath Poomchantuek   -  FW  22 Chenrop Samphaodi   - colspan=3Coach: - colspan=3 Choketawee Promrut } } { width=50% style=\\"font-size: 90%\\"  Assistant referees: Saparmammet Gurbanov (Turkmenistan) Ghulam Abbas (Kuwait) Fourth official: Mooud Bonyadifard (Iran) } ==Laos vs Malaysia== { width=\\"100%\\" valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"50%\\" { style=\\"font-size: 90%\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" - !width=\\"25\\" !!width=\\"25\\" -  GK  18 Soukthavy Soundala -  DF  12 Thenthong Phonsettha -  DF  14 Soukchinda Natphasouk   -  MF  21 Tiny Bounmalay (c) -  MF  15 Phoutthasay Khochalern -  MF  7 Khonesavanh Sihavong   -  MF  11 Maitee Maitee -  MF  10 Soukaphone Vongchiengkham   -  MF  8 Keoviengphet Liththideth -  FW  2 Thinnakone Vongsa -  FW  16 Sinnalone Sihalath - colspan=3Substitutions: -  MF  17 Vilayout Sayyabounsou   -  FW  9 Sitthideth Khanthavong  -  FW  23 Xaisongkham Champathong   - colspan=3Coach: - colspan=3 Dave Booth } valign=\\"top\\" valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"50%\\" { style=\\"font-size: 90%\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" align=\\"center\\" - !width=25 !!width=25 -  GK  1 Mohd Farhan Abu Bakar -  DF  3 Shahrul Mohd Saad -  DF  29 Matthew Davies -  DF  26 Mohd Amer Saidin  -  DF  17 Mohd Fandi Othman (c) -  MF  12 Gary Steven Robbat -  MF  16 Nurridzuan Abu Hassan   -  MF  18 Syahrul Azwari Ibrahim -  MF  19 Muhamad Faizat Mohd Ghazli   -  MF  8 Saiful Ridzuwan Selamat -  FW  9 Muhammad Syafiq Ahmad   - colspan=3Substitutions: -  DF  21 Nazirul Naim Che Hashim   -  DF  24 Ariff Farhan Isa   -  DF  5 Muhammad Syazwan Tajudin   - colspan=3Coach: - colspan=3 Ong Kim Swee } } { width=50% style=\\"font-size: 90%\\"  Assistant referees: Ghulam Abbas (Kuwait) Ahmed Ferdous (Bangladesh) Fourth official: Hiroyuki Kimura (Japan) } ==References== Group B ","title":"Football at the 2015 Southeast Asian Games ‚Äì Group B"},{"id":"46854157","text":"The Mahlac Pictograph Cave is a rock art site on the island of Guam.

Preneuse had originally been part of a powerful squadron of six frigates sent to the Indian Ocean in 1796 under the command of Contre-amiral Pierre C√©sar Charles de Sercey, but the squadron dispersed in 1798 and by the summer of 1799 Preneuse was the only significant French warship remaining in the region. The battle was the culmination of a three- month raiding cruise by the 40-gun French Navy frigate Preneuse, commanded by Captain Jean-Matthieu-Adrien Lhermitte. Ordered to raid British commerce in the Mozambique Channel, Lhermitte's cruise had been eventful, with an inconclusive encounter with a squadron of small British warships in Algoa Bay on 20 September and an engagement with the 50-gun HMS Jupiter during heavy weather on 9‚Äì11 October. Returning to √éle de France in December, Lhermitte steered for Port Louis but was intercepted by the British blockade squadron, comprising the 74-gun ship of the line HMS Tremendous and the 50-gun HMS Adamant. Unable to reach safety, Lhermitte evaded pursuit long enough to drive Preneuse onto a beach at the mouth of the Tombeau. After a brief exchange of fire the wrecked frigate was surrendered and British boarding parties in ship's boats rowed inshore to Preneuse, removed the survivors and burnt the remains. Watching from the shore as the last of his command burned on the beach, Sercey subsequently retired from military service. ==Background== In 1796 British Royal Navy dominance in the East Indies during the French Revolutionary Wars was challenged by the arrival of a squadron of six French Navy frigates, commanded by Contre-amiral Pierre C√©sar Charles de Sercey. Among these ships was the new 40-gun frigate Preneuse, commanded by Captain Jean-Matthieu-Adrien Lhermitte. Preneuse had not sailed from France with Sercey, instead passing independently through the Atlantic and uniting with the squadron at Port Louis on √éle de France. Sercey deployed his squadron to the Dutch East Indies, but suffered frustration at the Action of 9 September 1796 and the Bali Strait Incident of January 1797 and subsequently returned to the base at Port Louis. There the squadron began to fracture, with a succession of ships sent back to France or detached on independent missions. Preneuse separated in March 1798, carrying messages of support and 86 military volunteers for the Tipu Sultan of the Kingdom of Mysore, an enemy of the British in Southern India who sought to form an alliance with France. Lhermitte's instructions emphasised subtlety in the operation, but on 20 April he attacked the British port of Tellicherry and seized the East Indiaman merchant ships Woodcot and Raymond. This alerted the British to Preneuse's mission and although the reinforcements were landed safely at Mangalore on 24 April, diplomatic relations between the British and Mysore collapsed, leading to the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War the following year in which Tipu Sultan was killed and his kingdom absorbed into British India. Lhermitte then sailed to rejoin Sercey and the corvette Br√ªle-Gueule at Batavia in the Dutch East Indies for a planned junction with an allied Spanish squadron at Manila. This combined force then attacked an East India Company convoy gathering in the Pearl River in January 1799, but in the ensuing Macau Incident they were driven off by the Royal Navy escort squadron. Dispirited, Sercey returned westwards to √éle de France, narrowly avoiding an unequal battle with a large British squadron blockading the port. On arrival he discovered that Preneuse and Br√ªle-Gueule were the only ships remaining of his original command, the others having returned to France or been lost in battle. ==BattleAlgoa Bay=== Affaire de la Preneuse, L. Garneray, 1837 In September 1799 Sercey dispersed his remaining ships. Br√ªle-Gueule was sent back to France on 26 September carrying condemned political prisoners; the corvette was eventually wrecked on the Pointe du Raz with heavy loss of life. Preneuse was ordered to operate against British trade off the coast of Southeast Africa, sailing from Port Louis on 4 August. Lhermitte focused his efforts on the Mozambique Channel and the approaches to the British Cape Colony and on 20 September encountered a squadron anchored in Algoa Bay comprising the 24-gun naval storeship HMS Camel, the 16-gun HMS Rattlesnake (1791) and the schooner Surprise, the former ships lying with their masts and rigging removed. This force was supporting an expeditionary army under General Francis Dundas fighting the Third Xhosa War. Camel was laden with military supplies but neither ship was prepared for battle, with a 30 of Camel's sailors and 15 from Rattlesnake trapped on shore by the surf. Lhermitte approached the anchored ships at 18:00, flying false Danish colours, and anchored nearby. A ship's boat from Camel approached the new arrival, rapidly realising that Preneuse was a hostile frigate and returning to their ship. Lieutenant William Fothergill, the most senior officer with the convoy, fired warning shots close to the frigate, which Lhermitte ignored. Both British ships then prepared for action. At 20:30, Preneuse began to approach Rattlesnake and Fothergill opened fire immediately, joined by Camel. Lhermitte returned fire, focusing its broadside on Camel. By midnight Camel had taken several shot in the hull causing widespread flooding, and the crew ceased firing to man the pumps. Lhermitte apparently believed that Camel had abandoned the fight and he switched fire towards Rattlesnake, the engagement continuing until 03:30 at which point Lhermitte slipped his anchor and pulled out of range. Remaining in the bay until 10:00 before standing out to sea. British losses were two killed and twelve wounded, both Camel and Rattlesnake badly damaged. It was later reported in French sources that Lhermitte believed the schooner Surprise to be a well armed naval brig, prompting his withdrawal. Preneuse's loss in the action was around 40 killed and wounded, and the frigate was reported to be badly damaged; messages to this effect were hastily sent to the commander at the Cape, Captain George Losack who sent the 50-gun HMS Jupiter in pursuit. On 9 October after spending the night with the convoy in Algoa Bay, Jupiter discovered Preneuse at and gave chase. The sea was turbulent due to a strong gale from the northwest and the chase continued into the evening before Captain William Granger was able to fire ranging shot at the French ship. Lhermitte responded with his sternchasers. Granger rapidly gained on the damaged Preneuse but the state of the sea made it impossible for him to safely open his lower deck gunports and a long-range duel continued at high speed throughout the night and much of the following two days. At 14:00 on 10 October Granger was finally close enough to bring Lhermitte to action, but found that with his 24-pounder guns unusable he was restricted to his upper deck 12-pounder guns, which were no match for Lhermitte's main battery. As a result, the rigging on Jupiter was rapidly shot away and the British ship fell back for urgent repairs and Preneuse was able to take the opportunity to escape. Granger returned to Table Bay on 16 October. Algoa Bay, 20‚Äì21 September 1799. French frigate Preneuse against HMS Camel and the privateer Surprise ===Chase off Port Louis=== Lhermitte had little subsequent success, and Preneuse returned to Port Louis in early December 1799. The entrance to the port was blockaded by the 74-gun ship of the line HMS Tremendous under Captain John Osborn (Royal Navy officer)https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/A_Naval_Biographical_Dictionary/Byron,_George_AnsonA Naval Biographical Dictionary/Byron, George Ansonhttp://www.pbenyon.plus.com/Navy_List_1805/Officers/Captains.htmlCaptains Serving in the Royal Navy - May 1805 and the 50-gun HMS Adamant under Captain William Hotham. These ships had been sent specifically to intercept Preneuse, arriving at Port Louis on 7 December and successfully intercepting the merchant French vessels Benjamin and Bienfait and the Spanish Nuestra Se√±ora del Carmen. Four days later they sighted the approaching frigate and chased it northeast, Adamant pressing so close that Lhermitte could not escape and was forced to drive the frigate on shore at the mouth of the Tombeau River within range of a large shore battery. At 15:00 Lhermitte ordered the masts on Preneuse to be cut away and the frigate and battery then opened fire on Adamant, which was carefully sailing through the coastal shoals in an effort to engage the beached French ship. For more than two hours Hotham's ship worked its way inshore until at 17:30 it was well positioned to open fire, unleashing its broadside on the wrecked Preneuse. By 17:45 it was clear that further resistance was futile and Lhermitte struck his colours. Preneuse had surrendered, but was likely damaged beyond repair. Hotham and Osborn discussed the situation and determined to destroy the wreck to deny it to the French. To this end, three cutters were gathered and a boarding party under Lieutenant Edward Grey sent in to attack Preneuse at 20:00. This party came under fire from the batteries but was able to successfully access the battered French frigate at 21:00, finding that only the officers and a handful of sailors remained, the others having been given the opportunity to escape to the shore in boats rather than become prisoners of war. Among the captives was Lhermitte, who was permitted to bring his personal baggage with him before he was brought to the British squadron as a prisoner. Grey then set the wrecked ship alight before returning to Adamant, having executed his orders without losing a single man. ==Aftermath== As Preneuse had gone ashore near Port Louis, Sercey had come to observe the engagement and therefore witnessed the destruction of the last of his squadron of 1796. A commander without a command he subsequently took ship back to France and there retired from his commission, later returning to his family and settling on √éle de France. The action temporarily left the French with no naval forces in the East Indies at all, although raiding cruises by privateers still posed a considerable threat to the British Indian Ocean trade routes. The only subsequent reinforcement to arrive in the region during the war was the frigate Chiffone was intercepted and captured at the Battle of Mah√© shortly after arrival in 1801, although substantial reinforcements did reach √éle de France before the outbreak of the Napoleonic Wars in 1803. Lhermitte subsequently came under criticism from historians for his failure to inflict greater damage on the light force in Algoa Bay: William James described it as \\"a somewhat discreditable action\\". Granger was also heavily criticised for his performance in the action on 11 October: William Laird Clowes considered that \\"No explanation of the Jupiter's failure can be given\\", while James wrote of the action with Jupiter that \\"Undoubtedly it was a cause of triumph to Captain L'Hermite and well calculated to wipe away the disgrace incurred by Preneuse at Algoa bay\\". ==CitationsReferences== * * at Internet Archive * * * Category:Conflicts in 1799 Category:1799 in France Category:Naval battles involving France Category:Naval battles involving Great Britain Category:Naval battles of the French Revolutionary Wars Category:Military history of Mauritius ","title":"Battle of Port Louis"},{"id":"46854236","text":"Guillermina Dulch√© is a Mexican painter, whose work has been recognized with membership in the Sal√≥n de la Pl√°stica Mexicana.

In beam-park mode, a radar beam is kept in a fixed direction with respect to the Earth, while objects passing through the beam are tracked. In 24 hours, as a result of the Earth‚Äôs rotation, the radar effectively scans a narrow strip through 360¬∞ of the celestial sphere. The scattered waves are detected by a receiver and the measurements obtained during the observations can be used to determine object radar cross-section, time of peak occurrence, polarization ratio, doppler shift and object rotation. The obtained information for each object is then processed and matched against data from previously catalogued objects. The beam-park mode can be used to detect both previously known and uncatalogued objects at any altitude, provided that the reflected power captured by the receiver can be distinguished from the noise. This limits the use of radar-based beam park observations to objects in Low- Earth Orbit (LEO). Optical instruments, in turn, have very good performance for objects in Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) and in Geostationary Transfer Orbit (GTO). The radar technique typically outperforms optical facilities in LEO and can conduct observations for longer periods, both during day and night, independently of the weather and object illumination by sunlight. The tracking sensitivity of radar-based space debris tracking systems can be further improved if they are working in conjunction with another transmitter or receiver, forming a bistatic radar system. ==History== Several US radars were the first to start carrying out beam-park tracking. These were the Haystack Radar in Massachusetts, Goldstone Radar in California, and multiple radars at the Kwajalein Atoll. Most notable, the Haystack radar is capable of tracking objects as small as 2 mm. The first known European beam-park experiments were carried out by the German TIRA system in 1993. Performing observations in the L-band during a 10-hour long experiment, the system was able to detect small-sized objects in LEO. The first 24-hour operational measurement campaign was performed on 13‚Äì14 December 1994, with TIRA and the Fylingdales Phased-Array Radar. TIRA can also be used as a transmitter, part of a bistatic system, in conjunction with the Effelsberg Radio Telescope, functioning as a receiver, where the combined system has a detection size threshold of 1 cm. Dedicated space surveillance sensors, often operating in beam-park mode, include the French GRAVES bistatic radar, the defunct US Air Force Space Surveillance System (Space Fence) and its replacement Space Fence. Other systems currently used for space surveillance that operate in beam-park mode include the multistatic EISCAT incoherent scatter radar system and the Medicina Radio Observatory's Northern Cross Radio Telescope and 32 m parabolic dish antenna. ==See also== * ESA Space Situational Awareness Programme * US Space Surveillance Network * Kessler syndrome ==References== Category:Space debris Category:Space radars ","title":"Beam park"},{"id":"46854341","text":"Tobias Kamke was the defending champion, but lost in the first round to Christian Lindell.
