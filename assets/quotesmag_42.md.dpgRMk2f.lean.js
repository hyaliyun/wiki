A hillock is identified even today by his name called Thirumalayyana Gudda. He had one hundred wives. He was very strict in his administration and maintenance of law and order. There was a poor old woman with two sons. She had lost her husband in young age and brought up her sons with great difficulty. They were simple minded and used to work as labourers in the fields. It was very difficult to lead the life with their meagre income. These two young men went near the tank in the early hours of an unlucky day and found some Jowar (maize) crop yield leftovers on a rock by the side of the hillock. They brought it home without expecting any harm. The yield had been stolen by some thieves the previous night from the field of a farmer of the village. Meanwhile the farmer complained the matter to the Palegar who promptly ordered an enquiry. The servants of the Palegar found the leftovers of the yield in front of the house of the old woman who supposedly did not own a piece of land. The sons of the old woman were immediately arrested. The poor old woman pleaded innocence of her sons with the Palegar, explaining the facts. But the witnesses were against them and they were executed. Soon after the cremation of the bodies of her sons, the old woman cursed the village be destroyed with the rain of fire within a day and ended her life jumping into the tank. She also cursed the farmers:Jowar crop sown by any farmer be destroyed without a trace and the farmer be subjected to the fury of the village deity, Sadalamma. Sadalamma Temple. Accordingly the original Sadali was supposed to have been destroyed by the rain of fire and the present town had been built to the east of the old town after this event. Until recently the farmers of the town were afraid of sowing Jowar in their fields.As told to children of the village by their grandmothers. ==Present condition== Chennakeshava temple, [known as Peddagudi (= Big Temple)] in a dilapidated and neglected condition, is still standing as an eye witness to this gory incident.

The book is part of the Voyages extraordinaires series. Like The Begum's Millions, which Verne published in 1879, it has the theme of France and the entire world threatened by a super-weapon with the threat finally overcome through the force of French patriotism. It can be considered one of the first books dealing with problems which were to become paramount half a century after its publication in World War II and the Cold War: brilliant scientists discovering new weapons of great destructive power, whose full utilization might literally destroy the world; the competition between superpowers to obtain overwhelming stockpiles of such weapons; and, efforts of other nations to join the nuclear club. ==Plot summary== Thomas Roch, a brilliant French inventor, has designed the Fulgurator, a weapon so powerful that \\"the state which acquired it would become absolute master of earth and ocean.\\" However, unable to sell his unproven idea to France or any other government, Roch begins to lose his sanity, becoming bitter, megalomaniacal and paranoid. The United States Government reacts by tucking him away at a luxurious asylum in New Bern, North Carolina, where he is visited by one \\"Count d'Artigas\\"‚Äîactually Ker Karraje, a notorious pirate of Malagasy origin. His heterogeneous crew is drawn from \\"escaped convicts, military and naval deserters, and the scum of Europe.\\" Karraje and his crew lead double lives. Karraje goes around openly, under the alias of \\"Count d'Artigas\\", a pleasure- loving, slightly eccentric but eminently respectable member of nobility. He is a regular visitor to the ports of the East Coast aboard his schooner Ebba. To outward appearances, Ebba has no other means of propulsion than its sails, but in fact, it is pulled by an underwater tug. By this means, Karraje and his crew can pull up to becalmed sailing vessels without raising suspicion and board them without warning. They then rob and massacre the crews, scuttling the ships, adding to the statistics of \\"unexplained disappearances\\". Karraje hears of Roch and his invention takes them both seriously and decides to gain possession of them. Actually, his aim is rather modest. He has no intention to seize mastery over the world, but just to make his hide-out impregnable. He and his men successfully kidnap Roch from his American asylum, and then bring him to their hide-out‚Äîthe desolate island of Back Cup in the Bermudas. Here a wide cavern, accessible only by submerged submarine, has been made into a well-equipped pirate base. It has its own electrical power plant and is completely unknown to the rest of the world. During the kidnapping, however, Karraje orders his men to also take along Gaydon, Roch's attendant for the past fifteen months. The reader knows (and, as is later shown, Karraje is also aware) that Gaydon is actually Simon Hart, a French engineer and explosives expert. Hart had decided \\"to perform the menial and exacting duties of an insane man's attendant\\" in the hope of learning Roch's secret and, thereby, saving it for France, actuated by \\"a spirit of the purest and noblest patriotism.\\" Hart is kept imprisoned at the pirate base, though in quite comfortable conditions. He can only watch in dismay as the pirate chief easily manages what four governments in succession have failed to do: win Roch over. Roch is given \\"many rolls of dollar bills and banknotes, and handfuls of English, French, American and German gold coins\\" with which to fill his pockets. Further, Roch is formally informed that the entire secret cavern and all in it are henceforward his property, and egged on to \\"defend his property\\" against the world which has wronged him so badly. Soon, the inventor is busy constructing his fearsome weapon, happily unaware that he is nothing but a glorified prisoner in the pirate's hands. The paranoid Roch does, however, keep to himself the secret of the detonator or \\"Deflagrator\\", a liquid without which the explosive is merely an inert powder. By holding fast to that last secret, Roch unwittingly preserves the life of his ex-keeper Gaydon/Simon Hart. Karraje suspects, wrongly, that Hart knows much more of Roch's secrets than he is willing to let on. It serves the purposes of the pirate chief, a completely ruthless killer, to let Hart live. The pirate engineer Serko, Hart's \\"colleague,\\" hopes to win him over in prolonged friendly conversations. Hart's reticence is misunderstood as proof that he has something to hide. The pirates underestimate Hart, giving him a practically free run of their hide- out since the only way out is via submarine. But after carefully studying the currents, Hart succeeds in secretly sending out a message in a metal keg, giving the full details of Karraje's operations and his impending acquisition of the Fulgurator. The message gets through to the British authorities at their nearby naval base in Bermuda, and the British Navy sends a submarine, , to find Hart. The submarine's crew makes contact with Hart, and take him and Roch on board, but the Sword is discovered, attacked and sunk by the pirates in a direct underwater submarine vs. submarine battle. The unconscious Hart and Roch are extracted from the sunken British sub by pirate divers, leaving the entire British crew to perish. Hart manages to convince the pirates that he had been kidnapped by the British sailors and had nothing to do with their \\"visit.\\" He resumes his role as a tolerated prisoner with a free run of the pirate base. Meanwhile, Roch's weapon is completed and becomes operational. A hastily gathered international naval task force approaches the island, consisting of five warships dispatched by the world's five largest powers. The weapon, operated personally by Roch himself, works fully as advertised. Roch has no compunction in using it on British or American ships, and the first cruiser to approach the island is easily destroyed with only a handful of its crew surviving. Undaunted, the next ship approaches the shore, and the moment comes towards which the entire book was leading and from which its title was drawn: \\"A flag unfurls to the breeze. It is the Tricolour, whose blue, white and red sections stand out luminously against the sky. Ah! What is this? Thomas Roch is fascinated at the sight of his national emblem. Slowly he lowers his arm as the flag flutters up to the mast-head. Then he draws back and covers his eyes with his hand. Heavens above! All sentiment of patriotism is not then dead in his ulcerated heart, seeing that it beats at the sight of his country's flag!\\" Having at the moment of truth, rediscovered his patriotism, Roch refuses to fire on his country's ship. He struggles with the pirates who try to seize his phial and the Deflagrator. During the struggle, Roch resorts to blowing up himself, his weapon, and the pirates along with the entire island. The single survivor of the cataclysm is Simon Hart, whose unconscious body with the diary at his side is found by the landing French sailors. Hart is eventually revived, to be amply rewarded for his dedication to his country. He proudly bears witness to Thomas Roch's last-minute change of heart and self-sacrifice. French patriotism is the moral and material victor. ==Response== Following publication of the book, Verne was sued by the chemist Eug√®ne Turpin, inventor of the explosive Melinite, who recognized himself in the character of Roch and was not amused. Turpin had tried to sell his invention to the French government, which in 1885 refused it, though later purchasing it (it was extensively used in the First World War); but Turpin had never gone mad, nor did he ever offer his invention to any but the Government of France, so he had some justified grievance. Verne was successfully defended by Raymond Poincar√©, later president of France. A letter to Verne's brother Paul seems to suggest, however, that after all Turpin was indeed the model for Roch. The character of Roch and his revolutionary powerful explosive might also have been inspired by the real-life Alfred Nobel who invented dynamite and later reportedly regretted having introduced such a destructive force into the world. ==Politics== The book was written and published when France was in the throes of the Dreyfus Affair, Frenchmen were deeply divided over whether or not the Jewish officer Alfred Dreyfus was guilty of treason and espionage on behalf of the hated Germany (and over more fundamental issues bound up with the Dreyfus case). Verne is known to have initially supported the right-wing anti-Dreyfusards. The question whether or not Verne was an anti-semite is hotly debated; while Walter A. McDougall finds \\"no overt evidence of anti- Semitism on Verne's part,\\" Brian Taves and Jean-Michel Margot note that his Off on a Comet contains \\"unflattering Shylock-style stereotypes.\\" Be that as it may, Verne certainly was a nationalist caught up in the mindset of revanchism, to whom the idea of a French army officer, Jewish or not, spying for Germany would be the greatest of anathemas; and initially Verne, like most French people, believed Dreyfus to be guilty. However, in 1899 Verne came to support a judicial review of the Dreyfus case. While Roch cannot be said to represent Dreyfus in any concrete way, the theme of an apparent traitor, who in the end proves to be a self-sacrificing patriot, may be connected to the change of heart which Verne (and many readers) underwent about Dreyfus. ==Legacy== Film historian Thomas C. Renzi considers Roch the archetype of the \\"mad scientist,\\" the thriller fiction stock character of a monomaniac whose warped genius endangers the world. If so, much of 20th-century thriller fiction, including such films as Thunderball and Barbarella, may be considered direct descendants of Facing the Flag. In 1958, Czech director Karel Zeman used the novel as the basis for his 1958 film Vyn√°lez zk√°zy (a.k.a. The Deadly Invention and The Fabulous World of Jules Verne). The film, which made considerable use of the steel engravings in the original editions of Verne's novels, won the Grand Prix at the International Film Festival at Expo 58 in Brussels. And, to a lesser extent, this novel also inspired the climactic scene, at Vulcania, in the 1954 Walt Disney film 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea (adapted from Verne's better-known novel of the same name).. In 2012 French comics artist Goux adapted the novel into a comic book, Le Fulgurateur Roch.https://www.lambiek.net/artists/g/goux.htm == References External links== * * Original French text *For the Flag English text version with full page cover and page images from the Baldwin Library of Historical Children's Literature and the University of Florida Digital Collections * Category:1896 French novels Category:1896 science fiction novels Category:French science fiction novels Category:Novels by Jules Verne Category:Military fiction Category:Pirate books Category:French novels adapted into films Category:Novels set in North Carolina Category:Suicide in fiction Category:Novels adapted into comics Category:Nautical fiction ","title":"Facing the Flag"},{"id":"5598684","text":"William Trufant Foster William Trufant Foster (January 18, 1879 ‚Äì October 8, 1950), was an American educator and economist, whose theories were especially influential in the 1920s. He was the first president of Reed College. == Early life and education == Foster was born in Boston, Massachusetts on January 18, 1879. He attended Roxbury High School in Boston. He graduated from Harvard University with an A.B. in 1901 and an A.M. in 1904. ==Career== Foster was an instructor of English at Bates College in Maine, from 1901‚Äì03 and served as a coach of Bates' internationally known debate program. Foster was also professor of English and Argumentation at Bowdoin College in Maine in 1905. He authored \\"Argumentation and Debating\\", published in 1908. Foster eventually received a Ph.D. in 1911 from Teachers College, Columbia University. His conception of \\"the ideal college\\" set out in the concluding chapter of his dissertation, led to his appointment as the first president of Reed College. He serced from 1911 to 1919. He rejected intercollegiate sports and greek life in favor of an intense academic education. He fostered close intellectual collaboration between faculty and students. He treated undergraduates as if they were graduate students and created a system of small seminars, comprehensive examinations, undergraduate research, and senior theses. He was director of the Pollak Foundation of Economic Research from 1920 to 1950, in Newton, Massachusetts, where he emphasized the need to protect consumer interests. == Economics == He collaborated with his Harvard classmate Waddill Catchings in a series of economics books that were highly influential in the United States in the 1920s. His influential books, written with Catchings, were Money (1923), Profits (1925), Business Without a Buyer (1927), The Road to Plenty (1928), and Progress and Plenty (1930). With Catchings, he was one of the leading pre-Keynesian economists, in the underconsumptionist tradition, advocating similar issues to Keynes such as the paradox of thrift and economic interventionism. The two are now rarely mentioned in contemporary economics texts, standing as they do in the shadow of Keynes's The General Theory. Foster and Catchings rejected traditional laissez-faire economics and called for aggressive federal involvement to balance the economy lest destabilizing forces upset prosperity. The main problem was underconsumption, which could be overcome by strategic government spending in public works. The theory strongly influenced the anti-depression programs of Herbert Hoover, Franklin D.

Canfora has also performed on television for the educational series TV411. He also wrote for the show. His career as a writer began in the mid-1990s as a sketch writer for various New York-based sketch groups. After his sketch group \\"The Waiting Room\\" disbanded in 1999, he turned to playwriting, beginning with one-act comedies which were performed regionally in different parts of the United States. ==Works== Place Setting In September, 2005, his play Place Setting was read in Los Angeles, directed by veteran film director Howard Deutch and starring Jon Cryer and Steven Weber. In June 2007, Canfora performed in Place Setting at the New Jersey Repertory Company. The play received largely positive reviews. Talkinbroadway.com said that while the play wasn't especially original, it did \\"provide witty, involving and thought provoking entertainment.\\" It also praised his performance in the role of Greg. Curtainup.com wrote \\"Canfora, who skillfully embraces both acting and writing, may not leave any of the characters unscarred or unscathed, but we are certainly kept alert and empathetic to their quandaries.\\" \\"The Newark Star-Ledger called the play \\"funny and fascinating,\\" adding that \\"Canfora has wonderfully incisive wit\\". The Newark Star Ledger nominated \\"Place Setting\\" for \\"Best Play\\" for 2007-2008 along with plays by Edward Albee, Theresa Rebeck, and Elaine May. In July, 2008, \\"Place Setting\\" had a public reading at the Soho Theatre in London, UK. A World with Snow/Poetic License In March 2005, his play A World with Snow was read publicly in New York City and starred Austin Pendleton. In September, 2008, the New Jersey Repertory Company produced his play Poetic License (also known as A World with Snow) to largely mixed reviews. The New York Times wrote of the play and its characters \\"All their relationships are clearly drawn, and their dialogue is at once educated, revealing and lively. Part of the fascination of the play‚Äôs first hour lies simply in the caliber of their verbal interaction. But the other part of it lies in the surprise twists Mr. Canfora has cooked up (which make discussion of the play‚Äôs specifics difficult without revealing too much). The two he lets fly in the first act are both stunners. \\" However, it contends that the second act fell flat and urged Canfora to revise the second act, writing that in this incarnation the play was only a \\"glorious tease.\\" He completed a rewrite of the play in March, 2010. The play had its Off-Broadway debut at 59E59 Theaters in February, 2012, starring Canadian actor Geraint Wyn-Davies. It received generally strong reviews. The New York Post wrote\\" It‚Äôs hard to imagine that a crackling drama could revolve around a poet laureate‚Äôs career. But Jack Canfora‚Äôs ‚ÄúPoetic License‚Äù manages to render a tale of artistic ambition and hidden secrets with the breathlessness of a well-paced thriller.\\" The Associated Press and TIme Out New York offered similar praise, and the New York Times, while criticizing the plot's central premise, described it as \\"smartly written.\\" Abingdon Theatre named Canfora, on the strength of \\"Poetic License,\\" the winner of the 2011 Christopher Brian Wolk award for playwriting. The play was published in April, 2016 by Broadway Play Publishing Inc. Jericho His third play, Jericho, had a public staged reading at The Rattlestick Theatre in New York City on May 18, 2009. In October, 2010, The National New Play Network named Jericho,\\" a finalist in their annual National New Play Network Festival. It was read at their convention in Denver, Colorado on December 4, 2010 at the Curious Theatre. Following the reading in Denver, Jericho was signed by four theaters to take part in a National New Play Network \\"Rolling World Premiere.\\" Jericho premiered at the New Jersey Repertory Theatre in Long Branch, New Jersey on October 13th, 2011. It received generally highly positive reviews, with the New York Times stating \\"Mr. Canfora has delivered a smart, hard- hitting drama filled with biting wit.\\" The Newark Star Ledger wrote \\"Canfora‚Äôs dialogue shows a true writer at work.\\" Its subsequent productions were at the Phoenix Theatre in Indianapolis in late October, 2011. The Indianapolis Star wrote that \\"The twisting journey to Jericho is worth it.\\" The Florida Studio Theatre production opened April 4, 2012 and ran through June 9 as part of the 2011-2012 Mainstage Season. The play was also named to the Orlando Shakespeare Festival's prestigious \\"Playfest\\" reading series in April, 2011.'' The play ran Off Broadway at 59E59 Theaters from October, 4th, 2013, to November 3, 2013. It starred Jill Eikenberry and received strong review. The New York Times praised it especially, calling it \\"painfully significant, an intelligent intertwining of the nature of grief, cultural identity, fraught relationships and shared tragedy.\\" It ran in Minnesota in April, 2015 and called \\"Brilliant\\" by the Star-Tribune It was published by Broadway Play Publishing Inc. in November, 2012. It is now in its second printing. == \\"The Small Time\\"== In 2015, Canfora co-created the web series \\"The Small Time,\\" about a hapless literary agent whose only successful clients are his parents. The pilot was released in September, 2015 and won numerous honors, including a Webby Award in 2016 for \\"Best Writing.\\" ==Acoustic duo== Canfora occasionally performs as a singer and guitarist in the acoustic duo \\"Canfora & Koenig\\" with Rob Koenig. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Canfora & Koenig * Website about A World With Snow * Website about \\"Place Setting\\" * Website about Place Setting * Website for Jack Canfora * Website for Canfora and Koenig * Nytimes.com * Nj.com * Curtainup.com * Talkinbroadway.com * Njrep.org * Theatermania.com * Nnpn.org * Nyrep.org * Blog.nj.com * Theater2.nytimes.com * Jerseyshorenow.com * Newyorkcool.com * Theater2.nytimes.com * Nj.com * Florida Studio Theatre Production of Jericho * Category:1969 births Category:Living people Category:20th-century American dramatists and playwrights ","title":"Jack Canfora"},{"id":"5598697","text":"Kidatu Dam, also Kidadu Hydroelectric Power Sation is a hydroelectric dam in Tanzania. ==Location== The power station is located across the Great Ruaha River, in the village of Kilosa, in Morogoro Region, approximately , by road, southwest of Dar es Salaam, the commercial capital and largest city of Tanzania.

Founded in 1851, it is a non-profit non-trading entity owned and managed by its members according to the business model of a cooperative. ==History== Composers Ernest Bourget, Victor Parizot and Paul Henrion in Paris in 1847 (see 1847 in music) succeeded in having payment made for their works which were being played in the leading caf√©-concert at the time, Les Ambassadeurs. The French courts recognized these legitimate rights founded in revolutionary laws. The provisional union of authors, composers and publishers of music was thus established in 1850, and one year later, the professional union became a society (soci√©t√© civile) of authors, composers, and publishers who divided the author‚Äôs rights collected amongst the members, and this rule has been maintained to the present day. SACEM first had 350 members when it was founded in the 1850s, distributed between authors, composers and publishers of music. This period was marked by the start of the urban revolution, the growth of metropolises and the progression and multiplication of caf√©-concerts. A century after SACEM‚Äôs foundation, the number of its members was multiplied by 170. In 1963, SACEM developed cultural action to aid musical creation, the dissemination of works and integration of young professionals.

Pammachius became a monk, that is, put on a religious habit and gave himself up to works of charity. After his wife's death he built a hospice for poor strangers. ==Biography== Pammachius was born to a noble Roman family. In youth he frequented the schools of rhetoric with St. Jerome, and in 385 he married Paulina, second daughter of St. Paula. He was probably among the viri genere optimi religione pr√¶clari, who in 390 denounced Jovinian to Pope St. Siricius.See Ambrose, Ep. xli. When he attacked St. Jerome's book against Jovinian for prudential reasons, Jerome wrote him two letters thanking him; the first, vindicating the book, was probably intended for publication.These two letters are Jerome's Epp. xlviii and xlix. On Paulina's death in 397, Pammachius became a monk, that is, put on a religious habit and gave himself up to works of charity.See Jerome, Ep. lxvi and Paulinus of Nola, Ep. xiii. In 399 Pammachius and Oceanus wrote to St. Jerome asking him to translate Origen's De Principiis, and repudiate the insinuation of Rufinus that St. Jerome was of one mind with himself with regard to Origen. St. Jerome replied the following year.See Jerome, Epp. lxxxiii‚Äìiv. In 401 Pammachius was thanked by St. Augustine for a letter he wrote to the people of Numidia, where he owned property, exhorting them to abandon the Donatist schism.See Augustine, Ep. lviii. Many of St. Jerome's commentaries on Scripture were dedicated to Pammachius. After his wife's death Pammachius built in conjunction with St. Fabiola a hospice at Porto, at the mouth of the Tiber opposite Ostia, for poor strangers.See Jerome, Epp. lxvi, lxxvii. The site has been excavated, and the excavations have disclosed the plan and the arrangement of this only building of its kind. Rooms and halls for the sick and poor were grouped around it.Frothingham, The Monuments of Christian Rome, p. 49 The church of Santi Giovanni e Paolo in Rome was founded either by Pammachius or his father.

He was also a pipemaker, and the pipes he made with Fred Picknell include several important innovations, and have a distinctive tone. He had studied the instrument with the noted piper Thomas Todd, and from his own father Henry Clough. His three surviving recordings, among the earliest recordings made of the instrument, and his considerable body of music manuscripts, including his own compositions, give considerable insight into the traditional playing technique and style of the instrument. This is particularly so because at least four previous generations of the family had been pipers, as was his son 'Young Tom' (1912‚Äì1987) ‚Äì they thus form a continuous link between earliest players of the modern instrument, and contemporary players. In contrast to the widely accepted notion of traditional folk music as an essentially rural activity, he and his family lived in the mining community of Newsham in south-east Northumberland, and were miners themselves. At the end of his life, \\"Young Tom\\" recalled piping sessions at the 'Willow Tree' in Newsham, with his father Tom, grandfather Henry Clough, and Richard Mowat all playing ‚Äì Henry's and Richard Mowat's playing would get more furious and inaccurate as the evening progressed; Tom was teetotal. Young Tom had the job of carrying his grandfather's pipes afterwards. There is a composite photograph of the Clough family at. Here Tom himself is on the left, his pipemaking collaborator Fred Picknell standing behind him, his father Henry Clough and son 'Young Tom' standing towards the right, while an older image of Tom's grandfather \\"Old Tom\\", seated piping in the foreground, has been added subsequently. Old Tom died in 1885, and the main photograph was taken in 1924. The other figure, seated on the far right, is believed to be Captain Nicholson of Haydon Bridge, a traditional fiddler. ==The Family== The family can be traced back to before 1800 ‚Äì tracing them is made somewhat easier as they maintained a naming pattern where the names Thomas and Henry recur in successive generations. To distinguish people with the same name, they are numbered consecutively. The earliest known piping member of the family was Tom (I) (c. 1760-18??). According to his descendant Tom (III), Tom (I) was present, perhaps as a participant, at a competition in Elsdon in 1800 when young William Lamshaw beat James Allan. Miners often moved at this time in search of work, and tracing the family this early has been difficult. Some of the moves seem to correspond to the sinking of new pit shafts, and the family may at this time have specialised in this skill, perhaps accounting for their relative wealth. A remark of Tom (III) suggests Tom (I)'s son James was also a piper, though there is little direct evidence of this. James had a son Henry (I) (1789‚Äì1842). It is known that Henry (I) played Northumbrian pipes, as well as a set of Pastoral pipes, whose drones survive to this day. Henry is the named composer of some of the variation sets which survive in the manuscripts compiled by Tom (III). He is said to have known the piper Young William Lamshaw; this was perhaps as a pupil, for Lamshaw died in 1806, when Henry was only 17. One of Henry (I)'s younger sons Tom (II) (1828‚Äì1885), known as 'Old Tom' is the first of the family whom we know much about. He was resident in Newsham, and hired as a sinker when the Cowpen \\"C\\", or \\"Isabella\\" pit was sunk in 1849, and gave his occupation as pitman when he married in 1850. He was also, nearer the end of his life, after the pit where he worked was laid idle, the landlord of The Willow Tree, then the only public house in Newsham. A hornpipe, The Willow Tree, by Tom (II), is still widely played among pipers. Tom (II) learned the pipes, not from his father, but from George Nicholson, of Blyth, and from Thomas Hair. In later life he won several competitions, in particular those organised by the Society of Antiquaries in Newcastle Town Hall in 1877, 1878 and 1879 ‚Äì the first prize in these was the substantial sum of 10 guineas. After his third victory, he won, outright, a fine silver cup which is now in the Morpeth Chantry Museum. He was debarred from competing subsequently, but continued to attend and play. He died in June 1885, and had a substantial obituary, of one and a half columns, in the following week's Morpeth Herald. This confirms that he was a sinker of pit shafts, as others of the family are believed to have been, and lists his piping achievements, as well stating that he won trophies and cash prizes (¬£50 on one occasion) for shooting. The family must have been affluent at this time, as his grave is marked with a fine Cheviot granite tombstone, which still stands.Obituary, The Morpeth Herald, p. 2, 4 July 1885. Tom (II) had a son, Henry (II) (1855‚Äì1936). He is the first member of the family known to have written tunes down, and a tune book of his survives. On several occasions, including once in 1905, Henry and his son, Tom (III), were invited to play at Alnwick Castle on the occasion of a royal visit. Henry (II) and his younger brother James (1861‚Äì?) were both pipers, and competed, at first in the beginners' class, from 1879 onwards. Henry's brother James seems not to have played the pipes in public later in life. He may be the James Clough who became manager of the Barrington Colliery at Bedlington, and if so, the pressure of that job may have meant he had less time for piping. Henry was a contemporary of Richard Mowat, and during the 1880s and 1890s often came second to him in competition. In 1899, Henry won a competition run by the Northumberland Smallpipes Society, with a prize of a gold medal. That society dissolved shortly after this event, however. After the Northumbrian Pipers' Society was founded in 1928, Henry was elected as one of the Vice-Presidents. Henry's son Tom (III) (1881‚Äì1964), the main subject of this article, is notable for several reasons. He studied with Thomas Todd, having first learned the basics of the instrument practicing in the house of a neighbour, in secret from his father, on borrowed pipes. He first entered a competition in 1894, winning the learners' class, and placing third in the Open the following year, behind Richard Mowat and his father. He was married in 1905, to Ann (Nancy) Dobinson. There is a story that he proposed when he realised the bead and cane curtain in her parents' house provided ideal raw material for reed making. One old drone reed in the set of pipes formerly belonging to his son 'Young Tom' Clough (IV) does indeed have a residue of black paint. He became friendly with figures who were active in the folk music revival, notably Cecil Sharp, William Cocks in Northumberland, the composer and musicologist William G. Whittaker and the graphic artist Stanley Kennedy North, an active member of the Musical Association, and himself a piper. Kennedy North's influence was probably crucial in arranging Tom's recordings, his performances at concerts in London, his broadcasts for the BBC, and a folk music tour of Germany and the Netherlands. Kennedy North also made very precise fair copies of some variation sets from Tom's repertoire, apparently in preparation for publication. These, together with Tom's own extensive manuscripts, give a detailed picture of his repertoire, while his three recordings give a good insight into his style. Tom became deaf from the late 1940s onwards, partly as a result of a bomb which destroyed his house in 1940, but perhaps also due to hearing damage from working with explosives in the mine; though he had worked initially below ground, he subsequently worked on the surface in the explosive store. He was less and less able to play from about 1950 until his death. It is known from Eddie Jackson that Clough also played the fiddle in the 1940s ‚Äì Eddie was a neighbour at this time. There is no early evidence of him as a fiddler, so this may have been in part a response to his hearing loss. Tom (III)'s son, \\"Young Tom\\" (IV) (1912‚Äì1987) learned to play at first from his grandfather Henry, then his father. He played only rarely in later life, but towards the end of his life met Chris Ormston on several occasions. His playing style was similar to that of his father, and he was able to explain details of this, and to confirm some conclusions Chris Ormston had reached from study of Tom (III)'s recordings. He commented of Ormston's playing, \\"me fyether would've liked you\\". ==The recordings, and playing style== In 1929, HMV issued a recording of Tom (III) playing three pieces ‚Äì Elsey Marley, The Keel Row and Holey Ha'penny. The first is a simple song tune in jig time, the latter two are elaborate variation sets. This recording is currently available on The Northumbrian Smallpipes (Topic TSCD487); The Keel Row may be listened to online on Soundcloud Tom Clough 1929, while \\"Elsie Marley\\" and \\"Holey Ha'penny\\" are at Tom Clough 1929 ‚Äì re-mastered Ho'ley Ha'penny-Elsie Marley. The pieces, especially the variation sets, are played in a highly ornate style, and what is significant about the technique, apart from his great skill, is the total lack of open-fingered or slurred notes. The chanter is closed, and hence silent briefly, between any pair of notes. This forms a great contrast with the style of Billy Pigg, which was distinguished by his use of open-fingered ornamentation. Tom felt, on the other hand, that open fingering was \\"a grievous error in smallpipe playing\\". This \\"error\\" persists: Young Tom once commented \\"Nowadays they play with half their hand off the chanter.\\" Chris Ormston, who knew \\"Young Tom\\" for a few months before his death, is a respected modern piper who consistently uses and advocates the \\"Clough\\" style. One other recording is known to have been made by Tom (III), late in his life, when his deafness was severe. This was made by Colin Ross and Forster Charlton, of Tom playing his variations on Nae Guid luck; while this recording was used to transcribe the piece for the Pipers' Society Tunebook, it was apparently not kept, as it was felt that it would not be fair on Tom to retain it. In 1929, as well as making three recordings for HMV, he also travelled to The Hague and Cologne with a group of singers; the trip was organised by the International Society for Contemporary Music, the Nederland-England Society and the Folk-song Society. The group also made a radio broadcast from Cologne. ==His teaching== Tom Clough was an influential teacher of the pipes, though at an advanced level: his pupil Tommy Breckons recalled learning first from G.G. Armstrong, and then from Tom Clough: \\"Now as to the difference between Tom and George. Tom wouldn't have been much use to a novice piper.... But George had a gift for teaching a novice. He could show you how to do things. I don't quite know how he did it!.\\"Some memories, Tommy Breckons, Northumbrian Pipers' Society Magazine, v. 18, 1997 He described Tom Clough's set of exercises, which he said were similar to G.G. Armstrong's ‚Äì Armstrong had learned from the Clough family. These exercises consisted of scales and arpeggios ‚Äì the pupil would have to start slowly, and increase speed till mistakes happened. Another group of exercises, based on variation sets, are all found in the four tunes Fenwick of Bywell, Jacky Layton, Felton Lonnen and Oh dear, what can the matter be. He also gave a description of Tom Clough's meticulous teaching technique: \\"He made you break a tune down and play it bar by bar. If there was a bar bothering you, you played that bar until you got it right. Then you put the bars together, then put the measure together, and then eventually the tune together. Finally you could start at the beginning and go through it.\\" Tommy Breckons also recalled his friend Billy Pigg's recollection of playing at a regular session at Tom Clough's: When he lived at Blagdon, he used to bike down to Clough's. There were fourteen or fifteen pipers all living in that area, and they took turns to play at each other's houses, including Billy's. Billy told me that when he first went to one of these sessions there were fourteen pipers in the house, \\"...and everyone was better than me! By God..., there were some good pipers. But all I had to dee was practice and get up alongside them.\\" == The manuscripts == A book on the family and their music,The Clough Family of Newsham, Northumbrian Pipers' Society, ed. Chris Ormston and Julia Say (2000) was published by the Northumbrian Pipers' Society in 2000. This has become a significant source for players of the instrument. It contains a short biography, selections from Tom Clough's writings, a description of his playing style, transcriptions of the three recordings, and selections from his music manuscripts. These include his extensive collection of variation sets. Of these, some are distinctive versions of traditional variation sets, such as I saw my love come passing by me, other sets are his own compositions such as the variations on The tailors are aal gyen styen blind. Others are his adaptations, to Northumbrian pipes, of sets composed for other instruments such as the fiddle. Some of the versions are very old ‚Äì for instance, the triple-time hornpipe Lads of Alnwick, here with 5 strains, is almost identical to William Dixon's version from the 1730s, while the commonly played 19th century version omits the final strain. Comparison of the recordings of The Keel Row and Holey Ha'penny with his manuscripts of the same pieces, and his notes on how to play them, suggests that most of the pieces in his huge repertoire were played much more floridly than he notated them. Unfortunately, by the time portable tape recording became available in the 1950s, he had largely given up playing owing to severe deafness. However, the three surviving HMV recordings are a testament both to his virtuosity and to the expressive power of the traditional close-fingered style. ==Pipemaking== From about 1911 until 1943, Clough was, both alone and in collaboration with others, particularly Fred Picknell, a prolific maker of Northumbrian pipes. The earliest dateable reference to anybody buying a Clough chanter is from 1911, while Clough generally played a chanter by Picknell, which he used playing for King Edward in 1906. Picknell died in 1943, and Clough's house was bombed in the same year and his lathe stolen ‚Äì as pieces of pipes he was working on were also stolen, he must still have been an active pipemaker until this time. Clough also made reeds ‚Äì there is a tradition that he made drone reeds from pieces of a bead curtain from the home of his wife Nancy's parents. This is corroborated by many of his surviving drone reeds having been previously painted black, including some in a set belonging to 'Young Tom', now in the possession of Chris Ormston. While those pipes Clough made on his own have been described as rough in their workmanship, those he made in collaboration with Picknell, a colliery blacksmith, are relatively fine and delicate. In 1933, William Cocks wroteThe Northumbrian Bagpipes: Their Development and Makers, William A. Cocks, Northumbrian Pipers' Society, 1933. that F. Picknell's pipes and chanters are unmarked, and of very good clean workmanship. As there is no evidence Picknell played the pipes himself, it would make sense for him to collaborate with Clough, considered the best piper of his age. The piper and pipemaker Andy May, who has studied many of their surviving complete sets and chanters, has written,The Pipemaking of Tom Clough and Fred Picknell, Andy May, Journal of the Northumbrian Pipers' Society, v.32, 2011. that they were the most prolific makers of extended-range chanters between James Reid who died in 1874, and Bill Hedworth who began making them in the 1950s. In particular, they extended the range further, down to low A, and in at least one case low G. The latter chanter has the keys for low G, B and A mounted from left to right in a single block, and May believes this is the first chanter made with a range down to low G, and the first use of such a triple key block. Young Tom Clough believed much of the work developing such chanters was done during the General Strike of 1926. Other innovations in the extended Clough/Picknell chanters are that the pairing of keys is different from that of the Reids' chanters, and that the lower holes are sited significantly lower down the chanter than on comparable Reid instruments, improving the intonation for these notes, and making the instrument easier to reed. There is a newspaper photograph of Tom playing on pipes with an extended chanter at. ==References== Category:1964 deaths Category:1881 births Category:English folk musicians Category:Players of Northumbrian smallpipes Category:Musicians from Northumberland ","title":"Tom Clough"},{"id":"5598733","text":"Anthony Michael Vincent Coombs (born 18 November 1952) is a Conservative Party politician in the United Kingdom and a company director. ==Early life== Coombs was educated at Charterhouse School and Worcester College, Oxford. ==Political career== Coombs was a Councillor on the Birmingham City Council between 1978‚Äì88.

The power station is reported to generate the electricity with zero carbon dioxide emission. The Tanzanian electricity utility monopoly Tanesco operates the power station on behalf of the government of Tanzania. ==Location== The power station is located across the Kilombero River at the southern end of the Kihansi Gorge before the convergence with the Ulanga River in Tanzania, approximately , by road, southwest of Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania's largest city. This is approximately , by road, south of Iringa, the nearest large town. The geographical coordinates of the power station are:08¬∞34'30.0\\"S, 35¬∞51'05.0\\"E (Latitude:-8.575000; Longitude:35.851389). ==Overview== The Kihansi Dam is a concrete gravity dam owned by the Tanzania Electric Supply Company Limited. Its construction began in July 1995 and was opened by President Benjamin W. Mkapa on 10 July 2000. It cost $275 million to construct. Its installed capacity is 180 megawatts and it provided approximately 13 percent of the total electrical power in Tanzania, at the time it was commissioned. ==Technical details== The concrete dam measures in height and in length. The resultant reservoir can store a total of of water, creating a lake with a surface area of , when full. The river drops approximately in the Kihansi Gorge over a distance of about . The turbines use that gradient to generate power in an underground power station, and return the water to the river about downstream. ==Environmental impact== The Kihansi Dam destroyed an 800m-high waterfall, affected over 20,000 villagers, and was directly responsible for the extinction in the wild of the Kihansi Spray Toad. The dam reduced the amount of silt and water coming down from the waterfall into the gorge by 90 percent. This led to the spray toad's microhabitat being compromised, as it reduced the amount of water spray, which the toads were directly reliant on for oxygen. This also meant that the toad may have been more susceptible to a chytrid fungus, which was believed to have been transported to the area by conservationists' boots. This chytridiomycosis, which in 2003 was confirmed to be in dead animals of the species, was possibly responsible for the sudden population crash after the world's largest sprinkler system was installed in that area in August 2003. This system was installed to try and conserve the toad species from becoming extinct in the wild, but did not succeed. ==See also== *List of hydropower stations in Africa *List of power stations in Tanzania ==ReferencesExternal links== *Tanesco Official Website Category:Dams completed in 2000 Category:Energy infrastructure completed in 2000 Category:Dams in Tanzania Category:Hydroelectric power stations in Tanzania Category:Buildings and structures in the Morogoro Region ","title":"Kihansi Hydroelectric Power Station"},{"id":"5598775","text":"Map of Kikinda municipality, showing location of the village Banatska Topola () is a village in the Kikinda municipality, in the North Banat District of the Republic of Serbia. It is situated in the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina. The village has a population of 1,066 (2002 census) of which 570 (53.47%) are ethnic Serbs and 434 (40.71%) are ethnic Hungarians. The location of the village is 18 kilometers south of the city of Kikinda. Administratively, the settlement named Vincaid is also classified as part of Banatska Topola. ==Name== In Serbian, the village is known as –ë–∞–Ω–∞—Ç—Å–∫–∞ –¢–æ–ø–æ–ª–∞ or Banatska Topola, in Hungarian as T√∂r√∂ktopolya, and in German as Banat Topola. ==History== There are numerous archaeological findings which are pointing to human presence in this area in the late Bronze Age, around 1200 B.C. Accidental findings of Bronze Age tools are kept in the Kikinda National Museum. Other findings provide evidence of the presence of Sarmatians in later periods. During the Middle Ages there existed several settlements in the area of the present-day village. However, up to the second half of the 18th century, the land in this area was composed of wetlands and fens. The modern village was founded during Habsburg administration in 1766 by Serb frontiersmen, but they soon abandoned the area because of the flooding. In 1781-1783, the land was bought by Count Bogdan Kar√°csony from neighbouring Novo Milo≈°evo, who then started the process of drying up the wetlands. Around 1790, he founded the village in the middle of these wetlands, which he settled with German and Hungarian families. Until 1778, the area was part of a separate Habsburg province known as the Banat of Temeswar. After the abolishment of this province, in 1778, the area was included into the Torontal County within the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary. In 1848-1849, the village was part of autonomous Serbian Vojvodina and in 1849-1860 part of the Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar, a separate Austrian crown land. It was part of the Batschka-Torontal District (1849-1850) and Gro√übetschkerek District (1850-1860) within the voivodeship. After the abolishment of the voivodeship in 1860, the village was again included into Torontal County. A Roman Catholic church was built in 1899. In 1910 census, main spoken language in the village was German and the second largest spoken language was Hungarian. In 1918, the village firstly became part of the Banat Republic, then (as part of the Banat, Baƒçka and Baranja region) part of the Kingdom of Serbia and finally part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later renamed to Yugoslavia). In 1918-1919, the village was part of the Banat, Baƒçka and Baranja region and also (from 1918 to 1922) part of the Veliki Beƒçkerek district. From 1922 to 1929, the village was part of the Belgrade Oblast and from 1929 to 1941 part of the Danube Banovina. According to 1931 data, main spoken language in the village was Hungarian and the second largest spoken language was German. From 1941 to 1944, the village was under Axis occupation and was part of the Banat autonomous region within German-occupied Serbia. Since 1944, the village is part of autonomous Yugoslav Vojvodina, which (from 1945) was part of new socialist Serbia within Yugoslavia. In 1944, as a consequence of World War II events in Yugoslavia, one part of Yugoslav citizens of German ethnicity left from the area, together with defeated German army. Those who remained in the area were sent to communist prison camps. After prison camps were dissolved (in 1948), most of the remaining German population left Yugoslavia in subsequent decades, mainly because of economic reasons. After World War II (in 1946), some (mainly ethnic Serb) families from Bosnia and Herzegovina settled in the village. Post-WW2 population censuses recorded Hungarian ethnic majority in the village. Since 1971 census, the village have a Serb majority. ==Historical population== *1948: 1,255 *1953: 1,029 *1961: 1,101 *1971: 1,848 *1981: 1,463 *1991: 1,176 *2002: 1,066 ==Gallery== Image:Banatska_Topola,_Catholic_Church.jpgThe Ascension of Blessed Virgin Mary Catholic Church under reconstruction ==See also== *List of places in Serbia *List of cities, towns and villages in Vojvodina == External links == * Primary School \\"Bratstvo-Jedinstvo\\" Category:Kikinda Category:Populated places in Serbian Banat Category:Populated places in North Banat District ","title":"Banatska Topola"},{"id":"5598793","text":"The Orange-2 Representative District is a one-member state Representative district in the U.S. state of Vermont.

He played as a striker, and is most notable for his time spent with Newcastle United. He was the first non-British-registered foreign player to become top scorer in England. ==Background== Robledo was born in Iquique, Chile to a Chilean father and an English mother. He emigrated with his family to Brampton, Yorkshire in 1932, at the age of five, due to the instability in Chile at the time. ==Club career== Robledo started his footballing career at Huddersfield Town, playing as a part-time amateur while he earned his money coal mining, though he never managed to break into the first team. He was able to give up the coal mining when he moved to Second Division Barnsley during World War II. First Division club Newcastle United signed him on 27 January 1949, for a fee of ¬£26,500. The fee included his brother Ted; this is because Newcastle were only interested in buying George but he refused to move without his brother. Robledo's league debut for Newcastle came in the 2‚Äì0 victory away to Charlton Athletic on 5 February, while his first league goal came a month later in the derby match against Sunderland at St James' Park. Newcastle came out of the match 2‚Äì1 winners, with Robledo's goal separating the sides, helping to quickly make him a fan favourite. The other Newcastle goal scorer was Jackie Milburn, marking the start of one of the great striking partnerships in Newcastle United's history. Robledo went on to score 5 more goals in the last 12 games of the season. The following season, Robledo scored 11 goals for Newcastle, then netted 14 times in the 1950‚Äì51 season and became the first South American to play in the FA Cup final, when Newcastle beat Blackpool 2‚Äì0 to lift the Cup. Robledo finished as Division One's top scorer in the 1951‚Äì52 season with 33 goals, 39 in all competitions (equalling Hughie Gallacher's record). Robledo finished the season by scoring the goal which defeated Arsenal in the FA Cup final, helping Newcastle lift the cup in successive seasons. The goal scored by Robledo was drawn by a young John Lennon, who included it in the artwork of his album Walls and Bridges in 1974. In the 1952‚Äì53 season, Robledo scored 18 times, taking his all time goals record for Newcastle to 91 and his league record to 82 (making him the highest scoring (non-Irish) overseas player in the English top flight, a record that was broken nearly half a century later by Dwight Yorke). At the end of the season, Ted Robledo was sold to Colo-Colo and George soon followed him, with Colo-Colo paying Newcastle ¬£25,000 for his services. Both brothers were highly popular in Chile, and George ended as top scorer in the Chilean league in 1953 and 1954, with 26 and 25 goals respectively. Robledo left Colo-Colo in 1958, and spent a year out of football, before signing for Club Deportivo O'Higgins where he played out the final years of his career, until his retirement in 1960. ==International career== Chile recruited Robledo for the 1950 FIFA World Cup, even though he spoke no Spanish. He made his debut in the opening group game against England (one of his opponents reputedly warned him after he'd hit the post \\"Steady, George, you're not playing for Newcastle now, you know\\") and scored in Chile's 5‚Äì2 victory over the United States. He was in the Chile squad for the 1955 and 1957 South American Championships, finishing as runners-up in the former tournament. He made thirty-one appearances for his national side, scoring eight goals over a period of seven years. ==Honours== Club ;Newcastle United *FA Cup: 1950‚Äì51, 1951‚Äì52 ;Colo-Colo *Primera Divisi√≥n de Chile: 1953, 1956 *Copa Chile: 1958 Individual awards *First Division top scorer: 1951‚Äì52 *Primera Divisi√≥n de Chile top scorer: 1953, 1954 ==Personal life== Robledo married in 1959, and later had a daughter. He finally retired from football in 1961 and took charge of the sports program in St Peter's school, Vi√±a del Mar, where he remained leading a quiet life until his death of a heart attack on 1 April 1989, just before his 63rd birthday. He was survived by his wife Gladys and daughter Elizabeth; Gladys, now in her eighties, is still living 30 years later.

Its installed capacity is . Thousands of people were displaced to build the dam. ==History== The Hale Dam is the oldest operation dam currently in the country. The Pangani river basin had been a source of power since the early colonial times for Tanganiyka. The lower Pangani power plant was established at Pangani Falls by a German company as early as 1936. With the growing Tanga region and the close proximity to Mombasa, the government decided to construct a new Hydro electric power plant in Hale. The plant began construction in 1961 and cost around ¬£5,000,000, which was the single largest investment into the country since the failed groundnut scheme. The power-plant became operational in November 1964. ==Overview== The Hale hydro electric Power Plant utilizes a natural fall of 70 meters. It is sited at Hale Township on the Segera‚ÄìTanga highway, 6 km from the Tanga ‚Äì Moshi junction at Segera. Water from the neighboring rivers is channeled and dropped 70 meters below the ground surface. The power-plant its self is based 76 meters below the surface. The underground power station generates power by two vertical units comprising Francis turbines and salient pole generators and has an installed capacity of . The plant has undergone heavy rehabilitation twice since its inauguration, in 1987 and 2009. The construction of the dam in the 1960s led to the displacement of about 12,000 people. However, after the establishment of the dam, with a big supply of water and fish, it attracted a large proportion of migrants from fishing communities. This has also led to the establishment of big urban settlements called Nyumba ya Mungu, with an estimated population of about 20,000 people in 2002. The growing population led to a lot of water conflicts. ==See also== *Tanesco ==ReferencesExternal links== *Tanesco Website Category:Pangani basin Category:Dams in Tanzania Category:Hydroelectric power stations in Tanzania Category:Buildings and structures in the Tanga Region ","title":"Hale Dam"},{"id":"5598826","text":"Incidental findings are previously undiagnosed medical or psychiatric conditions that are discovered unintentionally and during evaluation for a medical or psychiatric condition. Such findings may occur in a variety of settings, including routine medical care, during biomedical research, during post-mortem autopsy, or during genetic testing. a report by the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues on incidental findings ==Medical imaging== An incidentaloma is a tumor found by coincidence which is often benign and does not cause any clinically significant symptoms; however a small percentage do turn out to be malignant. Incidentalomas are common, with up to 7% of all patients over 60 harboring a benign growth, often of the adrenal gland, which is detected when diagnostic imaging is used for the analysis of unrelated symptoms. As 37% of patients receiving whole-body CT scan may have abnormal findings that need further evaluation and with the increase of \\"whole-body CT scanning\\" as part of health screening programs, the chance of finding incidentalomas is expected to increase. Neuroimaging Incidental findings in neuroimaging are common, with the prevalence of neoplastic incidental brain findings increasing with age. Even in healthy subjects acting as controls in research incidental findings are not rare. As most neuroimaging studies are performed in adults, less is known about the prevalence incidental findings in children. A study in 2017 in nearly 4000 children between 8 and 12 reported that approximately 1 in 200 children showed asymptomatic incidental findings that required clinical follow-up. Pituitary adenomas are tumors that occur in the pituitary gland, and account for about 15% of intracranial neoplasms. They often remain undiagnosed, and are often an incidental finding during autopsy.

As with medical imaging, the capacity to measure biologic information in the form of genetic variation may exceed the scientific understanding of what the findings mean. In 2013, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomic Working Group on Incidental Findings published preliminary guidelines for clinical laboratories that perform clinical exome and genome sequencing.

It is a systematic critique of Marxism. Baudrillard's thesis is that Karl Marx‚Äôs theory of historical materialism is too rooted in assumptions and values of political economy to provide a framework for radical action. The fault of Marxism is in prioritizing the very concepts that founded capital, e.g. necessity, value, and labor. For Baudrillard, Marx did not transcend political economy but merely saw its reverse or its ‚Äúmirror‚Äù side. Marxism merely strengthens political economy‚Äôs basic propositions, in particular the idea that self-creation is performed through productive, non-alienated labor. In Baudrillard‚Äôs words, ‚Äú[Marxism] convinces men that they are alienated by the sale of their labor power, thus censoring the much more radical hypothesis that they might be alienated as labor power.‚Äù Baudrillard proposes to liberate workers from their \\"labor value\\" and think in terms other than production. ==External links== *Jean Baudrillard, The Mirror of Production, trans.

He produced over 1,300 cartoons between 1915 and 1956 including the many Terrytoons cartoons. His studio's most famous character is Mighty Mouse, and also created Heckle & Jeckle, Gandy Goose and Dinky Duck. ==Biography== Early life Terry was raised in San Francisco and in 1904 he began working as a news photographer and began to draw cartoons for newspapers. He contributed, along with his brother, John, to a weekly comic strip about a dog titled \\"Alonzo\\" for the San Francisco Call. He later transferred to the New York Press, a newspaper in New York City. In 1914, Terry became interested in animation after seeing Winsor McCay's Gertie the Dinosaur. While still working for the newspaper, he made his first film, Little Herman, which he completed and sold to the Thanhouser film company of New Rochelle, New York in 1915. Later that year, he completed his second film, Down on the Phoney Farm. There is a story, perhaps apocryphal, that Terry attempted to sell his cartoon to a producer who made a small offer for the film. When Terry told him that the offer was less than his production costs, the producer supposedly replied, \\"I'd had paid more if you hadn't put those pictures on there!\\" J. R. Bray Studios In 1916, he began working at Bray Productions, directing and producing a series of eleven Farmer Al Falfa films. Before the end of the year, Terry left Bray, taking the rights to Farmer Al Falfa with him. Paul Terry Productions In 1917, Terry formed his own production company, \\"Paul Terry Productions\\" and produced nine more animated films, including one Farmer Al Falfa film. Terry closed his studio to join the United States Army and fought in World War I. After he was discharged from the army in 1919, he made a deal in 1920 to make the Aesop Fables series to screenwriter Howard Estabrook. Fables Pictures In 1920, Terry entered into a partnership with Amadee J. Van Beuren, and founded Fables Pictures. During this time, he began producing a series of Aesop's Film Fables as well as new Farmer Al Falfa films under that banner. Terry experimented with the sound process in a Fable Cartoon called Dinner Time after pressure from Van Beuren, released in September 1928, two months before Walt Disney's Steamboat Willie was released in November 1928. Terry's partnership with Van Beuren lasted until 1929, when Terry and Van Beuren disagreed over the switch to producing films with sound. Terry started up the Terrytoons studio in the \\"K\\" Building in downtown New Rochelle, New York, where the Thanhouser film company, purchasers of Terry's first films, was also located. Van Beuren retained \\"Fables Pictures\\" and renamed it \\"Van Beuren Studios\\". Terrytoons Terry's Terrytoons produced a large number of animated films, including Gandy Goose, Mighty Mouse, Heckle and Jeckle, and many other lesser-known characters. Theatrical distribution was at first through Educational Pictures and then, after it was acquired in 1937, through 20th Century Fox. One of his works produced during this time, called The Three Bears, gained internet fame almost 70 years later when one of its scenes became an Internet meme. Terry was quick to adopt techniques that simplified the animation process, but he resisted \\"improvements\\" that complicated production. He was one of the first to make use of \\"cel animation\\", including animation of separate body parts. His studio was slow to switch to synchronized sound tracks and to color. He managed to keep his studio profitable while others went out of business. Terry was once quoted as saying, \\"Walt Disney is the Tiffany's of the business, and I am the Woolworth's.\\" Retirement and legacy Terry became the first major cartoon producer to package his old films for television. In 1956, Terry sold his animation studio and film library to CBS for $3.5 million and retired. CBS appointed Gene Deitch, who replaced the old characters with new ones such as Clint Clobber and John Doormat. Deitch departed after three years. After Deitch's departure, Mighty Mouse and Heckle & Jeckle returned, as well as new characters such as Deputy Dawg. CBS made the Terrytoons library of films a mainstay of its Saturday morning programming and continued operating the studio, making both new theatrical films and series for television until the late 1960s. Death Terry died on October 25, 1971, aged 84, in New York City. His nephew, Alex Anderson, was also an animator. Terry's wife Irma preceded him in death in 1969 at age 70. Daughter Patricia Terry-Leahy, who survives them, has her father's cremated remains in her North Carolina home. ==ReferencesExternal links== * * Category:1887 births Category:1971 deaths Category:American cartoonists Category:American comics artists Category:Film producers from California Category:American animated film directors Category:American animated film producers Category:American male screenwriters Category:People from San Mateo, California Category:Disease-related deaths in New York (state) * Category:Film directors from California Category:Screenwriters from California Category:Bray Productions people Category:20th-century American male writers Category:20th-century American screenwriters ","title":"Paul Terry (cartoonist)"},{"id":"5598878","text":"The term strict refers to relational operators in mathematics.

Players capture and extract resources from these floating islands. Because the game runs in real-time, the game world continues to alter when players are logged out. All in-game enemies consist of other players, who must be repelled by force or prevented from attacking through diplomatic intervention. It was made free to play on August 19, 2009 and was closed down on July 28, 2010. ==Setting== Time of Defiance is set on a world called Nespanona, which one million years ago had a race called the Nespans living on it. The Nespans understood that all physics was just a side effect of actions at the quantum level, and using this knowledge were able to do many things that would seem impossible. They were interested in interstellar travel. They could already teleport objects but only relatively small objects, such as people. A scientist attempted to teleport larger objects to use on starships, however, a mathematical mistake caused him to begin the process of shrinking the entire planet's core. Although this would take years to complete, the effects on the planet's gravity would be fairly extreme, causing the planet's crust to fracture and fall. Faced with the situation, the Nespan attached thousands of anti-gravity engines to the underside of the crust, giving them time to evacuate the entire planet. As the crust began to collapse, the anti-gravity engines held parts of the crust in place creating islands floating above the ocean created by the watery moon being sucked into the core. Currently the remaining people haven't got the level of technology that the Nespan have, the most advanced being Quantam Foam Gates, relics of the Nespan. The Quantam Gates are controlled by the Eighth House, a neutral organization that acts like a marketplace selling rare ships and resources in exchange for the Crystal Moss. The Eighth House is engaged in a war with the Shadoo, and seems to encourage the Cog tribes to fight over the Northern Continent. Races in Time of Defiance The Cog are a clannish race with moderately primitive technology. Each individual Cog is a member of a specific clan, and the clans are dominated by the Eighth House. An Example of Cog technology is that all their ships run on coal as a fuel. The Cog are engaged in a war with the Shadoo, but it is war only fought by the Eighth House and few other Cog have even seen a real Shadoo. The Shadoo are a more technologically advanced race than the Cog. They are a more philosophical race than the energetic Cog, and their architecture reflects this. In the game the only way to acquire their ships is through transactions with the Eighth House, as no Shadoo are encountered in the game. There is little evidence to suggest the Shadoo appearing in the game in person as they have only been represented by their looted ships. The Nespan are even less encountered than the Shadoo, with only two of their units in the game. They seem to disturb the Eighth House, as the ships that are found do not resemble the relics they had expected. They were constructed recently, and are purchasable through the Eighth House or found scattered across the continent. ==Objective== The objective of the game is to colonise as many islands as possible, to mine their resources - coal, stone, metal etc. These islands are scattered within a huge arena. Once gathered these resources enable players to build more assets. Meanwhile, other players are doing the same thing, which can lead to alliances or enemies. The game seems to require total commitment of its players if they hope to make headway. ==Reception== At the time of release, the game received \\"average\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Time of Defiance Homepage * Time of Defiance v5.621.0 Client * Category:2002 video games Category:Massively multiplayer online games Category:Real-time strategy video games Category:Windows games Category:Windows-only games Category:Inactive massively multiplayer online games Category:Strategy First games Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom ","title":"Time of Defiance"},{"id":"5598902","text":"Annika Duckmark, in 2009 Annika Duckmark, (born 17 September 1971 in Bor√•s, V√§sterg√∂tland, Sweden) is a Swedish television presenter.

He worked his way through the Watford youth side and turned professional at the club in 2002. In 2007, he joined Stockport County and then Milton Keynes Dons on loan, before signing with the Dons permanently later in the year. He left the Dons after just a few months, and then signed with Stockport. In 2009, he transferred to Bristol Rovers, before leaving the club following a brief period on loan at Port Vale in 2011. He signed with Yeovil Town in July 2011, who were promoted out of League One via the play-offs in May 2013. He switched to Plymouth Argyle for a two-year spell in June 2013. He turned to acting in 2015. ==Association football career== Watford Blizzard started his career with Watford, signing his first professional contract in April 2002. He made his debut for the club against Norwich City on 24 April 2004 at Vicarage Road, scoring the consolation goal in a 2‚Äì1 defeat. This was enough to win him a new contract at the end of the season. After making a number of appearances in 2004‚Äì05, he signed a new deal in February 2005 that would keep him at the club until summer 2007. The following month he became a first-team regular when Aidy Boothroyd replaced Ray Lewington as manager. He started the 2005‚Äì06 season in the first-team, but contracted the Epstein‚ÄìBarr virus in late September and did not play a first-team game for Watford again. He returned to the bench for a single game, on 14 April 2006, wearing a goalkeeper's kit. With second choice goalkeeper Alec Chamberlain out ill, the semi-fit Blizzard took the substitute goalkeeper spot, having played the position as a child. Having made just one first-team appearance in 2006‚Äì07, Blizzard spent the second half of the season on loan at Stockport County and Milton Keynes Dons. He played in both of the \\"Dons\\" play-off games, which saw them lose 2‚Äì1 on aggregate to Shrewsbury Town. Milton Keynes Dons and Stockport County In May 2007, he signed a two-year deal with the MK Dons. However, on 8 August it was announced that Blizzard had left the Dons by mutual consent, after new boss Paul Ince was unimpressed with his pre-season performances. Two days later, Stockport confirmed Blizzard would be re-joining the club as a free agent. He helped County into the play-offs during his first season at Edgeley Park, but missed the final itself due to a hamstring injury. Bristol Rovers Despite there being reported interest from Championship clubs, Blizzard joined League One club Bristol Rovers on a free transfer in July 2009, having agreed the deal over a week earlier. He signed a three-year deal. Despite missing most of the pre-season due to suffering from influenza, he made his debut as a substitute in a 2‚Äì1 defeat to Leyton Orient on 8 August 2009. On 15 February 2010, he made a challenge on Charlton Athletic's Grant Basey that \\"Addicks\\" boss Phil Parkinson described as \\"one of the worst I've seen\\". Though at first there were concerns that he had broken Basey's leg, the resulting injury turned out to be ankle ligament damage. This came ten days after Blizzard had told that the media that he was frustrated with being left on the bench. He was a regular starter for the rest of the season. On 27 February 2010 he scored his first and only goal for Bristol Rovers against Colchester United. During the 2010‚Äì11 season, Blizzard lost his starting place in the \\"Pirates\\" first eleven, as new signing Wayne Brown came in and took his place. He gained his first start of the season in September, after Brown was ruled out with an ankle problem. Two months later manager Paul Trollope announced his intention to try to find a club for Blizzard to join on loan. In March 2011, he joined Port Vale on loan until the end of the season; this reunited him with Jim Gannon, his former boss at Stockport. His spell would last a matter of days however. Arriving on the 18th, he played in the 3‚Äì0 defeat to Accrington Stanley on the 19th, and returned to Rovers on the 21st after Gannon was sacked. He departed parent club Rovers by mutual consent in June 2011. Yeovil Town In July 2011, Blizzard joined Yeovil Town on a one-year contract. He scored his first goal for the club in the FA Cup, hitting a twenty-yard drive in a 3‚Äì0 win away to Hereford United. Seven days later, on 19 November, he scored in the 2‚Äì2 draw with nearby rivals Exeter City at Huish Park. After returning from a lengthy spell on the sidelines with injury, he scored in a 3‚Äì2 defeat at Carlisle United on 25 February. His next goal was in a 3‚Äì2 win at home to Chesterfield on 28 April. On 15 May, Blizzard was reported to be one of four players set to leave the club after rejecting manager Gary Johnson's offer of a new contract. However two days later it was announced that he had signed a new one-year deal with the club. Blizzard told BBC Somerset: \\"I've signed and there was never a point that I wasn't going to sign. I'm happy with the whole environment. That's why I'm willing to sign again.\\" He made 30 appearances in the 2012‚Äì13 campaign, though did not feature in the play-off final victory over Brentford which took the \\"Glovers\\" into the Championship. Blizzard was released by Yeovil at the end of the season along with Richard Hinds and Gavin Williams. Plymouth Argyle On 25 June 2013, Dominic agreed to sign a two-year deal with League Two club Plymouth Argyle. He scored his first goal for the club with an \\"impressive strike from long range\\" against Southend United in a 1‚Äì1 draw at Home Park on 11 January 2014. In total he made 31 appearances for the \\"Pilgrims\\" in the 2013‚Äì14 campaign as Plymouth posted a tenth-place finish. He made 31 league appearances in the 2014‚Äì15 season, scoring one goal in a 1‚Äì0 win over Luton Town at Kenilworth Road on 6 September. Argyle reached the play-offs, losing to Wycombe Wanderers at the semi-final stage. Blizzard was released by manager John Sheridan in May 2015. Blizzard has indicated that Sheridan's decision to release him was \\"a bit personal\\" but stated that he enjoyed his time as a Plymouth Argyle player. Playing style Blizzard could play anywhere across the midfield, though preferring a central role he could also play as an attacking or defensive midfielder. He had been described as a skilled passing footballer.

Bangura played for the Sierra Leone national team and is notable for having been the victim of human trafficking when he was a teenager and also the subject of a deportation case in the United Kingdom in 2007. ==Early life== Bangura was born and brought up in Freetown, Sierra Leone, and his father was the head of the Poro Secret Society, however he died when Alhassan was a young child. As he was the oldest in his family, custom dictated that he took over his father's place in Poro, when he grew up. He refused to do so, and instead fled to Guinea aged just 15 years-old, saying later, \\"I didn't like it at all so I fled to Guinea\\". However, in Guinea he met a Frenchman, who he did not realise was involved in human trafficking and who took Bangura to France intending to make him a male prostitute. When the man took Bangura to the UK, he intended again to use him as a prostitute, however Bangura sought asylum. ==Playing career== Club Discovered by a Watford scout playing for Chertsey Town Youth in 2004, Bangura joined the Hornets youth set-up, and made his debut in a 1‚Äì0 win over Stoke City at the Britannia Stadium in April 2005, coming on for the injured Gavin Mahon after 30 minutes. Bangura started the following game against West Ham United, on the final day of the 2004‚Äì05 season. In the 2005‚Äì06 season he was a regular in the Watford side, making 40 appearances in all competitions. His first goal for the Hornets, was a 90th- minute equaliser in a 2‚Äì2 draw against Derby County at Vicarage Road in March 2006. At the end of the season he won the club's Young Player of the year award. At the end of the 2005‚Äì06 Championship season Watford were promoted to the Premier League and Bangura was rewarded with a contract extension taking him through to the end of the 2008‚Äì09 season. The 2006‚Äì07 season saw Bangura make his Premier League debut as a 75th-minute substitute in a 1‚Äì2 home defeat to Manchester United. He made a total of 20 appearances, 16 of which were in the Premier League as Watford finished bottom of the table in 20th place and were relegated back to the Championship. He signed a new three-year contract with Watford in May 2007, but only made 10 appearances in the 2007‚Äì08 season. In the following season he made five appearances, before going out on loan for the remainder of the season to League One side Brighton & Hove Albion in March 2009. He made his debut for the Seagulls four days after signing in a 2‚Äì1 defeat to Leyton Orient at Brisbane Road. He made a total of six appearances for Brighton. At the end of the season he returned to Watford, but left the club by mutual consent. He was subsequently signed in August by Blackpool on a non-contract basis, and later the same day was an unused substitute in a 0‚Äì0 home draw with Derby County. He made his debut in August, in the Seasiders' 4‚Äì1 victory over Premier League side Wigan Athletic in the second round of the 2009‚Äì10 Football League Cup. His league debut came two days later when he was an 80th-minute substitute in a 3‚Äì0 home win over Coventry City. In September 2009 he signed a one-year contract with an option for a further year with the Seasiders. After three substitute appearances his first league start came in a 3‚Äì0 win at home over Sheffield United in October. He was released at the end of the season. In 2011, he signed for Tony Adams' Gabala in Azerbaijan. On 1 July 2011, Bangura signed for Forest Green Rovers on a two-year contract, linking up with his former youth coach at Watford, Dave Hockaday, who was then manager at Forest Green. He picked up a knee injury later in the month whilst training and was required to undergo surgery which led to him missing the start of Rovers season. Bangura made his return from injury by featuring in a reserve team game against Brighton & Hove Albion in September 2011 and made his first team debut in a 3-2 home loss against Southport on 17 September 2011. Bangura then suffered another knee injury which led to him having a second operation in just four months to correct it. On 6 December 2012, Bangura extended his contract with Forest Green for a further two years, keeping him at the club until June 2015. However, in August 2014, he agreed to terminate his contract a year early and left the club. Following the appointment of former Forest Green Rovers manager Dave Hockaday as under-21 manager at Coventry City, Al Bangura joined the League One side on a trial basis in February 2015. Bangura impressed new Sky Blues boss Tony Mowbray to the extent that he was rewarded with a short-term deal to join the club until the end of the season. Bangura took time away from football after leaving Coventry City, however he returned to playing in January 2016. During his time away, he worked with the Premier League to raise awareness of the growing number of teenage players being tricked into leaving Africa for Europe. In January 2016, Bangura signed for National League South side St Albans City.http://nonleague.pitchero.com/news/former-hornet-joins-saints-44802/ A year later, Bangura joined National League North club Nuneaton Town. International Bangura was called up to the Sierra Leone squad by national manager Ahmed Kanu in October 2008. However, it was also revealed that he would not be able to play home matches in Sierra Leone, as he has said he feared his life would be in danger in the country he was forced to flee. He made his Leone Stars debut on 11 October in a 2010 FIFA World Cup and 2010 African Cup of Nations qualifier 4‚Äì1 defeat to Nigeria at the Abuja Stadium, Abuja, Nigeria. On 2 November 2009 he was called up for a friendly against Dutch Eredivisie side Willem II on 14 November, in aid of the Ibrahim Kargbo Foundation. Bangura played in the game which ended 1‚Äì1. ==Personal life== In September 2009 he moved from Watford to live on the Fylde Coast. Asylum case In early 2007 Bangura was cleared to stay in the UK. However, the Home Office lodged an appeal on a legal technicality, claiming his status as an asylum seeker changed when he turned 18 years old. In November 2007, Bangura appeared before an Asylum and Immigration Tribunal, with Watford manager Aidy Boothroyd speaking on his behalf. On 11 December 2007 he lost his case to stay in the UK, despite Bangura fearing a return to his homeland, where he could be under threat from the Soko tribe, formerly led by his late father. He launched an immediate appeal against the decision. The appeal against the decision, was backed by FIFPro, the worldwide representative organisation for professional footballers, Watford MP Claire Ward, Watford manager Aidy Boothroyd, former Home Secretary David Blunkett, and the club's honorary Life President Elton John. On 15 December 2007, Watford fans staged a half-time protest during the club's game against Plymouth Argyle, holding up posters on which Bangura's face appeared under the words \\"He's family\\", with Argyle fans in the 18,000 crowd joining in the protest. Four days later the Home Office announced that Bangura would be allowed to remain in the UK while he applied for a work permit, a process that would take place in parallel with his appeal against deportation back to Sierra Leone. Bangura won his appeal to stay in the UK after being awarded a work permit by a six-strong Government panel on 14 January 2008. At a Press Conference the following day Bangura said, \\"It's not the end of my career if I went back, It's the end of my life. It's going to make a big difference to my life. And, of course, I can concentrate more on my football now.\\". ==Career statistics== Club . {   center;\\" + Appearances and goals by club, season and competition - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Club !rowspan=\\"2\\"Season !colspan=\\"3\\"League !colspan=\\"2\\"National Cup !colspan=\\"2\\"League Cup !colspan=\\"2\\"Other !colspan=\\"2\\"Total - !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals - rowspan=\\"5\\" valign=\\"center\\"Watford 2005‚Äì06 Championship 3810000colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äì381 - 2006‚Äì07 Premier League 1600000colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äì160 - 2007‚Äì08 rowspan=\\"2\\" valign=\\"center\\"Championship 700000colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äì70 - 2008‚Äì09 200000colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äì20 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !63!!1!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!63!!1 - valign=\\"center\\"Brighton & Hove Albion (loan) 2008‚Äì09 League One 600000colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äì60 - valign=\\"center\\"Blackpool 2009‚Äì10 Championship 900020colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äì100 - valign=\\"center\\"Mersin ƒ∞dmanyurdu 2010‚Äì11 TFF First League 6000colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äìcolspan=\\"2\\"‚Äì50 - valign=\\"center\\"Gabala 2010‚Äì11 Azerbaijan Premier League 5000colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äìcolspan=\\"2\\"‚Äì50 - rowspan=\\"5\\" valign=\\"center\\"Forest Green Rovers 2011‚Äì12 rowspan=\\"4\\" valign=\\"center\\"Conference Premier 12010colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äì00130 - 2012‚Äì13 33020colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äì20370 - 2013‚Äì14 38010colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äì20410 - 2014‚Äì15 0000colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äì0000 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !83!!0!!4!!0!!colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äì!!4!!0!!91!!0 - valign=\\"center\\"Coventry City 2014‚Äì15 League One 0000000000 - valign=\\"center\\"St Albans City 2015‚Äì16 National League South 5000colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äì0050 - valign=\\"center\\"Nuneaton Town 2016‚Äì17 National League North 0000colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äì0000 - !colspan=\\"3\\"Career total !177!!1!!4!!0!!2!!0!!4!!0!!185!!1 } International . {  - !National team!!Year!!Apps!!Goals - rowspan=\\"2\\"Sierra Leone - 200810 - ! colspan=2Total!!1!!0 } ==Honours== Club ;Watford *Championship play-offs (1): 2005‚Äì06 ;Blackpool *Championship play-offs (1): 2009‚Äì10 ==ReferencesExternal links== * * *Al Bangura player profile at blackpoolfc.co.uk * Category:1988 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Freetown Category:Sierra Leonean footballers Category:Sierra Leone international footballers Category:Sierra Leonean expatriate footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:Watford F.C. players Category:Brighton & Hove Albion F.C. players Category:Blackpool F.C. players Category:Mersin ƒ∞dman Yurdu footballers Category:Gabala FC players Category:Forest Green Rovers F.C. players Category:Coventry City F.C. players Category:St Albans City F.C. players Category:Nuneaton Borough F.C. players Category:Premier League players Category:English Football League players Category:National League (English football) players Category:Temne people Category:Expatriate footballers in Azerbaijan Category:Expatriate footballers in England Category:Expatriate footballers in Turkey Category:Sierra Leonean expatriate sportspeople in Turkey ","title":"Al Bangura"},{"id":"5598929","text":"Occult blood may refer to: *Fecal occult blood, blood present in the feces that is not visibly apparent *Hematuria, the presence of red blood cells in the urine ","title":"Occult blood"},{"id":"5598930","text":"An inexact differential or imperfect differential is a specific type of differential used in thermodynamics to express the path dependence of a particular differential. It is contrasted with the concept of the exact differential in calculus, which can be expressed as the gradient of another function and is therefore path independent. Consequently, an inexact differential cannot be expressed in terms of its antiderivative for the purpose of integral calculations; i.e. its value cannot be inferred just by looking at the initial and final states of a given system. It is primarily used in calculations involving heat and work because they are path functions, not state functions. == Definition == An inexact differential is commonly defined as a differential form dx where there is no corresponding function x such that: x = \\\\int \\\\text{d}x \\\\,. More precisely, an inexact differential is a differential form that cannot be expressed as the differential of a function. In the language of calculus, for a given vector field F, \\\\delta f = F \\\\, \\\\text{d}r is an inexact differential if there is no function f such that : F = abla f The fundamental theorem of calculus for line integrals requires path independence in order to express the values of a given vector field in terms of the partial derivatives of another function that is the multivariate analogue of the antiderivative. This is because there can be no unique representation of an antiderivative for inexact differentials since their variation is inconsistent along different paths. This stipulation of path independence is a necessary addendum to the fundamental theorem of calculus because in one-dimensional calculus there is only one path in between two points defined by a function. == First law of thermodynamics == Inexact differentials are known especially for their presence in the first law of thermodynamics: :\\\\mathrm{d}U = \\\\delta Q + \\\\delta W Instead of the differential symbol d, the symbol Œ¥ is used instead, a convention which originated in the 19th century work of German mathematician Carl Gottfried Neumann, indicating that Q (heat) and W (work) are path-dependent, while U (internal energy) is not. Internal energy U is a state function, meaning its change can be inferred just by comparing two different states of the system (not its transition path), which we can therefore indicate with U1 and U2. Since we can go from state U1 to state U2 either by providing heat Q = U2 ‚àí U1 or work W = U2 ‚àí U1, such a change of state does not identify uniquely the values of provided W and Q, but only the change in internal energy ŒîU. == Examples == Although difficult to express mathematically, the inexact differential is very simple conceptually. There are many everyday examples that are much more relevant to inexact differentials in the actual context in which it is used. Total distance The easiest example is the difference between net distance and total distance. For example, in walking from Point A to Point B along a straight line, one covers a net distance B ‚àí A that is equal to the total distance. If one then returns to Point A, however, net distance is now 0 while total distance covered is 2*(B ‚àí A). This example captures the essential idea behind the inexact differential in one dimension. Precisely, the differential of net distance is simply the exact one form \\\\text{d}f = 1 \\\\, \\\\text{d}x with corresponding function \\\\Delta f = x_\\\\text{B} - x_\\\\text{A} . It is exact because 1 has antiderivative x everywhere on the real line. On the other hand, the differential of total distance is the inexact one form \\\\delta g = \\\\sgn(x) \\\\text{d}x (i.e. the sign function). It is inexact because sgn(x) has antiderivative x which is not differentiable at x = 0. Therefore \\\\Delta g e x_\\\\text{B} - x_\\\\text{A} and instead we must look at the path dependence. In our example, in the first leg of the journey, sgn(dx) is 1 since x is increasing. In the second leg, sgn(dx) is ‚àí1 since x is decreasing. We can then evaluate the total distance as: :\\\\Delta g = \\\\int_A^B \\\\text{d}x + \\\\int_B^A (-\\\\text{d}x) = 2 \\\\int_A^B \\\\text{d}x = 2(B-A) Heat and work A fire requires heat, fuel, and an oxidizing agent. The energy required to overcome the activation energy barrier for combustion is transferred as heat into the system, resulting in changes to the system‚Äôs internal energy. In a process, the energy input to start a fire may comprise both work and heat, such as when one rubs tinder (work) and experiences friction (heat) to start a fire. The ensuing combustion is highly exothermic, which releases heat. The overall change in internal energy does not reveal the mode of energy transfer and quantifies only the net work and heat. The difference between initial and final states of the system‚Äôs internal energy does not account for the extent of the energy interactions transpired. Therefore, internal energy is a state function (i.e. exact differential), while heat and work are path functions (i.e. inexact differentials) because integration must account for the path taken. == Integrating factors == It is sometimes possible to convert an inexact differential into an exact one by means of an integrating factor. The most common example of this in thermodynamics is the definition of entropy: :\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\,S = \\\\frac{\\\\delta Q_\\\\text{rev}}{T} In this case, Œ¥Q is an inexact differential, because its effect on the state of the system can be compensated by Œ¥W. However, when divided by the absolute temperature and when the exchange occurs at reversible conditions (therefore the rev subscript), it produces an exact differential: the entropy S is also a state function. ==See also== *Closed and exact differential forms for a higher-level treatment *Differential (mathematics) *Exact differential *Exact differential equation *Integrating factor for solving non-exact differential equations by making them exact *Conservative vector field ==ReferencesExternal links== *Inexact Differential ‚Äì from Wolfram MathWorld *Exact and Inexact Differentials ‚Äì University of Arizona *Exact and Inexact Differentials ‚Äì University of Texas *Exact Differential ‚Äì from Wolfram MathWorld Category:Thermodynamics Category:Multivariable calculus ","title":"Inexact differential"},{"id":"5598932","text":"Toumani Diagouraga (born 10 June 1987) is a French professional footballer who plays for Morecambe as a defensive midfielder. He began his career at Watford and played for Hereford United and Peterborough United, before rising to prominence with Brentford whom he joined in 2010. He has been described as a midfielder who \\"can keep the shape and pick up the second ball\\". He is nicknamed \\"Toums\\". == Career ==  Watford   2004‚Äì2006  Diagouraga was born in Paris to Malian parents and began his career in youth football in the city. He subsequently suffered a broken shoulder in a traffic accident, but returned to football and was spotted in a trial match versus an academy team from English club Watford. After a number of further trial matches, he joined the Hornets' academy in December 2003. He signed a professional contract in November 2004 at age 17 and starred in the youth team's run to the quarter finals of the 2004‚Äì05 FA Youth Cup. His performances during the run attracted transfer interest from Premier League club Chelsea. Diagouraga received his maiden call-up to the first team for the first game of the 2005‚Äì06 season, when he was an unused substitute during a 2‚Äì1 Championship defeat at home to Preston North End. Diagouraga made his first team debut with a start in Watford's 2‚Äì1 League Cup second round victory over Wolverhampton Wanderers on 20 September 2005 and he was substituted after 75 minutes by Junior Osborne. He made his league debut on 17 December, starting and being substituted for Jay DeMerit at half time of a 4‚Äì1 defeat to Burnley. Diagouraga made four appearances during the 2005‚Äì06 season.  2006‚Äì2008  Following Watford's promotion to the Premier League, Diagouraga failed to be called into a league squad during the 2006‚Äì07 season and instead featured in two cup ties. He spent the entire 2007‚Äì08 season away on loan and departed the Hornets at the end of the season after his contract expired. Diagouraga made only six appearances and scored no goals during his four years with the club as a professional.  Swindon Town (loan)  On 23 March 2006, Diagouraga joined League One club Swindon Town until the end of the 2005‚Äì06 season. He made his debut in a 2‚Äì0 win over Chesterfield two days later, replacing Michael Pook at half time and putting in a performance which drew comparisons to Patrick Vieira. He made eight appearances for the club and returned to Watford at the end of the season.  Rotherham United (loan)  Diagouraga joined League One club Rotherham United on loan on 12 January 2007, on a deal running until the end of the 2006‚Äì07 season. The terms of the deal saw him arrive at Millmoor as a makeweight in a ¬£1,000,000 deal that took Millers players Will Hoskins and Lee Williamson to Watford. Diagouraga made only seven appearances for the Millers.  Hereford United (loan and permanent transfer)  Diagouraga joined League Two club Hereford United on 10 August 2007, on a loan that was later extended until the end of the 2007‚Äì08 season. He scored the first senior goal of his career in a 4‚Äì2 win over Bradford City on 22 September. He made 50 appearances during the 2007‚Äì08 season, scored two goals and celebrated promotion to League One at the end of the campaign, after the Bulls secured a third-place finish in League Two. On 7 July 2008, Diagouraga transferred to Hereford United permanently and signed a three-year contract. He was a regular starter and scored his first goal of the 2008‚Äì09 season in a 2‚Äì2 draw at home to Tranmere Rovers on 26 December 2008. He was again a virtual ever-present, making 48 appearances and scoring two goals as the Bulls were relegated straight back to League Two after a bottom- place finish. He departed Edgar Street in June 2009. Across his two spells at the club, Diagouraga made 98 appearances and scored four goals.  Peterborough United  Diagouraga signed for Championship club Peterborough United on a four-year contract for an undisclosed fee (believed to be in the region of ¬£200,000) on 17 June 2009. He was an ever-present through the first half of the 2009‚Äì10 season and featured in Posh's run to the League Cup fourth round, where they were knocked out by Premier League club Blackburn Rovers. Diagouraga made what would be his last Peterborough appearance in a 0‚Äì0 draw with Ipswich Town on 8 December. Following that appearance, he fell behind new loan signings Jake Livermore and Josh Simpson in the pecking order and found himself relegated to the bench, which led to his departure on loan for the rest of the season in January 2010. He departed the club on 17 July 2010, having made 23 appearances.  Brentford (loan and permanent transfer)   2010‚Äì2012  Diagouraga joined League One club Brentford on a one-month loan on 21 January 2010 and the deal was later extended to the end of the season. He went straight into the starting lineup for Brentford's league match at Norwich City two days later and was substituted for Carl Cort after 59 minutes of the 1‚Äì0 defeat. Diagouraga quickly established himself as a regular starter and laid on goals for Charlie MacDonald and Myles Weston in a 4‚Äì0 drubbing of Gillingham on 6 February. He made 20 appearances during the second half of the 2009‚Äì10 season as Brentford consolidated their position in League One. Diagouraga signed for Brentford on a three-year contract in July 2010. He began the 2010‚Äì11 season as a starting central midfielder alongside Marcus Bean and featured in Brentford's run to the fourth round of the League Cup, in which he started in victories over Championship club Hull City and Premier League Everton in the second and third rounds respectively. Diagouraga scored his first Brentford goal in a 2‚Äì1 home win over Charlton Athletic on 2 October. Two games later, he found himself dropped to the bench and did not return to a regular starting role until teammate Nicky Forster replaced Andy Scott as manager in February 2011. With the Bees, Diagouraga reached the first cup final of his career, but ended up on the losing club and was sent off for two bookable offences in a 1‚Äì0 defeat to Carlisle United in the 2011 Football League Trophy Final at Wembley Stadium. He made 43 appearances during the 2010‚Äì11 season and scored one goal. Diagouraga suffered a knee injury in a 2011‚Äì12 pre-season friendly versus Hampton & Richmond Borough in July 2011, which ruled him out for two months. He returned to the team with a fifteen- minute cameo at the end of a 2‚Äì0 away victory over Oldham Athletic on 24 September. He made his first start of the season in a Football League Trophy second round tie away to Charlton Athletic on 5 October and scored his first goal of the season in the 3‚Äì0 victory. He twice assisted four-goal hero Mike Grella in a 6‚Äì0 win over Bournemouth in the following round. Diagouraga enjoyed a successful 2011‚Äì12 season, making 40 appearances and scoring a seasonal-best five goals.  2012‚Äì2014  Diagouraga was a virtual ever- present during the 2012‚Äì13 season, making 49 appearances and scoring one goal, which came in a 2‚Äì1 win over Notts County on 29 March 2013. He signed a new two-year contract in February 2013. Diagouraga was denied promotion to the Championship due to a missed penalty from Marcello Trotta in the final game of the season versus Doncaster Rovers and defeat to Yeovil Town in the 2013 League One Playoff Final. Now behind Adam Forshaw, George Saville and Alan McCormack in the midfield pecking order, Diagouraga featured mostly from the bench during the early stages of the 2013‚Äì14 season, before making a run of starts in late September and early October, after which he returned to the bench. He received an assurance over his future from new manager Mark Warburton in January 2014, but departed on loan the following month.  Portsmouth (loan)  Diagouraga joined League Two club Portsmouth on a one- month loan on 17 February 2014. He made his debut in a 5‚Äì1 defeat to Scunthorpe United on 22 February and played the full 90 minutes. After three appearances and receiving \\"good reports\\", Brentford manager Mark Warburton put a block on Diagouraga's loan being extended beyond 16 March. In a U-turn, it was reported on 12 March that Diagouraga's loan was expected to be extended, with a 24-hour recall clause inserted into the deal. Diagouraga was named by manager Richie Barker as captain for the final game of his initial loan, which resulted in a 3‚Äì1 defeat to Fleetwood Town on 15 March. After the match, Diagouraga reiterated his desire to stay at Fratton Park and his loan was extended until the end of the 2013‚Äì14 season on 17 March. He was recalled by Brentford on 26 March, after making eight appearances.  Return to Brentford (2014‚Äì2016)  Diagouraga made his return to the Brentford squad on 29 March 2014, as a 75th-minute substitute for Nico Yennaris in a 0‚Äì0 draw with Oldham Athletic. He made regular appearances through to the end of the season and celebrated automatic promotion to the Championship after a 1‚Äì0 victory over Preston North End on 18 April. He made 26 appearances during the 2013‚Äì14 season. Diagouraga found himself behind Marcos T√©bar and Alan McCormack in the midfield pecking order during the early months of the 2014‚Äì15 season, but he forced his way into the starting lineup in November after being challenged by Mark Warburton to earn a new contract. On 9 December, Diagouraga signed a new contract would keep him at Griffin Park until the end of the 2016‚Äì17 season. He celebrated his 200th Brentford appearance versus Leeds United at Elland Road on 7 February 2015 and assisted Alex Pritchard for the only goal of the game. On 3 May, Diagouraga was announced as the Brentford Supporters‚Äô Player of the Year. He made 43 appearances during the 2014‚Äì15 season, which ended after the Bees fell to Middlesbrough in the playoff semi- finals. Despite featuring as an ever-present in league matches during the first half of the 2015‚Äì16 season, Diagouraga handed in a transfer request on 11 January 2016 and departed Griffin Park two weeks later. He made 246 appearances and scored seven goals during six years with the club.  Leeds United  On 25 January 2016, Diagouraga joined Championship club Leeds United on a -year contract for an undisclosed fee, reported to be ¬£575,000. He made his debut versus former club Brentford on 26 January, as a substitute for Luke Murphy after an hour of the 1‚Äì1 draw. He scored his first goal for the club in the following match, with what proved to be the winner in a 2‚Äì1 FA Cup fourth round victory over Bolton Wanderers. Diagouraga scored two further goals in April and finished the 2015‚Äì16 season with 19 appearances and three goals. Diagouraga made what would prove to be his only appearance of the 2016‚Äì17 season on the opening day, with a start in a 3‚Äì0 defeat to Queens Park Rangers. He was immediately frozen out of the squad and by mid-September 2016 he was training with the club's U23 team. After failing to win a recall, he departed on loan for the remainder of the season on 23 January 2017. After surprisingly appearing as a central defender early in Leeds' 2017‚Äì18 pre- season programme, Diagouraga was left out of the squad for the club's tour of Austria and failed to win a call into a first team squad before his contract was terminated by mutual consent on 25 August 2017. Diagouraga made 20 appearances and scored three goals during just over 18 months at Elland Road.  Ipswich Town (loan)  On 23 January 2017, Diagouraga moved on loan to Championship club Ipswich Town for the remainder of the 2016‚Äì17 season. He made 12 appearances before his spell was cut short by a groin injury.  Plymouth Argyle  On 9 October 2017, Diagouraga joined League One strugglers Plymouth Argyle as a free agent and signed a contract to run until 9 January 2018. His presence in midfield brought about an upturn in the Pilgrims' form and he was offered a new 18-month contract in late December. Diagouraga rejected the contract and remained at Home Park until his deal expired. He made 17 appearances and scored three goals for Argyle.  Fleetwood Town  Diagouraga reunited with his former Brentford manager Uwe R√∂sler at League One club Fleetwood Town on 10 January 2018 and signed an 18-month contract on a free transfer. Three days later, he made his debut with a start and scored the opening goal in a 2‚Äì1 victory over Southend United. Diagouraga finished the 2017‚Äì18 season with 17 appearances and one goal and was allowed to leave on a free transfer in July 2018.  Return to Swindon Town  On 18 July 2018, Diagouraga signed a two-year contract with League Two club Swindon Town on a free transfer. In an injury-affected 2018‚Äì19 season, he made just 15 appearances. Frozen out by manager Richie Wellens during the first half of the 2019‚Äì20 season, Diagouraga made just two EFL Trophy appearances before his contract was terminated by mutual consent on 2 January 2020.

He progressed through Watford's youth academy, and started playing for the first team in the 2005‚Äì06 season. Although primarily a centre back, he spent some of his early professional career at right back due to competition for places in the middle. In his first spell at Watford, he made 247 first team appearances, including 19 in the Premier League. This included a run of 113 consecutive league appearances, the fourth longest streak in Watford's history. Mariappa captained Watford at under-18, reserve and first-team levels, and was the club's vice captain in his final few years at Vicarage Road. Mariappa accepted his first call up to Jamaica's international team in May 2012. He won his first cap against Guyana later that month, and transferred to Premier League side Reading in July 2012. He made 29 league appearances for the club before joining Premier League side Crystal Palace in September 2013, following Reading's relegation to the Championship. Returning to Watford before the 2016‚Äì17 season, Mariappa made seven league appearances that season. ==Career== Watford Mariappa with Watford in 2011 Born in nearby Harrow, Mariappa joined Watford's youth system at the age of eight. At the age of 15 he was initially told he would be released by the club. While in the Watford academy Mariappa trained with athletics and basketball clubs to improve his sprinting and jumping techniques. He captained the club's under-18 side during their FA Youth Cup quarter final against Tottenham Hotspur,\\"Watford Yth 0‚Äì2 Tottenham Yth\\". Watford F.C. 17 March 2005.

BBC Sport. 28 January 2011. Retrieved 17 April 2012. He made another cup start against Wigan Athletic in the 3rd round. During the 2005‚Äì06 season he also made three league appearances, including a clean sheet in his first league start, against Hull City on the final day of the regular season. Mariappa did not play any of Watford's play-off games, but was an unused substitute in the final, in which the team won promotion to the Premier League. Watford started their 2006‚Äì07 Premier League campaign at Everton, with Mariappa starting in central defence in place of first-team regular Jay DeMerit. He was substituted at half-time, and, aside from a League Cup appearance against Accrington Stanley, did not make another first-team appearance until December 2006, when in an away match at Newcastle United he came on for the injured James Chambers at right-back. He continued in that position, playing regularly for the rest of the season. With Watford back in the Championship for 2007‚Äì08, Mariappa found himself largely on the substitute bench, making 13 league starts and 3 in other competitions, as Watford again reached the play-offs. By contrast, he started 45 games in all competitions in the 2008‚Äì09 season, under the management of Aidy Boothroyd, Malky Mackay and latterly Brendan Rodgers, and scored his first senior goal for Watford in a 3‚Äì1 defeat at Wolves on 31 January 2009. At the end of the season he signed a two-year extension to his contract. In the absence of injured captain Jay DeMerit, Mariappa skippered Watford for the first time on 12 September 2009, in a 1‚Äì0 victory at Vicarage Road against Barnsley. He retained the captaincy during DeMerit's absence, and scored his second senior goal in October 2009, on his 100th professional appearance.Smith, Frank (30 October 2009). \\"Watford skipper backs Lloyd Doyley to lift roof off Vicarage Road\\".

He can either play as a winger, midfielder or striker. He has performed as a traditional winger for most of his career, despite the rise of inside forwards in the past decade. ==Club career== Watford Born in Acton, London, Grant started his career at Watford. He made his first team debut whilst still a member of Watford's Academy, coming on as a substitute in a League Cup match against Notts County on 23 August 2005. Whilst still an Academy scholar, he made 9 more appearances for the club, including 3 starts. Grant was rewarded with a professional contract by Watford prior to the 2006‚Äì07 season. On 31 August 2006 he joined Aldershot Town on a four-month loan, to gain experience. During his time with the Shots, he made 19 league and cup appearances, scoring 4 goals. Grant was unable to break into the Watford side during their 2006‚Äì07 Premiership campaign and he was released at the end of the season. Aldershot Town In September 2007 he rejoined Aldershot Town on non-contract terms. In December 2007 he signed a contract until the end of the season. He made 30 league appearances, scoring four times, as Aldershot Town were promoted from the Conference. Crewe Alexandra On 25 June 2008 Grant joined Crewe Alexandra for ¬£130,000, signing a three-year contract. The fee represented a club record sale for Aldershot Town. Grant scored his first goal for Crewe with a marvellous run and step over in the 2‚Äì1 win over Walsall at Gresty Road. The goal was shown as the Big Skill on Big League Weekend 2 on Sky Sports due to the step over. In 2009‚Äì10, Grant had a productive second season at Crewe, contributing nine goals and several assists marshalling the left wing. He was released from the club in May 2011, having been limited to 28 appearances in the 2010‚Äì11 campaign. Wycombe Wanderers Grant signed for Wycombe Wanderers on 27 May 2011 on a free transfer. Yeovil Town Grant signed a two-year deal with Championship side Yeovil Town on 26 June 2013. Grant made his debut for Yeovil in their Football League Cup first round victory over Southend United, on 6 August 2013. Grant was released at the end of the 2014‚Äì15 season following Yeovil's relegation to League Two. Exeter City On 21 August 2015, Grant joined Exeter City as the 1931 fan-funded player. Plymouth Argyle At the end of the 2016‚Äì17 season, Grant turned down the offer of a new contract with Exeter, to sign for their Devon rivals Plymouth Argyle. Grant operated as a traditional winger for most of his first season in the team. With manager Derek Adams opting for 4-2-3-1 and 4-3-3 formations for the first half of the 2017/18 season, Grant featured heavily but, once Adams switched to 4-3-2-1 and deployed Graham Carey and Ruben Lameiras as inside forwards, Grant lost favour and was only involved as a defensive substitute or a backup striker. To counteract this, he evolved tactically in the following 2018/19 season and began to exhibit traits more associated with inside forwards than traditional wingers. Consequently, the rates at which he completed dribbles, created chances and scored goals increased. He was offered a new contract by Plymouth Argyle at the end of the 2018‚Äì19 season. He signed a new contract in June 2019. In October 2019 he scored in his third game in a row, and was praised by manager Ryan Lowe. Swindon Town On 19 September 2020, Grant joined Swindon Town on a one year deal following a successful trial ==International career== In June 2006 Grant earned a call-up to the Jamaica under-23 squad to play in the Central American and Caribbean Games taking place in Colombia between 15 and 29 July. He spent much of February 2007 with the squad for the CONCACAF under-20 World Cup qualifiers. In May 2014 Grant was called up to the Jamaica senior squad, and made his full international d√©but playing for 78 minutes against Serbia on 26 May.

He won seven caps for Jamaica in 2013. He began his career at Watford, making his debut in the English Football League in April 2006 and his debut in the Premier League in May 2007. He was loaned out to Southern League side Wealdstone in 2007, and then League Two side Hereford United, and scored 16 goals in 52 appearances to help Hereford win promotion in the 2007‚Äì08 season. He spent the 2008‚Äì09 season on loan at Southend United, and was sold on to Huddersfield Town in July 2009. He was loaned out to Millwall in September 2010, and joined the club on a permanent basis in January 2011. The following month he was loaned out to Derby County, and joined the club on a permanent basis in the summer. He rejoined Huddersfield Town on loan in February 2013, and was sold to Doncaster Rovers in August 2013. He joined Scunthorpe United on loan in March 2015. He signed with Scottish Premiership side Motherwell in August 2015, and moved on to Port Vale in January 2016, and then Lincoln City in October 2016. He was sold on to Southend United in January 2017, and then loaned out to Swindon Town 12 months later. He was loaned out to Colchester United in August 2019. He rejoined Port Vale in August 2020. ==Club career== Watford Robinson was born in Birmingham, West Midlands. He spent one season as a schoolboy at the Stoke City Academy, before being released at the age of 16. He took part at an exit trial held by the English Football League at Derby County's Moor Farm training ground in 2005, where he was spotted by Watford, and signed on a two-year apprenticeship having impressed during a subsequent week's training at the club. He made his first team debut against Queens Park Rangers on 22 April 2006, coming on as a half-time substitute for Darius Henderson in a 2‚Äì1 victory at Loftus Road. In February 2007 he went on a one-month loan to Southern Football League Premier Division club Wealdstone. Robinson made his Premier League debut as a late substitute in Watford's final game of the 2006‚Äì07 season, a 1‚Äì1 draw with Newcastle United at Vicarage Road on 13 May. In August 2007, Robinson joined League Two side Hereford United on a four- month loan, alongside teammate Toumani Diagouraga. He scored his first goal in the Football League on 18 August, in a 2‚Äì1 win at Barnet. Manager Graham Turner compared him to a young Steve Bull, saying that \\"he's very lively, he's got pace, and gets himself into good positions.\\" Robinson finished the season as top goalscorer for Hereford with 16 goals in all competitions as they achieved promotion in third-place. With Darius Henderson suspended, Watford manager Aidy Boothroyd was hoping to use Robinson in the Championship play- offs, but confirmed that he was unable to do so due to the terms of Robinson's loan deal at Hereford. Robinson playing for Southend United Robinson made four appearances for Watford in the 2008‚Äì09 season, but was not in new manager Brendan Rodgers's first team plan's, who replaced Boothroyd as manager in November. On 24 January 2009, Robinson joined League One side Southend United on loan until the end of the 2008‚Äì09 season. He formed an effective strike partnership with Lee Barnard and impressed manager Steve Tilson with his performances. Tilson made a bid for Robinson at the end of the season. Though Rodgers left Watford and was succeeded by Malky Mackay, Robinson had already decide to leave the club. Huddersfield Town In July 2009, Robinson signed for League One club Huddersfield Town on a three-year deal for an undisclosed fee. He chose Huddersfield ahead of a number of other clubs, including Swindon Town, who had a \\"verbal agreement\\" to sign Robinson from Watford for ¬£275,000 according to manager Danny Wilson. Swindon manager Andrew Fitton stated that \\"We agreed a deal with the club and player but there are shenanigans going on that we have warned certain people about. This is a classic example of agents and greed.\\" On 26 August, he scored two goals in a 4‚Äì3 League Cup defeat to Newcastle United at St James' Park. He began the season in a strike partnership with Jordan Rhodes before being dropped fin favour of Lee Novak. He ended the 2009‚Äì10 season with 16 goals in 43 appearances. He was linked with a move away from Huddersfield in June 2010, but manager Lee Clark said that the rumours did not come from the Galpharm Stadium and that \\"it seems as though someone is trying to orchestrate a move.\\" Millwall On 8 September 2010, after falling down the pecking order at Huddersfield, Robinson moved to Millwall on a 93-day emergency loan. He returned to Huddersfield in early November through injury, with the need for an operation on his knee, cutting his loan spell short. He joined Millwall on a two-and-a-half-year deal for an undisclosed fee in January 2011. Manager Kenny Jackett said that Robinson would want to prove Huddersfield wrong, and therefore have a hunger to perform at The Den. Derby County In February 2011, Robinson signed a three-month loan deal at Championship club Derby County, with a view to a permanent move. Robinson scored twice in 13 games during this loan spell. He impressed manager Nigel Clough, who told BBC Radio Derby that \\"hopefully Theo will be here next season as well, as one of five or six strikers.\\" He joined Derby on a two-year contract after his contract with Millwall ended in the summer. Despite being Derby's second top-scorer with three goals in six league starts, Robinson was sometimes criticised by supporters on Twitter for not scoring enough goals and being \\"rubbish\\". He answered his critics by scoring a brace in Derby's 3‚Äì2 defeat at Peterborough United, taking his tally for the season up to six, making him the club's top- scorer. Robinson finished the 2011‚Äì12 season with 12 goals in all competitions and joint top-scorer with Steve Davies. Robinson was reprimanded by the club after he broke club rules by posting on Twitter that he was dropped from the matchday squad before the team was announced for the game at Bolton Wanderers on 21 August 2012. Four days later Robinson came off the bench to score a last minute equaliser against Wolverhampton Wanderers. He struggled to get into the starting line-up as Conor Sammon and Jamie Ward were Clough's preferred attackers, but Robinson regained his place in the starting line-up after an injury to Ward and Clough praised Robinson for his improved work ethic, saying \\"... he's doing his job now... he now has seven goals for the season and he is liable to get goals.\\" On 22 February 2013, after asking to leave on loan to get regular first team football, Robinson rejoined his former club Huddersfield Town on an emergency loan to the end of the 2012‚Äì13 season. Upon his return to Pride Park in May, Robinson was made available for transfer with one year left on his contract. Doncaster Rovers In August 2013, Robinson signed with Doncaster Rovers on a two-year contract for an undisclosed fee. The fee was undisclosed but was reported to be in the region of ¬£150,000. He scored his first goal for the club on his debut the following day, in a 2‚Äì0 win over Blackburn Rovers. He ended the 2013‚Äì14 campaign with five goals in 31 Championship games as \\"Donny\\" were relegated into League One. On 26 March 2015, he joined divisional rivals Scunthorpe United on loan until the end of the 2014‚Äì15 season. The move to Glanford Park reunited him with his former Huddersfield manager Mark Robins. He was released by Rovers manager Paul Dickov in May 2015. Motherwell Robinson signed for Scottish Premiership side Motherwell in August 2015 on a contract running until the end of the 2015‚Äì16 season. He said that he was attracted to the club as he was already friends with teammates Lionel Ainsworth and Stephen Pearson. He was initially used as a substitute by manager Ian Baraclough. He fell out of the first team picture under new manager Mark McGhee, who later said that \\"It's not quite worked out for Theo here at Fir Park, but that can happen, particularly if the manager who signs you leaves so soon after you arrive.\\" Port Vale In January 2016, Robinson signed for League One side Port Vale on a contract running until the end of the 2015‚Äì16 season. He was initially used as a substitute at Vale Park, but began starting games as he claimed to be \\"getting fitter, stronger and sharper with each game\\". He scored his first goal for the club on his eighth appearance, the opening goal of a 2‚Äì0 home win over Colchester United on 5 March. He was released upon the expiry of his contract at the end of the season. Lincoln City Robinson signed a short-term contract with National League club Lincoln City in October 2016. On 7 January, he scored both of the \\"Imps\\" goals in a 2‚Äì2 draw with Championship side Ipswich Town in an FA Cup third round tie at Portman Road. He also scored against Brighton & Hove Albion in the following round, and left Lincoln with the club in the fifth round of the FA Cup and top of the National League. Southend United Robinson returned to EFL League One when he joined Southend United for an undisclosed fee on a two-and-a-half-year contract on 31 January 2017. Manager Phil Brown had rejected the chance to sign Robinson the previous summer after the player had a trial at the club, and admitted he had made a mistake in doing so. He made 18 appearances in the second half of the 2016‚Äì17 season and signed a one-year contract extension in August 2017. However he made just two league starts in the first half of the 2017‚Äì18 season and rejected the chance to join Colchester United on loan in January after his preferred option of Lincoln City were rebuffed by chairman Ron Martin. He was instead restored to the first-team at Roots Hall by new manager Chris Powell, and scored a hat-trick in a 4‚Äì0 win over Milton Keynes Dons on 21 April to earn himself a place on the EFL team of the week. He was nominated for that month's PFA Fan's Player Of The Month award. Robinson began the 2018‚Äì19 season on the bench, though did score three goals in his five starts by the start of October. He went on to make 13 league starts and 11 substitute appearances in the first half of the campaign, scoring four goals. On 31 January, he joined EFL League Two side Swindon Town on loan until the end of the 2018‚Äì19 season. He went on to score seven goals in 16 games for the \\"Robins\\", helping to relegate Notts County with a brace at the County Ground on the final day of the season. Swindon manager Richie Wellens was reportedly keen to sign him on a permanent basis once the loan spell came to an end. On 29 August 2019, Robinson joined League Two side Colchester United on loan until January 2020. He scored his first goal for \\"U's\\" in their 3‚Äì2 EFL Trophy win against Gillingham on 3 September. After a relatively successful start to the campaign for Robinson, the loan deal was extended until the end of the 2019‚Äì20 season on 14 January. On 11 February, he scored his 100th Football League goal in a 3‚Äì2 defeat at Grimsby Town. He had scored 12 goals in 36 games by the time the 2019‚Äì20 season was ended early in March due to the COVID-19 pandemic in England; Southend would be relegated after the table was concluded on a points per game basis. He returned to Colchester to play in the play-off semi-finals, which ended in a 3‚Äì2 aggregate defeat to Exeter City. He scored at a rate of one every 157 minutes during his loan spell, a statistic bettered only by Eoin Doyle in League Two. He confirmed his departure from Southend in June 2020. Return to Port Vale On 24 August 2020, Robinson rejoined Port Vale on a two-year deal, where he faced competition from Tom Pope, Mark Cullen and Devante Rodney for a place in the starting eleven. He stated that \\"when I was here before it wasn‚Äôt really a good time personally but now I am here to put things right\\". It was reported that Grimsby manager Ian Holloway had tried to sign him but lost out due to his club insisting on a clause to reduce pay if the league was postponed or cancelled again due to a second wave of Coronavirus disease 2019 cases; Vale reportedly had no such clause in their contract offer. On 5 September, he scored on his second debut for the Vale, coming on as a substitute to score a late winner in a 2‚Äì1 victory over Scunthorpe United in the first round of the EFL Cup, manager John Askey said that \\"It's nice when you have someone like Theo who can come on and has goals in him\\". Robinson set a personal target of 10 goals for the campaign but said the main aim was promotion. ==International career== In November 2012, the Jamaica Football Federation reported that Robinson had shown interest playing for the Reggae Boyz and that he was in the pool of players eligible to be called up for the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifiers. He won his first cap in a 0‚Äì0 draw with Mexico on 6 February 2013. ==Style of play== Robinson is a pacey striker. ==Personal life== In April 2020, Robinson launched a YouTube channel called The Ball Don‚Äôt Lie, along with Colchester teammate Frank Nouble. ==Statistics== {  +Appearances and goals by club, season and competition - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Club !rowspan=\\"2\\"Season !rowspan=\\"2\\"Division !colspan=\\"2\\"League !colspan=\\"2\\"National Cup !colspan=\\"2\\"League Cup !colspan=\\"2\\"Other !colspan=\\"2\\"Total - !Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals - rowspan=\\"5\\"Watford 2005‚Äì06 Championship 1000000010 - 2006‚Äì07 Premier League 1000000010 - 2007‚Äì08 Championship 0000000000 - 2008‚Äì09 Championship 3000100040 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !5!!0!!0!!0!!1!!0!!0!!0!!6!!0 - Hereford United (loan) 2007‚Äì08 League Two 43136221105216 - Southend United (loan) 2008‚Äì09 League One 217000000217 - rowspan=\\"3\\"Huddersfield Town 2009‚Äì10 League One 37133023104316 - 2010‚Äì11 League One1000100020 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !38!!13!!3!!0!!3!!3!!1!!0!!45!!16 - Millwall 2010‚Äì11 Championship 113000000113 - rowspan=\\"4\\"Derby County 2010‚Äì11 Championship 132000000132 - 2011‚Äì12 Championship 39101111004112 - 2012‚Äì13 Championship 288001100299 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !80!!20!!1!!1!!2!!2!!0!!0!!83!!23 - Huddersfield Town (loan) 2012‚Äì13 Championship 6000000060 - rowspan=\\"3\\"Doncaster Rovers 2013‚Äì14 Championship 315001000325 - 2014‚Äì15 League One 327402020407 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !63!!12!!4!!0!!3!!0!!2!!0!!72!!12 - Scunthorpe United (loan) 2014‚Äì15 League One 8300000083 - Motherwell 2015‚Äì16 Scottish Premiership 100001000110 - Port Vale 2015‚Äì16 League One 142000000142 - Lincoln City 2016‚Äì17 National League 141770010228 - rowspan=\\"5\\"Southend United 2016‚Äì17 League One 182000000182 - 2017‚Äì18 League One 255001042307 - 2018‚Äì19 League One 244301030314 - 2019‚Äì20 League One 3000100040 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !70!!11!!3!!0!!3!!0!!7!!2!!83!!13 - Swindon Town (loan) 2018‚Äì19 League Two 167000000167 - Colchester United (loan) 2019‚Äì20 League Two 28110000613412 - Port Vale 2020‚Äì21 League Two 71002122114 - !colspan=\\"3\\"Career total !434!!104!!24!!9!!17!!7!!20!!5!!493!!126 } ==Honours== Hereford United *Football League Two third-place promotion: 2007‚Äì08 ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:1989 births Category:Living people Category:Footballers from Birmingham, West Midlands Category:English people of Jamaican descent Category:English footballers Category:Black English sportspeople Category:Jamaican footballers Category:Jamaica international footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:Watford F.C. players Category:Wealdstone F.C. players Category:Hereford United F.C. players Category:Southend United F.C. players Category:Huddersfield Town A.F.C. players Category:Millwall F.C. players Category:Derby County F.C. players Category:Doncaster Rovers F.C. players Category:Scunthorpe United F.C. players Category:Motherwell F.C. players Category:Port Vale F.C. players Category:Lincoln City F.C. players Category:Swindon Town F.C. players Category:Colchester United F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:Premier League players Category:Southern Football League players Category:Scottish Professional Football League players Category:National League (English football) players ","title":"Theo Robinson"},{"id":"5598984","text":"B√§umler or Baeumler (Americanized as Baumler) is a German surname.

The term arose in historical linguistics, referring to the convergence of morphological forms within inflectional paradigms. In such cases, a former distinction has been 'syncretized'.Crystal, David. A Dictionary of Linguistics and Phonetics. Blackwell Publishing, 2008, pp. 469-70. The term syncretism is often used when a fairly regular pattern can be observed across a paradigm. Syncretism is a specific form of linguistic homophony. Homophony refers to any instance of two words or morphemes with the same pronunciation (form) but different meaning. Syncretism is a type of homophony that occurs within a specific paradigm in which the syntax would require separate forms. Accidental homophony does occur in paradigms, however, and Linguist Sebastian Bank of the University of Leipzig makes the distinction between accidental homophony and syncretism in paradigms through natural classes. When a set of identical paradigmatic forms are connected by a feature in common, and a native speaker cannot tell the difference between the forms, this is said to be syncretism. Syncretism can arise through either phonological or morphological change. Baerman et al. call these two sources of syncretism \\"blind phonological change\\" and \\"morphosyntactic readjustment\\". In the case of phonological change, originally distinct forms change to be pronounced identically, so that their distinctness is lost. Such change can often be observed in the modern German verb paradigm: the infinitive nehmen 'to take' comes from Old High German neman, the first person plural declension nehmen comes from nemƒìm, and the third person plural nehmen comes from nemant. This is also an example of syncretism manifested in lexemes. {  +Phonological change in the German verb paradigm ! !Old High German ! --> !Modern German ---> infinitive neman  nehmen - 1.PL nemƒìm  nehmen - 3.PL. nemant  nehmen } Some scholars, according to Baerman et al., purport that blind phonological change should only be considered to yield homophony, not syncretism. This distinction between the two sources of syncretism is important in theory, but is harder to maintain de facto. In the case of morphological change, one form stops being used and is replaced by the other. This change can be exemplified by the syncretism in Latin's third-declension nouns, whose nouns take the same form in nominative and vocative cases. == Forms of syncretism == Baerman et al. identify three forms of syncretism. These are simple syncretism, nested syncretism, and contrary syncretism. Simple syncretism occurs when a minimum of two cells in a paradigm are syncretic. Nested syncretism occurs when more than two cells in a paradigm are syncretic to the same form. Contrary syncretism occurs when there are multiple cases of simple syncretism, in which each case in the paradigm of the simple syncretism is separate from the others. {  +Simple Syncretism In English Plural and Singular YOU !Person !Singular !Plural - 1st I We - 2nd You You - 3rd He/She They } In the chart above a model of simple syncretism is shown in the singular and plural forms of the second person subject pronoun in English. There is another example in the chart of simple syncretism in the masculine and feminine third person plural subject pronouns, both realized as they. Together these two cases of syncretism are an example of contrary syncretism. The chart below shows a model of nested syncretism, in which more than one cell in the paradigm of subjunctive verb conjugation in Brazilian Portuguese is realized as the same form, \\"seja.\\" {  +Nested Syncretism in Brazilian Portuguese Subjunctive Ser/To Be !Person !Singular !Plural - 1st Eu seja N√≥s sejamos - 2nd Voc√™ seja Voc√™s sejam - 3rd Ele/Ela seja Eles/Elas sejam } Stump, in his 2001 book Inflectional Morphology: A Theory of Paradigm Structure, identifies four distinct types of syncretism. This model is called directional syncretism, as it refers to the direction in which the syncretism occurs and progresses. The four directions of syncretism are unidirectional, bidirectional, unstipulated, and symmetrical. Unidirectional syncretism is the concept that the form of one cell in the paradigm is mapped onto another cell. This is exemplified through the exploration of accusative forms of neutral words in Indo-European languages. In Indo-European languages that have the neutral gender, the nominative and accusative forms of neuter words tend to be the same. The accusative case is the marked case (meaning the presence of accusative implies the presence of nominative, while the nominative case can exist in a language without the accusative), and so it can be assumed that the form of the nominative neuter word was mapped onto the accusative form. As in the Slovak word for \\"word\\", slovo, which is the same in both nominative and accusative, while masculine animate and feminine words change from case to case, as shown in the chart below. {  +Slovak Grammatical Gender and Case !Gender !Nominative Form !Accusative Form !English - Masc Animate pes psa 'dog' - Fem ≈æena ≈æenu 'woman' - Neutr slovo slovo 'word' } Stump's next form of syncretism is bidirectional. This is similar to unidirectional, but differs in that in some cases the mapping is from one direction, and in other cases the mapping is from the other direction. This is exemplified in Russian in Genitive Singular and Nominative Plural forms. In some cases it is realized as G.Sg -> N.Pland in other cases it is realized as N.Pl -> G.Sg. Unstipulated syncretism occurs when syncretism occurs in a direction that is not quite so obvious, but the syncretized forms are connected by a natural class of feature. An example of this is the syncretism among German genitive and dative, masculine and neutral, nominal elements, where the only forms not syncretized in this paradigm are feminine, so the natural class is [-fem]. This is shown in the chart below. {  +Nominal Elements in German Genitive and Dative Cases !Grammatical Gender !Genitive !Dative - Masc Des Dem - Fem Der Der - Neutr Des Dem } The final category in Stump's four type syncretism model is that of symmetrical syncretism. This category has the least defined boundaries, and is defined more as the syncretism that occurs when there is no directional syncretism and no evident natural class. Dieter Wunderlich, in Explorations in Nominal Inflection argues against Stump's four-type syncretism model, asking \\"Is There Any Need for the Concept of Directional Syncretism?\\" Wunderlich proposes that all instances of supposed directional syncretism, be it uni-or bi-directional, are in actuality cases of unstipulated or symmetrical syncretism. == English == In English, syncretism led to the loss of case marking and the stabilization of word order. For example, the nominative and accusative forms of you are the same, whereas he/him, she/her, etc., have different forms depending on grammatical case. Another English example for syncretism can be observed in most English verb paradigms: there is no morphological distinction between the past participle and the passive participle, and, often, the past tense. {  href=\\"Vocative case\\" + href=\\"Latin declension#Third declension .28i.29\\" Syncretism in English verb paradigms ! ! href=\\"German language\\" past tense ! href=\\"infinitive\\" past participle ! href=\\"Grammatical person\\" passive participle - href=\\"Grammatical person\\" to walk walked walked  href=\\"Finnic languages\\" walked - href=\\"Estonian language\\"  href=\\"Genitive case\\" to win won won won }The syncretism observed here differs from the lexical syncretism observed in English personal pronouns inasmuch that the syncretism manifests itself in the suffix or stem change in the case of walked and won, respectively. == Ingvaeonic languages == Dialects to the north of the line have one plural form, dialects to the south have two. In the Ingvaeonic languages, a subgroup of the West Germanic languages, an important case of syncretism developed in the inflection of verbs, where the forms for the three plural persons became identical. Old English has wƒì habba√æ, ƒ°ƒì habba√æ and hƒ´e habba√æ (we, you, they have) and Old Saxon has wƒ´ hebbiad, gƒ´ hebbiad and sia hebbiad, all with the same verb form. Such \\"unified plural\\" languages contrasted with the more southern Old Dutch and Old High German, which still had three distinct forms for each, e.g. OHG wƒ´r habem, ƒ´r habet, siu habent. In the modern languages, this distinction remains an important isogloss separating Low German from Dutch and the High German languages. == Latin == In Latin, the nominative and vocative of third- declension nouns have the same form (e.g. rƒìx 'king' is both nominative and vocative singular), distributing syncretism in case marking. Another observation is the distinction between dative and ablative, which is present in singular (e.g., puellae 'girl-DAT.SG' and puella 'girl-ABL.SG'), but not anymore in plural (e.g., puellis 'girl-DAT.PL/girl-ABL.PL'. == Other languages == In the Finnic languages, such as Finnish and Estonian, there is syncretism between the accusative and genitive singular case forms, and the nominative and accusative plural case forms. == Accounts for syncretism == There exists a cross-linguistic typological investigation of syncretism (\\"The Syntax- Morphology Interface: A Study of Syncretism\\" by Baermann, Brown and Corbett, 2005). This study explores the logical space of syncretism, i.e., what features may be involved, and what sort of patterns do these describe. It also provided a diverse sampling of the world's languages. Other studies on syncretism include \\"A Distributed Morphology Approach to Syncretism in Russian Noun inflection\\" (M√ºller 2004) in which M√ºller provides a systematic account for Russian noun inflection. ==ReferencesBibliography== * * * Category:Linguistic morphology Category:Syncretism ","title":"Syncretism (linguistics)"},{"id":"5599015","text":"Broad-based Black Economic Empowerment (BBBEE) is an intergration programme launched by the South African government to reconcile South Africans and redress the inequalities of Apartheid by attempting to compensate for land that was disposed from Africans (African, It encourages businesses to integrate black people in the workspace, upskill and mentor, support black businesses, give back to mainly poor communities across the country which remain poor due to the land dispossession and a majority of this communities are black South Africans. Land still rests with white minority capitalist For this exercise businesses are awarded points which they can claim on their BBBEE certificate. This certificate is used in compliance with government spend regulations. Businesses with a good level in BBBEE stand a good chance on government contracts. ==The act== The Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment Act (Act 53 of 2003) essentially works on the understanding that years of systemic racism contribute to contemporary economic woes, and that government intervention can stem the results of past racist regimes. Black people of South Africa were disposed of their land by the apartheid regime as a result black people have been systematically excluded from the economy. The apartheid regime excluded black people from fair trades, professional employment and general freedom of movement. B-BBEE seeks to compensate for some of the previous injustices A set of Codes of Good Practice was gazetted on 9 February 2007 in the government gazette 29617. An Interpretive Guide was added in June 2007. The Codes of Good Practice contains sections about measuring ownership, management control, employment, skills development, preferential procurement, enterprise development, socio-economic development, and qualifying small enterprises. == Measurement == Broad-based black economic empowerment is, as from 2015 measured under the amended Code of Good Practice which consists of the following 5 elements: \\\\- Ownership - 25 points \\\\- Management control - 19 points \\\\- Skills Development - 25 points \\\\- Enterprise and Supplier Development - 40 points \\\\- Socio-economic development - 5 points Prior to 2015, the Generic Code of Good Practice consisted of the following breakdown: * Direct empowerment: ** Equity ownership ‚Äì 20% ** Management ‚Äì 10% * Indirect empowerment: ** Employment equity ‚Äì 15% ** Skills development ‚Äì 15% ** Preferential procurement ‚Äì 20% ** Enterprise development ‚Äì 15% ** Socio- economic development ‚Äì 5% == Verification and BBBEE certificates == It is not mandatory to get a verification agency to audit a BEE Scorecard. It is however a requirement to have suitable documentation/evidence to score any points. SANAS (South African National Accreditation System) and IRBA (Independent Regulatory Body for Auditor) has been mandated with accrediting verification agencies. This accreditation has been put in place to ensure the consistency of the independent verification of BBBEE contributions. BEE certificates can be issued by any verification agency so long as they are approved to do so by SANAS or IRBA. Accounting officers registered in term of the Close corporation Act of 1984 can also issue the BBBEE certificates for EMEs The certificate can only be issued once a full verification has been performed. == Industry specific measurement == Companies may choose to be measured using the Generic Scorecard (as described above and created by the government) or their individual sector scorecards. Various sector scorecards have already been finalised, including construction, tourism, forestry, transport, finance, information technology, mining, petroleum and others. Industry scorecards are created to address industry specific issues and complications with regard to implementing BBBEE. All industry specific scorecards must align themselves to the generic scorecard. Companies may not measure their suppliers according to their own sector scorecards. For example, a large banking institution may not measure their ICT service providers according to the financial sector scorecard. The ICT company will present a verification certificate to the financial institution based on the generic scorecard or the ICT sector scorecard. BBEEE is not only a compliance issue anymore but also a competitive issue == Development of legislation == The Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment Bill along with the BEE strategy document of South Africa serves as guideline and driver for developing Codes of Good Practice that describe measurement criteria, targets, audit requirements and definitions for each of the 7 pillars in detail. Additional codes of good practice have also been released with regards to complex structures, broad-based ownership schemes, fronting practices and verification agencies. The Codes are developed by the BEE task team set up by the South African Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) and comprises individuals representing various areas: private and public sectors, various industries, research and BEE measurement etc. They are Cyril Ramaphosa, Saki Macozoma, Derek Cooper, Patrice Motsepe, Gloria Serobe, Danisa Baloyi, Buhle Mthethwa, Vuyo Jack, Ronnie Ntuli, Loyiso Mbabane, Imogen Mkhize, Alan Hirsch, Philisiwe Buthelezi and Lionel October. Companies in South Africa that deal with the government or parastatals must be empowered as required by the Preferential Procurement Act. In return, these companies require their suppliers to be empowered to improve their rating at government. Thus broad-based empowerment is driven down the supply chain. Various other legislation supports the BEE effort, including the Skills Development Act and Employment Equity Act. == Enterprise size's effect on BBBEE == In terms of Act 53 (2003) Codes of Good Practice for Black Economic Empowerment all enterprises in South Africa are divided into one of three categories: *Generic enterprises (turnover greater than R50 million) *Qualifying small enterprises (turnover between R10 million and R50 million) *Exempted micro enterprises (turnover less than R10 million) In terms of Act 53 (2003) each of these categories have differing sets of measurement criteria.  Generic Enterprises  Generic enterprises are those enterprises that have a turnover of greater than R50 million. It is estimated that only 4% of South African enterprises fall into this category. Generic enterprises must apply all seven pillars of BBBEE to calculate their score as per the Generic Scorecard. Generic Enterprises must apply Code 000-700 of the Act and apply stringent reporting techniques.  Qualifying Small Enterprises (QSE)  Qualifying small enterprises (QSEs) are enterprises that have a turnover between R10 million and R50 million, they apply Code 800 to calculate their scorecards. Code 800 is a simplified version of Code 000-700 which includes less stringent scorecards for each element. QSEs can choose the best four of their seven elements, with each element accounting for 25% of their scorecard out of 100. While Code 800 is a simplified version of the other 7 pillars it has been ruled by the DTI that any issues not specifically discussed in Code 800 should instead have Code 100‚Äì700 applied.  Exempted Micro Enterprises (EME)  Exempted micro enterprises (EMEs) are enterprises with a turnover of less than R10 million. That will be in the new codes. EMEs do not need to be rated, but they do need to be able to provide reasonable evidence that they are EMEs. EMEs automatically qualify as 100% contributors towards Preferential Procurement. If they are greater than 50% black owned they qualify as 110% contributors towards Preferential Procurement. == Impact of the BEE on employers and employees == The impact of BBBEE is difficult to measure as the Codes of Good Practice were only promulgated in February 2007. According to the Institute for Justice and Reconciliation's Economic Transformation Audit, the number of Black Management and Professionals has increased from 216,772 in 1995 to 359,438 in 2005. A general criticism can be made that wealthy and politically connected black individuals have been the real beneficiaries of BEE and not those still living in poverty. In fact, unemployment and inequality have both increased since the introduction of BBBEE policies. In 2018 a surfacing argument is that BBBEE should be changed from a race-based policy to a policy that favours poverty regardless of skin colour. Apartheid was criticised exactly because of race-based legislation that favoured a minority based on skin colour and BBBEE once again has introduced race-based policies diverting South Africa's problems from endemic poverty to race. To date, there is no pronounced sunset date for BBBEE and it has become a political tool for parties that believe the black majority of South Africa favours discrimination based on race. In addition some sector's of the South African economy BBBEE laws impose an annual fine of 10% of a companies revenue or 5 million rand, which ever is the highest, if they do not comply and give black majority 30% equity. ==References External links == * Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment Act 53 of 2003 Category:Black economic empowerment Category:South African society Category:Ethnic empowerment ","title":"Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment"},{"id":"5599026","text":"Dimitar Talev (1930s) Monument to Talev in Borisova gradina park, Sofia, Bulgaria.

Talev studied medicine and philosophy in Zagreb and Vienna, and Slavic philology in Sofia University (1925). He was the managing editor of the Macedonia newspaper, and a contributor and editor in the Zora newspaper. In 1944 he was arrested by the communist authorities for his patriotic and anti-macedonistic position and sent to the Sofia Central Prison and later to the labor camps Bobov Dol and . He was expelled from the Bulgarian Writers' Union and from 1948 to 1952 he was exiled in Lukovit. After Valko Chervenkov was replaced by Todor Zhivkov, Talev was declared by the new government as unlawfully repressed and was subsequently pardoned and rehabilitated. His membership in the author's union was restored and he would be elected to its governing board. Zhivkov's government awarded Talev with three awards in the field of literation - in 1959, 1963 and 1966, respectively. In 1966 Talev was elected as MP in the 31st Narodno Sabranie (Bulgarian Parliament).

Generally, spelling reforms have been more widely accepted in the United States and less so in other English-speaking areas. One problem is that a pronunciation with the velar fricative is still found locally in parts of North-East Scotland, where, for example, trough is pronounced . In April 1984, at its yearly meeting, the Simplified Spelling Society adopted the following reform as its house style:\\"The Society's 1984 Proposals\\".

It was first published in the UK by William Heinemann Ltd in 1956. ==Plot summary== The story concerns a young American geologist, Stanton Laird, working in the Australian outback in the field of oil exploration. Although he is in a very remote location - beyond the black stump - in a region called \\"the Lunatic\\" in Western Australia, he is part of a crew that has a well-appointed mobile facility. He is befriended by a local farming family, the Regans, and develops a relationship with their daughter Mollie. The Regans run an enormously profitable station, but their domestic lifestyle is, to say the least, unconventional, with the two Regan brothers at one time having Mollie's mother move from one to the other without bothering to get a divorce. The family is large, and even larger when counting the half-caste children produced by both fathers, and the children are taught by the Judge, an English exile and alcoholic, who gives the children an excellent education and keeps the finances of the station properly accounted for. Over the course of the explorations (which prove unsuccessful), he notes the unique lifestyle on what amounts to the Australian frontier, and falls in love with Mollie. The two wish to wed, but Mollie's mother insists that Mollie first see how the Lairds live in their Oregon town, Hazel, which was once on the frontier, but is no longer, though its citizens take pride in feeling that it still is. The two travel to Hazel. At first, Mollie gets along well in the Laird family home. But then Stanton's one-time love, Ruth, the widow of Stanton's best friend, returns to Hazel with her son. The son bears a tremendous resemblance to Stanton, and Stanton is moved to confess to Mollie both that the son may be his, and that he killed a girl in a drunken accident as a teenager. Mollie is unconcerned about the boy‚Äîsuch things are common where she comes from‚Äîbut is concerned and judgmental about the accident, and about Stanton's lack of concern for the dead girl. As Stanton expected Mollie to care very much about the boy, and did not expect her to be so concerned about the girl, the two begin to realize they have a very different outlook on life. Eventually, Mollie comes to realize that she will never fit in while in Hazel, and does not particularly want to. Her place is on the true frontier, in the Lunatic, not in Hazel. She returns to Australia, where she will likely marry a young neighbor, an emigrant from England, who has long loved her. Stanton is likely to marry Ruth, as Mollie suggests he should. Stanton has a wedding present for Mollie, though‚Äîhis final report reveals that the neighbor's impoverished lands lie over great quantities of artesian water, which will allow the neighbor‚Äîand Mollie‚Äîto flourish. ==Location== According to the co-ordinates for the oil exploration given in the final pages of the novel‚Äî23 degrees 5 minutes South, 118 degrees 51 minutes EastNevil Shute, Beyond the Black Stump, Vintage, London, p. 237.‚Äîmost of the story is set in the Ophthalmia Range in the Pilbara region of Western Australia, roughly halfway between where the towns of Paraburdoo and Newman are today.

The 62 km long left tributary to the Golijska Moravica river, it originates from two headstreams, the Veliki Rzav and the Mali Rzav. The river is sometimes referred to as the Golijski Rzav (Serbian Cyrillic: –ì–æ–ª–∏—ò—Å–∫–∏ –†–∑–∞–≤, \\"Rzav of Golija\\") to distinguish it from another Rzav river in Serbia, the Rzav of Zlatibor. == Mali Rzav == The Mali Rzav (, \\"Little Rzav\\") is the Rzav's shorter headstream. It originates from the northern slopes of the Muƒçanj mountain, near the village of Katiƒái. Originally the river flows to the west, but at the village of Bjelu≈°a it makes a large elbow turn, parallel to the even larger elbow turn of the Veliki Rzav. At the villages of Gornja Kru≈°ƒáica and Vranovina, the Mali Rzav straightens its course to the north and on the southern slopes of the Blagaja mountain meets the Veliki Rzav. == Veliki Rzav == The Veliki Rzav (, \\"Great Rzav\\") is the Rzav's longer headstream and sometimes it is referred to as just Rzav alongside its whole course. It originates from the southern slopes of the Murtenica mountain, southern extension of the Zlatibor mountain, in the northern part of the Stari Vlah region. The Veliki Rzav originally flows eastward, next to the villages of Gornja Bela Reka and Donja Bela Reka (Serbian for upper white river and lower white river, referring to the river's clear water). At the village of Klekova the river sharply turns to the north, making a large elbow turn, beginning at the village of Velika, on the western slope of the ƒåigota mountain. Inside this elbow turn is the smaller curve of the Mali Rzav, and the two rivers get at one point less than 2 km apart. The Veliki Rzav receives from the left the Katu≈°nica river and continues to curve to the north in the mountain region, between the villages of Razlo≈æina and ƒåiƒçkovo, making another sharp elbow turn to the east, between the Lipovac and Gradina peaks, southeast of the town of U≈æice. After the village of Roge, the river continues on the southern slope of the Blagaja mountain, receiving the Mali Rzav from the right. For the most part, the road follows the curvy river. There are 8 beaches along the river (Bosa Noga (Bare foot), Sonjine Oƒçi (Sonja's eyes), Pogledi (Gazes)), but the river is known for its cold water. At the locality of Bojoviƒáa Kuk, the river carved a canyon. The fishing in the river is forbidden. There are several fishponds along the route, mostly for breeding trout. The spa of Visoƒçka Banja is located on the river. The thermal water has . Formerly, the spa water was forming a pond of lukewarm water. The spa was recorded as health beneficial in 1936. In 1952, one of the visitors who claimed that the water helped his ailing wife, built the first, shallow spa pool. The pathways and wooden bridge were constructed in 1985. In 2012-2014 two additional, room-sized concrete pools were built, also by the former visitors. One pool has bottom filled with sand. Construction of the third, roofed pool followed, so as the paved road and new, pedestrian mountain pathway. The water comes from the underground lake, some 30,000 thousand years old. Water is beneficial for the rheumatic and cardiac illnesses, when properly used (being still in the water and no more than three times a day with total of 20 minutes only). Just outside of the complex is another water spring (\\"third water\\", the Rzav and the spa being the first two). It allegedly helps with the eye diseases. The intake for the spring was built in 1975. Local ecologists opted not to place garbage bins, instead all visitors take garbage back with them. == Rzav == The remaining course under the name of the Rzav is less than 10 km long. It continues to the east as the natural extension of the Veliki Rzav around the Blagaja mountain, reaching the town of Arilje where it turns sharply for the last time, this time to the north, emptying into the Golijska Moravica. The Rzav drains an area of 575 km¬≤, belongs to the Black Sea drainage area and it is not navigable. == References == * Mala Prosvetina Enciklopedija, Third edition (1985); Prosveta; * Jovan ƒê.

The actor joined the cast shortly after leaving E Street, and he relocated from Sydney to Melbourne, where the show is filmed. He made his first appearance during the episode broadcast on 7 December 1990. Glen was introduced as the secret son of series regular Jim Robinson (Alan Dale). He came to Erinsborough to meet his father and to ask for money to pay for his mother's funeral. The character was portrayed as being independent, mature and strong. One of Glen's most notable storylines featured an inappropriate relationship between him and his half-sister, Lucy Robinson (Melissa Bell). Scenes between them were edited out by the BBC upon their UK airing. Glen also had a romance with Gaby Willis (Rachel Blakely). Huggett decided not to renew his contract and Glen departed on 6 February 1992, following an accident which left him paralysed. ==Casting== Huggett joined Neighbours shortly after leaving his role as Sonny Bennett in E Street. On his arrival, Huggett said Glen was \\"very different\\" from Sonny. Huggett was forced to relocate from Sydney to Melbourne for the role and he revealed it had a negative impact on his personal life. ==Development== Characterisation Glen has been described as \\"independent, tough and mature beyond his twenty years\\". He is used to fighting his own battles. When his mother died of cancer, Glen was \\"full of grief for his mother and resentment for Jim\\". When Glen arrives in Ramsay Street, he assumes that Jim (Alan Dale) did not want to know him and he comes in a \\"fight-picking mood\\".Monroe 1996, pp. 43‚Äì44. Jim eventually persuades Glen that he knew nothing about him. Glen and Jim's oldest son, Paul (Stefan Dennis), do not get on and Glen resents the fact the only jobs he can get mean Paul would be his boss. Incest On of Glen's most notable storylines was his incestuous relationship with his half-sister Lucy (Melissa Bell). This was Neighbours' first incest storyline. Neither Lucy or Glen were aware that they were related after he arrived in Ramsay Street and before she returned home from boarding school. When Glen and Lucy meet they are \\"unable to deny the attraction between them\\". Glen and Lucy kiss and they are discovered in a compromising situation that angers their father, Jim. Of the storyline Huggett said \\"The story of Glen's and Lucy's growing feelings for one another might seem pretty audacious, but I think it works because it has been handled sensitively. It was a great acting challenge.\\" He added that incest was a brave subject for Neighbours, a family show, to tackle and that he was surprised about the reaction it caused. Viewers in Australia called Network Ten to complain about the storyline, which was branded a \\"scandal\\" and \\"one of television soaps' most daring encounters\\". Scenes showing the relationship were edited out and cut by the BBC in their UK airing. The scenes were later shown uncut in repeats on UK Gold. Relationships The character was part of the show's first \\"shotgun wedding\\" plot in 1991. Actress Fiona Jarvis was introduced as Karen Constintine, a woman Glen had had a one-night stand with prior to his arrival in Erinsborough. Karen informs Glen that she is six months pregnant with his child, so he feels that he has to \\"do the right thing\\" and proposes marriage. Chrissie Camp of TV Week observed that Glen's decision \\"has been the talking point of Ramsay Street for weeks.\\" The couple opt to be married at a registry office, with Jim and Harold Bishop (Ian Smith) as witnesses. However, as the celebrant talks about love and honesty, Karen grows \\"decidedly uncomfortable\\". Jarvis hoped viewers would sympathise with her character, as she reveals a secret. She explained, \\"Karen is hiding something, but basically she is a good person. She doesn't mean to hurt anybody.\\" Jarvis said that she enjoyed working with Huggett on the storyline, and admitted that she accepted the part of Karen when her agent told her he was a good actor. Producers established a romantic relationship between Glen and Gaby Willis (Rachel Blakely). Glen proves to be a big support when Gaby opens her own fashion boutique.Monroe 1996, p. 57. He encourages her to capitalise on a client with a famous name and they begin dating. A writer for Inside Soap said the couple had Ramsay Street's biggest on-off romance since Scott (Jason Donovan) and Charlene (Kylie Minogue). Following an argument, Gaby runs off with Guy Carpenter (Andrew Williams), but Huggett revealed that she is not serious about Guy and she soon returns to Glen, who proposes. Gaby accepts, making it Glen's second engagement, the first being to Karen Constintine. The characters do not end up marrying, and Huggett said \\"I don't want to give the game away, but it's pretty dramatic stuff, and it all ends in tears.\\" Departure In September 1991, Chrissie Camp of TV Week reported that Huggett had decided to quit the role. The actor's one-year contract ended in November and he chose not to renew it. Huggett wanted to pursue more \\"demanding\\" roles, and stated \\"I was always pretty adamant that one year is enough to be in one TV series. The thing that has changed in me is that I want to do material which means something to me, stuff with a harder edge. I suppose quality is what I mean ‚Äì not pumping it out like a sausage factory.\\" While repairing a roof at the Lassiter's Complex, Glen falls and is paralysed from the waist down. Josephine Monroe, author of Neighbours: The First 10 Years, said Gaby is as supportive of Glen as she could be, but \\"nothing could remove the chip on his shoulder the size of Ayer's Rock.\\" Glen then decides to leave Erinsborough for good. After his exit from Neighbours, Huggett told a writer for Inside Soap that working in soap operas was good training, but he would not go back to them. ==Storylines== Glen turns up in Ramsay Street to see Jim and he reveals that he is his son. He also explains that his mother Maureen Donnelly, who Jim had an affair with, has died of cancer. Jim is shocked and Glen realises that Jim had never been aware he existed. Jim wants to get to know Glen better and invites him to move in. Glen finds it difficult to fit in at first. Helen Daniels (Anne Haddy), Jim's mother-in-law, was shocked to learn about Jim's affair, but she gradually began to look on Glen as part of the family. Julie (Julie Mullins) and Scott accept Glen, but Paul refuses to and he and Glen fail to get on. Lucy is away at boarding school and she returns home before Jim tells her the truth about Glen. Lucy is attracted to Glen after she arrives home and finds him wearing nothing, but a bath towel. Glen is also attracted to Lucy, but he knows that she is his half-sister and he refuses to let anything happen. Jim tells Lucy about Glen, but they still end up kissing. Both of them realise what they were doing is wrong and stop things before they develop any further. Glen get a job as a barman at The Waterhole pub. Glen preferred working outdoors and he became a labourer with Doug Willis' (Terence Donovan) construction firm. Glen has a brief romance with Gemma Ramsay (Beth Buchanan). Karen Constintine shows up in Erinsborough and reveals that she is pregnant with Glen's child. Glen is shocked, but resolves to do the right thing and he and Karen become engaged. During their wedding, Karen confesses that Glen is not the father of her baby and leaves. Glen then began dating Gaby Willis after she comforts him on the anniversary of his mother's death. After a brief split, Glen proposes to Gaby who accepts. Just as the wedding plans were getting started, Glen fell from the roof of Lassiter's Hotel while trying to fix a banner for Paul. Glen is paralysed from the waist down, which devastates him. Feeling like he is a burden, he begins to reject Gaby's support. Paul begins acting differently towards Glen and Glen realises that Paul is terrified he is going to be sued. Glen initially wants nothing from Paul other than his medical expenses paid for. However, when Paul attempts to get Glen to sign a document wavering his rights to sue his company, Glen decides to sue Paul for a large amount of money. Glen finds himself alienated by his family. Karen returns, with her daughter, Rose (Alisen Merrey) when she hears of Glen's accident. Glen turns to her for support and falls in love with her again. Glen secretly agrees to take an out-of-court settlement from Paul and he flees Erinsborough with Karen. Jim and Gaby search for Glen, but they never find him. ==Reception== In 1993, Huggett received a nomination for Best Actor In Soap from the Inside Soap TV Awards. Peter Holmes of The Sydney Morning Herald branded Huggett \\"Neighbours' new sex bomb\\" upon his introduction. To celebrate the 20th anniversary of Neighbours, the BBC asked readers to nominate their twenty favourite obscure characters. Glen came in seventh place and the readers said \\"Jim's son that he fathered during a fling in Vietnam. Now not acknowledged as one of his children\\". The BBC also said Glen's most notable moment was \\"Falling from the roof at Lassiter's and becoming paraplegic.\\" In July 2020, Joe Julians of the Radio Times called for the character to make a comeback, citing his rivalry with Paul Robinson as the reason for a potential return. Julians wrote \\"If you're looking for someone with a personal grudge against Paul to inflict some drama into his life, you cannot get much better than Glen.\\" ==References== * ==External links== * Glen Donnelly at the BBC Category:Neighbours characters Category:Fictional bartenders Category:Fictional construction workers Category:Television characters introduced in 1990 Category:Male characters in television Category:Fictional characters involved in incest ","title":"Glen Donnelly"},{"id":"5599065","text":"Josephine Alhanko (born 24 April 1981 in Stockholm, Sweden) is a Swedish actress and former Miss Sweden title holder.

Specifically, buffy coat (WBC + platelets) is separated from whole blood, chemically treated with 8-methoxypsoralen (instilled into collection bag or given per os in advance), exposed to ultraviolet light (UVA), and returned to the patient. Activated 8-methoxypsoralen crosslinks DNA in exposed cells, ultimately resulting apoptosis of nucleated cells. The photochemically damaged T-cells returned to the patient appear to induce cytotoxic effects on T-cell formation. The mechanism of such ‚Äúantitumor‚Äù action has not been elucidated. Photopheresis involving 8-methoxypsoralen was first described in a 1987 New England Journal of Medicine publication. Photopheresis is currently standard therapy approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Evidence suggests that this treatment might be effective in the treatment of graft-versus-host disease, though this evidence is largely observational and controlled trials are needed to support this use. Photopheresis has also been used successfully in the treatment of epidermolysis bullosa acquisita when all other treatments have been ineffective. Minimal observed side effects for patients receiving photopheresis include hypotension and syncope resulting from volume shifts during leukapheresis phase of treatment. Photopheresis is also used as an experimental treatment in patients with cardiac, pulmonary and renal allograft rejection, graft-versus-host disease, autoimmune diseases, nephrogenic systemic fibrosis and ulcerative colitis. ==See also== *Blood irradiation therapy == Notes  References ==  Supplemental references  3\\\\.

Service period: 30 June 1965 - 1 December 2006 (Posthumous retirement) He is revered as the \\"Hero of Nathula\\" by soldiers of the Indian army, who built a shrine in his honor. He was accorded the state of the saint by believers who refer to him as the \\"Baba\\" (saintly father). Many of his faithful - chiefly Indian army personnel posted in and around the Nathu La and the Sino-Indian border between the state of Sikkim and Tibet Autonomous Region - have come to believe his spirit protects every soldier in the inhospitable high-altitude terrain of the Eastern Himalayas. As with most saints, Baba is believed to grant favors to those who revere and worship him. He is said to be protecting the country even after death. ==Life and military career== Baba Harbhajan Singh was born into a Sikh family on 30 August 1946 in the village of Sadrana (now in Pakistan). He completed his preliminary education at a village school, and then matriculated from DAV High School in Patti, Punjab, in March 1965. He enlisted as a soldier in Amritsar and joined the Punjab Regiment(India).https://www.honourpoint.in/profile/sepoy-baba-harbhajan-singh/ ==Death and associated legend== He was martyred in 1968 near the Nathu La in eastern Sikkim, India. Harbhajan Singh's early death at the age of 22 is the subject of legend and religious veneration that has become popular among Indian Army regulars (jawans), the people of his village and apparently soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) across the border guarding the Indo-Chinese border between Sikkim and Tibet. The official version of his death is that he was a martyr of battle at the Nathu La, a mountain pass between Tibet and Sikkim where many battles took place between the Indian Army and the PLA during the 1965 Sino-Indian war.http://gallantryawards.gov.in/awardees/maha-vir-chakra Plaque at Baba Harbhajan Singh's shrine. According to legend, Singh drowned in a glacier while leading a column of mules carrying supplies to a remote outpost. His remains were found after a three-day search. His body was subsequently cremated with full military honors. The legend further claims that the late Singh helped the search party find his body. Many Indian soldiers have revealed that in the event of a war between India and China, Baba would warn the Indian soldiers of an impending attack at least three days in advance. During flag meetings between the two nations at Nathu La, the Chinese set a chair aside to honor him. As per common belief, any army official not maintaining a clean and disciplined attire is punished with a slap by Baba himself. His own attire which hangs in the display need not be cleaned by anyone as it gets cleaned by his own soul. ==Legacy== Baba Harbhajan Singh mandir He has come to be known as \\"Saint Baba\\". Every year on 11September, a jeep departs with his personal belongings to the nearest railway station, New Jalpaiguri, from where it is then sent by train to the village of Kuka, in the Kapurthala district of the Indian state of Punjab. While empty berths on any train of the Indian Railways are invariably allocated to any waitlisted passenger or on a first-come-first-served basis by the coach attendants, a special reservation for the Baba is made. Every year a seat is left empty for the journey to his hometown and three soldiers accompany the Baba to his home. A small sum of money is contributed by soldiers posted in Nathula to be sent to his mother each month and his village still remembers him as martyr and undertook the initiative to help his family . ==References== Category:1946 births Category:1968 deaths Category:Dayanand Anglo-Vedic Schools System alumni Category:Indian military personnel killed in action Category:Indian Sikhs Category:People from Kapurthala Category:People from Punjab, India Category:Punjabi people Category:Sikh warriors ","title":"Baba Harbhajan Singh"},{"id":"5599104","text":"Humppa! is a 2001 compilation album by El√§kel√§iset, mainly released to the Russian market. == Track listing == # Orpopojan jenkka (Sex & Drugs & Rock'n'roll) # Kuumaa humppaa (Hot Stuff) # El√§n humpalla (Living On A Prayer) # Pyjamahumppa (Sleeping In My Car) # Luikurihumppa (Personal Jesus) # Humppaa tai kuole (No Limits) # J√§√§k√§rihumppa (Final Countdown) # Sortohumppa (Tere Perestroika) # Humppaukaasi (We Will Rock You) # Jenkkapolkkahumppa (Faster, Harder, Scooter) # P√§√§t√∂n humppa (Enola Gay) # Aamupalahumppa (Tom's Diner) # Astuva humppa (These Boots Are Made For Walking) # Niilo Yli-Vainio tervasi potkukelkkani jalakset (Jesus Built My Hot Rod) # Humppalaki (Breaking The Law) # Kuka humpan seisauttaa (Who Will Stop The Rain) # Humppaleka (Viva Las Vegas) # Humpataan, jumalauta!

After two seasons with Linz, he went on to coach Croatian club NK Zagreb and spent two seasons there before moving to Dinamo Vinkovci in July 1976. In the late 1970s, he was also the head coach of the Yugoslav amateur national team, a team that consisted of players from the Yugoslav Second League, and won two regional and one continental title with the team between 1976 and 1978. At the same time, he spent almost four seasons at Dinamo Vinkovci (Cibalia) before returning to Austria in March 1980 to coach Sturm Graz. He spent one and a half season with Sturm and was then unemployed for a year before starting to coach Rapid Wien in July 1982. He led Rapid to three champions titles in the Austrian Bundesliga in 1982, 1983 and 1987 as well as to three Austrian Cup titles in 1983, 1984 and 1985. In 1985, he also led Rapid to the final match of the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, but lost the title with a 3‚Äì1 defeat against Everton. Bariƒá left Rapid for German club VfB Stuttgart in the summer of 1985 and coached the team until March 1986. After three months without a job, he returned to Rapid in June 1986 and went on to coach the team in the following two seasons, winning another Austrian Cup title in 1987. After leaving Rapid in June 1988, he was unemployed for five months before eventually continuing to work as the head coach of Sturm Graz between November 1988 and June 1989. 1990s After leaving Sturm, Bariƒá became head coach of SK Vorw√§rts Steyr, another team of the Austrian Bundesliga, for the 1990‚Äì91 season. In July 1991 he was engaged by Austria Salzburg. He led Austria Salzburg to two consecutive champions titles in the Austrian Bundesliga in 1994 and 1995, and also managed to qualify for the UEFA Champions League in 1994, thus making Austria Salzburg the first Austrian club to do that. The team finished third in their group behind Ajax Amsterdam and AC Milan. In the previous 1993‚Äì94 season, he led the club to the two-legged final of the UEFA Cup, but lost the title to Inter Milan with a 2‚Äì0 defeat on aggregate. He coached the Salzburg team until August 1995 and then he left due to differences of opinion between him and some players. He was jobless for a short time after leaving Austria Salzburg and then he worked as an assistant coach in the Croatian national team until the end of the 1996 European Championship. In July 1996, he became the head coach of Dinamo Zagreb and led the club to titles in both the Croatian First League and Croatian Cup in only one season he coached the team. In June 1997, he left Dinamo for Turkish club Fenerbah√ße, where he worked until March 1999. Bariƒá was then unemployed for a couple of months after leaving Fenerbah√ße and subsequently returned to his international career as the head coach of the Austrian national team between 1999 and 2001, giving up his position after Austria failed to qualify for the 2002 World Cup finals. 2000s In January 2002, he went on to coach Austria Salzburg for four months and was then jobless for two months until July 2002, when he was named the head coach of the Croatian national team after his predecessor Mirko Joziƒá was dismissed due to unsuccessful campaign of the team at the 2002 World Cup finals. Croatia national team In July 2002, Bariƒá signed a two-year contract with the Croatian Football Federation and was given a task to bring the Croatia national team to the finals of UEFA Euro 2004. His first match as manager at Croatia bench was a friendly against Wales on 21 August 2002 in Vara≈ædin. The match ended with a 1‚Äì1 draw, which was quite a disappointment. His competitive debut in the qualifying session for the European Championship was even less successful with a goalless draw against Estonia and one month later the team went on to lose 2‚Äì0 against Bulgaria. With diminished chances for advancement to the final tournament, Croatia now had to win as many matches as possible. The start in the year 2003 was successful, with an impressive 4‚Äì0 win over solid Belgium at home in Zagreb, followed by three consecutive wins, twice against the group underdogs Andorra and once against Estonia. The team had to achieve an away win against Belgium to secure at least a place in the play-offs, but failed to do that by losing 2‚Äì1. Nevertheless, they won the last match against Bulgaria by 1‚Äì0 and grabbed the second place due to a better goal difference from that of the Belgian team. In the play-offs, Croatia came to a 2‚Äì1 win on aggregate against Slovenia and qualified for the finals in Portugal. At the finals, Croatia was drawn into a tough group with defending champions France, England and Switzerland, and advancement to the quarterfinals was relatively unlikely. The team put all their hopes on the opening match against Switzerland, but failed to win as the match ended with a goalless draw. The second match against France started bad for the Croatian team as they were 1‚Äì0 down on the halftime after Igor Tudor scored an own goal, but a strong start into the second half and goals from Milan Rapaiƒá and Dado Pr≈°o put them 2‚Äì1 up in the first seven minutes. Nevertheless, France equalised with David Trezeguet's goal twelve minutes later and the final score was 2‚Äì2. Croatia had to win against England in the last group match to advance to the quarterfinals and managed to achieve a good start when Niko Kovaƒç scored the opening goal after only four minutes, but England managed to switch the lead 2‚Äì1 until the end of the first half with goals from Paul Scholes and Wayne Rooney in the last five minutes. In the second half, England went 3‚Äì1 up with another goal from Rooney and Croatian chances to put themselves in the lead once again were down to a minimum. Croatia managed to decrease England's lead when Igor Tudor scored for 3‚Äì2, but it took only six minutes before Frank Lampard scored the final goal of the match, leading England to a 4‚Äì2 win and eliminating the group third-placed Croatia from the tournament. Although the Croatian team's elimination was expected in such competition, Bariƒá's contract was not extended and he left as coach of the Croatia national team in July 2004. Albania national team After being without a job for nearly two years, Bariƒá returned to coaching as he was named the head coach of the Albanian national team in June 2006, after Hans-Peter Briegel was not extended his contract with the team. Bariƒá will stay as coach of Albania until the 2008 European Championship with hopes to take the team to the final tournament for the first time. Unlike his predecessor, Bariƒá will live in Tirana to closely watch the Albanian First Division (Kategoria Par√´) and its players. He debuted with a 2‚Äì2 draw against Belarus on 2 September. Then Albania went to lose 2‚Äì0 at home against Romania, but tha draws against Bulgaria and Slovenia and the wins 6‚Äì0 on aggregate against Luxembourg, showed the good work of the coach. Albania might have even won with the Netherlands in Tirana if an own goal of Dutch defender Melchiot would have not been disallowed by the referee. Baric values were shown even when he promised to renew the Albanian national team and somehow managed to do that. He left out of the squad captain Igli Tare, even though he was a player of Lazio. But he proved this decision right because the team managed to do really well without him. He also gave their debut to Tirana 19-year-old player, Jahmir Hyka, and 20-year-old Besa Kavaje player, Andi Lila. Not to mention 21-year-old Kristi Vanglei, who plays for Aris i Greece. But the Euro 2008 qualifying campaign ended in shame for Albania, following two heavy losses against Belarus (2‚Äì4 at home) and Romania (1‚Äì6 in Bucharest). Although Baric was suspended for these two matches and both were not directed by him, but by his assistant, he couldn't accept his player's behavior and announced his withdrawal although he had agreed to an extension of his contract some days before.

It is operated by STAR Infrastructure Development Corporation (STAR ‚Äì IDC). The expressway is a component of Expressway 2 (E2) of the Philippine expressway network, which also includes the South Luzon Expressway and Skyway. The expressway starts at the intersection with the Pan-Philippine Highway (also known as the Maharlika Highway) and the South Luzon Expressway in Santo Tomas and runs southward, near Diversion Road, to Batangas City. It passes through Malvar, Tanauan, Lipa, San Jose, and Ibaan. The expressway was opened on 2001, with its first segment built between Santo Tomas and Lipa. From 2008, it was extended toward Batangas City, and from 2010, the South Luzon Expressway is connected to STAR Tollway, further shortening travel time between Manila and Batangas. The Lipa ‚Äì Batangas City segment was a two-lane expressway until an addition of a second roadway between Lipa and the Ibaan-Batangas City boundary was opened in 2014. Damage on a bridge in the Ibaan ‚Äì Batangas City boundary caused by Typhoon Nina (Nock-ten) required the closure of the Ibaan ‚Äì Batangas City segment for bridge repairs, and diverting traffic to the parallel national roads. With increasing traffic demand in the Batangas City ‚Äì Bauan area and the Batangas Bay area, proposals to extend the expressway are laid out to decongest the existing routes through those areas. Two projects are proposed to extend the expressway to barangay Pinamucan, within Batangas City, and to the municipality of Bauan. Like the North Luzon Expressway and SLEX before the construction of Skyway Stage 3, STAR Tollway is separate from the SLEX network despite being connected with SLEX since 2010. ==Route description== STAR Tollway parallels most of the route of the President Jose P. Laurel Highway (N4), which spurs off from the Maharlika Highway at Santo Tomas towards Lipa and Batangas City, and the Ibaan-Batangas City segment of the Batangas-Quezon Road. The road mostly traverses rural barangays of the cities and municipalities it passes and also overlooks several mountains. Santo Tomas- Lipa View north from Malvar Exit STAR Tollway starts as the physical extension of South Luzon Expressway past the overpass with the abandoned Philippine National Railways (PNR) branch line to Batangas City and an access road for Light Industry and Science Park III at Santo Tomas. Until 2010, the toll road ended at Santo Tomas Exit. Spanning , the road widens for a short distance as it enters Tanauan, where the Tanauan toll plaza is located, before narrowing back to two lanes. The road then meets with Tanauan Exit, which serves the city proper of Tanauan. Past Tanauan Exit, STAR Tollway descends on a scenic curve before ascending on approach to Malvar. Entering Malvar, the road mostly passes rural areas, mostly containing large coconut plantations and small residential areas. Also, within Malvar, Mount Maculot can be seen on the right of the road and Mount Malarayat can be sighted on the left. Afterwards, it enters Lipa, and the road gradually curving before approaching Lipa Exit, which is an access to the city proper, and also to the nearby towns of Mataasnakahoy, Cuenca, and Alitagtag. The exit once served as the tollway's southern terminus until 2007, when STAR Tollway was extended southward towards Batangas City. Lipa-Batangas City STAR Tollway in Ibaan Past Lipa Exit, STAR Tollway is mostly dual carriageway, until it narrows in approach to Batangas City. Spanning , this segment was a two-lane expressway from its opening in 2008, until the second roadway opened on 2014. The roadways of this segment is concrete, with the southbound roadway the former two-lane expressway, that has been in bad condition with increased traffic demand. South of Lipa Exit, the road mostly runs through the rural barangays of Lipa. Then, it curves slightly on approach to San Jose. At Ibaan Exit, the road intersects San Jose-Ibaan Road at a diamond interchange where the expressway passes above grade. Past Ibaan Exit, STAR Tollway mostly runs an arcing route, traversing several rural barangays of Ibaan and paralleling the Batangas- Quezon Road from Ibaan to Batangas City. The road narrows back to two lanes at Sabang Bridge on the Ibaan-Batangas City boundary. The approach to Batangas City from Ibaan was a site of a fatal head-on collision between a jeep and a bus, that killed 7 in January 2011. The road becomes a 3-lane road, with a concrete Jersey barrier dividing the road, ascending in a cutting before following a straight course on rolling terrain up to the STAR Tollway's southern terminus at Balagtas Rotunda. The road widens at the Batangas toll plaza (also known as Balagtas toll plaza), narrows back to 3 lanes, and ends at the Balagtas Rotunda, a roundabout with Jose P. Laurel Highway, Batangas Port Diversion Road, and Batangas-Balete Road. ==History== Logo used from 2001‚Äì2017. Still used alternatively. In an effort to link the different Southern Tagalog provinces to the National Capital Region, the government with the cooperation of the Provincial Government of Batangas and with the technical and country developmental assistance of the Government of Japan through the Japan Official Development Assistance, made the STAR Tollway project a reality. The STAR Tollway I, from Santo Tomas to Lipa, was opened in 2001; STAR Tollway II, from Lipa to Batangas City, opened in 2008. It is currently fully operational for all motorists. It was opened as part of the Road Development Project of the government, linking the South Luzon Expressway to STAR Tollway onwards to the Batangas Port in Batangas City. The travel time from Manila to Batangas City was reduced to 2 hours when STAR Tollway II opened. The STAR Tollway Project I and II were funded by Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) and Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and implemented by the Department of Public Works and Highways ‚Äì Urban Roads Project Office (DPWH ‚Äì URPO). The STAR Tollway is now under the supervision of the Toll Regulatory Board (TRB) and it is being operated by the Star Tollway Corporation. Redevelopment The Santo Tomas ‚Äì Lipa segment of STAR Tollway in Malvar, before the rehabilitation project, that added an asphalt overlay on the existing roadway (2008) Announced by the concessionaire, STAR-Infrastructure Development Corporation (SIDC), on May 16, 2013, the STAR Tollway Upgrading and Rehabilitation Project began in July 2013 as announced by SIDC president Melvin Nazareno. Under the project, the expressway undergone several upgrade and rehabilitation on its roads and facilities in order to cope with the traffic demand of the expressway. The expressway redevelopment included asphalting the Santo Tomas ‚Äì Lipa segment, upgrading the Lipa ‚Äì Batangas City segment to a four-lane divided expressway, improvements on the toll collection system, installation of closed circuit television (CCTV) cameras for traffic monitoring, and addition of lighting on some segments.Star Tollway Upgrade and Rehab Set, Manila Standard Today, May 16, 2013. Retrieved September 14, 2018. The expansion of the Lipa‚ÄìBatangas City segment commenced in June 2013, and finished in June 2015 with adding of lights. Closure and Rehabilitation of Sabang Bridge Sabang Bridge, which connects the town of Ibaan and Batangas City, was closed to all traffic in December 2016 to repair damage of Typhoon Nina (Nock-ten), leaving Ibaan Exit to be the temporary south end of the expressway. On August 15, 2017, a partial re-opening of Sabang Bridge was conducted for Class 1 vehicles and on August 20, 2017, it was re-opened to all vehicle classes resuming full operations to and from the Batangas Exit. ==Future== Pinamucan extension (STAR Tollway- Pinamucan Bypass) A extension of STAR Tollway, is proposed by the Sangguniang Panlalawigan of Batangas as two priority projects that will benefit the province as well as Mimaropa. The proposed extension will increase economic growth in the Batangas Bay area and reduce congestion on existing roads in Batangas City. The project will cost , and will pass through the barangays of Tinga Itaas, Tinga Labac, San Pedro, Dumantay, Sampaga, Sirang Lupa, and San Isidro, all in Batangas City. The project, dubbed the Pinamucan Bypass Road is expected to be completed before 2021. Right of way acquisition and construction work began on August 21, 2018, with funding from the Batangas 2nd District engineering office. Bauan extension Another extension to Bauan, called the Batangas City‚ÄìSan Pascual‚ÄìBauan Road (originally Batangas City‚ÄìBauan Toll Road), is proposed by the Department of Public Works and Highways as an alternative to the existing national road between Batangas City and Bauan. The project is expected to decongest the existing national road, whose traffic demand reached beyond capacity due to roadside establishments, industrial areas, and the Batangas Port, and increase economic development in the Batangas City‚ÄìBauan area. The proposed alignment of the toll road will start at the present terminus of STAR Tollway at barangay Balagtas, pass through the northern rural barangays of Batangas City and San Pascual, and end at the national road to Mabini at barangay Manghinao in Bauan. The proposed toll road is being constructed as an at-grade bypass only, connecting with Diversion Road, with right of way acquisition and construction works started on February 21, 2018. ==Name and origin== On February 9, 2004, Congresswoman Victoria Hernandez Reyes from the 3rd District of Batangas authored the House Bill 2753, or also known as the \\"Act of Renaming the Southern Tagalog Arterial Road (STAR) to Apolinario Mabini Superhighway (AMS).\\" On May 15, 2007, President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo signed and approved House Bill 2753 to rename the Southern Tagalog Arterial Road to Apolinario Mabini Superhighway, after the Filipino revolutionary and Batangas native Apolinario Mabini, and it was made into a law, now called the Republic Act 9462 (RA 9462).BIS Online Query ==Technical specifications== *Name: Southern Tagalog Arterial Road *Concession Holder: STAR Infrastructure Development Corporation *Operator: STAR Tollway Corporation *Concession starting date: 2002 *Concession ending date: 2029 *Length: *Highway exits: 7 *Lanes: 4 (Sto.

Motorists with lost or damaged cards are penalized by paying the toll rate on the exit point with the addition of the rate from the farthest entry point (i.e. Santo Tomas and Batangas City). Toll collection for Santo Tomas Exit, however, are collected at the toll plazas on the road before the exit, i.e. the Tanauan toll plaza for northbound motorists, the Ayala Greenfield Estate toll plaza on SLEX for southbound motorists, and vice versa for entering vehicles. The expressway implements an electronic toll collection (ETC) system, the Autosweep RFID, using RFID technology. The ETC system is shared by the Skyway, SLEX, and NAIAX. ETC collection is done on dedicated lanes at the toll plaza, but also done on mixed toll lanes. { class= - !Class !Rate - Class 1 (Cars, Motorcycles, SUVs, Jeepneys) /km - Class 2 (Buses, Light Trucks) /km - Class 3 (Heavy Trucks) /km - } ==Exits== Malvar Exit STAR Tollway-Pinamucan Bypass Batangas City‚ÄìSan Pascual‚ÄìBauan Road ==See also== *Transportation in the Philippines *Department of Public Works and Highways (Philippines) *Philippine National Construction Corporation ==ReferencesExternal links== * *Projects: TRANSPORTATION Category:Toll roads in the Philippines Category:Roads in Batangas ","title":"Southern Tagalog Arterial Road"},{"id":"5599156","text":"The ADT Championship was a women's professional golf tournament on the U.S.-based LPGA Tour. The season-ending event on the tour, it became the LPGA Playoffs at The ADT from 2006 through 2008. ==History== The tournament was played in its final playoff form for the first time in November 2006; the champion of the event, Julieta Granada, won $1 million, the highest first- place prize in the history of women's golf. The event took place at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida. From 1996 through 2005 the tournament was a standard, 72-hole stroke play event. It had a purse of $1,000,000 in its final season, with a winner's share of $215,000. The playoff event in 2006 was the first time golf has ever used a postseason of any kind on any tour. Beginning in 2007, the PGA Tour also employed a playoff system. Through the 2008 season, the title sponsor was ADT, a worldwide supplier of electronic security and fire alarm systems, communication systems and integrated building management systems, with headquarters in Boca Raton, Florida. ==Successors== On October 16, 2008 it was announced ADT would not extend its sponsorship. Another entirely new tournament, the LPGA Tour Championship, took ADT's place on the LPGA schedule for two years in 2009 and 2010; it was succeeded by the CME Group Titleholders in 2011 ==Selection process== 2008 selection As in the two previous seasons, the 2008 season was split into two halves, with 15 players from each half qualifying for the ADT Championship using a performance-based points system. In addition, two wild card players were chosen at the end of the regular season; a total of 32 players competed in the ADT Championship. The first half began with the SBS Open at Turtle Bay and ended with the LPGA Championship. The second half began with the Wegmans LPGA and ended with the Lorena Ochoa Invitational, one week before the Playoffs. LPGA members qualified for the ADT Championship by accumulating ADT Points during each half of the season or by winning an automatic entry by winning one of 13 designated \\"winner\\" events‚Äîdefined as any event with a purse of at least $2 million‚Äîthroughout the season. The two wild cards were the top two players from the LPGA Official Money List who were not otherwise qualified after the Lorena Ochoa Invitational: Sun Young Yoo and Christina Kim. 2007 selection The selection process in the 2007 LPGA regular season was the same as in 2008, with the only differences being: * The first half ended with the Wegmans LPGA. * The second half began with the US Women's Open and ended at The Mitchell Company Tournament of Champions, one week before the Playoffs. * Only 10 \\"winner\\" events were held during the season. More details on selecting competitors for the 2007 Playoffs can be found at: LPGA.com. 2006 selection The 2006 LPGA campaign was split into two halves. The first half began with the SBS Open at Turtle Bay and ended with the Jamie Farr Owens Corning Classic. The second half began with the Evian Masters and ended with The Mitchell Company Tournament of Champions, one week before the Playoffs. The top 15 points scorers and one wild card from each half qualified for the Playoffs, making for a total of 32 players who will take part in the season-ending event. Most of the events on 2006 LPGA schedule were \\"points\\" events, in which the top twenty finishers were awarded points. In addition, all winners of the LPGA's majors and five limited field events, such as the HSBC Women's World Match Play Championship, automatically qualified for the Playoffs. Once the first half ended, and the first 16 players were awarded spots in the Playoffs, the point totals from the first half were wiped out, and the second half began with a fresh scoresheet, meaning points did not carry over from half-to-half.

At the end of the Round 2, the 16 players with the lowest cumulative scores from Rounds 1 and 2 continue to Round 3. The other 16 players are eliminated from the tournament. In the event of a tie a sudden-death playoff takes place. * Round 3: The remaining 16 players compete in pairs of two. Scores are wiped clean for all players, however starting position is determined by the cumulative score from Rounds 1 and 2, with the players with the highest scores starting earliest in the day and the players with the lowest scores starting latest. The eight players with the lowest scores at the end of Round 3 advance to Round 4. If a tie exists, it is settled with a sudden-death playoff. * Round 4: The remaining eight players compete in pairs of two. The players participate in a live draw where they pick which time slot they would like to play in with the first pick going to the low score and the final pick going to the high score. The player with the lowest score after Round 4 wins $1 million. As in previous rounds, ties are settled with a sudden-death playoff. ==Controversy surrounding $1 million prize== Most players have supported the tournament, though some criticism has been raised. Annika S√∂renstam, for example, commented that a player who had a great year, like S√∂renstam did in 2005, when she won 10 times, could miss the cut after round three, and not only lose the tournament, but also the title given to the player who tops the LPGA Money List for the year to someone not even in the List's top 10 at the event's start. S√∂renstam, as well as others, have suggested that only half the prize count toward the money list, while the other half be given as a bonus, and not counted on the money list. The LPGA said it would consider this before the 2007 event. No change was made for 2007. ==Possible revival of the ADT Championship?== On November 21, 2009, Golf Channel's Randall Mell reported in a blog post that the LPGA was in preliminary discussions to bring back the tournament in 2011. ==Winners== LPGA Playoffs at The ADT {  !YearDatesChampionCountryScoreTournament LocationPurse ($)Winner's share ($) - 2008Nov 20‚Äì23 Jiyai Shin   69-75-71-70  Trump International Golf Club align=center1,550,000  align=center1,000,000 - 2007Nov 15‚Äì18 Lorena Ochoa   70-70-66-68  Trump International Golf Club align=center1,550,000  align=center1,000,000 - 2006Nov 16‚Äì19 Julieta Granada  70-69-69-68  Trump International Golf Club align=center1,550,000  align=center1,000,000 } The total tournament score is not shown because that does not determine the winner.

Both platforms have beige windscreens and green canopies and support columns with red roofs along the entire length except for a small section at either end, where they have high mesh fences instead. The station signs are in the black name plates in white Helvetica lettering. The 2008 artwork here is called SOL'SCRYPT by SOL'SAX. It consists of glass mosaic panels on the platform windscreens and station house depicting various images of African-American heritage. Exits The station has exits on both the west (railroad north) end and the east (railroad south) end of its platforms. On the east end, each platform has a single staircase leading to an elevated station house beneath the tracks. It has a turnstile bank and token booth.

His father was a physician to the Prince of Wales and his mother was a Montagu; Wilmot's uncle was George Montagu, 1st Earl of Halifax. It was with the help of these connections that Wilmot probably became an army officer, serving in places such as Gibraltar in 1745. ==Army officer== It was Wilmot's regiment in Gibraltar that was ordered to travel to Louisbourg, to relieve the garrison of Louisbourg, which had been surrendered by the French in 1745. In 1749, Louisbourg having been handed back to the French, the British troops sailed down to Halifax, Nova Scotia, to come under the command of Governor Edward Cornwallis. While it is apparent that many of the troops of Gibraltar left Nova Scotia soon after, Wilmot stayed in Nova Scotia, having achieved the rank of major. In 1755, the British were successful in laying siege to Fort Beaus√©jour, and with war having officially broken out, Governor Charles Lawrence sent Wilmot, then a lieutenant-colonel, up to Fort Cumberland (Beaus√©jour's new name), to act as its commander. In 1758, Wilmot was in command of a brigade in Louisbourg, and in 1762 was sent to Quebec. ==Governor of Nova Scotia== Province House, which still is furnished with his Nova Scotia Council table) It was in Quebec, in 1763, where Wilmot received his appointment as Lieutenant-Governor of Nova Scotia, succeeding Jonathan Belcher. Only one year later, in May 1764, Wilmot was appointed governor of Nova Scotia following the resignation of Henry Ellis. It was not a grand time for such an appointment. One example of the province's problems at the time was that Nova Scotia was suffering from great debts and deficits. By the time of his appointment, Wilmot's health was already deteriorating, he having blamed the climate for his sickness. In fact, he had sent an application to ask for a return to the England, but never received a reply. Governor Wilmot died in 1766 after suffering from a reportedly bad winter. An elaborate funeral service was held for him in Halifax. He is buried in the crypt of St. Paul's Church (Halifax)). == Legacy == * Fort Vieux Logis was renamed Fort Montague * Wilmot, Nova Scotia * Montague River on Prince Edward Island, from which the town of Montague takes its name. * Wilmot Town (Canso, Nova Scotia) * Montague St., Lunenburg, Nova Scotia ==ReferencesExternal links== * * Past Lieutenant Governors * Category:Governors of the Colony of Nova Scotia Category:1766 deaths Category:Year of birth unknown ","title":"Montague Wilmot"},{"id":"5599217","text":"Zapp is the debut studio album by the American funk band Zapp, released on July 30, 1980 by Warner Bros. Records. The album's style was highly similar to Parliament-Funkadelic, as the band was working with and being mentored by both Parliament members William Earl \\"Bootsy\\" Collins and George Clinton during the album's production. The album was produced by Zapp frontman Roger Troutman and Bootsy. The Troutman family of the Zapp band had close ties with the Collins family, both being Ohio natives. This friendship proved instrumental in Zapp gaining a record deal with Warner Bros. Records in 1979. Zapp was recorded between late 1979 and early 1980 at the United Sound Systems in Detroit, Michigan, of which Parliament-Funkadelic frequented. The album reached #1 on the US Billboard Hot R&B; tracks chart for 2 weeks in fall 1980. The album has been cited as one of the definitive albums of early 1980s electro funk, bringing the genre to mainstream attention. The album has also served as a partial source toward the creation of the G-funk sound of hip hop music, which became popular on the West coast of the United States during the early and mid 1990s. Zapp was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in November 1980. ==Background and recording== During the late 1970s, Zapp was noticed by two longstanding friends of the Troutman family, Phelps \\"Catfish\\" Collins and William Earl \\"Bootsy\\" Collins who were both members of Parliament-Funkadelic in the early 1970s. Prior, Roger Troutman often played locally in the Ohio area with his brothers, originally forming the band 'Roger and His Fabulous Vels' at a young age in 1966. Impressed with Zapp's musical abilities upon seeing them at a live performance, they invited the band to visit the United Sound Studios in Detroit, Michigan where they subsequently wrote and recorded the demo for the song \\"More Bounce to the Ounce\\" which would later appear on their debut. George Clinton the front-man of Parliament-Funkadelic encouraged the band to present the demo tape to Warner Bros. Records, which ultimately led to the band's signing on the label in early 1979. The full album was ultimately recorded at the same studio between late 1979 and early 1980 and was released on July 28, 1980 under the Warner Bros. label.

It is served by the Z train during rush hours in the peak direction and by the J train at all other times. ==History== Gates Avenue is the oldest station in the subway system to have been built as a rapid transit station; it has been serving BMT trains for approximately years. While Far Rockaway ‚Äì Mott Avenue is the oldest station currently in operation in the New York City Subway system, having originally opened in 1869 as a Long Island Rail Road station, that station had an 8-year disruption in service while being converted to subway loading gauge, meaning that Gates Avenue is the system's oldest station in continuous operation. Gates Avenue was originally opened by the Union Elevated Railroad on May 13, 1885 for the BMT Lexington Avenue Line, and has been in continuous operation since then. The BMT Jamaica Line connected to the station on June 25, 1888. Prior to the Dual Contracts, trains either operated down Broadway to Broadway Ferry (which closed upon the opening of the Williamsburg Bridge tracks to Essex Street) or Lexington Avenue, eventually merging onto the Myrtle Avenue El. The Dual Contracts expanded the BMT Jamaica Line, including Gates Avenue, to three tracks, allowing for express service, as well as expanding service in Manhattan down Nassau Street. In 1950, the Lexington Avenue El closed, resulting in the redirection of all trains to the Williamsburg Bridge. == Station layout== Western exit stair of northbound platform This station has two side platforms and three tracks with the center express track not normally used. Each platform has beige windscreens and red canopies (both with green frames) that run along the entire length except for a small section at both ends. The 2002 artwork here is called Dream Train by Chris Robinson and features mass transit-related stained glass windows in the station house and the windscreens. South of this station, the BMT Jamaica Line connected to the BMT Lexington Avenue Line before it ceased operation on October 13, 1950 and some remains are visible. The next stop on the Lexington Avenue El was Reid Avenue on its way to Downtown Brooklyn and Park Row, Manhattan. Exits The station has exits on both the west (railroad north) end and the east (railroad south) end of its platforms. Despite the station's name, there is no longer an open exit to Gates Avenue. On the west end, each platform has a single staircase leading to an elevated station house beneath the tracks. It has a turnstile bank and token booth. Outside fare control, two staircases lead to both eastern corners of Quincy Street and Broadway. The eastern exits are now emergency exits leading to both western corners of Palmetto Street and Broadway, just east of Gates Avenue. These exits were closed in the 1980s due to high crime. There is a closed station house around the intermediate level of the staircases. == References  External links == * * Station Reporter ‚Äî J train * The Subway Nut ‚Äî Gates Avenue Pictures * MTA's Arts For Transit ‚Äî Gates Avenue (BMT Jamaica Line) * Quincy Street entrance from Google Maps Street View *Platforms from Google Maps Street View * Gates Avenue Tower at Broadway Elevated Junction: Lexington Avenue Line (BMT) (New York Transit Museum; Flickr) Category:BMT Jamaica Line stations Category:1885 establishments in New York (state) Category:BMT Lexington Avenue Line stations Category:New York City Subway stations in Brooklyn Category:New York City Subway stations located aboveground Category:Railway stations in the United States opened in 1885 Category:Bushwick, Brooklyn Category:Bedford‚ÄìStuyvesant, Brooklyn ","title":"Gates Avenue station"},{"id":"5599230","text":"' () is a county located in central Fujian province, People's Republic of China.

He served as Archbishop of Glasgow from 1974 and President of the Bishops' Conference of Scotland from 1985 until his death. Winning was elevated to the cardinalate in 1994. ==Early years== Tom Winning was the oldest child of two born to a devout Roman Catholic family in Wishaw, Lanarkshire. His father, the son of an Irish immigrant from County Donegal, had worked as a coal-miner, served in the First World War, and was then employed in the steel industry. On losing his job, his father invested in machinery for making boiled sweets which he sold around the houses in the district as a way of bringing in money for his family. Winning attended St Patrick's Primary, Shieldmuir, Craigneuk. He served as an altar boySeenan, Gerard. \\"Scotland's turbulent priest\\", The Guardian, 18 August 2000 and chorister. Then, while at Our Lady's High School, Motherwell, he expressed the desire to become a priest. He successfully applied to study for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Glasgow and on acceptance was appointed to St Peter's Seminary, Bearsden, at age 17. == Priesthood == He began training in Saint Mary's College, Blairs, Aberdeen, where philosophy students of St Peter's were temporarily being housed and taught and then moved to St Peter's, Bearsden. When a fire in Bearsden destroyed the seminary during renovation works the entire college community was moved from there to St Joseph's College, Mill Hill, London. After the war ended, he was part of the first group of students to be sent to re-populate the Scots College in Rome. The College had been empty of students since 1939. He was ordained in the Church of St John Lateran, in Rome, on 18 December 1948. His father sold the sweet making machinery as a way to pay the fare for the family to go to Rome for the ceremony. His first appointment was as an assistant (curate) at St Aloysius, Chapelhall, Lanarkshire, but after a year he returned to Rome to study Canon Law, gaining in 1953 a Doctorate (DCL). Thereafter he was curate in St Mary's Church in Hamilton from 1953 to 1957 and from 1956 secretary to Bishop James Donald Scanlan of Motherwell. After a period in Our Lady of Good Aid Cathedral in Motherwell from 1957 to 1958 he became Chaplain to the Franciscan Sisters of the Immaculate Conception in Bothwell until 1961. At this point he became Spiritual Director at the Pontifical Scots College. Soon after his arrival in Rome, the Second Vatican Council was convened and he was therefore uniquely placed to be involved with the bishops during those historic years of the various Sessions of the Council. At the same time he continued his studies becoming an Advocate of the Sacred Roman Rota in 1965. In the late 1960s, after his return to Scotland, he was appointed minute secretary for the meetings of the Bishops' Conference of Scotland. In 1966 he was called back to Scotland where he was appointed to his first charge as Parish Priest in Saint Luke's, Motherwell, where he remained until 1970 when he was appointed as the first Officialis of the newly formed Scottish National Tribunal. == Episcopate == On 22 October 1971 he was nominated to the episcopacy, as Auxiliary Bishop to the Archbishop of Glasgow, being consecrated Titular Bishop of Lugmad on 30 November 1971 and three years later on 23 April 1974 succeeded Archbishop Scanlan when he was translated to the Metropolitan see of Glasgow. In 1975 he became the first Roman Catholic Archbishop to address the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in the history of that Church. After his appointment to the College of Cardinals (see below), he was invited once again to address the General Assembly. Winning was often outspoken, and unafraid to publicly expound the Roman Church's understanding of moral matters such as abortion and homosexuality (becoming a supporter of a campaign in 2000, led by businessman Brian Souter, against the repeal of Section 28, and ecclesiastical matters such as the celibacy of priests. He challenged the Act of Settlement. He also began a scheme to give financial support to young mothers, as an alternative to abortion. He rejected a plan to renovate and extend St Andrew's Cathedral, as the money would be better spent on the poor of the Archdiocese. He played a major role in bringing Pope John Paul II to Britain in 1982, a visit that was almost called off because of the Falklands Conflict that coincided with the visit. Winning is thought to have convinced the Pope to continue with the visit which was the first official visit to the United Kingdom by a Pontiff. ==Cardinalate== On 26 November 1994, he was elevated to the College of Cardinals by Pope John Paul II and appointed cardinal-priest of Sant'Andrea delle Fratte. Winning was only the second cardinal since the Reformation to be based in Scotland. He was awarded honorary degrees from the universities of Aberdeen (LL.D. 1996), Glasgow (DD, 1983) and Strathclyde (D. Univ, 1992); Glasgow University made him an honorary Professor in the Faculty of Divinity in 1996. He was appointed by Pope John Paul II to the Pontifical Council for the Promotion of Christian Unity and to the Pontifical Council for the Family, November 1994 until his death. ==Death== Thomas Winning died in office in June 2001, following a heart attack and is interred in the crypt of St Andrew's Cathedral, Glasgow. His successor as Archbishop of Glasgow was Mario Conti. In June 2011, two separate schools in Glasgow combined into one new school located in Tollcross which they voted to call Cardinal Winning after the late Archbishop of Glasgow. The new Cardinal Winning Secondary opened on Tuesday, 21 June 2011 and contains pupils from St Joan of Arc and St Aidan's, two schools located in Glasgow. ==ReferencesExternal links== The Scotsman 'Great Scots' Category:1925 births Category:2001 deaths Category:Archbishops of Glasgow Category:20th-century Roman Catholic archbishops Category:Scottish cardinals Category:Scottish people of Irish descent Category:People from Wishaw Category:Knights Grand Cross of Justice of the Sacred Military Constantinian Order of Saint George Category:Cardinals created by Pope John Paul II Category:Honorary Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh Category:People educated at Our Lady's High School, Motherwell Category:Post- Reformation Roman Catholic bishops in Scotland Category:Scottish Roman Catholic priests Category:Scottish Roman Catholic bishops Category:20th- century cardinals Category:20th-century Scottish clergy Category:21st-century Scottish clergy ","title":"Thomas Winning"},{"id":"5599251","text":"An engraving of George Washington created by Doolittle in 1794 Amos Doolittle (May 18, 1754 ‚Äì January 30, 1832) was an American engraver and silversmith, known as \\"The Revere of Connecticut.\\" His engravings included portraits and maps, made in his New Haven, Connecticut studio. He became famous for his four engravings depicting the Battles of Lexington and Concord, which were based on his first-hand reconnaissance of the battlefield. ==Life and work== Born in Cheshire, Connecticut on May 18, 1754, Doolittle became skilled in copper engraving through self-teaching and apprenticeship.Beardsley notes some learning from silversmith Eliakim Hitchcock of Cheshire. His first published experiment with the medium began when he enlisted in the New Haven company of the Governor's Guards in 1775. Under the leadership of Captain Benedict Arnold, the company arrived in Cambridge, Massachusetts ten days after the Battles of Lexington and Concord at the start of the Revolutionary War. Upon arriving in Cambridge, Doolittle took leave to inspect the site of the battle accompanied by Ralph Earl. Doolittle interviewed colonial militants and residents to establish the scene while Earl surveyed the site and made drawings. From these drawings, Doolittle made at least four engraved copper prints of the battle, which were advertised for sale in the December 1775 Connecticut Journal. The success of these prints marked the beginning of Doolittle's artistic career. He was sought out by many early Americans eager to learn the art of engraving, including James Wilson. Doolittle established a shop in New Haven, Connecticut, on the present-day site of Yale University's Old Campus, from where he created portraits, maps, and bookplates. Doolittle died on January 30, 1832 and is buried in the Grove Street Cemetery in New Haven. His younger brother Eliakim Doolittle (1772-1850) was a composer and schoolteacher. ==Gallery== File:Battle of Lexington Detail.jpgThe Battle of Lexington File:British Army in Concord Detail.jpgThe British entering Concord File:North Bridge Fight Detail.jpgThe engagement at the North Bridge File:Percy's Rescue at Lexington Detail.jpgThe British retreating from Lexington ==ReferencesFurther reading== * ==External links== * *American paintings & historical prints from the Middendorf collection, an exhibition catalog from The Metropolitan Museum of Art (fully available online as PDF), which contains material on Doolittle (no. 64, 68) *freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com Category:American engravers Category:American silversmiths Category:1754 births Category:1832 deaths Category:Burials at Grove Street Cemetery Category:People of colonial Connecticut Category:People from Cheshire, Connecticut Category:18th-century engravers Category:Artists from Connecticut Category:Doolittle family ","title":"Amos Doolittle"},{"id":"5599252","text":"Central logo Pune Central store in Bund Garden, Pune SoBo Central at Crossroads Mall, Mahalaxmi, Mumbai Central is an Indian department store chain operated by Future Lifestyle Fashion of Future Group.

It is the 3Œ≤-sulfate ester and a metabolite of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) that circulates in far greater relative concentrations. The steroid is hormonally inert and is instead an important neurosteroid and neurotrophin. ==Biological activity== Neurosteroid activity Similarly to other conjugated steroids, DHEA-S is devoid of hormonal activity, lacking affinity for the steroid hormone receptors. However, DHEA-S retains activity as a neurosteroid and neurotrophin. It has been found to act as a positive allosteric modulator of the NMDA receptor (50 nM‚Äì1 ŒºM), negative allosteric modulator of the GABAA and glycine receptors, and weak agonist of the sigma-1 receptor (Kd > 50 ŒºM). In addition, DHEA-S has been found to directly bind to and activate the TrkA and p75NTR ‚Äì receptors of neurotrophins like nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) ‚Äì with high affinity (around 5 nM). Hormonal activity Although DHEA-S itself is hormonally inert, it has been thought that it can be converted back into DHEA, which is weakly androgenic and estrogenic, and that DHEA in turn can be transformed into more potent androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) as well as estrogens like estradiol. As such, it has been thought that DHEA-S is a prohormone with the potential for androgenic and estrogenic effects. However, a 2005 study found that DHEA could be converted into DHEA-S but found no evidence of conversion of DHEA-S into DHEA. Other activity DHEA-S has also been found to inhibit the TRPV1 and TRPC5 transient receptor potential channels and to inhibit the P2X receptor. ==Biochemistry== Comprehensive overview of steroidogenesis, showing DHEA, the precursor of DHEA-S, at left among the androgens. Biosynthesis DHEA and DHEA-S are produced in the zona reticularis of the adrenal cortex under the control of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). DHEA is synthesized from cholesterol via the enzymes cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme (CYP11A1; P450scc) and 17Œ±-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase (CYP17A1), with pregnenolone and 17Œ±-hydroxypregnenolone as intermediates. Then, DHEA-S is formed by sulfation of DHEA at the C3Œ≤ position via the sulfotransferase enzymes SULT2A1 and to a lesser extent SULT1E1. Whereas DHEA is derived mostly from the adrenal cortex but is also secreted to a lesser extent by the gonads (10%), DHEA-S is almost exclusively produced and secreted by the adrenal cortex, with 95 to 100% originating from the adrenal cortex in women. Approximately 10 to 15 mg of DHEA-S is secreted by the adrenal cortex per day in young adults. Distribution Unlike DHEA, which is weakly bound to albumin, DHEA-S is strongly bound to albumin (i.e., with very high affinity), and this is the reason for its much longer comparative terminal half-life. In contrast to DHEA, DHEA-S is not bound to any extent to sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG). Whereas DHEA easily crosses the blood‚Äìbrain barrier into the central nervous system, DHEA-S poorly crosses the blood‚Äìbrain barrier. Metabolism DHEA-S can be converted back into DHEA via steroid sulfatase (STS). In premenopausal women, 40 to 75% of circulating testosterone is derived from peripheral metabolism of DHEA-S, and in postmenopausal women, over 90% of estrogens, mainly estrone, are derived from peripheral metabolism of DHEA-S. A study found that administration of exogenous DHEA-S in women who were pregnant increased circulating levels of estrone and estradiol. DHEA-S serves as a depot for potent androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone in prostate cancer, which fuel the growth of this cancer. The elimination half-life of DHEA-S is 7 to 10 hours, which is far longer than that of DHEA, which has an elimination half-life of only 15 to 30 minutes. Elimination DHEA-S is excreted in the urine via the kidneys. Levels DHEA-S levels throughout life in humans. DHEA and DHEA-S are the most abundant circulating steroids in the body. Plasma levels of DHEA-S are 100 or more times higher than those of DHEA, 5 to 10 times higher than those of cortisol, 100 to 500 times those of testosterone, and 1,000 to 10,000 times higher than those of estradiol. Levels of DHEA and DHEA-S vary throughout life. They remain low during childhood until adrenarche around 6 to 8 years of age, at which point they markedly increase, eventually peaking at around 20 to 30 years of age. From the third decade of life on, DHEA and DHEA-S levels gradually decrease. By the age of 70, levels of DHEA and DHEA-S are 20 to 30% lower than those of young adults, and in people more than 80 years of age, DHEA and DHEA-S levels can reach 80 to 90% lower than those of younger individuals. DHEA-S levels are higher in men than in women.

The routine use of DHEA-S and other androgens is discouraged in the treatment of women with low androgen levels due to hypopituitarism, adrenal insufficiency, menopause due to ovarian surgery, glucocorticoid use, or other conditions associated with low androgen levels; this is because there are limited data supporting improvement in signs and symptoms with therapy and no long-term studies of risk. In otherwise elderly women, in whom an age-related fall of DHEA-S may be associated with menopausal symptoms and reduced libido, DHEA-S supplementation cannot currently be said to improve outcomes. Childbirth As the sodium salt, prasterone sodium sulfate, DHEA-S is used as a pharmaceutical drug in Japan in the treatment of insufficient cervical ripening and cervical dilation during childbirth. ==Diagnostic use== DHEA-S levels above 1890 ŒºM/L or 700 to 800 Œºg/dL are highly suggestive of adrenal dysfunction because DHEA-S is made by the adrenal glands and also synthesized in the brain. The presence of DHEA-S is therefore used to rule out ovarian or testicular origin of excess androgen. Women with hirsutism commonly present with mildly elevated DHEA-S levels. Common etiologies for hirsutism include ovarian dysfunction (polycystic ovary syndrome) and adrenal dysfunction (congenital adrenal hyperplasia, cushing's syndrome, androgen secreting tumors); 90% of these cases are caused by PCOS or are idiopathic in nature. However, severely increased DHEA-S levels (>700 Œºg/dL) necessitate further workup and are almost stem from benign or malignant adrenal alterations. ==Chemistry== DHEA-S, also known as androst-5-en-3Œ≤-ol-17-one 3Œ≤-sulfate, is a naturally occurring androstane steroid and the C3Œ≤ sulfate ester of DHEA. ==References== Category:Androgen esters Category:Androgens and anabolic steroids Category:Androstanes Category:GABAA receptor negative allosteric modulators Category:Glycine receptor antagonists Category:Human metabolites Category:Neurosteroids Category:NMDA receptor agonists Category:Pregnane X receptor agonists Category:Sigma agonists Category:Sulfate esters ","title":"Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate"},{"id":"5599317","text":"Giuseppe d' Annibale (22 September 1815 ‚Äì 18 July 1892) was a cardinal and theologian.

The terms \\"positive\\" and \\"negative\\" do not refer to benefit, but to the presence or absence of a condition; for example if the condition is a disease, \\"positive\\" means \\"diseased\\" and \\"negative\\" means \\"healthy\\". In many tests, including diagnostic medical tests, sensitivity is the extent to which true positives are not overlooked, thus false negatives are few, and specificity is the extent to which true negatives are classified as such, thus false positives are few. A sensitive test rarely overlooks a true positive (for example, showing nothing wrong despite a problem existing); a specific test rarely registers a positive classification for anything that is not the target of testing (for example, finding one bacterial species and mistaking it for another closely related one that is the true target). There is usually a trade-off between measures. For instance, in airport security, since testing of passengers is for potential threats to safety, scanners may be set to trigger alarms on low-risk items like belt buckles and keys (low specificity) in order to increase the probability of identifying dangerous objects and minimize the risk of missing objects that do pose a threat (high sensitivity). A perfect predictor would be 100% sensitive, meaning all sick individuals are correctly identified as sick, and 100% specific, meaning no healthy individuals are incorrectly identified as sick. The terms \\"sensitivity\\" and \\"specificity\\" were introduced by American biostatistician Jacob Yerushalmy in 1947. == Definitions == In the terminology true/false positive/negative, true or false refers to the assigned classification being correct or incorrect, while positive or negative refers to assignment to the positive or the negative category.  Application to screening study  Imagine a study evaluating a test that screens people for a disease. Each person taking the test either has or does not have the disease. The test outcome can be positive (classifying the person as having the disease) or negative (classifying the person as not having the disease). The test results for each subject may or may not match the subject's actual status. In that setting: * True positive: Sick people correctly identified as sick * False positive: Healthy people incorrectly identified as sick * True negative: Healthy people correctly identified as healthy * False negative: Sick people incorrectly identified as healthy  Confusion matrix  Consider a group with P positive instances and N negative instances of some condition. The four outcomes can be formulated in a 2√ó2 contingency table or confusion matrix, as follows: == Sensitivity == Consider the example of a medical test for diagnosing a disease. Sensitivity refers to the test's ability to correctly detect ill patients who do have the condition. In the example of a medical test used to identify a disease, the sensitivity (sometimes also named the detection rate in a clinical setting) of the test is the proportion of people who test positive for the disease among those who have the disease. Mathematically, this can be expressed as: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\text{sensitivity} & = \\\\frac{\\\\text{number of true positives}}{\\\\text{number of true positives} + \\\\text{number of false negatives}} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[8pt] & = \\\\frac{\\\\text{number of true positives}}{\\\\text{total number of sick individuals in population}} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[8pt] & = \\\\text{probability of a positive test given that the patient has the disease} \\\\end{align} A negative result in a test with high sensitivity is useful for ruling out disease. A high sensitivity test is reliable when its result is negative, since it rarely misdiagnoses those who have the disease. A test with 100% sensitivity will recognize all patients with the disease by testing positive. A negative test result would definitively rule out presence of the disease in a patient. However, a positive result in a test with high sensitivity is not necessarily useful for ruling in disease. Suppose a 'bogus' test kit is designed to always give a positive reading. When used on diseased patients, all patients test positive, giving the test 100% sensitivity. However, sensitivity does not take into account false positives. The bogus test also returns positive on all healthy patients, giving it a false positive rate of 100%, rendering it useless for detecting or \\"ruling in\\" the disease. Sensitivity is not the same as the precision or positive predictive value (ratio of true positives to combined true and false positives), which is as much a statement about the proportion of actual positives in the population being tested as it is about the test. The calculation of sensitivity does not take into account indeterminate test results. If a test cannot be repeated, indeterminate samples either should be excluded from the analysis (the number of exclusions should be stated when quoting sensitivity) or can be treated as false negatives (which gives the worst-case value for sensitivity and may therefore underestimate it). == Specificity == Consider the example of a medical test for diagnosing a disease. Specificity relates to the test's ability to correctly reject healthy patients without a condition. Specificity of a test is the proportion of healthy patients known not to have the disease, who will test negative for it. Mathematically, this can also be written as: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\text{specificity} & = \\\\frac{\\\\text{number of true negatives}}{\\\\text{number of true negatives} + \\\\text{number of false positives}} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[8pt] & = \\\\frac{\\\\text{number of true negatives}}{\\\\text{total number of well individuals in population}} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[8pt] & = \\\\text{probability of a negative test given that the patient is well} \\\\end{align} A positive result in a test with high specificity is useful for ruling in disease. The test rarely gives positive results in healthy patients. A positive result signifies a high probability of the presence of disease. A test with a higher specificity has a lower type I error rate. == Graphical illustration == File:HighSensitivity LowSpecificity 1401x1050.pngHigh sensitivity and low specificity File:LowSensitivity HighSpecificity 1400x1050.pngLow sensitivity and high specificity == Medical examples == In medical diagnosis, test sensitivity is the ability of a test to correctly identify those with the disease (true positive rate), whereas test specificity is the ability of the test to correctly identify those without the disease (true negative rate). If 100 patients known to have a disease were tested, and 43 test positive, then the test has 43% sensitivity. If 100 with no disease are tested and 96 return a completely negative result, then the test has 96% specificity. Sensitivity and specificity are prevalence-independent test characteristics, as their values are intrinsic to the test and do not depend on the disease prevalence in the population of interest. Positive and negative predictive values, but not sensitivity or specificity, are values influenced by the prevalence of disease in the population that is being tested. These concepts are illustrated graphically in this applet Bayesian clinical diagnostic model which show the positive and negative predictive values as a function of the prevalence, the sensitivity and specificity.  Prevalence threshold  The relationship between a screening tests' positive predictive value, and its target prevalence, is proportional - though not linear in all but a special case. In consequence, there is a point of local extrema and maximum curvature defined only as a function of the sensitivity and specificity beyond which the rate of change of a test's positive predictive value drops at a differential pace relative to the disease prevalence. Using differential equations, this point was first defined by Balayla et al. Balayla, Jacques. \\"Prevalence Threshold and the Geometry of Screening Curves.\\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2006.00398 (2020). and is termed the prevalence threshold (\\\\phi_e). The equation for the prevalence threshold is given by the following formula, where a = sensitivity and b = specificity: :\\\\phi_e=\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{a(-b+1)}+b-1}{(a+b-1)} Where this point lies in the screening curve has critical implications for clinicians and the interpretation of positive screening tests in real time.  Misconceptions  It is often claimed that a highly specific test is effective at ruling in a disease when positive, while a highly sensitive test is deemed effective at ruling out a disease when negative. This has led to the widely used mnemonics SPPIN and SNNOUT, according to which a highly specific test, when positive, rules in disease (SP-P-IN), and a highly 'sensitive' test, when negative rules out disease (SN-N-OUT). Both rules of thumb are, however, inferentially misleading, as the diagnostic power of any test is determined by both its sensitivity and its specificity. The tradeoff between specificity and sensitivity is explored in ROC analysis as a trade off between TPR and FPR (that is, recall and fallout). Giving them equal weight optimizes informedness = specificity+sensitivity-1 = TPR-FPR, the magnitude of which gives the probability of an informed decision between the two classes (>0 represents appropriate use of information, 0 represents chance-level performance, <0 represents perverse use of information).  Sensitivity index  The sensitivity index or d' (pronounced 'dee-prime') is a statistic used in signal detection theory. It provides the separation between the means of the signal and the noise distributions, compared against the standard deviation of the noise distribution. For normally distributed signal and noise with mean and standard deviations \\\\mu_S and \\\\sigma_S, and \\\\mu_N and \\\\sigma_N, respectively, d' is defined as: : d' = \\\\frac{\\\\mu_S - \\\\mu_N}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{1}{2}(\\\\sigma_S^2 + \\\\sigma_N^2)}} An estimate of d' can be also found from measurements of the hit rate and false-alarm rate. It is calculated as: ::d' = Z(hit rate) ‚Äì Z(false alarm rate), where function Z(p), p ‚àà [0,1], is the inverse of the cumulative Gaussian distribution. d' is a dimensionless statistic. A higher d' indicates that the signal can be more readily detected. == Worked example  Estimation of errors in quoted sensitivity or specificity == Sensitivity and specificity values alone may be highly misleading. The 'worst-case' sensitivity or specificity must be calculated in order to avoid reliance on experiments with few results. For example, a particular test may easily show 100% sensitivity if tested against the gold standard four times, but a single additional test against the gold standard that gave a poor result would imply a sensitivity of only 80%. A common way to do this is to state the binomial proportion confidence interval, often calculated using a Wilson score interval. Confidence intervals for sensitivity and specificity can be calculated, giving the range of values within which the correct value lies at a given confidence level (e.g., 95%). == Terminology in information retrieval == In information retrieval, the positive predictive value is called precision, and sensitivity is called recall. Unlike the Specificity vs Sensitivity tradeoff, these measures are both independent of the number of true negatives, which is generally unknown and much larger than the actual numbers of relevant and retrieved documents. This assumption of very large numbers of true negatives versus positives is rare in other applications. The F-score can be used as a single measure of performance of the test for the positive class. The F-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall: :F = 2 \\\\times \\\\frac{\\\\text{precision} \\\\times \\\\text{recall}}{\\\\text{precision} + \\\\text{recall}} In the traditional language of statistical hypothesis testing, the sensitivity of a test is called the statistical power of the test, although the word power in that context has a more general usage that is not applicable in the present context. A sensitive test will have fewer Type II errors. == See also Notes References  Further reading == * * == External links == * UIC Calculator * Vassar College's Sensitivity/Specificity Calculator * MedCalc Free Online Calculator * Bayesian clinical diagnostic model applet Category:Accuracy and precision Category:Bioinformatics Category:Biostatistics Category:Cheminformatics Category:Medical statistics Category:Statistical ratios Category:Statistical classification ","title":"Sensitivity and specificity"},{"id":"5599331","text":"Patrina loukoumia or loukoumia Patron (Greek ŒõŒøœÖŒ∫ŒøœÖŒºŒπŒ± Œ†Œ±œÑœÅœéŒΩ) is Turkish Delight (lukum) produced in Patras, Greece. At the early 20th century, there was one major producer, the \\"Aggelopouloi Bros\\" company. The company closed in the early 1990s. The \\"Aggelopouloi Bros\\" were the birthplace of the long tradition of Patrina Loukoumia. In 1916, a young man, Vassilios Manoussos (1900‚Äì1986) moved to Patras from a nearby village to work for \\"Aggelopouloi Bros\\" and learn to make loukoumi. He started producing his own in 1925 and sold it in the streets, or by visiting confectionery shops, door to door. After World War II, he started making chalk, much in need for new schools, but soon moved back to making loukoumia. The family later moved to a small warehouse and then to a bigger one in Pantanassis Street, in the centre of Patras. In the 1950s, a new and larger factory was built in Agyia. The company was named V. Manoussos & Sons (Œí. ŒúŒ±ŒΩŒøœçœÉŒøœÇ & Œ•ŒπŒøŒØ). Later, it started using the trademark Achaiki (ŒëœáŒ±œäŒ∫ŒÆ) 'of Achaia'. Vassilios Manoussos introduced boukies loukoumia, bite-sized pieces remaining from cutting and packing loukoumi. These cuttings were usually melted into the next loukoumi batch, but now they represent more than 30% of all loukoumi sales. Boukies (ŒºœÄŒøœÖŒ∫ŒπŒ≠œÇ) literally mean \\"small bites\\" or \\"nuggets\\". Manoussos also produced Rahat brand loukoumi for the Gloria company. Patrina Loukoumia come in three original colours and flavours: red with rose flavour, white with mastic flavour, and green with bergamot flavour. Today there is a variety of new flavours, of fruits, and liqueurs. Manoussos added other products: koufeta (Drag√©e), vanilla sweet, gum candies (valda type), and other sugared products (like mnimosinou candies). The company was inherited by Vassilios's sons, and ceased operations in 2000. Achaiki was the first Greek producer of loukoumia that owned a web page showcasing its products. ==References== Category:Greek cuisine ","title":"Patrina loukoumia"},{"id":"5599344","text":"Midanbury is a small suburb of Southampton, England, bordering Bitterne, Bitterne Park and Townhill Park. ==History== In 1790 Southampton was a spa town whose popularity led to the construction of several country houses in the surrounding area, one of which was at Midanbury, situated on the summit of a hill to the east of the town. Known by a variety of names (Midanbury House, Midanbury Heights and Midanbury Lodge among them), the house was built by Mr T Leversuch. A writer in 1878 praised the beauty of the countryside, and the \\"exceedingly fine\\" views from the Midanbury Heights. The opening of the toll- free Cobden Bridge in 1883 enabled the townsfolk to travel across the river where Midanbury House, with its castellated lodge and crenellated gateway, particularly captured the imagination. As a result the estate's grounds became a popular venue for Sunday School outings from the town's churches, featuring picnic tables and a variety of games, including Cricket matches played by the adults. The house's lodge was built circa 1800 as a direct copy of that at Blaise Castle near Bristol which was designed by John Nash. It had battlements and turrets, arrow slits, window panes in the gothic style, and was topped with a crest. The building came to be known as Midanbury Castle, and served as accommodation for servants of the main house. Among the last to live there were the coachman-gardener Herbert Grosvenor and his wife, the housekeeper, Alice. Michael Hoy, a merchant of Bishopsgate, London and later Walthamstow (then in Essex) who specialised in trading with Russia, purchased several properties in Hampshire and the Isle of Wight, including Midanbury House. He served the office of Sheriff of London in 1812, having been elected to the Worshipful Company of Ironmongers on 22 April 1808. Hoy married Elizabeth, the second daughter of Andrew Hawes Bradley of Gore Court near Sittingbourne, Kent, on 24 May 1825 in South Stoneham Church (although the register lists his name as Michael Hay). Hoy died just three years later, on 26 June 1828, and left his estate to a distant cousin, the Dublin-born James Barlow, a military surgeon. Barlow took on the name Hoy as a mark of respect, becoming James Barlow Hoy by royal licence on 26 January 1829. James Barlow Hoy announced his candidacy to be a Member of Parliament for the Southampton constituency in 1829 and gave his first speech from Midanbury. Hoy was subsequently elected to Parliament on 13 January 1830, and re-elected in a general election later that year. He trailed in the polls for the 1831 election and pulled out, but was elected again in 1832 and once more in 1835. He subsequently moved to Thornhill Park, also in Southampton, but as of 1833 was still at Midanbury and also serving as Sheriff of Southampton. Hoy died in 1843 of tetanus resulting from a shooting accident in the Pyrenees. In the mid-19th century the estate was held by Charles John Middleton as a Copyhold tenure. Middleton also owned a share of a freehold property in Jamaica and subsequently purchased two houses in Kolkata (then known as Calcutta) in India. He mortgaged Midanbury in January 1843 and died in the same month of the next year with debts larger than the value of his estate. The Castle pub in 2011, before its closure and conversion to a convenience store The lodge fell into disuse in 1913; the house being purchased by a builder, T Clark & Son, in 1927 for development. In the 1930s the main house and lodge were demolished to make way for housing. Coopers Brewery built a pub, The Castle, on the site of the house in 1935, which was converted into a Tesco Express convenience store in 2013. The naturalist Chris Packham grew up in the suburb. == Government == Midanbury is located within the Bitterne Park ward of Southampton, which is a unitary authority. Bitterne Park returns three councillors onto Southampton City Council. As at August 2015, all three represent the Conservative Party. The area forms part of the Southampton Itchen parliamentary constituency, whose member of parliament is Royston Smith, another Conservative, as at May 2019. == Geography == In common with many city suburbs the boundaries of Midanbury are not well defined since the housing built on the Midanbury estate was constructed around the same time as surrounding areas and the old boundaries were not marked. The focal point of Midanbury today is small parade of shops at the top of Witts Hill, adjacent to the site of Midanbury Castle. == References == Category:Areas of Southampton ","title":"Midanbury"},{"id":"5599347","text":"The 2006 Clipsal 500 Adelaide was the first round of the 2006 V8 Supercar Championship Series.

As in the case of most V8 Supercar races, there was a Top Ten Shootout which could make the person that qualified first drop to tenth and vice versa. Kiwi Jason Richards, in his Tasman Motorsport Holden qualified first. Top Ten Shootout The official name for the winner of the top team shootout winner is the Armor-All Pole Position Award. The Top Ten Shootout also took place on the Friday. The person who finished tenth in qualifying goes first, and First goes last. The drivers get only one lap to record their best time. The Holden Racing Team got a one-two result in this, with Mark Skaife finishing first and Todd Kelly finishing second. The Lion (Holden) dominated the top ten shootout with 8 of the 10 drivers driving a VZ Commodore. There were only two Ford's in the Top Ten, Team Triple 888's Jamie Whincup and Craig Lowndes.

It was published by CrossGen Entertainment from April to December 2003. It ran for eight issues until it was cancelled when Crossgen went bankrupt in 2004. Solus was a late comer to the Crossgen line-up but was a pivotal title within the overall Sigilverse history. ==Plot synopsis== Solus told a story which was integral to the Sigilverse. The main character, Solusandra, was the creator of the Sigil-Bearers. She was an Atlantean who had undergone transition. She was allowed to \\"play\\" in a part of the galaxy and she used her powers to create The First, demi-gods with great powers. The strongest of these demi-gods and her special friend was Altwaal. She gave Altwaal seven weapons, called Altwaal's Weapons, which seem to be the most powerful artifacts in the galaxy. Not long after she created the First, she left them (for reasons never explained) and so when she returned (in Solus #5) she was not recognized. More recently, Solusandra was convinced by Danik to work with him in creating Sigil-Bearers. These modified humans were given great power (the ability to control and use the universal cosmic power). The purpose of the Sigil-Bearers was (eventually) to free Solusandra and defeat the other fully ascended Atlanteans. There were some disagreements between Danik and Solusandra in creating the Sigil-bearers. For example, Danik did not approve of Mordath as a Sigil-bearer, but Solusandra overruled him. The other ascended Atlanteans figured out that Solusandra was doing something dangerous to them, so they attacked her. Unfortunately, their attack resulted in disaster. They all died, and Solusandra was nearly killed as well. She lost all of her memories and \\"died\\" on a dead planet, leaving Danik as the only \\"God\\". However, after some years Solusandra revived and found her world filled with life and many glowing, floating bubbles containing her sign, the sigil. With her memory gone, she touched a sigil-bubble and was transported to the location of one of the sigil-bearers, a computer game designer named Lindy Karsten. When Solusandra touches Lindy's sigil, suddenly Solusandra gains a portion of her memories back (and Lindy loses her Sigil and her powers). Lindy is very distressed to lose her sigil powers and so she follows Solusandra back through the portal onto Solusandra's world. The remaining episodes show Solusandra visiting other sigil-bearers (Brath Mac Garen, Mikos of Abyelos, Kellra Tuskin, and Giselle Villard). Each time, Solusandra gains more memories, except for Kellra Tuskin: she nearly drives Solusandra insane (#7). Solusandra also visits Elysia, home of The First to take back some of Atlwaal's weapons (the weapons also give Solusandra some memories back). Early on, Solusandra destroyed Lindy Karsten's mentor (a fragment of Danik) called Infoe. This death told Danik that something powerful was awake but nothing more. So Danik created a hound (looking like a huge skeleton of a dog made of flame - see the cover of Solus #2). This hound chased Solusandra through several worlds, finally Solusandra destroyed (?) the hound and directly notified Danik of her location. In the last episode (#8) Solusandra meets with Danik, her one-time ally, who restores all (?) her memories. Solusandra then sends Lindy Karsten away and swears that she will fight the Negation. ==Collections== CrossGen announced two book titles for future trade paperback books that would collect the Solus series but these books were never published due to CrossGen's bankruptcy. *Solus Volume 1: Genesis *Solus Volume 2: Radiant Category:2003 comics debuts Category:CrossGen titles ","title":"Solus (comics)"},{"id":"5599373","text":"Robert Watson Claiborne, Jr. (1919-1990) was an American writer, folk singer, and labor organizer. ==Overview== Robert Claiborne, grandson of John Herbert Claiborne, was a folk singer and union organizer in the 1940s and 1950s. He travelled and performed with such luminaries as Pete Seeger, Woody Guthrie, Lead Belly and others. Along with his first wife, Adrienne Claiborne, he wrote the song Listen Mr. Bilbo and several others, and hosted a folk radio show for a time. As the Claibornes started a family, they both turned to writing to support it. Robert became an editor at Scientific American, only to lose his job in 1960 after the FBI visited and pointed out to the senior staff that he had been called before the House Un-American Activities Committee hearings as an ex-communist, and had refused to testify. They also pointed out that he was agitating against the then nascent Vietnam War, something often frowned upon in the early 1960s. In 1968, he signed the \\"Writers and Editors War Tax Protest\\" pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War.\\"Writers and Editors War Tax Protest\\" January 30, 1968 New York Post After losing his job, Claiborne found bread and butter work writing and editing some of the famous Time-Life series of science books. Among those he was a primary contributor to were The First Americans, The Birth of Writing, and Time. He also wrote a column for many years for Hospital Practice magazine. And he wrote or edited sections of highly-technical textbooks like Cell Membranes. In the mid-sixties, he divorced and remarried, to short story writer, novelist and political activist Sybil Claiborne. Science and linguistics Starting in the 1970s, Claiborne embarked on a series of independent book projects again focusing on science for the layman. One of the first: Climate, Man and History, was translated into many languages and became a seminal work in the canon of climate-anthropology. Another, God or Beast was also well received. The two of these together formed part of a matrix of work by many 'popular science' authors in the 1970s and 1980s that was at least partly responsible for the genesis of later popular science blockbusters by other authors, like the recent Guns, Germs and Steel by Jared Diamond. During this period, Claiborne also wrote books on amateur astronomy (The Summer Stargazer) and marine biology, man's impact on the marine eco-system, and its impact on his development (On Every Side of the Sea), as well as several others. Late in life, Claiborne turned to another lifelong interest: linguistics in general and the English language in particular. His Our Marvelous Native Tongue (also called The Life and Times of the English Language) is a well-known book about the origins and evolution of English, spanning subjects as diverse as the Indo-Europeans, the Saxons, the King James Bible, Pidgin English, and African American Vernacular English (also called 'Ebonics'). During this late period, he also produced Saying What You Mean, a practical guide for writers, researched by his daughter, Amanda Claiborne; the less well-received Roots of English, which included a fascinating 're-assembled' hypothetical Indo- European dictionary; and Loose Cannons and Red Herrings: a book of lost metaphors, about metaphors that have merged into common usage to the point that the source of their meaning is obscured. Death He died of a sudden heart attack in early 1990. He is survived by two children: Amanda Claiborne and Samuel Claiborne. ==References== Category:1919 births Category:1990 deaths Category:American folk musicians Category:20th-century American writers Category:American tax resisters Category:20th-century American musicians ","title":"Robert Claiborne"},{"id":"5599401","text":"Wiegand is a German surname.

Heteroduplexes are dsDNA molecules that have one or more mismatched pairs, on the other hand homoduplexes are dsDNA which are perfectly paired. This method of analysis depend up on the fact that heteroduplexes shows reduced mobility relative to the homoduplex DNA. heteroduplexes are formed between different DNA alleles. In a mixture of wild-type and mutant amplified DNA, heteroduplexes are formed in mutant alleles and homoduplexes are formed in wild-type alleles. There are two types of heteroduplexes based on type and extent of mutation in the DNA. Small deletions or insertion create bulge-type heteroduplexes which is stable and is verified by electron microscope. Single base substitutions creates more unstable heteroduplexes called bubble-type heteroduplexes, because of low stability it is difficult to visualize in electron microscopy. HDA is widely used for rapid screening of mutation of the 3 bp p.F508del deletion in the CFTR gene. == References == Category:Biochemistry methods Category:Biochemistry Category:Molecular biology ","title":"Heteroduplex analysis"},{"id":"5599416","text":"In molecular biology, an annexin A5 affinity assay is a test to quantify the number of cells undergoing apoptosis. The assay uses the protein annexin A5 to tag apoptotic and dead cells, and the numbers are then counted using either flow cytometry or a fluorescence microscope. The annexin a5 protein binds to apoptotic cells in a calcium-dependent manner using phosphatidylserine- containing membrane surfaces that are usually present only on the inner leaflet of the membrane. ==Background== Apoptosis is a form of programmed cell death that is used by the body to remove unwanted, damaged, or senescent cells from tissues. Removal of apoptotic cells is carried out via phagocytosis by white blood cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells. Phagocytic white blood cells recognize apoptotic cells by their exposure of negatively charged phospholipids (phosphatidylserine) on the cell surface. In normal cells, the negative phospholipids reside on the inner side of the cellular membrane while the outer surface of the membrane is occupied by uncharged phospholipids. After a cell has entered apoptosis, the negatively charged phospholipids are transported to the outer cell surface by a hypothetical protein known as scramblase. Phagocytic white blood cells express a receptor that can bind to and detect the negatively charged phospholipids on the apoptotic cell surfaces. After detection the apoptotic cells are removed. ==Detection of cell death with annexin A5== Healthy individual apoptotic cells are rapidly removed by phagocytes. However, in pathological processes, the removal of apoptotic cells may be delayed or even absent. Dying cells in tissue can be detected with annexin A5. Labeling of annexin A5 with fluorescent or radioactive molecules makes it possible to detect binding of labeled annexin A5 to the cell surface of apoptotic cells. After binding to the phospholipid surface, annexin A5 assembles into a trimeric cluster. This trimer consists of three annexin A5 molecules that are bound to each other via non-covalent protein- protein interactions. The formation of annexin A5 trimers results in the formation of a two-dimensional crystal lattice on the phospholipid membrane. This clustering of annexin A5 on the membrane greatly increases the intensity of annexin A5 when labeled with a fluorescent or radioactive probe. Two- dimensional crystal formation is believed to cause internalization of annexin A5 through a novel process of endocytosis if it occurs on cells that are in the early phase of executing cell death. Internalization amplifies additionally the intensity of the annexin A5 stained cell. Annexin A5 has been used to successively detect apoptotic cells in vitro and in vivo. Pathological processes in which apoptosis occurs include inflammation, ischemia damage of the heart caused by myocardial infarction, apoptotic white blood cells and smooth muscle cells present in atherosclerotic plaques of blood vessels, transplanted organs in the donor patient that are rejected by the immune system or tumour cells that are exposed to cytostatic drugs during chemotherapy. The non-invasive detection of diseased tissue with, for example, radioactively labeled annexin A5 is the goal of a recently developed line of research known as Molecular Imaging. Molecular Imaging of cell death using radioactive annexin A5 can become of clinical significance to diagnose vulnerability of atherosclerotic plaques (unstable atherosclerosis), heart failure, transplant rejection, and to monitor efficacy of anti-cancer therapy. ==References== Category:Laboratory techniques Category:Flow cytometry ","title":"Annexin A5 affinity assay"},{"id":"5599422","text":"Boryspilska () is a station on Kyiv Metro's Syretsko-Pecherska Line.

He was best known for his pace, trickery and long shots, and played for clubs in Brazil, Germany, Spain, Russia and Qatar. He made seven appearances for the Brazil national team and was selected for the 2001 Copa Am√©rica and the 2003 CONCACAF Gold Cup, finishing as runner-up in the latter. Three years after his retirement, The Versed wrote a report in 2017 about Ewerthon: \\"he was a forgotten entity on the continent, but for a while at the start of the millennium, he looked destined for the top. Sadly, as is the case with a fair number of South American migrants, he faded into footballing obscurity\\". ==Career== Corinthians Born in S√£o Paulo, Brazil, Ewerthon began his career at Brazilian club Corinthians in 1999, where he made thirteen appearances and scoring three times. Around at some point in 1999, Ewerthon was loaned out to Rio Branco, where he scored eight times in twenty‚Äìeight appearances. At the end of the 1999 season, he helped the side win both Brasileir√£o and Campeonato Paulista. In the 2000 season, Ewerthon formed a striking partnership with Luiz√£o. Despite suffering an injury around August, he returned to the starting lineup the following month. He helped them win the FIFA Club World Championship. At the end of the 2000 season, Ewerthon made twenty‚Äìtwo appearances and scoring eight times in all competitions. At the start of the 2001 season, Ewerthon scored twice, in a 5‚Äì0 win over Santos on 18 March 2001. He continued to be in a first team regular, playing in the attacking position. By the time of his departure, Ewerthon made sixteen appearances and scoring seven times in all competitions. Despite his young age, he impressed many fans and pundits in Brazil and attracted the attention of European clubs. Borussia Dortmund Borussia Dortmund were one of the clubs chasing his signature, and on 22 September 2001, Ewerthon signed for the club, signing a five‚Äìyear contract. The move reportedly cost ‚Ç¨7.5 million. Ewerthon made an immediate impact on his Borussia Dortmund debut when he scored and set up a goal for Jan Koller, who in return set up a goal for him, as Borussia Dortmund won 2‚Äì1 against St. Pauli on 29 September 2001. In a follow‚Äìup match against Borussia M√∂nchengladbach, Ewerthon set up the club's first goal of the season before earning himself a scoresheet, in a 2‚Äì1 win over Borussia M√∂nchengladbach. Since joining the club, he quickly became a first team regular under the management of Matthias Sammer. Ewerthon then scored three goals in three matches between 17 November 2001 and 1 December 2001. Later in the 2001‚Äì02 season, his goals helped the club secure the Bundesliga title for the sixth time in their history. During the UEFA Cup campaign, Ewerthon scored two times in the knockout stage against Lille and Slovan Liberec. In the first leg semi-final of the UEFA Cup, Ewerthon set up two goals during the match, in a 4‚Äì0 win over AC Milan. Despite losing 3‚Äì1 in the second leg, they reached the UEFA Cup final and played in the UEFA Cup Final which Dortmund lost 3‚Äì2 to Feyenoord at their opponents' De Kuip ground in Rotterdam. After the match, German newspaper Kicker said about his performance: ‚ÄúDid not enter the game at all, offensively without effect, was replaced. The only sign of life: When he initiated the counterattack, which led to the penalty.‚Äù At the end of the 2001‚Äì02 season, Ewerthon went on to make thirty‚Äìfour appearances and scoring twelve times in all competitions. In the 2002‚Äì03 season, Ewerthon started the season well when he scored three times in the first five league matches of the season. He continued to establish himself in the starting eleven for the side. Ewerthon made his Champions League debut on 17 September 2002, starting the match before being substituted in the 72nd minutes, in a 2‚Äì0 loss against Arsenal. On 26 October 2002, he scored a brace, in a 4‚Äì1 win over Werder Bremen. By the end of 2002, Ewerthon scored nine goals for the side in the 2002‚Äì03 season so far. He then added two more goals later in the 2002‚Äì03 season, including one against rivals, Schalke 04.

While she mainly sang punjabi folk songs, where she is credited for pioneering and popularising the genre, Kaur also recorded songs as a playback singer for Hindi films between 1948 and 1952.

The couple had three daughters, the eldest of whom is also a Punjabi folk singer. Kaur died in New Jersey in 2006 following a prolonged illness. == Early life == Surinder Kaur was born to a Punjabi Sikh family in Lahore, the capital of the Punjab in British India. She was the sister of Parkash Kaur and the mother of Dolly Guleria, both noted Punjabi singers. She had three daughters of which Dolly is the eldest.She was influenced by Renu Rajan, a prominent figure in punjabi folk music. == Career == Surinder Kaur made her professional debut with a live performance on Lahore Radio in August 1943, and the following year on 31 August 1943, she and her elder sister, Parkash Kaur cut their first duet, \\"maavan 'te dheean ral baithian\\", for the HMV label, emerging as superstars across the Indian subcontinent. Following the Partition of India in 1947, Kaur and her parents relocated to Ghaziabad, Delhi. In 1948, she married Professor Joginder Singh Sodhi, a lecturer in Punjabi literature at Delhi University. Recognising her talent, Kaur's husband became her support system, and soon she started a career as a playback singer in Hindi film industry in Bombay, introduced by music director, Ghulam Haider. Under him she sang three songs in the 1948 film Shaheed, including Badnam Na Ho Jaye Mohabbat Ka Fasaana, Aanaa hai tho aajaao and Taqdeer ki aandhi‚Ä¶hum kahaan aur thum kahaan. Her true interest however lay in stage performances and reviving Punjabi folk songs, and she eventually moved back to Delhi in 1952. In the decades to follow, she got married, after the 1947 partition of old British Punjab, in 1948. Her husband continued to guide her singing career. \\"He was the one who made me a star,\\" she later recalled. \\"He chose all the lyrics I sang and we both collaborated on compositions.\\" Together Kaur and Sodhi arranged for her to sing such Punjabi folk classics as Chan Kithe Guzari Aai Raat, Lathe Di Chadar, Shonkan Mele Di, and Gori Diyan Jhanjran and Sarke-Sarke Jandiye Mutiare. These songs were written by various well-known Punjabi poets but made popular by the singer Surinder Kaur. The couple also served as the public face of the Indian People's Theatre Association (IPTA), an arm of the Indian Communist party in Punjab, spreading messages of peace and love to the most remote villages of East Punjab. She also travelled to many parts of the world performing Punjabi folk songs, gaining rapid popularity. In all, Kaur recorded more than 200,000 songs, including duets with Asa Singh Mastana, Karnail Gill, Harcharan Grewal, Rangila Jatt, and Didar Sandhu.

Subsequently, on 22 December 2005, she suffered a heart attack and was admitted to General Hospital, Panchkula. Later, however, she recovered and personally went to Delhi to receive the coveted Padma Shri Award in January 2006. It is another matter that she was painfully aware of the events that delayed the honour for so long, despite her unparalleled contribution to Punjabi music. But even when she received the award, she was regretful that the nomination for the same had come from Haryana and not Punjab, India for which she worked tirelessly for over five decades. In 2006, a prolonged illness prompted her to seek treatment in the United States. She died in a New Jersey hospital on 14 June 2006 at the age of 77.

A champion of free speech, his art and criticism is associated with activism. His work is taught in Nigerian schools and recipient to many Nigerian and International prizes == Family and education == He gained degrees at the University of Ibadan (BA), the University of Leeds (MA) and York University, Canada (PhD, 1979). Previously professor (from 1989) and Head of English (1993‚Äì97) at the University of Ibadan, he became professor of English at the University of New Orleans in 1997. Osundare has a wife, Kemi, and three children, two girls and a son who still lives in Nigeria. His deaf daughter is the reason Niyi settled in the United States. She could not go to school in Nigeria so they found a school in the U.S. for her, and moved so as to be closer to her. He has been used in many schools as an example of a poet. == Career == He has always been a vehement champion of the right to free speech and is a strong believer in the power of words, saying, \\"to utter is to alter\\". Osundare is renowned for his commitment to socially relevant art and artistic activism and has written several open letters to the former President of Nigeria (Olusegun Obasanjo), whom Osundare has often publicly criticised. Osundare believes that there is no choice for an African poet but to be political: > \\"You cannot keep quiet about the situation in the kind of countries we find > ourselves in, in Africa. When you wake up and there is no running water, > when you have a massive power outage for days and nights, no food on the > table, no hospital for the sick, no peace of mind; when the image of the > ruler you see everywhere is that of a dictator with a gun in his hand; and, > on the international level, when you live in a world in which your continent > is consigned to the margin, a world in which the colour of your skin is a > constant disadvantage, everywhere you go ‚Äì then there is no other way than > to write about this, in an attempt to change the situation for the better.\\" Under the rule of the dictator General Sani Abacha (1993‚Äì98), Osundare regularly contributed poems to a Nigerian national newspaper (now part of the collection Songs of the Season) that criticised the regime and commented upon the lives of people in Nigeria. As a result, he was frequently visited by security agents and asked to explain his poems and to whom they referred: > \\"By that time I realized that the Nigerian security apparatus had become > quite 'sophisticated', quite 'literate' indeed!\\" > \\"A couple of my students at the University of Ibadan had become informers; a > few even came to my classes wired. And when I was reading abroad, someone > trailed me from city to city. At home, my letters were frequently > intercepted.\\" In 1997, he accepted a teaching and research post at the University of New Orleans. In 2005 Osundare was caught in Hurricane Katrina, and he and his wife were stuck in their attic for 26 hours. Their neighbour, who at the time was driving by in his boat, heard their shouts for help. They were rescued and bounced around from rescue shelters until they ended up in Rindge, New Hampshire, where Osundare could get a teaching job as a professor at Franklin Pierce College and things settled down. == Honors and recognition == Osundare is a holder of numerous awards for his poetry, as well as the Fonlon/Nichols award for \\"excellence in literary creativity combined with significant contributions to Human Rights in Africa\\". His 60th birthday literary fete took place at venues in Ikere-Ekiti, Ibadan and Lagos state of Nigeria in March 2007. His poem \\"Not My Business\\" is compulsory study in the AQA A syllabus for General Certificate of Secondary Education English Language. In 2011, an Associate Professor of English at The University of Lagos, Christopher Anyokwu, wrote an article on Niyi Osundare's Poetry and the Yoruba World View, where he analysed the use of Indigenous Yoruba concepts found in Niyi Osundare's texts. The associate professor, went further to assume that Osundare unified in his work the concepts and traditions of Yoruba culture and Marxist ideology. In December 2014, Osundare was awarded the Nigerian National Merit Award for academic excellence.

Each of these cars have 6 gears and AWD. These cars can be used in Rally and Crossover races in single player, and like all of the cars, can be used for any race in multiplayer. Group B The second category of cars is the Group B class, all of which are 5-speed monsters that accelerate quickly and are very difficult for novices to control. These cars all took part in the original Group B races. However these overpowered supercars of rally were retired in 1986. Most superrally stages feature Group B cars exclusively. Ice Racing Another class of cars is Ice Racing, used for racing on a slick bed of ice. Acceleration is the same as a conventional rally car but a lower gear ratio and only 4 speeds gives these cars a top speed of about 125 mph (about 200 km/h). Also, some of these cars have 4 wheel steering. Rallycross Rallycross cars are used for racing on closed circuit arenas at \\"high speeds\\". These cars are the fastest accelerating cars but slowest top speeds and if the gear ratios are set a certain way, cars may only go 100 mph. Hillclimb The fifth class of cars are the Hill Climb cars. They feature extra muscle in order to climb up and/or speed down mountain slopes. Hill climb cars top out the fastest at over 160 mph (about 260 km/h). Although tricky to control, these 6-speed muscle machines can be suitable for most rallies. Classics There are three classic cars in RalliSport Challenge 2. They are very similar to the Group B cars, except for slower acceleration and easier controls. ==Reception== The game received \\"generally favorable reviews\\" according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, where the game was ported on 10 June 2004, Famitsu gave it a score of all four eights for a total of 32 out of 40. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:2004 video games Category:Digital Illusions CE games Category:Rally racing video games Category:Video games developed in Sweden Category:Video games scored by Olof Gustafsson Category:Xbox games Category:Xbox-only games ","title":"RalliSport Challenge 2"},{"id":"5599517","text":"Bachiarius was an early fifth-century Christian writer, known only through his two writings which suggest he was a Galician monk. ==Writings== *\\"Liber de Fide\\" - an apologetic letter to the Pope. *\\"Ad Januariam liber de reparatione lapsi\\" - an appeal to an abbott on behalf of an incontinent monk. ==References== Category:Roman Catholic monks Category:5th-century Latin writers ","title":"Bachiarius"},{"id":"5599518","text":"Jade String Quartet is a Singapore-based professional string quartet.

When the house was built, it was paid a great amount of attention in the architectural world. The building is shaped like a cube, has four levels and is wrapped by a glass shield. All components can be segregated for recycling. There are no walls or closed rooms (apart from the bathrooms) and only few pieces of furniture. The transparency is supposed to create the impression that one lives outdoors exposed to nature. Owing to its passive solar architecture with triple-glazed walls, the house needs no energy for heating. Seasonal temperature shifts are balanced by a seasonal thermal energy store.

Weighing in at just 73 kg, and only 1.70m in height, Collins made a name for himself playing club rugby for Stratford and Clifton, and in 1927 was selected for the Taranaki Rugby Football team. He went on to make 81 appearances for Taranaki over the next eleven years, building a reputation as \\"a reliable last line of defence and an accurate goalkicker\\".‚Äù By 1932 Collins had caught the attention of the national selectors, making the North Island side for the North vs South match. He was selected for the All Black team to tour Australia, first donning the All Black jersey on 15 June in a preparation game against Wellington. Collins missed selection for the first test match, which was lost 21-17, but took over for the second in Brisbane on 16 July in which he contributed a penalty goal to New Zealand's 21-3 victory. He went on to play the third test match in Sydney which New Zealand also won. His overall tour performance was considered \\"creditable\\", scoring 54 points in his nine matches and kicking a penalty and two conversions in his two tests. No test matches were played in 1933, and Collins was again selected in 1934 for the tour to Australia. He played the first test in Sydney where the All Blacks were beaten 25‚Äì11. Collins could not play the second test due to injury, but played in the All Blacks vs \\"Rest of New Zealand\\" match when the team returned from Australia. This was his last game in the All Black jersey, having in those two years played 15 matches and scored 110 points. Collins retired from representative rugby football in 1937, and went on to serve as a coach and an administrator for Clifton Club, being honoured with life membership in 1970. A son, Bruce, played seven matches for Taranaki as a forward in 1962‚Äì63. Collins died on 11 January 1988, in Waitara. ==Bibliography== Chester, R.H. & McMillan N.A.C. (1994).

The case had been filed in 1980 by the American Civil Liberties Union's Reproductive Freedom Project on behalf of 8,000 women who had been sterilized under the program. The court ruled that the sterilization did not violate constitutional rights, and that though the statute on involuntary sterilization of \\"mental defectives\\" had since been repealed, it had previously been upheld as constitutional (in Buck v. Bell, 1927). However, the fact that state officials did not notify or provide subsequent medical services to the sterilized individuals was found to merit further consideration by the court. In a settlement reached in 1985, the state agreed to inform the women about what had been done to them and to help them get counseling and medical treatment. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:1981 in United States case law Category:Eugenics in the United States Category:United States district court cases Category:United States reproductive rights case law ","title":"Poe v.

He was ordained a priest in Baltimore, Maryland on December 13, 1838. Returning to New York he served on the mission at Utica and Ogdensburg, and then in New York City and at Belleville, New Jersey. In 1841 he was sent to establish the third parish in Brooklyn, and for this bought the unfinished building begun in November 1831, as the \\"Independent Catholic Church\\" by the Rev. John Farnan, who had been suspended by Bishop John Dubois. It was completed and dedicated on June 10, 1842, under the patronage of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin. In 1855 he was named first Bishop of Portland, and consecrated in St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York City, on April 22, 1855. There were only six priests and eight churches in the Portland diocese, which at that time included the entire states of Maine and New Hampshire. At his death the diocese contained 63 churches, 52 priests, 23 parish schools, and a Catholic population of about 80,000. In the summer of 1874 he started for Rome with Archbishop John McCloskey, but having fallen ill on ship-board was forced to remain in the Naval Hospital at Brest until the Archbishop returned, on his way home. Bishop Bacon was carried on board the steamer and barely reached New York alive. He was taken to a hospital on shore, where he died a few hours later. The bronze altar of the Sacred Heart, in St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York, was erected by Archbishop McCloskey in thanksgiving for Bacon's life being spared until he got back to the United States. ==References== *\\"U.S. Cath.

He began as a Realist, but later became an early promoter of various Modern styles, including Abstractionism. == Biography == H√∂lzel was born in Olm√ºtz. His father was the publisher, Eduard H√∂lzel. In 1868, he completed a three-year apprenticeship as a typesetter at the map publishing firm of F.A.Perthes in Gotha. Three years later, he and his family moved to Vienna where the following year he enrolled at the Academy of Fine Arts, moving to the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich, in 1876, where he studied with Wilhelm von Diez.Auszug aus dem Matrikelbuch 1841‚Äì1884, AdBK M√ºnchen The Love Letter; an example of his early work After completing his studies, H√∂lzel married and divided his time between Munich and Rothenburg ob der Tauber. In Munich, he became acquainted with Fritz von Uhde, who introduced him to Impressionism. Together with Von Uhde, Ludwig Dill and Arthur Langhammer, he helped create an art school, the Dachauer Malschule, in the nearby village of Dachau, which later became the keystone of the famous Dachau art colony. He lived there from 1888 to 1905 and his novel teaching methods drew students from all over Europe. In 1904, he participated in the first exhibition of the Deutscher K√ºnstlerbund. During his time in Dachau, H√∂lzel's work began moving toward abstraction, reflecting his interest in such principles as the golden section and Goethe's Theory of Colors. After studying the color theories of Wilhelm von Bezold, he developed his own color theory, based on a circle with \\"diatonic\\" and \\"chromatic\\" values (terms taken from music).Johannes Pawlik: Theorie der Farbe. DuMont Verlag, Cologne 1990, He was involved in creating the Munich Secession and the Vienna Secession. His influential essay \\"√úber Formen und Massenvertheilung\\" (On Shapes and Mass Distribution), was published in Ver Sacrum. After leaving Dachau, he still returned in the summer months to give private lessons. In 1905, H√∂lzel was appointed to replace Leopold von Kalckreuth at the State Academy of Fine Arts in Stuttgart and received commissions on religious themes from the Deutscher Werkbund. Despite abandoning Realism, he still felt that his paintings contained a strong element of religion. Among his students the so-called \\"H√∂lzel circle\\" developed, including Oskar Schlemmer, Willi Baumeister, Max Ackermann, Alf Bayrle and Johannes Itten. He constantly promoted exhibitions of Expressionist art and established a special painting school for women. Tired of the continuous opposition from his colleagues, H√∂lzel retired in 1919, but continued to give private lessons and work as a freelance painter. He died in obscurity in 1934, in Stuttgart. His personal papers have been preserved at the Staatsgalerie Stuttgart. In 2005, the non-profit \\"Adolf H√∂lzel-Stiftung\\" was created to preserve and promote his works. ==Selected paintings== File:Adolf H√∂lzel Komposition.jpgComposition File:Adolf hoelzel.jpgJourney File:Hoelzel komposition mit figuren.jpgFigures in a Landscape File:Komposition-in-rot.jpgComposition in Red File:Adolf H√∂lzel Anbetung.jpgAdoration == References == * == Further reading == * Marion Ackermann, Gerhard Leistner, Daniel Spanke (Eds.): Kaleidoskop.

Nothing now remains of the castle. The castle was also known as Canonry or Chanonrie of Ross, the former county. ==Construction== The Castle no longer stands. However, it is known that it was a rectangular tower house built by the Bishop Fraser between 1497 and 1507. ==16th century siege== In 1569, during the Marian civil war between the deposed Mary, Queen of Scots and James VI of Scotland, a feud arose between the Clan Mackenzie and Clan Munro, who were among the most powerful clans in Ross-shire. The trouble started when John Leslie, Bishop of Ross granted to his cousin Leslie, the Laird of Balquhair, the right and title to the castle at Chanonry together with the castle lands. Bishop Leslie had been secretary to Queen Mary and there was strong feeling against episcopacy in Scotland. He therefore felt it best to arrange for the church property of his bishopric to pass into his family's hands to preserve some of the important privileges that he enjoyed as bishop. Notwithstanding this grant, the Regent Moray (James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray), acting in the name of the infant King James VI, gave the custody of the castle to Andrew Munro, 5th of Milntown. Regent Moray, the illegitimate son of King James V of Scotland, promised Bishop Leslie that in return for ceding the castle and lands he would give him some of the lands of the barony of Fintry in Buchan. This scheme was interrupted when, in January 1570, James Stewart, Regent Moray was shot dead, preventing Andrew Munro of Milntown from obtaining the title to the castle and lands of Chanonry; but that did not deter Munro from occupying the castle. The Mackenzies were not pleased to see their powerful neighbours, the Munros, in possession of this castle; and recognizing the inherent weakness in Munro's title, or lack of it, they purchased from Leslie the legal title and rights and proceeded to demand possession of their rightful property from Munro. However, Munro would not cede. Munro decided to stay put and made a new approach to the new regent, Matthew Stewart, 4th Earl of Lennox who supported Munro. The situation became even more complex when Lennox was also shot and killed in September 1571. The next regent, John Erskine, Earl of Mar, subsequently also gave his approval for Andrew Munro to retain possession of the castle, but the Earl of Mar died in October 1572 after a short illness which some sources indicate was due to poisoning.Melville, James, Thomson, Thomas, ed. (1827). Memoirs of his own life. Bannatyne Club. pp. 248‚Äì249. The Mackenzies regarded the Munros as wrongful possessors of their property which they had legally purchased from Leslie. They therefore laid siege to the castle. The Munros defended the castle for three years with the loss of many lives on both sides. Finally in 1573 the Munros peacefully passed the castle to the Mackenzies under an Act of Pacification, under the terms of which Munro was awarded compensation for his expenses in occupying the castle. This affair was probably part of a wider political intrigue and the rival claims of the King's and Queen's parties, known as the Marian civil war, which ended with the 'pacification' of Perth in 1573. During the minority of James VI, which officially ended in 1578, Munro of Milntown, and his then chief Robert Mor Munro, 15th Baron of Foulis, had charge of the Crown lands of Ross and the Black Isle. On 31 October 1578, James VI gave the \\"castell, hous and place of the channonrie\\" to Henry Stewart, 3rd Lord Methven. The Chanonry had been given to Alexander Hepburn (d. 1578), the successor to John Lesley, Bishop of Ross, who shared Queen Mary's exile. Lord Methven would receive the income from the lands until such time as a new Bishop of Ross was appointed.Donaldson, Gordon, ed. (1963). Register of the Privy Council, vol.6. pp. 272 no.1693 In July 1589 James VI arrived at the Chanonry in person, where \\"he slew ane great hairt, and wes weill bancketted and ressavit by the barronis and gentilmen in the way.\\"Moysie, David.

Munro of Milntown also stated in his letter that the castle \\"was present in the handis of Walter Urquhard shereff of Cromertie\\" (at present in the hands of Walter Urquhart, Sheriff of Cromartie). Another letter, dated 8 July 1572, from a Richard Mader who was acting as a messenger, endorses an assurance to the king from the Munros and Mackenzies.Papers of the Munro family of Foulis, National Records of Scotland, ref: GD93/86. Retrieved November 3, 2018. It also mentions that the Mackenzies along with the Mackintoshes had laid siege to the Chanonry with three thousand men: \\"McKenze and Mcanetoische wes with thair haill hoistis to the nummer of thre thousand men or therby lying at the sege of the castell of the channory\\". Sir Robert Gordon (1630) Sir Robert Gordon (1580‚Äì1656) writes of the feud between the Munros and Mackenzies in his book A Genealogical History of the Earldom of Sutherland: > Clancheinzie grudgening, they bought the inheitance therof from Buquhayn, > and thervpon they besieged the castle of the channonrie, which the Monroes > defended and keipt for the space of thrie yeirs, with the great slaughter on > either syd, until it was delyvered to the Clancheinzie, by the act of > pacification. And this wes the ground beginning of the fead and hartburning, > which, to this day remaynes betuein the Clancheinzie and Munrois. George Mackenzie, 1st Earl of Cromartie (1669) George Mackenzie, 1st Earl of Cromartie wrote an account of the feud in his History of the Family of Mackenzie which was written in 1669. George Mackenzie says that the Mackenzies who occupied the steeple of the church made some attempts on the castle that was occupied by the Munros but to little purpose until June 1572 when it was heard that the Munros had gone out to fish on the Ness which was one of the debatable possessions. George Mackenzie goes on to say that the Mackenzies attacked the Munros, but that the Mackenzies were so few in number that they would have been overpowered and slain had not Robert Graham the Archdeacon of Ross come to the assistance of his friend Colin Mackenzie. George Mackenzie states that the Munros fled, three of them having been killed and that only two Mackenzies were wounded. Munro of Milntown then apparently came with considerable power to revenge the but 24 hours later Colin Mackenzie came with an even greater power that he could not resist. The result was that the castle was handed over to Walter Urquhart of Cromartie who was brother-in-law to Mackenzie and that Mackenzie was not to seek possession of it for twenty days in which time Munro of Foulis obliged Munro of Milntown that he should not make any attempt on the property and that he should only address the Regent Morton and the Lords on the matter. The Regent and the Lords later gave their approval to Colin Mackenzie. John Mackenzie of Applecross (1669) John Mackenzie of Applecross wrote his manuscript history of the Mackenzies at around the same time that George Mackenzie, 1st Earl of Cromartie wrote his and the two tally closely in details. It has therefore been suggested that they derive from a common source. Mackenzie of Applecross's account, like Cromartie's, states that the Mackenzies were supported and relieved by Robert Graham the Archdeacon of Ross during the skirmish. However, while similar to the Earl of Cromartie's account, Mackenzie of Applecross states that twenty- six Munros were killed and not just three, but agrees with Cromartie that only two Mackenzies were wounded. John Mackenzie of Applecross's manuscript states that after that skirmish the Munros were never able to keep out ye Castle, but delivered it to Colin Mackenzie on his return from Edinburgh because he had got all order of law against them. Alexander Mackenzie (1894/1898) Alexander Mackenzie wrote an account of the feud in his books The History of the Mackenzies (1894) and The History of the Munros of Fowlis (1898). Alexander Mackenzie repeats the story given by George Mackenzie, 1st Earl of Cromartie and John Mackenzie of Applecross that the Mackenzies and Mackintoshes occupied the steeple of the church and that an attempted sortie by the Munros for fish at a nearby loch was foiled. However, Alexander Mackenzie implies that the Mackenzies took control of the castle by force after the skirmish, contrary to the manuscripts which show that it was handed over. Alexander Mackenzie gives the number of Munros killed as twenty-six in accordance with John Mackenzie of Applecross's manuscript of 1669. He does however increase the number of Mackenzies wounded from two, to three or four, and adds that two Mackenzies were killed. ==17th and 18th century Civil Wars== Later during the Scottish Civil War of the 17th century the Mackenzies were was still in possession of the castle. Their chief George Mackenzie, 2nd Earl of Seaforth supported the Scottish Covenanters and in 1646 the royalist commander, John Middleton, 1st Earl of Middleton, laid siege to the castle and took it from the Mackenzies after a siege of four days. In 1649, after the Siege of Inverness (1649), the leader of the Scottish Parliamentary army, David Leslie, Lord Newark, left a garrison in the castle. However, soon afterwards the Mackenzies retook the castle from the Parliamentary forces. The Parliamentary forces responded by taking the Mackenzies' Redcastle and hanged the garrison. A 17th-century poem, written by Brahan Seer concerning the Castle Chanonry of Ross, predicted that: \\"The day will come when, full of the Mackenzies, it will fall with a fearful crash. This may come to pass in several ways. The Canonry is the principle burying-place of the Clan, and it may fall when full of dead Mackenzies, or when a large concourse of the Clan is present at the funeral of a great chief\\". The castle was reduced to rubble during the Jacobite risings in the 18th century, but it is not known who was responsible. ==In modern times== The castle itself no longer stands. However, the street it was on is now known as Castle Street. Nearby, built into the outside wall of an extremely old house is a stone known as a \\"Dormer Pediment\\", which shows a coat of arms and the initials CBS, which stand for Countess Barbara of Seaforth. Barbara was the wife of George MacKenzie, second Earl of Seaforth (1633‚Äì1651). This stone may be the only surviving relic of the castle.Castle of Chanonry blackisle.org.

On August 31, 1984, the Mets sent Lee, Gerald Young and Mitch Cook to the Houston Astros for Ray Knight. Houston Astros Lee would never play any games for the Houston Astros or any of their minor league teams, as he was left available in the 1984 Rule 5 draft, which was on December 3, 1984. The Toronto Blue Jays selected Lee in the draft. Toronto Blue Jays Lee spent the entire 1985 season with the Blue Jays, mostly appearing as a defensive replacement late in the game. He made his major league debut on April 10, 1985 as a pinch runner in a game against the Kansas City Royals, in which Toronto won 1‚Äì0. He had his first official at-bat on April 24 against Kansas City, striking out against Mike Jones. Lee recorded his first major league hit in his eighth at-bat, singling against Rick Behenna of the Cleveland Indians on June 2 at Exhibition Stadium. Lee finished the season with a .200 batting average with no home runs or RBI in 40 at-bats. With the Blue Jays winning the American League East, they advanced to the 1985 ALCS, where Lee went hitless in one at-bat, as Toronto lost to the Kansas City Royals in seven games. Lee would spend most of the 1986 season in the minor leagues, splitting time between the Knoxville Blue Jays and Syracuse Chiefs, where he hit a combined .256 with one home run. While with Toronto, Lee would hit his first major league home run, a solo shot off of Mike Smithson of the Minnesota Twins on August 29, 1986. Lee appeared in 35 games with Toronto, hitting .205 with one home run and 7 RBI. He would once again split the 1987 season between the majors and minors, appearing in 76 games with Syracuse, batting .283 in 251 at-bats, while batting .256 with one home run and 11 RBI with Toronto in 121 at-bats. Lee would become the Blue Jays starting second baseman in 1988, playing in 116 games, while batting .291 with 2 HR and 38 RBI. In 1989, Lee would split time with Nelson Liriano at second base, and occasionally fill in for shortstop Tony Fern√°ndez. Lee hit .260 with 3 HR and 34 RBI while appearing in 99 games, helping Toronto win the division and advance to the playoffs. In the 1989 ALCS, Lee appeared in two games, batting .250 while scoring two runs as the Blue Jays lost to the Oakland Athletics in five games. In 1990, Lee would get the majority of playing time at second base, batting .243 with 6 HR and 41 RBI, both career highs. In the off-season, the Blue Jays would shift Lee to become the starting shortstop, as they acquired second baseman Roberto Alomar in a deal with the San Diego Padres. In 1991, Lee appeared in a career high 138 games, hitting .234 with no homers and 29 RBI. Lee struggled in the 1991 ALCS, hitting only .125 in the Blue Jays five game loss to the Minnesota Twins. Lee returned as the Blue Jays starting shortstop in 1992, as he improved his hitting, batting .263 with 3 HR and 39 RBI. Toronto once again won their division, and faced the Oakland Athletics in the 1992 ALCS. In six games, Lee hit .278 with 3 RBI, as Toronto defeated Oakland to advance to the 1992 World Series against the Atlanta Braves. Lee struggled in the World Series, hitting only .105, however, the Blue Jays would defeat the Braves in six games to win the championship. On November 4, 1992, Lee was granted free agency. Texas Rangers On December 19, 1992, the Texas Rangers signed Lee as a free agent to become the team's starting shortstop. After missing the Rangers first eight games, Lee made his Texas debut on April 16, 1993, getting a hit and a run in a 5‚Äì3 loss to the New York Yankees at Yankee Stadium. Lee would battle injuries during the season, appearing in only 73 games, batting .220 with 1 HR and 12 RBI. He would rebound in the 1994 season, as Lee hit .278 with 2 HR and 38 RBI in 95 games with Texas before the season ended early due to the 1994 Baseball Strike. At the time of the strike, the Rangers were leading the American League West. On October 28, 1994, Lee became a free agent. St. Louis Cardinals The St. Louis Cardinals signed Lee on April 18, 1995. He made his Cardinals debut on April 26, 1995 against the Philadelphia Phillies at Busch Stadium. Lee earned a hit in his first, and only Cardinals at-bat, as he left the game in the fourth inning due to an injury. The Cardinals sent Lee to the minor leagues for a rehab assignment, where in 12 games, he hit .308, however, St. Louis released Lee on June 22. Lee announced his retirement shortly after. ==External links== Category:1965 births Category:Living people Category:Dominican Republic expatriate baseball players in Canada Category:Dominican Republic expatriate baseball players in the United States Category:Major League Baseball players from the Dominican Republic Category:Major League Baseball shortstops Category:Sportspeople from San Pedro de Macor√≠s Category:St. Louis Cardinals players Category:Texas Rangers players Category:Toronto Blue Jays players ","title":"Manuel Lee"},{"id":"5599662","text":"Roger Vitrac (; 1899 ‚Äì 1952) was a French surrealist playwright and poet. ==Early life== Roger Vitrac was born in Pinsac on 17 November 1899, before his family moved to Paris in 1910.:527 As a young man, he was influenced by the period's theatre and poetry, in particular the works of Lautr√©amont and Alfred Jarry.:527 In the late 1920s he married Kitty Cannell, a dancer and actress who performed at the Provincetown Playhouse.:265 == Career == In 1919 he published his first collection of poems, Le Faune noir.  Military Service  During his three-year-long military service, he was introduced to Dadaist performances in Paris. He became interested in the movement and 'took to distributing Dada manifestos in the barracks'.:358 He also 'presented a play in Dadaistic character' entitled La Fen√™tre Vorace, which has since been lost.:358 It was during this time that he met Marcel Arland, Fran√ßois Baron, Georges Limbour and Ren√© Crevel, and founded the literary revue, Aventure.:527  Association with the Dadaists and Surrealists  Vitrac met Andr√© Breton and Louis Aragon at Caf√© Certa in 1921, where many Dada activities took place until it became one of the surrealist group's headquarters. In 1921, Vitrac attended the Dadaist Excursion to the Church of Saint-Julien-le-Pauvre and become formally associated with the Dadaists. Vitrac joined the Surrealist movement and was one of the signatories of Breton's First Surrealist Manifesto (1924). He also contributed to the first few editions of La R√©volution Surr√©aliste, before being expelled from the movement in 1925.:527  Theater Alfred Jarry  In 1926, Vitrac founded the Th√©atre Alfred-Jarry with Robert Aron. and Antonin Artaud (who was also expelled from the Surrealist movement). It was here that Vitrac staged his premier play, The Mysteries of Love (Les Myst√®res de l'amour, 1927), as well as his best known work Victor, or Power to the Children (Victor ou les enfants au pouvoir) (1928).  Later works  Vitrac joined Georges Bataille as one of the signatories of Un Cadavre against Breton and contributed to Documents with articles on \\"Gaston-Louis Roux\\" (1929, issue 7), \\"The Abduction of the Sabines\\" (1930, issue 6) and a poem, \\"Humorage to Picasso\\" (1930, issue 3), dedicated to the artist. From 1931, he worked as a journalist while further exploring burlesque style playwriting, which often operated between boulevard comedy and intimate tragedy. His multi- thematic Coup de Trafalgar (1934) and Les Demoiselles du large (1938) gained as little recognition as his more slapstick plays such as Le Loup-Garou (1939) and Le Sabre de mon p√®re (1951). == Death == Vitrac died in Paris on 22 January 1952.:527 == Legacy == Only after his death did Vitrac reach popular stardom status with Jean Anouilh's 1962 production of Victor, or Power to the Children.

Hills, ‚ÄòHornblower, Jonathan (1753‚Äì1815)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 16 Oct 2007 was a British pioneer of steam power. ==Personal life== The son of Jonathan Hornblower the Elder and the brother of Jabez Carter Hornblower, two fellow pioneers, the young Hornblower was educated at Truro Grammar School. He was baptised at Trelever on 25 July 1773, aged 20 (he and his family were much involved in Baptist churches in Cornwall), and was apprenticed to a metal- working tradesman at Penryn.Jonathan Hornblower II at gracesguide.co.uk, accessed 10 April 2012 He married twice, first to his cousin Rosamund Phillips in 1775 and later to Elizabeth Jordan with whom he had two surviving daughters, Rosamund (1789) and Elizabeth (1790). He died on 23 February 1815 and is buried in St Gluvias Churchyard. ==Compound engine== He invented the compound steam engine in 1781 and patented it on 16 July in the same year. This type of engine has two cylinders instead of old single-cylinder engine, it contains a high-pressure and a low-pressure steam cylinder. The principle is that the steam first expands in the high-pressure cylinder and afterwards expands again in the low-pressure cylinder. Even though this was a revolutionary new steam technology, he was unfortunately prevented from pursuing his invention by litigation with James Watt (Boulton & Watt) over intellectual property. His compound engine principle was not revived until 1804 (by Arthur Woolf ) following the expiration of Boulton and Watt's patent. Hornblower's compound engine principle contributed significantly to the increases in steam engine efficiency, and it was the foundation of the expansion engine. ==Rotary engine== After the patent litigation with Boulton & Watt, Hornblower came up with an idea for a new kind of rotary engine. He worked on it for several years and patented it on 5 June 1798. The engine's construction was the most complex so far, but as before he ran into trouble with Watt's patents on these subjects. ==Double beat valve== He invented the double-beat steam valve around 1800. This valve is a type of poppet valve, it can open against a high pressure with a minimum of force, usually operated by trip valve gear. The valve was used in railway locomotives, beam engines, grasshopper engines and paddle steamers and became widely used during the 19th century. ==Steam-wheel== In 1805 Hornblower developed a steam-wheel. ==References== Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (2007): Jonathan Carter Hornblower. ==External links== *The compound engine *The Case Against Intellectual Monopoly by Boldrin & Levine * * Category:1753 births Category:1815 deaths Category:Cornish engineers Category:People from Chacewater Category:British steam engine engineers Category:People educated at Truro Cathedral School Category:Burials in Cornwall ","title":"Jonathan Hornblower"},{"id":"5599681","text":"Homosexual transsexual is a taxonomic category of transsexual individuals used in sexology, psychology, and psychiatry. It categorizes trans women who are exclusively attracted to men, and less often trans men who are exclusively attracted to women, based on their sex assigned at birth, rather than their current gender identity. The concept of categorizing trans women by sexual orientation originated with Magnus Hirschfeld in 1923, and was further developed by the sexologist Harry Benjamin in 1966 as a component of the Benjamin scale. The specific term homosexual transsexual was coined by Kurt Freund in 1973, and used from 1982 onward by him and others. In the DSM III, published in 1980, transsexualism was to be diagnosed and the sexual orientation of a transsexual specified using the terms homosexual, heterosexual, asexual, or unspecified. This convention had its origins in the taxonomic work of researchers like Hirschfeld, Benjamin, and Freund, which found that grouping trans women by sexual orientation reveals important qualitative and statistical differences between them. These differences have been maintained by various researchers as indicative or suggestive of multiple, distinct etiologies. The term homosexual transsexual has since been used in publications by a variety of academics, including Benjamin, Freund, Blanchard, and Anne Lawrence, as well as J. Michael Bailey and James Cantor, among others. Sexologist Ray Blanchard uses the concept in relation to one type of male-to-female (MTF) transsexual in his transsexualism typology developed in the late 1980s. The term homosexual transsexual has attracted controversy. It has been criticized from a lexical standpoint by Benjamin, Bruce Bagemihl, and John Bancroft as being confusing (though supported conceptually by the former two), as well as insensitive to the gender identities of those whom it is intended to describe. The alternatives androphilic and gynephilic have been proposed by Milton Diamond as descriptors for sexual orientation that do not make assumptions about the sex or gender identity of the person being described. Terms such as androphilia and gynephilia are sometimes used instead of, or concurrently with, homosexual, heterosexual, or non-homosexual in current research, such as research which has used the Modified Androphilia Scale to assess the attraction to men of a given trans woman. S. J. Wahng contended in 2004 that the term homosexual transsexual is \\"archaic\\". Though the term transsexuality was removed as a mental disorder from the DSM-IV and was replaced with gender identity disorder as a diagnostic label, attraction to males, females, both, or neither was specified in the DSM IV-TR. Most of the research on homosexual transsexuality has been conducted on trans women. They are usually socioeconomically disadvantaged, born later in a series of brothers, are unlikely to display cross-gender fetishism or autogynephilia, and come out at a younger age than non-homosexual trans women. Relatively little research has been done on gender variance in assigned women, and the prevalence of female-to-male gender identity disorder (GID) is less than that of male-to-female GID. ==Development of the concept== The term homosexual transsexual was defined by Kurt Freund in 1974, and is used by various sexologists and psychiatrists to describe trans women who are attracted to men,Freund K, Nagler E, Langevin R, Zajac A, Steiner B (1974). Measuring feminine gender identity in homosexual males. Archives of Sexual Behavior, Volume 3, Number 3 / May, 1974, pp. 249-260.Person ES, Ovesey L (1974). The Psychodynamics of Male Transsexualism. In Friedman RC, Richart RM, and Vande Wiele LR (eds.) Sex Differences in Behavior, pp. 315-331. John Wiley & Sons, though occasionally they use it to describe trans men who are attracted to women. The concept of a taxonomy based on transsexual sexuality was first proposed by physician Magnus Hirschfeld in 1922,Hirschfeld M (1922). \\"Sexualpathologie\\", German and codified by endocrinologist Harry Benjamin in the Benjamin Scale in 1966,Benjamin H (1966). The Transsexual Phenomenon. The Julian Press ASIN: B0007HXA76 The Transsexual Phenomenon Chapter 2 table 1 which was published in the influential book The Transsexual Phenomenon. Benjamin wrote that researchers of his day thought that attraction to men while feeling that oneself is a woman was the factor that distinguished a transvestite from a transsexual. He wrote, \\"The transvestite - they say - is a man, feels himself to be one, is heterosexual, and merely wants to dress as a woman. The transsexual feels himself to be a woman (\\"trapped in a man‚Äôs body\\") and is attracted to men.\\" Homosexuality was removed as a mental disorder from the DSM-II, the diagnostic manual published by the American Psychiatric Association, the most widely used diagnostic manual worldwide. Ego-dystonic homosexuality was retained as a diagnosis for those who are caused distress by their sexual orientation. In 1980 in the DSM-III, a new diagnosis was introduced, that of \\"302.5 Transsexualism\\" under \\"Other Psychosexual Disorders\\". This was an attempt to provide a diagnostic category for gender identity disorders; the others included were \\"302.3 Transvestism\\" and \\"302.8 Fetishism\\". The diagnostic category, \\"transsexualism\\", was for gender dysphoric individuals who demonstrated at least two years of continuous interest in transforming their physical and social gender status. The subtypes were 1. asexual, 2. homosexual (same anatomic sex), 3. heterosexual (other anatomic sex) and 0. unspecified. Physician and sexologist Kurt Freund proposed two types of cross-gender identity in 1982, based on his observation that gender identity disorder is different for homosexual males and heterosexual males. Subsequently, this term appeared in the DSM-III-R, but not in the DSM-IV in which gender identity disorder replaced transsexualism. Sexologists may quantitatively measure sexual orientation using psychological personality tests or self reports. Blanchard and Freund used the Masculine Identity in Females (MGI), and the Modified Androphilia Scale. Homosexual transsexuals averaged a Kinsey scale measurement of 5‚Äì6 or a 9.86 ¬± 2.37 on the Modified Androphilia Scale. Terminological debate The concept that transsexuals with homosexual and non-homosexual sexual orientations are etiologically different has a long history in this field. However the terms used have not always been agreed on. Some scientists working on the topic have criticized the practice of categorizing transsexuals by sexual orientation and sex at birth.Diamond M (2006). Biased-Interaction theory of psychosexual development: \\"how does one know if one is male or female?\\" Sex Roles In the words of Benjamin, male-to- female transsexuals can only be homosexual if anatomy alone is considered, and the psyche of MTF transsexuals is ignored. According to him, after SRS, calling a male-to-female transsexual \\"homosexual\\" is pedantic. He opined that the question \\"is a transsexual homosexual?\\" had both \\"yes\\" and \\"no\\" answers depending on whether sexual anatomy or gender identity was prioritised, and in cases of post-operative male-to-female transsexuals, describing them as \\"homosexual men\\" was against \\"reason and common sense\\". When Benjamin was writing, transsexual implied male-to-female, and attracted to men. For a time in the 1980s terms which SJ Wahng describes as homosexual transsexual were in the DSM-III-R (transsexual, homosexual subtype) (see pages 273-274, 282) The DSM-IV and DSM-IV-TR stipulated that the sex a transsexual is attracted to be specified as \\"attracted to males, females, both or neither\\". Others, such as biologist and linguist Bruce Bagemihl, agree with what Benjamin wrote about the use of this term. Bagemihl wrote that this terminology makes it easy to say transsexuals are really homosexual males seeking to escape from stigma.Bagemihl B. Surrogate phonology and transsexual faggotry: A linguistic analogy for uncoupling sexual orientation from gender identity. In Queerly Phrased: Language, Gender, and Sexuality. Anna Livia, Kira Hall (eds.) pp. 380 ff. Oxford University Press Sexologist Jim Weinrich opined that sexologist Ray Blanchard looked for information to support his theory instead of letting the evidence guide his theorizing, by using \\"a series of clever questionnaires and plethysmographic studies.\\"Mass L (1990). ‚Äò‚ÄôDialogues of the Sexual Revolution.‚Äô‚Äô Haworth Press, p. 122 Weinrich said that Blanchard asserted all female-to-male transsexuals were \\"woman loving\\". Leavitt and Berger criticized the term in 1990, saying that it was \\"both confusing and controversial among males seeking sex reassignment.\\"Morgan AJ Jr (1978). Psychotherapy for transsexual candidates screened out of surgery. Archives of Sexual Behavior. 7: 273-282. Critics argue that the term \\"homosexual transsexual\\" is \\"heterosexist\\", \\"archaic\\",Wahng SJ (2004).

Principles and Practice of Sex Therapy, Third Edition. ,Guilford Press of New York, c2000. Benjamin, Leavitt, and Berger have all used the term in their own work. Sexologist John Bancroft also expressed regret for having used this terminology, which was standard when he used it, to refer to transsexual women. He says that he now tries to choose his words more sensitively. Alternative terms Professor of anatomy and reproductive biology Milton Diamond proposed the use of the terms androphilic and gynephilic as alternatives to homosexual and heterosexual. Diamond wrote that the terms homosexual and heterosexual are confusing as applied to transsexual persons because it is not instantly clear whether they reference the pre- or post-transition state.Diamond M, Karlen A (1980). Sexual Decisions. Little, Brown, S.J. Wahng said in 2004 that the diagnosis homosexual transsexual is archaic and conflates homosexuality with transsexuality. Sexological research has been done using these alternative terms by researchers such as Sandra L. Johnson.Johnson SL, Hunt DD (1990). The relationship of male transsexual typology to psychosocial adjustment. Archives of Sexual Behavior, Volume 19, Number 4 / August, 1990 349-360. Both Blanchard and Leavitt used a psychological test called the \\"modified androphilia scale\\" to assess whether a transsexual was homosexual or not. Transgender community reaction According to Leavitt and Berger, \\"transsexuals, as a group, vehemently oppose the label and its pejorative baggage.\\"Leavitt, Frank; Berger, Jack C. (October), \\"Clinical patterns among male transsexual candidates with erotic interest in males\\", Archives of Sexual Behavior 19 (5): 491-505, doi:10.1007/BF02442350, 1573-2800 Trans woman Andrea James has called the term \\"inaccurate and offensive,\\"James A (2006). A defining moment in our history: Examining disease models of gender identity. Gender Medicine. 3:56 and trans man Aaron Devor wrote, \\"If what we really mean to say is attracted to males, then say 'attracted to males' or androphilic... I see absolutely no reason to continue with language that people find offensive when there is perfectly serviceable, in fact better, language that is not offensive.\\" ==Description== Androphilic male-to-female transsexuals Sexual activity Building on work by Freund, Frank Leavitt and Jack C. Berger in 1990 further categorized homosexual transsexuals by three patterns of sexual activity in how they used their penis. In their study 44% were sexually inactive, 19% avoided use of the penis during sex, and 37% derived pleasure from using the penis during sex. The groups showed varying levels of masculinity and emotional disturbance in development. Leavitt and Berger found that transsexuals in the avoidant group are different from those in the other two groups. They fit the description of the \\"nuclear transsexual\\". They had a strong cross gender identification, wanted female anatomy, had never married and little to no sexual activity with females. Of all the subgroups this group had the least comorbid psychopathology. The transsexuals in the pleasure group behaved sexually in ways that were \\"classically homosexual\\". They were more likely than those in the avoidant group to have had sexual experience with females. They also rated higher on a test of general fetishism. Other than this, transsexuals in the pleasure group were similar to the description of a \\"nuclear transsexual\\". They found that transsexuals in the inactive group had characteristics which most differed from that of the \\"nuclear transsexual\\", such as strong heterosexual orientations (as determined from psychological testing), and fetish histories. \\"The pattern exhibited generally conforms to that exhibited by heterosexual transsexuals.\\" The inactive group was found to share little with the other groups of transsexuals other than a stated sexual interest in males. Leavitt and Berger also mentioned studies by Blanchard which suggest that heterosexual transsexuals will adjust their life stories to ensure that they get sex reassignment surgery. Harry Benjamin writes that \\"Other transsexuals find prostitution a useful profession for emotional as well as practical reasons\\". Benjamin goes on to say, \\"How much more can his femininity be reaffirmed than by again and again attracting normal, heterosexual, and unsuspecting men and even being paid for rendering sex service as a woman?\\" Socioeconomic factors Researchers have recently found several demographic features that homosexual transsexuals tend to have in common. Ken Zucker in 2002 and Yolanda Smith et al. in 2005 independently found that homosexual transsexuals were lower in IQ, social class, and age than non-homosexual transsexuals. They were, on average, in their mid-teens to mid-20s when they reported to a gender clinic for sex reassignment. The homosexual transsexuals are more likely to have recent immigrant status, nonintact families, non-Caucasian race, and childhood behavior problems. D.F. MacFarlane studied transsexuals in Australia and New Zealand. MacFarlane found that in New Zealand that 90% of the homosexual transsexual prostitutes were MƒÅori, an ethnic group who are only 9% of the overall population. MacFarlane concluded that culture influenced the number of MƒÅori homosexual transsexuals he observed. Fraternal birth order effect Recent research on the causes of homosexual transsexualism, transsexualism, and homosexuality overlap to a large degree. The etiology of transsexualism concerns the causes of transsexuality in general, including the theory that transsexualism is caused by differences in specific areas of the brain, while relationships between biology and sexual orientation have been studied in depth as possible causes of homosexuality. Blanchard and Zucker came to the general conclusion that birth order has some influence over sexual orientation in biological males in general, and homosexual male-to-female transsexuals in specific. This phenomenon is called the \\"fraternal birth order effect\\". In 2000 Richard Green wrote, \\"Homosexual male-to-female transsexuals have a later than expected birth order and more older brothers than other subgroups of male-to-female transsexuals. Each older brother increases the odds that a male transsexual is homosexual by 40%.\\" Green did not find a higher incidence of homosexuality in the younger brothers of homosexual transsexuals. Zucker and Blanchard wrote that studies have consistently supported the \\"fraternal birth order effect\\" that homosexual transsexuals have more brothers than sisters and are born later in birth order. In contrast, in their study using an Asian sample they found that the transsexual men had significantly more sisters than controls. Zucker attributes this to the preference for males in Korean society causing parents to stop having children once they have a boy. Therefore, all male children are less likely to have older brothers and hence no fraternal birth order effect is observed. Use in Blanchard's typology Sexologist Ray Blanchard defined this category in his research, based on testing or self- report, and argued based on his research that self-report is not always reliable. Morgan, Blanchard, Lawrence, and other researchers have argued that many \\"non-homosexual\\" transsexuals systematically distort their life stories because \\"non-homosexuals\\" were often screened out as candidates for surgery, and because some see \\"homosexual transsexual\\" as a more socially desirable diagnosis. According to Blanchard, key characteristics include conspicuous cross-gender behavior from childhood through adulthood, and a \\"homosexual\\" sexual orientation. Blanchard also says that non-homosexual transsexual women (as well as all other non-homosexual male gender dysphorics) have a condition called autogynephilia and are aroused by the idea or image of themselves as women. Blanchard found in his studies that homosexual transsexuals were younger when applying for sex reassignment, reported a stronger cross-gender identity in childhood, had a more convincing cross-gender appearance, and functioned psychologically better than \\"non-homosexual\\" transsexuals.Blanchard R, Clemmensen LH, Steiner BW (1987). Heterosexual and homosexual gender dysphoria. Archives of Sexual Behavior, Volume 16, Number 2 / April, 1987 A lower percentage of the homosexual transsexuals reported being (or having been) married, as well as sexual arousal while cross-dressing. Studies have variously found that between 10% and 36% of homosexual transsexuals report a history of sexual arousal to cross dressing. Bentler found 23%, while Freund reported 31%. Previous taxonomies, or systems of categorization, used the terms \\"classic transsexual\\" or \\"true transsexual,\\" terms once used in differential diagnoses. Blanchard also said homosexual transsexuals were comparatively shorter and lighter in proportion to their height than non- homosexuals. Independent research done by Johnson and Smith concurs with most of Blanchard's observations. Smith did not find a significant difference in height-weight ratio. Subsequent research has found only partial support of Smith's findings. Johnson's 1990 work used the alternative term \\"androphilic transsexual\\", Johnson wrote that there was a correlation between social adjustment to the new gender role and androphilia. Gynephilic female-to- male transsexuals In 2000, Meredith L. Chivers and Bailey wrote, \\"Transsexualism in genetic females has previously been thought to occur predominantly in homosexual (gynephilic) women.\\" According to them, Blanchard reported in 1987 that only one in 72 female-to-male transsexuals he saw at his clinic were primarily attracted to men. They write that these individuals were so uncommon that some researchers thought that androphilic female-to-male transsexuals did not exist or misdiagnosed them as homosexual transsexuals, attracted to women. Relatively few studies have examined childhood gender variance in biological females. In the 2005 study by Smith and van Goozen, their findings in regards to female-to-male transsexuals were different from their findings for male-to-female transsexuals. Smith and van Goozen's study included 52 female-to-male transsexuals, who were categorized as either homosexual or non-homosexual. Smith concluded that female-to-male transsexuals, regardless of sexual orientation, reported more GID symptoms in childhood, and a stronger sense of gender dysphoria. Smith wrote that she found some differences between homosexual and non-homosexual female-to-male transsexuals. Smith says that non-homosexual female-to-males reported more gender dysphoria than any group in her study. Smith says, \\"It is of interest, though, that a few female-to-male transsexuals reported to have been sexually aroused in adolescence when dressing in male clothes, as this has never been reported before.\\" ==MRI studies and neurological differences== The concept that androphilic male-to-female transsexualism is related to homosexuality in masculine homosexual males has been tested by MRI studies. These studies have been interpreted as supporting Blanchard's transsexualism typology. These studies show neurological differences between homosexual transsexuals and controls as well as differences between homosexual and non-homosexual transsexuals. A 2013 study looked at the brains of homosexual aspiring- transsexual males and females who reported to a gender clinic who had also not had any hormonal treatments. The question the research wished to address was the existence of any differences between transsexual and non-transsexual brains. Their stated reason for selecting homosexual transsexuals was to avoid clouding the issue with a sample of mixed sexual orientations, given Blanchard's typology. This study also controlled for possible influence of external hormones by looking at subjects who had not taken any yet. The study found the following in its sample of homosexual transsexuals: > We found that transsexual subjects did not differ significantly from > controls sharing their gender identity but were different from those sharing > their biological gender in their regional GM volume of several brain areas, > including the left and right precentral gyri, the left postcentral gyrus > (including the somatosensory cortex and the primary motor cortex), the left > posterior cingulate, precueneus and calcarinus, the right cuneus, the right > fusiform, lingual, middle and inferior occipital, and inferior temporal > gyri. Additionally, we also found areas in the cerebellum and in the left > angular gyrus and left inferior parietal lobule that showed significant > structural difference between transgender subjects and controls, independent > from their biological gender. ==See also== * Gynephilia and androphilia * Transgender youth ==ReferencesFurther reading== * ==External links== * TransKids.us - Writings by Self- Identified \\"Homosexual Transsexuals\\" * \\"Autogynephilia and the Taxonomy of Gender Identity Disorders in Biological Males\\" - Ray Blanchard, PhD 2000 Category:Homosexuality Category:Transgender sexuality Category:Transgender studies ","title":"Homosexual transsexual"},{"id":"5599692","text":"is a Japanese musician and fashion model best known as the lead vocalist for new wave band Plastics who then went on to form Melon with Plastics bandmate Toshio Nakanishi.

Russell was drafted by the White Sox as a pitcher in 1912. In his rookie season, his won-loss record was 22‚Äì16 and he led the league in games pitched, with 52. The lefty had a sterling 1.90 ERA while leading the team in innings pitched (316) and wins. Only Washington's ace Walter Johnson topped Reb's eight shutouts, and Russell tied a record that still stands with five 1‚Äì0 victories in a season. In 1916, he was Chicago's opening day starter; that year he led the team in wins (18), innings (264), and shutouts (5), and led the league in fewest walks allowed per inning. Russell helped the White Sox win the 1917 American League pennant, with a won-loss record of 15‚Äì5 and an ERA of 1.95. He was the starting pitcher of Game 5 of the 1917 World Series, but was unable to retire a batter and was replaced in the first inning by Eddie Cicotte. Russell developed arm trouble in 1918 and, after a poor start, was released by Chicago. However, in the minor leagues the decent- hitting Russell converted to playing the outfield and returned to the majors in 1922, playing with the Pittsburgh Pirates. That year, he batted .368 with 12 home runs and 75 RBI in 60 games. On being released at the end of the 1923 season he returned to the minor league American Association (the highest level of minor league play in his era). Russell remained a highly paid star in the AA through age 40, and won the league batting title (.385) when he was 38 years old. ==External links and references== * Biography at SABR's Baseball Biography Project * Category:1889 births Category:1973 deaths Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:Chicago White Sox players Category:Pittsburgh Pirates players Category:Fort Worth Panthers players Category:Minneapolis Millers (baseball) players Category:Columbus Senators players Category:Indianapolis Indians players Category:Quincy Indians players Category:Mobile Bears players Category:Chattanooga Lookouts players Category:Baseball players from Mississippi Category:Sportspeople from Jackson, Mississippi ","title":"Reb Russell"},{"id":"5599729","text":"Yelena Nikolayevna Grosheva (; born April 12, 1979) is a Russian former competitive gymnast.

In 1992, she was sent to Round Lake to train as part of the national team. Her first big competition was the 1994 Junior European Championships and later the same year she went to the World Championships. At the 1994 Goodwill Games she had a stellar competition and one of the high points of her career, being a pivotal part of the Russian gold medal winning team, and winning bronze behind Dina Kochetkova and Shannon Miller, and ahead of such stars as Lilia Podkopayeva in the women's All Around. In 1996, Grosheva finished second all- around in the Russian Cup and became a member of the Olympic team. At the Olympic Games in Atlanta, the Russian team was in the lead after the compulsories, but in the finals she and her teammates had to compete against the noise from the American crowds and finished second behind the Americans. She placed into vault event finals, but finished a disappointing 7th. Her floor exercise scores had placed her highest among the Russians for event finals, but she was replaced by teammate Dina Kochetkova. Overall score was 32.057.  Post-competitive career  After being hampered by injuries Grosheva retired from the sport and joined Cirque du Soleil.

It is situated on the river Regen, 4 km north of Regensburg. ==References== Category:Regensburg (district) ","title":"Lappersdorf"},{"id":"5599789","text":"Stapled hemorrhoidopexy, is a surgical procedure that involves the removal of abnormally enlarged hemorrhoidal tissue, followed by the repositioning of the remaining hemorrhoidal tissue back to its normal anatomic position. Severe cases of hemorrhoidal prolapse will normally require surgery. Newer surgical procedures include stapled transanal rectal resection (STARR) and procedure for prolapse and hemorrhoids (PPH). Both STARR and PPH are contraindicated in persons with either enterocele or anismus. ==Background== Hemorrhoids are amongst the most common anal disorders. Patients may complain of bleeding, prolapse, personal discomfort and minor anal leakage. Where traditional non- surgical measures such as rest, suppositories and dietary advice fail to improve the condition, there is then a choice of further treatments. Opinion on the best management for patients varies considerably. While many treatments for hemorrhoids may be performed without anesthetics, the lasting effect of these conservative therapies has been questioned. Many patients treated with rubber band ligation or injection sclerotherapy require multiple treatments and there is high recurrence rate following these procedures. Conventional hemorrhoidectomy provides permanent symptomatic relief for most patients, and effectively treats any external component of the hemorrhoids. However, the wounds created by the surgery are usually associated with considerable post- operative pain which necessitates a prolonged recovery period. This can put a stress on a general practitioner‚Äôs resources, may alienate the patient and delays the patient's return to a full, normal lifestyle and the workplace. Because of this, surgeons will generally reserve formal excision for the most severe cases of prolapse, or for patients who have failed to respond to conventional treatments. ==Stapled transanal rectal resection (STARR)== Obstructed defecation syndrome (ODS) can be caused by structural deformities in the rectum resulting in chronic constipation. STARR can treat ODS using minimally invasive methods. STARR is a surgical procedure that is performed through the anus, requires no external incisions, and leaves no visible scars. Using a surgical stapler, the procedure removes the excess tissue in the rectum, reducing the anatomical defects that can cause ODS. In a study of 90 patients undergoing the STARR procedure, patients were hospitalized one to three days, experienced minimal postoperative pain after the procedure, and resumed employment or normal activity in 6 to 15 days. In this study, most ODS patients experienced a significant improvement in their ODS symptoms following STARR. ==Procedure for Prolapse and Hemorrhoids (PPH)== PPH uses a circular stapler to reduce the degree of prolapse. The procedure avoids the need for wounds in the sensitive perianal area thus reducing post-operative pain considerably, and facilitates a speedier return to normal activities.Racalbuto, A. et al. Hemorrhoidal stapled prolapsectomy vs. Milligan-Morgan hemorrhoidectomy: a long-term randomized trial. International Journal of Colorectal Disease, 2004; 19: 239-244Rowsell, M., Bello, M., Hemmingway, D.M. Circumfrential mucosectomy (stapled hemorrhoidectomy) vs. conventional haemorrhoidectomy: randomised controlled trial. The Lancet, 4 March 2004; 355: 779-781Boccasanta, P. et al. RCT between stapled circumferential mucosectomy and conventional circular hemorrhoidectomy on advanced hemorrhoids with external mucosal prolapse. American Journal of Surgery, 2001; 182(1): 64-68 Development This procedure was first described by an Italian surgeon ‚Äì Dr. Antonio Longo, Department of Surgery, University of Palermo ‚Äì in 1993 and since then has been widely adopted through Europe. This procedure avoids the need for wounds in the sensitive perianal area and, as a result, has the advantage of significantly reducing the patient's post operative pain. Follow-up on relief of symptoms indicate a similar success rate to that achieved by conventional haemorrhoidectomy.Ganio, E., Altomare, D.F., Gabrielli F., et al. Prospective randomised multicentre trial comparing stapled with open haemorrhoidectomy. British Journal of Surgery, 2001; 88: 669-674 Since PPH was first introduced it has been the subject of numerous clinical trials and in 2003 the National Institute of Clinical Evidence (NICE) in the UK issued full guidance on the procedure stating it was safe and efficacious. Indications PPH is generally indicated for the more severe cases of internal hemorrhoidal prolapse (3rd and 4th degree) where surgery would normally be indicated. It may also be indicated for patients with minor degree haemorrhoids who have failed to respond to conservative treatments. The procedure may be contra-indicated when only one cushion is prolapsed or in severe cases of fibrotic piles which cannot be physically repositioned. In addition to correcting the symptoms associated with the prolapse, problems with bleeding from the piles are also resolved by this excision. Although the cushions may be totally or partially preserved, the blood supply is interrupted or venous drainage is improved by the repositioning. Any external component which remains will usually regress over a period of 3‚Äì6 months. Prominent skin tags may, on occasion, be removed during the operation but this may increase the postoperative pain so is not routinely performed. Procedure PPH employs a unique circular stapler which reduces the degree of prolapse by excising a circumferential strip of mucosa from the proximal anal canal. This has the effect of pulling the hemorrhoidal cushions back up into their normal anatomical position. Usually, the patient will be under general anesthetic, but only for 20‚Äì30 minutes. Many cases have been successfully performed under local or regional anesthesia and the procedure is suited to day case treatment. Post operative course Due to the low level of post-operative pain and reduced analgesic use, patients will usually be discharged either the same day or on the day following surgery. Most patients can resume normal activities after a few days when they should be fit for work. The first bowel motion is usually on day two and should not cause any great discomfort. Staples may be passed from time to time during defecation. This is normal and should not be a cause for concern. Post-operative complications Since 2002 more than 100 articles have been published reporting complications during and after stapled hemorrhoidectomy. Short-term complications Bleeding is the most common postoperative complication. Severe postoperative pain could be caused by dehiscence of the anastomosis or due to the fact that the anastomosis is too near to the linea dentata. A rare complication stemming from PPH is intra-abdominal bleeding. Long-term complications Many long-term complications have been described. Most of them are related to either an incorrect indication for surgery or technical errors. Several authors stated that although it seems to be an easy operation to perform, it should only be done by experienced surgeons. Severe complications leading to death have been described but are rare. Irreversible urge incontinence due to lesions of the sphincter muscle or a diminished rectal capacity due to resection of too much mucosa, are quite common complications if the procedure is not performed properly. Rectovaginal fistulas and anastomotic diverticula are very rare but possible. ==References== Category:Digestive system surgery Category:Colorectal surgery ","title":"Stapled hemorrhoidopexy"},{"id":"5599791","text":"The National Center for Reason and Justice is a United States national non- profit organization disseminating information to the public about claims of injustice in the current criminal justice system and facilitating financial and legal assistance for people the organization considers likely to have been falsely accused or wrongfully convicted.

Produced by Frank Wilson and written by Leonard Caston - a.k.a. Leonard Caston, Jr. - and Kathy Wakefield, \\"Nathan Jones\\" was one of eight Top 40 hits the Supremes recorded after its original frontwoman, Diana Ross, left the group for a solo career. ==Overview== The song centers around a woman's longing for her former lover, a man named Nathan Jones, who left her nearly a year ago \\"to ease [his] mind.\\" Suffering through the long separation (\\"Winter's past, spring, and fall\\") without any contact or communication between herself and Jones, the narrator is no longer in love with Jones, remarking that \\"Nathan Jones/you've been gone too long\\". ==Supremes version== \\"Nathan Jones\\" is an unusual entry among the Supremes' singles repertoire for several reasons, not the least of which is the fact that all three members of the group (Jean Terrell, Mary Wilson, and Cindy Birdsong) sing the song's lead vocal in unison. Clydie King was asked to sing along with the group to give the song a fuller vocal sound. While working on the song, producer Frank Wilson had in mind a rock music style of phrasing for the song, resulting in the unison vocals. The unison vocals would repeatedly be dubbed to create a layered harmonic tone. In addition, Wilson had his engineer, Cal Harris, use what can (now) be considered classic studio sensibilities to take The Funk Brothers' backing tracks for \\"Nathan Jones\\" and give them a phase shifting sound at various points during the song. This was accomplished by either using a second recorder (as the Beatles would have done) or (less likely) an outboard processor such as the blue faced MXR flanger. Released as a single on April 15, 1971 with \\"Happy is a Bumpy Road\\" as the B-side, \\"Nathan Jones\\" peaked at number sixteen on the Billboard Pop Singles chart, number-eight on the Billboard R&B; chart. Overseas, the single went to number five on the UK Singles Chart. \\"Nathan Jones\\" was the most successful single released from the Supremes' fourteenth regular studio album, Touch.

There are three distinct versions of Bananarama's rendition of the song. 1\\\\. Bass Tone Version. They first recorded it on their 1987 album Wow! with their original line-up. This version was also featured on the Rain Man soundtrack. Some of the vocals were sampled on their \\"I Heard a Rumour\\" B-side song \\"Clean Cut Boy\\". This version also appears on the US Greatest Hits album, with a timing of 3:02. An extended version appears here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqfs6WQikYM 2\\\\. Psycho Mix. After Siobhan Fahey was replaced by Jacquie O'Sullivan, Bananarama re- recorded the song (with completely new vocal and instrumental arrangements). This new version was initially included on vinyl and cassette issues of their Greatest Hits Collection. It was then remixed and released as a single, peaking at number fifteen on the UK singles chart. This version is considered the 'official' version of the song, and is the version used for the group's BRIT-award-nominated music video. It has a running time of 3:19.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJH33L6Xs90 3\\\\. Dave Ford Mix. A third version of the single, while similar to the Psycho Mix, opens with a staccato synthesizer instead of the single-note of the Psycho Mix, and includes more prominent synthesizer throughout. It uses the vocals from the Psycho Mix, although brought more to the front of the instrumentation. This mix appears on the Canadian version of the Greatest Hits album, and is the version which most closely resembles how it is heard when Bananarama plays live. (This mix is alternatively known as the ‚ÄúAnalogue‚Äù mix, as it was never issued on CD until the ‚ÄúMegarama‚Äù compilation in 2015). This version has a running time of 3:30. There is currently available a remix on social media which samples all three versions, with the Dave Ford version beginning at the 10:35 mark.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q_97S1Xzjw All three versions have 12\\" remixes available (multiple remixes in the case of 1. and 2.) Music video The music video, directed by Andy Morahan, featured the girls performing the song with vogue-style choreography with four male dancers dressed in British-style suits, hats, and umbrellas. Their performance is interspersed with shots of them strutting down a fashion catwalk in three different outfits, reflecting the three different seasons mentioned in the song (winter, spring, fall/autumn), and performing the main choreography in yet a fourth change of wardrobe. Sara and Keren are seen sharing the same black-with-copper-coloured-leaves jacket throughout.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOFbFgeLtr0 Individual shots of the girls are accompanied by floating images of fruits and art objects, such as vases and statues. The video was nominated for best music video at the BRIT Awards, but lost to Michael Jackson's \\"Smooth Criminal\\". Performances The group performed the song on several popular shows of the day, including Top of the Pops, The Great Big British Pop Machine, at the 1988 Royal Variety Performance in the presence of The Queen Mother and, famously, on the Terry Wogan show, in which Keren is seen doing the first verse choreography during the second verse.

The matches have top-class status and are the highest T20 standard. The game is played under the rules of Twenty20 cricket. Starting from the format's inception in 2005, T20I status only applied to Full Members and some Associate Member teams. However, in April 2018, the ICC announced that it would grant T20I status to all its 105 members from 1 January 2019. The shortened format was initially introduced to bolster crowds for the domestic game, and was not intended to be played internationally, but the first Twenty20 International took place on 17 February 2005 when Australia defeated New Zealand, and the first tournament was played two years later, with the introduction of the ICC T20 World Cup. In 2016, for the first time in a calendar year, more Twenty20 International matches (100) were played than ODI matches (99). As of 3 May 2019, 80 nations feature in ICC T20I team rankings. Twenty20 International format also sees one mandatory powerplay taken in the first six overs. This shorter format of the game makes reaching the traditional milestones of scoring a century or taking five wickets in an innings more difficult, and few players have achieved these. The highest individual score in a Twenty20 International is 172, made by Australia's Aaron Finch against Zimbabwe in 2018, while India's Deepak Chahar has the best bowling figures of 6/7 against Bangladesh in November 2019. ==Origins== Cricket itself was probably first played in England in the Late Middle Ages, but it did not rise to prominence until the eighteenth century. A set of laws were drawn up in 1744, and the game achieved a level of relative standardisation by the late nineteenth century. One-day cricket was trialled in 1962, and the first domestic tournament played the following year, and in 1971, England and Australia contested the first One Day International. The match consisted of one innings for each side, with 40 eight-ball overs. In the 1990s, a number of countries were exploring the possibility of a shorter game still: in New Zealand, Martin Crowe developed Cricket Max, in which each team bats for 10 eight-ball overs, while in Australia they considered an eight-a- side contest they dubbed \\"Super 8s\\". At the same time, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) conducted consumer research, and proposed the idea of a 20 overs-per-side contest, which would last for about three hours. The first match was played in 2003 between Hampshire and Sussex. ==History== The first Twenty20 International match between two men's sides was played on 17 February 2005, involving Australia and New Zealand. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack reported that \\"neither side took the game especially seriously\\", and it was noted by ESPNcricinfo that but for a large score for Ricky Ponting, \\"the concept would have shuddered\\". However, Ponting himself said \\"if it does become an international game then I'm sure the novelty won't be there all the time\\". Two further matches were played that year; England beat Australia in June, and South Africa were defeated by New Zealand in October. Early the following year, a contest between New Zealand and the West Indies finished as the first tied match, and a tiebreak was played for the first time in men's international cricket: the two sides took part in a bowl-out to determine a winner; New Zealand won 3‚Äì0. The game had initially been developed to boost the interest in domestic cricket, and to aid this the international teams were only allowed to host three T20Is each year. The cricket manager for the ICC, David Richardson, also commented that \\"Part of the success of Twenty20 cricket is making sure it can coexist with Test cricket and one-dayers.\\" Despite this, the first international tournament was held in 2007 in South Africa; the 2007 ICC World Twenty20. That tournament was won by India, who defeated their close rivals Pakistan in the final. Writing for The Guardian, Dilip Premachandran suggested that the competition's success meant that \\"the format is here to stay\\". The next tournament was scheduled for 2009, and it was decided that they would take place biannually (more frequently than the 50 over Cricket World Cup, which occurs once every four years). In the opening match of the 2007 World Twenty20, Chris Gayle scored the first century in a T20I, the achievement being reached in the twentieth match of the format. The 500th T20I match was contested between Ireland and the United Arab Emirates at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium, Abu Dhabi on 16 February 2016. ICC decided to use Umpire Decision Review System (DRS) in Twenty20 Internationals from the end of September 2017, with its first use in the India-Australia T20I series in October 2017. ==Current international rankings== thumb300x300pxCurrent ICC members by membership status: Full members (12) Associate members with ODI status (8) Associate members (85) Former members (4) Non-members ==Teams with T20I status== Permanent T20I status Prior to 2019, permanent T20I status was limited to the Test-playing nations (the full members of the ICC), which included 12 teams after the promotion of Afghanistan and Ireland to full member status in 2017. In April 2018, the ICC announced that it would grant T20I status to all of its 105 members from 1 January 2019. Nations that have played T20I cricket are listed below, with the date of their first T20I after gaining permanent T20I status shown in brackets (some of these nations had previously played T20Is with Temporary status): # (17 February 2005) # (17 February 2005) # (13 June 2005) # (21 October 2005) # (16 February 2006) # (15 June 2006) # (28 August 2006) # (28 November 2006) # (28 November 2006) # (1 December 2006) # (5 February 2018) # (12 June 2018) # (20 January 2019) # (20 January 2019) # (20 January 2019) # (20 January 2019) # (21 January 2019) # (31 January 2019) # (31 January 2019) # (13 February 2019) # (13 February 2019) # (13 February 2019) # (15 March 2019) # (22 March 2019) # (22 March 2019) # (22 March 2019) # (29 March 2019) # (29 March 2019) # (25 April 2019) # (25 April 2019) # (25 April 2019) # (25 April 2019) # (11 May 2019) # (11 May 2019) # (20 May 2019) # (20 May 2019) # (20 May 2019) # (20 May 2019) # (20 May 2019) # (20 May 2019) # (25 May 2019) # (31 May 2019) # (31 May 2019) # (15 June 2019) # (16 June 2019) # (24 June 2019) # (24 June 2019) # (8 July 2019) # (13 July 2019) # (22 July 2019) # (18 August 2019) # (18 August 2019) # (18 August 2019) # (29 August 2019) # (29 August 2019) # (29 August 2019) # (29 August 2019) # (30 August 2019) # (3 October 2019) # (3 October 2019) # (3 October 2019) # (3 October 2019) # (5 October 2019) # (14 October 2019) # (14 October 2019) # (15 October 2019) # (25 October 2019) # (26 October 2019) # (6 November 2019) # (6 November 2019) # (5 December 2019) # (23 February 2020) # (21 August 2020) Temporary T20I status Between 2005 and 2018, the ICC granted temporary ODI and T20I status to a selection of other teams (known as Associate members). Teams earned this temporary status for a period of four years based on their performance in the quadrennial ICC World Cricket League ‚Äì or, more specifically, based on the top six finishing positions at the ICC World Cup Qualifier, which is the final event of the World Cricket League. Teams could also earn this status by qualifying for the ICC T20 World Cup. Twelve nations held this temporary T20I status before being promoted to T20I status or relegated after underperforming at the World Cup Qualifier or World Twenty20 Qualifier: * (from 1 September 2007, until 30 January 2014) * (from 12 September 2007, until 20 June 2018) * (from 2 August 2008, until 12 March 2017) * (from 2 August 2008, until 29 July 2018) * (from 2 August 2008, until 28 January 2014) * (from 3 August 2008, until 8 April 2009) * (from 1 February 2010, until 5 June 2017) * (from 16 March 2014, until 29 July 2018) * (from 16 March 2014, until 18 January 2017) * (from 17 March 2014, until 22 October 2018) * (from 13 July 2015, until 17 March 2018) * (from 25 July 2015, until 19 January 2017) The ICC has also given special T20I status to the ICC World XI team for: *The 2017 Independence Cup, a three match series versus Pakistan national team to help revive international cricket in Pakistan. *The Hurricane Relief T20 Challenge, a one-off match against West Indies on 31 May 2018, to raise funds for stadiums damaged by Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Maria in September 2017. ==Cricket at international multi-sport events== Ajantha Mendis was the first player to take six wickets in a T20I Cricket was played as part of the 1900 Summer Olympics, when England and France contested a two-day match. In 1998, cricket was played as part of the Commonwealth Games, on this occasion in the 50-over format. There was some talk about Twenty20 cricket being part of the 2010 Commonwealth Games, which were held in Delhi, but at the time the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), were not in favour of the short format of the game, and it was not included. Cricket was played in 2010 Asian Games in Guangzhou, China and 2014 Asian Games in Incheon, South Korea. India skipped both times. There was further calls for subsequent Commonwealth Games and Olympic Games. The Commonwealth Games Federation asked the ICC to participate in the 2014 and 2018 Commonwealth Games, but the ICC turned down the invitation. In 2010, the International Olympic Committee recognised the International Cricket Council as a governing body that complied to the requirements of the Olympic charter which in turn meant that cricket could apply to be included in the Olympic Games, but in 2013 the ICC announced that it had no intentions to make such an application, primarily due to opposition from the BCCI. ESPNcricinfo suggested that the opposition might be based on the possible loss of income. In April 2016, ICC chief executive David Richardson said that Twenty20 cricket can have a chance of getting in for the 2024 Summer Games, but there must be collective support shown by the ICC's membership base, in particular from BCCI, in order for there to be a chance of inclusion. ==Statistics== The highest team total in a T20I was made by Afghanistan versus Ireland when they scored 278/3. The lowest total was recorded in 2019, when Czech Republic bowled out the Turkey for just 21 runs. The highest successful chase was made in February 2018, when Australia scored 245 runs to overhaul New Zealand's target and win the match. Virat Kohli has scored the most runs in the format with 2,794. Aaron Finch has made the highest individual score in T20Is, with his innings of 172 against Zimbabwe in 2018. Sri Lankan bowler Lasith Malinga holds the records for the most wickets, having taken 107 wickets in 84 matches, whilst India's Deepak Chahar recorded the best bowling figures when he took 6 wickets for 7 runs against Bangladesh in November 2019. ==See also== * List of International Cricket Council members * Women's Twenty20 International ==References== * * ","title":"Twenty20 International"},{"id":"5599850","text":"Hannah Apps is the former vice-mayor and mayor of Kalamazoo, Michigan.

Accessed 2009-06-13. Lumen gentium, 8 (english) Accessed 2011-10-25. the fundamental document on the church from the Second Vatican Council of the Catholic Church. Since the Council the reason for use of the term \\"subsists in\\" rather than simply ‚Äúis‚Äù has been disputed. Generally, those who see little or no change in church teaching in Vatican II insist on the equivalence of subsistit in and ‚Äúis‚Äù. Those who point to a new, ecumenical thrust in Vatican II insist that the term was introduced as a compromise after much discussion, and acknowledges new elements in the Council's teaching. The context of the statement is: This is a debate about externals, the institutional integrity of a church, the fullness of the means of salvation. \\"There is no question of denying that a non-Catholic community, perhaps lacking much in the order of means, can achieve a higher degree of communion in the life of Christ in faith, hope and love than many a Catholic community.\\" ==Development of doctrine==  The issue  The correct meaning of \\"subsists in\\" has important implications for how the Catholic Church views itself and its relations with other Christian communities and other religions. Questions have been raisedPeter Hebblethwaite, Pope Paul VI,Paulist Press 1993 about whether Lumen gentium altered the longstanding phrase according to which the Church of Christ is (Latin est) the Catholic Church. Lumen gentium does recognize that other Christian ecclesial communities have elements of sanctification and of truth. And the Council used the traditional term \\"Church\\" to refer to the Eastern Churches not in full communion with the Catholic Church. \\"These Churches,\\" it said, \\"although separated from us, yet possess true sacraments and above all, by apostolic succession, the priesthood and the Eucharist, whereby they are linked with us in closest intimacy.\\"Unitatis redintegratio, 15. It called them \\"particular or local Churches\\".Unitatis redintegratio, 14; and these particular or local Churches are referred to as \\"Sister Churches\\".Ut unum sint, 56.  Development  After the 16th century Reformation, Catholic theology identified the Church of Christ with the Catholic Church. This continued through the teaching of popes Pius XI and Pius XII. At the Second Vatican Council, the preparatory draft for the Decree on the Church contained this long-held understanding, following Pius XII in identifying the Mystical Body of Christ with the Catholic Church. The American ecclesiologist Joseph A. Komonchak chronicles the breakdown of this long-held understanding at the Council. The Council's Doctrinal Commission explained the change in the final draft of Lumen gentium from \\"is\\" to \\"subsists in\\", \\"so that the expression may better accord with the affirmation about ecclesial elements which are present elsewhere.\\" Komonchak points out that since \\"some wanted to strengthen the statement, others to weaken it\\" the Doctrinal Commission decided to stay with the change of verb. He suggests that following \\"the first rule of conciliar hermeneutics\\" we should examine statements of Vatican II about these \\"ecclesial elements\\" found outside the Catholic Church. He mentions that the same document, Lumen gentium, preferred to speak of those \\"fully incorporated\\" into the church and avoided the term \\"membership\\".Lumen gentium, 14. It mentioned that \\"several elements of sanctification and of truth are found outside its visible structure.\\"Lumen gentium, 8. Elements mentioned as a part of the church's visible structure that are \\"present elsewhere\\" include the Spirit of Christ, the means of salvation, the profession of faith, and sacraments.Lumen gentium, 14. This is reinforced in the decree on ecumenism (Unitatis redintegratio) which says: \\"Very many, of the most significant elements and endowments that together go to build up and to give life to the Church itself can exist outside the visible boundaries of the Catholic Church: the written Word of God, the life of grace, faith, hope, and charity, with other interior gifts of the Holy Spirit, as well as visible elements ... (and) not a few of the sacred actions of the Christian religion.\\"Unitatis redintegratio, 3 The decree then says that only the Catholic Church has the \\"fullness of the means of salvation\\". Cardinal Walter Kasper has pointed out that, as to this claim that the fullness of the Church of Christ resides in the Catholic Church, this \\"does not refer to subjective holiness but to the sacramental and institutional means of salvation, the sacraments and the ministries.\\" == Ongoing dispute == Progressives and traditionalists have continued to argue their point on whether \\"subsists in\\" means \\"is\\": did Vatican II say that the Catholic church is the only church (as external society) that Jesus founded? Some point to Paul VI's statement that seems to favor the identity of the two terms.\\"There is no better comment to make than to say that this promulgation really changes nothing of the traditional doctrine. What Christ willed, we also will. What was, still is. What the Church has taught down through the centuries, we also teach.\\" (Speech at the promulgation of the Constitution on the Church and the Decrees on the Eastern Churches and Ecumenism) In response, others point out that many ‚Äúbecame increasingly alarmed at relatively early signs of regression beginning in the pontificate of Paul VI.\\" This regression is further noted in the near disappearance, in the Extraordinary Synod of 1985, of the term \\"The People of God\\", another key concept of the Council.  Sebastian Tromp as author  Sebastian Tromp, a Dutch Jesuit, a Scholastic theologian and close to Pope Pius XII, is considered to have been the main though unacknowledged author of Mystici corporis Christi. As advisor to Cardinal Alfredo Ottaviani during Vatican II, Tromp was also, according to existing tape recordings and diaries, the father of \\"subsistit\\", which to his understanding of Latin did not mean anything new but indicated completeness.Alexandra von Teuffenbach Die Bedeutung des subsistit in (LG8). Zum Selbstverst√§ndnis der katholischen Kirche, Herbert Utz Verlag, M√ºnchen 2002 and Alexandra von Teuffenbach Konzilstagebuch Sebastian Tromp SJ mit Erl√§uterungen and Akten aus der Arbeit der Theologischen Kommission, 2006, Editrice Pontificia Universit√† Gregoriana Also claiming credit for this phrase in Lumen gentium is Wilhelm Schmidt, then Pastor of the Protestant Church of the Holy Cross at Bremen-Horn, who states that \\"At the time I was pastor ... and during the third and fourth sessions, an observer at the Council as the representative of the Evangelical Fraternity Michael, at Cardinal Bea‚Äôs invitation. I submitted in writing the formulation ‚ÄúSubsistit in‚Äù to the man who was then the theological adviser of Cardinal Frings: Joseph Ratzinger, who relayed it to the Cardinal. (\\"Catechism Of the Crisis In the Church, Pt. 6, Angelus Online) Some regard this as unlikely, since Protestant observers did not have any direct and active role in the proceedings. Wilhelm Schmidt is not mentioned in Bea's diary nor does his name come up in the relevant sections of the authoritative autobiography of Cardinal Augustin Bea by St. Schmidt, the autobiographies of Joseph Ratzinger, Karl Rahner, K√ºng or in any other historical treatease of Vatican II. However it is quite possible that such an observer could have privately and informally suggested to a Council Father or periti some turn of phrase which the Father or periti might find useful, and which the periti or Father might pass along to the Council. But Francis A. Sullivan pointed out: When in 2007 a statement from the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith called into question the contemporary consensus on the import of the use of \\"subsistit\\", some identified inconsistencies in the Congregation's own statement, and pointed out that this goes against four decades of teaching by such eminent theologians as Christopher Butler, Yves Congar, George Tavard, Joseph A. Komonchak, and Francis A. Sullivan.  Response to traditionalists  Traditional Catholic groups consider Lumen gentium one of several demarcations of when the post-conciliar Church has issued problematic statements, pointing to the use of \\"subsistit in\\" rather than \\"est\\" as an abdication of the Church's historic (and to them compulsory) identification of itself alone as God's church.Talk by Fr. Franz Schmidberger, First Assistant to the Superior General of the SSPX (February 22, 2001). In an interview with Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, then-Cardinal Ratzinger (later elected Pope Benedict XVI) responded to this criticism as follows: :The concept expressed by \\"is\\" (to be) is far broader than that expressed by \\"to subsist\\". \\"To subsist\\" is a very precise way of being, that is, to be as a subject, which exists in itself. Thus the Council Fathers meant to say that the being of the Church as such is a broader entity than the Roman Catholic Church, but within the latter it acquires, in an incomparable way, the character of a true and proper subject.\\"ANSWERS TO MAIN OBJECTIONS AGAINST DOMINUS IESUS\\" by then-Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (now Pope Benedict XVI) == References  Further reading == * Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith: Declaration Dominus Iesus on the unicity and salvific universality of Jesus Christ and the Church *An Examination of Subsistit in: A Profound Theological Perspective, by Fr.

After Northern Wei's Emperor Daowu seized most of Later Yan territory in 397, he commissioned Gao Tao as an official, but Gao Tao soon died. Gao Yun took the caskets of his grandfather Gao Tai (È´òÊ≥∞) and his father Gao Tao back to Bohai Commandery and, after giving his inheritance to his two younger brothers, briefly became a Buddhist monk with the name Fajing (Ê≥ïÊ∑®), but soon thereafter gave up the monastical lifestyle. He studied astronomy and astrology, as well as the Spring and Autumn Annals. He served as a commandery official as well. In 430, when he was already 40, Gao Yun served on the staff of Emperor Taiwu's uncle Dugu Hunchao (Áç®Â≠§Ê∏æË∂Ö) the Prince of Yangping, and he became known for his honesty in judging criminal matters. In 431, he was summoned to the capital Pingcheng (Âπ≥Âüé, in modern Datong, Shanxi), and he then served successively on the staffs of Emperor Taiwu's brothers Tuoba Fan (ÊãìÊãîÁØÑ) the Prince of Le'an and Tuoba Pi (ÊãìÊãî‰∏ï) the Prince of Leping. It was after assisting Tuoba Pi in a campaign that he was created the Baron of Wenyang. Around 440, the powerful prime minister Cui Hao added Gao to his staff, as he began to compile a history of the Northern Wei state. It was also around this time that he had a debate about astrology with Cui, and while Cui, himself an astrology scholar, initially disagreed with Gao's opinions, he eventually came to accept Gao's opinions. What Cui did not accept Gao's opinions on was how Cui was approaching his relationship with Emperor Taiwu's crown prince Tuoba Huang, as Cui, against Crown Prince Huang's opinion, was recommending a large number of people to be commandery governors, over those that Crown Prince Huang believed should be promoted. When Gao heard this, he stated, \\"It will be difficult for Cui Hao to avoid disaster. How will he be able to afford to oppose those more powerful than he, just to satisfy his own desires?\\" Further, In 450, at the suggestion of his staff members Min Dan (ÈñîÊπõ) and Chi Biao (ÈÉóÊ®ô), Cui carved the text of the histories that he was the lead editor of onto stone tablets, and erected the tablets next to the altars to Heaven outside of Pingcheng. The tablets were said to have revealed much about Emperor Taiwu's ancestors, and the Xianbei were very angry, accusing Cui of revealing the ancestors' faults and damaging the image of the state. Emperor Taiwu, in anger, arrested Cui. Meanwhile, Crown Prince Huang, wanting to spare Gao, brought him into the palace, and asked Gao to blame all of the writing on Cui. Gao, instead, ascribed the authorship of the various parts of histories as such: * The biography of Emperor Daowu was written by Deng Yuan. * The biographies of Emperor Mingyuan and Emperor Taiwu were written jointly by Cui and Gao, but Gao said that he actually wrote about two thirds. Emperor Taiwu was initially going to put Gao to death as well, but then was said to be impressed by Gao's admission and spared him, also at Crown Prince Huang's urging. He then summoned Cui, and Cui was said to be so fearful that he was not able to respond. Emperor Taiwu then ordered Gao to draft an edict for him, ordering that Cui and Cui's staff‚Äî128 men in total‚Äîbe executed, along with five family branches each. Gao refused‚Äîstating that not even Cui should be executed. Emperor Taiwu, in anger, was going to put Gao to death as well, but Crown Prince Huang again pleaded for Gao, and Gao was again spared, and in fact, Emperor Taiwu reduced the number of people to be executed. However, Emperor Taiwu still ordered a great slaughter of people related to Cui. Cui's staff members themselves were executed, although not their families. After Cui's death, Gao continued to serve in the imperial administration, and he appeared to serve on Crown Prince Huang's staff. Crown Prince Huang was described to be high observant, but trusting of his associates and also spending much effort on managing orchards and farms, to earn money from them. Gao Yun tried to advise him against engaging in commercial ventures and in overly delegating authorities, but he did not listen. Rather, in 451, he became embroiled in a conflict with the eunuch Zong Ai, whose corruption he had found out and whom he disliked immensely. Zong, apprehensive that Crown Prince Huang's trusted associates Chouni Daosheng (‰ªáÂ∞ºÈÅìÁõõ) and Ren Pingcheng (‰ªªÂπ≥Âüé) would accuse him of crimes, acted preemptively and accused Chouni and Ren of crimes. In anger, Emperor Taiwu executed Chouni and Ren, and many other associates of Crown Prince Huang were entangled in the case and executed as well. In fear, Crown Prince Huang became ill and died. Gao became greatly saddened, and when he met with Emperor Taiwu, he could say nothing but wept. In 452, after Emperor Taiwu began to regret the events leading to Crown Prince Huang's death, Zong became apprehensive and assassinated Emperor Taiwu, making Emperor Taiwu's youngest son Tuoba Yu the Prince of Nan'an emperor. Later that year, however, he assassinated Tuoba Yu as well, and then was overthrown and killed by the officials Dugu Ni (Áç®Â≠§Â∞º), Yuan He, Baba Kehou (ÊãîÊãîÊ∏¥‰æØ), and Buliugu Li, who made Tuoba Huang's son Tuoba Jun emperor (as Emperor Wencheng). It was said that Gao was involved in their plot as well, but unlike the others, his role was hidden and he went unrewarded, and he did not reveal his role during his lifetime, either. ==Service under Emperor Wencheng== During Emperor Wencheng's reign, Gao Yun appeared to gradually gain power, and one characteristic that Emperor Wencheng stated that he appreciated Gao for was that he often counseled Emperor Wencheng‚Äîsometimes harshly‚Äîin private, and Emperor Wencheng said that by counseling in private, he avoided embarrassing the emperor while giving the emperor good advice. In 458, after successfully persuading Emperor Wencheng to stop palace construction projects that Emperor Wencheng's attendant Guo Shanming (ÈÉ≠ÂñÑÊòé) had encouraged the emperor to carry out, Gao was promoted to the high-level position of Zhongshuling (‰∏≠Êõ∏‰ª§), and after Buliugu Li alerted Emperor Wencheng to the fact that Gao's household was poor (because at the time, the Northern Wei officials were not given salaries, and Gao, unlike most other Northern Wei officials, was not corrupt), gave Gao a large stipend. Further, honoring Gao's position as a senior official, Emperor Wencheng referred to him as \\"Lord Ling\\" (‰ª§ÂÖ¨, where Ling was shortened from Zhongshuling) rather than by name. ==Service under Emperor Xianwen== After Emperor Wencheng's death in 465, his son Emperor Xianwen became emperor, but the power was controlled by the dictatorial official Yifu Hun, who killed a large number of other officials. In 466, Emperor Wencheng's wife Empress Dowager Feng staged a coup and overthrew Yifu, taking over herself as regent. She engaged Gao Yun, along with Gao L√º (È´òÈñ≠) and Jia Xiu (Ë≥àÁßÄ) to be part of her decision-making circle. Later that year, based on the proposal of Gao Yun and Li Xin (ÊùéË®¢), schools began to be set up at the commandery level to promote learning. Emperor Xianwen assumed full imperial powers in 467, at the age of 13. Gao continued to be in an honored position, and in 471, when Emperor Xianwen considered yielding the throne to his uncle Tuoba Zitui (ÊãìÊãîÂ≠êÊé®) the Prince of Jingzhao, Gao was one of the officials whose opinions he consulted, and contrary to the other officials, who used harsh words in opposing the idea and instead proposing the idea of Emperor Xianwen yielding the throne to his son and crown prince Tuoba Hong, Gao spoke in more philosophical terms: :I dare not speak more, but I bless Your Imperial Majesty in this way: consider the important responsibilities that the ancestors gave you, and also consider the precedence of the Duke of Zhou assisting the young King Cheng of Zhou. Emperor Xianwen took this to be a suggestion to pass the throne to his son as well, and accepted it. The four-year-old Crown Prince Hong became emperor (as Emperor Xiaowen), although Emperor Xianwen continued to be control of the government as Taishang Huang (retired emperor). ==Service under Emperor Xiaowen== After Emperor Xiaowen took the throne, Gao Yun resumed the work on Northern Wei's history that Cui Hao had started, although he did not expend his full effort on the matter. He later recommended Gao L√º to succeed him in the matter. Meanwhile, for his contributions, he was created the Duke of Xianyang and made the governor of Huai Province (Êá∑Â∑û, modern northeastern Shanxi and northwestern Hebei). He requested to be retired in 478, but briefly he was recalled back to the capital Pingcheng, where he was given the special privilege of being allowed to ride a wagon into the palace and not having to bow to the emperor due to his old age. As of 479, he was said to be still of clear mind and was involved in a major reorganization of the laws. Because Emperor Xiaowen felt that Gao was poor materially and had little entertainment, he sent the imperial musicians to Gao's house every five days to entertain him, and supplied Gao with food and clothing. Whenever Gao would meet with the emperor, the emperor also prepared a cane and a small table to help him. Gao was said to have been healthy throughout his life, and in 487, after a very brief illness, he died. It was said that the imperial awards given at his death were unprecedented.

It was the third and final LP under the supervision of Frank Wilson, who had been the group's main producer since 1970, when Jean Terrell joined as lead singer. The album also marked the first Motown contributions by composer-producer Leonard Caston, Jr. and writer- lyricist Kathleen Wakefield: \\"Nathan Jones\\", a hit single sung by all three members, which was later recorded by Bananarama, and \\"Love It Came to Me This Time\\". The album included contributions by several Motown artists and staff writers: \\"Here Comes the Sunrise\\" by actor-composer Clifton Davis (who had written \\"Never Can Say Goodbye\\" for The Jackson 5); Billy Page's \\"Johnny Raven\\" (recorded by Kiki Dee in her 1970 Motown album), and \\"Have I Lost You\\" by Pam Sawyer and Gloria Jones. Wilson also recorded Jean Terrell's vocals to the backing track of a cover of Laura Nyro's \\"Time and Love\\" that Bones Howe had produced for Diana Ross, but that was shelved and remained unreleased until 2002. The other tracks were written by Sawyer and Wilson, including the opening and closing numbers, \\"This Is the Story\\" and \\"It's So Hard for Me to Say Goodbye\\"; \\"Happy (Is a Bumpy Road)\\", released as flip side of \\"Nathan Jones\\"; and the album title track, \\"Touch\\", the first charting Supremes single to feature lead vocals by both Terrell and founding member Mary Wilson. The song missed the US top 40, peaking at #71, and it was later recorded by The Jackson 5. After this release, producer Frank Wilson went on to work with Motown artist Eddie Kendricks. This album also contained liner notes written by Elton John, and sold over 100,000 copies in the USA. ==Track listing== All lead vocals by Jean Terrell except where noted. ==Personnel== *Jean Terrell ‚Äì lead and background vocals *Mary Wilson ‚Äì lead and background vocals *Cindy Birdsong ‚Äì background vocals *The Blackberries ‚Äì background vocals *Frank Wilson ‚Äì producer ==Charts== { !Chart !Peak position - U.S. Billboard 200 align=\\"center\\"85 - U.S. Billboard R&B; Albums Chart align=\\"center\\"4 - UK Albums Chart align=\\"center\\"40 } ==References== Category:The Supremes albums Category:1971 albums Category:Motown albums Category:Albums produced by Frank Wilson (musician) ","title":"Touch (The Supremes album)"},{"id":"5599899","text":"The 2006‚Äì07 Heineken Cup was the 12th edition of the European Heineken Cup rugby union club tournament. The pool draw took place on 21 June at Twickenham. The pool stages started on 20 October and concluded in January, going for six rounds. Following the quarter- and semi-finals, the final was played on 20 May before a near-capacity crowd at the 82,000-seat redeveloped Twickenham in London. London Wasps defeated Leicester Tigers 25‚Äì9, denying Tigers the domestic and European treble. ==Draw== The top seeds from each of the participant nations (France, England, Scotland, Italy, Wales and Ireland) were all drawn into separate pools. These top seeds were; Benetton Treviso (pool 1), Edinburgh (pool 2), Sale Sharks (pool 3), Cardiff Blues (pool 4), Ulster (pool 5) and Biarritz (pool 6). Rules state that no two sides from the same country could be allocated the same pool. However, the seventh French club Castres could be drawn into any pool. The draw took place on 21 June. The greatest team representation is from France, which has seven teams participating in the tournament. England has the second largest representation with six teams. Ireland, Wales and Italy all have three teams, and Scotland have two. ==Competition format== Border Reivers against Biarritz Olympique at Parc des Sports d'Aguilera in Biarritz, France. In the pool matches, teams receive: * four points for a win * two points for a draw * a bonus point for scoring four or more tries, regardless of the match result * a bonus point for losing by seven or fewer points Ties between two teams are broken in the following order: # Competition points earned in head-to-head matches. For example, if tied teams are in the same pool, and split their head-to-head matches, but one team earned a bonus point and the other failed to do so, the team that earned the bonus point will win. # Tries scored in head-to-head matches. # Point difference in head-to-head matches. # Tries scored in all pool matches. This is the first tiebreaker between teams in different pools, which can come into play for determining seeding among first-place teams (and did in 2006‚Äì07), or breaking ties among second-place teams. # Point difference in all pool matches. # Best disciplinary record in pool play. The team with the fewest players sent off or sin-binned during pool play wins. # Coin toss. The quarterfinals are seeded from 1 to 8. The six pool winners receive the top six seeds, based on their point totals. The top two second-place finishers are seeded 7 and 8. The seeds of the qualifying teams are in parentheses next to their names in the tables. ==Pool stage== Full results can be found at 2006‚Äì07 Heineken Cup pool stage.

Jim√©nez, Jr. (July 30, 1940 - June 13, 2006) was an American sculptor of Mexican descent. He was born in El Paso, Texas, and died in New Mexico. He studied art and architecture at the University of Texas in Austin and El Paso, earning a bachelor's degree in 1964. He moved to New York City in 1966 after completing his post-graduate work at Ciudad Universitaria, Mexico City, D.F. He became an accomplished artist and taught art at the University of Arizona and later the University of Houston. ==Career== For over 30 years, Jim√©nez produced a consistent body of work informed by his highly developed craft skills, knowledge of art history and his own placement in time. Jim√©nez was known for his large polychromed fiberglass sculptures usually of Southwestern and Hispanic themes. His works were often controversial and eminently recognizable because of their themes and the bright, colorful undulating surfaces that Jim√©nez employed. John Yau observes that one of the underlying reasons his public sculptures have been controversial is because he keeps bringing into view that which has been overlooked; he keeps reminding us that our history is made up of many points of view, many tales and tellings. A reexamination of the context and purpose of public sculpture and the making (writing) and remaking (rewriting) of the untold tales and popular myths about the formation of the continually changing American West. Jim√©nez was influenced by the murals of Jos√© Clemente Orozco and Diego Rivera. He was very much a contemporary artist whose roots are in pop art, as much as they are in both the modernism of the Mexican muralists and the regionalism of Benton and Grant Wood. Heroic sculptures were Jim√©nez's forte, but his art is intended for the people. Proud of his Chicano heritage and working-class background, he champions the common man in his work. Working in his father's shop, making neon signs, as well as lowrider car culture, and featuring brightly painted fiberglass bodywork were also artistic influences.Questions and Answers about Luis Jimenez' Southwestern Pieta - Hispanic Research Center, Arizona State University, 2001 He unapologetically finds his images in stereotypes and magnifies those stereotypes into a kind of celebration. What makes Jimenez‚Äôs sculpture come alive, what makes it sculptural, and also gives life to Olmec heads, Aztec serpents, and the statues of Rodin, and the totems of David Smith, is movement. In 1993, Jim√©nez was a recipient of the New Mexico Governor's Awards for Excellence in the Arts. In 1998 he received a Distinguished Alumni award from the University of Texas in recognition of his artwork. Jim√©nez's eldest daughter lives in New York, where she creates fashions designs. His daughter Elisa is a multimedia artist and fashion designer and was a contestant on Season 4 of Bravo's reality television series Project Runway. ==Works== * Assyrian Lion, Kalamazoo Institute of Arts, Kalamazoo, 2004 * Man on Fire, Smithsonian American Art Museum, Washington DC, 1969 * Progress I, Albuquerque Museum, New Mexico, 1974albuquerquemuseum.org * Vaquero, Moody Park, Houston, Texas, 1980 * Sodbuster, Wichita State university as part of the Ulrich Museum of art outdoor sculpture collection, 1980‚Äì81 *Honky Tonk, Wichita State University as part of the Ulrich Museum, 1981 * Southwest Pieta, Longfellow Park, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 1983 (declared a national treasure by President Bill Clinton in 1999). * Howl, Albuquerque Museum, New Mexico and Ulrich Museum of Art, Wichita State University, 1986.albuquerquemuseum.org * Border Crossing/Cruzando el Rio Bravo, Santa Fe, New Mexico and Los Angeles, California, 1989. * Steelworker, Birmingham Museum of Art, Birmingham, Alabama, 1990. * Fiesta Jarabe, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM * Cleveland Fallen Firefighters Memorial, Cleveland, OH, 2006. * Blue Mustang, Denver International Airport, Denver, Colorado, * Los Lagartos, Downtown, El Paso, Texas, 1993 ==Death== Jimenez died in an accident at age of 65 in his studio in Hondo, New Mexico on June 13, 2006, when a large section of his 32-foot-high work Blue Mustang, intended for Denver International Airport, fell on him and severed an artery in his leg.

In many jurisdictions, if an individual has accepted possession of goods or property and knew they were stolen, then the individual is typically charged with a misdemeanor or felony, depending on the value of the stolen goods and the good and or property is returned. If the individual did not know the goods were stolen, then the goods are returned to the owner and the individual is not prosecuted. However, there are often exceptions, because of the difficulty of proving or disproving an individual's knowledge that the goods were stolen. ==Nature of offence by country== Canada The Criminal Code specifies three offences: :* Possession of property obtained by crime (s. 354)Criminal Code, s. 354 :* Trafficking in property obtained by crime (ss. 355.2)Criminal Code, ss. 355.1 - 355.4 :* Possession of property obtained by crime for the purposes of trafficking (ss. 355.4) The basic definition for the possession offence (which is almost identical in wording for the trafficking offences) is as follows: Where the value of the property is greater than $5,000, the maximum punishment on indictment is 10 years for possession only, and 14 years if related to trafficking. Otherwise, the maximum on indictment is two years and five years respectively, or alternatively punishment by summary conviction. (ss 355 and 355.5) United Kingdom Handling stolen goods is the name of a statutory offence in England and Wales and Northern Ireland. It takes place after a theft or other dishonest acquisition is completed and may be committed by a fence or other person who helps the thief to realise the value of the stolen goods. It replaces the offence of receiving stolen goods under section 33 of the Larceny Act 1916. England and Wales This offence is created by section 22(1) of the Theft Act 1968 which provides: Stolen goods: This term means property stolen anywhere, as long as the theft amounted to an offence where committed. It includes any proceeds of that property, including money for which it has been sold, and anything bought with those proceeds.by sections 24(2)(a) and (b) However, property which has been returned to the original owner, or otherwise lawful custody, is no longer regarded as stolen, by section 24(3). This may create difficulties, as in Haughton v. Smith. It is not necessary that the property be \\"stolen\\" in a limited sense; section 24(4) of the Act specifically extends the scope to property obtained by fraud or blackmail. However, it is also implicit in the definition of offences such as burglary or robbery that handling may apply to the proceeds of these offences. Dealing: The offence of handling is drafted widely enough to criminalise any dishonest dealing with property which has been come by dishonestly; for example, the original thief may also be convicted of a subsequent handling if he later arranges its sale. A codification of the methods of dealing has been suggested as #receiving stolen goods, #arranging to receive them, #undertaking the keeping, removing, disposing of or realisation of stolen goods by or for the benefit of another person, or helping with any of those things, or #arranging to do any of the things in (3). This makes the actus reus of handling very wide; for example, in R v Kanwar,[1982] 2 All E R 528, CA 161 a man had brought stolen goods into the marital home, and his wife, the defendant, had lied to the police; it was held that this constituted \\"assisting in the retention\\" of those goods. Knowledge or belief: The accused's knowledge or belief as to the nature of the goods is crucial, but has been a constant source of interpretive problems. Either may be based on what the thief says or some other positive information, but belief is less than knowledge and more than mere suspicion. In R v Hall [1985] 81 Cr App R 260, it was held that, per Boreham, J., He went on to distinguish the case where a defendant has said The situation is further complicated by the concept of recklessness or wilful blindness to the circumstances; either will be treated as a belief that the goods are stolen. Thus, suspicion will be converted into belief when the facts are so obvious that belief may safely be imputed. So if the defendant bought goods in a pub or a dark alley for a fraction of their true value and it is clear that identification marks or serial numbers have been erased, any denial of belief by the defendant would not be credible. Dishonestly: The mens rea of the offence is the same as for theft (see Ivey v Genting Casinos 2017 UKSC 67.). There was at one time an issue of impossibility in that the defendant may be dishonest and intend to handle goods (which he believes to be stolen) but which are not in fact stolen. The House of Lords ruled in Haughton v. Smith (1973) that where goods previously stolen have been reduced into lawful possession, not only can they not be handled, but there can be no attempt to handle them. Since then, section 1 of the Criminal Attempts Act 1981 confirms that such a defendant can be convicted. Laundering is now an offence under ss.327/9 and 340(3)(b) Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 and the distinction with handling depends on whether the defendant's intention was to launder the proceeds of crime or merely to assist a thief. Laundering covers large amounts of money in a series of transactions over time when the defendant knows or suspects that the assets which he has concealed, acquired, used, possessed, or in respect of which he has entered into an arrangement which he knows or suspects facilitates the acquisition, retention, use or control of criminal property by or on behalf of another person, are the proceeds of criminal conduct (compare money laundering). Section 23Section 23 Theft Act 1968 of the 1968 Act creates an offence of \\"advertising rewards for the return of stolen goods\\". This prohibits public advertising for the return of such goods stating that \\"no questions will be asked\\", or offering immunity from prosecution to the returner, or stating that any monies paid for the goods will be reimbursed. This is a summary offence but is rarely prosecuted. Handling stolen goods is triable either way.The Magistrates' Courts Act 1980, section 17(1) and Schedule 1, paragraph 28 A person guilty of handling stolen goods is liable, on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding fourteen years,The Theft Act 1968, section 22(2) or on summary conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or to a fine not exceeding the prescribed sum, or to both.The Magistrates' Courts Act 1980, section 32(1) The wording of Section 22 actually creates eighteen ways in which handling may be committed, This may create a problem for prosecutors in that Rule 7 of the Criminal Procedure Rules 2005, and Rule 7 of the Indictments Rules 1971 provide that only a single offence may be charged in one information (in the Magistrates' Court) or in one count of an indictment (in the Crown Court). It can also be difficult to determine the meaning of \\"otherwise than in the course of stealing\\"; it was decided in R v Hale [1979] 1 Crim LR 596 that the \\"appropriation\\" in theft may be a continuing act, so it may be difficult to determine whether a theft has been completed. Apart from the apparent difficulties of specifying a charge that does not offend against the rule against duplicity, it has been said that \\"in practice almost anything a person does with stolen goods may be classified as a handling\\". Section 27(3) of the Theft Act 1968 introduces a rare exception to the rule against admissibility of previous criminal conduct in the case of this offence. Evidence may be adduced (but only if handling is the only charge faced by the defendant) that the defendant (a) has been involved in similar conduct within the previous twelve months AND (b) has a previous conviction for handling within five years. This is to counter repeated defences of \\"innocent dealing\\" as may be put forward by dishonest pawnbrokers. If the defendant is facing other charges, evidence of previous bad character may be admissible under Section 98 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. Northern Ireland This offence is created by section 21(1) of the Theft Act (Northern Ireland) 1969. Scotland In Scotland, this crime is called reset. It includes property that was taken by theft or robbery as well as property taken by breaches of trust including embezzlement, fraud and willful imposition.Lying to the police about the location of known stolen goods has been sufficient to be prosecuted for reset, as it aids the criminal in retaining the goods. Republic of Ireland The offence of handling stolen property is created by section 17(1) of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act, 2001. United States In the United States, Receipt of stolen property is a federal crime under , defined as knowingly receiving, concealing, or disposing of stolen property with a value of at least $5,000 that also constitutes interstate commerce (i.e., has been transported across state lines). A person can be found guilty of that offense only if all of the following facts are proven: * The person received or concealed or stored or disposed of items of stolen property. * The items were moving as, or constituted a part of, interstate commerce. * The items had a value in excess of $5,000. * The person acted knowingly and willfully. The government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the person either received, concealed, stored, sold, or disposed of the stolen property. To be guilty of the offense, a person must know that the property had been stolen, but he need not know that it was moving as, or constituted a part of, interstate commerce. The term \\"interstate commerce\\" merely refers to the movement of property from one U.S. state into another; and it is sufficient if the property has recently moved interstate as a result of a transaction or a series of related transactions that have not been fully completed or consummated at the time of the person's acts as alleged. All US states also have laws regarding receipt of stolen property; however, there usually is no minimum dollar amount in many jurisdictions, and, of course, the requirement in Federal law regarding interstate commerce does not apply. Also, in many states (Ohio, for example), the burden to prove criminal intent is not as stringent or is nonexistent. This means that one can be charged with the crime - usually a minor degree of felony - even if the person did not know the item in question was stolen. In the Ohio case of State v. Awad, the goods did not need to actually be stolen, just represented as such. Receiving stolen property and possession of stolen property are treated as separate offenses in some jurisdictions. The distinguishing element is when the person knew that the property was stolen. If the person knew that the property was stolen at the time he received it, the crime is receiving stolen property. If the person did not know the property was stolen at the time she received it but found out after receiving possession, the crime is possession of stolen property. The state must prove that the defendant received or possessed the property for a dishonest purpose. If, for example, the person acquired possession for the purpose of returning the property to its lawful owner, no crime has been committed. ==See also== * Fence (criminal) * Handling salmon in suspicious circumstances * Sting operation ==References== Category:Theft Category:Crimes Category:Property crimes Recel Ricettazione pt:Recepta√ß√£o ","title":"Possession of stolen goods"},{"id":"5599973","text":"Celia Hart (January 4, 1962 - September 7, 2008) was a Cuban physicist and writer.

It along with its southern neighbor, Ngoyo, and Loango, its neighbor on the north were important political commercial centers during the seventeenth through nineteenth centuries. The people speak a dialect of the Kikongo language and thus may be considered a part of the Bakongo ethnicity. ==Early history== The earliest history of Kakongo is unknown, and oral traditions collected in the region in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries do not do much to elucidate the earliest history of the country.Phillipson, David W. (2005) African Archaeology (3rd edition) Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, England, page 295, In its present state, archaeology can only attest that the region was already in the Iron Age by the fifth century BC, and that complex societies were emerging in the general vicinity by the early centuries CE. The kingdom is first mentioned in the titles of the King of Kongo Afonso I in 1535, in which he notes that he was king over this region, as well as a number of others located along the north bank of the Congo River.Martin, Phyllis M. (1972) The external trade of the Loango Coast, 1576-1870: the effects of changing commercial relations on the Vili Kingdom of Loango Clarendon Press, Oxford, England, page 31, This title has led historians to believe that Kakongo was once part of a federation of states that included Kongo and that may have formed as early as the late fourteenth century. Kakongo was, however, an independent state for all intents and purposes from the sixteenth century onward. Portuguese merchants, interested in the trade in copper, ivory, and slaves began to establish factories in Kakongo in the 1620s and Dutch and English merchants also visited the kingdom during the seventeenth century. Its capital was called Kinguele, and was an inland town. ==Commercial center== Kakongo became a very important commercial center in the eighteenth century, regularly visited by ships from England, France, the Netherlands, and Portugal. Its port of Cabinda was a major hub and lay in a protected bay. Slaves dominated the exports of the country, though most were simply transhipped from areas further south, both in the Kingdom of Kongo and the eastern provinces of Angola (such as Matamba). In 1775, French missionaries sought to convert the kingdom, along with its neighbors, to Christianity, hoping to reap the fruit of its long association with the neighboring, Christian, Kingdom of Kongo. The mission was largely unsuccessful, but did make contact with a community of Christians from Kongo's province of Soyo living at the town of Manguenzo in the interior. The mission was ultimately abandoned, however. ==Notes== Category:Iron Age cultures of Africa Category:Countries in medieval Africa Category:Countries in precolonial Africa Category:History of Central Africa Category:History of the Republic of the Congo Category:Former kingdoms Category:Kingdom of Kongo ","title":"Kakongo"},{"id":"5599994","text":"Lobos de Arecibo () are a professional baseball team in the Puerto Rican Professional Baseball League, based in Arecibo. The Lobos won the 1983 national baseball championship and the 1983 Caribbean World Series, the only time the franchise won both titles. ==History== The franchise first appeared in the 1960-61 season, managed by former major leaguer Luis Rodriguez Olmo. The ‚ÄòLobos‚Äô could not participate in the 1981-82 season, and requested a recess. Their players were allowed to be drafted by the other teams, on the condition that they would be returned to Arecibo if the ‚ÄòLobos‚Äô were to play the following season. The team filed for returning to play the following season (1982‚Äì83), which required a vote from the other team owners. Jose ‚ÄòChiro‚Äô Cangiano, then the owner of the Leones de Ponce, led a movement to block Arecibo from returning, since he would benefit from former Lobos players, such as pitcher Edwin Nu√±ez, who had a stellar season playing with Ponce. On the day of the voting, Cangiano could not arrive to San Juan in time for the meeting. His representative, who had not received instructions on how to vote, voted in favor of Arecibo returning, and thus the Lobos were back on the league. Nu√±ez was later traded to the Leones. That same season, the Lobos defeated the Leones in the final, 4 games to 3, to capture their first title. They also captured the Caribbean Series title in Venezuela. The Lobos won the national baseball championship again in 1996, a team that included New York Yankees outfielder Bernie Williams, and Milwaukee Brewers catcher Mike Matheny; but finished second in the Caribbean Series, which was won in Mexico by the Tomateros de Culiac√°n. The Lobos ceased operation in 1999. ==Return of the Lobos== After six years without the team, Arecibo saw the return of the Lobos in 2005. The team had spent that time in various cities, under names like the San Juan Senators and even one year with the historic moniker of the Cangrejeros de Santurce. But for the 2005-2006 season, the team was acquired by a sports-loving local doctor who, with his fellow townsfolk in mind, returned the team to its rightful place. Facing only 28 days in which to prepare the Luis Rodriguez Olmo stadium for play after six years of neglect, the citizens of Arecibo, together with state and local officials, performed what has been known as the \\"Milagro Lobo\\" or the miracle of the wolf, returning its infrastructure to more than acceptable conditions in such a short period of time. ==Puerto Rico Baseball League== On November 18, 2009, the Lobos defeated the Indios. A scheduled game against the Leones del Escogido was suspended due to rain. On November 29, 2009, the Lobos lost to the √Åguilas Cibae√±as in inter-league action. The following night, the team won their eight game of the season, defeating the Leones del Escogido. In the third game of this inter-league series, the Lobos defeated the Estrellas Orientales. During the trade stage, the team's general manager, Pachy Rodr√≠guez, expressed satisfaction with the acquisition of H√©ctor Pellot from the Criollos in exchange for Adri√°n Ortiz.

He was a medical student in Paris until 1924 when he met Andr√© Breton through Pierre Naville, a Surrealist writer, and childhood friend. In the mid-1920s, Boiffard decided to dedicate himself to research in the Bureau of Surrealist Research, writing the preface with Paul √âluard and Roger Vitrac to the first issue of La R√©volution surr√©aliste. Preferring photography to literature, he served as Man Ray‚Äôs assistant from 1924 to 1929. During the 1920s, he took portraits of the English writer Nancy Cunard and photographs of Paris which Breton used to illustrate his novel Nadja. In 1928, Boiffard was abruptly expelled from the movement for taking photographs of Simone Breton. He co-founded a studio, Studio unis, with photographer Eli Lotar in 1929, although the studio went bankrupt in 1932. From 1929 onward, Boiffard was closely associated with Georges Bataille and the circle of writers involved in Documents, in which his best-known work was published, illustrating articles such as Bataille‚Äôs \\"The Big Toe\\" (1929, issue 6), Robert Desnos‚Äô \\"Pygmalion and the Sphinx\\" (1930, issue 1), and Georges Limbour‚Äôs \\"Eschyle, the carnival and the civilized\\" (1930, issue 2). Boiffard's photographs often manipulate scale and point of view, transpose multiple exposures, and contrast brightly lit objects against darkened backgrounds. He also made several photograms. In 1930, he contributed to Un Cadavre, a pamphlet that attacked Breton. During the political turmoil of the 1930s, Boiffard was a member of the Groupe Octobre led by Jacques Pr√©vert, and he exhibited his work as part of the Association des √âcrivains et Artistes R√©volutionnaires. He accompanied members of the Groupe October to Russia in 1933. Boiffard then set out on a world tour with fellow photographer Eli Lotar. Although partly financed by museologist Georges Henri Rivi√®re and the Vicomte de Noailles the trip came to an early end in Tangiers. Following his return to Paris, Boiffard exhibited photographs from his travel in 1934 at the Galerie de la Pl√©iade. Following his father's death in 1935 Boiffard resumed his studies to earn a doctorate in medicine in 1940 specializing in radiology, once and for all putting an end to his career as a photographer. He served as a radiologist at the H√¥pital Saint-Louis in Paris from 1940 to 1959.

He was Speaker of the Legislative Council from 1939 until his death. ==Biography== Early life Fagan was born at Gaffneys Creek, Victoria, Australia, in 1873, and went to school in Waratah, Tasmania until he was 10. He then worked in various Australian towns as a miner. By the time he came to New Zealand about 1900, he had split from his first wife. In the West Coast mining community he was the \\"voice of thoughtful militancy in the 'Red' federation\\" of Labour. His second marriage was to Monica McKittrick (n√©e Gardiner), a widow with three children whom he married on 10 September 1917 in Christchurch. Political career Fagan as Speaker of the Legislative Council. Fagan was expected by many to stand in the 1918 Grey by-election after the sitting member, Paddy Webb, was jailed for his vocal opposition to conscription, but the Labour Party hierarchy chose Harry Holland from Wellington instead based on the latter's strong showing in the Wellington North by-election a few months prior. Fagan stood in the 1925 general election in the Motueka electorate, but was beaten by the incumbent, Richard Hudson of the Reform Party. In 1928, he moved to Petone in the Hutt Valley and in the following year, he was the organiser for Walter Nash's successful Hutt by-election. Fagan was on Labour's National Executive from 1930. On 11 June 1930 he was appointed to the Legislative Council by the United Government, and at the end of each seven-year term, he was reappointed twice. He was reappointed by the United-Reform Coalition on 11 June 1935, and was reappointed by the First Labour Government on 11 June 1944. He was Speaker from 18 July 1939 until his death. He was a Minister without portfolio in the first Labour Government from 6 December 1935 until 18 July 1939, and was acting Minister of Customs in 1939 when Walter Nash was overseas. In 1935, he was awarded the King George V Silver Jubilee Medal. Death His wife Monica died in 1932, being survived by three daughters from her first marriage. He died in Petone, Wellington on 31 December 1947. The Fagans are buried at Karori Cemetery. ==NotesReferences== * Category:1873 births Category:1947 deaths Category:Australian emigrants to New Zealand Category:Speakers of the New Zealand Legislative Council Category:Members of the Cabinet of New Zealand Category:New Zealand Labour Party MLCs Category:Wellington Harbour Board members Category:Social Democratic Party (New Zealand) politicians Category:Members of the New Zealand Legislative Council Category:Unsuccessful candidates in the 1925 New Zealand general election Category:Burials at Karori Cemetery ","title":"Mark Fagan"},{"id":"5600051","text":"A supercorridor is a proposed new type of transportation infrastructure in the United States. A supercorridor would use swaths of land up to 1,200 feet (370 m) wide to carry parallel links of freeways, rails, and utility lines. The freeway portions would be divided into two separate elements: truck lanes and lanes for passenger vehicles. Similarly, the rail lines in the corridor would be divided among freight, commuter, and high-speed rail. Services expected to be carried in the utility corridor include water, electricity, natural gas and petroleum, plus fiber optic lines and other telecommunications services. Supercorridors bypass traditional national borders, instead using inland ports known as \\"smartports\\". Border guards and customs officers would check the cargo at these inland ports. ==Criticism== Critics of supercorridors complain that existing transportation infrastructure is not being invested in and maintained. Other critics are concerned about the environmental damage which might occur by creating a supercorridor.July 5, 2006 column by Jerome R. Corsi, \\"NASCO Alters Super-Corridor Message\\" Still others are concerned about issues of national and state sovereignty, and the possible increased danger of terrorism, in the rapid transfer of individuals, goods and materials across borders. Acquisition of large swaths of land for such corridors has created questions about property rights and the use of eminent domain. ==See also== *Concesiones de Infraestructuras de Transporte *International Mid-Continent Trade Corridor *North American SuperCorridor Coalition *Trans-Texas Corridor ==ReferencesFurther reading== *Craig Howie US divided by superhighway plan The Scotsman June 16, 2006 ==External links== *North American SuperCorridor Coalition Category:Proposed transportation infrastructure in the United States ","title":"Supercorridor"},{"id":"5600056","text":"The following is a list of the longhorn beetles recorded in Great Britain.

It was later relicensed by Namco as Pac-In-Time, replacing the characters to fit the Pac-Man franchise. ==Plot== A group of Tinies return to their home planet after a voyage in space. They find out that their beautiful home has been turned into a horrid place by The Wicked One, a dark and cunning Tiny with a giant fang jutting from its mouth. The player controls a Tiny, who must defeat The Wicked One, who has captured the king and turned all the Tinies into mindless monsters by using a device simply referred to as \\"the machine\\". ==Gameplay== The player guides a small furry, bouncy and fragile Tiny across eight regions of the land, Desert, Lagoon, Forest, Pyramids, Mountains, Factory, Village, and finally the Castle where one must defeat the Wicked One. The regions each have unique music, color schemes and styles. Each has 10 separate levels and a collection of secret bonus levels. The final stage of the game has the player entering the machine (which turns out to be a large industrial complex) and destroying it. Along the way the player must avoid various perils, such as monsters, spikes and acid. The game's primary unique feature is Tiny's ability to transform itself into four different forms: yellow, green, red and blue. Different skills are required at different points, and not all forms are available in all levels. Particularly in levels which are primarily puzzlers, the player may encounter fields which activate and deactivate certain powers. In its yellow form, it controls the element of fire, allowing it to shoot fireballs. In its red form, it controls the element of earth, allowing it to eat through some elements of the scenery. In its green form, it controls the element of air, allowing it to produce ropes from its hands to swing around the environment and it can also pull different objects with its rope. In its blue form, it controls the element of water, allowing the ability to dive underwater and shooting bubbles that damage hostiles. ==Pac-In-Time== In 1994 Fury of the Furries was licensed to Namco which changed the graphics & music, and released the game as Pac-In-Time as part of the Pac-Man franchise. The DOS and Macintosh versions of the game were mostly identical to the original, but with Pac-Man as the game's protagonist. ==References within the game== One can play the game in the Fremen language. The game contains references to various cultural phenomena, including Shakespeare, Pac-Man, Batman, Cool Spot, Street Fighter II and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Level two of the Pyramid stage references the giant ball trap from the tomb at the start of the Indiana Jones film Raiders of the Lost Ark. Level four of the Pyramid stage is based on the ending to Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, with the three traps inside the temple being recreated in Furry form. Level two of the Forest stage references Star Wars by featuring a wrecked AT-ST in the background. Furry versions of the Big Bad Wolf and \\"Little Red Riding Hood\\" appear in level five of the Village stage, as well as The Three Little Pigs. Level nine of the Village stage includes a white balloon-like enemy that chases the tiny around the level. It is a reference to Rover, the device used to chase would-be escapees in The Village in The Prisoner. In the Village stage you can also see the balcony scene from Romeo & Juliet of Shakespeare. The loading screens include parodies, too. The Desert's shows a Tiny ridding the sandworm from Dune of Frank Herbert, while Pyramid's shows a Tiny in an Indiana Jones outfit. The loading screen of Forest levels shows a Tiny in Tarzan outfit. The image shown during the Lagoon's loading shows a parody of the Jaws poster. On the loading screen of the Factory the Tiny version of the T-1000 shows up. On the Village levels' loading screen, the bicycle from E.T. is visible on the sky. In Mountains level appears purple cow referred to Milka chocolate. Dracula appears in level one of the Castle stage. Level two of the Castle stage, featuring a maze complete with ghosts and hundreds of coins, mimics the Pac-Man series of games. Level five of the Castle stage is based on the Donkey Kong series. One level of the Machine refers to arcade pinball game play field (includes flippers and kickers), while a Tiny is acting as a steel ball, while another features a parody of Space Invaders. This stage also features Batman, one of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Guile, Chun-Li and Blanka from Street Fighter, an Alien and a Lemming from the Psygnosis game Lemmings. The Smurfs appear in the Village stage. ==Reception== Computer Gaming World in April 1994 said that Fury of the Furries \\"sports an awful plot and totally unoriginal gameplay, but it has good graphics and is quite addictive ... unoriginal, bland and safe\\". In 1994, PC Gamer UK named Fury of the Furries the 40th best computer game of all time. The editors called it \\"a must for anyone with a huge arcade appetite.\\" ==ReferencesExternal links== * *Fury of the Furries Original Soundtrack (Amiga version) *Fury of the Furries Original Soundtrack (DOS AdLib version) Category:Mac OS games Category:Amiga games Category:CD32 games Category:DOS games Category:Platform games Category:Puzzle video games Category:Video games developed in France Category:Video games scored by Fr√©d√©ric Motte Category:1993 video games ","title":"Fury of the Furries"},{"id":"5600075","text":"Scott Russell Haskin (born September 19, 1970) is a retired American professional basketball player who was selected by the Indiana Pacers in the first round (14th pick overall) of the 1993 NBA draft.

His parents were Landgrave Louis VI of Hesse-Darmstadt and Elisabeth Dorothea of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg (1640‚Äì1709). Ernest Louis's desire to emulate the French court under Louis XIV ran his country into debt. Among those patronized in this cultural milieu were the Baroque composer Christoph Graupner and the gambist Ernst Christian Hesse; also bringing into his service architect Louis Remy de la Fosse for his extensive building program. Upon his death in 1739, his country's debt was 4 million gulden, ten times the annual revenue. ==Family== Ernest Louis married Dorothea Charlotte of Brandenburg-Ansbach (1661‚Äì1705), daughter of Albert II, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach (1620‚Äì1667) on December 1, 1687.

It grows on the upper parts of beaches and endures salted air. It is one of the most common and most widely distributed salt tolerant plants and provides one of the best known examples of oceanic dispersal. Its seeds float and are unaffected by salt water. Originally described by Linnaeus, it was placed in its current genus by Robert Brown in 1818. ==Description== Ipomoea pes-caprae is a prostrate perennial, often covering large areas; stems long-trailing often several metres in length, rooting at the nodes, glabrous. It has pink petals with a darker centre. ==Distribution== Ipomoea pes-caprae in China This species can be found on the sandy shores of the tropical Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans. A similar species, Ipomoea imperati, with white flowers, has an even wider distribution on the world's beaches. I. pes-caprae is common on the sand dunes of Australia's upper north coast of New South Wales, and can also be found along the entire Queensland coastline. Goat's Foot is a primary sand stabilizer, being one of the first plants to colonise the dune. It grows on almost all parts of the dune but is usually found on the seaward slopes, sending long runners down towards the toe of the dune. The sprawling runners spread out from the woody rootstock, but the large two-lobed leaves are sparse and a dense cover on the sand is rarely achieved except in protected situations. This plant grows in association with sand spinifex grass and is a useful sand binder, thriving under conditions of sand blast and salt spray. Community species: Ipomoea pes-caprae has been observed in community situations, studied for their endurance of difficult growing conditions (on dunes) with some other tough species. * Hydrocotyle bonariensis * Senecio crassiflorus * Juncus acutus Together with Melanthera biflora, Portulaca oleracea and Digitaria ciliaris, Ipomoea pes-caprae is usually one of the first species colonizing degraded or altered environments in tropical zones of the planet.Heatwole, H., Done, T., Cameron, E. Community Ecology of a Coral Cay, A Study of One-Tree Island, Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Series: Monographiae Biologicae, Vol. 43, p. 102 ==Uses== In Australia, it is a commonly used aboriginal medicine used as poultice for sting ray and stone fish stings. In Brazil, this plant - namely the subspecies brasiliensis - is known as salsa-da-praia in folk medicine, and is used to treat inflammation and gastrointestinal disorders. In the Philippines, the plant is known locally as Bagasua and is used to treat rheumatism, colic, oedema, whitlow, and piles. ==Etymology== I. pes-caprae comes from the Latin 'pes' for foot and 'caprae' for goat and refers to the resemblance of the outline of the leaf to the footprint of a goat. ==Gallery== Image:Ipomoea pes-caprae 3.JPGVines on a pebble beach File:Ipomoea pes-caprae Malaysia.jpgBeach morning glory in Malaysia File:Ipomoea pes-caprae DSCN0356 02.JPGBeach morning glory, Muzhappilangad Beach File:Ipomoea pes-caprae DSCN0356 04.JPGBeach morning glory, Muzhappilangad Beach File:Ipomoea pes-caprae subsp. brasiliensis near Potzuliao Harbor, Yunlin.jpgBeach morning glory vines, Yunlin File:View of Eastern ghats over plant bushes at Tenneti Park beach.jpgView of Eastern ghats over beach morning glory bushes, Tenneti Park ==ReferencesExternal links== * * Category:Halophytes pes-caprae Category:Pantropical flora Category:Plants described in 1818 ","title":"Ipomoea pes-caprae"},{"id":"5600123","text":"WOSM (103.1 FM) is a radio station broadcasting a News/Talk format.

Fertigation is related to chemigation, the injection of chemicals into an irrigation system. The two terms are sometimes used interchangeably however chemigation is generally a more controlled and regulated process due to the nature of the chemicals used. Chemigation often involves insecticides herbicides, and fungicides, some of which pose health threat to humans, animals, and the environment. ==Uses== Fertigation is practiced extensively in commercial agriculture and horticulture. Fertigation is also increasingly being used for landscaping as dispenser units become more reliable and easier to use. Fertigation is used to add additional nutrients or to correct nutrient deficiencies detected in plant tissue analysis. It is usually practiced on the high-value crops such as vegetables, turf, fruit trees, and ornamentals. ==Commonly used nutrients== Most plant nutrients can be applied through irrigation systems. Nitrogen is the most commonly used plant nutrient. Naturally occurring nitrogen (N2) is a diatomic molecule which makes up approximately 80% of the earth's atmosphere. Most plants cannot directly consume diatomic nitrogen, therefore nitrogen must be contained as a component of other chemical substances which plants can consume. Commonly, anhydrous ammonia, ammonium nitrate, and urea are used as bioavailable sources of nitrogen. Other nutrients needed by plants include phosphorus and potassium. Like nitrogen, plants require these substances to live but they must be contained in other chemical substances such as monoammonium phosphate or diammonium phosphate to serve as bioavailable nutrients. A common source of potassium is muriate of potash which is chemically potassium chloride. A soil fertility analysis is used to determine which of the more stable nutrients should be used. ==Advantages== The benefits of fertigatio methods over conventional or drop-fertilizing methods include: * Increased nutrient absorption by plants. * Accurate placement of nutrient, where the water goes the nutrient goes as well. * Ability to \\"micro dose\\", feeding the plants just enough so nutrients can be absorbed and are not left to be washed down to storm water next time it rains. * Reduction of fertilizer, chemicals, and water needed. * Reduced leaching of chemicals into the water supply. * Reduced water consumption due to the plant's increased root mass's ability to trap and hold water. * Application of nutrients can be controlled at the precise time and rate necessary. * Minimized risk of the roots contracting soil borne diseases through the contaminated soil. * Reduction of soil erosion issues as the nutrients are pumped through the water drip system. Leaching is decreased often through methods used to employ fertigation. ==Disadvantages== * Concentration of the solution may decrease as the fertilizer dissolves, this depends on equipment selection. If poorly selected may lead to poor nutrient placement. * The water supply for fertigation is to be kept separate from the domestic water supply to avoid contamination. * Possible pressure loss in the main irrigation line. * The process is dependent on the water supply's non-restriction by drought rationing. ==Methods used== * Drip irrigation ‚Äì Less wasteful than sprinklers. It is not only more efficient for fertilizer usage, but can also be for maximizing nutrient uptake in plants like cotton.Hou, Z., Li, P., Li, B. et al. Plant Soil (2007) 290: 115. doi:10.1007/s11104-006-9140-1 Drip irrigation using fertigation can also increase yield and quality of fruit and flowers, especially in subsurface drip systems rather than above surface drip tape.Elhindi, Khalid, El-Hendawy, Salah, Abdel-Salam, Eslam, Elgorban, Abdallah, & Ahmed, Mukhtar. (2016). Impacts of fertigation via surface and subsurface drip irrigation on growth rate, yield and flower quality of Zinnia elegans. Bragantia, 75(1), 96-107. Epub December 22, 2015.https://dx.doi.org/10.1590/1678-4499.176 * Sprinkler systems-Increases leaf and fruit quality. * Continuous application-Fertilizer is supplied at a constant rate. * Three-stage application-Irrigation starts without fertilizers. Fertilizers are applied later in the process. * Proportional application-Injection rate is proportional to water discharge rate. * Quantitative application-Nutrient solution is applied in a calculated amount to each irrigation block. * Other methods of application include the lateral move, the traveler gun, and solid set systems. ==System design== Fertigation assists distribution of fertilizers for farmers. The simplest type of fertigation system consists of a tank with a pump, distribution pipes, capillaries, and a dripper pen. All systems should be placed on a raised or sealed platform, not in direct contact with the earth. Each system should also be fitted with chemical spill trays. Because of the potential risk of contamination in the potable (drinking) water supply, a backflow prevention device is required for most fertigation systems. Backflow requirements may vary greatly. Therefore, it is very important to understand the proper level of backflow prevention required by law. In the United States, the minimum backflow protection is usually determined by state regulation. Each city or town may set the level of protection required. ==See also== * Sustainable agriculture * Soil defertilisation * Water conservation * Drip irrigation * Foliar feeding ==ReferencesBibliography== # Asadi, M.E., 1998. \\"Water and nitrogen management to reduce impact of nitrates\\".

During the following years, he cared for the D. David-Weill collection, which included Chinese porcelains, Greek and Roman antiquities, and European decorative arts and paintings. In 1928, Rivi√®re curated his first show of ancient American art at the Mus√©e des Arts D√©coratifs and joined Paul Rivet as his vice-director to begin the renovation of the dusty Mus√©e du Trocad√©ro, which was reintroduced to the public as a fully modernized Mus√©e de l'Homme in 1938. In 1929 and 1930, Rivi√®re was on the editorial board of Documents, to which he also contributed articles, such as ‚ÄúThe Ethnographical museum of the Trocad√©ro\\" (1929, issue 1), as well as chronicles on popular culture such as ‚ÄúReligion and ‚ÄòFolies-Berg√®re‚Äô‚Äù (1930, issue 4), and profiles on jazz musicians such as Eddie South and Hayman Swayze. During the thirties, Rivi√®re financed ambitious research projects such as the Dakar-Djibouti mission, headed by Marcel Griaule, and the Sahara-Soudan mission, which provided in-depth research and enough material for over seventy ethnographic exhibitions between 1928 and 1937. That year, he launched the Mus√©e National des Arts et Traditions Populaires, also based on the Trocad√©ro museum's ethnographic collections. Oriented toward public education, its collection and exhibitions programme first focused on popular traditional art forms before dedicating itself to science and research with the introduction of the Centre d'Ethnologie Fran√ßaise, inaugurated shortly after the Second World War. Between 1948 and 1965, Georges-Henri Rivi√®re served as the first acting director of ICOM, the International Council of Museums, to which he returned as Permanent Advisor in 1968.

One of his greatest achievements was taking the Sweden national football team to a World Cup final, and he also managed them to an Olympic gold medal. Before 1966 FIFA World Cup, he was the only Englishman to put a national team into a Final of a World Cup. ==Playing career== Raynor first played football in the non-Leagues for Elsecar Bible Class, Mexborough Athletic and Wombwell. When he did sign professional forms Raynor's career took him only on an uninspired jaunt around the Football League. His first professional club was Sheffield United whom he joined in 1930, making only one first team appearance in the two years he was with the club. Between 1932 and 1939 he played for four different League clubs, the last of these (Aldershot) in the truncated season before the start of the War. He signed up as a physical training instructor (PTI) in 1939 in order to train soldiers in the British Army. The Football Association had requested that all professional footballers become PTIs if they were not inclined to see active service. Raynor was posted to Iraq and whilst in the course of working as a training instructor in Baghdad, he helped a fellow teacher club together a group of students into a team which toured the neighbouring states as a representative of Iraq. His work in Iraq came to the notice of the Secretary of the FA Stanley Rous. Thereafter, as Brian Glanville notes (with some poetic licence) in his The Story of the World Cup for The Sunday Times (1973), \\"the FA whisked him in 1946 from reserve team trainer at Aldershot to the team managership of Sweden\\". During 1939 he was a 'guest' WW2 player with Aldershot, Bournemouth, Bury, Clapton Orient with 1 appearance, Crystal Palace and Hull City. Source: Neilson N. Kaufman, historian Leyton Orient FC. ==Sweden manager== Raynor was an irascible, indefatigable figure, character notes that possibly aligned him more to a responsive Sweden than they ever would in conservative England and accordingly, with his insights into club management coming to the fore, Sweden quickly developed into a force. Under his tutelage, Sweden gave England a scare before losing 4‚Äì2 at Highbury in 1947. 1948 Olympic Games The following year Sweden won the 1948 Olympic Games title defeating Yugoslavia 3‚Äì1 in the final, in front of 60,000 at Wembley. This was after having surpassed Austria, Denmark and South Korea in the earlier stages. At that stage Raynor was assisted by Putte Kock. They had assessed the team and decided that Nils Liedholm and Kjell Ros√©n could work effectively as defensive midfielders. The team had a core of players who would go on to play in Italy's Serie A championship. Gunnar Gren, Gunnar Nordahl and Liedholm (later called Gre-No-Li) formed an inventive striking force and each was picked up by Italian scouts following the gold-medal victory. Raynor remains the last English manager to lead a team to Olympic Gold. 1950 World Cup Divested of his best players and belaboured by the constraints of domestic initiative whereby professionals were barred from playing for the national side, Raynor was still able to qualify the side for the 1950 FIFA World Cup in Brazil where the team overcame Italy and finished in third place; losing 3‚Äì2 to the eventual champions, Uruguay, after they were beaten 7‚Äì1 by a brilliant Brazilian team. 1952 Olympic Games Raynor was still in charge of the national side for their Bronze medal performance at the 1952 Olympic Games in Helsinki and coached the national side during a two-game tour in late Autumn 1953. One of those games included an international against Hungary in Budapest on 15 November. Raynor is reputed to have said: \\"If we win, I'll paint [the Stalin statue's] moustache red.\\" The game finished 2‚Äì2 (Kurt Hamrin, the Swedish right-winger, hitting the cross-bar in the final minute), against the brilliant Hungarian Golden Team, who had remained undefeated for over four years. On the journey back to Sweden, Raynor met Walter Winterbottom in Vienna and explained to him how to play the Hungarians, using man-to-man marking to cut out the threat of N√°ndor Hidegkuti. Winterbottom did not follow the advice and this, in part, led to England's losing their home record against Hungary at Wembley Stadium on 22 November 1953. 1958 World Cup By that stage the Swedish FA had decided to allow professionalism in domestic football, but there was still the need to go cap in hand to the Italian clubs in order to confirm the selection of Kurt Hamrin (from Padova) and Liedholm (at A.C. Milan) and there was still a need to convince the Swedish public of the need to play 'foreigners' in the national side. Raynor said \\"It would have been impossible for us to meet world-class opposition without such performers as Liedholm, Gren, Hamrin and Skoglund. Some people thought it wrong to play these '[Italians' as the side was not representative of Swedish football. Perhaps it wasn't, but it was representative of the footballers Sweden produced.\\" Raynor managed Sweden to the final against Brazil; a 3‚Äì1 win against 1954 FIFA World Champions West Germany confirmed their quality. He famously said that if Sweden get the first goal in the Final 'Brazil would panic all over the show'. Up to that stage the Brazilians had yet to go a goal down and when they were held, particularly by the Welsh in the quarter-final, they had struggled to unlock the defence. As it happened the Swedes did score first; Liedholm scoring after four minutes, but Brazil rode the set-back and both Pel√© and Vav√° scored a brace in a 5‚Äì2 victory for the South Americans. The runners-up place is still the greatest achievement ever for Sweden in a major football competition. ==Club manager== Raynor drifted back and forth into club management throughout this time with AIK in Stockholm (from 1948 to 1951), Lazio in Rome (during the 1954‚Äì55 season) and Coventry City FC in England (for five months in 1956) but was back as national manager for the 1958 FIFA World Cup held in Sweden. During his time at Coventry, he was asked to be the trainer for the Third Division South representative team in 1956‚Äì57. ==Later career== Nine years after these triumphs Raynor was being made redundant after a seven-month stint managing Doncaster Rovers in the English Fourth Division.

It passes through the Hakk≈çda mountain range and links the town of Shichinohe with the city of Aomori. The Hakk≈çda Tunnel is part of the northern section of the T≈çhoku Shinkansen, located between Shichinohe-Towada and Shin Aomori stations. ==Description== The Hakk≈çda Tunnel, with a length of is the longest double-tracked, single-tube terrestrial railway tunnel in the world and the longest terrestrial railway tunnel in Japan, though the Oshima Tunnel in southern Hokkaido is set to surpass it upon its planned completion in 2031. It is also the first rail route to pass through the Hakk≈çda Mountains. The east portal of the tunnel lies from Shichinohe-Towada Station in Shichinohe. From there the tunnel runs parallel to the Michinoku Toll Road, an older limited-access road that travels across the northern Hakk≈çda Mountains by a series of long tunnels. The west portal of the tunnel lies at the eastern bank of the Komagome River in Aomori. The completion of the tunnel and the subsequent extension of the T≈çhoku Shinkansen to Aomori resulted in a decrease in the length of a trip from Tokyo to Aomori by 40 minutes and the elimination of the Tsugaru express train between Hachinohe and Aomori. ==History== Background The Hakk≈çda Tunnel under construction The Hakk≈çda Mountains have divided what is now Aomori Prefecture since the Edo period. The lands to the east of the mountains were controlled by the Nanbu clan and the lands to the west were controlled by the Tsugaru clan. After the Meiji Restoration, their lands were reorganized into Aomori Prefecture with the city of Aomori as its capital. However, no direct land route was available between and the former center of the Nanbu's Hachinohe Domain, Hachinohe because of the mountains. The Edo era ≈åsh≈´ Kaid≈ç instead went north around the mountain range, closely following the rocky coast in many places, such as Asamushi Onsen. When the T≈çhoku Main Line was built to connect Aomori to Tokyo, the same indirect path was utilized. Efforts were still made to cross the Hakk≈çda Mountains. In an exercise to prepare for the destruction of the railway during a war with the Russian Empire, the Hakk≈çda Mountains incident occurred when 199 soldiers of the Imperial Japanese Army got lost and died, just south of where the tunnel now lies.Death March on Mount Hakk≈çda. Google Books. Retrieved on 10 November 2008. The first direct connection between Aomori and Hachinohe, the Michinoku Toll Road, was completed on 13 November 1980. The toll road utilized many tunnels to cross the Hakk≈çda Mountains and set the precedent for a high-speed rail route to supplement it and the indirect T≈çhoku Main Line. Construction Preliminary work on the tunnel began in August 1998, with ground broken in June 1999. On its breakthrough on 27 February 2005, it surpassed the Iwate-Ichinohe Tunnel of the same T≈çhoku Shinkansen to become the world's longest terrestrial (land-based) tunnel. This record was surpassed only two months later by the L√∂tschberg Base Tunnel in Switzerland, and in turn by the Gotthard Base Tunnel when it opened in 2016. However, the L√∂tschberg Base Tunnel has only a single track for most of its length, while the Gotthard Base Tunnel has two single-track tubes, and therefore the Hakk≈çda Tunnel remains the longest double-tracked, single-tube terrestrial railway tunnel in the world. Opening Test runs of the Shinkansen in the tunnel commenced on 19 November 2010, an emergency evacuation of the train in the tunnel was exercised. JR East's T≈çhoku Shinkansen officially began services through the tunnel between Shichinohe-Towada Station and Shin-Aomori Station on 4 December 2010. ==ReferencesBibliography== * ==External links== *Kajima Corporation site Category:Railway tunnels in Japan Category:T≈çhoku Shinkansen Category:Buildings and structures in Aomori Prefecture Category:Tunnels completed in 2010 Category:Transport in Aomori Prefecture ","title":"Hakk≈çda Tunnel"},{"id":"5600197","text":"Prince Gustaf of Sweden and Norway, Duke of Uppland (Frans Gustaf Oscar, 18 June 1827 - 24 September 1852), also known officially as Gustav, was the second son of Oscar I of Sweden and Josephine of Leuchtenberg, and the younger brother of Prince (from 1844 Crown Prince) Charles. ==Life== During his childhood he was placed in the care of the royal governess countess Christina Ulrika Taube.Gustaf Elgenstierna, Den introducerade svenska adelns √§ttartavlor. 1925-36.

He was one of Kongo's most powerful and important kings, who succeeded his father √Ålvaro I, but not until resolving a dispute with his brother. Both sides brought armies to S√£o Salvador but to avoid bloodshed they agreed to single combat, won by √Ålvaro. √Ålvaro faced serious problems with other nobles besides his brother, and in 1590-91 was racked by a serious, though poorly documented, civil war. In order to reestablish his authority, √Ålvaro had to accept the virtual independence of Miguel, the count of Soyo. In order to recognize those nobles who had been loyal to him during this struggle, √Ålvaro began granting habits of the Order of Christ to his followers. Although the Portuguese crown complained to the Pope about this, claiming that the King of Portugal, as Grand Master of the Order was the only one to grant such habits, in fact, Kongo kings would establish this order (see Order of Christ (Kongo Empire)) and continued to knight their followers in it right through the nineteenth century. During √Ålvaro's reign, the capital city, S√£o Salvador was recognized as the capital of the diocese of then Portuguese Congo and Angola, and the first bishop was appointed, in 1596. However, because the kings of Portugal claimed the right of Padroado (patronage), they chose their own bishop. Constant struggles between the king and the bishop followed. Kongo's relations with Portuguese Angola worsened during √Ålvaro's reign, and he complained bitterly about the behaviour of the governors to the King of Spain (then also ruling Portugal during the period of the Iberian Union).

John Henry therefore was the younger brother of Emperor Charles IV. At the time of his birth, the marriage of his parents was already broken; his mother fled to the court of their son-in-law Duke Henry XIV of Bavaria, and John Henry was raised in Cham, Upper Palatinate. ==County of Tyrol== King John made attempts to reconcile with his former rival Henry, duke of Carinthia and count of Tyrol, whom he had deposed as king of Bohemia in 1310. In 1327, his younger son John Henry and Henry's daughter, Countess Margaret of Tyrol, were betrothed. As Henry had no sons, King John expected a considerable enlargement of the Luxembourg lands and control over the Tyrolean mountain passes to Italy. John Henry and Margaret were married on 16 September 1330 at Innsbruck. Their suzerain, Emperor Louis IV, in the same year secretly promised Carinthia, the March of Carniola, and large parts of Tyrol to Henry's nephews Dukes Albert II and Otto of Austria. Henry died on 2 April 1335, and Emperor Louis IV consequently gave Carinthia and southern Tyrol including the overlordship of the prince-bishoprics of Trent and Brixen to the Austrian dukes. King John felt deprived. He put an end to his quarrels with King Casimir III of Poland and campaigned in Austria. A peace was concluded at the city of Enns on 9 October 1336, when John renounced Carinthia, while Margaret and John Henry gained Tyrol. John Henry's brother Charles acted as regent for his 14-year-old brother John Henry and soon came into conflict with the Tyrolian nobility. Furthermore, John Henry and his wife had developed a strong aversion to each other. Margaret finally took the lead of the insurgence against her husband, when she refused him the access to Castle Tyrol on 1 November 1341. John Henry fled to the Patriarchal State of Aquileia, while his wife claimed that their marriage had never been consummated. Margaret was backed by Emperor Louis IV, who himself had plans to assure the Tyrolian heritage for the House of Wittelsbach. He had the scholars Marsilius of Padua and William of Ockham render an opinion that the marriage was not valid. In 1342, Margaret took her inheritance of Tirol to her next husband, the Emperor's eldest son Margrave Louis I of Brandenburg. Humiliated, John Henry returned to Bohemia. Furious King John allied with Pope Clement VI, who banned both Louis and Margaret; nevertheless, the Luxembourg rule over Tyrol was terminated. In 1346 John died in the Battle of Cr√©cy and was succeeded by his eldest son, Charles. ==Margraviate of Moravia== After John Henry's marriage was conclusively terminated according to canon law in 1349, he married Margaret, daughter of Duke Nicholas II of Opava, and Charles IV gave him the Margraviate of Moravia as appanage. In turn, John henry had to renounce all rights to the Bohemian throne. His second marriage produced several sons, including the future Margrave Jobst of Moravia. After Margaret of Opava died in 1363, John Henry married Margaret, the daughter of Duke Albert II of Austria and widow of Margaret of Tyrol's son from her marriage with Louis, Count Meinhard III of Tyrol. John Henry is buried at St Thomas's Abbey, in Brno. == Genealogy == { width=\\"100%\\" center; vertical- align:middle;\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" -  colspan=\\"2\\"  Henry VII 12 July 1275(6) ‚Äì 24 August 1313  colspan=\\"2\\"   colspan=\\"2\\" Margaret of Brabant 4 October 1276 ‚Äì 14 December 1311  colspan=\\"2\\"   colspan=\\"2\\"  Wenceslaus II 27 September 1271 ‚Äì 21 June 1305  colspan=\\"2\\"   colspan=\\"2\\"  Judith of Habsburg 13 March 1271 ‚Äì 18 June 1297 -  style=\\"border-right:1px black solid;\\"   colspan=\\"4\\" style=\\"border-bottom:1px black solid; border-right:1px black solid;\\"   colspan=\\"4\\" style=\\"\\"   colspan=\\"4\\" style=\\"border-bottom:1px black solid; border-left:1px black solid;\\"   style=\\"border-left:1px black solid;\\"  -  colspan=\\"3\\"   colspan=\\"8\\" style=\\"border-left:1px black solid; border-right:1px black solid;\\"   colspan=\\"3\\"  -  colspan=\\"2\\"   colspan=\\"2\\"  John of Bohemia 10 August 1296 ‚Äì 26 August 1346  colspan=\\"6\\"   colspan=\\"2\\"  Elisabeth of Bohemia 20 January 1292 ‚Äì 28 September 1330  colspan=\\"2\\"  -  colspan=\\"3\\" style=\\"border-right:1px black solid;\\"   colspan=\\"8\\" style=\\"border- bottom:1px black solid;\\"   colspan=\\"3\\" style=\\"border-left:1px black solid;\\"  -  colspan=\\"7\\" style=\\"border-right:1px black solid;\\"   colspan=\\"7\\"  -  width=\\"7.14%\\"  width=\\"7.14%\\"  width=\\"7.14%\\"  width=\\"7.14%\\"  width=\\"7.14%\\"  width=\\"7.14%\\"  width=\\"7.14%\\"  width=\\"7.14%\\"  width=\\"7.14%\\"  width=\\"7.14%\\"  width=\\"7.14%\\"  width=\\"7.14%\\"  width=\\"7.14%\\"  width=\\"7.14%\\" - } { style=\\"width:100%; text-align:center; vertical-align:top;\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" - style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"  colspan=\\"2\\"  1 Margaret of Tyrol 1318 ‚Äì 3 October 1369 OO 16 September 1330, div.1342  colspan=\\"2\\"  2 Margaret of Opava 26 September 1329 ‚Äì 1363 OO March 1350  colspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"vertical-align:middle;\\" John Henry 12\\\\.

The group was headed by Carol Lou Hedges (born May 20, 1931, Peru, Indiana), whose modest demeanor belied her piano virtuosity and swinging style. Husband and bassist John Hedges was the other permanent member of the group, with various drummers having been employed, including future drummer for the Count Basie band and Tony Bennett, Harold Jones (drummer) in 1956-57. The trio's reputation spread mostly by word of mouth, but it did release several singles and one album.Carol Lou Trio, URL accessed October 1, 2010 Having remarried, Carol Lou Woodward continued to play as a soloist and in small combos in and around her home since 1957, Richmond, Indiana, where Gennett Records produced important early jazz recording, including the first by Louis Armstrong. In 2013 Woodward recorded an album for the Starr-Gennett Foundation called ‚ÄúRags to Richmond: A Tribute to Ragtime and Starr Piano.‚Äù The album includes three compositions by erstwhile Richmond resident May Aufderheide, a leading female ragtime composer. In 2006, Woodward released a CD featuring solo piano arrangements of jazz and popular music standards, \\"An Evening With Carol Lou\\". In 2008 she released a holiday collection titled ‚ÄúChristmas With Carol Lou.\\" She has said that her favorite pianist is Gene Harris, whose style has been described as \\"hard-swinging, soulful, blues- drenched\\".

K. Asante, Jr. It has won five international film festival awards in the category of Best Documentary, including the UNESCO \\"Breaking the Chains\\" award.\\"500 Years Later\\" at Cinema Politica.\\"Re-Storying Africa\\", Gauteng Film Commission, 2008. It has won other awards including Best Documentary at the Pan African Film Festival in Los Angeles, Best Documentary at the Bridgetown Film Festival in Barbados, Best Film at the International Black Cinema Film Festival in Berlin, and Best International Documentary at the Harlem International Film Festival in New York. 500 Years Later has received praise and controversy, both for its creative documentary genre, and its social-political impact with relation to race study. The film premiered on February 28, 2005, at the Pan-African Awards (PAFF) and won Best Documentary there. It made its American television premiere on August 23, 2008, on TV One (Radio One), and Ethiopian Television premiere on October 27, 2007. It was shown nationally in South Africa on December 14, 2014, on SABC 2.TV Schedule for SABC2, 2014-12-14.TV Schedule for SABC2, 2014-12-21. In 2010, the sequel, Motherland, was released. ==Plot== 500 Years Later studies the African diaspora and the impact of slavery throughout history, identifying key issues facing the world's black communities, including poor education, poverty, crime, and the way that such issues dehumanize and degrade black peoples. The film also gives insight into the struggles faced by continental Africans today, for instance in terms of poverty, disease, and corrupt governments. While the continuing negative impact, influence, and effects of the trans- Atlantic slave trade are highlighted, scholars interviewed for the film express hope that \\"old scars can be healed\\" and Africans as a race will advance through education about their history. Narrative The film states that the lasting effects of slavery are still felt 500 years later, hence the title. This is justified and explained through a series of scholarly interviews throughout the film. The film begins with an adage that illustrates its historical theme: \\"Until lions tell their story, the tale of the hunt will always glorify the hunter.\\" The promotional page for the producer of the film describes it thusly: \\"500 Years Later is a compelling journey, infused with the spirit and music of liberation, that chronicles the struggle of a people from enslavement who continue to fight for the most essential human right - freedom.\\" The film presents the richness of African cultures and traditions and how they have evolved since slavery was abolished, emphasizing that prior to the beginning of the Atlantic Slave Trade Africans were free. The film includes testimonies, voices, and opinions gathered around five continents. Many of the people who voice their opinion are scholars or experts on the African diaspora. Those interviewed in the film criticize contemporary rap music as being particularly negative for Africans and their descendants, as they believe it reinforced racist stereotypes that were established in part because of the slave trade. A lasting example of the stereotypes referenced in the film is a study performed by Kenneth and Mamie Clark in which black children were given a variety of dolls, including black and white ones, and were told to pick the \\"smarter\\" or \\"better\\" one. A majority of the black children chose the white dolls. Many of those interviewed believe that a distinct change to the educational system is necessary to change the mindset of people of African descent. The film affirms that \\"the kind of education that we have is to still enslave our minds, to make us believe we are inferior.\\" Education should be the main weapon for the new generations of Africans and African descendants, to remind the world of the richness and struggle of African history. At the end of the film, Africans are encouraged to remember their past, in order to move forward. The film promotes the idea that making it through enslavement should be a strength, not a weakness or something to be ashamed about; that the people who enslaved the Africans should be the ones that are ashamed. Essentially, the goal proposed is to teach African children a more Afrocentric history, instead of a Eurocentric one. It further argues that teaching African-descent people about a history that is not their own will not help because they cannot relate to it. It also indicates that society must establish and promote African ideas and history in order to preserve what they want for future generations. The film calls for the ideas promoted within it to become mainstream so that there can be a better Africa and a better history associated with the continent.500 Years Later == Cast == The cast features key figures from the African-American academic world. *Maulana Karenga *Francis Cress Welsing *Paul Robeson, Jr. *Andrew Muhammad *Kimani Nehusi *Hakim Adi *M.

The award was part of an UNESCO slave route project started in 1994: \\"The prize awarded $10,000 to a film that breaks the silence and speaks to the social, historical, economic and psychological impact of the slave trade; a film that raises public awareness of slavery's historical and contemporary manifestations; a film that gives voice to the dispossessed, reflects their perspectives and articulates their resistance to this dehumanization.\\"Swahiliweb.net UNESCO launched the Slave Route Project in 1994. This project seeks to increase knowledge and understanding in terms of slavery and historical events related to it.The Slave Route, UNESCO, retrieved 24 October 2019 ==Reception== Kingsley Sheteh, from A Neo-Copernican Review, asserts that 500 Years Later is a step in the right direction in depicting the relationship between the Western world and Africa, showcasing the historically dependent and underdeveloped status of African countries. Shetah also pointed out that, although the movie does well with sensitive issues that are causes for Africa's problems, it fails to treat the issue of conflict. Shetah cites reasons that independent African state governments are heavily corrupted due to problems that can't be simply be tied down to ideology, slavery, and colonialism. While not exactly presenting new information, the documentary's delivery of the material and evidence is refreshing, meant to promote discussion among groups of people. 500 Years Later holds a 6.8/10 rating on IMDb.com from over 150 users. It also holds an audience approval rating of 88% on rotten tomatoes from over 340 voters, and has an average rating of 4.2 out of 5. Many critics received the film as a way to explore African history like never before. The film is a compilation of interviews that offer history from the perspective of people whose knowledge has been suppressed for years. \\"500 Years Later\\" is applauded for its vast focus on African history, both the good and the bad. Though successful, 500 Years Later received mixed reviews from critics regarding content and presentation. Dan Schindel, a documentary reviewer, calls the film \\"The Malcolm X to the MLK of the average doc that covers African-related material\\" and offers many examples of the extremity of the film. The article \\"Destroying the Horrors of 500 Years\\" by Attahiru Kawu- Bala praised the film as an \\"articulate multi-dimensional African world perspective\\" with regard to the effects of African Diaspora. Kawu-Bala argued that the techniques used in the documentary did not rely on emotion and instead used facts and truth to build a case from an African standpoint. By contrast, Curt Holman recognized the film's righteousness, but believed \\"a more informative film would have been more effective.\\" He found the video to be emotionally charged and, at times, overly obvious. According to Holman, the emotional biases sometimes overshadowed the factual content. Wanuri Kahiu, a Kenyan film director, states that the film is a discussion between the \\"greatest and most articulate thinkers of the African global nation.\\" In his review of 500 Years Later, Kahiu wrote that the documentary should not be referred to as a film but rather an \\"audiovisual reference book\\" because of how informative the documentary is. According to Kahiu, 500 Years Later is a good resource to show the challenges people of African descent faced during the Diaspora and slavery and the challenges they still face today. He further states that the film is a great representation of the strength of African- American culture and citizenry, and claims that the movie is a call for African people to patiently work to rid the African world of the \\"defeatist nature\\" still subconsciously ingrained in them today. ==See also== * African holocaust * African-American history * Afrocentrism * List of films featuring slavery * List of American films of 2005 * Maafa *Motherland * Twelve Years a Slave ==References== * The Slave Route - UNESCO project == External links == * Official 500 Years Later\\" homepage * \\"500 Years Later and the legacy of Africa's enslavement\\" by Charlie Kimber * Motherland film (sequel to 500 Years Later) * Halaqah Films * * \\"Breaking the Chains\\" Unesco Prize Jury Statement ‚Äì ZIFF, 5th July, 2007 * Owen Alik Shahadah - Official Site Category:2005 films Category:2005 documentary films Category:Documentary films about African Americans Category:American independent films Category:American films Category:Documentary films about slavery Category:African diaspora Category:Documentary films about African politics Category:British documentary films Category:British films Category:British independent films Category:English-language films Category:Films set in Africa Category:Films shot in Senegal Category:Films about race and ethnicity Category:Documentary films about the civil rights movement Category:Documentary films about slavery in the United States Category:Films directed by Owen 'Alik Shahadah Category:Films shot in Ghana Category:Films shot in Egypt Category:Films shot in Ethiopia Category:Films shot in Barbados Category:Films shot in Lebanon Category:Films shot in Grenada Category:Films shot in Mali ","title":"500 Years Later"},{"id":"5600260","text":"Spin the Wheel is the second album by Irish girl group, Bellefire.

Observers usually undergo special training to ensure neutrality, diplomacy, and deescalation techniques. ==Duties and responsibilities== * Monitor the various agreements on cease-fires, withdrawals and demilitarization. * Ground, sea and aerial patrolling of both sides of the conflict, including the areas along the confrontation lines. * Patrol demilitarized zone. * Help resolve local difficulties (social, economic, etc.) by liaison with all sides of the conflict. * Investigate allegations of aggression or ceasefire violations. ==First mission in Kashmir== An early and still-operating observer mission is the United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP), established on the India-Pakistan border in 1949 to monitor the ceasefire called for by the United Nations Security Council.www.un.org/Depts/dpko/photos/unmogip/unmogip5.htmUNMOGIP officersObserving lineDeployment map * Location and Headquarters: ceasefire line in Jammu and Kashmir states with major posts in Rawalpindi, Pakistan / Srinagar, India * Primary observing officer: Croatian Major-General Dragutin Repinc appointed by Kofi Annan * Participating observers: 113 military and civilian personnel, from 8 countries * Casualties: 11 * Time frame: 1949‚Äìpresent ==Similar mission in Timor-Leste== * Location and Headquarters: Republica Democratica Timor-Leste with major post in Dili, formerly East Timor * Primary observing officer: Atul Khare appointed by Kofi Annan * Participating observers: 34 with 1,600 supporting UN Police * Casualties: * Time frame: 2006‚Äìpresent, previous missions UNAMET 1999, UNTAET 1999-2002, UNMISET 2002-2005, and UNOTIL 2005-2006 Timor-Leste map ==ReferencesExternal links== *https://www.un.org/Depts/dpko/missions/unmogip/index.html Category:United Nations Security Council subsidiary organs ","title":"United Nations Military Observer"},{"id":"5600311","text":"Derrynoose () is a village and civil parish in south County Armagh, Northern Ireland, 4.5 km south-west of Keady.

Now retired, he is known to most major NASCAR fans as a NASCAR Busch Series winner, but he won the Molson Tour championship twice and the NASCAR Busch North Series championship twice. His nickname was the \\"Irish Angel.\\" He retired from racing in 1995. He was inducted in the New England Auto Racers Hall of Fame in 2002. ==Accomplishments before major NASCAR== McCabe built his first racecar, a 1936 Chevy 6-cylinder \\"Bomber\\" coupe at age 14, and sneaked his way into a number of races. McCabe joined the NASCAR North (a regional racing series) in 1976, where he competed against Stub Fadden, Beaver and Bobby Dragon, and Robbie Crouch. McCabe won the NASCAR North Championship in 1981, then repeated in '82, when he set the NASCAR North record for the most top 10 finishes in a season. It was also during this period that he became the Oxford Plains Open Champion for 4 consecutive years from 1981 to 1984. McCabe also ran a side business during this time as a bait salesman, Dick would drive his 18-wheel dump truck 12 hours a day to pick up and sell bait to fisherman. His business often appeared on his cars. McCabe moved Busch North Series, where he again won back to back championships, in 1992 and 1993. The 1993 season was extra special, because Dick won track and Busch North Championships in the inaugural season at NHIS ==Busch Series career== As he was competing in the North Series, McCabe followed a common trend among most North drivers in running a part-time Busch Series schedule. McCabe made his debut in 1984 at Daytona, where he started 36th but finished 11th. McCabe returned in 1985, when he ran the #80 McCabe Bait Pontiac to a twelfth-place run in his return to Daytona. It was his only start in that year. McCabe made his Busch debut at Oxford Plains Speedway in 1986, earning his first career top-10 start, a ninth, but an early engine failure left him 43rd in the field. He started twelfth in the #0, the following year at Oxford Plains, and had a fourth-place finish, his first career top-10. McCabe made four starts in 1988. After a twenty-first-place finish at Daytona, McCabe qualified seventh at Oxford, and led 102 laps en route to his first career Busch Series victory. McCabe also added a 19th at IRP before finishing 33rd at Dover. McCabe returned to action for one race in 1989, starting last Richmond, before engine problems sidelined him to 26th. He made two starts the next year, finishing 26th at Oxford and finished 43rd at Loudon after a crash. Despite a 38th place in his season debut at Oxford, McCabe recovered by piloting his #0 in both NHIS races to two top-10 finishes in 1991. He was 9th in the July race and 10th in the October race. McCabe started off 1992 by qualifying for the outside pole at Nazareth Speedway. However, he was wrecked in that race early and finished 35th. He had a 12th-place finish at Loudon that same year. McCabe's two races in 1993 included his debut at Watkins Glen International, racing home to a 15th place. However, McCabe only completed 18 laps at New Hampshire before falling out of the race and to a 44th-place finish. McCabe made his last start in 1994, qualifying 38th and then finished 34th after a mid-race accident. ==References== *McCabe bio ==External links== * Category:Living people Category:1947 births Category:People from Kennebunkport, Maine Category:Racing drivers from Maine Category:NASCAR drivers ","title":"Dick McCabe (racing driver)"},{"id":"5600363","text":"Wilhelm Heinrich \\"Willie\\" Huber (January 15, 1958 ‚Äì June 28, 2010) was a professional ice hockey defenceman who played ten seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) with the Detroit Red Wings, New York Rangers, Vancouver Canucks and Philadelphia Flyers. While a member of the Red Wings, he represented the Campbell Conference in the 1983 NHL All-Star Game. When he joined the Red Wings in 1978, he was the biggest player (6'5\\", 225 lbs.) in NHL history. ==Playing career== Huber was drafted in the first round (9th overall) in the 1978 NHL Amateur Draft by the Detroit Red Wings after a decorated junior career. He won the Memorial Cup with the Hamilton Fincups in 1976, and represented Canada at the 1977 and 1978 World Junior Championships. A rare blend of size and skill, Huber stepped directly into the Wings' lineup the following season, notching 31 points and being named the team's Rookie of the Year. For most of his career (until the arrival of Kjell Samuelsson in 1986) Huber was the largest player in the NHL at 6'5\\" and 228 lbs, towering over most other players in the league. Despite his size, however, Huber was primarily an offensive defender. Blessed with exceptional hands and skating ability, Huber was amongst the league's highest goal-scoring defenders in the early 1980s and a fixture on the Detroit powerplay. While he was also solid in his own zone, fans often - unfairly - expected him to be a nasty physical presence, which did not come as naturally to him. Huber scored at least 14 goals and 40 points for Detroit every season between 1979 and 1983 and was one of the team's top players during a comparatively lackluster period of Red Wing history. Huber and Reed Larson formed one of the more dangerous blueline power-play combinations in the league during this period. He was chosen to represent Canada at the 1981 World Championships and helped the team to a 4th- place finish. In 1983, he was selected to play in the NHL All-Star Game. Following a contract dispute with the Red Wings, Huber was dealt to the New York Rangers in the summer of 1983. He picked up where he left off offensively, but tore ligaments in his left knee midway through the season and was limited to 23 points in just 42 games. The following season, he tore ligaments in his right knee. As a result, his once-excellent mobility declined considerably, as did his offensive production. By 1985‚Äì86, he scored only 15 points in 70 games. He bounced back to score 30 points in 1986‚Äì87, but was traded to the Vancouver Canucks early in 1987‚Äì88. After a short, disappointing stint in Vancouver, he was dealt to the Philadelphia Flyers at the trade deadline, where he experienced a surprise resurgence with 13 points in 10 games. However, following the season Philadelphia wanted him to take a pay cut, and after a resulting season-long holdout he retired in 1989. He finished his 10-year career with 104 goals and 321 points in 655 career games, along with 950 penalty minutes. Following his days in hockey, he chose to remain near the game, working in the operations departments at Copps Coliseum, Hamilton Place, and the Hamilton Convention Centre. ==Death== Huber died of a heart attack on June 28, 2010, in Hamilton, Ontario at age 52. ==Personal== Huber was born in West Germany and moved with his family to Hamilton, Ontario when he was an infant. He was one of five children born to Sonia and Henry Huber. He was married to Dawn and had a step-daughter, Brittany. Holding both German and Canadian citizenship, he represented Canada in international competition. ==Career statistics== Regular season and playoffs { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" center; width:60em\\" - bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" ! colspan=\\"3\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! rowspan=\\"100\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! colspan=\\"5\\"  Regular season ! rowspan=\\"100\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! colspan=\\"5\\"  Playoffs - bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" !

From 1974 to 1980, he studied structural engineering and architecture at the University of Stuttgart. From 1980 to 1986, he was post-graduate fellow in the research project 'Wide-Span Lightweight Structures' at the University of Stuttgart and finished his PhD 1987 in structural engineering. In 1983, Sobek won the Fazlur Khan International Fellowship from the SOM Foundation. In 1991, he became a professor at the Leibniz University Hannover (successor to Bernd Tokarz) and director of the Institute for Structural Design and Building Methods. In 1992 he founded his own company Werner Sobek which now has offices in Stuttgart, Frankfurt, London, Moscow, New York, and Dubai. The company has over 200 employees and works with all types of structures and materials. Its core areas of expertise are lightweight construction, high-rise construction, fa√ßade design, special constructions made from steel, glass, titanium, fabric and wood, as well as the design of sustainable buildings.http://www.wernersobek.com Since 1994, he has been a professor at the University of Stuttgart (successor to Frei Otto) and director of the Institute for Lightweight Structures and of the Central Laboratory for Structural Engineering. In 2000, he took over the chair of J√∂rg Schlaich, and fused the Institute for Lightweight Structures and the Institute for Construction and Design into the Institute for Lightweight Structures and Conceptual Design (ILEK). Both in its research and teaching, the ILEK at the University of Stuttgart unites the aspect of design that is dominant in architecture with the focus on analysis and construction from structural engineering as well as materials science. On the basis of a goal-oriented and interdisciplinary approach, the institute is concerned with the conceptual development of all types of construction and load-bearing structures, using all types of materials. The areas of focus span construction with textiles and glass all the way to new structures in reinforced and prestressed concrete. From the individual details to the whole structure, the approach focuses on the optimisation of form and construction with respect to material and energy use, durability and reliability, recyclability and environmental sustainability. The results of this work are published in the bilingual (German/English) serial from the institute (IL) or published individually in special research reports on particular topics.Stiller, Adolph (ed.): Sketches for the Future. Werner Sobek - Architecture and Construction: A Dialogue. Vienna: Muery Salzmann, 2010. p. 123. In 2008 Werner Sobek was appointed Mies van der Rohe Professor at the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago. In recognition of his manifold academic achievements, the Technical University of Dresden awarded him an honorary doctorate in 2009. Werner Sobek is known for his environmentally sustainable and self-sufficient prototype houses such as R 128 and H16. A well-known concept study by Werner Sobek is \\"R-129\\" which uses a polyurethane skin on a carbon-fibre frame, giving it walls thinner than eggshells. His commitment to sustainability is also reflected in his involvement in the German Sustainable Building Council (DGNB, Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr Nachhaltiges Bauen), which he co-founders in July 2007. He was a member of the DGNB's board of directors until June 2013 and serve as its president from April 2008 to June 2010. In December 2011 he also founded the Stuttgart Institute of Sustainability (SIS), a nonprofit association aiming at the promotion of research on new sustainable building techniques.http://sis- stiftung.de/index.php He presented a keynote address and co-presented in the workshop Reduce CO2 ‚Äì With technology to zero emissions at the 3rd International Holcim Forum 2010 in Mexico City and is on the Jury of the global Holcim Awards 2012.http://www.holcimfoundation.org/T1275/WernerSobek.htm His research into lightweight structures, materials and the associated techniques and technologies is awarded a Global Award for Sustainable Architecture in 2019. == Projects == * Ecole Nationale d'Art D√©coratif, Limoges, France * Interbank, Lima, Peru * Roof over the centercourt of the Am Rothenbaum stadium, Hamburg, Germany * Suvarnabhumi Airport, Bangkok, Thailand * Sony Center, Berlin, Germany * House R 128, Stuttgart, Germany * Aktivhaus B10, Stuttgart, Germany http://www.aktivhaus-b10.de ==Publications (selection)== * Sobek, Werner: Zum Entwerfen im Leichtbau. in: Bauingenieur, 70/1995, pp. 323‚Äì329. * Schittich, C.; Staib, G.; Balkow, D.; Schuler, M.; Sobek, W.: Glasbau Atlas.

SAP ERP incorporates the key business functions of an organization. The latest version of SAP ERP (V.6.0) was made available in 2006. The most recent Enhancement Package (EHP8) for SAP ERP 6.0 was released in 2016. Business Processes included in SAP ERP are Operations (Sales & Distribution, Materials Management, Production Planning, Logistics Execution, and Quality Management), Financials (Financial Accounting, Management Accounting, Financial Supply Chain Management), Human Capital Management (Training, Payroll, e-Recruiting) and Corporate Services (Travel Management, Environment, Health and Safety, and Real-Estate Management). == Development == An ERP was built based on the former SAP R/3 software. SAP R/3, which was officially launched on 6 July 1992, consisted of various applications on top of SAP Basis, SAP's set of middleware programs and tools. All applications were built on top of the SAP Web Application Server. Extension sets were used to deliver new features and keep the core as stable as possible. The Web Application Server contained all the capabilities of SAP Basis. A complete architecture change took place with the introduction of mySAP ERP in 2004. R/3 Enterprise was replaced with the introduction of ERP Central Component (SAP ECC). The SAP Business Warehouse, SAP Strategic Enterprise Management and Internet Transaction Server were also merged into SAP ECC, allowing users to run them under one instance. The SAP Web Application Server was wrapped into SAP NetWeaver, which was introduced in 2003. Architectural changes were also made to support an enterprise service architecture to transition customers to a Service-oriented architecture. The latest version, SAP ERP 6.0, was released in 2006. SAP ERP 6.0 has since then been updated through SAP enhancement packs, the most recent: SAP enhancement package 8 for SAP ERP 6.0 in 2016 == Implementation == SAP ERP consists of several modules, including Financial Accounting (FI), Controlling (CO), Asset Accounting (AA), Sales & Distribution (SD), Material Management (MM), Production Planning (PP), Quality Management (QM), Project System (PS), Plant Maintenance (PM), Human Resources (HR), Warehouse Management (WM). * Phase 1 ‚Äì Project Preparation * Phase 2 ‚Äì Business Blueprint * Phase 3 ‚Äì Realization * Phase 4 ‚Äì Final Preparation * Phase 5 ‚Äì Go Live Support == Deployment and maintenance costs == It is estimated that \\"for a Fortune 500 company, software, hardware, and consulting costs can easily exceed $100 million (around $50 million to $500 million). Large companies can also spend $50 million to $100 million on upgrades. Full implementation of all modules can take years\\", which also adds to the end price. Midsized companies (fewer than 1,000 employees) are more likely to spend around $10 million to $20 million at most, and small companies are not likely to have the need for a fully integrated SAP ERP system unless they have the likelihood of becoming midsized and then the same data applies as would a midsized company. Independent studies have shown that deployment and maintenance costs of a SAP solution can vary depending on the organization. For example, some point out that because of the rigid model imposed by SAP tools, a lot of customization code to adapt to the business process may have to be developed and maintained. Some others pointed out that a return on investment could only be obtained when there was both a sufficient number of users and sufficient frequency of use. ==SAP Transport Management System== SAP Transport Management System (STMS) is a tool within SAP ERP systems to manage software updates, termed transports, on one or more connected SAP systems. The tool can be accessed from transaction code STMS. This should not be confused with SAP Transportation Management, a stand-alone module for facilitating logistics and supply chain management in the transportation of goods and materials. ==SAP Enhancement Packages for SAP ERP 6.0 (SAP EhPs)== The latest version (SAP ERP 6.0) was made available in 2006. Since then, additional functionality for SAP ERP 6.0 has been delivered through SAP Enhancement Packages (EhP). These Enhancement Packages allow SAP ERP customers to manage and deploy new software functionality. Enhancement Packages are optional; customers choose which new capabilities to implement. SAP EhPs do not require a classic system upgrade. The installation process of Enhancement Packages consists of two different steps: * Technical installation of an Enhancement Package * Activation of new functions The technical installation of business functions does not change the system behavior. The installation of new functionalities is decoupled from its activation and companies can choose which business functions they want to activate. This means that even after installing a new business function, there is no change to existing functionality before activation. Activating a business function for one process will have no effect on users working with other functionalities. The most recent SAP Enhancement Package for SAP ERP 6.0 was EhP8, which was released in 2016. EhP8 delivers innovations and serves as a foundation to transition to SAP's new business suite: SAP S/4HANA. == See also == *GuiXT *List of ERP software packages *SAP NetWeaver *SAP GUI *SOA *Secure Network Communications *Secure Socket Layer *T-code == References == *Gargeya, VB 2005, ‚ÄòSuccess and failure factors of adopting SAP in ERP system implementation‚Äô, Business Process Management Journal, Vol.11, No.5, pp501‚Äì516, Retrieved 21/04/2010. *In White Paper Review, Industry Week OCT 2009, ‚ÄòERP Best Practices: The SaaS Difference, Plex Systems, Retrieved 21/04/2012. *Malhorta, A & Temponi, C 2010, ‚ÄòCritical decisions for ERP integration: Small business issues‚Äô, International Journal of Information Management, Vol. 30, Issue No.1, Pages 28‚Äì37, 21/04/2010, Science Direct. == External links == * ERP Category:ERP software ","title":"SAP ERP"},{"id":"5600374","text":"Gabrielle Dee Giffords (born June 8, 1970) is an American politician and gun control advocate who served as a member of the United States House of Representatives representing from January 2007 until January 2012, when she resigned due to a severe brain injury suffered during an assassination attempt. A member of the Democratic Party, Giffords was the third woman in Arizona's history to be elected to the U.S. Congress. Born and raised in Tucson, Arizona, Giffords graduated from Scripps College and Cornell University. After initially moving to New York City, where she worked in regional economic development for Price Waterhouse, Giffords returned to Arizona to work as the CEO of El Campo Tire Warehouses, a family business started by her grandfather. She served in the Arizona House of Representatives from 2001 until 2003 and the Arizona Senate from 2003 until 2005 when she was elected to the U.S. House. Giffords had just begun her third term in January 2011 when she was shot in the head in an assassination attempt and mass shooting just outside of Tucson during an event with constituents. Giffords has since recovered much of her ability to walk, speak, read, and write. She was greeted by a standing ovation upon her return to the House floor in August 2011. She attended President Obama's State of the Union address on January 24, and appeared on the floor of the House on January 25, 2012, where she formally submitted her resignation to a standing ovation and accolades from her colleagues and the leadership of the House. Though a moderate on the issue during her time in Congress, Giffords has since become an ardent advocate for gun control. In January 2013, she and her husband launched Americans for Responsible Solutions, a non-profit organization and Super-PAC which later joined with the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence to become Giffords. She is married to former Space Shuttle Commander Mark Kelly, who is currently running for a seat in the U.S. Senate. ==Early life, education, and business career== Gabrielle Dee Giffords was born in and grew up in Tucson, Arizona; her parents were Gloria Kay (n√©e Fraser) and Spencer J. Giffords. She was raised in a mixed religious environment, as her mother was a Christian Scientist and her father was Jewish. Her paternal grandfather, Akiba Hornstein, was a Jewish emigrant from Lithuania who changed his name to Giffords to avoid anti- Semitism in the United States. Through her father, Giffords is a second cousin of actress Gwyneth Paltrow and director Jake Paltrow. Giffords graduated from Tucson's University High School. She is a former Girl Scout. She received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Sociology and Latin American History from Scripps College in California in 1993; and spent a year as a Fulbright Scholar in Chihuahua, Mexico. She returned to graduate school, earning a Master's degree in Regional Planning from Cornell University in 1996. She focused her studies on Mexican-American relations. Giffords worked as an associate for regional economic development at Price Waterhouse in New York City. In 1996, she became president and CEO of El Campo Tire Warehouses, a local chain of auto service centers founded by her grandfather. The business was sold to Goodyear Tire in 2000. At the time of the sale, she commented on the difficulties local businesses face when competing against large national firms. Since 2001, she has practiced Judaism exclusively and belongs to Congregation Chaverim, a Reform synagogue, in Tucson. ==Arizona legislature== Elections Giffords switched her party affiliation from Republican to Democratic in 2000 and was elected to the Arizona House of Representatives from 2001 to 2003.PROFILE: Rep. Gabrielle Giffords: Dem who wins in conservative district She was elected to the Arizona Senate in the fall of 2002, and at the time was the youngest woman elected to that body. She took office in January 2003 and was re-elected in 2004. She resigned from the Arizona Senate on December 1, 2005, in preparation for her congressional campaign. Tenure In early 2005, Giffords observed that \\"the 2004 election took its toll on our bipartisan coalition\\" and that as a result \\"a number of significant problems will receive far less attention than they deserve.\\" She highlighted among these, the lack of high-paying jobs or necessary infrastructure, rapid growth, and inward migration that threatened the environment and \\"strain[ed] [‚Ä¶] education, health care, and transportation,\\" and unresolved problems such as Students First; Arnold v. Sarn; repayments due under Ladewig v. Arizona; the No Child Left Behind mandate; low educational achievement; health care costs; and the demands of the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System. She noted that Arizona was not alone in facing such challenges. Expanding health care access was an issue of interest for Giffords when she served in the legislature. She also pushed for bills related to mental health and was named by the Mental Health Association of Arizona as the 2004 Legislator of the Year. Giffords earned the Sierra Club's Most Valuable Player award. In the legislature, Giffords worked on the bipartisan Children's Caucus, which sought to improve education and health care for Arizona's children. Critics of this plan argued that it amounted to taxpayer-funded daycare. She worked with Arizona Governor Janet Napolitano to promote all-day kindergarten. Giffords supported raising more money for schools \\"through sponsorship of supplemental state aid through bonds and tax credits that could be used for school supplies.\\" She was awarded Arizona Family Literacy's Outstanding Legislator for 2003. ==U.S. House of Representatives== Giffords in 2008 Elections ;2006 Giffords launched her first candidacy for the U.S. Congress on January 24, 2006. The campaign received national attention early on as a likely pick-up for the Democratic Party. Prominent Democrats, including Tom Daschle, Robert Reich, Janet Napolitano, and Bill Clinton, endorsed Giffords. EMILY's List endorsed Giffords early in the campaign cycle. The Sierra Club and the Arizona Education Association also endorsed her. On September 12, 2006, Giffords won her party's nomination in the primary election. Her Republican opponent in the general election was Randy Graf, a conservative former state senator known for his enforcement-only position on immigration and illegal aliens. Graf had run against Jim Kolbe in the 2004 GOP primary and had announced his candidacy in 2006 before Kolbe announced his retirement. The Republican establishment was somewhat cool toward Graf, believing he might be too conservative for the district. The national GOP took the unusual step of endorsing one of the more moderate candidates in the primary. Graf won anyway, helped by a split in the Republican moderate vote between two candidates. Not long after the primary, Congressional Quarterly changed its rating of the race to \\"Leans Democrat\\". By late September, the national GOP had pulled most of its funding, effectively conceding the seat to Giffords. Giffords won the race on November 7, 2006, with 54 percent of the vote. Graf received 42 percent. The rest of the vote went to minor candidates. Giffords's victory was portrayed as evidence that Americans are accepting towards comprehensive immigration reform. She was the first woman with a Jewish father elected to Congress from Arizona. ;2008 In 2008, Giffords was elected to a second term. Republican Tim Bee, a childhood classmate and former colleague in the Arizona State Senate, ran against her. Bee was the President of the Arizona State Senate and considered a strong challenger in this race. Despite native son John McCain's running as the Republican presidential candidate, Giffords was reelected with 56.20 percent of the vote to Bee's 41.45 percent. ;2010 Giffords during a press conference following her 2010 election victory On November 5, 2010, Giffords was declared the victor after a close race against Republican Jesse Kelly. Kelly, an Iraq War veteran (and not related to Mark Kelly), was listed as a top-ten Tea Party candidate to watch by Politico, and described by The Arizona Republic as highly conservative even compared to Sarah Palin. Giffords had been targeted for defeat by Sarah Palin's political action committee, SarahPAC. Giffords participated in the reading of the United States Constitution on the floor of the House of Representatives on January 6, 2011; she read the First Amendment. Tenure Giffords in 2008 Following the November 2006 election, Giffords was sworn in as a congresswoman on January 3, 2007. She was the third woman in Arizona's history to be elected to serve in the U.S. Congress. In her inaugural speech on the floor of the House of Representatives, Giffords advocated a comprehensive immigration reform package, including modern technology to secure the border, more border patrol agents, tough employer sanctions for businesses that knowingly hire illegal immigrants, and a guest- worker program. In her first month in office, Giffords voted in favor of increased federal funding for embryonic stem-cell research; raising the minimum wage; endorsing the 9/11 Commission recommendations; new rules for the House of Representatives targeting ethical issues; and the repeal of $14 billion of subsidies to big oil companies, in favor of renewable energy subsidies and the founding of the Strategic Renewable Energy Reserve. During the 2007 session of Congress, Giffords introduced a bill (H.R. 1441)THOMAS Search Results: H.R.1441. Library of Congress.

Aero-News Network, June 13, 2007. Retrieved March 9, 2008. Giffords advocated for a national day of recognition for cowboys as one of her first actions. She voted for the contentious May 2007 Iraq Emergency Supplemental Spending bill, saying, \\"I cannot, in good conscience, allow the military to run out of money while American servicemen and women are being attacked every day\\".Stanton, Billie. Stanton: Democrats damned by Iraq war vote. Tucson Citizen June 5, 2007. Retrieved March 9, 2008. She has also been a Girl Scout supporter for many years. On April 21, 2007, Giffords hosted her third \\"Congress on Your Corner\\" in Tucson, Arizona, and kicked things off by speaking to the Girl Scouts of Southern Arizona, Sahuaro Council. Giffords was a member of the Blue Dog Coalition and the New Democrat Coalition. She was a co-founder of the Congressional Motorcycle Safety Caucus. Until her husband's retirement, she was the only member of the U.S. Congress whose spouse was an active duty member of the U.S. military. She is also known as a strong proponent of solar energy as well as for her work to secure the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States border.

A man ran up to the crowd and began firing a 9mm pistol with a 33-round magazine, hitting 19 people, and killing six, among them federal judge John Roll and a 9-year-old child, Christina-Taylor Green.http://usat.ly/1OEefAv  Family of Ariz. shooting victim at White House Tuesday A 20th person was injured at the scene, but not by gunfire. The shooter, Jared Lee Loughner, was detained by bystanders until he was taken into police custody. As the shooting took place at a US government event, and federal employees were attacked, federal offenses were committed. Federal officials charged Loughner on the next day with killing federal government employees, attempting to assassinate a member of Congress, and attempting to kill federal employees. After eventually facing more than 50 federal criminal charges, Loughner pleaded guilty to 19 of them in a plea bargain to avoid a death sentence. Giffords's intern, Daniel Hern√°ndez Jr., provided first-aid assistance to her immediately after she was wounded, and is credited with saving her life. She was quickly evacuated to the University Medical Center of Tucson in critical condition, though she was still conscious and \\"following commands\\" at the time. On the same day doctors performed emergency surgery to extract skull fragments and a small amount of necrotic tissue from her brain. The bullet passed through Giffords's head without crossing the midline of the brain, where the most critical injuries typically result. Part of her skull was removed to avoid further damage to the brain from pressure caused by swelling. Doctors who first treated Giffords said the bullet entered the back of her head and exited through the front of her skull, but physicians later concluded that it had traveled in the opposite direction. Upon receiving a call from a staffer about Giffords's injury, husband Mark Kelly and his daughters flew in a friend's aircraft directly from Houston to Tucson. Recovery Giffords initially was placed in an induced coma to allow her brain to rest. She was able to respond to simple commands when periodically awakened, but was unable to speak as she was on a ventilator. Nancy Pelosi said Giffords's husband Mark Kelly acknowledged that there is a \\"rough road ahead\\" for his wife's recovery, but was encouraged by her responsiveness, which included the ability to signal with her hand and move both arms. U.S. Army neurologist Geoffrey Ling of the Uniformed Services University in Bethesda, Maryland, was sent to Tucson to consult on Giffords's condition. Ling stated, \\"Her prognosis for maintaining the function that she has is very good. It's over 50 percent.\\" On January 11, neurosurgeon G. Michael Lemole Jr. said that Giffords's sedation had been reduced and that she could breathe on her own. On January 12, President Barack Obama visited Giffords at the medical center and publicly stated in an evening memorial ceremony that she had \\"opened her eyes for the first time\\" that day. Shortly after the shootings, some questions were raised by the media as to whether Giffords could be removed from office under a state law that allows a public office to be declared vacant if the officeholder is absent for three months, but a spokesperson for the Arizona secretary of state said the statute \\"doesn't apply to federal offices\\" and was, therefore, not relevant. As Giffords's status improved, by mid-January she began simple physical therapy, including sitting up with the assistance of hospital staff and moving her legs upon command. On January 15, surgeons performed a tracheotomy, replacing the ventilator tube with a smaller one inserted through Giffords's throat to assist independent breathing. Ophthalmologist Lynn Polonski surgically repaired Giffords's damaged eye socket, with additional reconstructive surgery to follow. Giffords's condition improved from \\"critical\\" to \\"serious\\" on January 17, and to \\"good\\" on January 25. She was transferred on January 21 to the Memorial Hermann Medical Center in Houston, Texas, where she subsequently moved to the TIRR Memorial Hermann to undergo a program of physical therapy, occupational therapy and speech therapy. Medical experts' initial assessment in January was that Giffords's recovery could take from several months to more than one year. Upon her arrival in Houston, her doctors were optimistic, saying she has \\"great rehabilitation potential\\". On March 12, 2011, Giffords's husband informed her that six other people had been killed in the attack on her, but he did not identify who they were until months later.Myers, Amanda Lee and Michelle Price. \\"AP Exclusive: Giffords vows return to Congress\\", yahoo.com, Associated Press, November 4, 2011 In late April, Giffords's doctors reported that her physical, cognitive, and language production abilities had improved significantly, placing her in the top 5 percent of patients recovering from similar injuries. She was walking under supervision with perfect control of her left arm and leg, and able to write with her left hand. She was able to read and understand, and spoke in short phrases. With longer efforts, she was able to produce more complex sentences. From early in her recovery, Giffords's husband had expressed confidence that she would be able to travel to the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, to witness the launch of his final Space Shuttle mission, STS-134, which was originally scheduled for April 2011. On April 25, Giffords's doctors gave her medical clearance to travel to Florida for the launch, originally scheduled for April 29. She went to Florida where she was to watch from a private family area, without any public appearance or photography. The launch of STS-134 was delayed due to mechanical problems, and Giffords and Kelly returned to Houston after meeting with President Obama, who had also planned to see the launch with his family at Kennedy Space Center (KSC). After continuing her rehabilitation therapy in Houston, Giffords returned to KSC for her husband's launch on May 16, 2011. Kelly wore his wife's wedding ring into space, which she had exchanged for his. August 1, 2011: Giffords's first appearance in the House of Representatives since her attempted assassination Giffords underwent cranioplasty surgery on May 18, 2011, to replace the part of her skull that had been removed in January to permit her brain to swell after the gunshot to her head. Surgeons replaced the bone with a piece of molded hard plastic, fixed with tiny screws; they expected that her skull would eventually fuse with the plastic's porous material. At that point, Giffords no longer needed to wear the helmet that she had been wearing to protect her brain from further injury.\\"Successful surgery to repair skull\\" . The Washington Post, May 20, 2011. On June 9, 2011, Giffords's aide Pia Carusone announced that while Giffords's comprehension appeared to be \\"close to normal, if not normal\\", she was not yet using complete sentences. On June 12, two photos of Giffords taken on May 17 were released, the first since the shooting. On June 15, Giffords was released from the hospital to return home, where she continued speech, music, physical and occupational therapy.. Having learnt the French horn as a child she returned to the instrument as part of her music therapy and in August 2020 spoke about this experience in a speech endorsing Joe Biden's presidential bid.https://arktimes.com/arkansas-blog/2020/08/19/play-it-again- gabby On August 1, she made her first public appearance on the House floor to vote in favor of raising the debt limit ceiling. She was met with a standing ovation and accolades from her fellow members of Congress. A Giffords spokesman, Mark Kimble, stated in August 2011 that the congresswoman was walking without a cane and was writing left-handed, as she did not have full use of her right side.\\"Gabrielle Giffords Walking, Writing, Aide Says\\". Huffington Post, August 30, 2011 On October 6, Giffords traveled to Washington for her husband's retirement ceremony, where she presented him with the Distinguished Flying Cross medal. She returned to her husband's Texas home.Memoli, Michael A. \\"Gabrielle Giffords praised as 'inspiration' in White House visit\\", Los Angeles Times, October 6, 2011 On October 25, she travelled to Asheville, North Carolina, for intensive rehabilitation treatments, ending November 4.\\"Gabrielle Giffords to undergo 'intensive' therapy in North Carolina\\" , CNN, October 23, 2011 In Kelly's memoir, Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope, released in November 2011, he reported that Giffords would return to Congress. She continues to struggle with language and has lost fifty percent of her vision in both eyes. Resignation from Congress President Obama at the 2012 State of the Union Address On January 22, 2012, Giffords announced in a video statement that she intended to resign her seat so that she could continue to focus on her recovery.\\"Gabrielle Giffords to resign from US Congress\\", CBC, January 22, 2012 She attended President Obama's 2012 State of the Union Address on January 24, and formally submitted her resignation on January 25. Appearing on the floor of the House, after the last bill she sponsored was brought to a vote and unanimously passed, Giffords was lauded by members of Congress and the majority and minority leaders who spoke in tribute to her strength and accomplishment in an unusual farewell ceremony. Her letter of resignation was read on her behalf by her close friend and fellow Democratic representative, Debbie Wasserman Schultz. ==Post-Congress career== Giffords in 2019 On September 6, 2012, Giffords led the Pledge of Allegiance at that evening's meeting of the Democratic National Convention. In January 2013, Giffords still had difficulty speaking and walking, and her right arm was paralyzed. She continued to undergo speech and physical therapy. On January 8, 2014, Giffords marked the third anniversary of the shooting by going skydiving. Giffords said on an interview with the Today show, \\"Oh, wonderful sky. Gorgeous mountain. Blue skies. I like a lot. A lot of fun. Peaceful, so peaceful.\\" After her shooting, Giffords became an advocate for anti-gun-violence causes. In 2017, after the Las Vegas shooting that killed 58 and injured 546, she implored lawmakers to take action, saying she ‚Äúknows the horror of gun violence all too well\\". ==Personal life== Giffords with husband Mark Kelly Giffords married U.S. Navy Captain and NASA astronaut Mark Kelly on November 10, 2007. Kelly was the Space Shuttle's pilot on the STS-108 and STS-121 missions, and was the commander of STS-124 and STS-134. Giffords is a former member of the Arizona regional board of the Anti-Defamation League. After Hurricane Katrina struck in August 2005, Giffords spent time as a volunteer in Houston, Texas, in relief efforts for hurricane victims. She wrote about her experience in the Tucson Citizen. Giffords is an avid reader, and was featured on NPR's Weekend Edition on July 9, 2006, talking about her love of books. She was periodically interviewed in 2007 together with Illinois Republican Peter Roskam on NPR's All Things Considered. The series focused on their experiences as freshman members of the 110th Congress.; ; ; ; ; A joint memoir by Giffords and Kelly, Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope, with co-author Jeffrey Zaslow, was published on November 15, 2011. Giffords and Kelly were interviewed by ABC's Diane Sawyer in their first joint interview since the shooting, which aired on a special edition of 20/20 on November 14, 2011, in conjunction with the book's publication. ==Political positions== Economy Giffords voted against President Bush's Economic Stimulus Act of 2008. Giffords was one of 60 lawmakers who voted against the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 during its first House vote before switching to a yes vote in its second House vote, and she voted for the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. In August 2011, she voted in favor of raising the debt ceiling. Education Giffords argues that Americans are competing on a global level and that this competition starts in the classroom. She is a critic of the No Child Left Behind law, viewing it as an unfunded federal mandate. She supports public schools and their improved efficiency. Energy Giffords strongly supports renewable energy, in particular solar energy, as a top public policy priority. In September 2007, she published a report titled: The Community Solar Energy Initiative, Solar Energy in Southern Arizona, observing that Arizona has enough sunshine to power the entire United States. It reviews current energy usage and discusses how to increase the production of solar electricity. On August 1, 2008, she wrote to congressional leaders regarding tax credits that were set to expire, saying that failure to extend the scheme would be extremely harmful to the renewable energy industry \\"just as it is beginning to take off.\\" Immigration and border security Representative Giffords speaking with a military officer in July 2010 Arizona's 8th Congressional District is one of ten in the country bordering Mexico. Giffords has stated that the Arizona SB 1070 legislation is a \\"clear calling that the federal government needs to do a better job\\" and says that she hopes the legislation acts as a wake-up call to the federal government. However, she stopped short of supporting the law itself, saying that it \\"does nothing to secure our border\\" and that it \\"stands in direct contradiction to our past and, as a result, threatens our future.\\" She also claimed that SB1070 kept Arizona from attracting students and businesses. On August 31, 2010, Giffords praised the arrival of National Guard troops on the border: \\"Arizonans have waited a long time for the deployment of the National Guard in our state. Their arrival represents a renewed national commitment to protecting our border communities from drug cartels and smugglers.\\" Giffords worked to secure passage of the August 2010 bill to fund more Border Patrol agents and surveillance technology for Arizona's border with Mexico. The legislation passed the House of Representatives only to be sent back by the U.S. Senate with reduced funding. Ultimately a $600-million bill was passed and signed into law. The bill was over $100 million less than Giffords fought for, but she said, \\"This funding signals a stronger federal commitment to protect those Americans who live and work near the border.\\" In 2008, Giffords introduced legislation that would have increased the cap on the H-1B visa from 65,000 per year to 130,000 per year. If that were not sufficient, according to her legislation, the cap would have been increased to 180,000 per year. The bill would have allowed, at most, 50% of employees at any given company with at least 50 employees to be H-1B guest workers. Giffords said the bill would help high-tech companies in southern Arizona, some of which rely on H-1B employees. However, Giffords's bill was never voted on by the House of Representatives. Gun control In 2008, before being shot, Giffords opposed Washington D.C. prohibitions on possession of handguns in the home and having usable firearms there, signing an amicus brief with the U.S. Supreme Court to support its overturn. In January 2013, Giffords and her husband Mark Kelly started a political action committee called Americans for Responsible Solutions whose mission is to promote gun-control legislation with elected officials and the general public. The couple supports \\"keeping guns out of the hands of dangerous people like criminals, terrorists, and the mentally ill\\". Other proposals from Giffords and Kelly include limiting the sale of certain magazines, limiting the sale of assault weapons, and stopping gun trafficking. Giffords was a surprise witness at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on gun violence on January 30, 2013. In a halting voice, she called for Congress to pass tougher laws on guns, saying \\"too many children are dying.\\" Giffords is right-handed; her speech therapist had to write out her statement for her since her right arm was paralyzed in the shooting. In 2020 she spoke on the third night of the 2020 Democratic National Convention, urging action on gun control. She worked with a speech therapist for months in preparation for the speech, and also performed \\"America\\" on the French horn, an instrument she had played as a teen, as a symbol of her recovery. == Naming honors == It was announced by Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus, on February 10, 2012, that the next U.S. Navy littoral combat ship would be named . Rep. Giffords, still recovering from injuries sustained in the 2011 assassination attempt, attended the ship's keel-laying ceremony and etched her initials into a plate welded into the ship. USS Gabrielle Giffords was christened at the Austal USA shipyard in Mobile, Alabama, on June 13, 2015. Rep. Giffords attended the christening ceremony, along with Second Lady of the United States Jill Biden, who served as the ship's sponsor. The ship was commissioned on June 12, 2017, at Port of Galveston, Texas. Some commentators have noted that several ships in the U.S. Navy, including , , , , , and were named for prominent politicians who were still alive at the time of the naming. A subsequent Navy report on the naming noted that Secretary Mabus considered honoring Giffords and other victims of the Tucson shooting by naming LCS-10 after the city of Tucson, consistent with current practice of naming littoral combat ships for U.S. cities, but this was not possible because , an active , currently bears the name. ==Electoral historySee also== * Giffords * Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence * List of Jewish members of the United States Congress * List of United States Congress members killed or wounded in office * Women in the United States House of Representatives ==ReferencesExternal links== * official U.S. House website (archive 2011) ** ** * Gabrielle Giffords for U.S. Congress official campaign website * Profile at SourceWatch * Giffords's announcement of her resignation, January 22, 2012 * giffords.org Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence and Giffords PAC * Gabrielle Giffords Video produced by Makers: Women Who Make America * - - Category:1970 births Category:2011 Tucson shooting Category:21st-century American politicians Category:21st-century American non- fiction writers Category:21st-century American women politicians Category:21st-century American women writers Category:American gun control activists Category:American memoirists Category:American people of Lithuanian- Jewish descent Category:American people of Polish-Jewish descent Category:American Reform Jews Category:American shooting survivors Category:American women in business Category:Arizona Democrats Category:Arizona state senators Category:Cornell University College of Architecture, Art, and Planning alumni Category:Democratic Party members of the United States House of Representatives from Arizona Category:Female members of the United States House of Representatives Category:Fulbright Scholars Category:Jewish members of the United States House of Representatives Category:Jewish women politicians Category:John F.

It was also released as a single in the U.S. during August 1966 and peaked at #33 on the Billboard Hot 100. Dylan's recording of \\"Just Like a Woman\\" was not issued as a single in the United Kingdom but the British beat group, Manfred Mann, did release a hit single version of the song in July 1966, which peaked at #10 on the UK Singles Chart. In 2011, Rolling Stone magazine ranked Dylan's version of the song at #232 in their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. ==Writing and recording== In the album notes of his 1985 compilation, Biograph, Dylan claimed that he wrote the lyrics of this song in Kansas City on Thanksgiving Day, November 25, 1965, while on tour.Biograph, 1985, Liner notes & text by Cameron Crowe. However, after listening to the recording session tapes of Dylan at work on this song in the Nashville studio, historian Sean Wilentz has written that Dylan improvised the lyrics in the studio, by singing \\"disconnected lines and semi- gibberish\\". Dylan was initially unsure what the person described in the song does that is just like a woman, rejecting \\"shakes\\", \\"wakes\\", and \\"makes mistakes\\". The improvisational spirit extends to the band attempting, in their fourth take, a \\"weird, double-time version\\", somewhere between Jamaican ska and Bo Diddley. Clinton Heylin has analyzed successive drafts of the song from the so-called Blonde On Blonde papers, papers that Heylin believes were either left behind by Dylan or stolen from his Nashville hotel room. The first draft has a complete first verse, a single couplet from the second verse, and another couplet from the third verse. There is no trace of the chorus of the song. In successive drafts, Dylan added sporadic lines to these verses, without ever writing out the chorus. This leads Heylin to speculate that Dylan was writing the words while Al Kooper played the tune over and over on the piano in the hotel room, and the chorus was a \\"last-minute formulation in the studio\\". Kooper has explained that he would play piano for Dylan in his hotel room, to aid the song-writing process, and then would teach the tunes to the studio musicians at the recording sessions. The master take of \\"Just Like a Woman\\" was produced by Bob Johnston and recorded at Columbia Studios, Nashville, Tennessee on March 8, 1966, during the recording of Blonde on Blonde, Dylan's seventh studio album. The song features a lilting melody, backed by delicately picked nylon-string guitar and piano instrumentation, resulting in arguably the most commercial track on the album. The musicians backing Dylan on the track include Charlie McCoy, Joseph A. Souter Jr., and Wayne Moss on guitar, Henry Strzelecki on bass guitar, Hargus \\"Pig\\" Robbins on piano, Al Kooper on organ and Kenny Buttrey on drums. Although Dylan's regular guitar sideman, Robbie Robertson, was present at the recording session, he did not play on the song. This exploration of female wiles and feminine vulnerability was widely rumored‚Äî\\"not least by her acquaintances among Andy Warhol's Factory retinue\\"‚Äîto be about Edie Sedgwick. The reference to Baby's penchant for \\"fog, amphetamine and pearls\\" suggests Sedgwick or some similar debutante, according to Heylin. \\"Just Like a Woman\\" has also been rumored to have been written about Dylan's relationship with fellow folk singer Joan Baez. In particular, it has been suggested that the lines \\"Please don't let on that you knew me when/I was hungry and it was your world\\" may refer to the early days of their relationship, when Baez was more famous than Dylan. Discussing whether the biographical basis of this song is important, literary critic Christopher Ricks has argued, \\"Everyone can understand the feelings and the relationship described in the song, so why does it matter if Dylan wrote it with one woman in mind?\\" In addition to its appearance on Blonde on Blonde, \\"Just Like a Woman\\" also appears on several Dylan compilations, including Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits, Masterpieces, Biograph, The Best of Bob Dylan, Vol. 1, The Essential Bob Dylan, and Dylan. The \\"Just Like a Woman\\" recording session was released in its entirety on the 18-disc Collector's Edition of The Bootleg Series Vol. 12: The Cutting Edge 1965‚Äì1966 in 2015, with highlights from the outtakes appearing on the 6-disc and 2-disc versions of that album. Live recordings of the song have been included on Before the Flood (recorded February 1974), Bob Dylan at Budokan (recorded March 1978), The Bootleg Series Vol. 4: Bob Dylan Live 1966, The \\"Royal Albert Hall\\" Concert (recorded May 1966), The Bootleg Series Vol. 5: Bob Dylan Live 1975, The Rolling Thunder Revue (recorded November 1975), and the Deluxe Edition of The Bootleg Series Vol. 13: Trouble No More 1979‚Äì1981 (recorded June 1981). In November 2016, all Dylan's recorded live performances of the song from 1966 were released in the boxed set The 1966 Live Recordings, with the May 26, 1966 performance released separately on the album The Real Royal Albert Hall 1966 Concert. In June 2019, five live performances of the song from the 1975 Rolling Thunder Revue tour were released in the box set The Rolling Thunder Revue: The 1975 Live Recordings. Dylan performed the song at George Harrison and Ravi Shankar's Concert for Bangladesh in 1971, and his performance is featured on the Concert for Bangladesh album and film. ==Alleged sexism== The song has been criticized for supposed sexism or misogyny in its lyrics. Alan Rinzler, in his book Bob Dylan: The Illustrated Record, describes the song as \\"a devastating character assassination...the most sardonic, nastiest of all Dylan's putdowns of former lovers.\\" In 1971, New York Times writer Marion Meade wrote that \\"there's no more complete catalogue of sexist slurs,\\" and went on to note that in the song Dylan \\"defines women's natural traits as greed, hypocrisy, whining and hysteria.\\" Dylan biographer Robert Shelton noted that \\"the title is a male platitude that justifiably angers women,\\" although Shelton believed that \\"Dylan is ironically toying with that platitude.\\" Countering allegations of misogyny, music critic Paul Williams, in his book Bob Dylan: Performing Artist, Book One 1960‚Äì1973, pointed out that Dylan sings in an affectionate tone from beginning to end. He further comments on Dylan's singing by saying that \\"there's never a moment in the song, despite the little digs and the confessions of pain, when you can't hear the love in his voice.\\" Williams also contends that a central theme of the song is the power that the woman described in the lyrics has over Dylan, as evidenced by the lines \\"I was hungry and it was your world.\\" Bill Janovitz, in his AllMusic review, has noted that in the context of the song, Dylan \\"seems on the defensive...as if he has been accused of causing the woman's breakdown. But he takes some of the blame as well; he was clearly taken by the woman at first, but apparently matured a little and saw through 'her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls.'\\" Janovitz concludes by noting that \\"It is certainly not misogynist to look at a personal relationship from the point of view of one of those involved, be it man or woman. There is nothing in the text to suggest that Dylan has a disrespect for, much less an irrational hatred of, women in general.\\" Similarly, Christopher Ricks asks, \\"could there ever be any challenging art about men and women where the accusation just didn't arise?\\" Ricks has written that the speaker in the song seems to be referring to a woman who occasionally plays the \\"little girl card\\": \\"Someone who has times when she regresses to being childlike‚Äîwho can't live up to the best part of herself.\\" Moreover, Gill has argued that the key \\"delimitation\\" in the song is not between man and woman, but between woman and girl, so the issue is one \\"of maturity rather than gender\\". ==Cover versions== \\"Just Like a Woman\\" has been covered by a variety of different bands and artists, including Stevie Nicks, Radka Toneff, Roberta Flack, Dixie Carter, Manfred Mann, Nina Simone, the Byrds, Joe Cocker, the Hollies, Van Morrison, Jeff Buckley, Rod Stewart, Counting Crows, Gregg Allman, Hazel O'Connor, Richie Havens, Howard Hewett and Something Corporate. *Gary Burton whose version is on his 1967 album Tennessee Firebird with Kenny Buttrey, Charlie McCoy, and Henry Strzelecki who all played on the original. *Manfred Mann and Jonathan King both released their versions of the song on July 29, 1966.

Branded as 104.9 Virgin Radio, the station airs a Top 40/CHR format. The station also broadcasts a Punjabi language format on a Subsidiary Communications Multiplex Operation frequency. ==History== Early years and EZ Rock The station launched in 1978 playing \\"oldies\\" from offices and studios just north of Edmonton in St. Albert. The original frequency was 1070 kHz with the callsign CKST. In 1988, CKST received approval to move from to 1200 AMDecision CRTC 88-497 and changed callsigns to CHMG the same year. CHMG received approval move from AM to FM in 1994.Decision CRTC 94-436 In 1995, CHMG changed to its current callsign, CFMG. At the same time, the station shifted to an adult contemporary format, branded as EZ Rock. Programmed by longtime broadcaster Tammy Cole, EZ Rock was a station designed to appeal to office work environments. Music was slanted towards female listeners 25‚Äì54 years old. On September 28, 2007, the CRTC approved the sale of CFMG and all Standard Radio assets to Astral Media. CFMG's EZ Rock logo, used from September 2010 to February 2011. Astral changed the logo of the station in September 2010; however, the adult contemporary format is unchanged while continuing to say the decimal point on the station ID. In addition, most of the classic hits were dropped. Virgin Radio (2011-present) Former \\"Virgin\\" logo (2011-2019) On February 4, 2011, the station dropped adult contemporary and flipped to Top 40/CHR as 104.9 Virgin Radio. EZ Rock's last song was The Boys Of Summer by Don Henley, while the first song on \\"Virgin\\" was \\"Firework\\" by Katy Perry. This left Edmonton with no adult contemporary station for 51 days until CKEA-FM dropped adult album alternative for adult contemporary (which has since shifted to adult hits). CFMG, during its final adult contemporary week, did list its CHR adds on Mediabase's Canadian adult contemporary panel. A week after the station flipped formats, the station was delisted from Mediabase's station adds. As of March 2011, CFMG-FM joined CHBN- FM on the Mediabase contemporary hit radio panel. CFMG is the third Virgin Radio station in Canada to have a mainstream top 40 format, the first being at Calgary's CIBK-FM the year before, and in Toronto at CKFM-FM in 2009. Every year for one week, along with sister stations CFBR-FM and CFRN, CFMG-FM presents, Stollery Week, a week long fundraiser for the Stollery Children's Hospital. In past years all three stations had broadcast live for 2 days from the Stollery Children's Hospital. In year one, $300,000 was raised for the Pediatric Oncology Unit; in year two, EZ Rock and her sister stations raised $500,000 for Research. ==Ratings== The last ratings period when CFMG was an adult contemporary station (October/10 - January/11) placed the station at #4 with a 7.4 share. In the first ratings period as Virgin Radio (February - May/11), the station plummeted to #14 and with a 2.6 share.

They vary from place to place, but most ceremonies combine dance, song, rituals and often elaborate body decorations and costumes. The different body paintings indicate the type of ceremony being performed. They play an important role in marriage ceremonies, in the education of Indigenous children, as well as story telling and oral history. The term corroboree is commonly used to refer to Australian Aboriginal dances, although this term has its origins among the people of the Sydney region. In some places, Aboriginal people perform corroborees for tourists. In the latter part of the 20th century the influence of Indigenous Australian dance traditions has been seen with the development of concert dance, with the Aboriginal Centre for the Performing Arts (ACPA) providing training in contemporary dance. The Australian bush dance, which draws on traditions from English, Irish, Scottish and other European dance styles, is also a common community activity. Favourite dances include the Irish C√©ilidh \\"Pride of Erin\\" and the quadrille \\"The Lancers\\". Locally originated dances include the \\"Waves of Bondi\\", the Melbourne Shuffle and New Vogue. The Australian Ballet is the foremost classical ballet company in Australia. It began in 1962 and is today recognised as one of the world's major international ballet companies. It is based in Melbourne and performs works from the classical repertoire as well as contemporary works by major Australian and international choreographers. ==Indigenous Australian dance== Australian Aboriginal dancers in 1981. Traditional Aboriginal Australian dance was closely associated with song and was understood and experienced as making present the reality of the Dreamtime. In some instances, they would imitate the actions of a particular animal in the process of telling a story. For the people in their own country it defined to roles, responsibilities and the place itself. These ritual performances gave them an understanding of themselves in the interplay of social, geographical and environmental forces. The performances were associated with specific places and dance grounds were often sacred places. The body decoration and specific gestures related to kin and other relationships, such as to Dreamtime beings. Some groups hold their dances secret or sacred. Gender is an important factor in some ceremonies with men and women having separate ceremonial traditions, such as the Crane Dance.Encyclopaedia of Aboriginal Australia, Volume 1 pp. 255-7 The term \\"corroboree\\" is commonly used by non- Indigenous Australians to refer to any Aboriginal dance, although this term has its origins among the people of the Sydney region. In some places, Australian Aboriginal people perform corroborees for tourists. For Torres Strait Islander people, singing and dancing is their \\"literature\\" ‚Äì \\"the most important aspect of Torres Strait lifestyle. The Torres Strait Islanders preserve and present their oral history through songs and dances;...the dances act as illustrative material and, of course, the dancer himself [sic] is the storyteller‚Äù (Ephraim Bani, 1979). There are many songs about the weather; others about the myths and legends; life in the sea and totemic gods; and about important events. \\"The dancing and its movements express the songs and acts as the illustrative material\\". In the latter part of the 20th century, the influence of Indigenous Australian dance traditions has been seen with the development of concert dance, particularly in contemporary dance with the National Aboriginal Islander Skills Development Association and the Aboriginal Centre for the Performing Arts (ACPA) providing training to Indigenous Australians in dance and the Bangarra Dance Theatre. ==Other varieties of dance== Sir Robert Helpmann. Bush dance has developed in Australia as a form of traditional dance, it draws on traditions from English, Irish, Scottish and other European dance. Favourite dances in the community include dances of European descent, such as the Irish C√©ilidh \\"Pride of Erin\\" and the quadrille \\"The Lancers\\". Locally originated dances include the \\"Waves of Bondi\\", the Melbourne Shuffle and New Vogue. Many immigrant communities continue their own dance traditions on a professional or amateur basis. Traditional dances from a large number of ethnic backgrounds are danced in Australia, helped by the presence of enthusiastic immigrants and their Australian-born families. It is quite common to see dances from the Baltic region, as well as Scottish, Irish, Indian, Indonesian or African dance being taught at community centres and dance schools in Australia. Still more dance groups in Australia employ dances from a variety of backgrounds, including reconstructed European Court dances and Medieval Dance, as well as fusions of traditional steps with modern music and style. The Australian Ballet is the foremost classical ballet company in Australia. Its inaugural artistic director was the English-born dancer, teacher and repetiteur Dame Peggy van Praagh in 1962 and is today recognised as one of the world's major international ballet companies. It is based in Melbourne and performs works from the classical repertoire as well as contemporary works by major Australian and international choreographers. As of 2010, it was presenting approximately 200 performances in cities and regional areas around Australia each year as well as international tours. Regular venues include: the Melbourne Arts Centre, Sydney Opera House, Sydney Theatre, Adelaide Festival Centre and Queensland Performing Arts Centre. Robert Helpmann is among Australia's best known ballerinos. Baz Luhrmann's popular 1992 film Strictly Ballroom, starring Paul Mercurio contributed to an increased interest in dance competition in Australia, and popular dance shows including So You Think You Can Dance have featured on television in recent years. == Nutbush City limits == The Nutbush city limits or as it is most often referred to as the Nutbush.

She played a newspaper reporter working with the team. Introduced in season 2 episode 15 \\"The Battle of Bel-Air\\", the character was brought in as a replacement for Melinda Culea (Amy Allen), who was abruptly dropped from the series after insisting on being given more to do. In order to be written out of the series the character was married off in the season 3 two-part episode 2/3 \\"The Bend in the River\\". Her character from The A-Team, Tawnia Baker, was named after Tawnia Cannell, the daughter of the creator of the series, Stephen J. Cannell. Some time prior to being cast as Tawnia Baker, Heasley made a guest appearance as a bikini clad co-ed called Cherise in a short-term relationship with Templeton \\"Faceman\\" Peck in season 2 episode 4 \\"Bad Time On The Border\\". ==Other roles== Prior to the A-Team, Heasley appeared in the very first four episodes of Star Search in the Spokesmodel category. Heasley has made guest appearances on many other TV shows such as, T. J. Hooker, The Love Boat, Riptide, Mike Hammer, The Highwayman, and many more. She played an unnamed Air Force Lieutenant in the Galactica 1980 episode \\"Spaceball\\". Heasley's feature film roles were The Marrying Man in 1991, and Born to Race in 1987 and Amore! in 1993. ==Biography== Marla grew up in Beverly Hills and went to Beverly Hills Catholic School until the age of 12, when her parents moved the family to Palm Springs. Her father Jack Heasley and uncle Bob Heasley were identical twins and professional ice skaters, known as The Heasley Twins. They skated with Sonia Henie and Dorothy Lewis and skated in their own ice revues as well. They appeared in many films, such as Dr. Seuss's The 5000 Fingers of Dr. T (1953), Ice Capades (1941), Thin Ice (1937), A Chump at Oxford (1940) and many more. They went on to become successful entertainment managers, managing the careers of Audie Murphy, Shelley Winters & more. Marla never wanted to go into acting, as she was raised in the entertainment business. Marla wanted to go into fashion merchandising, but was modeling on the side while attending Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa. Her father introduced her to Norman Brokaw of William Morris Agency as a conduit for her to do commercials. She met an acting coach, Zina Provendie, while on a commercial audition, who invited Marla to audit her class. She attended the class & fell in love with acting & sooner signed with Norman at William Morris. Even though Marla had never acted, Brokaw said that he had a feeling about her. Norman waited to send Marla out on auditions till she was ready. Marla took her studying seriously by attending acting classes vigorously, joined a repertory theater & moved to New York for a year to study with an acting coach. She started working in commercials & then her first television role was in \\"Can You Hear the Laughter? The Freddie Prinze Story\\". She appeared in many guest starring roles, including, \\"Gallactica 1980\\", \\"Micky Spillane's Mike Hammer\\", \\"TJ Hooker\\", \\"The Love Boat\\" & more, before becoming a series regular on \\"The A-Team\\". Marla dated & lived with Wayne Newton from 1983 to 1991 & they were engaged from 1987 to 1991.

MIC depends on the microorganism, the affected human being (in vivo only), and the antibiotic itself. It is often expressed in micrograms per milliliter (Œºg/ml) or milligrams per liter (mg/L). The MIC is determined by preparing solutions of the chemical in vitro at increasing concentrations, incubating the solutions with separate batches of cultured bacteria, and measuring the results using agar dilution or broth microdilution. Results have been graded into susceptible (often called sensitive), intermediate, or resistant to a particular antimicrobial by using a breakpoint. Breakpoints are agreed upon values, published in guidelines of a reference body, such as the U.S. Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI), the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (BSAC) or the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST). There have been major discrepancies between the breakpoints from various European countries over the years, and between those from the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) and the US Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). While MIC is the lowest concentration of an antibacterial agent necessary to inhibit visible growth, minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) is the minimum concentration of an antibacterial agent that results in bacterial death. The closer the MIC is to the MBC, the more bactericidal the compound. The first step in drug discovery is often the screening of a library drug candidate for MICs against bacteria of interest. As such, MICs are usually the starting point for larger pre- clinical evaluations of novel antimicrobial agents. The purpose of measuring the minimum inhibitory concentration is to ensure that antibiotics are chosen efficiently to increase the success of treatment. == Background ==  History  After the discovery and commercialization of antibiotics, microbiologist, pharmacologist, and physician Alexander Fleming developed the broth dilution technique using the turbidity of the broth for assessment. This is commonly believed to be the conception point of minimum inhibitory concentrations. Later in the 1980s, Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute has consolidated the methods and standards for MIC determination and clinical usage. Following the discovery of new antibacterials, pathogens and their evolution, the protocols by CLSI are also continually updated to reflect that change. The protocols and parameters set by CLSI are considered to be the \\"gold standard\\" in the United States and are used by regulatory authorities, such as the FDA, to make evaluations.  Clinical usage  Nowadays, the MIC is used in antimicrobial susceptibility testing. The MIC is reported by providing the susceptibility interpretation next to each antibiotic. The different susceptibility interpretations are: S (Sensitive), I (Intermediate), and R (Resistant). These interpretations were created and implemented by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). In clinics, more often than not, exact pathogens cannot be easily determined by symptoms of the patient. Then, even if the pathogen is determined, different serotypes of pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus, have varying levels of resistance to antimicrobials. As such, it is difficult to prescribe correct antimicrobials. The MIC is determined in such cases by growing the pathogen isolate from the patient on plate or broth, which is later used in the assay. Thus, knowledge of the MIC will provide a physician valuable information for making a prescription. Accurate and precise usage of antimicrobials is also important in the context of multi-drug resistant bacteria. Microbes such as bacteria have been gaining resistance to antimicrobials they were previously susceptible to. Usage of incompatible levels of antimicrobials provides the selective pressure that has driven the direction and evolution of resistance of bacterial pathogens. This has been seen at sub-MIC levels of antibiotics. As such, it is increasingly important to determine the MIC in order to make the best choice in prescribing antimicrobials. MIC is used clinically over MBC because MIC is more easily determined. Minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), which is the minimum antibacterial concentration resulting in microbial death, is defined by the inability to re-culture bacteria. In addition, drug effectiveness is generally similar when taken at both MIC and MBC concentrations because the host immune system can expel the pathogen when bacterial proliferation is at a standstill. When the MBC is much higher than the MIC, drug toxicity makes taking the MBC of the drug detrimental to patient. Antimicrobial toxicity can come in many forms, such as immune hypersensitivity and off-target toxicity. == Methods ==  Broth dilution assay  Broth Dilution Assay. The MIC is determined by evaluation of turbidity of tubes with constantly increasing concentration of antimicrobial agent.There are three main reagents necessary to run this assay: the media, an antimicrobial agent, and the microbe being tested. The most commonly used media is cation-adjusted Mueller Hinton Broth, due to its ability to support the growth of most pathogens and its lack of inhibitors towards common antibiotics. Depending on the pathogen and antibiotics being tested, the media can be changed and/or adjusted. The antimicrobial concentration is adjusted into the correct concentration by mixing stock antimicrobial with media. The adjusted antimicrobial is serially diluted into multiple tubes (or wells) to obtain a gradient. The dilution rate can be adjusted depending on the breakpoint and the practitioner's needs. The microbe, or the inoculating agent, must come from the same colony-forming unit, and must be at the correct concentration. This may be adjusted by incubation time and dilution. For verification, the positive control is plated in a hundred fold dilution to count colony forming units. The microbes inoculate the tubes (or plate) and are incubated for 16‚Äì20 hours. The MIC is generally determined by turbidity.  Etest  Etest. After the required incubation period, when an even lawn of growth is distinctly visible, the MIC value is read where the pointed end of the inhibition ellipse intersects the side of the strip. Etests can also be used as an alternative method to determine minimal inhibitory concentration values of a wide range of antimicrobial agents against different organism groups which has been widely used in microbiology laboratories around the world. Manufactured by bioM√©rieux, Etests are a ready-to-use, non-porous plastic reagent strip with a predefined gradient of antibiotic, covering a continuous concentration range. == See also == *Kirby‚ÄìBauer test == References == Category:Microbiology terms ","title":"Minimum inhibitory concentration"},{"id":"5600473","text":"Eugene Belden ‚ÄúGene‚Äù Galusha (August 20, 1941 ‚Äì August 6, 2008) was a Jewish- American part-time actor and full-time narrator who has worked for PBS, ESPN, Court TV, Discovery Channel, A&E;, ABC, The Learning Channel and NFL Films. ==Filmography== As actor * Stephanie Daley (as Mr. Gilchrist) (2006) * The West Wing * Particular Men (1972).

His father, Ludwig, a painter of some note, gave him his first art lessons. In 1825, he went to Munich, where he was accepted at the Academy of Fine Arts and studied with Peter von Cornelius. Soon, he was allowed to assist Cornelius with his frescoes at the Glyptothek and the Hofgarten. Later, he assisted Wilhelm Lindenschmit the Elder at the new Royal Palace, creating murals based on the ballads of Friedrich Schiller. At this time, he also began to create a series of oil paintings on historical subjects; notably one of King Otto saying farewell on his way to Greece. In 1835, he took a study trip to Rome, where he created his monumental painting \\"Des S√§ngers Fluch\\" (The Singer's Curse), based on the poem by Ludwig Uhland. Upon his return, he was appointed a Professor at the Academy by King Maximilian II of Bavaria. In thanks, he created two monumental canvases for the Maximilianeum. Between 1865 and 1875, he served as Director of the Royal Gallery, but was harshly criticized for his methods of restoration, which employed questionable chemical processes developed by Max von Pettenkofer, as well as the overpainting of some canvases. Despite this, he was elevated to the nobility in 1869. His paintings are historically precise, but are now considered to be rather conservative and academic.

The film features Rodrigo Noya as Valent√≠n and Carmen Maura as the grandmother. Director Alejandro Agresti also stars as Valent√≠n's father. The story revolves around the world of an eight-year-old boy, Valent√≠n (Noya), who dreams of one day becoming an astronaut. While caught in the middle of his family, he attempts to better the bewildering world around him. == Plot == The story takes place in 1969 and is told through the eyes of Valent√≠n, an eight-year-old small, cross-eyed boy (Noya) whose thick black- rimmed glasses sit heavily on his face. He lives with his grandmother (Maura) due to the divorce of his parents. He dreams of being an astronaut one day and intently follows the ongoing space race between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. He no longer sees his Jewish mother, who was chased out of the family home by his imperious, dictator-like father (Agresti). He misses her badly but hardly remembers her. His anti-Semitic father only occasionally visits to his mother and son, preferring to live the life of an Argentine playboy. Valent√≠n is friends with his uncle Chiche (Jean Pierre Noher) and the piano teacher Rufo who lives across the street (Mex Urtizberea). Both talk to Valent√≠n as if he were an adult, and it seems Valent√≠n is wise beyond his years. His uncle takes him to mass and where a priest (Fabi√°n Vena) talks about the death of an Argentinian doctor who was killed recently. He talks about Che Guevara as a man \\"who believed in an ideal, and who believed that injustice could be overcome. Please, don't leave here before you've asked yourselves, in all sincerity: Who of you would give, not his whole life, but a year or even just one day, for an ideal, the way that Che gave all he had?\\". Many in the audience walk out and Valent√≠n comments: \\"But just like my uncle said, the priest couldn't change anything. Everything stayed the same\\". Leticia (Julieta Cardinali), his father's latest romantic interest, pays a visit and both she and Valentin spend the day together going to the park, seeing a movie and sharing a meal. Valent√≠n tells her personal things about his life and father. Due to Valent√≠n's tales about his family, Leticia rethinks her relationship with his father and breaks up with him. His father is quite upset and blames Valent√≠n. One day Valent√≠n realizes that his grandmother is ill but refuses to see a doctor. Valent√≠n makes plans on how to get her to see Dr. Galaburri (Carlos Roff√©). The plan he cooks up seems to work and she makes certain lifestyle changes. To thank the doctor, Valent√≠n is thoughtful and buys a painting for Dr. Galaburri to display in his office. However, one day his grandmother passes away when she goes to the hospital and Valentin comes to stay with one of his friends from school. One day a thoughtful man visits Valent√≠n and gives him a shirt that his mother sent for him. They have a conversation about his mother and Valent√≠n begins to understand why his mother has stayed away for such a long time. The film ends as he sets up a blind date between Leticia and his piano teacher Rufo. They all have a meal together and Valent√≠n tells us he decided to become a writer and that Leticia and Rufo lived happily ever after. == Cast == * Rodrigo Noya as Valent√≠n * Carmen Maura as Grandmother * Julieta Cardinali as Leticia * Jean Pierre Noher as Uncle Chiche * Mex Urtizberea as Rufo, the piano teacher * Lorenzo Quinteros as a barman * Alejandro Agresti as Father * Carlos Roff√© as Dr. Galaburri == Development == In the DVD interview with director Alejandro Agresti, he said the film was based on one year of his childhood. Furthermore, Agresti stated he was motivated by what he perceived as the nature of kids. He made the case that kids have an ability to deal with life's difficulties and have a natural inclination to overcome obstacles out of sheer love and necessity, and not out of pride and fear. == Reception == Valent√≠n garnered mostly mixed reviews from film critics. On review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an overall 61% \\"Fresh\\" approval rating based on 66 reviews, with a rating average of 6.1 out of 10. The site's consensus is: \\"A coming-of-age tale that's more cloying than affecting.\\" At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 0‚Äì100 reviews from film critics, the film has a rating score of 52 based on 29 reviews, classified as a mixed or average reviewed film. Film critic Roger Ebert lauded the film and casting of the young boy as Valent√≠n, writing, \\"I am not always sure what I mean when I praise a child actor, especially one as young as Rodrigo Noya. Certainly casting has a lot to do with his appeal; he looks the part and exudes a touching solemnity. But there is more. There's something about this kid, and the way he talks and listens and watches people, that is very convincing. Perhaps it helped that he was directed by a man who was once Valentin himself. The film is warm and intriguing, and he is the engine that pulls us through it. We care about what happens to him; high praise.\\"Ebert, Roger. Chicago Sun-Times, film review, May 21, 2004. Last accessed: January 23, 2008. Critics Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat of the website Spirituality & Practice liked the film and wrote, \\"Written and directed by Alejandro Agresti, this remarkable drama takes us right into the yearning heart of a very smart and lonely young boy...The hopeful finale gives Valentin an opportunity to play matchmaker, something he finds much to his liking. This tender and heart-warming Argentinian film is a winner!\\"Brussat, Frederic and Mary Ann. Spirituality & Practice, film reviews, 2004. Last accessed: January 24, 2008. The New York Times's Dave Kehr seems to like the film (he says nothing negative about it) but does make the case that the director panders to the audience a bit. He wrote, \\"[The film] has become all too familiar in the art houses: the cute child who awakens the cranky grown-ups around him to the infinite possibilities of life...[it] neglects few opportunities to pander to its public...[and] soon enough the bouncy pop score takes over again, and Valent√≠n returns to its true business, tugging at well- worn heart strings.\\"Kehr, Dave. The New York Times, film review, May 7, 2004. Last accessed: December 18, 2007. == Distribution == The producers used the following tagline to market the film: :Cupid just turned eight.

In Cain, Byron dramatizes the story of Cain and Abel from Cain's point of view. Cain is an example of the literary genre known as closet drama. ==Characters== *Adam *Eve *Cain, their first son *Abel, their second son *Adah, Cain's sister and wife *Zillah, Abel's sister and wife *Lucifer *Angel of the Lord ==Summary== The play commences with Cain refusing to participate in his family's prayer of thanksgiving to God. Cain tells his father he has nothing to thank God for because he is fated to die. As Cain explains in an early soliloquy, he regards his mortality as an unjust punishment for Adam and Eve's transgression in the Garden of Eden, an event detailed in the Book of Genesis. Cain's anxiety over his mortality is heightened by the fact that he does not know what death is. At one point in Act I, he recalls keeping watch at night for the arrival of death, which he imagines to be an anthropomorphic entity. The character who supplies Cain with knowledge of death is Lucifer. In Act II, Lucifer leads Cain on a voyage to the \\"Abyss of Space\\" and shows him a catastrophic vision of the Earth's natural history, complete with spirits of extinct life forms like the mammoth. Cain returns to Earth in Act III, depressed by this vision of universal death. At the climax of the play, Cain murders Abel. The play concludes with Cain's banishment. ==Literary influences== Perhaps the most important literary influence on Cain was John Milton's epic poem Paradise Lost, which tells of the creation and fall of mankind. For Byron as for many Romantic poets, the hero of Paradise Lost was Satan, and Cain is modelled in part on Milton's defiant protagonist. Furthermore, Cain's vision of the Earth's natural history in Act II is a parody of Adam's consolatory vision of the history of man (culminating in the coming and sacrifice of Christ) presented by the Archangel Michael in Books XI and XII of Milton's epic. In the preface to Cain, Byron attempts to downplay the influence of poems \\"upon similar topics\\", but the way he refers to Paradise Lost suggests its formative influence: \\"Since I was twenty, I have never read Milton; but I had read him so frequently before, that this may make little difference.\\"Byron, \\"Preface\\" to Cain, in The Major Works, ed. Jerome J. McGann (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1986), p. 865. ==Other influences== As Byron himself notes in the preface to Cain, Cain's vision in Act II was inspired by the theory of catastrophism. In an attempt to explain large gaps in the fossil record, catastrophists posited that the history of the Earth was punctuated with violent upheavals that had destroyed its flora and fauna. Byron read about catastrophism in an 1813 English translation of some early work by French natural historian Georges Cuvier. Other influences include The Divine Legation of Moses by William Warburton and A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful by Edmund Burke. ==NotesReferences== *Byron, The Major Works, ed.

All a user needs to do to take advantage of these savings is to dial the call- through access number followed by the destination number. Different phone companies specializes in a different types of international phone call deals, which means that the cheap long-distance call plan that works for one country won't necessarily work for another. Most call-through telecom companies charge different telephone call prices at different times of day for local and national calls while others offer really cheap international phone calls (from as little as 0.5p or 1p per minute in the UK, as a local call rate for the international phone call in Ireland and France, 2c a minute, even free, in Austria and Germany etc.). These call-through telecom companies require no signup or account; they don't require a credit card, and users do not need to change their phone provider, purchase any special devices or even buy a phone card. Call-through companies frequently update their rates, thereby making it imperative for users to get a view on rates across the market before calling. ==Technology== Call-through telecom providers use Voice over IP (VoIP) call termination to connect the caller to the recipient. Most of the call is carried over IP network, where cost of carrying of the audio signal is cheaper than traditional phone carriers. The calls that are initiated on the Internet (e.g. Skype) use VoIP. These calls can terminate at other point on Internet or even at the point, which is not on the Internet, e.g. traditional telephone line - this is known as call termination. The calls do not have to originate on Internet in order to use VoIP. A caller can dial a physical phone number, which is then routed over VoIP to the point when it is terminated at the recipient's physical phone line (fixed landline or wireless mobile or cell line), even in another country. This is what call-through telecom operators do - they provide call termination at both ends of the call. ==Austria== There are several cheap call-through numbers in Austria, for example toolani. ==Germany== Quite a lot of call-through companies are active in the German market, typically offering their services via 0180 Shared Cost Service numbers charged at 0.039 ‚Ç¨ to 0.14 ‚Ç¨ per minute from German landlines, and up to 0.42 ‚Ç¨ per minute from German mobile phones. ==UK== In the UK, most call-through access services use non-geographic revenue share 0843, 0844, 0871 and 0872 numbers or premium rate 0905, 0906 and 0911 numbers. The revenue share or \\"service charge\\" part of the price paid is set by the terminating telecoms company. This in turn depends on the exact number dialled. The lowest rates are on 084 numbers, higher on 087 numbers and the highest rates are on 09 numbers. In a small number of cases, the \\"service charge\\" may vary based on the time of the day. Prices also vary according to the \\"access charge\\" added by the originating telecoms company. Additionally, the access charge levied on a call from a mobile telephone will be a lot more than from a landline. ==External links== United Kingdom of Great Britain *Cheap international calls from UK compared *Comparison of international call providers from UK Category:Telecommunications companies ","title":"Call-through telecom"},{"id":"5600578","text":"The simple station Tober√≠n is part of the TransMilenio mass-transit system of Bogot√°, Colombia, which opened in the year 2000. { class=\\"infobox\\" style=\\"width: 25em; font-size: 90%;\\" - colspan=\\"3\\" bgcolor=\\"#FF0000\\"  center; font-size: larger;\\"  Tober√≠n - colspan=2 { width=100% style=\\"background: #f9f9f9;\\" - style=\\"vertical-align: center; text-align: center;\\" width=40%Portal del Norte width=20%‚óÑ Troncal Autonorte ‚ñ∫ width=40%Calle 161 } - Location Autopista Norte with Calle 165 - Neighborhood Usaqu√©n and Suba - Opened 2001 } ==Location== The station is located in northern Bogot√°, specifically on Autopista Norte with calle 165.

She intended her productions to follow the performance \\"traditions\\" of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, and she replicated \\"authentic\\" costumes as closely as possible. Raedler's intentions, as stated in the company's program notes, were to avoid \\"pork pie\\" gags or cheap laughs, to stay true to Gilbert's stylistic intentions and to give each member of her company intensive training in the art. Raedler also decided that her company would use American stage diction, rather than British, and attractive actors, to cater to her audiences. Like Gilbert, Raedler was known as a hard taskmaster in rehearsals and an exacting director. For this first tour, Raedler renamed the company American Savoyards. The first shows on tour were The Mikado and Patience. Early tours included U.S. states from Florida to Maine. Subsequent tours included places as far away as California and Canada. Each winter, the company returned to New York City, often performing at the Jan Hus Playhouse on East 74th Street, the downstairs room in a church. The group claimed to be the only professional theatre company performing the full G&S; repertoire, as the D'Oyly Carte had retired several productions. In 1953, the American Savoyards performed for ten weeks over the summer in Cumston Hall, a Victorian theater in Monmouth, Maine.\\"Cumston Hall Is Gilbert & Sullivan Summer Festival Center\\", Lewiston Evening Journal, July 11, 1953, pp. 7A‚Äì8A, accessed December 24, 2014 They returned each summer for seven years to Monmouth, generally for ten-week seasons. Their format was eight performances of a different G&S; show each week (6 evenings, 2 matinees, no Sunday performances).\\"American Savoyards to Feature Several New Cast Members\\", Lewiston Evening Journal, May 25, 1957, p. 3 In 1956, Ronald Bush, the company's principal bass-baritone, gave up his on-stage roles to become its music director.\\"Bush is Music Director for American Savoyards\\", Lewiston Evening Journal, June 16, 1956, p. 3 The same year, Company first performed Utopia Limited, probably the first professional performances of this work in North America since 1894. In 1957, Raymond Allen took over the comic leads when the Knapps left the company. In 1958, the company added three non-G&S; operettas, and in 1959 they added The Grand Duke, in its North American professional premiere. That summer, the company performed four other G&S; shows and five non-G&S; shows in Monmouth. It was the company's last summer in Maine.Theatre World, vols. 16 (1960) and 22 (1966), Theatre World MediaDeOrsey, Stan.

Pinafore The company continued performing in New York (including at the Jan Hus, Shakespearewrights Theatre, Greenwich Mews, Actor's Playhouse, Brooklyn Academy of Music and other venues) and toured elsewhere in the United States. By 1965, the company was having financial difficulties, and Raedler was ultimately unable to hold it together. Its final performance was on December 31, 1967, at the Jan Hus theatre. Not long after the company closed, a new professional Gilbert and Sullivan company grew up in residence at the Jan Hus, the Light Opera of Manhattan (LOOM). The company's then principal comic, Raymond Allen, joined LOOM, and Raedler sold many of the company's costumes and stage properties to the new company.Moore (1962); Raedler introduction ==Production details== The company's accompaniment consisted of a piano and Hammond organ, although occasionally it performed with the full Sullivan orchestra on tour. Musical director Ronald Bush generally conducted from the organ. All of the productions were directed and choreographed by Raedler. The principal actors were mostly members of Actors' Equity Association, and the company often used young local talent in the chorus. The company performed long seasons. The actors included Sally Knapp (later a Broadway and television commercial actress) as the company's first principal soprano, and her brother, Rue Knapp, in the comic baritone roles. Ronald Bush sang the bass-baritone roles with the company until the mid-1950s, when he became musical director. Other company members included Charles Nelson Reilly, Dominic Chianese (later \\"Uncle Junior\\" in The Sopranos), Bill Tost (later the long-time \\"Bellomy\\" in The Fantasticks); Bob Randall (the novelist, who wrote the comedy, 6 Rms Riv Vu), Ellen ShadeThe Yeomen of the Guard , at the Lortel Archives, accessed March 3, 2013 and Robert Schmorr (opera singers who later appeared at the Metropolitan Opera), Arthur Mathews (who later appeared on Broadway), opera singer and director Don Yule, James Stuart (who founded the Ohio Light Opera), Allan Lokos (Broadway actorAllan Lokos, IBDB database and now a minister). Raymond Allen, later with LOOM and New York City Opera, began with tenor roles and replaced Knapp in the comic \\"patter\\" roles in 1957.Raymond Allen obituary in The New York Times, February 3, 1994, accessed May 19, 2009 ==Dorothy Raedler== Dorothy Raedler was born February 24, 1917, in New York City. She attended Hunter College. In addition to her Gilbert and Sullivan companies, she directed non-G&S; operas in various venues, including several at New York City Opera, Baltimore Civic Opera Company and elsewhere from the 1960s.Kozinn, Allan. \\"Dorothy Raedler, Stage Director, 76; Noted for Operetta\\", The New York Times, December 18, 1993, p. 24 The New York Times wrote: \\"Pl√°cido Domingo, a new tenor, was Pinkerton. ...

He became the first recorded European to permanently settle in North Carolina in 1655. He often appears as Captain Nathaniel Batts in the records of Norfolk County, Virginia, where his wife owned land by her prior husband, Henry Woodhouse. == Resident of Nansemond County, Virginia == Nathaniel owned 900 acres in Nansemond County, Virginia. County records for Nansemond have been destroyed, but an October 20, 1665 land grant to the orphans of Thomas Francis, deceased, recite that Thomas Francis had purchased 900 acres from Nathaniel Batts. The parcel had been \\"granted to Samuel Stephens on 20 July 1639, the patent being then for 2,000 acres, but upon strict survey found to contain the quantity aforesaid; by Stephens sould [sold] unto Nathaniell Batts, who sould [sold] to sd. Francis [Thomas Francis].\\"Virginia Land Grants, State of Virginia Archives Samuel Stephens (from whom Nathaniel Batts bought the 900 acre parcel), was Governor of North Carolina from 1667 until his death in 1669 and had married Frances Culpepper. Thomas Francis (to whom Nathaniel Batts sold the 900 acre parcel) was presumably the same Thomas Francis that with Thomas Dew, were in 1656 commissioned by the General Assembly of Virginia to \\"make discoveries between Cape Hatteras and Cape Fear.\\" == Early Landowner in North Carolina - 1660 Deed == Nathaniel Batts' deed from King Kiscutanewh for \\"ye land which Mr. Mason & Mr. Willoughby formerly bought of mee but never paid me for, to Mr. Nathaniel Batts for a valuable consideration in hand received, all ye Land on ye southwest side of Pascotanck River from ye mouth of ye sd. River to ye head of new Begin Creek\\" was witnessed by George Durant and Richard Batts in September 1660. The deed was recorded in Norfolk County, Virginia, but was for land located in present-day North Carolina. Nathaniel presumably was living on this land on July 11, 1662, as indicated by a Northampton County, Virginia record binding \\"John Vines, Robert Foster, William Foster & Richard Stevens, Joyntly & Severally our Joynt or Several Heirs, Executors or Administrators to pay or cause to be paid to Nathaniel Batts Gent his heirs, Executors, Administrators or Assigns twelve good Cows under nine years old a piece to be delivered in ‚Äúpascotanch River‚Äù [Pascotanck River in North Carolina] at ye house of ye said Nathaniel Batts Gent,\\" which record was witnessed by Richard Foster and Samuel Pricklove.Northampton County, Virginia Court Records On August 2, 1662, Nathaniel Batts Gent. assigned over to John Curtis all his right and title in this bill, which assignment was witnessed by John Stringer and William Waters. Samuel Pricklove, witness of the bill, was evidently another early settler in the Roanoke region as evidenced by the March 1, 1661 deed of George Durant, which was recorded in Perquimans County. This is the first surviving [transcription of a] deed in North Carolina and it states that the land was \\"adjacent land formerly sold to Samuel Pricklove.\\" Approximately around the time of the preceding bill, on January 28, 1662 (this may have been 1663), \\"John Curtis of Northampton County in Virginia, Merchant, do acquitt & release Robert Foster of his part of a Bond that he was engaged to Nathaniel Batts Gent. for Land that was bought of ye said Batts and ye said Curtis do discharged ye said Foster for any claim of ye said Batts or any other person or persons that may lay any Claim.\\" There is no further record of what \\"Land\\" this refers to or to where this land was located. == Explorations to the Southward of Virginia / \\"Batts House\\" on 1657 Map == On May 8, 1654, a letter describing discoveries to the south of Virginia was written by Coll. Francis Yeardley (second son of George Yeardley) to John Farrar, Esq., wherein are numerous mentions of a ‚Äúyoung man, a trader for beavers\\" who is referenced alternatively as ‚Äúthe young man the interpreter‚Äù or \\"interpreter,\\" though the letter does not name Nathaniel by name.The Ferrar papers, 1590-1790, in Magdalene College, Cambridge. Nathaniel Batts and Coll. Francis Yeardley are found in records together in Maryland in 1653/54; they did not live there and are noted as \\"of Virginia\\". The Court and Testamentary Business, 1653/4, in Maryland show that \\"Cornelius Saunders, Carpenter, did sell Nathaniel Batts, Coll. Yardley's Interpreter, a parcel of sugar amounting by Agreement unto 19‚Äô & of Beaver as by his Note to Richard Foster doth appear.\\" A number of other records during this same time period in Maryland show that Francis Yeardley and Nathaniel Batts were working in partnership with one another, including one where Yeardley and Batts seized a vessel in Potomac River \\"because she came lately from trading at the Dutch plantations\\". The court found they could not show \\"lawful warrant\\" for seizing the vessel; Yeardley was fined 3,000 lbs of tobacco and cask and Batts was fined 1,000 lbs. In 1655, a small house was built for Nathaniel Batts at Yeardley's expense and is depicted as \\"Batts House\\" on a manuscript map of \\"The South Part of Virginia\\" drawn in 1657 by a London cartographer, Nicholas Comberford. A carpenter, Robert Bodnam, sometime before the middle of July 1655, was sent \\"twice to the Southward\\" where he remained for a total of five months \\"ffor building a house for Batts to live in and trade with the Indians wch I did doe by Coll. Yeardley's Appointment and he did promise to see me paid for it.\\" Surviving records of the case in Norfolk County show that the house was twenty feet square with two rooms and a chimney, for which Bodnam was awarded \\"One Thousand weight of Tobb and Caske\\" by the court.\\" The Francis Yeardley letter of 1654 describes that \\"In September last, a young man, a trader for beavers, being bound out to the adjacent parts to trade, by accident his sloop left him; and he, supposing she had gone to Rhoanoke, hired a small boat, and, with one of his company left with him, came to crave my license to go to look after his sloop, and sought some relief of provisions of me; the which granting he set forth with three more in company, one being of my family, the others were my neighbors...\\" In the letter, Yeardley refers to the voyage as \\"an ample discovery of South Virginia or Carolina.\\" At a Quarter Court held at James City on June 11, 1657 and recorded August 17, 1657 in the Minutes of Quarter Court of Virginia, ‚ÄúThe court taking into consideration ye great paines & trouble which Mr. Nathaniell Batts hath taken in the discovery of an Inlett to the Southward, which is likely to be mutch advantagious to the Inhabitants of this Collony; have therefore ordered that ye said Batts be hereby protected from all his creditors within this Country for one year & a day, without any trouble or molestacon upon consideration that the said Batts shall always be ready upon ye Courteous service, & to petition to the next Assembly for Confirmation hereof.

Abraham Wood and Captain Francis Willis.H. R. McIlwaine, Minutes of the Council and General Court of Colonial Virginia, 1670-1676, with notes and excerpts from Original Council and General Court Records, Into 1683 Now Lost (Richmond: Virginia State Library, 1924), 52, 54, 55, 58, 59. == Interactions with the Indians to the Southward of Virginia == The house built in 1655 at Francis Yeardley's expense was \\"for Batts to live in and trade with the Indians\\". Circa 1655/56, Norfolk County, Virginia records show that prior orders restraining Nathaniel from trading with the Indians were reversed, \\"It is ordered that a former order granted against Nathaniel Batts by ye Comrs of ye Melitia restraining ye sd Batts from goeing unto or trading wth the Indians be reversed & disaanulled\\". The last appearance of Nathaniel Batts in the records of Virginia are in August 1663. The records of Accomack County, Virginia include depositions showing some political disagreement concerning the \\"Indians in the south,\\" but it is not clear what the circumstances are. Deposition was made by John Marvell on August 18, 1663 that \\"about five or six weeks ago he was at John Waltham's house where he saw Capt. Batts and others with him, but did not see any weapons or hostile behavior\\". On the same date, David Gibbins deposed that \\"at his master John Waltham's house, he saw Capt. Batts and his men, who were not armed and did not stand guard\\". The Court Orders of November 11, 1663 reveal that it was \\"ordered that John Waltham be dismissed from the office of constable\\", with Richard Kellum appointed constable instead. At the same court, \\"By the governor's command, John Waltham, Peter Walker and Richard Stevens were questioned about their actions among the Indians in the south\\" and \\"John Waltham was charged for entertaining Nathaniel Batts and his company at his house\\". Three days before the depositions in Accomack County, Virginia, the following record appears in Northampton County, Virginia, which references a list of accounts under the heading \\"An account of ye charge of Nathaniel Batts and his companies apprehending ye 15th of August 1663 by warrant of Coll. John Stringer\\". Among the account entries are various accounts \\"To a guard of\\" a specified number of men on specified dates over a period of days and \\"To Mr. John Curtis for 26 Men from Satterday neight tell Thursday morning is 4 days & 5 nights provisions for them; and the troubles of his house\\". These accounts were presented to the court on September 1, 1663. No further records have been found to explain the circumstances of these records found in Accomack and Northampton Counties, Virginia. John Curtis is presumably the same \\"Mr. John Curtis Guardian of Argoll Yardley\\" (Argoll Yeardley Jr.) as noted in Northampton County, Virginia records. It appears his sister, Anne, was wife of Argoll Yeardley (Sr.). Argoll Yeardley was brother of Francis Yeardley, who was associated with Nathaniel Batts as mentioned elsewhere herein. On December 5, 1654, John Curtis of Northampton purchased from Francis Yeardley, \\"one neck of land, north side of Nuswattack Creek, between two branches, commonly called Davis' Necke.\\" == (Possible) Travel to New Amsterdam (New York) in 1663 == New Amsterdam became New York in 1664. The Court Minutes of New Amsterdam on 3 April 1663, include two entries, seemingly unrelated, but which appear immediately adjacent to one another. One entry refers to a ‚ÄúNathaniel Badts‚Äù and the other to a ‚ÄúNathaniel Bats‚Äù. The records of New Amsterdam from 1653 to 1674It is not known if this is Nathaniel Batts of Virginia and Carolina, but it is an interesting possibility to consider. Considering that Mr. Balthazar de Haart, referenced below, had traveled to Virginia in 1662, this might increase the likelihood of that possibility. Anneken Litscho, pltf. v/s Nathanial Badts, defendant. Plaintiff demands 76 guilders 13 stivers. Defendant says he has not received any account thereof and demands it. The court ordered the plaintiff to furnish account. Anneken Litscho was widow of Daniel Liczko. They owned a tavern and inn and some have interpreted the preceding record as concerning amounts due for payments to Anneken as ‚Äúlandlady‚Äù of Nathaniel; the entry subsequent to this one note that Nathaniel had goods ‚Äústill at his lodgings,‚Äù which suggests he was traveling. Of note, in 1651, Daniel Liczko took part in an expedition on the Delaware River against Sweden. (See links to New Albion (colony), including reference to 1651 Map of Virginia and reference to Captain John Batte therein.) Daniel de Haart, pltf. v/s Nathaniel Bats, defendant. Plaintiff sold to defendant on the 26 March last, ‚Äúsome good for the sum of 227 guilders 12 stivers in beavers pay, on condition he should give bail for the pay, wherein he has failed to this date.‚Äù The defendant (Nathaniel) admitted to having bought the goods on such condition, and said the same are still at his lodgings. Defendant ordered to pay Plaintiff. Daniel de Haart, plaintiff, is referenced in an earlier record 13 June 1662 which states that Tomas Wandel [Thomas Wandell], defendant, stated that his brother Mr. Balthazar de Haart ‚Äúoffered him goods to sell in the Virginias on half the largest profit; that his brother had charged so high for the goods, that he could not sell them for the price and he returned a part of the good in Virginia to Mr. Balthazar de Haart.‚Äù Another record dated 3 March 1662 states that ‚ÄúWhereas Daniel de Haart remains the agent of his brother Balthasar de Haart, who has gone to the Virginias and hence to Old England.‚Äù == George Fox (Quaker) Visits Carolina and Nathaniel Batts in 1672 == Quaker missionary, George Fox, and his party on October 2, 1672 during travel through Carolina, \\"came to captaine Batts & there most of us lay that night by the fire.\\" George Fox refers to Nathaniel as \\"the Old Governor\\" and \\"Nathaniel Batts, who had been Governor of Roan-oak. He went by the name of Captain Batts, and had been a Rude, desperate man who has great command over ye countrie, especially over ye Indians.\\" An epistle addressed by George Fox to some Friends in Virginia in 1673 reads, ‚ÄúI received letters giving me an account of the service some of you had with and amongst the Indian king and his council, and If you go over again to Carolina, you may enquire of Captain Batts [Capt. Nathaniel Batts], the old Governor, with whom I left a paper to be read to the Emperor, and his thirty kings under him, of the Tuscaroras, who were come to treat for peace with the people of Carolina.‚ÄùThe American Journey of George Fox, 1671-3, Taken from a MS [Manuscript] in the Boldleian Library. The 1672/73 records of George Fox and his travels to Carolina are the last accounts of Nathaniel Batts being alive. Despite Nathaniel Batts being an early settler and resident of North Carolina, his name appears in only two state records within North Carolina and his name is not known to appear in any surviving county records in North Carolina. His September 1660 deed recorded in Norfolk County, Virginia was for land located in present-day Pasquotank County, North Carolina, for which records do not survive prior to circa 1700.Accomack County, Virginia Court Order Abstracts 1663-1666 Volume 1, Heritage Books, Inc., written by JoAnn Riley McKey. == Personal and family life == A Northumberland County, Virginia record on November 28, 1653, states the \\"court determined that\\" the death of George Leicham, marryner, \\"resulted from the disorderly and abusive drunkenness of Nathanial Batts, Thomas Bell, Peter Delabella, Richard Foundred and Sibilla (the wife of Christopher Jarvis).\\" A Norfolk County record circa 1655/56 shows that Nathaniel Batts was ordered to be set in ye stocks and remain during the pleasure of ye court in response to \\"Mr. Nathaniel Batts for being in drinke & threatening Mr. Conquest.\\"Transcriptions of Lower Norfolk County, Virginia, Volume 1, Wills and Deeds Book D, 1656-1666. On May 25, 1656, Nathaniel married Mary Woodhouse, widow and second wife of Colonel Henry Woodhouse. The marriage contract of Nathaniel Batts was dated April 20, 1656 and was witnessed by William Clayborne Junior (son of William Claiborne), Roger Green and John Ayres. The marriage contract stated that Nathaniel was \\"indebted to some men in Virginia and am now intended to bee married to Mrs. Mary Woodhouse ye relect & widow of Henry Woodhouse deceased, I doe by these presents firmely bind & engage my selfe not to meddle with any of ye said widdowes estate...\\" Henry Woodhouse was son of Henry Woodhouse, who had been governor of Bermuda around 1626 or 1627. The will of Henry Woodhouse names wife Maria/Mary and brother-in-law Charles Sothern; thus, it is possible that the maiden name of Mary Woodhouse Batts was Sothern. Charles Sothern may be the Charles Southern that died in 1671 in Bermuda, leaving will. A number of non-primary sources claim that Nathaniel Batts had a brother Richard Batts, a sea captain that possibly traded with Barbados; however, no original sources have been found to support these claims. Later he purchased an island in Albemarle Sound near the mouth of the Yeopim River that became known as Batts Island. Some charts refer to the island as Batts Grave (formerly known as Heriots Island) since he lived a solitary life on the island and was buried there. The island eroded through the years and was totally destroyed by a hurricane in 1950. Nathaniel Batts had a close friendship with Kickowanna, the daughter of an Algonquian Chief. In his later years, Nathaniel spent more time with Native Americans than he did with other European settlers. The narratives on Nathaniel Batts living a solitary life on the island and having a close friendship with Kickowanna is not confirmed by review of primary sources. The narrative appears to originate from the book ‚ÄúLiterature in the Albemarle‚Äù by Bettie Freshwater Pool, published in 1915, who recounts the ‚ÄúLegend of Batz‚Äôs Grave,‚Äù a story about a trader named Jesse Batz who fell in love with a Chowanoke maiden named Kickowanna. Ms. Pool referenced a Col. R. B. Creecy‚Äôs book entitled ‚ÄúGrandfather‚Äôs Tales‚Äù written in 1902 as her source. Col. Creecy was born in 1813 at Drummond‚Äôs Point on the Albemarle Sound and lived till at least 1905. Nathaniel was dead by December 1679, for on December 5, 1679, Joseph Chew, who married the relict of the dec‚Äôd, applied to administer the estate of Nathaniel Batts. Signed by John Harvey, John Jenkins, Nath. Slocum, Robt. Holden. On December 10, 1679, Joseph Chew and James Blunt of Shaftsbury Precinct in Albemarle County posted bond of 50,000 pounds of tobacco for said Chew to administer the estate of the dec‚Äôd. Witnessed by John Jenkins, Robt. Holden.Early Records of North Carolina. Volume II. Wills, Administrations, Inventories, Deeds 1677-1790 (From the Secretary of State Papers). A court held by the council in September 1694 (The North Carolina Higher-Court Records 1670-1696) reveal that Nathaniel Batts, who was long deceased at the time, had sold land to William Woollard, who had been warned to the contrary to buy it. The record states that ‚ÄúYour Orators Edward Smithweck and John Smithweck sonnes and heirs of Hugh Smithweck Late of precinct of Chowan deceased Humbly Sheweth That whereas _your Orators Father Hugh Smithweck comeing into this County about some 35 yeares since did seat upon a peece of Land in Chowan precinct and from time to time paid quitt rents for it being 416 Acres That sometime about 18 years since one Nathaniel Batts seats downe upon part of the said tract of Land and in some small time after sells his right to his Labour of the said Land where he satt downe to one William Woollard who although often warned to the contrary would buy it_ That sometime after your Orators Father dyeing your Orator Edward Smithweck did make continuall Claime to the said Land whereon the said Woollard did live and which he bought of the Said Batts aforesaid and your Orators att a Court holden for the precinct of Chowan about some 5 yeares since did there upon the same place make Claime of the said Land and forwarne the said Woollard dyes makeing his widow then knowne by the name of Sarah Woollard his executrix Your Orators sometime after did goe and take peaceable possession of their Lawfull right as being part of their said 416 Acres for which their father [paid] quitt rents for upon which [the] said Sarah Woollard Comences an action of trespass against your Orators and thereupon making Oath herself before the worshipfull Court and Jury that she had lost 80 head of Hoggs of 15 shillings‚Ä¶‚Äù The record goes on to say Sarah Woollard married Thomas Gillam and that Hugh Smithweck's claim was for only 370 acres of the said tract. == References External links== * rootsweb.com - Historical Political Personalities of Bertie County * rootsweb.com - Governors of Bertie County * http://www.historicnenc.com/durant.html * kindredtrails.com - North Carolina History Category:1620 births Category:1679 deaths Category:People of colonial North Carolina Category:17th-century American businesspeople ","title":"Nathaniel Batts"},{"id":"5600605","text":"The CRON-diet (Calorie Restriction with Optimal Nutrition)CRON-description is a nutrient-rich, reduced calorie diet developed by Roy Walford, Lisa Walford, and Brian M. Delaney.CRON-diet as a life-extension diet The CRON-diet involves calorie restriction in the hope that the practice will improve health and retard aging, while still attempting to provide the recommended daily amounts of various nutrients. Other names include CR-diet, Longevity diet, and Anti- Aging Plan. The Walfords and Delaney, among others, founded the CR Society International to promote the CRON-diet. ==Context== There is experimental evidence that calorie restriction can slow biological aging in mammals such as mice and monkeys, but the long-term effects in humans remain unknown. The biological mechanisms for the observed effects are not well understood. == Origins == The \\"Crew Kitchen\\" inside Biosphere 2 The CRON-diet was developed from data Walford compiled during his participation in Biosphere 2 from 1991 to 1993. The subjects ate a diet low in fat and in calories but \\"nutrient- dense\\", derived from the food crops raised inside the Biosphere. ==Debate on effectiveness== The writer Christopher Turner in The Telegraph reported that Walford claimed that the diet \\"will retard your rate of ageing, extend lifespan (up to perhaps 150 to 160 years, depending on when you start and how thoroughly you hold to it), and markedly decrease susceptibility to most major diseases.\\" The same article noted however that the diet \\"failed to dramatically increase Walford's lifespan; he died in 2004 aged 79.\\" A review of the effects of calorie restriction in humans by Anna Picca and colleagues in 2017 noted that direct evidence was limited to what had been \\"recorded from the members of the Calorie Restriction Society, who have imposed on themselves a regimen of severe CR with optimal nutrition (CRON), believing to extend in this way their healthy lifespan.\\" The review noted that bone density was reduced but that bone strength was improved and maximal aerobic capacity per unit body mass was maintained or increased, while measures of quality of life including depression and physical function were improved. The review observed that one outcome had been the development of calorie restriction mimetic drugs which would be tested in clinical trials on humans. ==Reception== The journalist Pagan Kennedy wrote an opinion piece for The New York Times, mentioning Walford's book The 120 Year Diet and his hope of living for more than 100 years on the CRON diet, noting that instead he died of Lou Gehrig disease at age 79: her piece was titled \\"The Secret to a Longer Life? Don't Ask These Dead Longevity Researchers\\". The journalist Emily Yoffe tried the CRON-diet for Slate. She wrote that Walford had written a book about the diet called Beyond the 120 Year Diet, in which a \\"typical dinner\\" consisted of salad, lentils, brown rice, bulgur, a stalk of broccoli, and a glass of skimmed milk.

Some recent literature, and recent molecular evidence, indicates that the Aplacophora may be polyphyletic, and therefore these taxonomists divide Solenogastres and Caudofoveata into separate classes.e.g. ==Morphology== In contrast to all other molluscan classes, the Aplacophora have no shell, and are instead covered by aragonitic sclerites (calcareous spicules), which can be solid or hollow. These spicules can be arranged perpendicular to one another within the cuticle to form a skeleton, or can stick up to form a palisade, or can lie flat against the cuticle. 80% of solenogaster species have a radula, while in others it is secondarily lost. The radula may bear one or more teeth per row; where there is more than one tooth, there is no central radular tooth. The radula grows by dividing existing teeth in two, or by adding a new tooth at the centre of the radular row. The salivary glands are very elaborate, and are an important character for taxonomy. Next to the mouth they have a unique sense organ, the vestibulum. The solenogastres do not have true ctenidia, although their gill-like structures resemble them. ==Development== During development many Solenogastres are covered by a spiny scleritome comprising spines or scale-like plates; this has been likened to the halwaxiid scleritome. Sclerites of Epimenia start out solid before developing a hollow stem that subsequently solidifies. ==Ecology== Diet Solenogasters feed on cnidaria and ctenophores, either sucking their bodily fluids or eating their tissue. They do not use their radulae to rasp prey, as other molluscs do. ==Phylogeny== There is some uncertainty regarding the phylogenetic position of the solenogasters. Traditionally considered to be the most basal molluscan group and the sister group to the Caudofoveata, alternatives to both of these statements have been proposed on various lines of evidence. Indeed, some molecular datasets plot Solenogastres as an outgroup to Mollusca. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Category:Mollusc subclasses ","title":"Solenogastres"},{"id":"5600636","text":"Vagovagal reflex refers to gastrointestinal tract reflex circuits where afferent and efferent fibers of the vagus nerve coordinate responses to gut stimuli via the dorsal vagal complex in the brain. The vagovagal reflex controls contraction of the gastrointestinal muscle layers in response to distension of the tract by food. This reflex also allows for the accommodation of large amounts of food in the gastrointestinal tracts. The vagus nerve, composed of both sensory afferents and parasympathetic efferents, carries signals from stretch receptors, osmoreceptors, and chemoreceptors to dorsal vagal complex where the signal may be further transmitted to autonomic centers in the medulla. Efferent fibers of the vagus then carry signals to the gastrointestinal tract up to two-thirds of the transverse colon (coinciding with the second GI watershed point). ==Function== The vagovagal reflex is active during the receptive relaxation of the stomach in response to swallowing of food (prior to it reaching the stomach). When food enters the stomach a \\"vagovagal\\" reflex goes from the stomach to the brain, and then back again to the stomach causing active relaxation of the smooth muscle in the stomach wall. If vagal innervation is interrupted then intra-gastric pressure increases. This is a potential cause of vomiting due to the inability of the proximal stomach smooth muscle to undergo receptive relaxation. The vagal afferents are activated during the gastric phase of digestion when the corpus and fundus of the stomach are distended secondary to the entry of a food bolus. The stimulation of the mechanical receptors located in the gastric mucosa stimulates the vagus afferents. The completion of the reflex circuit by vagus efferents leads to the stimulation of postganglionic muscarinic nerves. These nerves release acetylcholine to stimulate two end effects. One, the parietal cells in the body of the stomach are stimulated to release H+. Two, the ECL cells of the lamina propria of the body of the stomach are stimulated to release histamine. Vagal stimulation of the peptidergic neurons, occurring simultaneously, leads to the release of gastrin-releasing-peptide. Finally, the Delta cells are inhibited to reduce the inhibition of gastrin release. ==See also== * Vasovagal episode Vagus influence on gastric secretions. ==References== Binder, Henry. \\"Organization of the Gastrointestinal System.\\"Medical Physiology. 1st ed. 2002.

He died from tuberculosis in 1901 following a long illness. Gabrielsson was the most famous poet of the socialist wave of writers. He differed, however, from other writers in that his works called for reform rather than out and out revolutions. His poems were piercingly accurate. The reason for this was that when he wrote, he was doing so from personal experience. His childhood was passed in dire poverty. Even as a child he had to work as a construction laborer. His literary career began in 1892 when he found a job as a reporter in The Social Democrat. He later became the editor of the weekly People's Will. His most famous poem was And I would forget I?, which appeared in the October 21, 1892 issue of The Social Democrat.

He was born in Rio de Janeiro, where he lived and worked, having started his career in the 1980s as a writer for satirical magazine Casseta Popular. One of the most popular Brazilian comedians of his generation, the overweight Bussunda was famous for his impersonations of football striker Ronaldo and of Brazil's president Lula. He also did the voice of Shrek in the Brazilian Portuguese version of Shrek and Shrek 2. He was of Jewish descent. ==Nickname== \\"Bussunda\\" is said to derive from his school nickname \\"Besserman Sujismundo\\" (\\"Filthy Besserman\\"), since his parents and friends say he wasn't very fond of taking baths; it was a reference to \\"Sujismundo\\", a character used in a government-run educational campaign about urban pollution in the early 1970s - the term \\"sujismundo\\" is a combination of words \\"sujo\\" (dirty) and \\"imundo\\" (filthy). Besserman also said the word was a contraction of \\"two of my favorite things, but don't call me 'Bundeta'\\" (reference to \\"buceta\\" and \\"bunda\\" ‚Äì in Portuguese, vulgar slang for vagina and buttocks respectively), though this meaning is assumed to be a backronym. ==Death== Bussunda died of a heart attack in a hotel in the neighbourhood of Parsdorf in Vaterstetten, a suburb of Munich, Germany, where some members of Casseta & Planeta accompanied the Brazilian national team at the World Cup, for a series of TV shows. His body was flown from Germany back to Rio de Janeiro, where funeral services were held at the C.R. Flamengo gymnasium (Bussunda had been a long-time fan of Flamengo and often used his celebrity status to promote the club). He is buried at the S√£o Jo√£o Batista cemetery in Rio. Almost every TV show and magazine in Brazil paid a tribute to Bussunda. The special Casseta & Planeta episode dedicated to him reportedly had the best ratings of the show's history. The city of Rio de Janeiro named the main street of the Pan-American village \\"Av. Cl√°udio Besserman Vianna\\" after the comedian, and a public school also received his name. In May 2010, a biography about Bussunda was released in Brazil. The book, written by Guilherme Fiuza, was titled Bussunda - A vida do Casseta. ==References== * BBC \\"Comedian dies covering World Cup\\" June 17 2006 ==External links== * Category:1962 births Category:2006 deaths Category:Brazilian Jews Category:Brazilian male comedians Category:20th-century comedians ","title":"Bussunda"},{"id":"5600677","text":"Medical Laboratory Assistants (MLAs) prepare, and in some cases process samples within a pathology laboratory. They also utilise pre-analytical systems in order for biomedical scientists (BMS) or Medical Laboratory Scientific Officers to process the biochemical tests requested on the sample. The majority of an MLA's time is spent in processing specimens. As such, the MLA has to have excellent knowledge of their particular sample acceptance policy, whilst obeying the data protection act, patient confidentiality, COSHH and the Caldicott rules. Other duties an MLA may undertake include, setting up blood analyzers, running Quality Controls and manual controls prior to a BMS undertaking analysis on samples. Maintenance and decontamination is essential for the function of the machinery therefore MLAs carry out this role on a weekly or monthly basis. A typical method of sample acceptance (in a clinical chemistry lab) is as follows: # Sample is received. # Sample is checked (to ensure that the sample is sent in the correct container for the specimen). # Patient's details checked and matched on both form and sample (non-matching samples and/or forms rejected). # Sample and form labelled with unique identifying number (UIN). # Tests requested on form receipted onto UIN on computer system. # Samples placed either on pre-analytical system by MLA or analysed immediately by BMS (dependent on test requested). # UIN attached to patient using patient identifying details on form. MLA's also deal with all sample queries and give low level advice to clinical staff on sample acceptance and correct sampling method. They may also do minor upkeep on the pre-analytical systems as well as further upkeep on some point of care analysers -- depending on the laboratory in which they are based. ==Requirements== Requirements for a position of medical laboratory assistant vary from state to state, but they are generally as follows: * Legal age (18+ years) * High school diploma or equivalent * State-approved training * Successful completion of certification exam Medical laboratory assistants are required to have good analytical abilities and keen attention to detail.

The Parsi (Indian Zoroastrian) name for the procedure is djor-melavi (Gujarati, djor: strength, melavi: to introduce), which reflects the symbolic purpose of the \\"offering to water\\", which is to give it \\"strength\\" by purifying it (see Symbolism and Purpose, below). By metathesis 'ab-zohr' is pronounced ab-zor in the Zoroastrian Dari dialect. The procedure is also called the parahaoma rite, reflecting the technical name of the liquid being prepared and consecrated during the ritual. In the 9th-12th century texts of Zoroastrian tradition the procedure is also occasionally referred to as the hom-zohr, here also reflecting the use of the haoma plant in the rite. ==Procedure== Preparation The Haoma plant (Avestan, middle and modern Persian: h≈çm) is the source for the essential ingredient for the parahaoma (middle Persian: parah≈çm), the consecrated liquid that constitutes the offering (zaothra). In Zoroastrian tradition, two independent preparations of parahaoma are made for the offering. Both preparations must be made between sunrise and noon, in the Hawan gah (Avestan: havani ratu), the \\"time of pressing\\". The time of day of the Yasna service is itself dictated by this restriction. The first parahaoma is prepared during the preliminary rites (prior to the Yasna service) in which the site of worship is consecrated. The second parahaoma preparation occurs during the middle third of the Yasna service. The recipes for the two parahaoma preparations, though not identical, are largely the same. In both cases, the ingredients include three small haoma twigs; consecrated water; twigs and leaves from a pomegranate tree. The second parahaoma also includes milk (in Iran from a cow, in India from a goat). The consecration of the water and haoma (accompanied by ritual laving) also occur during the preliminary rites. First pressing In the first parahaoma, which is prepared immediately prior to the Yasna service (during the preliminary ritual that also sanctifies the site of worship), the leaves or small twigs from the pomegranate tree are cut into pieces, and together with the consecrated haoma twigs and a little consecrated water are repeatedly pounded and strained. The liquid is retained in a bowl, while the twig and leaf residue is placed next to the fire to dry. Second pressing The second parahaoma preparation occurs during the middle third of the Yasna service. It is prepared by the celebrant priest of the Yasna and is essentially the same as the first, but includes milk, and is accompanied by even more pounding and straining. This second parahaoma preparation begins with the recitation of Yasna 22, and continues until the beginning of Yasna 28 (Ahunavaiti Gatha). During the recitation of Yasna 25, the priest dedicates the mixture to \\"the waters\\" (see Aban), which mirrors the purpose of the parahaoma preparation (see below). The mortar remains untouched during the recitation of Yasna 28-30. Finally, during the recitation of Yasna 31-34, the priest pounds the mixture a last time and then strains the liquid into the bowl that also contains the first parahaoma. The twig and leaf residue from the second parahaoma is also placed next to the fire to dry. Offering Yasna 62 marks the beginning of the final stage of the Yasna service. At the beginning of the recitation of that chapter, the priest who made the first parahaoma moves the (now dry) twig and leaf residue from next to the fire into the fire itself. Although this is done at a specific point during the recitation of the liturgy, the burning of the residue is not an offering to the fire, but the ritually proper way to dispose of combustible consecrated material. Yasna 62.11 also marks the beginning of the actual ab-zohr. During the following recital of Yasna 62, 64, 65 and 68, the celebrant repeatedly pours the combined parahaomas between two bowls and the mortar, such that, by the end of Yasna 68, all three vessels contain the same amount of liquid. The service then concludes with the recitation of Yasna 72, immediately after which the priest carries the mortar with parahaoma to a well or stream. There, in three pourings, libations are made to the waters (Aban), accompanied by invocations to Aredvi Sura Anahita. The remaining parahaoma in the two bowls is given to persons attending the ceremony. Since the liquid, in its ritually pure state, is considered beneficial, participants may choose to drink a little of it, or provide some to infants or the dying. The remainder is poured away on the roots of fruit-bearing trees. ==Symbolism and purpose== The offering (the parahaoma mixture) represents animal life (the milk) and plant life (the sap of the pomegranate leaves and twigs), combined with the strengthening and healing properties attributed to haoma. Through the addition of consecrated water, the preparation of the parahaoma symbolically returns the life given by Aban ('the waters'). The principal purpose of the ab-zohr is to 'purify' those waters, as is evident in Yasna 68.1, where the zaothra ('offering') makes good for the damage done to water by humanity: \\"These offerings, possessing haoma, possessing milk, possessing pomegranate, shall compensate thee\\". This is underscored in Vendidad 14.4, where the appropriate atonement for the sin of killing a \\"water dog\\" (an otter) is an \\"offering to the waters.\\" Vendidad 18.72 also recommends its use as a general penance. According to a passage of the Avesta that survives only as a translation in Denkard 8.25.24, the ingredients and materials for an offering to the waters were carried by the priests accompanying an army so that soldiers could perform the ritual before battle. The decontamination symbolism in the ab-zohr is a reflection of Zoroastrian cosmogony, wherein the primeval waters (the lower half of the sky, upon which the universe rests, and from which two rivers encircle the earth) fear pollution by humankind. According to Bundahishn 91.1, Ahura Mazda promised the waters to \\"create one (i.e. Zoroaster) who will pour haoma into you to cleanse you again.\\" According to tradition, Zoroaster frequently made the offering to water (Zatspram 19.2-3), and received his revelation on a riverbank while preparing parahaoma (Zatspram 21.1). ==Bibliography== * * * Category:Zoroastrian rituals ","title":"Ab-Zohr"},{"id":"5600700","text":"Douglas R.

However, Varaz was deposed by the Sasanian king who didn't acknowledge his conversion to Christianity. Thus Javanshir became the king of Caucasian Albania.Cyril Toumanoff. Review of C. J. F. Dowsett's \\"The History of Caucasian Albanians by Movsƒìs Dasxuranci\\", Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, Vol. 25, No. 1/3. (1962), p. 366 ==Reign== Javanshir was known for his bravery and intelligence; he fought against the Arabs during the Muslim conquest of Persia on the side of the Sasanian Empire, and was rewarded by the Sasanian king Yazdegerd III himself two golden spears, two golden shields and a flag, probably the Drafsh e Kavian. In 636, he led an Albanian army, which alongside the Armenian prince Mushegh III Mamikonian and Grigor of Syunik, took part in the Battle of al-QƒÅdisiyyah between the Persian and Arab armies. However, the Sasanians were defeated, which made Javanshir lose hope. He then made a mutiny against his overlords and retreated to Caucasian Albania. Where he wrote a letter to Constans II and became an ally of the Byzantine Empire. He was then awarded with the title of patrikios, and recognized as king of the East. He also married to a noble from a princely family of Syunik. After his alliance with the Byzantines, he joined his forces with the Iberian king Adarnase I in an attack on Sasanian garrisons in Albania.Martindale, John Robert (1992), The Prosopography of the Later Roman Empire, pp. 13-14. Cambridge University Press, . He later expanded his dominion from Derbent to Aras river. Facing the threat of the Arab invasion on the south and the Khazar offensive on the north, Javanshir had to recognize the Caliph‚Äôs suzerainty, a move, which would prove to be a turning point in the country's history. Javanshir was assassinated, in 680, by the rival nobles, whose power he had tried to restrict. He was succeeded by Varaz Tiridates I. ==Depiction in Armenian Poetry and Historical Texts== The only historical source about the life and deeds of Javanshir comes from the Armenian text by Movses Kaghankatvatsi, known as History of the Land of Aghvank.Robert H. Hewsen, ‚ÄúEthno-History and the Armenian Influence upon the Caucasian Albanians,‚Äù in Classical Armenian Culture: Influences and Creativity, ed. Thomas J. Samuelian (Philadelphia: Scholars Press, 1982) Movses Kaghankatvatsi's text includes a poem dedicated to Javanshir Elegy on the Death of the Great Prince Jevansher by Davtak Kertogh (Davtak the Poet), a 7th-century Armenian poet and the first secular writer in Armenian literature.The Oxford History of Historical Writing: 400-1400 / Edited by Sarah Foot, Chase F. Robinson. ‚Äî Oxford University Press, 2012. ‚Äî Vol. 2. ‚Äî p. 189.:\\"The section on Juansers exploits concludes with the earliest piece of secular Armenian poetry since the adoption of Christianity to have reached us, in the form of an abecedarian elegy extolling the prince and bewailing his passing.\\"The Heritage of Armenian Literature: By Agop Jack Hacikyan, Gabriel Basmajian, Edward S. Franchuk, Nourhan Ouzounian, Wayne State University Press, 2002, P. 94 The only surviving poem by Kertogh is written in Armenian, in alphabetical acrostic verse. ==See also== *Caucasian Albania *Javanshir Fortress ==ReferencesSources== * * Category:680 deaths Category:Year of birth unknown Category:616 births Category:7th-century monarchs in Asia Category:7th-century Iranian people Category:Mihranids Category:Rebellions against the Sasanian Empire Category:Patricii Category:Converts to Christianity from Zoroastrianism Category:Vassal rulers of the Sasanian Empire Category:People of the Muslim conquest of Persia Category:Christians in the Sasanian Empire Category:Princes of Gardman ","title":"Javanshir"},{"id":"5600716","text":"{ class=\\"infobox\\" style=\\"width: 25em; font-size: 90%;\\" - colspan=\\"3\\" bgcolor=\\"#FF0000\\"  center; font-size: larger;\\"  Calle 146 - colspan=2 { width=100% style=\\"background: #f9f9f9;\\" - style=\\"vertical- align: center; text-align: center;\\" Calle 146 station, exterior view width=40%Mazur√©n width=20%‚óÑ Troncal Autonorte ‚ñ∫ width=40%Calle 142 } - Location Autopista Norte with Calle 150 - Neighborhood Usaqu√©n and Suba - style=\\"vertical-align: center;\\" Opened 2001 - style=\\"vertical-align: top; text-align: center;\\" colspan=3 bgcolor=\\"#FFFFFF\\" align=\\"center\\" } The simple station Calle 146 is part of the TransMilenio mass-transit system of Bogot√°, Colombia, which opened in the year 2000. ==Location== The station is located in northern Bogot√°, specifically on Autopista Norte with Calle 150.

It is a part of the Seventh-day Adventist education system, the world's second largest Christian school system.http://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/Opinion/2010/1115/For-real- education-reform-take-a-cue-from-the-Adventists\\"the second largest Christian school system in the world has been steadily outperforming the national average ‚Äì across all demographics.\\" It is in the Sierra foothill community of Placerville, California, United States. Established in 1913 as the Wide Awake School, serving 14 elementary students, the school moved to its present location in 1936 and became the Camino-Placerville Junior Academy, teaching grades K-10. The school later became El Dorado Junior Academy and existed as a K-10 program until 1996 when a decision was made to become a full K-12 school. The school became El Dorado Adventist School, and from 1996‚Äì2003, the high school program existed as an extension school of Rio Lindo Adventist Academy in Healdsburg. In the fall of 2003, the North American Division of Seventh-day Adventists gave El Dorado Adventist School the authorization to become a stand-alone, fully functioning K-12 institution, and in June 2004, the school celebrated its first official graduates. The Placerville and Camino Seventh- day Adventist Churches own El Dorado Adventist School in conjunction with the Northern California Conference, which supports and coordinates the efforts of 47 schools and over 3800 students. The Placerville Church has a membership of 757 and the Camino Church has a membership of 255. The pastors of the two churches are heavily involved in the school program of El Dorado Adventist School by serving on the school board, giving weekly worships and leading out in spiritual activities involving EAS students. == Service opportunities == Students are required to participate in 25 hours per year of community service activities (100 hours in order to graduate). The programs range from mission trips to locations such as Peru, Costa Rica, and the Dominican Republic, volunteer service at the Upper Room Dining Hall (a soup kitchen located down the road from the school), service days hosted by the faculty and staff at EAS, manual labor activities designed to beautify and improve the area around both EAS and the larger community, setting up a homeless shelter for the weekend, and other community activities. Some of the students have participated in El Dorado County Teen Court, a program that allows young people to be involved in the judicial process in the county and act as lawyers, bailiffs, and jury members in a real court setting. Other students have been involved with the El Dorado County Youth Commission, a group of various students from the public and private high school in the area who work with the Board of Supervisors in the county to create change for the youth. Many of the high school students have attended Youth With A Mission (YWAM) in San Francisco, a weekend program designed to put students in touch with the homeless there and to minister by serving them food and talking with them. ==Spiritual aspects== All students take religion classes each year. These classes cover topics in biblical history and Christian and denominational doctrines. Instructors in other disciplines also begin each class period with prayer or a short devotional thought, many of which encourage student input. The entire student body gathers together weekly in the auditorium for an hour- long chapel service. Outside the classrooms there is year-round spiritually oriented programming that relies on student involvement. ==Athletics== The Academy offers the following sports: *Basketball (boys' and girls') *Football (boys' and girls') *Volleyball (boys' and girls') ==See also== * List of Seventh-day Adventist secondary schools * Seventh-day Adventist education ==References== Category:High schools in El Dorado County, California Category:Adventist secondary schools in United States Category:Private high schools in California Category:Private middle schools in California Category:Private elementary schools in California ","title":"El Dorado Adventist School"},{"id":"5600739","text":"{ class=\\"infobox\\" style=\\"width: 25em; font-size: 90%;\\" - colspan=\\"3\\" bgcolor=\\"#FF0000\\"  center; font-size: larger;\\"  Calle 142 - colspan=2 { width=100% style=\\"background: #f9f9f9;\\" - style=\\"vertical- align: center; text-align: center;\\" width=40%Calle 146 width=20%‚óÑ Troncal Autonorte ‚ñ∫ width=40%Alcal√° } - Location Autopista Norte with Calle 144 - Neighborhood Usaqu√©n and Suba - style=\\"vertical-align: center;\\" Opened 2001 - style=\\"vertical-align: top; text-align: center;\\" } The simple station Calle 142 is part of the TransMilenio mass-transit system of Bogot√°, Colombia, which opened in the year 2000. ==Location== The station is located in northern Bogot√°, specifically on Autopista Norte with Calle 144.

For example, the expression is : 6 \\\\div 2 and it can be constructed of either two ways: * \\"How many parts of the size of 2 must be added to get the amount of 6?\\" (Quotition division) : One can write :: 6 = \\\\underbrace{2+2+2}_{\\\\text{3 parts}}. : Since it takes 3 parts, the conclusion is that :: 6 \\\\div 2 = 3. * \\"What is the size of 2 equal parts whose sum is that of 6?\\".

This is essentially equivalent to the commutativity of multiplication in multiplication arithmetic. Division involves thinking about a whole in terms of its parts. One frequent division notation, is that a natural number of equal parts, is known as a partition to educators who teach it. The basic concept behind a partition is sharing. In sharing instead the whole entity becomes an integer number with equal parts. What quotition focuses on, is explained by removing the word integer in the last sentence. Allow the number to be any fraction and you may have a quotition instead of a partition. ==See also== * List of partition topics ==References== * * ==External links== * A University of Melbourne web page shows what to do when the fraction is a ratio of integers or rational.

The film stars Gael Garc√≠a Bernal, who received strong critical acclaim for his portrayal of the main character Elvis, as well as William Hurt, Pell James, Paul Dano and Laura Harring. The film is deeply rooted in a Southern Gothic style and features themes similar to those in Greek tragedy. It was written by its British director James Marsh and also by Milo Addica, the Academy Award‚Äìnominated writer of Monster's Ball and Birth. ==Synopsis== A man enlisted in the U.S. Navy, Elvis Valderez (Gael Garc√≠a Bernal), is discharged and purchases a used car to travel to his ‚Äúhome‚Äù in Corpus Christi, Texas. Elvis arrives at the church of Pastor David Sandow (William Hurt). He watches his sermon from the back of the church and then follows him and his family, including his wife Twyla (Laura Harring), son Paul (Paul Dano) and daughter Malerie (Pell James), to their home. Pastor Sandow confronts Elvis, who shows him a snapshot of his mother Yolanda, with whom he had relations many years ago before becoming a Christian. Pastor Sandow becomes agitated and tells Elvis that he has a family now and is a popular member of the community. He tells Elvis to call him so they can talk, though later tells his family that the young man simply wanted to become a member of the church and to not associate with him. Elvis moves into a local motel and gets a job as a pizza delivery man. Having met Pastor Sandow's teenage daughter Malerie earlier at the church, he soon begins to pick her up from school where they go on drives and take walks at a local park. They start a passionate affair and have sexual relations on a regular basis. Meanwhile, Pastor Sandow's son Paul leads a high school movement where he attempts to change the school's science curriculum from evolution to intelligent design, though his plans are rejected by the school board. Disappointed by this setback, Paul, who leads a Christian rock band at his father's church, performs an intimate song before the congregation about his frustrations, the song being a cover of Sparklehorse's \\"Sad and Beautiful World\\". Pastor Sandow severely chastises his son for such indulgence. One evening, Elvis sneaks into the Sandow's home to spend the night with Malerie. After they have sex, he leaves the house in the middle of night and is spotted by Paul. He follows Elvis back to his motel and interrogates him about his affair with his sister. Paul threatens to tell his father and Elvis abruptly stabs Paul in the stomach, killing him. Elvis dumps Paul's body in a nearby pond and returns Paul's car to the Sandow's house. The next day the police are called to investigate Paul's disappearance and the family becomes distraught. Pastor Sandow believes Paul has run away because of the argument they had about his musical performance. Meanwhile, Elvis continues his affair with Malerie and she soon becomes pregnant. Elvis takes Malerie to the pond where he dumped Paul's body and reveals to her what happened. Deeply in love with Elvis, Malerie holds his hands and they pray together to God and ask for forgiveness. After seeing Elvis one day at a traffic light, Pastor Sandow follows him to his motel. Together, they drive to a local archery range where he teaches Elvis to shoot with Paul's hunting bow. He invites Elvis to dinner where he sits at the family table in Paul's chair. In private, Elvis explains to Malerie that his arrival at dinner is because of his acceptance into her father's church. Elvis soon moves into the Sandow's home, taking Paul's bedroom. During a Sunday sermon, Pastor Sandow's wife Twyla walks out of the church, still distraught over Paul's disappearance and doubting the existence of God. She walks into a busy street of traffic and attempts suicide, but Elvis saves her from injury. Elvis begins to plant flowers in the family garden, and Twyla compliments him on his work, slowly accepting him into the family. Malerie and Elvis continue to have sexual relations, with Elvis sneaking into her room each night. One Sunday, Pastor Sandow finally decides to make a confession to his congregation. He reveals that Elvis is his illegitimate son, the product of an affair he had many years ago with his mother Yolanda, a prostitute. Malerie, sitting next to Elvis, is stunned by the revelation and stares at him though he will not meet her gaze. Pastor Sandow asks Elvis to join him on stage and he is accepted into the congregation with enthusiastic applause. Later, Elvis and Malerie are having lunch together. Malerie is repulsed and distraught, but Elvis simply places a paper crown upon his head when she says to him, \\"We‚Äôre going to hell.\\" Elvis attempts to enter Malerie's room that night but the door is locked. The next day, Malerie embraces her mother in tears in the backyard of the Sandow's home. Elvis, watching from an upstairs window, is greeted by the hateful gaze of Twyla, suggesting that she now knows their secret. Pastor Sandow arrives at his church alone prepared to go about the day's business. A long camera shot through the Sandow's picturesque home eventually reveals Elvis placing the dead bodies of Malerie and Twyla (whom he presumably killed) on Pastor Sandow's bed. Malerie is still breathing, and Elvis smothers her with a pillow. Elvis then sets fire to the Sandow home. Elvis drives in Paul's car to Pastor Sandow's church. With blood on his shirt and hands, he walks into Pastor Sandow's office and says to him, \\"I need to get right with God\\". ==Cast== {  - bgcolor=\\"#CCCCCC\\" ! Actor !!

Roger Ebert gave it 3.5/4 calling it, ‚Äúthe kind of work where characters develop on their own, without consulting the book of clich√©s‚Äù. Empire, a UK film magazine, called it, ‚ÄúA compelling, intelligent and provocative sins-of- the-father story with a terrific ensemble cast, and a standout Mr. Ripley turn by the ever-versatile Gael Garc√≠a Bernal.‚Äù It was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 2005 Cannes Film Festival. ==ReferencesExternal links== * * Category:2005 films Category:American drama films Category:British drama films Category:British films Category:Films set in Texas Category:Films shot in Austin, Texas Category:Films shot in Corpus Christi, Texas Category:English-language films Category:Incest in film Category:2005 drama films Category:Films directed by James Marsh Category:American films ","title":"The King (2005 film)"},{"id":"5600772","text":"{ class=\\"infobox\\" style=\\"width: 25em; font-size: 90%;\\" - colspan=\\"3\\" bgcolor=\\"#FF0000\\"  center; font-size: larger;\\"  Prado - colspan=2 { width=100% style=\\"background: #f9f9f9;\\" - style=\\"vertical- align: center; text-align: center;\\" width=40%Alcal√° width=20%‚óÑ Troncal Autonorte ‚ñ∫ width=40%Calle 127 } - Location Autopista Norte with Calle 128 B - Neighborhood Usaqu√©n and Suba - style=\\"vertical-align: center;\\" Opened 2001 - style=\\"vertical-align: top; text-align: center;\\" } The simple station Prado is part of the TransMilenio mass-transit system of Bogot√°, Colombia, which opened in the year 2000. ==Location== The station is located in northern Bogot√°, specifically on Autopista Norte with Calle 128 B.

The Million Dollar Round Table (MDRT) is a trade association formed in 1927 to help Insurance brokers and financial advisors establish best business practices and develop ethical and effective ways to increase client interest in financial products, specifically risk based products like life insurance, disability and long term care. As of the end of 2008 the organization has more than 39,000 members in 82 countries and territories. The name comes from a group of 32 successful life insurance agents who met at the Peabody Hotel in Memphis, Tennessee. Each agent could demonstrate they had sold more than $1,000,000 of life insurance that year. Their meeting focused on improving technical knowledge and enhancing their sales abilities as well as maintaining ethical standards in the industry. The 1927 meeting evolved into the formation of the organization that exists today. An organization dedicated to encouraging ethical values, sharing ideas and concepts clients have found to be valuable and helping to improve business practices. MDRT conduct annual meetings which is open to all members. These meetings are held in North America, as well as in Asia. Each year more than 10,000 members and guests attend. MDRT uses the concept of the \\"Whole Person\\" which was first presented by the philosopher Mortimer Adler. According to Adler, \\"Whole Persons are engaged in a lifetime quest to achieve balance and congruity in all aspects of their lives and continually seek to develop their full human potential.\\" Annual qualification requirements for joining include demonstrating a set annual production requirement plus agreeing to adhere to a strict code of ethics. Ethical violations will result in dismissal. To be eligible for a basic membership in 2020 for example, an applicant must meet a production goal of $190,000 in first year commission. MDRT also has established two additional tiers of qualification - Court of the Table and Top of the Table. To qualify for these higher tiers of membership, the applicant must demonstrate annual commission of first year income three to six times the base requirement.2017 Membership Requirements, https://www.mdrt.org/membership/requirements/ ==References== Category:Organizations established in 1927 Category:Insurance industry organizations ","title":"Million Dollar Round Table"},{"id":"5600797","text":"Dramelay is a commune in the Jura department in Franche-Comt√© in eastern France. ==Population See also == * Communes of the Jura department == References == * INSEE statistics Category:Communes of Jura (department) ","title":"Dramelay"},{"id":"5600816","text":"{ class=\\"infobox\\" style=\\"width: 25em; font-size: 90%;\\" - colspan=\\"3\\" bgcolor=\\"#FF0000\\"  center; font-size: larger;\\"  Calle 127 - colspan=2 { width=100% style=\\"background: #f9f9f9;\\" - style=\\"vertical- align: center; text-align: center;\\" width=40%Prado width=20%‚óÑ Troncal Autonorte ‚ñ∫ width=40%Pepe Sierra } - Location Autopista Norte with Calle 125 - Neighborhood Usaqu√©n and Suba - style=\\"vertical-align: center;\\" Opened 2001 - style=\\"vertical-align: top; text-align: center;\\" } The simple station Calle 127 is part of the TransMilenio mass-transit system of Bogot√°, Colombia, which opened in the year 2000. ==Location== The station is located in northern Bogot√°, specifically on Autopista Norte with Calle 125.

Montoya De Hernandez, 473 U.S. 531 (1985), was a U.S. Supreme Court case regarding the Fourth Amendment's border search exception and balloon swallowing.. ==Background== Rose Elvira Montoya de Hernandez entered the United States at Los Angeles International Airport from Bogot√°, Colombia. Customs inspectors detained Montoya de Hernandez upon her arrival based upon a suspicion that she was smuggling drugs. After 16 hours and a rectal examination by a physician that produced a balloon containing a foreign substance, she passed balloons filled with cocaine from her alimentary canal. The defendant had claimed that she was pregnant, and she was given the opportunity to undergo an X-ray, but she refused after being informed that she would have to be handcuffed en route to the hospital. Over the next three days, the defendant passed 88 balloons filled with over one pound of cocaine. At trial, Montoya de Hernandez alleged that her Fourth Amendment rights were violated by an unreasonable detention. The U.S. government contended that the inspectors had reasonable suspicion that the defendant-respondent was a drug smuggler. She had a noticeable bulge in her abdomen when she was detained, and a female inspector searched her revealing that Montoya de Hernandez was wearing two sets of elastic underpants and had paper towels lining her crotch area (as balloon swallowing makes bowel movements hard to control). A federal district court disagreed with Montoya de Hernandez's Fourth Amendment claim, and she was subsequently convicted for federal narcotics offenses. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the district court's conviction, on the grounds that the district court had incorrectly refused to suppress evidence used against the defendant. The federal government appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which granted certiorari. ==Decision== The Supreme Court, in an opinion by Justice Rehnquist joined by Chief Justice Burger and Justices White, Blackmun, Powell and O'Connor, reversed the Ninth Circuit's holding that defendant was subject to an unreasonable search and seizure and upheld the conviction entered for charges brought by the government because custom agents were subject to a reasonable suspicion standard under the Fourth Amendment for detaining suspects. The Supreme Court held that the detention of a traveler at the border, beyond the scope of a routine customs search and inspection, is justified at its inception if customs agents, considering all the facts surrounding the traveler and her trip, reasonably suspect that the traveler is smuggling contraband in her alimentary canal; here, the facts, and their rational inferences, known to the customs officials clearly supported a reasonable suspicion that respondent was an alimentary canal smuggler. Justice Stevens filed a concurring opinion, while Justice Brennan, joined by Justice Marshall dissented, stating that \\"Indefinite involuntary incommunicado detentions \\"for investigation\\" are the hallmark of a police state, not a free society\\".. ==See also== *Border search exception *List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 473 ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:United States controlled substances case law Category:United States Fourth Amendment case law Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Burger Court Category:1985 in United States case law ","title":"United States v.

She was the heir of the Margraviate of Montferrat. Born in Casale, she was daughter of William VII, Marquess of Montferrat and his second wife Beatrice of Castile. Her maternal grandparents were King Alfonso X of Castile and his wife Violante of Aragon. Yolande (variation of Violante) was named after her grandmother. In 1284, Andronikos II, a widower by his first marriage with Anna of Hungary, married Yolanda (who was renamed Eirene as Empress). She and Andronikos II were distant cousins, both being descendants of Andronikos Doukas Angelos (ca. 1122-1185). With her, Eirene brought the Montferrat rights to the kingdom of Thessalonica, a dominion that, despite having been conquered half-a-century before Eirene's birth by the Byzantine state of Epirus, was still claimed by its short-lived (1204‚Äì1224) Montferrat royal dynasty. It was later proven that the Italian Montferrat had no living male heirs of the Aleramici dynasty, and Eirene's sons were entitled to inherit it upon the 1305 death of Eirene's brother John I, Marquess of Montferrat. The marriage produced the following children: * John Palaiologos (c. 1286‚Äì1308), despotes. * Bartholomaios Palaiologos (born 1289), died young. * Theodore I, Marquis of Montferrat (1291‚Äì1338). * Simonis Palaiologina (1294‚Äìafter 1336), who married King Stefan Milutin of Serbia. * Theodora Palaiologina (born 1295), died young. * Demetrios Palaiologos (1297‚Äì1343), despotƒìs. Father of Irene Palaiologina. * Isaakios Palaiologos (born 1299), died young. Eirene's stepson, Michael IX Palaiologos was intended to succeed her husband as emperor, but ultimately it was Michael's son Andronikos III Palaiologos, who became the successor instead of Michael. This was largely due to the work Eirene did to ensure some power and property to her own offspring. Eirene left Constantinople in 1303 and settled in Thessalonica.

It is a membrane-spanning protein and carries sugar molecules. It is heavily glycosylated (60%). Glycophorins are rich in sialic acid, which gives the red blood cells a very hydrophilic-charged coat. This enables them to circulate without adhering to other cells or vessel walls. A particular mutation in Glycophorins is thought to produce a 40% reduction in risk of severe malaria. == Identification == After separation of red cell membranes by SDS- polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and staining with periodic acid-Schiff staining (PAS), four glycophorins have been identified. These have been named glycophorin A, B, C, and D in order of the quantity present in the membrane, gylycophorin A being the most and glycophorin D the least common. A fifth (glycophorin E) has been identified within the human genome but cannot easily be detected on routine gel staining. In total, the glycophorins constitute ~2% of the total erythrocyte membrane protein mass.

The intersection shown is 9th and Hennepin, the subject of a song by the same name by Tom Waits. Esquire in 2006; demolished in 2016 to make way for luxury high-rises Hennepin Avenue is a major street in Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States. It runs from Lakewood Cemetery (at West 36th Street), north through the Uptown District of Southwest Minneapolis, through the Virginia Triangle, the former \\"Bottleneck\\" area west of Loring Park. It then goes through the North Loop in the city center, to Northeast Minneapolis and the city's eastern boundary, where it becomes Larpenteur Avenue as it enters Lauderdale in Ramsey County at Highway 280. Hennepin Avenue is a Minneapolis city street south/west of Washington Avenue, and is designated as Hennepin County Road 52 from Washington Avenue to the county line. ==Overview== In Downtown Minneapolis, Hennepin Avenue serves as a major entertainment thoroughfare, dubbed the Hennepin Theatre District. It also serves as the dividing line between \\"North\\" and \\"South\\" street addresses. Across the river, it divides \\"Northeast\\" and \\"Southeast\\" street addresses. The Theatre District contains four historic and architecturally significant theaters for live performances. The State Theatre, the Orpheum Theatre, the Pantages Theatre and the Goodale Theater (formerly the Shubert Theatre on North 7th Street). Also, the Hennepin Center for the Arts and the Cowles Center for Dance and the Performing Arts are located on the artery. For sections south of the Mississippi River, Hennepin Avenue follows stretches of an old Indian trail from Saint Anthony Falls to Lake Calhoun. It was named after Father Louis Hennepin, a Roman Catholic priest who explored the interior of North America for France while it was under French control. Hennepin Avenue is one of the oldest streets in the city and was the first road to cross the Mississippi River, in 1855, when the first Hennepin Avenue suspension bridge was completed. Many important institutions and structures have been built on Hennepin, including the Minneapolis Great Northern Depot, the Uptown Theater, the Walker Art Center, the Basilica of St. Mary, St. Mark's Episcopal Cathedral, Hennepin Avenue United Methodist Church, Minneapolis Community and Technical College, Minneapolis Central Library, the Lumber Exchange Building, the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis and the Suburban World Theater. One of the oldest gay bars in the city, The Saloon, is also located on Hennepin. The street has achieved iconic status in Minneapolis culture, memorialized in songs by Tom Waits, The Hold Steady and Lucinda Williams, among others. Its 600 block downtown was once home to Block E, a sometimes-rowdy collection of bars and independent businesses ultimately acquired by the city and demolished in 1988. It is also a popular parade route, used by the annual Aquatennial celebration held in July, and since the 1990s has been the traditional route of the city's LGBTQ Pride parade. Once a two-way avenue, the Theatre District portion was changed in 1980 to a one-way northbound with a bus-only lane southbound. \\"The Environmental Protection Agency was concerned with the air quality in downtown Minneapolis. Turning the streets into one-way lowered the near dangerous high levels of pollution\\". However, on October 10, 2009, it reverted to a two-way street, with its bike lanes being transferred one block west to First Avenue (which was also switched from one-way to two-way at the same time). This change was hoped by the city to create urban vibrancy, quicker travel times, and to avoid confusing one-ways. ==See also== *Nicollet Island *Mayo Clinic Square, nee Block E ==Gallery== Image:Koehler Rainy Evening on Hennepin Avenue.jpgRobert Koehler painting Rainy Evening on Hennepin Avenue c. 1902.

The ancient hundred of Penwith was larger than the local government district of Penwith (1974‚Äì2009) which took its name. Daphne du Maurier in Vanishing Cornwall suggests that the name, Penwith, has three renderings, \\"the last promontory,\\" \\"promontory on the left, and \\"the headland of slaughter,\\" thus suggesting that this area might have been the site of prehistoric invasions of sea-borne fighters, or perhaps tribal battles. The eastern part became part of Kerrier District. All of the Hundreds of Cornwall belonged, and still belong, to the Duchy of Cornwall apart from Penwith which belonged to the Arundells of Lanherne. The Arundells sold it to the Hawkins family in 1813 and the Hawkins' went on to sell it to the Paynters in 1832. The Lordship of Penwith came with a great number of rights over the entire hundred. These included: rights to try certain cases of trespass, trespass on the law, debt and detinue, to appoint a jailor for the detention of persons apprehended, to receive high-rent from the lords of the principal manors and to claim the regalia of the navigable rivers and havens, the profits of the royal gold and silver mines, and all wrecks, escheats, deodands, treasure trove, waifs, estrays, goods of felons and droits of admiralty happening within the hundred.National Archives. http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/a2a/records.aspx?cat=021-ar_6&cid;=-1#-1 The main settlement was Penzance .

He was found liable under civil proceedings for the Omagh bombing which killed 29 people. ==Brothers== His brother Sean died in December 1975, when a landmine he was preparing for an attack on the British Army exploded prematurely. Another brother, Peter, served 14 years in prison for Provisional Irish Republican Army offenses. Yet another brother, Michael, went on trial in Vilnius, Lithuania, accused of trying to purchase arms and explosives for the Real IRA, was found guilty and sentenced to twelve years in jail, a conviction that was overturned with the defendant acquitted upon the completion of a retrial in 2013, largely due to the defence's argument that Michael was the subject of entrapment, by MI5 agents. ==IRA and Real IRA career== Liam Campbell first came to the attention of the British and Irish security forces in the early 1980s and became the subject of an exclusion order in 1983 barring him from entering Northern Ireland.  Omagh bombing  Campbell was named by the BBC as one of the perpetrators of the 1998 Omagh bombing in a Panorama documentary. He never faced criminal charges but was found liable for the bombing in a civil trial, along with Michael McKevitt, Colm Murphy and Seamus Daly. The men sued by the Omagh families, BBC News, Monday, 8 June 2009. The case, brought by relatives of the 29 victims, resulted in an award of combined damages of over ¬£1.5m. He was believed to be a member of the Real IRA army council during the bombing. The damages were never paid. == Imprisonment == In May 2004, Campbell was convicted by a court in the Republic of Ireland for membership of the Real IRA and was sentenced to eight years imprisonment. In May 2009, he was arrested following the issue of a European Arrest Warrant at the behest of the Lithuanian authorities, where he was wanted in connection with a gun running plot which saw his brother Michael arrested. Campbell remained in prison for four years and was released in 2013 following the decision of Belfast Recorders Court to deny Campbell's extradition to Lithuania. The court ruled that \\"[Campbell] was likely to be held in conditions which would be inhuman and degrading.\\" ==References== Category:Fugitives wanted on arms smuggling charges Category:Irish republicans Category:Irish republicans imprisoned by non-jury courts Category:Living people Category:People from Dundalk Category:Provisional Irish Republican Army members Category:Real Irish Republican Army members Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Liam Campbell"},{"id":"5601130","text":"Pyramidellidae, common name the pyram family, or pyramid shells, is a voluminous taxonomic family of mostly small and minute ectoparasitic sea snails, marine heterobranch gastropod molluscs. The great majority of species of pyrams are micromolluscs. The pyram family is distributed worldwide with more than 6,000 named species in more than 350 nominal genera and subgenera. This family of micromollusks has been little studied and the phylogenetic relationships within the family are not well worked out. There is an absence of a general consensus regarding which species belong to a specific genus or subgenus, contributing to much confusion. Schander (1999) names more than 300 supraspecific names. As there has been no serious generic revision of the genera worldwide, generic polyphyly can be expected to be rampant throughout the family. However, the family itself is deemed monophyletic.. However a study in 2011 seems to indicate that this family is deeply nested within the Pulmonata instead of the Heterobranchia. Dinapoli A, Zinssmeister C, Klussman-Kolb A. 2011. New insights into the phylogeny of the Pyramidellidae (Gastropoda). Journal of Molluscan Studies 77:1-7. The family is currently divided into 11 subfamilies (Ponder & Lindberg 1997). An alternative interpretation is that the family Pyramidellidae is but one of six families within the superfamily Pyramidelloidea (Schander, van Aartsen & Corgan 1999). Many species are rare or infrequently recorded. ==Subfamilies== Subfamilies included within the family Pyramidellidae vary according to the taxonomy consulted.

The species found at the Cape Verdes are mainly endemic species. ==Shell description== The length of the slender, elongated (turreted or conical) shells varies between 0.5 mm and 3.5 cm, but most species in the family have shells which are smaller than 13 mm. The texture of these shells is smooth or sculptured in various forms such as ribs and spirals. Their color is mostly white, cream or yellowish, sometimes with red or brown lines. The shell of these snails has a blunt, heterostrophic (i.e. whorls appear to be coiled in the opposite direction to those of the teleoconch) protoconch, which is often pointed sideways or wrapped up. The teleoconch is dextrally coiled, but the larval shells are sinistral. This results in a sinistrally coiled protoconch. The columella has usually one, but sometimes several, spiral folds. The aperture is closed by an oligogyrous operculum. The operculum is ovoid and paucispiral, with the apex anterior, a thread-like arcuate ridge on the proximal side, the inner margin notched in harmony with the plaits of the pillar when prominent. The species are characterized by the lack of jaw or radula, because they are ectoparasites (mostly on polychaetes or other molluscs). ==Life habits== The Pyramidellidae are ectoparasites, feeding mainly on other molluscs and on annelid worms, but some are known to feed on peanut worms and crustaceans. A few species in the family Pyramidellidae, such as Otopleura mitralis, are symbiotic with sea anemones, such as Neoaiptasia morbilla. Roger H. Goodwill et. al. (2009), A sea anemone symbiotic with gastropods of eight species in the Mariana Islands; Micronesica 41(1): 117‚Äì130, 2009 They do not have a radula. Instead their long proboscis is used to pierce the skin of its prey and suck up its fluids and soft tissues. The eyes on the grooved tentacles are situated toward the base of the tentacles. These tentacles have a concave surface. Between the head and the propodium (the foremost division of the foot), a lobed process called the mentum (= thin projection) is visible. This mentum is slightly indented in midline. These gastropods are hermaphrodites, laying eggs in jelly-like masses on the shell of its host. Some species have spermatophores. ==Name derived from shape== The name of this taxonomic family comes from the shape of the shell, which is like a pyramid.Tenney, Sanborn and Tenney, Abby. Natural history of animals; Containing brief descriptions of the animals figured on Tenney's Natural history tablets, but complete without the tablets, p. 202 (Scribner, Armstrong & Co., 1875): \\"The Pyramid-Shells are so named from their shape\\" More specifically, the shape is like a right circular cone,Step, Edward.

Protoconch of Haliotis asinina when the torsion is complete. A protoconch (meaning first or earliest or original shell) is an embryonic or larval shell which occurs in some classes of molluscs, e.g., the initial chamber of an ammonite or the larval shell of a gastropod. In older texts it is also called \\"nucleus\\". The protoconch may sometimes consist of several whorls, but when this is the case, the whorls show no growth lines. The whorls of the adult shell, which are formed after the protoconch, are known as the teleoconch. The teleoconch starts forming when the larval gastropod settles and becomes a juvenile. Quite often there is a visible line of demarcation where the protoconch ends and the teleoconch begins, and there may be a noticeable change in sculpture, or a sudden appearance of sculpture at that point. In some gastropod groups (such as the Architectonicidae), the teleoconch whorls spiral in the opposite direction to the protoconch. In those cases, the shell is called heterostrophic. In species which have a veliger or swimming larval stage which hatches out of egg capsules, there are two parts to the protoconch. The first part of the protoconch (which is formed within the embryonic egg capsule) is called protoconch 1, while the part that is formed after the larva has hatched is called protoconch 2. There is often a different sculpture or ornamentation on protoconch 1 compared with protoconch 2, and this can be distinguished under the microscope. The structure of the protoconch has been widely used as a discriminating feature in gastropod systematics. The homologous structure in bivalves (clams) is called the prodissoconch. == Examples == Comparison of the whole shell and the protoconch of Atlanta lesueurii: { Apical view of the whole shell. whorls Growth series of Caecum glabrum showing protoconch in bottom image. } == References == Category:Mollusc shells ","title":"Protoconch"},{"id":"5601144","text":"J√≥zef Kremer J√≥zef Kremer (February 22, 1806, Krak√≥w - June 2, 1875 Krak√≥w), was a Polish historian of art, a philosopher, an aesthetician and a psychologist. ==Life== He studied at Krak√≥w, Berlin, Heidelberg and Paris. He was a professor of philosophy and rector of the Jagiellonian University in Krak√≥w: 1847, assistant professor; 1850, full professor; 1865, Dean of the Faculty of Philosophy; in academic year 1870‚Äì71, rector. He was a member of the Polish Academy of Learning from the day of its founding (1872). Professor of art history and aesthetics of Academy of Fine Arts in Krak√≥w. Kremer was the first proponent of Hegelianism in Poland. In 1843 he published the first volume of Listy z Krakowa (Letters from Krak√≥w), a dissertation in aesthetics in the Hegelian spirit (vols. 1-3, Vilnius 1855-1856), which brought him recognition and renown. Also his Wyk≈Çad systematyczny filozofii [A systematic course of philosophy] (vol. 1, Krak√≥w 1849; vol. 2, Vilinius 1852), apart from the work of Karol Libelt, the first systematic textbook of philosophy in 19th- century Poland, was well received. Kremer's popularity and fame was, however, ensured primarily by his Podr√≥≈º do W≈Çoch (Journey to Italy; vols. 1-5, Vilnius 1859-64), which soon found place among the classics of Polish literature, and its excerpts were included in textbooks and anthologies of the day. Thanks to the efforts of Henryk Struve, in 1877-80 a twelve-volume edition of Kremer's collected works was published in Warsaw. No other Polish philosopher contemporary of Kremer's could boast such a publication. Kremer's most important achievement in psychology was the systematic division of psychic phenomena into the conscious and the unconscious, and the treatment of anthropology as a science which probes the mutual relations between these two. By considering the act as the best source of information about a person, Kremer anticipated Wilhelm Dilthey's position. ==Bibliography== * J√≥zef Kremer (1806-1875), ed.

The filter was devised with the collaboration of gemmology students of the Chelsea College of Science and Technology where Basil Anderson was an instructor for the Gemmological Association of Great Britain. Since this filter allows transmission of both deep-red wavelengths around 690 nanometres and yellow-green wavelengths, around 570 nanometres, that matched emerald's emission and absorption characteristics, this filter was initially recommended to assist the discrimination between natural emerald and its simulants such as green glass, tourmaline, peridot, etc. This discrimination is possible because chromium (containing iron) and vanadium-free emeralds emit a red fluorescence when illuminated by white light that also has a content of ultraviolet wavelengths. Synthetic emeralds were commercially introduced around 1940. These produce the same pink-red response as some emeralds through the Chelsea filter. However, although this filter is unable to predictably discriminate between natural and synthetic emerald, it has been subsequently found capable of distinguishing aquamarine, blue topaz, and their blue synthetic spinel simulants, because unlike natural gemstones, blue cobalt-containing synthetic spinels emit a red fluorescence under white light. Chelsea Colour Filter is a UK Trademark held by The Gemmological Association of Great Britain (UK Trademark Registration No. 1473951). ==Use== Hold the filter an inch or two from the eye. Light the stone with a strong incandescent light bulb or torch, not LED. The stone may appear to change colour. The filter must be held near to the eye but there is no need to hold the filter close to the stone, even items in showcases can be examined providing they are lit by strong lights. Chelsea Filters were also used to help separate aquamarine and natural zircon from synthetic flame- fusion spinel (used extensively in \\"birthstone\\" jewelry), as both of the former absorb the red portion of the spectrum and the synthetic spinel did not.GemologyOnline.com ==See also== * Infrared filter * Optical filter ==ReferencesExternal links== * Chelsea Filter - Gemstone Buzz uses, procedure & precautions. * Instructions for Chelsea Filter * MineralLab & other type of filters Category:Gemology Category:Optical filters ","title":"Chelsea filter"},{"id":"5601262","text":"Malcolm Malik Mackey (born July 11, 1970) is a retired American professional basketball player who was selected by the Phoenix Suns in the first round (27th pick overall) of the 1993 NBA draft.

The theatre's opening was ill-fated, and it was little used for a decade. It changed its name twice and was used by an opera company, amateur drama companies and for French pieces. In 1861, it was renamed the New Royalty Theatre, and the next year it was leased by Mrs Charles Selby, who enlarged it from 200 seats to about 650. The theatre continued to change hands frequently. In the 1860s, it featured F. C. Burnand's burlesque of Black-Eyed Susan, which ran for nearly 500 nights, and a burlesque by W. S. Gilbert, The Merry Zingara. The theatre was managed by Henrietta Hodson during the early 1870s, who also produced mostly burlesques and comedies, including Gilbert's The Realm of Joy and Ought We to Visit Her? On 25 March 1875 the Royalty, under the direction of Selina Dolaro, enjoyed an historic success with Trial by Jury. In 1877, Kate Santley took control of the theatre, running it for nearly 30 years. She had the theatre rebuilt and it reopened in 1883. In this period, it featured opera-bouffes adapted from the French. M. L. Mayer and plays in French. It was increasingly hard for the theatre to compete with larger new London theatres. In 1891, the theatre started a policy of modern drama, presenting plays by Ibsen and George Bernard Shaw. When the theatre finally had a great success, with Charley's Aunt in 1892, its popularity led to its transference after only a month to a larger theatre. In 1895‚Äì96 the theatre underwent another renovation. Arthur Bourchier's The Chili Widow ran for over 300 nights. In the new century, Mrs Patrick Campbell played at the theatre. After another renovation in 1906, Sarah Bernhardt led her own company in a season. In 1912, Milestones, by Arnold Bennett and Edward Knoblauch had over 600 performances. The Man Who Stayed at Home played for 584 performances. The Co-Optimists played at the theatre after the war as did No√´l Coward's The Vortex. In 1932, While Parents Sleep was a hit. The theatre closed in 1938 and was demolished in 1953. ==Origins== The actress Frances Maria \\"Fanny\\" Kelly (1790‚Äì1882), used the fortune saved from her highly popular career to establish a dramatic academy with a 200-seat theatre attached.An earlier theatre, also named the Royalty, existed in Wells Street, Wellclose Square, London from 1787 until the early part of the nineteenth century. See Wilmot-Buxton, Harry John. \\"William Clarkson Stanfield\\", Chapter IX, English Painters, Sampson Low, Marston, Searle & Rivington (1883), accessed 22 November 2013 The architect of the theatre was Samuel Beazley. The theatre and school were completed in 1837.The Pitt Estate in Dean Street: The Royalty Theatre, Survey of London: volumes 33 and 34: St Anne Soho (1966), pp. 215-21 accessed: 23 March 2007 Kelley's engineer friend, Rowland Macdonald Stephenson, persuaded her to build into the theatre new machinery that he had invented to move the stage and scenery; theoretically a significant step forward in theatre technology.Ellacott, Vivyan. \\"An A-Z Encyclopaedia of London Theatres and Music Halls\\", Over the Footlights, accessed 16 October 2014 It took more than two years to install the machinery in the theatre. The theatre was \\"obscurely sited [and] perilously combustible\\", but it had \\"a relatively spacious stage, and Beazley's work in the auditorium was thought pretty.\\" The Times described the fashionable little theatre as \\"most elegantly fitted up and appointed, and painted in a light tasteful manner.\\"The Times, 27 May 1840 It turned out that the machinery was too heavy to be worked by people, and Stephenson had to use a horse. On the opening night, 25 May 1840, three pieces were presented: Summer and Winter, by Morris Barnett; a melodrama, The Sergeant's Wife; and a farce, The Midnight Hour. The opening was unsuccessful, and within a week the theatre was closed. Kelly's high admission charges of five or seven shillings did not help, but the main problem was that the tramping of the horse and the roar of the machinery drowned out the voices of the actors and caused the building to vibrate. The theatre had to be demolished to remove the machinery. After it was rebuilt, Kelly reopened the theatre in February 1841, at reduced prices, for a season of her own monologues, but then became ill. She sought to lease the theatre, but it was empty for long periods and was used mostly for amateur productions, including one of Charles Dickens's productions. Within a decade, Kelly had lost her entire fortune and was evicted from the property. In January 1850 the theatre was reopened as the Royal Soho Theatre, after redecoration by W. W. Deane and S. J. Nicholl, changing its name to the New English Opera House from November 1850, and in the following year an entrance portico was built. Various types of productions played at the theatre, including English Grand Opera. Performances were mostly by amateurs, hiring the theatre at standard rates. At other times, as the Theatre Fran√ßais, it attracted patrons chiefly among the foreigners in Soho. Ellen Terry at 16 in 1864. In 1861, the direction of the theatre was assumed by Albina di Rhona, a Serbian ballerina and comic actress. She renamed it the New Royalty Theatre, and had it altered and redecorated by \\"M. Bulot, of Paris, Decorator in Ordinary to his Imperial Majesty, Louis Napoleon\\", with \\"cut-glass lustres, painted panels, blue satin draperies and gold mouldings\\". In the opening programme, di Rhona danced, the leader of the Boston Brass Band from America played a bugle solo, and a melodrama, Atar Gull, was performed, with a 14-year-old Ellen Terry in the cast. Still, the reopening was not a success. In 1862, the theatre was leased by, Mrs Charles Selby, who also ran an acting school. She enlarged the original theatre to accommodate about 650 people. She used it to showcase her pupils and occasionally rented it to others. The theatre continued to change hands frequently. It was managed, from 1866 to 1870, by Martha Cranmer Oliver, who featured mostly burlesques, including F. C. Burnand's burlesque of Black-Eyed Susan, which ran for nearly 500 nights, and a burlesque by W. S. Gilbert, The Merry Zingara. The theatre was managed by Henrietta Hodson during the early 1870s. She also produced mostly burlesques and comedies, including Gilbert's The Realm of Joy and Ought We to Visit her? In 1872, it became known as the Royalty Theatre and retained this name (although it was occasionally known as the New Royalty Theatre). On 25 March 1875 the theatre, under the direction of Madame Selina Dolaro, enjoyed an historic success with Trial by Jury, the first Gilbert and Sullivan opera produced by Richard D'Oyly Carte. It premiered together with Jacques Offenbach's La P√©richole and another one-act farce, Cryptoconchoidsyphonostomata. Carte soon moved his Gilbert and Sullivan company to another theatre. In January 1876 at the Royalty, Pauline Rita appeared under Carte's management as Gustave Muller in The Duke's Daughter.Stone, David. Pauline Rita at Who was Who in the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, 27 August 2001, accessed 7 June 2009. ==The Santley years== In 1877, Kate Santley \\"seems to have acquired the head lease.\\" She controlled the theatre for nearly 30 years. Carte joined forces with Santley in January 1877 to present Lischen and Fritzen, Jacques Offenbach‚Äôs Orpheus in the Underworld, and Carte's own operetta, Happy Hampstead written with his secretary, Frank Desprez. Later that year, the First Chief Officer of the London Fire Brigade strongly recommended that the theatre be closed. Santley had the theatre rebuilt, hiring architect Thomas Verity, who provided additional exits, and it reopened in 1883, with Santley receiving praise for the renovations. Many of the productions in these years were opera-bouffes adapted from the French. M. L. Mayer, formerly of the Gaiety Theatre, staged twice-yearly seasons of plays in French. The Coquelins and other luminaries of the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise appeared here in the 1880s, when the Royalty was 'the recognized home of the Parisian drama.' The opening of Shaftesbury Avenue and of larger new theatres in that neighbourhood, including the Lyric Theatre and the Apollo Theatre, drew audiences away from the Royalty, and in the 1890s the Royalty was not prospering. Mrs Patrick Campbell In 1891, the theatre started a policy of modern drama. Ibsen's Ghosts premi√®red, to predictable outrage, at the theatre, in a single private London performance on 13 March 1891. The Lord Chamberlain's Office censorship was avoided by the formation of a subscription-only Independent Theatre Society, which included Thomas Hardy and Henry James among its members.Theatreland Timeline (London Metropolitan Archives) accessed 11 October 2007 Again, for the Society, George Bernard Shaw premi√®red Widowers' Houses, his first play, here the following year.The Independent Theatre (A Glimpse of Theatre History), accessed 15 January 2009 When the theatre finally had a great success, with Brandon Thomas‚Äôs play Charley's Aunt in 1892, its popularity led to its transference after only a month to the larger Globe Theatre. In 1895‚Äì96 the Royalty's manager was Arthur Bourchier, and the theatre underwent another renovation, by architect Walter Emden. Bourchier produced, among other plays, The Chili Widow, an adaptation of his own that ran for over 300 nights. In 1899, the first production of the Incorporated Stage Society took place with the first performance of Shaw's You Never Can Tell. In 1900‚Äì01 Mrs Patrick Campbell hired the theatre and staged a succession of contemporary plays in which she starred, and in 1903‚Äì04 Hans Andresen and Max Behrend presented a successful season of German theatre. Also in 1904, the newly founded Irish National Theatre Society gave plays by W. B. Yeats and, in 1905, it presented an early performance of Synge's first play, The Shadow of the Glen. In addition, Philip Carr's Mermaid Society produced Elizabethan and Jacobean plays. ==Later years== Again, the theatre was threatened with closure by the authorities, but Santley had it rebuilt again in 1906 to meet safety requirements. After redecoration in French Regency style, which increased the capacity of the theatre to 657 seats, the Royalty reopened on 4 January 1906 with a season of Theatre Fran√ßais directed by Gaston Mayer. Sarah Bernhardt led her own company in La Tosca, Phedre and La Dame aux Camelias in 1907. In 1911, J. E. Vedrenne and Dennis Eadie acquired the theatre, and in 1912, they staged Milestones, by Arnold Bennett and Edward Knoblauch (later Knoblock), which had over 600 performances. Owen Nares, Gladys Cooper and Lynn Fontanne appeared at the theatre early in their careers. The Man Who Stayed at Home was a hit at the Royalty in 1914, playing for 584 performances. Henry Daniell starred as Bobby Gilmour in The Man from Toronto at the theatre in May 1918. A post-war success was the concert-party entertainment, The Co-Optimists, first staged in 1921. The year 1924 saw the first West End production at the theatre of No√´l Coward's The Vortex. Juno and the Paycock was mounted in 1925, and Ibsen's Pillars of Society played in 1926. Another hit for the Royalty was in 1932 with While Parents Sleep. By 1936 the danger of fire from celluloid stores and other adjacent properties overrided the argument made to the Lord Chamberlain that the theatre had been on the site before the development of the inflammatory trades nearby. J. B. Priestley's I Have Been Here Before was the theatre's last success. The last performance was given at a matinee on 25 November 1938, by the Southern Cross Players. Although several schemes were considered for its rebuilding, but with the growing threat of war, the theatre remained empty and soon became derelict. It was damaged in the World War II Blitz. The Royalty was demolished in 1953 and a block of offices, Royalty House, was erected on the site. A modern Royalty Theatre was opened in the basement of an office block at Portugal Street near Aldwych in 1960. This was bought by the London School of Economics and renamed the Peacock Theatre in 1996. It is a lecture hall by day and a venue for the Sadler's Wells Theatre company by night. File:London.

Located on 31st Street between Astoria Boulevard and the Grand Central Parkway (Interstate 278) in Astoria, Queens, the station is served by the N train at all times, as well as by the W train on weekdays. ==History== alt= View of station from RFK Bridge This station opened on February 1, 1917, along with the rest of the Astoria Line, which was originally part of the IRT, as a spur off the IRT Queensboro Line, now the IRT Flushing Line. Trains ran between Grand Central and Astoria. On July 23, 1917, the Queensboro Bridge spur of the elevated IRT Second Avenue Line opened. At that time, all elevated trains to Queensboro Plaza used the Astoria Line while all subway trains used the Corona Line, though this was later changed with trains alternating between branches. This station started to be served by BMT shuttles using elevated cars on April 8, 1923. On October 17, 1949, the Astoria Line became BMT-only as the tracks at Queensboro Plaza were consolidated and the platforms on the Astoria Line were shaved back to allow through BMT trains to operate on it. Service was initially provided by the Brighton Local (BMT 1) weekdays and the Broadway - Fourth Avenue Local (BMT 2) at all times. The platforms at this station, along with six others on the Astoria Line, were lengthened to to accommodate ten-car trains in 1950. The project cost $863,000. Signals on the line had to be modified to take into account the platform extensions. On the morning of May 1, 1998, a backhoe working underneath the station (not performing New York City Transit-related work) struck the mezzanine, ripping out three support beams while damaging four more and creating a huge hole in the floor. There were no injuries, but trains bypassed the station at restricted speed. Cleanup work began immediately and by noon, the slow speed restriction was removed. By 3:00 p.m., a temporary wooden floor was installed. Less than eight hours from the time of the first response, the station was back in full service. Permanent repairs were made overnight. As part of the 2015-2019 MTA Capital Program, elevators will be added to the platforms and street, which would make the station fully compliant with accessibility guidelines under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. A contract for the elevators' construction was awarded in June 2018, and substantial completion is projected for November 2020. In September 2018, work began make the station compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act. Two elevators connect the street with the mezzanine, and two other elevators connect the mezzanine with the two platforms. In order to construct the street elevators, the station mezzanine was demolished and rebuilt. The new mezzanine was raised to reduce strikes by trucks driving underneath. The station was fully closed for nine months on March 17, 2019, so the mezzanine could be replaced. The station was reopened on December 18, 2019, while elevator construction and installation was still underway. On July 24, 2020, the elevators were placed into operation, making the station ADA accessible. ==Station layout== { cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"3\\"  rowspan=\\"5\\" style=\\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\\" valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"50\\" P Platforms  style=\\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\\" width=\\"100\\" Southbound local  style=\\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\\" width=\\"500\\"  ‚Üê toward Coney Island (30th Avenue) ‚Üê toward Whitehall Street‚ÄìSouth Ferry (weekdays) (30th Avenue) -  colspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"border-top:solid 2px black;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 2px black;text- align:center;\\" Island platform, doors will open on the left - Peak- direction express ‚Üê No regular service (No service: Queensboro Plaza southbound or Astoria‚ÄìDitmars Boulevard northbound) -  colspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"border-top:solid 2px black;border- right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 2px black;text-align:center;\\" Island platform, doors will open on the left - Northbound local ‚Üí ( weekdays) toward Astoria‚ÄìDitmars Boulevard () ‚Üí -  style=\\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-bottom:solid 0px gray;\\" valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"50\\" M  style=\\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-bottom:solid 0px gray;\\" valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"100\\" Mezzanine  style=\\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-bottom:solid 0px gray;\\" valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"500\\" to entrances/exits, station agent, MetroCard vending machines -  style=\\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\\" valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"50\\" G  style=\\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border- bottom:solid 1px gray;\\" valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"100\\" Street Level  style=\\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\\" valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"500\\" Entrances/Exits } Newly commissioned artwork from MTA Arts & Design by MacArthur Fellow Jeffrey Gibson. The glass artwork is called \\"I AM A RAINBOW TOO\\". The elevated station has three tracks and two island platforms. The center track is not used in revenue service, but it had been used regularly as recently as 2002. The station has wooden canopies with transite and wooden mezzanines. The northbound platform's benches are surrounded by low windscreen on three sides. The southbound platform bears the tertiary name of Columbus Square, for a small park containing a statue of Columbus by Angelo Racioppi immediately east of the southeastern stair of the station. It also has an enclosed waiting area. Exits There are four exits to the station: two to either northern corner of Hoyt Avenue North and 31st Street (via overpass), and two to either southern corner of Hoyt Avenue South and 31st Street. The stair to the northwest corner of Hoyt Avenue North and 31st Street was demolished and reconstructed to run parallel to Hoyt Avenue instead of 31st Street; the stair's original orientation was replaced with an elevator. This station affords a view of the Hell Gate Bridge and viaduct to the north, Triborough Bridge to the west, and the Grand Central Parkway (Interstate 278) and Hoyt Avenue underneath. The latter two structures forced a change in the station's original design. The overpass to the far north exit was added during the Triborough Bridge's construction in the 1930s. The parkway's subsequent construction forced the relocation of the north exit stairways since the parkway was too wide for the original stairways. The southern stairways date to the station's opening in 1917. The mezzanine has separate turnstile banks from each side with crossunders from the platform stairs. == References  External links == * * Station Reporter ‚Äî N Train * Astoria Boulevard entrance from Google Maps Street View * Hoyt Avenue entrance from Google Maps Street View * Platforms from Google Maps Street View Category:BMT Astoria Line stations Category:New York City Subway stations in Queens, New York Category:New York City Subway stations located aboveground Category:Railway stations in the United States opened in 1917 Category:Astoria, Queens Category:1917 establishments in New York (state) ","title":"Astoria Boulevard station"},{"id":"5601321","text":"Martin Heidegger circa 1960 Philosopher Martin Heidegger joined the Nazi Party (NSDAP) on May 1, 1933, ten days after being elected Rector of the University of Freiburg. A year later, in April 1934, he resigned the Rectorship and stopped taking part in Nazi Party meetings, but remained a member of the Nazi Party until its dismantling at the end of World War II. The denazification hearings immediately after World War II led to Heidegger's dismissal from Freiburg, banning him from teaching. In 1949, after several years of investigation, the French military finally classified Heidegger as a Mitl√§uferMitl√§ufer (literally, \\"with-runner\\"; similar to \\"lemming-like\\"): a person who, unlike a fellow traveler, gives into peer pressure without participation nor resistance nor inner conviction. or \\"fellow traveller.\\"Daniel Morat: Von der Tat zur Gelassenheit. G√∂ttingen 2007, p. 302. Helmuth Vetter: Grundriss Heidegger. Ein Handbuch zu Leben und Werk. Felix Meiner, Hamburg 2014, p. 398. The teaching ban was lifted in 1951, and Heidegger was granted emeritus status in 1953; however, he was never allowed to resume his philosophy chairmanship. Heidegger's involvement with Nazism, his attitude towards Jews and his near-total silence about the Holocaust in his writing and teaching after 1945 are highly controversial. The Black Notebooks, written between 1931 and 1941, contain several anti-semitic statements. After 1945, Heidegger never published anything about the Holocaust or the extermination camps, and made one sole verbal mention of them, in 1949, whose meaning is disputed among scholars. Heidegger never apologized for anything and is only known to have expressed regret once, privately, when he described his rectorship and the related political engagement as \\"the greatest stupidity of his life\\" (\\"die gr√∂√üte Dummheit seines Lebens\\").Heinrich Wiegand Petzet Encounters and Dialogues with Martin Heidegger, 1929‚Äì1976, 1983 p. 37. See also Fr√©d√©ric de Towarnicki, A la rencontre de Heidegger. Souvenirs d'un messager de la For√™t-Noire, Gallimard 1993 p. 125. Whether there is a relation between Heidegger's political affiliation and his philosophy is another matter of controversy. Critics, such as G√ºnther Anders, J√ºrgen Habermas, Theodor Adorno, Hans Jonas, Karl L√∂with,Karl L√∂with, Mein Leben in Deutschland vor und nach 1933: ein Bericht (Stuttgart: Metzler, 1986), p. 57, translated by Paula Wissing as cited by Maurice Blanchot in \\"Thinking the Apocalypse: a Letter from Maurice Blanchot to Catherine David\\", in Critical Inquiry 15:2, pp. 476‚Äì477. Pierre Bourdieu, Maurice Blanchot, Emmanuel Levinas,\\"Martin Heidegger, Emmanuel Levinas, and the Politics of Dwelling\\" by David J. Gauthier, Ph.D. dissertation, Louisiana State University, 2004, p. 156 Luc Ferry, Jacques Ellul, and Alain Renaut claim that Heidegger's affiliation with the Nazi Party revealed flaws inherent in his philosophical conceptions. His supporters, such as Hannah Arendt, Otto P√∂ggeler, Jan Patocka, Silvio Vietta, Jacques Derrida, Jean Beaufret, Jean-Michel Palmier, Richard Rorty, Marcel Conche, Julian Young, Catherine Malabou, and Fran√ßois F√©dier, see his involvement with Nazism as a personal \\"error\\"a word which Arendt placed in quotation marks when referring to Heidegger's Nazi-era politics that is irrelevant to his philosophy. == Timeline ==  Heidegger's rectorate at the University of Freiburg  The University of Freiburg, where Heidegger was Rector from April 21, 1933, to April 23, 1934. Adolf Hitler was sworn in as Chancellor of Germany on January 30, 1933. Heidegger was elected rector of the University of Freiburg on April 21, 1933, on the recommendation of his predecessor von M√∂llendorff, who was forced to give up his position because he had refused to display an anti-Jewish poster, and assumed the position the following day. He joined the \\"National Socialist German Workers' Party\\" ten days later, on May 1 (significantly the international day of workers' solidarity: Heidegger said after the war he supported the social more than the nationalSpiegel-Interview, GA 16 p. 655). He co-signed a public telegram sent by Nazi rectors to Hitler on May 20, 1933. Otto P√∂ggeler puts this attitude into perspective: > He wasn't alone to be mystified. Toynbee too after an audience in 1936 noted > about Hitler: \\"he has beautiful hands\\". (...) Mein Kampf had hardly been > read and absolutely not taken seriously. (...) Roosevelt was impressed by > Hitler's manners, the Times in London supported Hitler's demands, and as a > result of high stock exchange prices, people applauded in London's cinemas > when the newsreel showed Hitler's image.Otto P√∂ggeler, Neue Wege mit > Heidegger, Karl Alber, Freiburg, 1992 p.248 In Germany, the atmosphere of those days has been described by Sebastian Haffner, who experienced it himself, as \\"a widespread feeling of deliverance, of liberation from democracy.\\"quoted by R.Safranski Martin Heidegger: Between Good and Evil Harvard p.229 R√ºdiger Safranski explains: > This sense of relief at the demise of democracy was shared not only by the > enemies of the republic. Most of its supporters, too, no longer credited it > with the strength to master the crisis. It was as if a paralyzing weight had > been lifted. Something genuinely new seemed to be beginning ‚Äî a people's > rule without political parties, with a leader of whom it was hoped that he > would unite Germany once more internally and make her self-assured > externally. (...) Hitler's \\"Peace Speech\\" of May 17, 1933, when he declared > that \\"boundless love and loyalty to one's own nation\\" included \\"respect\\" for > the national rights of other nations, had its effect.

Georg Picht > recalls that Eugen Rosenstock-Huessy, in a lecture in March 1933, declared > that the National Socialist revolution was an attempt by the Germans to > realize H√∂lderlin's dream. (...) Heidegger was indeed captivated by Hitler > in this first year. Jaspers noted about his last meeting with him in May 1933: \\"It's just like 1914, again this deceptive mass intoxication.\\" The new rector Heidegger was sober enough to refuse, like his predecessor, to display the anti-Jewish poster. He argued after the war that he joined the Party to avoid dismissal, and he forbade the planned book-burning that was scheduled to take place in front of the main University building. Nevertheless, according to Victor Farias, Hugo Ott, and Emmanuel Faye, Heidegger implemented the Gleichschaltung totalitarian policy, suppressing all opposition to the government. Faye [pp. 40‚Äì46] details precisely Heidegger's actions in implementing anti-Semitic legislation within Freiburg University. Along with Ernst Krieck and Alfred Baeumler, Heidegger spearheaded the Conservative Revolution promoted (in the beginning) by the Nazis. But according to others such as Fran√ßois F√©dier and Julian Young, Heidegger \\"called for, not the subordination of the university to the state, but precisely the reverse\\", and \\"did indeed seek to protect students from indoctrination by the crasser form of Nazi propaganda\\".Julian Young Heidegger, Philosophy, Nazism Cambridge University Press 1997 p.20 Young quotes the testimony of a former student, Georg Picht: > The way Heidegger conceived of the revival of the university, this became > clear to me on the occasion of a memorable event. To give the first lecture > within the framework of \\"political education\\" a compulsory measure > introduced at the universities by the Nazis (...) ‚Äì Heidegger, rector at > that time, invited my mother's brother in law, Viktor von Weizs√§cker. > Everyone was puzzled, because it was well-known that Weizs√§cker was no Nazi. > But Heidegger's word was law.

Heidegger soon manifested signs of > impatience, then he shouted with a loud voice that irritation strained: > \\"this jabber will stop immediately!\\" Totally prostrated, the student > disappeared from the tribune. He had to resign from office. As for Victor > von Weizs√§cker, he gave a perfect lecture on his philosophy of medicine, in > which national socialism was not once mentioned, but far rather Sigmund > Freud.Georg Picht \\"Macht des Denkens\\" in Erinnerung an Martin Heidegger > Neske, Pfullingen, 1977, p. 198, cited by Julian Young in Heidegger, > Philosophy, Nazism Cambridge University Press 1997 p.20, F√©dier Heidegger √† > plus forte raison p.44. Picht recalls his uncle Weizs√§cker told him afterwards about Heidegger's political engagement: > I'm pretty sure it's a misunderstandingsuch a thing happens often in history > of philosophy. But Heidegger is a step ahead: he perceives something is > going on that the others don't. Georg Picht \\"Die Macht des Denkens\\" in > Erinnerung an Martin Heidegger Neske, Pfullingen, 1977, p.198. Heidegger's tenure as rector was fraught with difficulties. He was in conflict with Nazi students, intellectuals, and bureaucrats. Philosophical historian Hans Sluga wrote: > Though as rector he prevented students from displaying an anti-Semitic > poster at the entrance to the university and from holding a book burning, he > kept in close contact with the Nazi student leaders and clearly signaled to > them his sympathy with their activism.Hans Sluga, Heidegger's Crisis: > Philosophy and Politics in Nazi Germany (Cambridge, Massachusetts, & London: > Harvard University Press, 1993), p.149. Some Nazi education officials viewed also him as a rival, while others saw his efforts as comical. His most risible initiative was the creation of a Wissenschaftslager or Scholar's camp, seriously described by Rockmore as a \\"reeducation camp\\", but by Safranski as rather a \\"mixture of scout camp and Platonic academy\\", actually \\"to build campfires, share food, have conversation, sing along with guitar... with people who were really a little beyond Cub Scout age\\". Safranski tells how a dispute occurred with a group of SA students and their military spirit.Rudiger Safranski, Martin Heidegger: Between Good and Evil Harvard 2002 p.262 Some of Heidegger's fellow Nazis also ridiculed his philosophical writings as gibberish. He finally offered his resignation on April 23, 1934, and it was accepted on April 27. Heidegger remained a member of both the academic faculty and of the Nazi Party until the end of the war, but took no part in Party meetings. In 1944, he didn't even have the right to teach anymore, was considered a \\"completely dispensable\\" teacher, and was ordered up the Rhine to build fortifications, then drafted into the Volkssturm national militia, \\"the oldest member of the faculty to be called up\\". In 1945 Heidegger wrote of his term as rector, giving the writing to his son Hermann; it was published in 1983: > The rectorate was an attempt to see something in the movement that had come > to power, beyond all its failings and crudeness, that was much more far- > reaching and that could perhaps one day bring a concentration on the > Germans' Western historical essence. It will in no way be denied that at the > time I believed in such possibilities and for that reason renounced the > actual vocation of thinking in favor of being effective in an official > capacity. In no way will what was caused by my own inadequacy in office be > played down. But these points of view do not capture what is essential and > what moved me to accept the rectorate.Heidegger, \\"The Rectorate 1933/34: > Facts and Thoughts\\", in G√ºnther Neske & Emil Kettering (eds.), Martin > Heidegger and National Socialism: Questions and Answers (New York: Paragon > House, 1990), p. 29. Inaugural address Heidegger's inaugural address as rector of Freiburg, the \\"Rektoratsrede\\", was entitled \\"The Self-Assertion of the German University\\" (\\"Die Selbstbehauptung der deutschen Universit√§t\\").M. Heidegger, \\"The Self-Assertion of the German University\\" Rectoral address at the University of Freiburg, 1933 (original German ). English version translated by Karston Harries, Review of Metaphysics 38 (March 1985): pp. 467‚Äì502. See also G. Neske and E. Kettering (eds), Martin Heidegger and National Socialism, New York: Paragon House, 1990, pp. 5‚Äì13; see also R. Wolin, ed., The Heidegger Controversy (MIT Press, 1993). This speech has become notorious as a visible endorsement of Nazism by Heidegger, giving the blessing of his philosophy to the new political party. However, philosopher Jacques Taminiaux writes that \\"it is to admit that the rectorate speech do[es] not tally at all with the Nazi ideology\\",Jacques Taminiaux, Art et √©v√©nement : sp√©culation et jugement des Grecs √† Heidegger, Paris, Belin, \\"L‚Äôextr√™me contemporain\\", 2005. p. 9 sqq. and Eduard Langwald calls it even a \\"challenge to Hitlerism\\" or an \\"anti-Mein- Kampf-address\\", for Heidegger refers to Plato instead of Hitler (who is not mentioned) and, above all, puts limits on the Nazi leader-principle (F√ºhrerprinzip): > All leading must concede its following its own strength. All following, > however, bears resistance in itself. This essential opposition of leading > and following must not be blurred let alone eliminated. In this speech, Heidegger declared that \\"science must become the power that shapes the body of the German university.\\" But by \\"science\\" he meant \\"the primordial and full essence of science\\", which he defined as \\"engaged knowledge about the people and about the destiny of the state that keeps itself in readiness [...] at one with the spiritual mission.\\" He went on to link this concept of \\"science\\" with a historical struggle of the German people: > The will to the essence of the German university is the will to science as > will to the historical spiritual mission of the German people as a people > [\\"Volk\\"] that knows itself in its state [\\"Staat\\"]. Together, science and > German destiny must come to power in the will to essence. And they will do > so and only will do so, if weteachers and studentson the one hand, expose > science to its innermost necessity and, on the other hand, are able to stand > our ground while German destiny is in its most extreme distress. Heidegger also linked the concept of a people with \\"blood and soil\\" in a way that would now be regarded as characteristic of Nazism: > The spiritual world of a people is not the superstructure of a culture any > more than it is an armory filled with useful information and values; it is > the power that most deeply preserves the people‚Äôs earth- and blood-bound > strengths as the power that most deeply arouses and most profoundly shakes > the people‚Äôs existence. Fran√ßois F√©dier and Beda Allemann argue, however, that this topic was not at that time specifically Nazi.Fran√ßois F√©dier, Heidegger √† plus forte raison Fayard 2006 p.78. And Beda Allemann, \\"Heidegger und die Politik\\", in Heidegger: Perspektiven zur Deutung seines Werks, P√∂ggeler (ed.), Beltz Athen√§um 1994, S.258 For instance, Austrian-born Israeli philosopher Martin Buber said in 1911: \\"Blood is the deepest power stratum of the soul\\" (Three addresses on Judaism). In 1936, anti-fascist poet Antonin Artaud wrote that \\"Any true culture is based on race and blood.\\" Moreover, the 1933‚Äì34 lecture course \\"On the Essence of Truth\\" contains a clear note of dissent against \\"blood and soil\\" as the sole requirement for Dasein: > There is much talk nowadays of blood and soil as frequently invoked powers. > Literati, whom one comes across even today, have already seized hold of > them. Blood and soil are certainly powerful and necessary, but they are not > a sufficient condition for the Dasein of a people.Sein und Wahrheit, GA > II/36/37, Freiburger Vorlesungen Sommersemester 1933 und Wintersemester > 1933‚Äì34, Klostermann, Frankfurt/M. 2001, p.263. Heidegger's concept of a people is \\"historical\\" and not only biological as in Alfred Rosenberg, the Nazi Party's chief racial theorist. In his 1941‚Äì42 lecture course on H√∂lderlin's poem \\"Andenken\\", Heidegger contends that a people finding itself only in skull measurements and archaeological digs is unable to find itself as a people.Quoted in James Phillips, Heidegger's Volk: Between National Socialism And Poetry, Stanford University Press 2005, p.20 The rectorate speech ended with calls for the German people to \\"will itself\\" and \\"fulfill its historical mission\\": Speech to Heidelberg Student Association In June 1933, Heidegger gave a speech to the Student Association at the University of Heidelberg in which he gave clear form to his platonian views on the need for the university \\"to educate the State‚Äôs leaders\\", in the spirit of the Plato's quote ending the Rectorate speech with \\"All that is great stands in the storm\\" (Republic 497d9), but also \\"in the National Socialist spirit\\" and free from \\"humanizing, Christian ideas\\":Martin Heidegger, ‚ÄúThe University in the New Reich‚Äù, speech given on June 30, 1933. English translation in Richard Wolin, The Heidegger Controversy: A Critical Reader, ed. Richard Wolin, Cambridge: MIT Press, 1998, pp. 44‚Äì45 Denounced or demoted non-Nazis Hermann Staudinger According to Farias and Ott, Heidegger also denounced or demoted three colleagues for being insufficiently committed to the Nazi cause. But this has been disputed by Eduard Langwald, who considers \\"Heidegger was never a Nazi-minded informer\\". Langwald, Eduard (2004). P. 197. \\"Heidegger nie ein Denunziant aus nazistischer Gesinnung war.\\" According to Hugo Ott, Heidegger leaked information on September 29, 1933 to the local minister of education that the chemist Hermann Staudinger had been a pacifist during World War I. Staudinger was a Professor of chemistry at Freiburg, and had developed the theory that polymers were long chain molecule, a theory confirmed by later work and for which Staudinger received the Nobel Prize in 1953. Heidegger knew that the allegation of pacifism could cost Staudinger his job. The Gestapo investigated the matter and confirmed Heidegger's tip. Asked for his recommendation as rector of the university, Heidegger secretly urged the ministry to fire Staudinger without a pension. But nothing eventually happened. As Langwald alleges Heidegger was himself a pacifist since World War I, he doubts that Heidegger could so suddenly become a \\"pacifist hunter\\" acting \\"furiously macho\\", Langwald, Eduard (2004). P. 195. \\"alten Krieger vielleicht friedlich stimmend einwirken k√∂nnen [...] blindw√ºtiger Macho.\\" and asserts Ott did not interpret the facts properly. After Hitler's \\"Peace Speech\\" of May 17, 1933, Heidegger more likely wanted to test Staudinger, because as a chemist his researches could become dangerous. Safranski, although he charges Heidegger, recognizes: \\"It is likely that Heidegger [...] may not even have viewed his action as a denunciation. He felt he was a part of the revolutionary movement, and it was his intention to keep opportunists away from the revolutionary awakening. They were not to be allowed to sneak into the movement and use it to their advantage.\\"R.Safranski Martin Heidegger: Between Good and Evil Harvard p.275. Heidegger in the same spirit denounced his former friend Eduard Baumgarten in a letter to the head of the organization of Nazi professors at the University of G√∂ttingen, where Baumgarten had been teaching. He intervened as Baumgarten applied for membership in the SA brownshirts and in the National Socialist Dozentenschaft. In the letter, Heidegger called Baumgarten \\"anything but a National-Socialist\\" and underlined his links to \\"the Heidelberg circle of liberal-democratic intellectuals around Max Weber.\\" But he failed and the opportunistic Baumgarten continued in his career ‚Äì with the help of the Party.R.Safranski Martin Heidegger: Between Good and Evil Harvard p.272 Langwald thinks Heidegger considered Baumgarten as a dangerous pragmatist who could give philosophical weapons to the NS-ideologie. The Catholic intellectual Max M√ºller was a member of the inner circle of Heidegger's most gifted students from 1928 to 1933. But M√ºller stopped attending Heidegger's lectures when Heidegger joined the Nazi party in May 1933. Seven months later, Heidegger fired M√ºller from his position as a student leader because M√ºller was \\"not politically appropriate.\\" Then in 1938 M√ºller discovered that Heidegger had blocked him from getting a teaching position at Freiburg by informing the university administration that M√ºller was \\"unfavorably disposed\\" toward the regime. Langwald thinks that Heidegger had really no choice but to fire him from his position, as M√ºller showed too publicly that he was indeed more than \\"not politically appropriate\\". Heidegger also fired a Nazi student leader because he was this time too favorably disposed toward the regime (see Picht's testimony). Attitude towards Jews On November 3, 1933, Heidegger issued a decree applying the Nazi racial policies to the students of Freiburg university. These laws meant that Jews were now indirectly and directly dissuaded or banned from privileged and superior positions reserved for \\"Aryan Germans.\\" Heidegger announced that economic aid would henceforth be awarded to students who belonged to the SS, the SA, or other military groups but would be denied to \\"Jewish or Marxist students\\" or anyone who fit the description of a \\"non-Aryan\\" in Nazi law. After 1933, Heidegger declined to direct the doctoral dissertations of Jewish students: he sent all those students to his Catholic colleague Professor Martin Honecker. And in his letter denouncing Baumgarten, cited above, Heidegger wrote that \\"after failing with me\\" [not as a student but as a friend!], Baumgarten \\"frequented, very actively, the Jew Fr√§nkel\\"‚Äîi.e. Eduard Fr√§nkel, a noted professor of classics at Freiburg. Jaspers declared he was surprised by this expression, \\"the Jew Fr√§nkel\\", because Heidegger had never been anti-Semitic before.letter to Oehlkers, 22 December 1945 But the reason is perhaps that the only copy of this letter about Baumgarten seems actually not to have been written by Heidegger himself. Moreover, Heidegger did indeed write a \\"very impressive letter to the Education minister\\" (Hugo Ott) in July 1933, this one authentic, to defend Eduard Fr√§nkel against the new anti-Semitic law.GA 16, p.140 Heidegger intervened as rector to help several other Jewish colleagues. He wrote appeals in defense of three Jewish professors, including Fr√§nkel, all of whom were about to be fired for racial reasons. Heidegger also helped certain Jewish students and colleagues to emigrate, such as Karl L√∂with and his assistant Werner Brock, who found a position respectively in Italy and in England with Heidegger's assistance.Dermot Moran, Introduction to Phenomenology, p. 499Hugo Ott, Heidegger: A Political Life (London: Harper Collins, 1993), p. 187. There are nevertheless troubling passages from Heidegger's lecture and seminar courses from the period of the Nazi Gleichschaltung. In a passage reflecting on Heraclitus' fragment 53, \\"War is the father of all things\\", in the summer of 1933‚Äì34 after the Nazis' first round of anti-semitic legislation (including university employment and enrollment reforms), Heidegger argued in the following terms concerning the need for 'polemos' or 'Kampf' (combat, war and/or struggle) with an internal enemy: > The enemy is one who poses an essential threat to the existence of the > people and its members. The enemy is not necessarily the outside enemy, and > the outside enemy is not necessarily the most dangerous. It may even appear > that there is no enemy at all. The root requirement is then to find the > enemy, bring him to light or even to create him, so that there may be that > standing up to the enemy, and so that existence does not become apathetic. > The enemy may have grafted himself onto the innermost root of the existence > of a people, and oppose the latter‚Äôs ownmost essence, acting contrary to it. > All the keener and harsher and more difficult is then the struggle, for only > a very small part of the struggle consists in mutual blows; it is often much > harder and more exhausting to seek out the enemy as such, and to lead him to > reveal himself, to avoid nurturing illusions about him, to remain ready to > attack, to cultivate and increase constant preparedness and to initiate the > attack on a long-term basis, with the goal of total extermination [v√∂lligen > Vernichtung]. In his advanced contemporary seminars \\"On the Essence and Concept of Nature, State and History,\\" Heidegger expostulated in essentialising terms concerning \\"semitic nomads\\" and their lack of possible relation to the German homeland, \\"drifting\\" in the \\"unessence of history\\": > History teaches us that nomads did not become what they are because of the > bleakness of the desert and the steppes, but that they have even left > numerous wastelands behind them that had been fertile and cultivated land > when they arrived, and that men rooted in the soil have been able to create > for themselves a native land, even in the wilderness‚Ä¶the nature of our > German space would surely be apparent to a Slavic people in a different > manner than to us; to a Semitic nomad, it may never be apparent. Attitude towards his mentor Husserl Edmund Husserl, the man who established the school of phenomenology Beginning in 1917, the philosopher Edmund Husserl championed Heidegger's work, and helped him secure the retiring Husserl's chair in Philosophy at the University of Freiburg.Seyla Benhabib, The Reluctant Modernism Of Hannah Arendt (Rowman and Littlefield, 2003, p. 120.) On April 6, 1933, the Reichskommissar of Baden Province, Robert Wagner, suspended all Jewish government employees, including present and retired faculty at the University of Freiburg. Husserl, who was born Jewish and was an adult convert to Lutheran Christianity, was affected by this law. Heidegger did not become Rector until April 22, so it was Heidegger's predecessor as Rector who formally notified Husserl of his \\"enforced leave of absence\\" on April 14, 1933. Then, the week after Heidegger's election, the national Reich law of April 28, 1933 came into effect, overriding Wagner's decree, and requiring that all Jewish professors from German universities, including those who had converted to Christianity, be fired. The termination of Husserl's academic privileges thus did not involve any specific action on Heidegger's part.Seyla Benhabib, The Personal is not the Political (October/November 1999 issue of Boston Review.) Heidegger had by then broken off contact with Husserl, other than through intermediaries. Heidegger later claimed that his relationship with Husserl had become strained after Husserl publicly \\"settled accounts\\" with him and Max Scheler in the early 1930s.Martin Heidegger, \\"Der Spiegel Interview\\", in G√ºnther Neske & Emil Kettering (eds.), Martin Heidegger and National Socialism: Questions and Answers (New York: Paragon House, 1990), p. 48. However, in 1933 Husserl wrote to a friend, \\"The perfect conclusion to this supposed bosom friendship of two philosophers was his very public, very theatrical entrance into the Nazi Party on May 1. Prior to that there was his self-initiated break in relations with me ‚Äì in fact, soon after his appointment at Freiburg ‚Äì and, over the last few years, his anti-Semitism, which he came to express with increasing vigor ‚Äì even against the coterie of his most enthusiastic students, as well as around the department.\\"Letter to Dietrich Mahnke, 4 May 1933. In Becoming Heidegger, ed. Kisiel and Sheehan (Evanston, Illinois: Northwestern University Press, 2007), p. 413. Heidegger did not attend his former mentor's cremation in 1938. He spoke of a \\"human failure\\" and begged pardon in a letter to his wife. There is no truth to the oft-repeated story that during Heidegger's time as Rector, the University denied Husserl access to the university library. However, in 1941, under pressure from publisher Max Niemeyer, Heidegger did agree to remove the dedication to Husserl from Being and Time, but it could still be found in a footnote on page 38, thanking Husserl for his guidance and generosity. Husserl, of course, had died several years earlier. The dedication was restored in post-war editions.R√ºdiger Safranski, Martin Heidegger: Between Good and Evil (Cambridge, Mass., & London: Harvard University Press, 1998), pp. 253‚Äì8. Support for the \\"F√ºhrer principle\\" Adolf Hitler was made Chancellor of Germany in January 1933. According to Emmanuel Faye, Heidegger supported the \\"necessity of a F√ºhrer\\" for Germany as early as 1918. But Heidegger spoke actually of the \\"necessity of leaders\\" or \\"guides\\" (genitive plural: die Notwendigkeit der F√ºhrer) because \\"only individuals are creative (even to lead), the crowd never\\", which sounds more platonic than Nazi; Heidegger in the same letter17 October 1918 speaks about people who are rightly \\"appalled at the Pan-Germanic chimerae\\" after first World War. In a number of speeches during November 1933, Heidegger endorses the F√ºhrerprinzip (\\"leader principle\\"), i.e. the principle that the F√ºhrer is the embodiment of the people; that he is always right and that his word is above all written law and demands total obedience. For example, in one speech Heidegger stated: > Let not propositions and 'ideas' be the rules of your being (Sein). The > F√ºhrer alone is the present and future German reality and its law. Learn to > know ever more deeply: that from now on every single thing demands decision, > and every action responsibility. Heil Hitler!Martin Heidegger, \\"German > Students\\", a speech delivered on 3 November 1933 at Freiburg university. > English translation in R. Wolin, ed., The Heidegger Controversy (MIT Press, > 1993), chapter 2. Election banner, November 1933: \\"One People, one Leader, one 'Yes'\\" In another speech a few days later, Heidegger endorsed the German election of November 1933, in which the electorate was presented with a single Nazi-approved list of candidates: > The German people has been summoned by the F√ºhrer to vote; the F√ºhrer, > however, is asking nothing from the people; rather, he is giving the people > the possibility of making, directly, the highest free decision of all: > whether itthe entire peoplewants its own existence (Dasein), or whether it > does not want it. [...] On November 12, the German people as a whole will > choose its future, and this future is bound to the F√ºhrer. [...] There are > not separate foreign and domestic policies. There is only one will to the > full existence (Dasein) of the State. The F√ºhrer has awakened this will in > the entire people and has welded it into a single resolve.Martin Heidegger, > \\"German Men and Women!\\", a speech delivered on 10 November 1933 at Freiburg > university; printed in the Freiburger Studentenzeitung, November 10, 1933. > English translation in R. Wolin, ed., The Heidegger Controversy (MIT Press, > 1993), chapter 2. Later in November 1933, Heidegger attended a conference at the University of T√ºbingen organized by the students of the university and the Kampfbund, the local Nazi Party chapter. In this address, he argued for a revolution in knowledge, a revolution that would displace the traditional idea that the university should be independent of the state: > We have witnessed a revolution. The state has transformed itself. This > revolution was not the advent of a power pre-existing in the bosom of the > state or of a political party. The national-socialist revolution means > rather the radical transformation of German existence. [...] However, in the > university, not only has the revolution not yet achieved its aims, it has > not even started.Martin Heidegger, conference of 30 November 1933 at the > University of T√ºbingen. Cited by Victor Farias, Heidegger and Nazism > (Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 1989) Heidegger addressed some of these remarks in the 1966 Der Spiegel interview \\"Only a God Can Save Us\\" (see below). In that interview, he stated: \\"I would no longer write [such things] today. Such things as that I stopped saying by 1934.\\" In a recent book, however, Hans Jonas, a former student of Heidegger, argues that Heidegger's endorsement of the \\"F√ºhrer principle\\" stemmed from his philosophy and was consistent with it: > But as to Heidegger's being, it is an occurrence of unveiling, a fate-laden > happening upon thought: so was the F√ºhrer and the call of German destiny > under him: an unveiling of something indeed, a call of being all right, > fate-laden in every sense: neither then nor now did Heidegger's thought > provide a norm by which to decide how to answer such calls‚Äîlinguistically or > otherwise: no norm except depth, resolution, and the sheer force of being > that issues the call.Hans Jonas, \\"Heidegger and Theology\\" in The Phenomenon > of Life: Toward a Philosophical Biology (Evanston, Illinois: Northwestern > University Press, 2001), p.247. . Jonas' reading can be supported by citations from Heidegger's lectures during and immediately following the time he was rector. In \\"On the Essence and Concept of Nature, History and State\\", for instance, Heidegger appears to give a direct ontological sanction to Hitler's absolute rule: > ...The origin of all political action is not in knowledge, but in being. > Every F√ºhrer is a F√ºhrer, must be a F√ºhrer [italics in original], in > accordance with the stamp in his being, and simultaneously, in the living > unfolding of his proper essence, he understands, thinks, and puts into > action what the people and the state are. In his 1934 class on Holderlin, Heidegger is able to comment that \\"The true and only Fuhrer makes a sign in his being towards the domain [bereich, empire] of the demigods. Being the F√ºhrer is a destiny ‚Ä¶‚Äù, Resignation from rectorship In his postwar justification, Heidegger claimed he resigned the rectorship in April 1934 because the ministry in Karlsruhe had demanded the dismissal of the deans Erik Wolf and Wilhelm von Mollendorf on political grounds.M.Heidegger Das Rektorat, Tasachen und Gedanken (1945), Gesamtausgabe 16 p.388. See also Karl Moehling, \\"Heidegger and the nazis\\" in Heidegger: the man and the thinker, Thomas Sheehan ed., New Brunswick, 2010 Transaction Publishers p.37 But R√ºdiger Safransky found no trace of such events and prefers talking about a disagreement with other Party members.R√ºdiger Safranski, Martin Heidegger: Between Good and Evil, Harvard p.271 According to the historian Richard J. Evans: > By the beginning of 1934, there were reports in Berlin that Heidegger had > established himself as 'the philosopher of National Socialism'. But to other > Nazi thinkers, Heidegger's philosophy appeared too abstract, too difficult, > to be of much use [...] Though his intervention was welcomed by many Nazis, > on closer inspection such ideas did not really seem to be in tune with the > Party's. It is not surprising that his enemies were able to enlist the > support of Alfred Rosenberg, whose own ambition it was to be the philosopher > of Nazism himself. Denied a role at the national level, and increasingly > frustrated with the minutiae of academic politicswhich seemed to him to > betray a sad absence of the new spirit he had hoped would permeate the > universitiesHeidegger resigned his post in April 1934.Richard J. Evans, The > Coming of the Third Reich, Penguin Books, 2003, p.421-422  Post-rectorate period  After he resigned from the rectorship, Heidegger withdrew from most political activity but he never withdrew his membership in the Nazi party. In May 1934 he accepted a position in the Committee for the Philosophy of Justice in the Academy for German Law (Ausschu√ü f√ºr Rechtphilosophie der Akademie f√ºr Deutsches Recht), where he remained active until at least 1936.Emmanuel Faye, Heidegger. Die Einf√ºhrung des Nationalsozialismus in die Philosophie, Berlin 2009, S. 275‚Äì278 The academy had official consultant status in preparing Nazi legislation such as the Nuremberg racial laws that came into effect in 1935. In addition to Heidegger, such Nazi notables as Hans Frank, Julius Streicher, Carl Schmitt and Alfred Rosenberg belonged to the academy. References to Nazism continued to appear in Heidegger's work, always in ambiguous ways, suitably disguised for the benefit of the Gestapo spies, according to Fran√ßois F√©dier and Julian Young,Julian Young, Heidegger, Philosophy, Nazism Cambridge University Press, p.164 in order to hide his own version of Nazism, as per Emmanuel Faye. For instance, in a 1935 lecture, he publicly criticized National Socialism, but referred in passing to the \\"inner truth and greatness of this movement\\": > What today is systematically touted as the philosophy of National Socialism, > but which has nothing in the least to do with the inner truth and greatness > of this movement (namely the encounter of a globally determined technology > with the man of the new age), darts about with fish-like movements in the > murky waters of these 'values' and 'totalities'. Heidegger explained later that: > The whole lecture shows that I was at that time an adversary of the regime. > The understanding ears knew therefore how to interpret the sentence. Only > the spies of the party whoI knew itsat in my courses, understood the > sentence otherwise, as it must be. One had to throw them a crumb here and > there in order to keep freedom of teaching and speaking.Heidegger, letter to > S. Zernach, March 18th 1968. This lecture was published in 1953 under the title An Introduction to Metaphysics. In the published version, Heidegger left the sentence, but added a parenthetical qualification: \\"(namely, the confrontation of planetary technology and modern humanity)\\". However, Heidegger did not mention that this qualification was added at the time of publication, and was not part of the original lecture.Jurgen Habermas, \\"Work and Weltanschauung: the Heidegger Controversy from a German Perspective,\\" Critical Inquiry 15:2 (Winter 1989), pp. 452‚Äì254. Habermas cites a letter to himself from Rainer Marten dated January 28, 1988. This raised concerns in post-Nazi Germany that Heidegger was distinguishing a \\"good Nazism\\" from a \\"bad Nazism\\", a contention supported by his philosophical opponents, including Bauemler. The controversial page of the 1935 manuscript is missing from the Heidegger Archives in Marbach. He explained again during the Der Spiegel interview that \\"The reason I did not read that passage aloud was because I was convinced my audience would understand me correctly. The stupid ones and the spies and the snoopers understood it differentlyand might as well have, too.\\" In this same course, Heidegger criticized both Russia and the United States: \\"Seen metaphysically, Russia and America are both the same: the same desolate frenzy of unbounded technology and of the unlimited organization of the average human being.\\" He then calls Germany \\"the most metaphysical of nations.\\" This is a good example of Heidegger's ambiguous way of speaking, since his students would have known that \\"metaphysical\\" in this context is actually a synonym of \\"technological\\" and \\"nihilistic\\" and therefore a term of harsh criticism. In a 1938 lecture, he wrote \\"...the laborious fabrication of such absurd entities as National Socialist philosophies\\"Heidegger, \\"The Age of the world picture\\", in Off the Beaten Track, Cambridge UP 2002 p.75but didn't read it aloud. Heidegger defended himself during the denazification period by claiming that he had opposed the philosophical bases of Nazism, especially biologism and the Nazi interpretation of Nietzsche's The Will to Power. However, in a 1936 lecture, Heidegger still sounded rather ambiguous as to whether Nietzsche's thought was compatible with Nazism, or at least with that hypothetical \\"good Nazism\\": \\"The two men who, each in his own way, have introduced a counter movement to nihilismMussolini and Hitlerhave learned from Nietzsche, each in an essentially different way.\\" However a subtle correction followed immediately: \\"But even with that, Nietzsche's authentic metaphysical domain has not yet come unto its own.\\"Martin Heidegger, notes on a course on Schelling, text omitted from the published version of the course, but cited by Carl Ulmer in Der Spiegel (May 2, 1977), p. 10. (Cited by Sheehan, op. cit.) According to personal notes made in 1939 (not published until 2006), Heidegger took strong exception to Hitler's statement, \\"There is no attitude, which could not be ultimately justified by the ensuing usefulness for the totality.\\" Under the heading \\"Truth and Usefulness\\", Heidegger's private critique is as follows: > Who makes up this totality? (Eighty million-strong extant human mass? Does > its extantness assign to this human mass the right to the claim on a > continued existence?) How is this totality determined? What is its goal? Is > it itself the goal of all goals? Why? Wherein lies the justification for > this goal-setting? [...] Why is usefulness the criterion for the legitmacy > of a human attitude? On what is this principle grounded? [...] From where > does the appeal to usefulness as the measure of truth acquire its > comprehensibility? Does comprehensibility justify legitimacy?Martin > Heidegger, Mindfulness (Continuum, 2006), section 47. However, in a 1942 lecture, published posthumously, Heidegger was once again ambiguous on the subject of Nazism. During a discussion of then recent German classics scholarship, he said that: \\"In the majority of 'research results', the Greeks appear as pure National Socialists. This overenthusiasm on the part of academics seems not even to notice that with such \\"results\\" it does National Socialism and its historical uniqueness no service at all, not that it needs this anyhow.\\"Heidegger, H√∂lderlin's Hymn \\"The Ister\\" (Bloomington & Indianapolis: Indiana University Press, 1996), pp. 79‚Äì80. Also cited in part by Sheehan, op. cit. In the same lecture, he commented on America's entry into World War II, in a way that seems to identify his philosophy with the Nazi cause: > The entry of America into this planetary war is not an entry into history. > No, it is already the last American act of America's history-lessness and > self-destruction. This act is the renunciation of the Origin. It is a > decision for lack-of-Origin. Student testimonials Among Heidegger's students, G√ºnther Anders saw in Heidegger's lectures a \\"reactionary potential\\", and Karl L√∂with said that in Rome his master spoke enthusiastically of Hitler. However, most students who attended Heidegger's courses between 1933 and 1945 confirm that he became very soon an adversary of Nazism. Walter Biemel, Heidegger's student in 1942, testified in 1945: > Heidegger was the only professor not to give any Nazi salutations prior to > beginning his courses, even though it was administratory obligatory. His > courses... were among the very rare ones where remarks against National > Socialism were risked. Some conversations in those times could cost you your > head. I had many such conversations with Heidegger. There is absolutely no > doubt he was a declared adversary of the regime.Karl Moehling, \\"Heidegger > and the Nazis\\" in Heidegger: the man and the thinker, Thomas Sheehan ed., > New Brunswick, 2010 Transaction Publishers p.38 Siegfried Br√∂se, relieved of his functions as subprefect by the Nazis in 1933, and subsequently one of Heidegger's teaching assistants, wrote to the de- Nazification hearing: > One could seeand this was often confirmed to me by the studentsthat > Heidegger lectures were attended en masse because the students wanted to > form a rule to guide their own conduct by hearing National Socialism > characterized in all its non-truth... Heidegger's lectures were attended not > only by students but also by people with long-standing professions and even > by retired people, and every time I had the occasion to talk with these > people, what came back incessantly was their admiration for the courage with > which Heidegger, from the height of his philosophical position and in the > rigor of his starting point, attacked National Socialism.Letter to the > Rector of the University of Freiburg, 14 January 1946. Equally, Hermine Rohner, a student from 1940 to 1943, bears testimony to the fact Heidegger \\"wasn't afraid, as for him, even in front of students from all faculties (so not only \\"his\\" students), to attack National Socialism so openly that I hunched up my shoulders.\\"Published in the Badische Zeitung, 13 August 1986. Due to what he calls Heidegger's \\"spiritual resistance\\", Czech resistance fighter and former Heidegger student Jan Patocka included him among his \\"heroes of our times\\". The testimony of Karl L√∂withwho was not in Germanysounds different. He was another of Heidegger's students, aided by Heidegger in 1933 in obtaining a fellowship to study in Rome, where he lived between 1934 and 1936.Hannah Arendt and Martin Heidegger, Letters, 1925 ‚Äì 1975 (Harcourt, 2004), letter no. 45, note 3. In 1936, Heidegger visited Rome to lecture on H√∂lderlin, and had a meeting with L√∂with. In an account set down in 1940 and not intended for publication, L√∂with noted that Heidegger was wearing a swastika pin, even though he knew that L√∂with was Jewish. L√∂with recounted their discussion about editorials published in the Neue Z√ºrcher Zeitung:Karl L√∂with, \\"My last meeting with Heidegger in Rome\\", in R. Wolin, ed., The Heidegger Controversy (MIT Press, 1993). > He left no doubt about his faith in Hitler; only two things that he had > underestimated: the vitality of the Christian churches and the obstacles to > the Anschluss in Austria. Now, as before, he was convinced that National > Socialism was the prescribed path for Germany. [I] told him that [...] my > opinion was that his taking the side of National Socialism was in agreement > with the essence of his philosophy. Heidegger told me unreservedly that I > was right and developed his idea by saying that his idea of historicity > [Geschichtlichkeit] was the foundation for his political involvement. In > response to my remark that I could understand many things about his > attitude, with one exception, which was that he would permit himself to be > seated at the same table with a figure such as Julius Streicher (at the > German Academy of Law), he was silent at first. At last he uttered this > well-known rationalisation (which Karl Barth saw so clearly), which amounted > to saying that \\"it all would have been much worse if some men of knowledge > had not been involved.\\" And with a bitter resentment towards people of > culture, he concluded his statement: \\"If these gentlemen had not considered > themselves too refined to become involved, things would have been different, > but I had to stay in there alone.\\" To my reply that one did not have to be > very refined to refuse to work with a Streicher, he answered that it was > useless to discuss Streicher; Der St√ºrmer was nothing more than > \\"pornography.\\" Why didn't Hitler get rid of this sinister individual? He > didn't understand it. For commentators such as Habermas who credit L√∂with's account, there are a number of generally shared implications: one is that Heidegger did not turn away from National Socialism per se but became deeply disaffected with the official philosophy and ideology of the party, as embodied by Alfred B√§umler or Alfred Rosenberg, whose biologistic racist doctrines he never accepted.  Post-war  During the hearings of the Denazification Committee, Hannah Arendt, Heidegger's former student and lover, who was Jewish, spoke on his behalf. (Arendt very cautiously resumed her friendship with Heidegger after the war, despite or even because of the widespread contempt for Heidegger and his political sympathies, and despite his being forbidden to teach for many years.) Heidegger's former friend Karl Jaspers spoke against him, suggesting he would have a detrimental influence on German students because of his powerful teaching presence. In September 1945, the Denazification Committee published its report on Heidegger. He was charged on four counts: his important, official position in the Nazi regime; his introduction of the F√ºhrerprinzip into the University; his engaging in Nazi propaganda and his incitement of students against \\"reactionary\\" professors. He was subsequently dismissed from university the same year. In March 1949, he was declared a \\"follower\\" (Mitl√§ufer) of Nazism by the State Commission for Political Purification. But he was reintegrated in 1951, given emeritus status, and continued teaching until 1976. In 1974, he wrote to his friend Heinrich Petzet: \\"Our Europe is being ruined from below with 'democracy'\\". Thomas Sheehan has noted \\"Heidegger's stunning silence concerning the Holocaust,\\" in contrast to his criticism of the alienation wrought by modern technologies: \\"We have his statements about the six millions unemployed at the beginning of the Nazi regime, but not a word about the six million who were dead at the end of it.\\" Heidegger did not publish anything concerning the Holocaust or the extermination camps, but did indeed mention them. In a 1949 lecture entitled \\"Das Ge-stell\\" (\\"Enframing\\"), he stated: > Agriculture is now a motorized food-industry ‚Äì in essence, the same as the > manufacturing of corpses in gas chambers and extermination camps, the same > as the blockading and starving of nations [the Berlin blockade was then > active], the same as the manufacture of hydrogen bombs. Commentators differ on whether these statements are evidence of a profound disregard for the fate of the Jews or rather, a recontextualization of their suffering in terms of the mechanization of life and death. The French Jewish philosopher Jean-Claude Milner once said: \\"It's a fact, as to gas chambers, the only proper philosophical sentence is by Heidegger [...] It is not satisfactory, but no one else did better.\\" Heidegger's defenders have pointed to the deep ecology dimension of Heidegger's critique of technological \\"enframing\\" ‚Äì i.e., that the way human beings relate to nature has a determining influence on the way we relate to one another.e.g. see Michael Zimmerman, \\"Heidegger, Buddhism, and deep ecology\\" in C. Guignon, ed., The Cambridge Companion to Heidegger (Cambridge University Press, 1993). At least Heidegger does not say that the mechanization of agriculture and the extermination camps are equivalent, \\"the same thing\\" (dasselbe) but \\"the same\\" (das Selbe, a very strange turn of phrase in German), so only \\"in essence\\", but not in the technical or metaphysical meaning of identity. Heidegger explained during his lecture: \\"The same is never the equivalent (das Gleiche). The same is no more only the indistinctive coincidence of the identical. The same is rather the relation of the different.\\"Bremer und Freiburger Vortr√§ge (GA 79), p.52. Moreover, many of those who align themselves with Heidegger philosophically have pointed out that in his work on \\"being-towards-death\\" we can recognize a much more salient criticism of what was wrong with the mass- produced murder of a people. Thinkers as diverse as Giorgio Agamben and Judith Butler have made this point sympathetically. It might be worth pointing out that the SS physician Josef Mengele, the so-called \\"Angel of Death\\", was the son of the founder of a company that produced major farm machinery under the name Karl Mengele & Sons.Josef Mengele This side of Heidegger's thinking can be seen in another controversial lecture from the same period, Die Gefahr (\\"The Danger\\"): > Hundreds of thousands die en masse. Do they die? They succumb. They are done > in. Do they die? They become mere quanta, items in an inventory in the > business of manufacturing corpses. Do they die? They are liquidated > inconspicuously in extermination camps. And even apart from that, right now > millions of impoverished people are perishing from hunger in China. But to > die is to endure death in its essence. To be able to die means to be capable > of this endurance. We are capable of this only if the essence of death makes > our own essence possible. In other words, according to Heidegger, the victims of death camps were deprived not only of their life, but of the dignity of an authentic death, since they were \\"liquidated\\" as if they were inventory or problematic accounting, rather than killed in combat as one would kill an enemy. Another citation levied against Heidegger by his critics, is his answer to a question by his former student Herbert Marcuse, concerning his silence about the Nazi racial policies. In a letter to Marcuse, he wrote: > I can add only that instead of the word \\"Jews\\" [in your letter] there should > be the word \\"East Germans\\", and then exactly the same [terror] holds true of > one of the Allies, with the difference that everything that has happened > since 1945 is public knowledge world-wide, whereas the bloody terror of the > Nazis was in fact kept a secret from the German people. The reference to East Germans concerns the expulsion of Germans after World War II from territories across eastern Europe, which displaced about 15 million and killed another 0.5‚Äì0.6 million,; , p. 278 (a parallel Polish summary translation was also included, this paper was a presentation at an academic conference in Warsaw in 1994), , XXI ‚àí1994 involved gang-rapes and looting throughout East Germany, East Prussia, and Austria, and harshly punitive de-industrialization policies.Alfred de Zayas, A Terrible Revenge: The Ethnic Cleansing of the East European Germans, 1944‚Äì1950, (New York: Palgrave/Macmillan, 1994, 2006). Der Spiegel interview On September 23, 1966, Heidegger was interviewed by Rudolf Augstein and Georg Wolff for Der Spiegel magazine, in which he agreed to discuss his political past provided that the interview be published posthumously (it was published on May 31, 1976). English translation as \\"Only a God Can Save Us\\" by William J. Richardson in For critical readings of the interview, see In particular the contributions by J√ºrgen Habermas (), Blanchot (), Derrida (), and Lacoue-Labarthe (). At his own insistence, Heidegger edited the published version of the interview extensively. In the interview, Heidegger defends his involvement with the Nazi party on two points: first, that he was trying to save the university from being completely taken over by the Nazis, and therefore he tried to work with them. Second, he saw in the historic moment the possibility for an \\"awakening\\" (Aufbruch) which might help to find a \\"new national and social approach\\" to the problem of Germany's future, a kind of middle ground between capitalism and communism. For example, when Heidegger talked about a \\"national and social approach\\" to political problems, he linked this to Friedrich Naumann. According to Thomas Sheehan, Naumann had \\"the vision of a strong nationalism and a militantly anticommunist socialism, combined under a charismatic leader who would fashion a middle-European empire that preserved the spirit and traditions of pre-industrial Germany even as it appropriated, in moderation, the gains of modern technology\\". After 1934, Heidegger claims in the interview, he was more critical of the Nazi government, largely prompted by the violence of the Night of the Long Knives. When the interviewers asked him about the 1935 lecture in which he had referred to the \\"inner truth and greatness of [the National Socialist] movement\\" (i.e. the lecture now incorporated into the book Introduction to Metaphysics; see above), Heidegger said that he used this phrase so that Nazi informants who observed his lectures would understand him to be praising Nazism, but his dedicated students would know this statement was no eulogy for the Nazi party. Rather, he meant it as he expressed it in the parenthetical clarification added in 1953, namely, as \\"the confrontation of planetary technology and modern humanity.\\" However, Karl L√∂with's account of his meeting with Heidegger in 1936 (discussed above) has been cited to refute these contentions. According to Lowith, Heidegger did not make any decisive break with Nazism in 1934, and Heidegger was willing to entertain more profound relations between his philosophy and political involvement than he would subsequently admit. The Der Spiegel interviewers were not in possession of most of the evidence for Heidegger's Nazi sympathies now known, and thus their questions did not press too strongly on those points. In particular, the Der Spiegel interviewers did not bring up Heidegger's 1949 quotation comparing the industrialization of agriculture to the extermination camps. Interestingly, Der Spiegel journalist George Wolff had been an SS-Hauptsturmf√ºhrer with the Sicherheitsdienst, stationed in Oslo during World War II, and had been writing articles with antisemitic and racist overtones in Der Spiegel since war's end. Meeting with Paul Celan In 1967, Heidegger met with the poet Paul Celan, a Jew who had survived concentration camps operated by the Nazis' Romanian allies. On July 24 Celan gave a reading at the University of Freiburg, attended by Heidegger. Heidegger there presented Celan with a copy of What is Called Thinking?, and invited him to visit him at his hut at Todtnauberg, an invitation which Celan accepted. On July 25 Celan visited Heidegger at his retreat, signing the guestbook and spending some time walking and talking with Heidegger. The details of their conversation are not known, but the meeting was the subject of a subsequent poem by Celan, entitled \\"Todtnauberg\\" (dated August 1, 1967). The enigmatic poem and the encounter have been discussed by numerous writers on Heidegger and Celan, notably Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe. A common interpretation of the poem is that it concerns, in part, Celan's wish for Heidegger to apologize for his behavior during the Nazi era.John Felstiner, Paul Celan: Poet, Survivor, Jew, New Haven: Yale University Press, 1995, p. 246. == The Farias and Faye controversies == Although Heidegger's involvement with Nazism was known and had already divided philosophers, the publication, in 1987, of Victor Farias' book Heidegger and Nazism provoked on the topic an open controversy. Farias had access to many documents, including some preserved in the STASI archives. The book, which tries to show that Heidegger supported Hitler and his racial policies and also denounced or demoted colleagues, was highly acclaimed but also starkly criticised. The American philosopher Richard Rorty declared that \\"Farias' book includes more concrete information relevant to Heidegger's relations with the Nazis than anything else available\\",Richard Rorty, Review of Heidegger and Nazism in the New Republic, quoted on the Temple University Press promotional page for Heidegger and Nazism while French philosopher Roger-Pol Droit commented: \\"Mercilessly well-informed, this book is a bomb\\".Le Monde, 14/10/1987 Farias was accused, however, of poor scholarship and sensationalism. In Germany, Hans-Georg Gadamer, a former student of Heidegger, denounced Farias' \\"grotesque superficiality\\"Hans-Georg Gadamer: \\"Zur√ºck von Syrakus?\\" in J√ºrg Altwegg (Hrsg.): Die Heidegger Kontroverse. Frankfurt a. M. 1988, s. Anm. 20, S. 179. and historian Hugo Ott remarked that Farias' methodology was unacceptable in historical research.Paths and wrong Paths, N & K p.138, quoted in Julian Young, Heidegger, Philosophy, Nazism, Cambridge University Press, 1997 p. 39 In France, philosopher Jacques Derrida said Farias's work was \\"sometimes so rough one wonders if the investigator [has read] Heidegger [for] more than an hour\\",Jacques Derrida, http://www.jacquesderrida.com.ar/frances/heidegger.htm#_edn1 \\"Heidegger, l'enfer des philosophes\\", Le Nouvel Observateur, Paris, 6‚Äì12 novembre 1987. while Paul Celan's translator Pierre Joris described it as \\"a savage attempt to demolish Heidegger's thought\\".Pierre Joris defends Heidegger in Heidegger, France, Politics, the University (1989). Fran√ßois F√©dier, one of Heidegger's friends and translators, claimed he could refute all Farias' allegations point by point.Fran√ßois F√©dier, Heidegger. Anatomie d'un scandale, Robert Laffont, Paris, 1988. J√ºrgen Habermas In his 1985 book The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity, J√ºrgen Habermas wrote that Heidegger's lack of explicit criticism against Nazism is due to his unempowering turn (Kehre) towards Being as time and history: \\"he detaches his actions and statements altogether from himself as an empirical person and attributes them to a fate for which one cannot be held responsible.\\" In 2005, the controversy was renewed after Emmanuel Faye published a book with the provocative title Heidegger: The Introduction of Nazism into Philosophy. Faye claims that Heidegger's philosophy was close to Nazism and that fascist and racist ideas are so woven into the fabric of his thought that it does not deserve to be called philosophy. Rather, according to Faye, Heidegger's work should be classified as part of the history of Nazism rather than as philosophy. A debate on the subject that involved Faye and Fran√ßois F√©dier was broadcast on French television in 2007. A group of specialists gathered by F√©dier (Heidegger, all the more reasonFran√ßois F√©dier (ed.), Heidegger, √† plus forte raison, Paris: Fayard, 2007. (Philippe Arjakovsky, Henri Cr√©tella, Pascal David, Fran√ßois F√©dier, Hadrien France- Lanord, Matthieu Gallou, G√©rard Guest, Jean-Pierre Labrousse, Fran√ßois Meyronnis, Jean-Luc Nancy, Fran√ßois Nebout, √âtienne Pinat, Nicolas Plagne, Alexandre Schild, Bernard Sich√®re, √âric Solot, Pierre Teitgen, St√©phane Zagdanski)) heavily criticized Faye for his lack of competence in German and for faking or falsifying quotations. Numerous other Heidegger scholars, themselves critical of Heidegger's relation to Nazism, have taken issue with Faye's claims. For example, Richard Wolin, a close reader of the Heidegger controversy since Farias's book, has said that he is not convinced by Faye's position.\\"An Ethical Question: Does a Nazi Deserve a Place Among Philosophers?\\" by Patricia Cohen. New York Times. Published: November 8, 2009. Peter Gordon, in a long review of Faye's book raises a handful of objections, including the accusation that Faye lets his own philosophical leanings prevent him from treating Heidegger fairly.Peter E. Gordon, Review of Heidegger: The Introduction of Nazism into Philosophy, Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews: An Electronic Journal, 12 March 2010. Recently the thesis of Faye's followers F. Rastier and S. Kellerer, that Heidegger's membership in Hans Frank's committee for philosophy of right (from 1934 until at least 1936) included a participation in the holocaust was rejected by K. Nassirin.; id., Martin Heidegger und die Rechtsphilosophie der NS-Zeit: Detailanalyse eines unbekannten Dokuments (BArch R 61/30, Blatt 171), academia.edu, 2018; Fran√ßois Rastier, Heidegger, th√©oricien et acteur de l‚Äôextermination des juifs?, The Conversation, 1. November 2017  Was Heidegger anti-Semitic?  Emmanuel Faye claims Heidegger criticized the \\"Jewification\\" (\\"Verjudung\\") of German universities in 1916, and favored instead the promotion of the \\"German race\\" (\\"die deutsche Rasse\\").See Nazi Foundations in Heidegger's Work, South Central Review, Volume 23, Number 1, Spring 2006, pp. 55‚Äì66 Faye also claims that Heidegger said of Spinoza that he was \\"ein Fremdk√∂rper in der Philosophie\\", a \\"foreign body in philosophy\\" ‚Äì according to Faye, Fremdk√∂rper was a term that belonged to Nazi vocabulary, and not to classical German. However, this quote is not to be found in Heidegger's writings. Moreover, R√ºdiger Safranski reports that Heidegger in the 1930s defended Spinoza during a lecture, arguing that if Spinoza's philosophy is Jewish, then the whole of philosophy from Leibniz to Hegel is Jewish as well.R.Safranski Ein Meister aus Deutschland, Hanser 1994 p.300 Farias states that the widow of Ernst Cassirer claimed she had heard of Heidegger's \\"inclination to anti-Semitism\\" by 1929. Farias also says that in June 1933, Karl Jaspers criticized The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, a propaganda book supporting anti-Semitic conspiracy theories, and Jaspers recalled much later that Heidegger had responded: \\"But there is a dangerous international alliance of Jews.\\"Thomas Sheehan, \\"Heidegger and the Nazis\\" (), a review of Victor Farias' Heidegger et le nazisme. Original article: On the other hand, Jaspers testified in his report of December 1945: \\"In the twenties, Heidegger was no anti-Semite. With respect to this question he did not always exercise discretion. This doesn't rule out the possibility that, as I must assume, in other cases anti-Semitism went against his conscience and his taste.\\"R.Safranski Martin Heidegger: Between Good and Evil p.256, see also Ulrich Sieg: \\"Die Verjudung des deutschen Geistes\\". Ein unbekannter Brief Heideggers, Die Zeit, 22. Dezember 1989 (Zeit-online) Of course it doesn't rule it in either. There were \\"rumors\\" that Heidegger was anti-Semitic by 1932, and he was aware of them, and vehemently denied them, calling them \\"slander\\" in a letter to Hannah Arendt. In response to her concern about these rumors that he was becoming anti-Semitic, Heidegger wrote ironically: > This man who comes anyway and urgently wants to write a dissertation is a > Jew. The man who comes to see me every month to report on a large work in > progress is also a Jew. The man who sent me a substantial text for an urgent > reading a few weeks ago is a Jew. The two fellows whom I helped get accepted > in the last three semesters are Jews. The man who, with my help, got a > stipend to go to Rome is a Jew. Whoever wants to call this 'raging anti- > Semitism' is welcome to do so. Beyond that, I am now just as much an anti- > Semite in University issues as I was ten years ago in Marburg. To say > absolutely nothing about my personal relationships with Jews [e.g. Husserl, > Misch, Cassirer, and others]. And above all it cannot touch my relationship > to you.Hannah Arendt and Martin Heidegger, Letters, 1925 ‚Äì 1975 (Harcourt, > 2004), letter no. 45. According to Karl L√∂with, several Nazis themselves seemed not to believe in Heidegger's anti-Semitism: > The petty-bourgeois orthodoxy of the party was suspicious of Heidegger‚Äôs > National Socialism insofar as Jewish and racial considerations played no > role. [His book] Sein und Zeit [Being and Time] was dedicated to the Jew > Husserl, his Kant-book to the half-Jew Scheler, and in his courses at > Freiburg, Bergson and Simmel were taught. His spiritual concerns did not > seem to conform to those of the ‚ÄúNordic race‚Äù, which cared little about > Angst in the face of nothingness. Conversely, Professor H. Naumann did not > hesitate to explain German mythology with the help of concepts from Sein und > Zeit, discovering ‚Äúcare‚Äù in Odin and the ‚Äúthey‚Äù in Baldur. Yet neither the > aforementioned disdain nor approval of his National Socialist credentials > counts for much in itself. Heidegger‚Äôs decision for Hitler went far beyond > simple agreement with the ideology and program of the Party. He was and > remained a National Socialist, as did Ernst J√ºnger, who was certainly on the > margins and isolated, but nevertheless far from being without influence. > Heidegger‚Äôs influence came through the radicalism with which he based the > freedom of one‚Äôs ownmost individual as well as German dasein [being-there] > on the manifestness of the naught (des Nichts).Karl L√∂with, Mein Leben in > Deutschland vor und nach 1933 (Stuttgart: Metzler Verlag, 1986), translated > by Richard Wolin. pp. 56‚Äì58. Heidegger commented on the Nazi identification of Judaism and Communism in 1936, writing that: > The final form of Marxism [...] has essentially nothing to do with either > Judaism or even with Russia; if somewhere a non-developed spiritualism is > still slumbering, it is in the Russian people; Bolshevism is originally > Western; it is a European possibility: the emergence of the masses, > industry, technology, the extinction of Christianity; but inasmuch as the > dominance of reason as an equalizing of everyone is but the consequence of > Christianity and as the latter is fundamentally of Jewish origin (cf. > Nietzsche's thought on the slave revolt with respect to morality), > Bolshevism is in fact Jewish; but then Christianity is also fundamentally > Bolshevist!Beitr√§ge zur Philosophie (vom Ereignis) (1936‚Äì1938), GA 65 S. 54. First published in 2014, Heidegger's Black Notebooks, written between 1931 and 1941, contain several anti-semitic statements, have led to more re-evaluation of the issue. Heidegger rejected the \\"biologically grounded racism\\" of the Nazis, replacing it with linguistic-historical heritage. Defenders of Heidegger In his preface to Heidegger's Zollikon Seminars, Medard Boss writes: \\"I made inquiries and Heidegger very clearly seemed to be the most slandered man I had ever encountered. He had become entangled in a network of lies by his colleagues. Most of the people, who were unable to do serious harm to the substance of Heidegger's thinking, tried to get at Heidegger the man with personal attacks. The only remaining puzzle was why Heidegger did not defend himself against these slanders publicly.\\"Martin Heidegger, Zollikon Seminars: Protocols, Conversations, Letters, Northwestern University Press, 2001 p. ix F√©dier comments on this point with Nietzsche's remark that \\"the philosopher has to be the bad conscience of his age.\\" In 2015 Nils Gilje, professor of Philosophy at University of Bergen, said to media that \\"There is little that indicates that Heidegger defended the more or less official German racial politics\\".Nils Gilje (2 December 2015). ¬´Hatets filosofi¬ª.

The orchestration has subsequently been rewritten by composers such as Reinhold Gli√®re and Heorhiy Maiboroda. This is one of the best-known Ukrainian comic operas depicting national themes. It was premiered with a Russian libretto on , in St Petersburg (at the time the capital of the Russian Empire). However, it is now normally performed in a Ukrainian translation. ==Composition history== According to contemporary accounts, Hulak-Artemovsky based the libretto on a story by the historian Mykola Kostomarov. The composer wrote nearly all of libretto, although some poetic phrasings are attributed to his good friend, the journalist V. Sykevych. The story depicts the events following the destruction of the island fortress of Zaporizhian Sich, the historic stronghold of the Ukrainian Cossacks on the Dnieper River. Although historically this destruction was ordered by the Russian Empress Catherine II in 1775, for unknown reasons the composer chose to set the action in 1772. To tell the story of the freedom-loving Zaporozhian Cossacks of Ukraine, who had fought against the Russian Empire, Hulak-Artemovsky deliberately set the story in Turkish lands with the Cossacks fighting for the Sultan. This change of locale helped the work get past the Tsar's censors, who normally banned stories about Ukrainian Cossacks. The orchestral score was completed in the autumn of 1862 by Konstantin Lyadov, (father of Anatoly Lyadov), who developed it under the guidance of Hulak-Artemovsky. Hulak-Artemovsky had composed the original piano score and written the libretto (in Russian), no later than 12 July of that year (as the earliest known manuscript bears that date). The libretto and score were first published in 1866 in St Petersburg, by the firm of F. Stelovsky. In 1902, the Ukrainian composer Oleksandr Horily wrote the aria Prylyn', prylyn ( ‚Äì \\"Come, come\\"), when arranging the comic opera for Mykola Sadovsky's theatrical troupe. The aria essentially extended the vocal range of the character Oksana, who had previously been played by mezzo- sopranos; this aria is intended for a soprano. After 1898, the original role of Prokop Teren (), a rival of Andriy for the affections of Oksana, was eliminated (although in Moscow, the role was performed up until 1915). ==Roles== {  border=\\"1\\" !Role !Voice type !Premiere cast 26 April 1863 - Ivan Karas, a Zaporozhian Cossack, aged 45‚Äì50 bass Semen Hulak-Artemovsky - Odarka, aged 35, wife of Karas soprano  - Andriy, a young Zaporozhian Cossack tenor - Oksana, an orphan maiden, raised by Karas and Odarka soprano (originally mezzo-soprano) Darya Leonova - The Sultan, aged 30 baritone  - Selikh-Aha, a Turkish lord tenor  - Ibrahim-Ali, an Imam bass  - Hasan, a servant   - } ==Synopsis== The story is based on a historical event: when the Zaporizhian Sich was overwhelmed by the Russian army, the Zaporizhian Cossacks and their families headed across the Danube River to the apparently safe haven of the Ottoman Empire (this area is now part of Romania) and established the Danube Sich (see Zaporozhian Host: Russian rule). The comedy arises from the efforts made by a Cossack clan to adjust to their new home, and from the eccentric behaviour of an amorous Turkish Sultan. The plot revolves around a chance encounter between Ivan Karas, an old Dnieper Cossack and the Turkish Sultan travelling incognito, resulting in permission for all the \\"Cossacks beyond the Danube\\" to resettle on Imperial Russian land, back in Ukraine. ==Noted arias== *Transliterated title: Prylyn', prylyn, ‚Äì \\"Come, come\\" ‚Äì Act 1 (Oksana) *Transliterated title: Vidkilya tse ty usiavsa, ‚Äì \\"Where did you come from?\\" ‚Äì Act 1 (Odarka and Karas'). *Transliterated title: Chorna khmara za dibrovy, --\\"Black Clouds Behind the Grove\\" ‚Äì Act 2 (Oksana and Andriy) * ‚Äì \\"O Lord of Heaven and Earth\\" ‚Äì (Chorus) ==Recordings== Zaporozhets za Dunayem (A Cossack Beyond the Danube) *Ivan Karas: Sergei Yaroshenko, bass; Odarka: Natalia Moiseyeva; Andrei: Stepan Fitysch; Oksana: Lidiya Zabiliasta; The Sultan: Mykola Koval; Imam: Ivan Tcherney; Selih-Aga: Yuri Khomych *Chorus and Orch of the National Opera of Ukraine/Ivan Hamkalo. *Recorded in May 2009 at the National Opera and Ballet Theatre of Ukraine, Kiev. 1hr 48' ==Film== Zaporozhets Za Dunayem also known as Cossacks Beyond the Danube 1938-Ukraine/USSR-Costume Adventure/Film- Opera Produced in Ukraine by a home-grown production staff, this comic opera was released in English-speaking countries as Cossacks Beyond the Danube.

The MSA encompasses Broome and Tioga counties,METROPOLITAN STATISTICAL AREAS AND COMPONENTS , Office of Management and Budget, 2007-05-11. Accessed 2008-07-27. which together had a population of 251,725 as of the 2010 census. From 1963 to 1983, the MSA also included neighboring Susquehanna County in Pennsylvania, part of which still falls in the Binghamton, NY‚ÄìPA Urban Area. In addition to these three counties, the greater region includes parts of Delaware and Chenango counties in New York; portions of Cortland and Otsego counties in New York and Wayne County, Pennsylvania are sometimes considered part of the region as well. Using the definition of a 30-mile radius from Binghamton, the population as of the 2010 census is 317,331. The Greater Binghamton name was adopted in the early 21st century to better identify the region with its most well-known city in efforts of marketing and external promotion. The metropolitan area is located in the Southern Tier of New York State and lies on Pennsylvania's northern border, approximately 66 miles (110 km) south of Syracuse, New York. ==Triple Cities== Historically, the region has been known as the Triple Cities and is made up of Binghamton, Johnson City, and Endicott, New York, the latter two of which are technically villages. The area is also sometimes called the \\"Greater Binghamton Area\\" as the city of Binghamton is the largest and most prominent of the three, with a population greater than the other two combined, and a much larger geographical area. The three incorporated areas are tightly squeezed together and can seem like a single large, albeit spread out, city. They are economically integrated, though they retain their political identities. For example, many people living in Binghamton go shopping at the Oakdale Mall in Johnson City on a regular basis, and it's very common for someone living in one city to work or go to school in one of the other two. Some have put forward the idea of merging the three into a single city, but it seems politically unlikely. While \\"triple cities\\" strictly covers only the three main municipalities mentioned, the term is also used by some to refer broadly to the surrounding area of conurbation, including Endwell, West Corners, the Upper Front Street area (technically in the town of Dickinson), and the town of Vestal. Vestal is home to the Vestal Parkway, a major commercial strip for the entire area, housing one of the two major multiplex theaters in the area, and a number of shopping plazas, major chain stores, and eateries. Binghamton University is also physically located in Vestal, though its mailing address is in Binghamton. ==Transportation== The Municipalities all sit together, parallel to the Southern Tier Expressway (NY 17, the main part of future Interstate 86). This along with a junction to Interstate 81, Interstate 88, and U.S. Route 11 along with New York State Route 12, form the main transportation routes for the area. NY 17, and I-81 are the high-speed roadways providing quick expressway access between the cities, while the other two serve as secondary gateways to the area. Interstate 88 starts between exits 5 and 6 on I-81 and terminates in Albany. Main Street (NY 17C) is connected as a single road through much of the urban core, beginning in downtown Binghamton and running through Johnson City, Endwell, and Endicott. Broome County Transit operates 14 fixed route bus lines in and around Binghamton and its metropolitan area. Greyhound Bus Lines and New York Trailways operate intercity coach bus service through Binghamton with direct connection to major cities in the region such as Ithaca, Syracuse, Rochester, Albany, and New York City. In addition, Greater Binghamton Airport is located in Maine, New York. As of 2018, Delta is the only commercial carrier, with scheduled service to Detroit. ==Communities== Cities *Binghamton (Principal city) Towns { - valign=top  *Barker *Barton *Berkshire *Binghamton *Dickinson *Candor *Chenango *Colesville *Conklin *Fenton *Kirkwood *Lisle *Maine  *Nanticoke *Newark Valley *Nichols *Owego *Richford *Sanford *Spencer *Tioga *Triangle *Union *Vestal *Windsor } Villages *Candor *Deposit (partial) *Endicott *Johnson City *Lisle *Newark Valley *Nichols *Owego *Port Dickinson *Spencer *Waverly *Whitney Point *Windsor Census-designated places *Apalachin *Endwell Hamlets *Campville *Chenango Forks *Killawog *Hillcrest *Nineveh ==Demographics== As of the census of 2010, there were 251,725 people, 102,517 households, and 62,796 families residing within the MSA.

It is a procreation sonnet within the Fair Youth sequence. In the sonnet, the speaker declares his admiration and love for the beauty of youth, but warns this figure of youth that he will lose it if he doesn't revitalize himself through offspring. The primary arguments made in this procreation sonnet are the maintenance of self-identity and duty to one's own heritage. His tone throughout the sonnet is intimate, highlighting the theme of affection for youth that is prevalent in the first seventeen sonnets. ==Paraphrase== The sonnet begins with the speaker expressing lament to youth with \\"O that you were yourself!\\" More simply, the speaker deplores that youth isn't absolute and permanent, and with \\"yourself\\", the speaker is referring to the figure of youth's soul. Following this, the speaker address the youth as \\"love\\", further developing the speaker's theme of adoration and personal affection for youth. From there, the speaker tells this youth that \\"you are / No longer yours, than you yourself here live\\", saying that the youth's identity is constantly fading away from him as he ages, as if he is unbecoming himself. With the lines \\"Against this coming end you should prepare / And your sweet semblance to some other give\\", the speaker is simply saying that the youth's life is slipping away day after day, and if he doesn't get married and have children, he will lose his identity to his death. Continuing from this idea, the speaker says \\"So should that beauty which you hold in lease / Find no determination; then you were / Yourself again after yourself's decease, / When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear\\", all meaning that whatever beauty the youth still has is only temporary (leased to him) and will be lost, unless he has children who continue the legacy and identity of his youthful beauty even after death. Continuing with \\"Who lets so fair a house fall to decay,\\" the speaker refers to the youth as this \\"house\\" in reference to his fair body and his fair lineage. Adding to this, the speaker continues on with \\"Which husbandry in honour might uphold, / Against the stormy gusts of winter's day / And barren rage of death's eternal cold?\\". These lines suggest that by taking up marriage and becoming a husband and a father, the youth might be able to maintain his essence of youth against the devastations of time and age. This, the speaker compares to storms and winter, ending with the threat of the eternal nature of death, at which point the youth would be too late in renewing himself. In the ending couplet, the speaker mirrors his starting wail of lament in line 1 with \\"O! none but unthrifts. Dear my love, you know, / You had a father: let your son say so.\\" Here, the speaker is separating the youth figure he adores from those he considers foolish, or \\"unthrifts\\", and connects that to the youth's inheritance, suggesting that only \\"unthrifts\\" would ignore their inheritance of life and youth and deny their own fathers' wish for continued lineage and legacy. ==Context== Sonnet 13 is included as one of Shakespeare's Procreation sonnets. Sonnets 1-17 are an introduction to the plot of the complete sonnets. Each of these 17 sonnets is a different argument to convince the young man to marry a woman and have children to continue his legacy and to have his beauty live on.Shakespeare, William, and David Alexander West. Shakespeare's Sonnets: With a New Commentary. London: Gerald Duckworth & Co, 2007. 6-7. Print. In Sonnet 13, the poet uses his undying love for the young man as a motivator and as an encourager for the youth to marry a woman and eternalize his beauty by having children.Duncan Jones, Katherine. Shakespeare's Sonnets. New York: AS, 2010. 100. Print The Sonnets collection is suspected to have been written during an unknown timeline of years beginning prior to 1598 and then more periodically from 1599‚Äì1609. 1609 is the year that the collection was finally published for the first time.Duncan Jones, Katherine. Shakespeare's Sonnets. New York: AS, 2010. 12. Print. Shakespeare's book of sonnets is dedicated to \\"Mr. W.H.\\". There has been much academic speculation and conversation over who W.H. could be. One argument is that Anne Hathaway, the bride of Shakespeare, is the mysterious W.H. because of her masculine features. Another possibility is that W.H. could refer to Anne's brother, William Hathaway. The initials are appropriate for the dedication. As expressed in Sonnet 104, the figure of youth to whom the sonnets are directed towards is hinted to be someone who has had of at least three years. In attempts to match Shakespeare's references of time and known relationships, of who this figure of youth (and also W.H) may be is William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke, who Shakespeare may have dedicated his First Folio. While the connection seems strong, it is only speculation. Sonnet 13 shows the increasing amount of love that the speaker holds for the man and is more intimate than the previous sonnets.Duncan-Jones, Katherine (2010). Shakespeare's Sonnets. Bloomsbury, New York. 136. Print. It is also the first of Shakespeare's sonnets where he refers to the young man as \\"Love\\" and \\"My dear love.\\" ==Structure== Sonnet 13 follows the same format as the other Shakespearean Sonnets. There are fourteen iambic pentameter lines and the rhyme scheme is ABAB CDCD EFEF GG. The rhyme scheme follows that of the 'English', or 'Surreyan', form of sonnet. After line 8 (the octave), there is a change of tone and fresh imagery.Duncan-Jones, Katherine (2010). Shakespeare's Sonnets. Bloomsbury, New York. 96-97. Print. This is shown when the speaker moves from speaking about the young man's loss of identity to age with words like \\"hold in lease\\" and \\"yourself's decease\\" before the end of the octave to speaking about the regenerative nature of husbandry and the duty to one's parents to continue the line with words such as \\"Who lets so fair a house fall to decay\\" and \\"dear my love you know: / You had a father; let your son say so.\\" Line eleven may be taken as an example of regular iambic pentameter: √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / Against the stormy gusts of winter's day (13.11) :/ = ictus, a metrically strong syllabic position. √ó = nonictus. The rhetorical volta or turn between line eight and nine is supported by the distinct rhythms of the two lines, which may be scanned: √ó √ó / / √ó √ó / / √ó / When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear. / √ó √ó / √ó / / √ó √ó / Who lets so fair a house fall to decay, (13.8-9) Here, the two instances of ictuses moved to the right tend to set a deliberate pace, whereas the following two instances of ictuses moved to the left suggest an abrupt rhythm. ==Analysis== In Sonnet 13, for the first time, Shakespeare refers to the young man as \\"you\\" instead of his usual address of \\"thou\\", which he used in sonnets 1-12. This is more formal as thou, like the French \\"tu\\" is used for intimates and the use of \\"you\\" here is therefore at odds with the personal intensity toward this figure of youth . Its use could signify potential loss.Busse, Ulrich. Linguistic Variation in the Shakespeare Corpus: Morpho-syntactic Variability of Second Person Pronouns. Amsterdam: J. Benjamins Pub., 2002. 91. Print. Shakespeare, William, and David Alexander West. Shakespeare's Sonnets: With a New Commentary. London: Gerald Duckworth & Co, 2007. 50. Print. The love that Shakespeare has for the young man has contradicting views in Sonnet 13. One aspect of love includes Shakespeare viewing the young man as a lover, or perhaps, as a personification of love itself.Mirsky, Mark J. The Drama in Shakespeare's Sonnets: \\"A Satire to Decay\\". Madison: Fairleigh Dickinson UP, 2011. 45. Print. In Line 1, the young man is referred to as \\"Love\\" and in Line 13 as \\"My Love\\", the first time these terms of endearment are used in the sonnet sequence.Vendler, Helen. The Art of Shakespeare's Sonnets. Cambridge, MA: Belknap of Harvard UP, 1997. 102. Print. These lines suggest an intimate, and possibly romantic relationship between the two men, though this piece focuses on the young man having children. A contradicting view of love occurs in Line 14, when Shakespeare states \\"You had a father; let your son say so\\". This final line from Sonnet 13 suggests that the love that Shakespeare had for the young man was a parental love, similar to one a father would have towards his son.Vendler, Helen. The Art of Shakespeare's Sonnets. Cambridge, MA: Belknap of Harvard UP, 1997. 102. Print. The repetition of terms relating to death, like end, decease, decay, and barren in contrast to the speaker's pleas to the figure of youth with terms like sweet, beauty, and husbandry highlight the poem's theme of having children in marriage to combat mortality's damages.McGarrity, Maria. \\"The \\"Houses of Decay\\" and Shakespeare's \\"Sonnet 13\\": Another Nexus in \\"Proteus\\"\\" James Joyce Quarterly Fall 35.1 (1997): 153-55. JSTOR. Web. 17 Sept. 2014. In 16th century conveyancing 'the determination of a tenancy' or 'the determination of a lease', its ceasing, occurred when the husbandman or leasee died without heirs and the use of the lands or estate fell again to the leasor. The poet here argues that, if the youth were to have sired children, then the beauty, at present leased to him, should on his death not find a \\"determination\\" or cessation, because heirs would exist to whom the lease of beauty could be bequeathed. ==ReferencesFurther reading== *Ingram, W.G., and Theodore Redpath, eds.

The outlaws have a good hunt. Robin Hood says there is no match for Little John within a hundred miles; Will Scadlock tells him that a friar at Fountains Abbey can. Robin sets out to see this monk. He finds him by a riverside and forces the monk to carry him over, except that the friar throws him in halfway across. They battle until Robin asks a favor: to let him blow on his horn. When the friar agrees, Robin's men appear, with bows in hand. The friar asks a favor: to let him whistle. When Robin agrees, many fierce dogs appear. In the later version, Little John shoots twenty of them, and the Friar agrees to make peace with Robin. In the earlier version, Robin Hood good-humoredly refuses further combat; in both earlier and later versions Robin invites him to join the band. ==Adaptions== Howard Pyle used this tale in his The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood as part of the tale of Alan-a-Dale: Robin needed a priest who would perform the wedding ceremony in defiance of authority, and Will Scarlet proposed Friar Tuck.Michael Patrick Hearn, \\"Afterword\\", Howard Pyle The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood, p. 384 ==Thirteen months== The Percy Folio version of the ballad begins with the stanza: :But how many merry monthes be in the yeere? :There are thirteen, I say; :The midsummer moone is the merryest of all, :Next to the merry month of May. Robert Graves in his English and Scottish Ballads used this stanza to support his argument for pagan survivals in the Robin Hood legend, and for the popular survival of a supposedly pagan thirteen-month calendar. ==ReferencesExternal links== *INTRODUCTION TO ROBIN HOOD AND THE CURTAL FRIAR *Robin Hood and the Curtal Friar Category:Child Ballads Category:Robin Hood ballads ","title":"Robin Hood and the Curtal Friar"},{"id":"5601413","text":"Qart Hadasht or Qart-·∏•ada≈°t means \\"New City\\" in Phoenician and is * the original name given to the ancient city of Carthage (located in today's Tunisia) by the Phoenicians * the name given to Cartagena (located in today's Spain) by the Phoenicians ","title":"Qart Hadasht"},{"id":"5601415","text":"The Unionidae are a family of freshwater mussels, the largest in the order Unionida, the bivalve molluscs sometimes known as river mussels, or simply as unionids.

In addition, gill morphology can determine particle size filtered, as well as the rate. ==Reproduction== Unionidae are distinguished by a unique and complex lifecycle. Most unionids are of separate sex, although some species, such as Elliptio complanata, are known to be hermaphroditic.Downing, J. A., Amyot, J.P., P√©russe, M., Rochon, Y. (1989). \\"Visceral sex, hermaphroditism, and protandry in a population of the freshwater bivalve Elliptio complanata.\\" Journal of the North American Benthological Society 8(1): 92-99. The sperm is ejected from the mantle cavity through the male‚Äôs excurrent aperture and taken into the female's mantle cavity through the incurrent aperture. Fertilised eggs move from the gonads to the gills (marsupia) where they further ripen and metamorph into glochidia, the first larval stage. Mature glochidia are released by the female and then attach to the gills, fins, or skin of a host fish. A cyst is quickly formed around the glochidia, and they stay on the fish for several weeks or months before they fall off as juvenile mussels, which then bury themselves in the sediment. Some of the species in the Unionidae, commonly known as pocketbook mussels, have evolved a remarkable reproductive strategy. The edge of the female's body that protrudes from the valves of the shell develops into an imitation of a small fish complete with markings and false eyes. This decoy moves in the current and attracts the attention of real fish. Some fish see the decoy as prey, while others see a conspecific, i.e. a member of their own species. Whatever they see, they approach for a closer look and the mussel releases huge numbers of larvae from her gills, dousing the inquisitive fish with her tiny, parasitic young. These glochidial larvae are drawn into the fish's gills, where they attach and trigger a tissue response that forms a small cyst in which the young mussel resides. It feeds by breaking down and digesting the tissue of the fish within the cyst.Piper, Ross (2007), Extraordinary Animals: An Encyclopedia of Curious and Unusual Animals, Greenwood Press. Sex is determined by a region located on the mitochondrial DNA, the male open-reading frame (M-ORF) and female open-reading frame (F-ORF). Hermaphroditic mussels lack these regions and contain a female-like open-reading frame dubbed hermaphroditic open-reading frame (H-ORF). In many mussels, the hermaphroditic state is ancestral and the male sex evolved later. This region of the mitochondria also may be responsible for the evolution of doubly uniparental inheritance seen in freshwater mussels.Breton, S., Stewart, Donald T., Shepardson, Sally, Trdan, Richard J., Bogan, Arthur E., Chapman, Eric G., Ruminas, Adrew J., Piontkivska, Helen, Hoeh, Walter R.

For example, in the Dinosaur Park Formation, fossil hadrosaur eggshell is rare because the breakdown of tannins from local coniferous vegetation would have caused the ancient waters to become acidic. Eggshell fragments are present in only two microfossil sites, both of which are dominated by the preserved shells of invertebrate life, including unionids. The slow dissolution of these shells releasing calcium carbonate into the water raised the water's pH high enough to prevent the eggshell fragments from dissolving before they could be fossilized.Tanke, D.H. and Brett-Surman, M.K. 2001.

He has been residing in London with his family since he left Bangladesh in September 2008. ==Background and education== Rahman was born on 20 November 1967 to Ziaur Rahman, the 7th President of Bangladesh, and Begum Khaleda Zia, the 10th Prime Minister of Bangladesh. He studied at *Bangladesh Air Force Shaheen College, Dhaka and completed his SSC from Dhaka Residential Model College. He then earned his HSC from Adamjee Cantonment College. He graduated in international relations from the University of Dhaka. ==Career== Rahman started his political career as a primary member of the BNP Gabtali Upazila, Bogra District in 1988. Rahman actively assembled support for the party during the national elections of 1991, when the transition was taking place from the autocratic ruling to the democratic government. He was a member of the BNP's National Campaign Strategy Committee, and was also responsible for coordinating the election campaigns in five constituencies from which his mother Khaleda Zia was contesting.\\"The Political Thought of Tarique Rahman\\" During that period, he proactively organized the BNP units of Bogra and changed the inherent cultures to make politics more production and development oriented. After the BNP's success in the national elections of 1991 and the formation of the new government, Rahman was offered a senior role in the party as recognition of his contributions. However, he was reluctant to take up a higher position in order to have enough time to strengthen the party at the grassroots level. For many years, he remained active in developing the Bogra units of the BNP. During the national elections of 1996, the party grassroots and the senior leadership requested Rahman to contest a constituency from Bogra. But he declined the offer with a view to furthering his work at the grassroots levels and coordinating the election campaigns for his mother. During the ruling of the Awami League government in 1996‚Äì2001, Rahman mobilized movements against the actions of the government. He actively campaigned to address issues of economic deprivation and started championing a countrywide consultation program aimed at publicizing the plight of the people living in rural areas. This large-scale program, the first in the history of Bangladesh of this nature, drove mass mobilization against the government, which in turn, played an instrumental role in fostering the return of the BNP to power. He established the secret ballot system in Bogra to elect leaders through open council. In the national elections held in 2001, the party won a landslide victory with a two-thirds majority. ==Personal life== Rahman currently lives in suburban London. He is married to Zubaida Rahman, a physician and the youngest daughter of Rear Admiral Mahbub Ali Khan, former Chief of Naval Staff of Bangladesh Navy. She is the first cousin of Irene Khan, a former Secretary General of Amnesty International. Their only daughter Zaima Rahman is a barrister. ==References== Category:1965 births Category:Living people Category:Dhaka Residential Model College alumni Category:Bangladesh Nationalist Party politicians Category:Children of national leaders Category:Ziaur Rahman ","title":"Tarique Rahman"},{"id":"5601427","text":"John Butler, 17th Earl of Ormonde, 10th Earl of Ossory (1740‚Äì1795) was an Irish peer and Member of Parliament (MP).

Alan understood the potential of Anarchic and was instrumental in bringing Anarchic from an idea consisting of three T-shirt designs to an internationally known fashion company. Charles Uzzell Edwards joined Alan and Nick and together developed the \\"Anarchic\\" line which was noted for its beautifully bizarre graphics, textures, and outrageously profound designs. Anarchic Adjustment opened two fashion shops in Japan, one opened in Tokyo in 1994, west of Ebisu station and a second store in the American Village in Osaka inside the American Village Parco Store.

Abbye Eville was born on August 11, 1917, and moved to Santa Monica, California, in 1924. She acquired the nickname \\"Pudgy\\" as a child, and the name stuck, even though she weighed approximately 115 pounds at a height of 5'2\\". She began dating UCLA student Les Stockton during her senior year of high school; they were married in 1941. ==Career== Stockton and her husband were frequent visitors to Muscle Beach, where they primarily worked on acrobatics and gymnastics. One of their most famous feats involved Pudgy serving as the \\"understander\\", supporting Les (180 pounds) over her head in a hand to hand stand. Pudgy quickly became a media favorite, and was included in pictorials in Life, Pic, and Laff. She was also featured in the newsreels Whatta Build and Muscle Town USA, as well as ads for Ritamine Vitamin Company and the Universal Camera Company. She estimated that she was featured on the cover of forty-two magazines by the end of the 1940s (Todd, 1999). She posed with many of the top male bodybuilders of the time, including John Grimek and Steve Reeves (Black, 2004). In 1944, Stockton began writing a regular column on women's training, \\"Barbelles\\", in Strength & Health magazine, then the most influential fitness magazine in the world. She also helped organize the first sanctioned weightlifting contests for women. The first of these contests with a sanction from the Amateur Athletic Union was held on February 28, 1947, at the Southwest Arena in Los Angeles. In that contest, Stockton pressed 100 pounds, snatched 105 pounds, and clean and jerked 135 pounds.

Bergendahl's Holmenkollen 50 km cross country skiing victories have only been exceeded by one skier (Thorleif Haug) while his Holmenkollen Nordic combined victories have been matched by three others (Johan Gr√∏ttumsbr√•ten, Rauno Miettinen, and Bjarte Engen Vik). Bergendahl earned the Holmenkollen medal in 1910 while his nephew Lars earned the honor in 1939. Lauritz Bergendahl was the first skiing star, Nordic or Alpine, anywhere. He was called simply the \\"ski king\\". Between 1910 and 1915, he won the 50 km race at Holmenkollen five times. Born in 1888, he was nearly lost to skiing through religious revivalistm, but his other vocation was too strong. His stardom arose from the lack of national heroes in the aftermath of independence and the poor calibre of politicians. Bergendahl was probably the first sporting figure, anywhere, faut de mieux, to do duty as national icon. He was the first skier to train methodically. He systematically developed both speed and stamina. He was a pioneer of tempo training. In particular, he was interested in coordination of sticks and skis. He was a pioneer in adapting the Finnish double heave on the sticks as part of an innovative tactical adjustment of technique to terrain. He was the founder of modern Nordic skiing, and the analytical system of coaching. By trade he was a forester, like most of the early Nordic skiers, mainly because of the strength and suppleness developed in wielding axe and saw. The first free heel toe binding to go into production was the Selmer's \\"Bergendahl\\" binding.

The library, situated in Morrab House within Morrab Gardens, was founded in 1818 and is financed through membership subscriptions, legacies, grants, and a regular contribution from the Dennis G C Myner Charitable Trust. ==Collections== The Morrab Library holds over 60,000 books, and extensive archive collections. Notable collections include the Dawson Napoleonic Collection comprising over 3,000 engravings and prints, photographic collections of over 15,000 prints and negatives, extensive runs of 18th and 19th century journals, the Jenner Collection of Cornish and Celtic books, and over 2,000 books printed from the 16th to 18th centuries. ==History== The Morrab Library was originally known as the Penzance Library, and was officially formed at the beginning of 1818. It emerged out of the activities of two Penzance book clubs, one each for ladies and gentlemen. The Ladies Book Club was the earliest, created in 1770, and lending books to its members for four days at a time. The first president was Sir Rose Price Bart of Trengwainton and by 1820 the library had over one hundred members. The Library was first located in an apartment at Cummins's Hotel in Penzance's Market Place, before moving, in 1818, to Geological House at 10 North Parade where it shared premises with the Royal Geological Society of Cornwall and the Agricultural Society. During 1867 the Library moved to the new Public Buildings (now known as St John's Hall) in Alverton Street. The Morrab Library is housed within Morrab House in the Morrab Gardens, which was built in 1841 for the brewer Samuel Pidwell. The house is described as \\"...a large stucco villa in the Georgian manner with columned porch\\" and is a grade II listed building. Shortly after the Pidwell family moved to Portugal, it became the home of Charles Campbell Ross, Member of Parliament for the St Ives constituency from 1881‚Äì1885. On 16 July 1888 the house and walled gardens were bought by the Corporation of Penzance for ¬£3,120 for use as a municipal park. The gardens opened on 27 September 1889 with a half day holiday and a procession through the streets. The library moved into Morrab House in the same year. The Morrab Library is a member of the Independent Libraries Association, which was founded in 1989. ==Past presidents== * Sir Rose Price, Bart., 13 May 1818‚Äì1824 * Lt-gen Watkins Tench, 6 September 1824‚Äì1828 (may have been nominal president until his death at Devonport, 7 May 1833) * Joseph Carne, 13 January, 1834‚Äì12 October 1858 * J J A Boase, 10 January 1859‚Äìend of 1873 * William Bolitho , junior, January 1874‚Äì ==Past librarians== * Dr John Forbes, 1818‚Äì1822 * Rev John Foxell, 1822‚Äì1852 * James Flamank, 1852‚Äì1862 * Leonard Richard Willan, MD, 14 May 1862‚Äì22 May 1882 * Rev Prebendary Hedgeland 13 June 1882‚Äì ==ReferencesFurther reading== * A Perambulating Contributor (1883) Roundabout Papers No II.

Gelotte switched to his current position on lead guitar after Glenn Ljungstr√∂m left the band, sharing lead/rhythm guitar work with former In Flames guitarist Jesper Str√∂mblad. In March 2004, Bj√∂rn (along with Jesper Str√∂mblad) were both ranked #70 out of 100 Greatest Heavy Metal Guitarists of all time by Guitar World. ==Other projects== Before joining In Flames, Bj√∂rn Gelotte was a member of Flesh of Sights. He is currently involved in a side project called All Ends, which he and his former In Flames bandmate Jesper Str√∂mblad write the songs for. Bj√∂rn's sister is one of the singers for All Ends. Neither of them plan to play in the side project live due to In Flames' demanding schedule. He also played guitar on the track \\"Self Versus Self\\" by UK/Australian drum and bass act Pendulum, along with his bandmates Anders Frid√©n and Peter Iwers. Gelotte did several guest appearances, contributing a guitar solo on the track \\"Letters From Neverend\\", from the album Schlacht by the band Avatar, and performing lead guitar for the song \\"Force of Hand\\", from the album Atoma by the band Dark Tranquillity. ==Equipment== Bj√∂rn Gelotte uses a Gibson Les Paul Custom and a custom shop Les Paul, both with EMG 81 (bridge) and EMG 85 (neck) active pickups. The custom shop Les Paul has a few changes to the stock model, such as inlay blocks similar to the Les Paul Supreme. He uses a POD XT and other Line 6 equipment, Dunlop custom strings, and Dunlop .88 MM Tortex picks. On In Flames' albums up to Whoracle, both Bj√∂rn and co-guitarist Jesper Str√∂mblad exclusively tuned their guitars to C standard. From Colony to Reroute to Remain, In Flames started using Drop A# tuning, on some of the tracks, and on all albums since Soundtrack to Your Escape, In Flames have been using drop A# tuning exclusively.

It reflects on the human cost of rebellion rather than the glorification of the conflict and the martyrdom of its leaders. It has been performed and recorded by many Irish artists.

She was probably baptized along with most other Ndongo-Matamba nobles during the period of missionary activity in Matamba following the establishment of the Capuchin mission in 1656. She appears to have always regarded herself as a Christian. ==Reign== Ver√≥nica came to power following the Portuguese war against Matamba in 1681 in which her predecessor and brother was killed at the Battle of Katole. Although her brother was killed in the action, the forces of Matamba won the battle and the Portuguese withdrew their army. Nevertheless, Queen Ver√≥nica decided to treat for peace, signing the agreement with Portugal in 1683. This peace treaty would govern relations between Portugal and Matamba for a long time to come, but was, in fact rarely followed by either participant. Resuming of hostilities In 1689 she attacked the Portuguese in Cahenda in the \\"Dembos\\" region to her west, an area that was disputed between Ndongo, Kongo, and Portugal. She was anxious to reestablish Matamba's claims over the Dembos region that lay directly to the east of Matamba, and in 1688‚Äì89 her armies moved into the area and threatened Portuguese positions around Ambaca, their fortified town that marked the westernmost edge of the colony of Angola. The Portuguese intervened, and blunted the effectiveness of the campaign. In around 1701, Luca da Caltanisetta, the prefect of the Capuchin mission in Angola wrote to her asking to re-establish the mission which had fallen vacant, and \\"to return that people to the granary of the Holy Church.\\" Ver√≥nica, whose country had \\"not fallen entirely back to heathendom\\" wrote back a pious letter expressing her concern that \\"it pained her to see her children die without baptism\\" but that she was \\"disgusted with the whites,\\" and she would \\"not see any of them in her court with the missionaries.\\"Archivio \\"De Propaganda Fide\\" (Rome), series Scritture Originali nelli Congregazioni Generali, vol. 552, fol. 66, Account of Bernardo da Firenze, 1710 She sought once again to expand the kingdom into Portuguese domains in 1706, and it was probably for this reason that she had ambassadors in the court of Kongo's King Pedro IV that year. But her attempts to do this were thwarted, as Portuguese forces were too strong and she abandoned the attempt. Nevertheless, a state of constant low level conflict between her army and the Portuguese at Ambaca and Cahenda led to the virtual depopulation of the country to the west of Matamba, as the people either fled or were captured and deported to the Americas. Those captured by the Portuguese tended to be sent to Brazil, those captured by Ver√≥nica were often sold to Vili merchants, based in the Kingdom of Loango to the north, and subsequently sold to English, Dutch, or French merchants who frequented that coast. Ver√≥nica continued her attempts to expand Matamba's control over the territories that it claimed in the early seventeenth century.

Over 6,500 students study at the college each year. West Thames College was last inspected in November 2017. The outcome is still to be announced. West Thames College also gained national Beacon Awards for Equality and Diversity in 2008 and 2009. The college offers a wide range of A Levels and specialist vocational courses up to higher education level: BTECs, NVQs, City & Guilds, Foundation Degrees and HNDs. The college has a reputation for its creative arts courses, especially specialist makeup. Students have won the International Makeup Artist Trade Show (IMATS) 5 times. ==Isleworth Campus== Spring Grove House (formerly Pears House) in 1988 The main college campus in Isleworth includes the Grade II listed Spring Grove House ‚Äì once the home of 18th century botanist and explorer Sir Joseph Banks ‚Äì and modern buildings such as the Millennium Building (built 1999, refurbished 2008 and extended 2010), the Atrium Building (opened 2010) and the Sir Joseph Banks Building (opened 2011).

There are also modern leisure facilities for students including spacious common rooms and cafes. ==Feltham Campus== The Feltham Skills Centre was officially opened in 2003 by former Prime Minister Gordon Brown, then Chancellor of the Exchequer. Around 650 students study practical vocational skills and training at the Skills Centre, including catering, plumbing, brickwork, painting and decorating, electrical installation, engineering, carpentry and motor vehicle maintenance. ==History== Spring Grove House, a Grade II listed building which forms part of the college's Isleworth campus, was the main country residence of Sir Joseph Banks from 1779 to his death in 1820 (he purchased the freehold in 1808). Banks carried out scientific experiments in the grounds of the house and Queen Charlotte visited Banks and his wife there in 1813. The first recorded house on the site was built around 1645. Elisha Biscoe bought this house in 1754, demolished it and built Spring Grove House. After Biscoe's death, his son leased the house to Banks. Spring Grove House was substantially rebuilt and extended by its later owners, Henry Pownall in the mid 19th century and Andrew Pears in the late 19th century. It is an excellent example of late Victorian architecture and interior design, with a fine Georgian room as an added bonus. The ground floor rooms of the building were sensitively restored and redecorated in 2011. In 1922 the house was purchased by Middlesex County Council. It opened in that year as the new site of Hounslow Polytechnic (renamed Spring Grove Polytechnic) which had been established in 1892 and had used premises in Hanworth Road. The following year Spring Grove Secondary School moved to the house, sharing the building with the Polytechnic who offered almost entirely evening classes. In 1946 Spring Grove Secondary School became Spring Grove Grammar School. It moved to new premises in Lampton in 1959 and Spring Grove House was taken over by Isleworth Polytechnic as a full- time college. The college was renamed Hounslow Borough College in 1976. In 1993 the college acquired incorporated status and was renamed West Thames College. Spring Grove House is open to the public one Saturday every September as part of Open House London. ==Notable alumni== *Anne-Marie Duff, actress (Shameless, Nowhere Boy, The Virgin Queen) *Freddie Mercury, lead vocalist of Queen, studied at the college when it was known as Isleworth Polytechnic *Rufus Sewell, actor (Zen, Pillars of the Earth) *Martin Hancock, actor (Defiance, Coronation Street, Holby City) *Celena Cherry, lead singer with the Honeyz *Mark Morriss and Scott Morriss of the Bluetones ==ReferencesExternal links== * West Thames College official site * Ofsted Inspection reports Category:Further education colleges in London Category:Education in the London Borough of Hounslow Category:Isleworth ","title":"West Thames College"},{"id":"5601530","text":"The Trenton Bath House is a pivotal, influential design by the architect Louis Kahn, with the help of his associate, renowned architect Anne Tyng,http://kahntrentonbathhouse.org/bathHouse.htm at 999 Lower Ferry Road, Ewing Township, Mercer County, New Jersey, United States. It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. Exterior A corner of the bath house It is neither in Trenton, New Jersey, nor is it a bath house, but the so-called \\"Trenton Bath House\\" commands attention from architectural historians around the world. Designed as part of a larger plan (never executed) for the Jewish Community Center of the Delaware Valley, the \\"bath house\\" opened in 1955 and served as the entrance and changing area for patrons of an outdoor swimming pool. From a design perspective, the bath house actually appears as a simple cruciform‚Äîfour square concrete block rooms or areas, surrounding an open atrium. Each of the rooms is topped by a simple, wooden rectangular pyramid. At the corner of each room there is a large, open rectangular column that supports the roof. However, closer inspection reveals that in addition to the pure design elegance, Kahn also clarified his thinking about the utilitarian purposes of the various spaces, and it was in this building that he first articulated his notion of spaces serving and spaces served.

Cork Rock: From Rory Gallagher to the Sultans of Ping. Cork: South Bank Press, 2016. p. 126. Setanta published UK and Irish indie music in the late 1980s and in the 1990s. ==History== Setanta Records was started in a Camberwell, London squat by former bicycle courier Keith Cullen. Their first success came when Dublin band Into Paradise received positive reviews from the British music press for their Setanta debut titled Under the Water. Major label interest followed and Into Paradise subsequently signed to Ensign Records retaining Cullen as band manager. Shortly thereafter, Cullen signed the Cork trio the Frank and Walters, who wore orange shirts and purple flared trousers. As with Into Paradise, the band signed to Go! Discs retaining Cullen as band manager. The Frank and Walters achieved minor commercial success when their song \\"After All\\" peaked at number 11 on the UK Singles Chart. Commercial success followed Cullen's signing of the Divine Comedy whose first three albums Liberation, Promenade and Casanova were well received in the UK and Europe. The Divine Comedy also provided the soundtrack for the Channel 4 sitcom Father Ted. Despite label boss Cullen not thinking that the song was commercially promising, Setanta also had chart success with the Edwyn Collins (former frontman of Scotland's Orange Juice on Postcard Records) hit \\"A Girl Like You\\" which went on to become successful in several national charts. In the late 1990s, the label turned down the Magnetic Fields' album 69 Love Songs, which ended up being a critical and commercial success. In 2007, Setanta signed London band The Tacticians. Their debut album Some Kind of Urban Fulfilment was released on Setanta in August 2007. In 2012, Cullen announced that he was closing Setanta down. == Selected artists == *A House *Adrian Borland *Catchers *The Chalets *Evan Dando *The Divine Comedy *Edwyn Collins *Five Go Down to the Sea?O'Neill, Ryan. \\"Cork remembers post-punk icon Finbarr Donnelly.

It is situated on the river Kinzig, 5 km northeast of Hanau. It was formed in 1970 by the merger, in 1970, of the towns of Langendiebach and R√ºckingen. The name deduces from the abundant alders at the lakes (Erlen=alders, See=lake) in this area. ==Geography== Neighboring Communities In the north it borders the town Bruchk√∂bel and the municipality Neuberg. In the east it borders the town Langenselbold and the municipality Rodenbach. In the southwest it borders Hanau. Districts Langendiebach and R√ºckingen ==Transportation== Erlensee is located close to three major German autobahnen (motorways). The E42 (A3) connects the Ruhr Area (German: Ruhrgebiet) with Frankfurt am Main and further towards Bavaria (German: Bayern) with cities like Aschaffenburg, W√ºrzburg and Nuremberg (German: N√ºrnberg). The E41 (A45) connects the cities like Gie√üen in the north and Aschaffenburg in the south. The A66 is the main connection between Frankfurt and Hanau at the south-west end and Fulda at the north-east end. Two bus lines connect Erlensee with Hanau and Langenselbold on the one hand and Hanau and Neuberg/Ronneburg on the other hand. Erlensee is member of the Rhein-Main-Verkehrsverbund (RMV), a public transport network, so you can reach all other connected places around Frankfurt with one ticket. The ICE (German high-speed train-)station in Hanau is reachable within 10 minutes by car. The Frankfurt Airport is approximately 35 minutes away by car. ==History== R√ºckingen was first mentioned in 1173 as \\"Rukkingin\\". Langendiebach was first mentioned in 1226 as \\"Dyppach\\". In 1937 the Luftwaffe built an airfield known as Langendiebach Fliegerhorst. World War II limited plans to expand it into a larger airfield. Glider and nightfighter units of the German Air Force stationed here participated in the 1939 invasion of Poland and the 1944-45 defense of Germany against allied invasion. Multiple bombings by allied forces rendered the airfield unserviceable by the war's end. Under the name Fliegerhorst Kaserne American forces occupied the facilities from 1945 until 2007 with artillery, aviation, ordnance, quartermaster, transportation, meteorological, and military police units.

This is then shaved, with axe or knife, to produce as many curls as possible. While the flakes can be fairly coarse, the finer they are shaved the more easily they ignite. When used in conjunction with char cloth, a small piece of charcloth is wound around the curls and a spark is struck on to it, using either the traditional flint and steel or a modern ferrocerium striker.

These are marine heterobranch gastropod mollusks, or micromollusks, in the family Pyramidellidae. ==Taxonomy== The subfamily Odostomiinae has been recognized as monophyletic. It includes the tribe Liostomini, a name given to those genera which have an intorted protoconch. The rest of the genera however do not form a single monophyletic taxon. Subfamily Odostomiinae has been classified as one of eleven recognised subfamilies of the very voluminous gastropod family Pyramidellidae (according to the taxonomy of Ponder & Lindberg 1997): Odostomiinae, Turbonillinae, Chrysallidinae, Cingulininae, Cyclostremellinae, Sayellinae, Syrnolinae, Eulimellinae, Pyramidellinae, Odostomellinae and Tiberiinae. In the taxonomy of Bouchet & Rocroi (2005), this subfamily also comprises the subfamilies Chrysallidinae, Cyclostremellinae and Odostomellinae, that they have downgraded to the rank of tribe. subfamily Odostomiinae Pelseneer, 1928 *tribe Odostomiini Pelseneer, 1928 *tribe Chrysallidini Saurin, 1958 - formerly subfamily Chrysallidinae *tribe Cyclostremellini D.R.

Most species in the subfamily have shells which are smaller than 13 mm. The texture of these shells is most often smooth but sometimes sculptured in various forms such as ribs and spirals. Their color is mostly white, cream or yellowish, sometimes with red or brown lines. The teleoconch is dextrally coiled, but the larval shells are sinistral. This results in a sinistrally coiled protoconch. The columella has usually one, but sometimes several, spiral folds. The aperture is closed by an operculum. ==Life habits== The Odostomiinae are ectoparasites, feeding mainly on other molluscs and on annelid worms, but some are known to feed on peanut worms and crustaceans. They do not have a radula. Instead their long proboscis is used to pierce the skin of its prey and suck up its fluids and soft tissues. The eyes on the grooved tentacles are situated toward the base of the tentacles. Between the head and the foot, a lobed process called the mentum ( = thin projection) is visible. These molluscs are hermaphrodites. ==References== Category:Pyramidellidae Category:Protostome subfamilies ","title":"Odostomiinae"},{"id":"5601590","text":"Charles MacArthur Kornegay Jr. (born September 28, 1974) is a Spanish-American former professional basketball player.

The mouth is of moderate size extending to nearly below the anterior margin of the eye: it is more extensive on the blind side, and has two rows of teeth in each jaw. The nostrils have a higher and more anterior position than on the right side. Gill-rakers are small, conical, and smooth, slightly fenibriated on the inner side. About thirteen in number on the lower limb, scarcely developed on the hinder one. Gills three and a half, a slit behind the last, equal to the diameter of the eye. The gill openings are small, not extending to the upper angle of the pectoral above, and closed below the preopercular angle beneath. Fins.‚ÄîThe dorsal commences on the rostral process, about an eye diameter from its extremity. Though partially free anteriorly, all the rays are connected by membrane. They are highest about the middle of the fin where they form a conspicuous angle, the thirty-fifth or longest ray being 1*9 in the length of the head. The rays are continued to within an eye-diameter of the caudal rays. The ventral commences beneath the middle of the eye and is quite continuous with the anal, the apparent omission of one ray only indicating the distinction. The vent is situated on the left side contiguous to this space. The anal is similar to the dorsal the sixteenth ray being the longest. The right pectoral is pointed above, its length being 1.5 in the length of the head: the left fin is shorter, 1 '9 in the same, and is symmetrical, the central rays being the longest. The caudal is truncate or very slightly rounded, and the depth of the peduncle is 2.2 in the head. Scales.‚ÄîThe forepart of the head, the interorbital space, the margins of the opercula and the bases of the pectorals are naked. The body is covered on both sides with cycloid scales, non-imbricate on the anterior portion, but overlapping behind, and upon the caudal peduncle. Fins scaleless. The lateral line runs almost straight, there being a slight curve over the anterior half of the pectoral, which is less marked on the blind side; anteriorly on both sides, the line is continued over the head to the base of the seventh or eighth dorsal ray.

The film, released by Warner Bros. and directed by Irving Rapper tells a fictional coming of age story about a young Jewish girl in New York City in the 1950s. The film's trajectory traces Marjorie Morgenstern's attempts to become an artist - exemplified through her relationship with the actor and playwright Noel Airman. The film's cast includes Natalie Wood, Gene Kelly, and Claire Trevor. The central conflict in the film revolves around the traditional models of social behavior and religious behavior expected by New York Jewish families in the 1950s, and Marjorie's desire to follow an unconventional path. The film is notable for its inclusion of Jewish religious scenes - including a Passover meal, a synagogue sequence and Jewish icons in the Morgenstern house. These depictions were one of the first times Jewish religion was portrayed overtly in film since The Jazz Singer in 1927. The movie received an Oscar nomination for Best Song (\\"A Very Precious Love\\"), sung by Gene Kelly. ==Synopsis== Marjorie Morgenstern is a student at Hunter College and the girlfriend of an eligible young man, Sandy Lamm, who attends her family's synagogue. Her parents are happy with her choice of mate, and her mother Rose Morgenstern (Claire Trevor) tells her father, Arnold (Everett Sloane), that she hopes the two kids marry. Marjorie breaks up with the boy, though, and goes to the Catskills that summer to be a camp counselor. One night, Marjorie and friend Marsha Zelenko (Carolyn Jones) sneak to a Borscht Belt resort for adults called South Wind. There she is caught by resort owner Maxwell Greech (George Tobias), but social director Noel Airman (Gene Kelly) vouches for Marjorie as a guest and offers her a job, beginning a relationship with Airman and a friendship with aspiring playwright Wally Wronkin (Martin Milner), who writes Airman's stage act. The latter has a romantic interest in Marjorie, but she's tempted by the older, cynical Airman, who meets the disapproval of her parents. Airman, whose original name was the more Jewish Ehrman, renames Marjorie as well from Morgenstern to Morningstar. Marjorie's sweet Uncle Samson (Ed Wynn) comes to the resort to keep an eye on her. But when he dies of a heart attack while entertaining guests, Marjorie goes back to the city. There she dates a doctor named Harris, with whom she quickly breaks up when Airman returns to find her. He declares that love has convinced him to become respectable. Marjorie tells her mother, who insists her daughter bring him to a Passover meal. \\"Not Passover, mother. He‚Äôs not very religious. He doesn‚Äôt believe in those things,\\" Marjorie says. Rose answers, \\"He doesn‚Äôt believe in those things... you‚Äôre going to get married. How are you going to raise your children?\\" In the midst of the Passover meal, he leaves and Marjorie follows him. She is concerned he's bored, but he says, \\"I wasn‚Äôt bored. I was disturbed, deeply. I couldn‚Äôt help thinking of all the things I‚Äôve missed in life. Family, your kind of family. Faith, tradition. All the things I‚Äôve been ridiculing all the time. That‚Äôs why I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. I love you very much, Marjorie Morgenstern.\\" Airman gets a job at an advertising firm and seems to do well. But one week he doesn't show up to work and refuses to take Marjorie's calls. She goes to his apartment and finds him drunk with a strange woman, Imogene Norman. He has decided he cannot stand the professional lifestyle and wants to be an artist. The impetus to change careers is the success of Wally Wronkin on Broadway; the playwright has launched a series of hits and Airman is consumed with jealousy. Airman and Marjorie reconcile when girlfriend Marsha's new husband agrees to invest in his play. But it gets panned by critics. \\"We were crucified,\\" someone explains to Marjorie, and their relationship is unable to survive. He runs away, again; she chases after him, even to Europe. In the end, Wally tells her Noel is back at the resort, where all first met. Marjorie returns to South Wind, where she watches Noel rehearsing a new summer show. Everything is exactly the same as it was, her first summer there, except for herself. Greech observes that she's done some growing up. We see her board a bus. In the rearview mirror, Wronkin sits in back. He smiles, as he's been waiting for her to get over her summer fling. The suggestion is that they will embark on the relationship Wronkin had been hoping for from the beginning. ==Cast== * Gene Kelly as Noel Airman * Natalie Wood as Marjorie * Claire Trevor as Rose Morgenstern * Everett Sloane as Arnold Morgenstern * Martin Milner as Wally Wronkin * Carolyn Jones as Marsha Zelenko * George Tobias as Greech * Martin Balsam as Dr. Harris * Jesse White as Lou Michelson * Edd Byrnes as Sandy Lamm * Paul Picerni as Philip Berman * Alan Reed as Puddle Podell * Ruta Lee as Imogene Norman * Ed Wynn as Uncle Samson ==Production== Natalie Wood, who would later go on to her greatest hit, West Side Story, had until Marjorie Morningstar played mostly childish roles, including that of Judy in Rebel Without a Cause. A NY Times reviewer wrote of her performance, \\"Natalie Wood, who only yesterday was playing with dolls in films, has blossomed into a vivacious pretty brunette who very likely is as close to a personification of Marjorie as one could wish. But the character is hardly complex, and while Miss Wood is competent in the role, it is rarely a glowing performance.\\" Gene Kelly was near the end of his film career when he appeared in Marjorie Morningstar. His 15-year association with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer had ended the previous year. Born in 1912, he was 46 when he took the role of Noel Airman. By contrast, his love interest Wood was only 20 years old. The Times noted: \\"Although Mr. Kelly appears a mite uncomfortable in his assignment, he plays it with understanding. And, as a professional song-and-dance man, he both hoofs with polish and pleasingly warbles 'A Very Precious Love,' the film's theme number.\\" Times critiques of the other performances: \\"Carolyn Jones, as Miss Wood's best friend, makes it an outspoken performance marked by one truly poignant scene in which she reveals her essential loneliness. Ed Wynn, in the comparatively short role of an impecunious but understanding relative, adds some glint of humor and compassion. Claire Trevor, as Marjorie's over- protective mother and Martin Milner, as the playwright, who is one of Marjorie's retinue of devoted suitors, are well-turned, if not inspired, characterizations.\\" The footage of fictitious Camp Tamarack was filmed at Camp Cayuga, Schroon Lake, N.Y. in Essex County, N.Y.https://www.summercampculture.com/marjorie-morningstar-1958/ Part of the film was filmed in Glens Falls, N.Y. in Warren County, N.Y.https://www.glensfallsliving.com/blog/back-in-the-day-marjorie- morningstar?fbclid=IwAR2OHV-9RvXaGA2sWNYJn6Q3HhCuo8nyLEflrhCt69e40VDyXzdzS8atOUI/ ==Differences between the film and novel== The most significant difference between the 1955 novel and the 1958 film is the ending. At the end of the novel, the free-spirited Marjorie Morningstar settles down with a man agreeable to her parents. In a criticism of Herman Wouk's ending, Alana Newhouse writes in Slate Magazine that \\"In the final nine pages, the formerly vibrant Marjorie gives up on her career, gets married to a man named Sidney ‚Äî er, Milton ‚Äî Schwartz, and moves to Westchester... Most female readers cry when they reach the end of this book, and for good reason. Marjorie Morningstar, as they came to know her, has become another woman entirely: 'You couldn't write a play about her that would run a week, or a novel that would sell a thousand copies. ‚Ä¶ The only remarkable thing about Mrs. Schwartz is that she ever hoped to be remarkable, that she ever dreamed of being Marjorie Morningstar.'\\" The film's ending suggests a possible relationship between Marjorie and Wally Wronkin, the playwright. Although he is successful, he is far more artistic than the Milton Schwartz that Marjorie settles for at the end of the novel. This ending suggests a different conceit in the film than Wouk's novel. The novel suggests that people grow up to realize they have no real choice but to follow their family and upbringing. The film's ending suggests that maturity implies assuming responsibility for one's choices and finishing what was started. Wally had been waiting for Marjorie to learn that Noel will never mature in this sense. In the novel the moral seems to be that her only solution is to settle, as her Mother warns her, for someone to take care of her. In the movie, she begins a new journey. The film is also contemporary, set in the late 1950s; whereas, the novel is set in the 1930s. ==See also== * List of American films of 1958 ==References== * Popkin, Henry.

The shell of most species are rather high and slender. The texture of these shells is usually ribbed sculptured in various forms and often also have more or less prominent spirals. Their color is mostly white, cream or yellowish, sometimes with red or brown lines. The adult shell, the teleoconch is dextrally coiled, but the larval shells are sinistral. This results in a sinistrally coiled protoconch. The opening of the shell, the aperture is closed by a lid, a so called operculum. ==Life habits== The Turbonillinae are ectoparasites, feeding mainly on other molluscs and on annelid worms. They do not have a radula. Instead their long proboscis is used to pierce the skin of its prey and suck up its fluids and soft tissues. The eyes on the grooved tentacles are situated toward the base of the tentacles. Between the head and the foot, a lobed process called the mentum (= thin projection) is visible. These molluscs are hermaphrodites. ==References== Category:Pyramidellidae Category:Taxa named by Heinrich Georg Bronn ","title":"Turbonillinae"},{"id":"5601650","text":"Michael White (29 December 1948 - 4 April 2008) was an Australian social worker and family therapist.

The library was opened in 1895, with the baths following in 1907. Made of red brick and terracotta in Edwardian style, the structure is one of only three swimming pools in the country listed at Grade II* status. The buildings are currently managed by Birmingham City Council, however, the council has announced plans to close the baths in June 2017. ==History== Planning During discussions in 1890 to absorb the Balsall Heath district into the city of Birmingham, it was decided that public baths should be built as soon as possible for the area if Birmingham was to acquire the district. A bill was passed and Balsall Heath was annexed into Birmingham on 1 October 1891. The City of Birmingham Baths Department was then instructed to find an appropriate site for the construction of public baths in the area. Working in conjunction with the Free Libraries Committee (a library had also been promised to the residents of Balsall Heath as part of the arrangement which absorbed their district into Birmingham) the Baths Department soon located a site on Moseley Road close to the junction with Edward Road. A small cartway known as Midland Grove ran behind the site and the access this offered for the delivery of coal to the rear of the building was a key factor in the decision to choose this particular site. Construction and opening The Free Library opened in 1895 and has a clock tower. It was designed by Jethro A. Cossins and F. B. Peacock. The baths were added immediately to the south and were opened on 30 October 1907, much later than planned owing to severe delays experienced in boring a well on the premises. They were designed by William Hale and Son of 83, Colmore Row, and cost almost ¬£34,000. As was common practice at the time, there were separate entrances for first-class males, second-class males, and women. Initially, only the 'slipper' bath departments were opened, with the pools coming into operation on 1 March 1908, the start of the municipal swimming season. On 21 November 1908, the first-class pool was floored over and the space subsequently used for social activities. It was one of several public baths to begin these activities in the winter months as there was little demand for the pools during this time of year. Subsequent history The baths were used as a makeshift hospital in the early years of World War II. An additional entrance was created to facilitate this purpose, which was subsequently used as a fire exit from Pool 2. By the end of 2010 a steel beam used to support the wall and roof above it had become severely corroded, leading to the pool's closure as this part of the building was in danger of collapse. Today, the library remains a functioning branch of Birmingham Library Services. The baths, run by Birmingham City Council, reopened following extensive structural work during 2005. They stand opposite the College of Art and were listed at Grade II as a single entity in 1982, upgraded to Grade II* status in 2004 by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. In 2006 a Friends of Moseley Road Baths group was formed to campaign for the long-term future of the building as a fully functioning swimming facility. Since their formation various community events and fundraisers have been held, including the centenary celebration on 30 October 2007 which was attended by the Lord Mayor of Birmingham and swimmers past and present. In 2010 the Friends' group was awarded a Heritage Lottery Fund grant of ¬£48,000 to document the building's history and to interview former and current users of the building. Some aspects of the project are now online. ==Facilities== The public library with its clock tower The baths building consists of two swimming pools (the first-class or \\"Gala\\" pool and the second-class pool), three 'slipper' bath departments (men's first-class, men's second-class, and women's) comprising a total of 46 private washing baths, a committee room which was primarily used for meetings of swimming clubs, a flat formerly used by the resident money-taker, a boiler house containing two 1950s coal-fired boilers and a water filter room containing two filtration tanks dating from the 1930s. The boiler house has three levels: ground contains the boilers, first floor contains the laundry room, second floor contain a large cast iron cold-water storage tank. The building has three entrances, all of which led to a central booking desk. The first-class men's entrance led to Pool 1 and the first-class 'slipper' baths department. The second-class men's entrance led to Pool 2 and the second-class 'slipper' baths. The women's entrance led to the women's 'slipper' baths department. Originally all bathers were supplied with a towel, soap and (for swimmers) a costume, collected from the baths attendant's kiosk. Towels and costumes were subsequently washed and dried in the steam laundry room located on the first floor of the boiler house. Pool 1 is grand in its detailing. It contains 63 glazed brick cubicles, a three-sided spectator gallery, cast iron roof trusses and bowed, wrought iron balconettes. Pool 2 is less ornate and was the second-class pool. Pool 2 did not originally have cubicles and bathers changed on benches around the pool side. ==Future== The building reopened in April 2012 after 16 months of structural work on the fire exit of Pool 2, asbestos removal from the basement, and extensive cleaning and painting. Pool 2 is currently open for swimming and is well used, but Pool 1 has been closed since 2003. The second-class 'slipper' baths were in continual use until October 2004, but have since closed. In January 2017 it was reported that the council plans to close the baths in June 2017. The Friends' group and MRB Action Group are attempting to create an organisation to further restore the neglected building and operate the baths to save them from closure. It was announced that the pool would continue to stay open. ==References== * *Victorian Architecture in Britain - Blue Guide, Julian Orbach, 1987, *The City of Birmingham Baths Department 1851-1951, J.

(The other 10 subfamilies are Odostomiinae, Turbonillinae, Cingulininae, Cyclostremellinae, Sayellinae, Syrnolinae, Eulimellinae, Pyramidellinae, Odostomellinae and Tiberiinae.) According to Schander, Van Aartsen & Corgan (1999) there are 47 genera in this subfamily, four additional genera may also be a part of this taxon. In the taxonomy of Bouchet & Rocroi (2005), this subfamily has been downgraded to the rank of tribe Chrysallidini in the subfamily Odostomiinae. ==Genera== Genera in the subfamily Chrysallidinae include: * Chrysallida Carpenter, 1856 - type genus * Babella Dall, & Bartsch, 1906 * Bartrumella Laws, 1940 * Besla Dall & Bartsch, 1904 * Boonea Robertson, 1978 * Egila Dall, & Bartsch, 1904 * Euparthenia Thiele, 1929 * Eupyrgulina Melvill, 1910 * Eurathea Laseron, 1959 * Evalina Dall & Bartsch, 1904 * Fargoa Bartsch, 1955 * Folinella Dall, & Bartsch, 1904 * Gurmatia Dance & Eames, 1966 * Haldra Dall, & Bartsch, 1904 * Helodiamea Pe√±as & Rol√°n, 2017 * Hinemoa Oliver, 1915 * Iolaea A.

The texture of these shells is sculptured in various forms such as ribs and spirals. Their color is mostly white, cream or yellowish. The teleoconch is dextrally coiled, but the larval shells are sinistral. This results in a sinistrally coiled protoconch. The columella has one, spiral fold. The aperture is closed by an operculum. ==Life habits== The Chrysallidinae are ectoparasites, feeding mainly on other molluscs and on annelid worms. They do not have a radula. Instead their long proboscis is used to pierce the skin of its prey and suck up its fluids and soft tissues. The eyes on the grooved tentacles are situated toward the base of the tentacles. Between the head and the foot, a lobed process called the mentum ( = thin projection) is visible. These molluscs are hermaphrodites, laying eggs in jelly-like masses on the shell of its host. ==References== Category:Pyramidellidae ","title":"Chrysallidini"},{"id":"5601691","text":"Linden is a town in the district of Gie√üen, in Hesse, Germany.

In New Jersey, the route runs from the Cape May‚ÄìLewes Ferry terminal in North Cape May, Cape May County, where the ferry carries US 9 across the Delaware Bay to Lewes, Delaware, north to the George Washington Bridge in Fort Lee, Bergen County, where the route along with Interstate 95 (I-95) and US 1 continue into New York City. US 9 is the longest U.S. highway in the state. From North Cape May north to Toms River in Ocean County, US 9 is mostly a two-lane undivided road that closely parallels the Garden State Parkway and runs near the Jersey Shore. Along this stretch, it passes through the communities of Rio Grande, Cape May Court House, Somers Point, Pleasantville, Absecon, Tuckerton, Manahawkin, Beachwood and Berkeley Township. In the Toms River area, US 9 runs along the Garden State Parkway for a short distance before heading northwest away from it and the Jersey Shore into Lakewood Township. Upon entering Monmouth County, the route transitions into a multilane suburban divided highway and continues through Howell Township, Freehold Township, Manalapan Township, Marlboro Township, Old Bridge Township, Sayreville, and South Amboy. In Woodbridge Township, US 9 merges with US 1 and the two routes continue through northern New Jersey as US 1/9 to the George Washington Bridge. Prior to 1927, the current alignment of US 9 had been legislated as parts of several state highways, including pre-1927 Route 14 from Cape May to Seaville, pre-1927 Route 19 between Seaville and Absecon, pre-1927 Route 4 between Absecon and Lakewood and South Amboy and Rahway, pre-1927 Route 7 Spur between Lakewood and Freehold, and pre-1927 Route 1 between Rahway and Jersey City. US 9 was signed through New Jersey in 1926 to run from US 30 in Absecon north to the New York border in Alpine, where it became US 9W; it ran more to the east of its current alignment between Lakewood and South Amboy. In 1927, US 9 became Route 4 between Absecon and Lakewood and South Amboy and Rahway, Route 35 between Lakewood and Belmar and Eatontown and South Amboy (now Route 88 south of Point Pleasant), Route 4N (now Route 71) between Belmar and Eatontown, Route 27 between Rahway and Newark, Route 25 between Newark and Jersey City, and New Jersey Route 1 north of Jersey City. By the 1940s, US 9 had been extended south on Route 4 to Cape May and rerouted to current Route 4 between Lakewood and South Amboy. In addition, the route was moved to its current alignment between South Amboy and Jersey City, following Route 35 and Route 25, and routed to cross the Hudson River on the George Washington Bridge, using a part of Route 6. The state highway concurrencies were removed in 1953 and two realignments occurred to the route as a result of the construction of the Garden State Parkway in the 1950s. In the 1970s, US 9 was extended across the Cape May‚ÄìLewes Ferry to continue into Delaware with the former route into Cape May becoming Route 109. Also around this time, two freeways were proposed for US 9 in Atlantic and Monmouth counties, but never built. The Beesley's Point Bridge over Great Egg Harbor Bay was closed in 2004, with US 9 rerouted to use the Great Egg Harbor Bridge along the Garden State Parkway. ==Route description== Cape May County From the Cape May Terminal of the Cape May‚ÄìLewes Ferry, which carries US 9 across the Delaware Bay to Lewes, Delaware, US 9 continues north on Ferry Road, a divided highway with one northbound lane and three southbound lanes which is under the maintenance of the Delaware River and Bay Authority. The road soon turns east and becomes four-lane divided Lincoln Boulevard. It runs between the residential community of North Cape May to the north and wetlands to the south within Lower Township, Cape May County. The road becomes Sandman Boulevard at the intersection with CR 603, where it enters woodland and narrows into a two- lane undivided road. After a turn southeast, US 9 comes to a crossroads with CR 626, which heads south to cross the Cape May Canal as Route 162. After crossing the Cape May Seashore Lines railroad tracks, US 9 turns north onto Shore Road, while Route 109 continues straight to head into Cape May. Shore Road, which is maintained by the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT), carries the route northward through a mix of woods and marshland containing some development, with the Cape May Seashore Lines tracks running immediately to the west and the Garden State Parkway a short distance to the east. The road passes near Historic Cold Spring Village prior to a brief bend farther to the east of the railroad tracks as the route continues through Erma. US 9 southbound past the CR 601 intersection in Middle TownshipUS 9 crosses into Middle Township, where it continues northeast into the commercial community of Rio Grande. Here, the road briefly widens to four lanes as it has an intersection with Route 47, which runs up the west bank of the cape. From this point, the two-lane route continues into a mix of woods and development. Heading into Burleigh, US 9 intersects Route 147 and CR 618. Route 147/CR 618, as well as Route 47, provide access to The Wildwoods resort area on the Jersey Shore. North of the Route 147 intersection, US 9 draws alongside the Garden State Parkway as it passes near the Wildwood Golf and Country Club. Shortly after pulling away from the Garden State Parkway once again, the highway continues into Cape May Court House, the county seat of Cape May County. In this community, US 9 runs past a mix of homes and businesses, intersecting Shellbay Avenue and CR 657, both of which provide access to the Garden State Parkway at interchanges. At the CR 657 intersection, US 9 briefly gains a center left-turn lane and passes west of the Cape Regional Medical Center. Upon leaving Cape May Court House, the route runs into more rural surroundings, and comes to an intersection with CR 609, which heads east to an interchange with the Garden State Parkway, and Zoo Road, which heads west to the Cape May County Park & Zoo. Past here, the road again draws closer to the parkway and comes to a ramp that provides access to the southbound direction of the parkway. Continuing northeast through more wooded development, US 9 intersects CR 601 before entering Dennis Township. A short distance later, in the community of Clermont, Route 83 splits off to the northwest. Past this intersection, US 9 continues northeast through more rural areas, reaching an intersection with CR 625 after passing by Magnolia Lake. Following the CR 625 intersection, the road comes to CR 550, which heads to the west. Not long after the CR 550 intersection, US 9 continues into Upper Township, where it passes rural development before reaching Seaville. Here, there is an intersection with the southern terminus of Route 50 and a ramp providing access to the southbound direction of the Garden State Parkway and from the northbound direction of the Garden State Parkway. At this intersection, the route is briefly a divided highway. Past this junction, the road continues northeast, where residential development becomes more constant alongside the road as it passes through Palermo. US 9 reaches the community of Marmora, where it heads into commercial areas and briefly becomes a divided highway as it intersects CR 623. At this intersection, US 9 turns southeast to join CR 623 on Roosevelt Boulevard, while Shore Road continues north into Beesleys Point to a dead end at the site of the former Beesley's Point Bridge; this section of Shore Road is still inventoried as part of US 9 by NJDOT even though it no longer carries through traffic along US 9 since the bridge was closed and demolished. US 9/CR 623 runs southeast as five-lane road with a center left-turn lane that passes businesses. The road comes to an interchange with the Garden State Parkway, with a park-and-ride lot located within the northwest quadrant of the interchange. At this interchange, US 9 heads northeast on the four-lane limited-access parkway while CR 623 continues to Ocean City. The parkway, which has a wide median, carries the route through wooded areas between Beesleys Point to the west and marshland to the east. The median narrows as the highway comes to the Great Egg Harbor Bridge over the Great Egg Harbor Bay. Atlantic County US 9 southbound past CR 634 and CR 651 in AbseconThe highway crosses the Great Egg Harbor Bay into Egg Harbor Township, Atlantic County, where it runs across marshy Drag Island into Somers Point before passing over the Drag Channel. The parkway has a southbound toll plaza before US 9 leaves the roadway at a partial interchange. Now called New Road, the route runs through developed areas prior to crossing CR 559. The road winds east through the Greate Bay Golf Club before turning north and intersecting the northern terminus of Route 52, a route leading to Ocean City, and West Laurel Drive, which provides access to and from the northbound Garden State Parkway. At this intersection, the road contains a median. From this point, the two-lane undivided US 9 is lined with businesses and continues northeast, gaining a center left-turn lane prior to the CR 559 Alternate intersection. Here, the route enters Linwood and the turn lane ends as it heads through suburban areas. The road continues into Northfield, where it comes to CR 563. US 9 enters Pleasantville, intersecting US 40/US 322 (Black Horse Pike), a surface route to nearby Atlantic City to the east. The road turns more north-northeast past this intersection, crossing a trail and the Southern Railroad of New Jersey's Pleasantville Industrial Track line. The route reaches an interchange with the Atlantic City Expressway, the toll road leading into Atlantic City. After this interchange, US 9 crosses CR 646 and enters Absecon. The route crosses the marshy Absecon Creek prior to passing businesses. After crossing under NJ Transit‚Äôs Atlantic City Line, another route into Atlantic City, US 30 (White Horse Pike), crosses US 9. After US 30, the road turns east into wooded neighborhoods, becoming Wyoming Avenue. Route 157 intersects US 9 from the south, with US 9 making a left turn to head northeast onto Shore Road. The road continues into Galloway Township, with residential development becoming less dense as it runs a short distance to the west of inland bays, intersecting the southern terminus of CR 561. Past this intersection, US 9 draws farther from the inland bays and becomes New York Road. The road continues through dense woodland with some residences prior to reaching Smithville. Here, the road crosses CR 561 Alternate. Upon leaving the Smithville area, the land gets much more forested. The road turns slightly to the north-northwest as it crosses the marshy Nacote Creek, entering Port Republic and continuing north. After intersecting CR 575, the road passes a monument for the Battle of Chestnut Neck as it intersects Route 167. Following this intersection, US 9 turns west and merges onto the Garden State Parkway at an interchange. The limited-access parkway, which is six lanes wide, carries US 9 north through marshland to a crossing of the Mullica River. Pine Barrens US 9 northbound past CR 554 in Barnegat TownshipThis river crossing takes the two roads into Bass River Township, Burlington County, where US 9 merges off the Garden State Parkway. The route heads northwest onto two-lane undivided New York Road through woods, intersecting the northern terminus of the northern segment of Route 167. At this point, the route turns north and comes to a junction with CR 542. US 9 turns east into residential New Gretna before crossing under the Garden State Parkway without an interchange and passing over the marshy Bass River. This section runs along the eastern edge of the heavily forested Pine Barrens, with occasional areas of development. The road crosses the Balanger Creek into Little Egg Harbor Township in Ocean County, where US 9 becomes an unnamed road. Continuing east, the roadway enters Tuckerton and passes more dense development and the Tuckerton Seaport as \\"Main Street\\". US 9 crosses the Tuckerton Creek near Pohatcong Lake prior to intersecting the southern terminus of CR 539. From this point, the road resumes a north-northeast bearing, passing more areas of the Pine Barrens as it continues back into Little Egg Harbor Township and runs through Parkertown. Upon entering Eagleswood Township, US 9 passes through the residential community of West Creek. Continuing into Stafford Township, the route reaches Manahawkin, where development increases. In Manahawkin, Route 72, the main route to Long Beach Island, meets US 9 at a cloverleaf interchange. In the vicinity of the interchange, the road is a four-lane divided highway. After this interchange, the two-lane road passes more development before becoming more wooded. US 9 enters Barnegat Township, where it reaches the community of Barnegat, located a short distance to the west of the Barnegat Bay. In this community, there is an intersection with the eastern terminus of CR 554. Past this intersection, the route enters Ocean Township. In this area, US 9 comes to Waretown, where it intersects CR 532 in a commercial area. Leaving Waretown, the road heads north through areas of woodland and businesses before crossing the Oyster Creek into Lacey Township. Here, the road passes to the east of the former Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station before crossing over a branch of the Forked River. At this point, US 9 runs past businesses in the community of Forked River, turning back to the north-northeast. The land gets more built up as the road enters Lanoka Harbor. A crossing of the Cedar Creek takes the route into Berkeley Township and US 9 continues north as Atlantic City Boulevard. At Bayville, the route is lined with businesses and makes a turn to the northwest. The road briefly forms the border between Berkeley Township to the southwest and Pine Beach to the northeast prior to crossing into Beachwood. In Beachwood, Route 166 heads north as the route widens into a four-lane divided highway. Past Route 166, US 9 turns more to the west past residential neighborhoods as a four-lane undivided road, entering South Toms River, where it widens into a divided highway. US 9 crosses CR 530 prior to merging onto the Garden State Parkway again at another interchange. At this interchange, the southbound direction of US 9 briefly runs concurrent with eastbound CR 530. Toms River to Freehold US 9 northbound past CR 547 in Lakewood Township Joined with the eight-lane Garden State Parkway, US 9 briefly passes through Berkeley Township again before crossing the Toms River and entering the township of the same name. Here, the road reaches the exit for CR 527. Past CR 527, the road comes to a cloverleaf interchange with Route 37 at exit 82. US 9 leaves the Garden State Parkway again at the next exit, just before the Toms River Toll Plaza. At this point, the route intersects the northern terminus of Route 166 and heads north along Lakewood Road, a four-lane divided road that comes to an intersection with CR 571. Following this intersection, the road passes wooded suburban areas, turning more to the north-northwest. After a turn to the north, US 9 reaches an interchange with Route 70, a route connecting the northern part of the Jersey Shore to the Philadelphia area. After this junction, the road takes the name River Avenue as it comes into Lakewood Township. Upon entering Lakewood, the road passes commercial establishments containing Kimball Medical Center and running through tree-covered residential neighborhoods. After crossing Conrail Shared Assets Operations' (CSAO) Southern Secondary railroad line, the road passes to the east of Lake Carasaljo as it intersects CR 528/CR 547. At this intersection, CR 547 forms a concurrency with US 9 and the two routes continue north on Madsion Avenue, crossing the Metedeconk River, which Lake Carasaljo is formed from. After intersecting the western terminus of Route 88, Madison Avenue continues north through the commercial and residential center of Lakewood as a four-lane undivided road, with CR 547 splitting from US 9 by turning east. Entering a business area, the route crosses CR 526, turning into a divided highway called the Lila W. Thompson Memorial Highway. US 9 northbound at the I-195 interchange in Howell TownshipUS 9 enters Howell Township, Monmouth County at the point where it crosses over the North Branch Metedeconk River. The road runs north, lined with businesses and shopping centers as it has several intersections with jughandles. In this area, the route reaches an interchange with I-195, where US 9 begins a northwestward slant. After this interchange, the highway continues north and passes west of the Howell Park & Ride, with a bus stop next to the northbound lanes serving NJ Transit buses. Past here, the highway enters Freehold Township, where it crosses CR 524. Past this intersection, the route turns north and has an intersection with Route 79 before the interchange with the Route 33 freeway. Following Route 33, the highway continues northwest and passes southwest of the Freehold Mall, where a park-and-ride lot is located. The route enters Freehold Borough, the county seat of Monmouth County, as it has an interchange with CR 537. US 9 enters Freehold Township again as it passes between the Freehold Raceway Mall to the west and the Freehold Raceway to the east. The route turns north, widens to eight lanes, and intersects Route 33 Business at the former Freehold Circle. From this point, US 9 runs west of Freehold and east of Monmouth Battlefield State Park as a six-lane highway before crossing over CSAO's Freehold Industrial Track and CR 522, with ramps providing access to the latter. After this interchange, the highway narrows back to four lanes and intersects Schibanoff Lane, which leads west to the Freehold Township Commuter Lot. Freehold to US 1 US 9 northbound past the Symmes Drive/Ryan Road intersection in Manalapan Township The route enters Manalapan Township immediately after the Craig Road/East Freehold Road intersection, with a park-and-ride lot situated northwest of the intersection in a shopping center. In Manalapan Township, US 9 runs through more suburban areas and passes to the east of the Manalapan EpiCentre big‚Äìbox complex. The road crosses Symmes Drive/Ryan Road, where a park-and-ride lot is located on the northwest corner. US 9 reaches an interchange with CR 3 before passing a mix of farmland and development as it crosses into Marlboro Township. In Marlboro Township, businesses predominate the road as it reaches an interchange with Union Hill Road. Following this, US 9 continues north and crosses CR 520. The road enters Old Bridge Township, Middlesex County, where it becomes the Joann H. Smith Memorial Highway and interchanges with the Route 18 freeway. Within this interchange, the travel lanes of US 9 split. From Route 18, the route widens to six lanes as it eventually comes to interchanges with Throckmorton Lane/Ticetown Road and CR 516. Past CR 516, the highway passes a mix of woodland and farm fields and crosses Jake Brown Road, where a park-and-ride lot is located on the northeast corner of the intersection. Route 34 intersects US 9 at a directional interchange, with access from southbound US 9 to southbound Route 34 and from northbound Route 34 to northbound US 9. Missing movements between northbound Route 34 and southbound US 9 and northbound US 9 and southbound Route 34 are provided by Perrine Road to the south. From Route 34 through to the US 1/9 concurrency in Avenel, there are no jughandles or other intersections, just right-in/right-out access and interchanges. Past Route 34, the highway continues past the Old Bridge Park & Ride, with a bus terminal next to the northbound lanes serving NJ Transit buses, and several shopping centers, with a southbound exit and entrance serving the park-and-ride and one of the shopping centers. US 9 enters Sayreville, where it passes more suburban areas, interchanging with CR 673 and CR 615. A short distance after the latter, the road comes to a partial interchange with the Garden State Parkway at exit 123; this interchange only has access from the Parkway southbound to US 9 south and from US 9 north to the northbound parkway. US 9 narrows to four lanes past this interchange and runs northeast as it enters South Amboy. The route comes to an interchange with Route 35, merging onto that route for a concurrency. A single-lane, 10 mph ramp connects US 9 northbound to Route 35 northbound in South Amboy The concurrent US 9 and Route 35 head northwest on a four-lane divided highway through commercial areas and woodland, crossing over CSAO's Amboy Secondary before turning north and interchanging with CR 535 (Raritan Street) and Kearney Road, crossing back into Sayreville at the interchange with the former. At this point, the road widens to six lanes. The two routes split at an interchange (the former Victory Circle) that has access to the southbound Garden State Parkway and from the northbound Parkway by way of Chevalier Avenue. From here, US 9 closely parallels the east side of the Garden State Parkway as it crosses the Raritan River on the Edison Bridge, with the parkway crossing the river on the Driscoll Bridge. Upon crossing the Raritan River, US 9 enters Woodbridge Township, where it reaches a complex interchange with the Garden State Parkway, Route 440, and CR 656. Within this interchange, the Garden State Parkway‚Äôs travel lanes run in between the travel lanes of US 9, with this configuration continuing past the interchange for a short distance. Along this stretch, the road passes under CSAO's Perth Amboy Running Track line and there are ramps to and from CR 616 and to the parkway and the New Jersey Turnpike (I-95). After US 9 heads east away from the parkway, it reaches a cloverleaf interchange with Route 184/CR 501 and continues into a business district. A short distance later, the highway crosses over the access road between the Garden State Parkway and the New Jersey Turnpike just east of the toll plaza and then the New Jersey Turnpike itself. From this point, the highway passes several office parks, reaching an interchange with CR 514. After CR 514, the route passes some residential neighborhoods before passing to the east of the Woodbridge Center shopping mall. After passing under CSAO's Port Reading Secondary line, US 9 junctions with CR 604 prior to merging with US 1. US 1/9 concurrency US 1/9 northbound at the beginning of US 1/9 Truck in NewarkUS 1 and US 9 become concurrent upon merging in Woodbridge Township and continue through developed areas, interchanging with Route 35. Soon after this interchange, jughandles and other traffic light-controlled intersections resume. Upon entering Union County, US 1/9 pass through Rahway and Linden, interchanging with I-278 in Linden. The road continues into urban Elizabeth, crossing Route 439 before turning into a freeway prior to meeting Route 81 near Newark Liberty International Airport. US 1/9 continue along the west end of the airport into Newark, Essex County, reaching the Newark Airport Interchange with I-78, US 22, and Route 21. From this interchange, the road continues northeast through industrial areas to an interchange with US 1/9 Truck that provides access to the New Jersey Turnpike (I-95). US 1/9 continue onto the Pulaski Skyway, which carries the route over the Passaic River into Hudson County, crossing over Kearny and the Hackensack River before coming into Jersey City. Trucks are banned from the Pulaski Skyway and must use US 1/9 Truck to bypass it. The Pulaski Skyway ends at the Tonnele Circle with US 1/9 Truck and Route 139, and US 1/9 continue north along at-grade Tonnelle Avenue toward North Bergen, where the road intersects Route 3 and Route 495. Crossing into Bergen County, Broad Avenue carries US 1/9 through Fairview and Ridgefield before heading into Palisades Park. Here, the two routes join US 46, and the combined road heads north into Fort Lee. US 1/9/46 come to an interchange with I-95, US 9W, and Route 4, where it joins I-95 to head east to the George Washington Bridge over the Hudson River. At this point, US 46 ends and I-95 and US 1/9 continue into Manhattan, New York City on the Trans- Manhattan Expressway. ==Route 9 BBS== The Route 9 BBS, or bus bypass shoulder, are a part of the express bus system in Monmouth and MIddlesex counties. The road is used by NJ Transit's routes 63, 64, 67 to Hudson County, the 130, 132, 136, 139 to Port Authority Bus Terminal, and Academy Bus to Lower Manhattan. The bus lanes run for approximately in Old Bridge Township and are the first component of a planned BBS corridor into Monmouth and northern Ocean counties. An extensive analysis by consulting and planning firm Stantec released in 2010 includes recommendations regarding design, construction, and implementation of the BBS extension. The 2nd phase of the project would start at the project's southern end near the Lakewood Bus Terminal near Route 88. The third phase and final phase would connect the northern and southern segments passing through Freehold Township and proximate towns,l where work would include some widening and deepening of the roadbed to handle bus traffic. ==History== The Beesley's Point Bridge, which used to carry US 9 over the Great Egg Harbor Bay before it was closed in 2004 and demolished in 2013 What would become US 9 was originally part of a Lenape trail running from the Great Navesink Trail down to what is now Cape May.Snyder, John (1969). \\"The Story of New Jersey's Civil Boundaries 1606-1968\\" South of Cape May Courthouse, the road was part of the Cape May Turnpike, which also included parts of Seashore Drive and Route 109. Later the road from Cape May to Tom's River would become part of the Jersey Coast Way, stretching from Cape May to the Staten Island Ferry.Rand McNally and Co. \\"Eastern Ohio, Western Pennsylvania, South East Michigan, Southern Ontario, Western New York: District No. 4\\". Rand McNally Official Auto Trails Map, 3rd ed., 1924, pp. 168-169.

The road was legislated as part of several state routes in the 1910s and 1920s. Between Cape May and Seaville, the road was legislated as part of pre-1927 Route 14 in 1917. Pre-1927 Route 19 was designated to run along the current route between Seaville and Absecon, but was never built.State of New Jersey, Laws of 1923, Chapters 182-183. From Absecon north to Lakewood, and from South Amboy to Rahway, pre-1927 Route 4 was designated in 1916 along the current route. Between Lakewood and Freehold, pre-1927 Route 7 Spur, created in 1925, was to run on the present US 9 alignment.State of New Jersey, Laws of 1925, Chapters 24-25. Between Rahway and Elizabeth, pre-1927 Route 1 was created in 1916; an extension north to the Holland Tunnel was planned in 1922.State of New Jersey, Laws of 1922, Chapter 253. When the U.S. Highway System was created in 1926, US 9 was designated in New Jersey to run from US 30 in Absecon north to the New York border in Alpine, where it continued into New York as US 9W. In New Jersey, the route followed the entirety of pre-1927 Route 4 between Absecon and Rahway, bending farther to the east of its current alignment between Lakewood and South Amboy by running closer to the Atlantic Ocean. In Rahway, US 9 joined US 1 and pre-1927 Route 1 for a concurrency north toward Newark. Past Newark, the road followed current US 1/9 Truck toward Jersey City, where US 1 and US 9 split. At this point, US 9 continued north on its current alignment in Fort Lee, where it then ran north on present-day CR 501 toward the New York border. US 9 was designated along this alignment to the New York border as the original numbering plans called for it to continue up the west bank of the Hudson River to Albany, New York, with US 109 running along the east bank of the river. However, it was instead split into two suffixed routes in New York, with US 9W running along the west bank and US 9E running along the east bank, New Jersey had kept its alignment of US 9 to US 9W at the border in Alpine. In the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering, the present-day routing of US 9 between Cape May and Woodbridge became part of Route 4, while the portion along the US 1/9 concurrency south of the Tonnele Circle became part of Route 25 and north of there to the George Washington Bridge became Route 1 and Route 6. Meanwhile, what had been signed as US 9 at the time was Route 4 from Absecon to Lakewood, Route 35 between Lakewood and Belmar and Eatontown and South Amboy (now Route 88 between Lakewood and Point Pleasant), Route 4N (now Route 71) between Belmar and Eatontown, Route 4 (now Route 35) between South Amboy and Rahway, Route 27 between Rahway and Newark, Route 25 between Newark and Jersey City, and Route 1 north of Jersey City.State of New Jersey, Laws of 1927, Chapter 319. After the Pulaski Skyway opened in 1932, US 9, along with US 1 and Route 25, was routed onto it. By the 1940s, US 9 was extended south along Route 4 to Cape May, with the small southern piece leading to US 30 in Absecon becoming an unnumbered road that is now Route 157. In addition, US 9 was moved to its current routing between South Amboy and the George Washington Bridge. By 1947, US 9 and Route 4 were moved to a new alignment between Freehold and Old Bridge Township, with the old alignment becoming Route 4A (now Route 79 and a part of Route 34). US 9 southbound at exit for Route 34 in Old Bridge Township In the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering, the state highways running concurrent with US 9 were removed. In addition, US 1/9 Truck was created as a truck bypass of the Pulaski Skyway, replacing Route 25T, and US 1/9 Business (now Route 139) was signed along the former Route 25 approach to the Holland Tunnel. After the Garden State Parkway was completed through the Toms River area in 1954, US 9 was moved to it to bypass the center of the community and the former route became US 9 Alternate (now Route 166). Also in 1954, a new bridge for the Garden State Parkway was built over the Mullica River at the site of the US 9 bridge; the old bridge carrying US 9 was dismantled, and the route was designated to follow the Garden State Parkway over the Mullica River from two interchanges. The approaches to the former bridge became Route 167. In the mid-1960s, a limited-access toll road called the Garden State Thruway was planned along the US 9 alignment between Toms River and Woodbridge. This freeway was intended to serve all vehicles and provide a shortcut to the Garden State Parkway and US 9 through central New Jersey but was never built. In the early 1970s, another plan surfaced for a US 9 freeway from Route 34 in Madison Township (now Old Bridge Township) north to Route 35 in Sayreville. The freeway, which was to cost $17 million, was not built due to financial problems. A freeway was also proposed for US 9 in Atlantic County in the late 1960s, running from the proposed Route 60 freeway in Somers Point to CR 575 in Smithville. This freeway, which was to cost $35 million and intended to alleviate traffic on the current US 9 and the Garden State Parkway, was also never built due to financial and environmental issues. In 1972, US 9 was relocated from its southern terminus in Cape May to head west to its new southern terminus at the Cape May‚ÄìLewes Ferry terminal in North Cape May, with the former route into Cape May becoming Route 109. US 9 was extended across the ferry to US 13 in Laurel, Delaware in 1974. In 2001, a new span was added to the Edison Bridge over the Raritan River in a $60 million project. The Victory Circle at the north end of the Route 35 concurrency in Sayreville was replaced with an interchange between 2003 and 2006. The Beesley's Point Bridge over the Great Egg Harbor was closed to traffic in 2004 because of a crumbling deck, with the bridge owner, the Beesley‚Äôs Point Bridge Company, unable to fund repairs. US 9 was detoured around the closure on the Garden State Parkway. In 2008, Cape May County acquired the bridge from the Beesley‚Äôs Point Bridge Company and planned to restore it by 2012, with an estimated cost of $20 million. However, the Beesley's Point Bridge was slated to be demolished in 2013 as part of a project that will also replace the Great Egg Harbor Bridge. As of 2011, a $588 million project for expansion of the segment of US 9 between Toms River and Lakewood was in a \\"design concept\\" phase with funding earmarked for 2016-2017 construction. The segment of US 9 in New Jersey was mentioned in the Bruce Springsteen song \\"Born to Run\\" in the lines \\"Sprung from cages on Highway 9 / Chrome wheeled, fuel injected and steppin' out over the line.\\" ==Major intersectionsRelated routes== There is one remaining bannered spur of US 9 in the state of New Jersey: *U.S. Route 1-9 Truck in Jersey City The following state highways were also formerly designated as bannered spurs of US 9: *Route 139 in Jersey City was formerly U.S. Route 1-9 Business *Route 166 in Toms River was formerly U.S. Route 9 Alternate Additionally, the following state highways are former alignments of U.S. Route 9: *Route 109 in Cape May *Route 157 in Absecon *Route 167 near Bass River Township ==See also== * * ==ReferencesExternal links== *Speed Limits for Route 9 Category:Garden State Parkway Category:Limited-access roads in New Jersey Category:Transportation in Atlantic County, New Jersey Category:Transportation in Bergen County, New Jersey Category:Transportation in Burlington County, New Jersey Category:Transportation in Cape May County, New Jersey Category:Transportation in Essex County, New Jersey Category:Transportation in Hudson County, New Jersey Category:Transportation in Middlesex County, New Jersey Category:Transportation in Monmouth County, New Jersey Category:Transportation in Ocean County, New Jersey Category:Transportation in Union County, New Jersey Category:Transportation in the Pine Barrens (New Jersey) 09 ","title":"U.S. Route 9 in New Jersey"},{"id":"5601707","text":"The Fraternity (also known as The Circle) is a Canadian thriller film about a circle of friends that create an elite club while at the Runcie High School and cheat on an exam.

When the circle learns that Smitty was the rat, they decide to kidnap Smitty and force him to confess to the murder. Smitty does so, and confesses to having dressed up as a lady and having some type of sexual relationship with Runcie. Smitty killed Faulkner because he was convinced that Faulkner knew that he was the rat, and told Runcie about it after the fact. Runcie is wounded in a fight between him and Smitty, and the police arrive in time to arrest Smitty, and to take Runcie to the hospital.

Throughout his work he emphasized the significance of history. == Biography == Born September 11, 1917 in Vienna, Austria, Engelmann arrived in the United States in 1939, just two weeks before World War II broke out in Europe. Having fled first to Czechoslovakia and later to France as a result of the German annexation of Austria in 1938, he worked as a laborer in the fields of France until he was able to sail to America, as recorded in Journey Into a New Life.Engelmann, Hugo. 2002. Journey Into a New Life. Carmel, IN, Simudell Publishers. Following graduate school at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison he taught at Michigan State University in East Lansing, at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMilwaukee, and at Northern Illinois University, DeKalb. Towards the end of the 1950s he was among the first members of the Society for General Systems Research. He was the first editor of the Wisconsin Sociologist 1960-62, then again in 1965-70. In 1963 Engelmann was president of the Wisconsin Sociological Association. He appeared in Who‚Äôs Who in America in 1989.

In the 1960s Engelmann regularly participated in civil rights marches and was a strong advocate for racial and gender equality at a time when neither could be taken for granted even at universities. In the early 1970s one of his papers - an analysis of bussing and neighborhood schools‚Äîwas quoted in a successful desegregation suit of Milwaukee Public Schools initiated by Lloyd Barbee.Nelson, James K. 1998. \\"Milwaukee School Desegregation in the 1960s,\\" University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMilwaukee. From 1969 until he retired Professor Emeritus in 1989 he taught, wrote, and traveled throughout the US and Europe. Retirement did not change much. He continued his active correspondence with colleagues and former students for 30 years and more. He remained active in sociology until his death on February 2, 2002 in DeKalb, Illinois. His wife Ruth is author of Leaf House: Days of Remembering. Their son John is a lawyer and is sometimes a co- author of Engelmann's articles. == Work == For most of his life he was first and foremost a sociologist. Ethnicity and religion were distant runners up. He was a strong supporter of intellectual freedom, equal rights, civil liberties, and workers. That spirit is evident in the first Wisconsin Sociologist journal‚Äîtoday called Sociological Imagination. It insisted it was \\"a journal of communication, published cooperatively by its contributors, under the auspices of WSA Wisconsin Sociological Association. Communications may cover any subject matter of concern to social scientists in their respective roles as scientific workers, teachers, and professional employees.\\"Elder, Joann F. 2000. \\"The Wisconsin Sociological Association A Brief History,‚Äù University of Wisconsin. About injustice he had this to say, \\"...when we restrict the behavioral development of others, we are depriving ourselves of interactive opportunities, and limit our own development. Thus, we can say in a very real sense that 'Whatsoever we shall do unto the least of them, we shall have done to ourselves.'\\"Engelmann, Hugo O. 2001. \\"Letters to the Editor. Science under siege,\\" submitted for publication Skeptical Inquirer, dated. October 11., 2001.  Population Expansion and the Social System  Through billions of small-scale social interactions society changes in piecemeal ways and often in contradictory directions. Still, the overall thrust of social change can be discerned. In his 1967 paper \\"Population Expansion and the Social System,\\"Engelmann, Hugo O. 1970. \\"Population Expansion and the Social System,\\" Indian Sociological Bulletin. pp. 21-38. Engelmann outlined his basic theory. As the world's population increases people interact with each other more and more frequently due to crowding, migration, and travel. Freedom declines, power exercise at first increases but later abates (see also Engelmann and Cash, 1981),Engelmann, Hugo O. and A. E. Cash. 1981. \\"The decline of power exercise at high interaction frequency levels,\\" International Journal of Contemporary Sociology. 8. Engelmann, Hugo O. 1985. ‚ÄûOrwell, modern thought, and totalitarianism,‚Äù Quarterly Journal of Ideology. Vol. 9, No. 2: 17-31.) and violence becomes boundless. Beyond a certain point totalitarian power structures eclipse authoritarian ones. Sheer amounts of interaction transform vertical power structures into horizontal ones as more and more people exercise power over each other. In \\"Orwell, Modern Thought, and Totalitarianism\\" Engelmann drew a stark distinction between authoritarian and totalitarian societies. \\"Authoritarian police officials aiming at outward compliance suppress activities considered undesirable. Totalitarian leaders look for inner conviction expressed in positive enthusiasm or contrite confession.\\"  Other 1960s papers  In his paper \\"A Sociohistorical Perspective for East European Developments\\"Engelmann, Hugo O. 1991. \\"A sociohistorical perspective for East European developments,\\" Journal of Political and Military Sociology. Vol. 19 (Winter) 217-231. he made his point even more forcefully, \\"While totalitarianism derives from psychological rigidity, authoritarian rule depends on external enforcement of regulations through power exercise.\\" His anthropological views were laid out in \\"The Activity Bias of Ethnography and the History of Society\\" (1960).Engelmann, Hugo O. 1960. \\"The Activity Bias of Ethnography and the History of Society,\\" Anthropological Quarterly. Vol. 33. No. 3, July:158-163. Researchers are prone to focus on the physical manifestations of people's activity, such as pottery, tools, or weapons, but ignore their experiential patterns. As technology becomes more and more developed researchers all too often conclude that society is increasing in complexity. They ignore the possibility that activity expands at expense to experiential intricacy. Engelmann's historical perspective was especially evident in \\"The European Empire: From Charlemagne to the Common Market\\" (1962).Engelmann, Hugo O. 1962. \\"The European Empire: From Charlemagne to the Common Market,\\" Social Forces. Vol 40, No. 4. May: 297-301. The geographic similarity between Charlemagne's Empire and that of the Common Market almost twelve-hundred years later was attributed to similar phases of migration patterns. Like the outward expansion of Charlemagne's forces, a similar pattern was noticed in the Common Market. Even Charlemagne's capital, Aachen, is a mere 75 miles from NATO headquarters in Brussels. Matthew Omolesky, in his 2009 article about the European Union, \\"Between Rome and Byzantium,\\" cites Engelmann's observation about the geographic similarity between the Common Market and Charlemagne's Empire too. A recurring theme in Engelmann's work refers to professional manipulators engaging others in activity for its own sake regardless of its nature or consequences. In his last paper, \\"Science under Siege\\",Engelmann, Hugo O. 2001. Letters to the Editor. \\"Science is under siege,\\" Skeptical Inquirer, dated. October 11. he warned of two sorts of religion edging their way into science. The first is the supernaturalist view, the sort of view held by Creationists. The second is more subtle. It is the naturalist view. Advocates of either notion urge us to believe things that cannot be put to the test. Whether God created the heavens and the earth in six days or whether there are parallel universes have nothing whatsoever to do with science no matter how gladly true believers would have it so. Central to all science is the testable hypothesis. If it is not there, we are not talking about science.  Sociology of knowledge  Great theories generate numerous testable hypotheses. Engelmann's theory was very successful in that regard. His hypotheses were on target whether about aggression, random violence, cultural closure, anti-intellectualism, diminishing freedoms, or scientific viewpoints. In the late 1960s when riots were common place and everyone blamed everyone else, Engelmann sought answers to questions no one else was asking. Statistically speaking, how do groups emerge? In terms of probability how can they persist? The questions involve two mathematical curves. One represents the likelihood that a subgroup of a specific size will emerge; the other is the probability that it will persist. The product of the two curves provided the answer for the one-third hypothesis in 1967.Engelmann, Hugo O. 1967. \\"Communication to the Editor. [A curious mathematical property],\\" American Sociologist. Vol. 2 Number 4: 217 Those groups most likely to emerge and to persist are the ones that amount to one- third of the total population, whether they be ethnic enclaves in the city,Youngquist, Wayne A. 1968. \\"Wooden shoes and the one-third hypothesis.\\" Wisconsin Sociologist. Vol. 6; Spring-Summer 1968; # 1 & 2. students protesting in the streets, social movements coming to the fore, or local governments on the rise. Most intriguing was Engelmann's concept central to almost all his hypotheses. Both the intensity and complexity of an average individual's behavior cannot increase simultaneously. As one goes up the other goes down. Twenty-three centuries after Aristotle we find an explanation for his assertion, \\"If we take intense delight in one thing, we cannot do anything else at all.\\" Aristotle. Nicomachean Ethics. Book 10, Chapter 5, James. E. C. Welldon translation. We also find that behavioral intensity increases with rising interaction frequency even as complexity declines. Therein lies the source of both power exercise and the widespread approval of it in modern times. Engelmann's sociology of knowledge carefully distinguished between total relativisim and intellectually adequate work. In other words, ‚Äú‚Ä¶ideas limited by one‚Äôs own social position will be biased‚Ä¶Engelmann argued that scientific observations (and laws) are societally invariate--true across the entire society.‚Äù Mica, J. Hunter. 2006. Assistant Director of Admission for Research and Information, Ithaca College, Ithaca, New York. In Engelmann's office hung two photos, one of Albert Einstein, the other of Martin Luther King, Jr. Each in his own way underscored the fact that society is a network of direct and indirect interactions. Their views on society, which were very similar to those of Engelmann, became many years later the source of an article by one of his former students called \\"The Preacher and the Physicist.\\" Johnson, Warren R. 2001. ‚ÄúThe Preacher and the Physicist.‚Äù UMUC Social Sciences Newsletter, Term II 2001-2002, pp. 7-8. == See also == * Interaction frequency * One-third hypothesis == Publications == Engelmann wrote six books and at least fifty articles, a selection: * 1953.

It is named for the 23rd United States President, Benjamin Harrison. ==History== Land was purchased in 1903, with the post being officially named for President Harrison in honor of Indianapolis being his hometown. In 1901, Harrison's son Russell, through lobbying efforts, facilitated the sale a nearby U.S. Arsenal, and the U.S. Army used the proceeds to buy land where the fort is located today. Fort Benjamin Harrison saw its highest level of activity during World War I and World War II. The Fort Benjamin Harrison Reception Center opened in 1941 and was the largest reception center in the United States by 1943. Within Fort Harrison was Camp Glenn, named in honor of Major General Edwin Forbes Glenn, who had served as Fort Harrison's commandant from 1912 to 1913,Bower, 79 and who had commanded the officer training that began at his camps in 1916.Bower, 20-21 Camp Glenn was a Citizens Military Training Camp (CMTC) that was also used to house Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) workers.Fort Benjamin Harrison State Park brochure: Today, several of the buildings and tent sites exist as part of the Fort Harrison State Park nature center. When the United States reestablished the Military Police Corps in 1941, an MP school was established at Camp Glenn and was in operation by early 1942. The area was also used to detain Italian and German prisoners of war in 1944 and 1945. In 1947, the Army declared Fort Harrison to be surplus property,Bower, 187 but declined to completely close it due to a lack of adequate training space for the Indiana National Guard.Bower, 189 From 1948 to 1950, the post functioned as Benjamin Harrison Air Force Base.

It became the home of the United States Army Adjutant General School in March 1951. In 1957, the school moved into the new Gates-Lord Hall along with the United States Army Finance School. At the time, this building was the third largest owned by the Department of Defense. The Adjutant General School would remain there until the Base Realignment resulted in its move to Fort Jackson, South Carolina, starting in 1991. By 1995, the Adjutant General School had completely vacated Fort Benjamin Harrison.Stephen E. Bower, Ph.D., A Short History of the U.S. Army Adjutant General‚Äôs Corps 1775-2013, Fort Jackson SC, US Army Soldier Support Institute, 2013 The Finance School also moved to Fort Jackson in 1995. The Interservice Postal School was located at Fort Benjamin Harrison in the 1970s under the US Army Institute of Administration (USAIA), and was staffed by instructors from all four services. It also moved to Fort Jackson in 1995. Beginning in 1965, Fort Harrison was also the home of the Defense Information School (DINFOS). This was staffed by enlisted personnel and officers from all branches of the US military along with members of allied military personnel. DINFOS trained service members and Department of Defense employees to become journalists in print, radio, television, and photography, as well as training them in advanced supervisory roles in editing, public affairs, and media and community relations. In 1995, DINFOS moved to Fort Meade, Maryland. With the movement and creation of a number of training classes in financial, clerical, and information technology (most notably the Programmer/Analyst Course and the Computer Machine Operator Course) the fort was given the derisive moniker \\"Uncle Ben's Rest Home\\" implying that no real military training took place there. The Fort was the site of the Athletes' Villages for the 1987 Pan American Games. Construction documents were created for new buildings to house the athletes, but the buildings were not built. Remaining Military Presence Fort Benjamin Harrison was closed as part of the 1991 Base Realignment and Closure Commission. The site of the base has since been redeveloped, and includes residential neighborhoods, a golf course, and is the site of Fort Harrison State Park. Although the base has officially been inactivated, there is still a very significant military presence in the area. The Defense Finance and Accounting Service‚ÄîIndianapolis, several United States Army Reserve, Indiana National Guard units, the United States Military Entrance Processing Station (MEPS), and a post exchange and commissary are still located at the former post.Fort Harrison Reuse Authority - History ; accessed 28 November 2009.

H. (1953). A Treasury of New Zealand Fish. Wellington: Hutcheson, Bowman and Stewart Ltd. As it grows out of this larval stage entering the juvenile stage one eye moves to the right side leaving the other blind and it takes on a flat diamond shape swimming flat/parallel to the ground. On the right side, the fish is a greenish brown dark colour or grey with faint mottling and on the left side (the side it lies on without eyes) it is white.Paul, L. (1986). New Zealand Fishes. Auckland: Reed Books. The average length of an adult sand flounder is 25‚Äì35 cm with the maximum being 45 cm.Paul, L. (1997). Marine Fishes of New Zealand. Auckland: Reed Books. In the day time, they lie on the seabed camouflaged almost perfectly in sand or mud; they have special pigment cells on their skin that can change colour to match their background, their protruding blue-green eyes being their only giveaway.Doak, W. (2003). Sea Fishes of New Zealand. (B. O'Flaherty, Ed.) New Holland Publishers Ltd. They swim in a flowing style with an undulating movement of the side fins and when threatened by predators their tail is used for propulsion. Technically the adult swims on its side with the continuous dorsal fin fringing one edge of its diamond shaped body and its extended anal fin on the other. It has no swim bladder and only leaves the seabed for courtship and spawning activities.Paul, L., & Moreland, J. (1993). Handbook of New Zealand Marine Fishes. Auckland: Reed Books. == Distribution ==  Natural global range  Sand flounder are native to New Zealand so they are not found anywhere else in the world but they are found all over New Zealand.Munroe T.A. (2010)  Rhombosolea plebeia. The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species 2010  New Zealand range  New Zealand sand flounder is found in a majority of coastal waters around New Zealand. Its largest population is found at Tasman Bay and on the East Coast of the South Island. Around New Zealand they can be found in harbours, inlets, bays and open water.Munroe T.A. (2010)  Rhombosolea plebeia. The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species 2010  Habitat preferences  They prefer coastal areas and are found in waters up to 50m deep but rarely deeper. They can be found in harbours, inlets, bays and open water. They are common on mudflats but seem to have no preference of bottom substrate as they are also found on sand, clay, pebbles and gravel bottoms.Munroe T.A. (2010)  Rhombosolea plebeia. The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species 2010 They also can be found in estuaries.McDowall R.M. (1976) The Role of Estuaries in the Life Cycles of Fishes in New Zealand. New Zealand Ecological Society 26. When they are juveniles they are found in sheltered inshore areas such as estuaries, mudflats and sand flats where they will stay for around two years. They also prefer a temperate climate.Torres A. Rhombosolea plebeia summary page ==Life cycle== The geographic location of the New Zealand sand flounder determines its spawning period. In the north, it has a long spawning period from March to December. In the south, spawning largely occurs in the spring. A study in the Hauraki Gulf found sand flounder lay between 100,000 and 500,000 eggs when spawning. The variation in the number of eggs laid was attributed to the difference in size of the female laying the eggs. After a period of time dependent on the temperature of the water (usually around a week), the larval sand flounder hatches. Larval sand flounders have a large yolk sac attached to their underside, providing nutrients to the fish until it is large enough to feed itself. At this stage, they are less than a half a centimetre in length. They have an eye on each side of their head and swim upright, as most fish do. As sand flounders grow they begin utilising external food sources such as seaweed spores and algae, and as they grow further, small shrimp and plankton. The extra nutrients they receive from these new food sources enables them to grow to around one and a half centimetres by the time they are three weeks old. Above each eye of the sand flounder is a bar of cartilage, and at this stage of its development the cartilage above the left eye is absorbed and the eye begins to move from the side of the head, until it is next to the right eye. The unusual, twisted shape of the mouth of the sand flounder is due to the movement of the skull and bones as the left eye migrates to the right side of the body. While this slow process is occurring, the sand flounder begins to grow out to the side and flatten, losing its rounded shape. This metamorphism makes swimming as the larval sand flounder was able to difficult and exhausting. The now juvenile sand flounders sink to the bottom and begin swimming as adult flatfish do, by undulating their side fins and for rapid acceleration, use their tail. The juvenile R. plebeia migrate to the shallow water of the estuaries and mudflats where they remain until they mature at two years old. Once R. plebeia reach a mature age and size, they migrate to deeper water of around 30 to 50 metres deep to spawn. After this first migration, they continue to migrate from shallow waters (0-50m) in spring and summer to deeper waters (50-100m) in autumn and winter. Male R. plebeia are smaller than female R. plebeia, maturing at a length of 10 cm, but can grow to 15‚Äì17 cm. The females grow faster, with mature size being 16‚Äì20 cm long, but they grow to 23‚Äì24 cm by age two. By age of three, female sand flounders grow to an average size of 30 cm. The average life span of flounder is three to four years. This equates to being able to have two years of spawning. ==Diet and foraging== The sand flounder feeds off a yolk-sac attached to its under surface until they are capable of fending for themselves. As an adult it is adapted to feed best at night on sand or mud. They are ambush predators, going unnoticed by camouflage and then attacking their prey when it comes near. They eat a variety of bottom-dwelling invertebrates such as crabs, brittlestars, shrimps, worms, whitebait, shellfish and tiny fishes located by touch and vision.Paul, L. (1997). Marine Fishes of New Zealand. Auckland: Reed Books. They also ingest mud detritus and seaweed while feeding.Graham, D. H. (1953). A Treasury of New Zealand Fish. Wellington: Hutcheson, Bowman and Stewart Ltd. ==Predators, parasites, and diseases== Sand flounder are a very important commercial fish in New Zealand which means that humans are a predominant predator for them.Munroe T.A. (2010)  Rhombosolea plebeia. The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species 2010 Flat fishes including the sand flounder are good at camouflage which allows them to hide well from any predators. They are good at it because when they settle they wiggle their marginal fins throwing up a shower of sand or mud which lands on them and makes them almost undetectable.Manikiam J.S. Manikiam (1969) A Guide to Flatfishes (Order Heterosomata) of New Zealand Tuatara In saying this sand flounders still get preyed on, some predators include tope, spined dogfish, Maori chief, ling and toadfish.D.H. Graham (1939) Food of the Fishes of Otago Harbour and Adjacent Sea Royal Society of New Zealand In a study done in the Avon-Heathcote Estuary they found that sand flounder were hosts of many different parasites including Nerocila orbignyi and Heteracanthocephalus peltorhamphi which were both found in less than one percent of fish sampled. They found trematode's in 24% of the sand flounder, Hedruris spinigera in 6%, and fungal patches on 13%.Webb B.F. Webb (1973) Fish populations of the Avon‚ÄêHeathcote Estuary (Breeding and Gonad Maturity) New Zealand Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research ==Other== The New Zealand sand flounder is a popular fish caught by humans to eat. Recreational fishers catch the fish usually in beach seines, setnets or with spears.Paul, L. (1997). Marine Fishes of New Zealand. Auckland: Reed Books. The Maori used wooden spears to catch what they called ‚ÄòPatiki‚Äô at night on mud flats. They would attract the ‚ÄòPatiki‚Äô by light from a torch made of pine, spearing them with ease.Graham, D. H. (1953). A Treasury of New Zealand Fish. Wellington: Hutcheson, Bowman and Stewart Ltd. Commercially sand flounder are fished by trawl and setnet.Paul, L. (1997). Marine Fishes of New Zealand. Auckland: Reed Books. Sand flounder is very easy to cook and there are many ways to cook and serve it depending on preferences. At its simplest, it can be served beautifully after washing, drenching in flour and frying each side in a medium hot pan with oil/butter until the skin is crisp.Enderby, J., & Enderby, T. (2012). Know Your New Zealand Fishes. (B. O'Flaherty, Ed.) New Holland Publishers Ltd. At the moment, sand flounder numbers are decreasing, but there is no evidence to show that the decline is rapid and they are still common in areas where they are found. So, because of this, they have been classed as Least Concern on the red list category and criteria. For these reasons, there is no current conservation effort to try save sand flounder, but as it is one of the most important commercial fishes in New Zealand ongoing research on the harvest levels and population numbers of this species is needed to make sure that they do not leave the Least Concern class and so that they know if they do, conservation efforts can be made.Munroe T.A.

A prolific writer, Ballantine contributed circus and travel essays to major magazines. His many stories of circus life appeared in Collier's, Holiday, Harper‚Äôs Bazaar, Saturday Evening Post, True, Saga, and Seventeen. Ballantine also authored ten books, including Wild Tigers and Tame Fleas, Horses and Their Bosses, and Clown Alley, which chronicles his years as dean of the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Clown College. Over his long career as a writer/illustrator, he published nearly 100 articles on circus and travel and regularly illustrated True magazine's backpage feature ‚ÄúStrange but True‚Äù with his graceful and warmly humorous pen- and-ink line drawings. ==Life== Born in 1910 in Millvale, Pennsylvania, Ballantine was introduced to circuses by his father, a member of the Mystic Shrine and once mayor of their home town. Mixing sawdust and grease paint with the sparkling tarnish of the music hall next door to his childhood home, Ballantine developed a lifelong hunger for show business. After graduating from high school, Ballantine found work in a sign shop, painting posters for local movie houses, and after several years, began attending the Art Institute of Pittsburgh, beginning his long career as an artist/illustrator and later writer. Through the years, he worked for a succession of employers, including the Pittsburgh Sun-Telegraph, Associated Press, PM, Punch and during World War II, the Office of War Information for which he designed and drew pro-democracy leaflets that the U.S. government air-dropped over the European continent. Ballantine also accepted freelance illustration and writing assignments that often provided him the opportunity to hitch rides with circus caravans. He traveled with Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus during the 1946 season and then, finally, in 1947, he decided to bid a temporary farewell to the workaday world of publishing and run away to the circus. He ‚Äújoined out‚Äù as a clown with the biggest of all big tops, Ringling Bros. and Barnum Bailey Circus. It was his great fortune to become a member of the Ringling clown alley with the august of the augustes‚ÄîFelix Adler, Paul Jerome, Paul Jung, Emmett Kelly, and Harry Dann‚Äîas his working colleagues. While working as a clown, he met his wife, Roberta Ballantine, a graduate of Pomona College who left California immediately after receiving her BA to go to NY where she worked as an actress and comedian before being hired by RBBB as the slender ‚ÄúSnow Queen‚Äù who rode about the tent in the payoff float, a horse-drawn carriage with Prince Paul, the midget king. In her silver spangled skin-tight costume with her ostrich plume headdress, she looked ‚Äúnine feet tall‚Äù to Bill who walked behind the float dressed as a sailor carrying a buxom mermaid: From the waist up, he was mermaid, his clown face framed by long blond curls and a golden crown topped by a single pink feather. A double strand of three-inch (76 mm) fake pearls hung down over pearl-studded breasts. Rings and bracelets slipped over his elbow length white cotton gloves, and in one hand, he carried a gold-filigree hand mirror. From the waist down he was sailor with white cotton duck pants reaching to red striped socks and oversized clown shoes. Strapped to his front was the false fish tail of the mermaid and strapped to his back the false upper half of the sailor. As a final touch, the false arms of the sailor‚Äôs torso draped around his own waist, and there he was, a sailor carrying a mermaid. After Bill and Roberta married in 1948, they both left the life of sawdust and spangles, but Bill soon returned, first to design a complete new midway for the show, including sideshow banners and menagerie cage designs, and then as a chronicler of the backlot and the show. In 1994, 64 of his large circus drawings were exhibited at the John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art Circus Gallery in Sarasota, Florida, where Bill and Roberta settled after raising a family of five children in Rockland County, New York. Clown college From 1969 through 1977, Ballantine served as dean of the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Clown College, a school that offered the secrets of humor and comedy, and demanded much from its students, yet gave even more. A former student, NPR‚Äôs Murray Horwitz, noted in 1999 after Ballantine‚Äôs death, ‚ÄúI remember a time 30 years ago when American circus clowning had fallen on hard times and Bill Ballantine came to the rescue. Dozens of his students worked on the Ringling show, but hundreds more took their skills to the theatre, to mud shows and to the streets. Among them were Penn Jillette of Penn & Teller, The incredible Bill Irwin, and the actor, David Strathairn.‚ÄùHorwitz, Murray. \\"Ballantine obituary.\\" NPR: All Things Considered (May 19, 1999). ==Death== Bill Ballantine died of Alzheimer's disease on May 14, 1999. His wife (now deceased), the writer Roberta Ballantine, fifteen grandchildren, and five children survived him. His eldest son, Toby followed in his father's footsteps and came to be recognized as a well-known clown and performer of magic. His eldest daughter, Bridget, once sparkled above the ring on a single trapeze. She is now retired. Bill Ballantine will always be remembered by artists and circus folk alike as Murray Horwitz described him in 1999: a man who ‚Äúproved that it was OK to put real ideas into your comedy‚Äù and ‚Äúshowed you that there were different kinds of intelligence and that acrobats and wire walkers could be just as witty in their way as poets.‚Äù == Bibliography == * The Man in the Manhole and the Fix- it Men.

Jackie Speier, a Democrat, has represented the district since January 2013. Currently, it contains most of San Mateo County and a sliver of southwestern San Francisco. Cities in the district include Belmont, Brisbane, Burlingame, Colma, Daly City, East Palo Alto, El Granada, Foster City, Half Moon Bay, Hillsborough, Millbrae, Montara, Moss Beach, Pacifica, San Bruno, San Carlos, San Mateo, South San Francisco, and part of Redwood City. From 1993 to 2013, the 14th district lay farther south, comprising portions of San Mateo, Santa Clara, and Santa Cruz counties. Cities in the district included Mountain View, Sunnyvale, Menlo Park, Palo Alto, Half Moon Bay, and Scotts Valley. According to a 2006 report, the district was the third wealthiest in the nation. Since redistricting by the California Citizens Redistricting Commission of 2011, most of that district is now the 18th District, while the current 14th covers most of what was the 12th District. ==History==  Recent election results from statewide races { class= - bgcolor=\\"#EEEEEE\\" align=\\"center\\" !

Together they had four children, a son, Marcus Junius Silanus, and three daughters, Junia Prima, Junia Secunda, and Junia Tertia. Tertia was rumoured to be the daughter of Julius Caesar, who had been Servilia's lover. Political career He was aedile in 70 BC, but he lost the election to be a consul of 63. He was successful the following year, and so in consequence of his being consul designatus was first asked for his opinion by Cicero in the debate in the senate on the punishment of the Catilinarian conspirators. At first he spoke in favor of \\"the supreme penalty\\" for the conspirators, but when Julius Caesar suggested life imprisonment, Silanus insisted that was what he had really meant. As such, it was left to Cato the Younger to force through the decision to actually execute them. He was consul in 62 with Lucius Licinius Murena. They proposed the lex Junia Licinia, which provided that a rogatio (a proposed law) must be promulgated three nundinae, or market-intervals, before the people voted on it.

Concentration Camps On 26 April 1945, concentrated fire from small arms and automatic weapons pinned down K Company of Major General Stanley Eric Reinhart's 260th Infantry Regiment as it entered Plattling. First Lieutenant David Ewing Ott from 868th Field Artillery Battalion, a future Lieutenant General, served as attached forward artillery observer. Because of his exceedingly precise fire direction, three small bursts silenced the enemy. Under hostile observation, Ott preceded the most forward elements by 1,000 yards to direct artillery fire from a high ridge. It resulted in 150 enemy casualties, and the surrender of a German infantry platoon.

AUTO CHINON 28MM Chinon CE-3 memotron labeled as Revueflex AC 1 Chinon CP-9 AF with Autofocus lens 35-135mm They manufactured many cameras, such as the CG-5, which was one of the first cameras ever to use an Auto Focus lens, which had to be bought separately. The lenses are now rare. They were cumbersome and had two infra- red \\"eyes\\" on the top. They would connect by a bayonet fitting similar to the Pentax K fitting, except they also had electrical contacts which would power the motor at the press of the shutter release button. Another popular camera was the CM-1, a basic, fully manual 35 mm SLR camera favored by student amateur photographers because it was cheaper than the rival Pentax K-1000, but could use the same lenses and accessories. The CM-1 featured a battery-powered through-the-lens light metering system that utilized a red-above, green- middle, and red-below to indicate whether the shutter speed/aperture setting was over/ok/under exposing the picture. It also used a split-image prism for determining when an image was properly focused. The CM-1 was sold through discount retailers such as K-Mart during the 1980s and proved to be very durable and reliable. Chinon branded products were sold in the UK through the Dixons high-street chain in the same period. Most of Chinon's SLR cameras used the Pentax K-mount, which was promoted by Pentax as a universal mount and therefore Pentax allowed and even encouraged other manufacturers to utilize their mount. This helped to expand the range of lens offerings for both Chinon and Pentax cameras. Several Chinon SLRs used the Pentax 42mm screw mount for the lens. Examples being the Chinon CS and the wonderful Memotron which were sold through Dixons. The CS had TTL metering and the Memotron had auto exposure with a handy system which allowed the user to take and retain a meter reading and save the exposure for a shot taken where the subject matter had been reframed. Very handy for against the light shots etc. Chinon also was a manufacturer of CD-ROM drives, scanners, electronic pocket calculators, and floppy disk drives.

Formerly a member of the genus Ptiloris, it has since been moved to the genus Lophorina alongside other riflebird species. It is found in subtropical, temperate rainforests in eastern Australia. The species is sexually dimorphic; the male is black with iridescent blue-green patches, while the female is gray-brown and white. The paradise riflebird is frugivorous and insectivorous. During breeding season, males are promiscuous and perform solitary displays for females, which involves moving rapidly from side to side with the head tilted back, showing off the neck plumage. ==Taxonomy== The paradise riflebird was initially described as Ptiloris paradiseus by William Swainson in 1825. It was one of the four riflebird species that was part of the now-defunct genus Ptiloris. More recently, after new genetic analysis, these riflebirds have been added to the genus Lophorina alongside the superb birds of paradise. The name Lophorina comes from a combination of the Greek words lophos, meaning ‚Äúcrest‚Äù or ‚Äútuft‚Äù, and rhinos, meaning ‚Äúnose‚Äù. This tuft nose refers to tufts on the noses of superb birds of paradise, which is absent on the riflebirds. The common name \\"riflebird\\" comes from the likeness of their black velvety plumage to the uniform of the British Army Rifle Brigade. There are currently no known subspecies of the paradise riflebird. It is similar in appearance to the other riflebird species, with males having similar iridescent blue-green patches and females appearing gray- brown with barred-patterned underparts. ==Description== The paradise riflebird is a medium-sized bird, with males averaging about 30 cm (11.8 in) in height and weighing on average 134 to 155 g (4.7 to 5.5 oz). Females are slightly smaller, averaging at 29 cm (11.4 in) and weighing on average 86 to 112 g (3.0 to 3.9 oz). Both genders have a long, black, decurved bill, black legs, and dark brown iris. The species is sexually dimorphic, with few similarities in plumage between males and females. The adult male is black with an iridescent greenish blue crown, throat, and central tail feathers, as well as iridescent green on the lower breast and flank. The central tail feathers are shortened, giving an appearance of blue over black along the tail. It has been suggested that some of the male's feathers are super black feathers. These feathers have been modified so that their barbules structurally absorb light, unlike normal black feathers, which emphasizes a darker appearance. These specialized feathers are found adjacent to brightly colored patches, suggesting that they help create optical illusions during courtship displays by exaggerating the bright colors they are juxtaposed to. The adult female is gray-brown, with rufous coloration on the primary and secondary wing feathers, save for a white streak on the supercilium, white throat, and lighter brown with a barred pattern running down the breast, flanks, and belly. Compared to the male, the adult female has a notably longer, more decurved bill. There has been little record of juvenile appearance. Juveniles of both genders resemble the adult female, with gray-brown feathers. Like the Victoria's riflebird and the growling riflebird, the paradise riflebird has a growling voice. The male is known for its powerful ‚Äúyaassss‚Äù call, often repeated once at a time and lasting around 2 seconds. thumb Adult Female Paradise Riflebird in Queensland, Australia Paradise Riflebird pauses for a brief moment while searching for insects ==Distribution and habitat== The paradise riflebird is endemic to eastern Australia, from New South Wales to Queensland, where it inhabits rainforests. It resides in the rainforest canopy, above 500 m (1640 ft) in elevation, though has been known to move to lower elevations, sometimes below 200 m (656 ft), in winter. It is primarily a sedentary species with a low population density. However, it has been known to migrate locally, moving from wet rainforests to nearby sclerophyll forests. == Ecology and behavior == The paradise riflebird mainly feeds on insects and fruit, high in the forest canopy. Occasionally, individuals may form foraging aggregations of 6-7 birds. Normally, however, it is a solitary, dispersed, non-territorial bird. Breeding occurs from August to February, during the spring to summer months in Australia. Like other birds of paradise, the paradise riflebird is promiscuous and polyginous. The male paradise riflebird performs a solitary display to females from perches of low-hanging, exposed canopy. Although individuals of the species are generally non-territorial, males are presumed to display territorial behavior over these perches during the mating season. The courtship display is composed of rapid side-to-side movements of the wings, which are held horizontally similar to other riflebirds, and head, with a gaping mouth and the iridescent blue-green sheen on the throat exposed. It is also suggested that males have super black feathers which help to create an optical illusion during courtship that emphasizes the iridescent patches they are adjacent to. The female paradise riflebird raises offspring alone. Paradise riflebird nests are comparable to Victoria's riflebird nests in shape, but are larger and bulkier. Clutch size, on average, is 2 eggs. ==Status and relationship to humans== The paradise riflebird has been hunted by humans for its plumage. It is highly vulnerable to deforestation and rainforest fragmentation due to its sedentary lifestyle and low population density, and has lost much of its original habitat. Currently, it is listed as a species of Least Concern, though its numbers are declining. ==Gallery== File:ParadiseRiflebird.jpgFemale in Laminington National Park File:Paradisaeidae - Ptiloris paradiseus.JPGPtiloris paradiseus.

The 4:3 aspect ratio became the standard in film because it mirrored film stock and was the easiest to use.Studiobinder. The Definitive Guide to Aspect Ratio (2019-08-05). Accessed 2020-03-08 Widescreen ratios started to become more popular in the 1990s and 2000s. Film originally created in the 4:3 aspect ratio does not need to be altered for full screen release, while other aspect ratios can be converted to full screen using techniques such as pan and scan, open matte or reframing. In pan and scan, the 4:3 image is extracted from within the original frame by cropping the sides of the film. In open matte, the 4:3 image is extracted from parts of the original negative which were shot but not intended to be used for the theatrical release. In reframing, elements within the image are repositioned. Reframing is almost exclusively a method used for entirely CG movies, where the elements can be easily moved. ==History== Full screen aspect ratios in standard television have been in use since the invention of moving picture cameras. Early computer monitors employed the same aspect ratio. The aspect ratio 4:3 was used for 35 mm films in the silent era. It is also very close to the 1.375:1 Academy ratio, defined by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences as a standard after the advent of optical sound-on-film. By having TV match this aspect ratio, movies originally photographed on 35 mm film could be satisfactorily viewed on TV in the early days of television (i.e. the 1940s and '50s). When cinema attendance dropped, Hollywood created widescreen aspect ratios (such as the 1.85:1 ratio mentioned earlier) in order to differentiate the film industry from TV. However, since the start of the 21st century, broadcasters worldwide began phasing out the 4:3 standard entirely as manufacturers started to favor the 16:9/16:10 aspect ratio of all modern high-definition television sets, broadcast cameras and computer monitors. ==See also== * Aspect ratio (image) ==References== Category:Film and video technology ","title":"Fullscreen (aspect ratio)"},{"id":"5601992","text":"The Vieilles Charrues Festival (, ; , ; literally: Old Ploughs Festival) is held every year in mid-July in the city of Carhaix located in the west of Brittany, France. This festival is the largest music festival in France, attracting more than 200,000 festival-goers every year (270,000 in 2011, 280,000 in 2017). This festival was created in 1992 in Landeleau, a small village in central Finist√®re. At that time, less than 500 revellers attended and the festival was more like a private party. The following year, the festival welcomed more than 2000 and that was the beginning of its success story. In 1995, due to lack of space on the original site, the festival moved to Carhaix city center and in 1998, for the same reason, the festival chose a site on the outskirts of Carhaix. In October 2016 the festival organizes an exceptional concert at Central Park in New York City in tribute to the many Bretons who were immigrants to the city in the nineteenth century. Each year, more than 5,500 volunteers enable the festival to be a success, with their actions in the numerous bars, restaurants, and other stands of the festival. The festival thanks them by giving money to local associations. The organizers also helped to finance Hall Glenmor, a concert hall, and to renovate the Ch√¢teau de Kerampuil, a castle located near the site of the festival.

It is chiefly known for its cultivation of white asparagus (Beelitzer Spargel). ==Geography== Beelitz is situated about 18 km (11 mi) south of Potsdam, on the rim of the Zauche glacial sandur plain. The town is surrounded by extended pine woods of the Nuthe-Nieplitz Nature Park. Located on an old trade route from Berlin to Leipzig, today the Bundesstra√üe 2, it also has access to the Bundesautobahn 9 at the Beelitz-Heilst√§tten and Beelitz junctions. Train service to Potsdam and Berlin via the Berlin-Blankenheim railway line is available at Beelitz Stadt and Beelitz-Heilst√§tten stations. ==History== A 997 deed by Emperor Otto III mentions a settlement with the Slavic name Belizi, though this denotation may also refer to the nearby town of Belzig. Saints Mary and Nicholas The Saint Mary and Saint Nicholas parish church was first mentioned in a 1247 report of a Jewish host desecration, and bleeding host miracle, that made Beelitz a medieval pilgrimage site. Since 1370 the host was kept in a small chapel adjacent to the church.Das Wunderblut von Beelitz p12 Dieter Hoffmann-Axthelm - 2009 \\"... ab dem ein solches Wunder m√∂glich war und f√ºr Beelitz wahrscheinlich zu machen ist.

The cultivation of asparagus was first documented in 1861. The village of Kanin, a subdivision of Beelitz since 2001, had been an exclave of the Electorate of Saxony until 1815 and therefore a notorious smuggling area as well as a destination for deserters from the Prussian army. Its fieldstone church was erected about 1138 and today is the oldest preserved one within the Brandenburg state. In 1928, the Telefunken company erected a radio station in the subdivision of Sch√∂nefeld for the wireless communication with North America. Together with the Nauen Transmitter Station, it was incorporated by the Reichspost in 1932. After World War II, the station was used by the Deutsche Post of the GDR until it finally went out of service in 1991.

Originally designed as a sanatorium by the Berlin workers' health insurance corporation, the complex from the beginning of World War I on was a military hospital of the Imperial German Army. During October and November 1916, Adolf Hitler recuperated at Beelitz-Heilst√§tten after being wounded in the leg at the Battle of the Somme. In 1945, Beelitz- Heilst√§tten was occupied by Red Army forces, and the complex remained a Soviet military hospital until 1995, well after the German reunification. In December 1990, Erich Honecker was admitted to Beelitz-Heilst√§tten after being forced to resign as the head of the East German government. Following the Soviet withdrawal, attempts were made to privatize the complex, but they were not entirely successful. Some sections of the hospital remain in operation as a neurological rehabilitation center and as a center for research and care for victims of Parkinson's disease. The remainder of the complex, including the surgery, the psychiatric ward, and a rifle range, was abandoned in 1994. As of 2007, none of the abandoned hospital buildings or the surrounding area were secured, giving the area the feel of a ghost town. In popular culture This has made Beelitz-Heilst√§tten a destination for curious visitors and a film set for films like The Pianist in 2002, the Rammstein music videohttp://www.rammstein.de/en/news/single-vo-video-premiere-mein-herz- brennt/ \\"Mein Herz brennt\\", and the films Valkyrie in 2008, Men & Chicken in 2015 and A Cure for Wellness in 2016. Beelitz-Heilst√§tten is a popular location for urban exploration, providing a suitably eerie photographic subject for artistic photography.

Murphy played as a defender, but also operated through midfield. He currently holds the club record at Carlisle United for the most appearances for the club as an outfield player with over 400, before being released after 12 years of service in 2013. ==Playing career== Club Murphy played his youth football at St Josephs Boys AFC football club in Dublin. He then went on to play for Blackburn Rovers, Halifax Town (on loan, scoring his first career goal in a match against Kidderminster Harriers) and Carlisle United. While at Brunton Park Murphy started 400+ games and scored the winning goal in the Conference National Playoff Final 2005, which ensured The Cumbrians return to the Football League. On their return, Murphy also played a major part in the team that won the League Two title in 2006 and that narrowly missed out on the League One play-offs in 2007. Murphy was out of contract at the end of the 2006‚Äì07 season initially rejecting an offer of a new contract. In July 2007, Murphy accepted a new contract from Carlisle United, signing a two-year contract. On 3 April 2011, Murphy scored the winning goal in the final of the Football League Trophy at Wembley Stadium against Brentford. Two days before the match, Murphy's partner Lisa gave birth to a baby son. Murphy has become a Carlisle favourite because of his upbeat personality, and his record for most games of any outfield player in club history. On 7 October there was a testimonial match to mark his 10+ years of service with the Cumbrian club, in which a host of ex-Carlisle superstars took to the field on Brunton Park, with Grant Holt, Danny Graham, Keiren Westwood and Ian Harte all making the trip to Cumbria for this special occasion to celebrate his loyalty and service to Carlisle United. At the end of the 2012‚Äì13 season, Murphy was released by Carlisle. Five Months after his release from Carlisle United, Murphy joined Carlisle based non-league side Celtic Nation. On 24 July 2014, Murphy signed for Scottish League One club Ayr United. He scored his first goal for the club in a 3‚Äì2 defeat to Airdrieonians. Murphy spent three seasons with the Honest Men, before being released on 10 May 2017 after the club's relegation from the Scottish Championship. International Murphy is a former Ireland under-19 and under-21 international, playing in the UEFA Under-19 Championships in 1999. In May 2007, Murphy received his first call up to the senior Republic of Ireland squad for the two-game American tour against Ecuador and Bolivia. Murphy's international d√©but came against Bolivia when he started the match before being substituted at half time. This appearance meant he became first Carlisle United player to win full international honours while with the Brunton Park club since Eric Welsh, who won four caps for Northern Ireland in the 1960s. ==Managerial career== Murphy's first managerial appointment came with Scottish League Two side Annan Athletic, where he was appointed player/manager on 2 June 2017.

As taken from the album's booklet: \\"Ten songs, ten wheels of time To be buried in the body, Grave of the mind - Chained to an infinite universe Where night is the rule Ten songs, ten pills To make the known look unknown And the ancient feel new - Pills against the ageless ills Ten songs, ten rites To purify the spirit - Demons talking hard And demons talking soft: First, Gebura, for justice Second, Munin for knowledge Third, Munch, for creativity Fourth, Epictetus, for virtue Then Dionysus, for pleasure Sixth, Diabolos, for music Seventh, the Virgin, for fertility Eighty, the Prophet, for charity Ninth, Odin, for protection Last, for light, the sungod Apollon Ten songs, ten stories of Extreme music science - Solefald proceed to play In Harmonia Universali\\" == Track listing == All lyrics written by Cornelius. # \\"Nutrisco et Extinguo\\" ‚Äì 7:11 # \\"Mont Blanc Providence Crow\\" ‚Äì 5:16 # \\"Christiania (Edvard Munch Commemoration)\\" ‚Äì 8:20 # \\"Epictetus & Irreversibility\\" ‚Äì 5:58 # \\"Dionysify This Night of Spring\\" ‚Äì 8:12 # \\"Red Music Diabolos\\" ‚Äì 4:34 # \\"Buy My Sperm\\" ‚Äì 4:35 # \\"Fraternit√© de la Grande Lumi√®re\\" ‚Äì 5:12 # \\"The Liberation of Destiny\\" ‚Äì 6:28 # \\"Sonnenuntergang im Weltraum\\" ‚Äì 4:32 In the album's booklet, the songs \\"Red Music Diabolos\\" and \\"Dionysify this Night of Spring\\" are incorrectly listed track five and track six, respectively. == Critical reception == Blabbermouth.net's review was favorable, writing, \\"in a mire of screaming pocket Satanists, Solefald offer a tangible break from the norm. That their desire for experimentation has previously led to threats from conservative black metal zealots must surely be recommendation enough for you to bend your brain around this album.\\" == Personnel == * Lazare ‚Äì vocals, Hammond B3, grand piano, drums * Cornelius ‚Äì vocals, electric guitar, classical guitar, bass guitar, samples  Session musicians  * Kjetil Selvik ‚Äì saxophone on \\"Nutrisco et Extinguo\\", \\"Dionysify This Night of Spring\\" and \\"Fraternit√© de la Grande Lumi√©re\\", choir vocals on \\"Christiana (Edvard Munch Commemoration)\\" and \\"Dionisify This Night of Spring\\" * Kristian Kr√ºger ‚Äì choir vocals on \\"Christiana (Edvard Munch Commemoration)\\" and \\"Dionisify This Night of Spring\\" * Sigurd H√∏ye ‚Äì choir vocals on \\"Christiana (Edvard Munch Commemoration)\\" and \\"Dionisify This Night of Spring\\" == References == Category:Solefald albums Category:2003 albums Category:Concept albums ","title":"In Harmonia Universali"},{"id":"5602060","text":"Spaichingen (Swabian: Spoachenga) is a town in the district of Tuttlingen in Baden-W√ºrttemberg, Germany.

Fossils have been found in the United States and a possible specimen in Belgium and Africa. A well-preserved specimen of Platecarpus shows that it fed on moderate-sized fish, and it has been hypothesized to have fed on squid, and ammonites as well. Like other mosasaurs, it was initially thought to have swum in an eel- like fashion, although another study suggests that it swam more like modern sharks. An exceptionally well-preserved specimen of P. tympaniticus known as LACM 128319 shows skin impressions, pigments around the nostrils, bronchial tubes, and the presence of a high-profile tail fluke, showing that it and other mosasaurs did not necessarily have an eel-like swimming method, but were more powerful, fast swimmers. It is held in the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. ==Description== Skull in Naturmuseum Senckenberg Platecarpus had a long, down-turned tail with a large dorsal lobe on it, steering flippers, and jaws lined with conical teeth. It grew up to long, with half of that length taken up by its tail. The platecarpine mosasaurs had evolved into the very specialized plioplatecarpine group by the end of the Cretaceous. The skull structure of Platecarpus is unique among mosasaurs. This genus is characterized by a short skull, and has fewer teeth than any other mosasaur (around 10 teeth in each dentary).Burnham (1991) recently reported an unclassified species of Plioplatecarpus from the Lower Demopolis Formation in Alabama that has a lower number of teeth in its jaws. LACM 128319 preserves matter within the sclerotic ring that may possibly be the retina of the eye. Small structures in the retina, each around 2 ¬µm long and observed by scanning electron microspectroscopy, may represent retinal melanosomes preserved in their original positions. Size comparison The respiratory tube is also known in LACM 128319, preserved as cartilaginous tracheal rings. Only the posterior- most end of the tracheal tube ‚Äì at the end of the neck near the pectoral girdle ‚Äì is known. The section where the two bronchi split was also preserved in the specimen, but was destroyed during excavation. This is an indication that Platecarpus and other mosasaurs had two functional lungs. Snakes, which are closely related to mosasaurs, have only one functional lung with the second often being vestigial or absent. Unlike terrestrial lizards, however, the bronchi separate in front of the area of the forelimbs rather than at the level of the limbs. Soft tissues in the head and neck of specimen LACM 128319: Tracheal rings are shown in the bottom three photographs. Skin impressions are known from Platecarpus, preserved in LACM 128319 as soft impressions and phosphate material. Scales on the tip of the snout and the top of the skull are somewhat hexagonal in shape and do not touch one another. The scales on the jaws are longer and rhomboidal in shape, overlapping one another. The scales on the snout indicate that the nostrils were placed far in front of the skull at its tip and faced laterally as in most squamates and archosaurs. The body scales are all rhomboidal in shape and form tightly connecting diagonal rows that overlap each other at their posterior edges. They are generally the same size throughout the entire length of the body. The caudal scales on the tail are taller and larger than those of the rest of the body, although those covering the lower surface of the tail are more similar to body scales. LACM 128319 Life reconstruction of same specimen Internal organs, or viscera, may also be preserved in the specimen as reddish areas. One is located in the thoracic cavity low in the ribcage, while the other is located in the upper portion of the abdominal cavity just behind the ribcage. The reddish areas were analysed with mass spectrometry and were shown to contain high levels of compounds made of iron and porphyrin. These substances are evidence of hemoglobin decomposition products that may have formed in the organs as they decomposed. Based on its position, the organ in the thoracic cavity is probably the heart or liver, or even both of those organs. The organ in the abdominal cavity may be a kidney, although it is in a more anterior position than the kidneys of monitor lizards, mosasaurs' closest living relatives. The anterior position of the kidneys may have been an adaptation toward a more streamlined body, as their presumed position is similar to that of cetaceans. Platecarpus skeleton Part of the digestive tract is also preserved and is filled with mid-sized fish remains. The shape of these remains may outline the true shape of the corresponding part of the digestive tract, most likely the colon. The presence of scales and undigested bones in the colon suggests that Platecarpus and other mosasaurs processed food quickly and did not thoroughly digest and absorb all food in the gastrointestinal tract. Coprolites from the mosasaur Globidens are also suggestive of low digestion and absorption rates as they contain masses of crushed bivalve shells. The caudal, or tail vertebrae, are sharply downturned. The vertebrae at the bend (called the caudal peduncle) are wedge-shaped with neural spines that are wider at their ends than they are at their bases. This downturned area likely supported a fluke similar to modern sharks. Two lobes would have been present, a lower one supported by the downturned vertebrae and an upper, unsupported one. The tail fluke was probably hypocercal, meaning that its lower lobe was longer than its upper lobe. This condition is also seen in ichthyosaurs and metriorhynchid crocodyliforms. ==History== Fossils Various skeletons of this mosasaur have been found in Cretaceous deposits in Kansas, but only one complete skull has ever been recovered.Everhart, Michael J.. Oceans of Kansas: A Natural History of the Western Interior Seaway. c. 2005. pp. 165‚Äì169 Platecarpus fossils have been found in rocks that date back to the late Coniacian through the early Campanian in the Smoky Hill Chalk. Taxonomic history Skeleton in Naturhistorisches Museum Wien Specimen in Naturalis Leiden formerly referred to P. ictericus P. somenensis type specimen Platecarpus was often regarded as the most common genus of mosasaur in the Western Interior Sea during the deposition of the Smoky Hill Chalk in Kansas, and Platecarpus ictericus was regarded as the most commonly occurring species. However, scientists now consider it to be of the paraphyletic genus. Therefore, some species were reassigned to their own genera. The type specimen of Platecarpus planiforns was discovered by Professor B. F. Mudge and was classified by Edward Drinker Cope as Clidastes planiforns. In 1898, on further analysis of the remains, it was determined that the mosasaur be placed in the genus Platecarpus.Williston (1898a) The type specimen underwent another taxonomic review in 1967, when paleontologist Dale Russell determined that the remains were too fragmentary to place within any genus, and deemed it a specimen of \\"uncertain taxonomic position\\".Russell (1967) A 2006 discovery in the Smoky Hill Chalk of Kansas re-affirmed this position with the discovery a complete fossilized skull being unearthed.(Everhart and Johnson, 2001) In 2011, a new generic name, Plesioplatecarpus, was erected by Takuya Konishi and Michael W. Caldwell to incorporate P. planifrons, which they found was distinct from Platecarpus in a phylogenetic analysis. In 1994, Angolasaurus was synonymized with this genus.Lingham-Soliar T. 1994. The mosasaur \\"Angolasaurus\\" bocagei (Reptilia: Mosasauridae) from the Turonian of Angola reinterpreted as the earliest member of the genus Platecarpus. Palaeont. Z. 68 (1/2): 267‚Äì282. However, many recent studies re-validate this genus. Furthermore, Platecarpus is considered monotypic, as P. coryphaeus and P. ictericus were synonymized with its type species, P. tympaniticus.Kiernan CR, 2002. Stratigraphic distribution and habitat segregation of mosasaurs in the Upper Cretaceous of western and central Alabama, with an historical review of Alabama mosasaur discoveries. Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology 22 (1): 91‚Äì103. The cladogram below follows the most resolved topology from a 2011 analysis by paleontologists Takuya Konishi and Michael W. Caldwell. ==Paleobiology== Diet Restoration of the skull, showing dentition Compared to the tylosaurs, plioplatecarpine mosasaurs had much less robust teeth, suggesting that they fed on smaller (or softer) prey such as small fish and squid. Locomotion Outdated depiction with an anguilliform-like swimming motion and without tail-fluke While mosasaurs are traditionally thought to have propelled themselves through the water by lateral ungulation in a similar way to eels, the deep caudal fin of Platecarpus suggests that it swam more like a shark. The downturned caudal vertebrae of Platecarpus suggest it had a crescent-shaped tail fluke. At the point of the tail where the fluke begins the vertebral centra are shortened and disk-like. Their reduced size likely allowed for greater flexibility at an area that would have experienced high stresses during swimming. The neural spines of these vertebrae also have grooves for the insertion of interspinal ligaments and dorsal connective tissues which would have aided in lateral movement of the fluke. The ligaments were probably made of collagenous fibers that acted as springs to move the tail back into a resting position after energy was stored in them. These types of ligaments work in some living fish to conserve energy during repetitive bending of the tail. While the fluke and back of the tail undulated in Platecarpus, the base of the tail remained stable. This form of movement is known as carangiform locomotion. Reconstruction showing bi-lobed tail fluke The structure of the scales of Platecarpus may have been another adaptation toward a marine lifestyle. The small size and similar shape of these scales throughout the body would have stiffened the trunk, making it more resistant to lateral movement. This stiffness would have improved hydrodynamic efficiency by improving the flow of water across the body. The early mosasauroid Vallecillosaurus also preserves body scales, but they are larger and more varied in shape, suggesting that the animal relied on undulatory movement in its trunk rather than just its tail. Plotosaurus, a more derived mosasaur than Platecarpus, has even smaller scales covering its body, indicating that it had even more efficient locomotion in the water. ==NotesReferencesFurther reading== Williston 1898 ‚Äì includes drawings of the skull of Platecarpus ictericus Category:Russellosaurins Category:Mosasaurs of North America Category:Fossil taxa described in 1869 Category:Santonian genus first appearances Category:Campanian genus extinctions Category:Taxa named by Edward Drinker Cope Category:Mooreville Chalk ","title":"Platecarpus"},{"id":"5602075","text":"Tiberia is a genus of minute parasitic sea snails, marine gastropod molluscs in the family Pyramidellidae, the pyrams and their allies.WoRMS (2010).

Originally named Kolposaurus (meaning \\"bay lizard\\") by Berkeley paleontologist Charles Lewis Camp in 1942, it was changed to Plotosaurus in 1951 when Camp discovered the name had already been assigned to a type of nothosaur. ==Description== Restoration of P. bennisoni Plotosaurs possessed several adaptations to marine life not seen in other mosasaurs. Compared with their relatives, they had narrower flippers, large tail fins and a streamlined fusiform body shape. These features probably enabled them to be faster swimmers than most other mosasaurs. They also had relatively large eyes for keen eyesight, and impressions found with their fossils suggest that they had scaly skin. Based on cladistic analysis, plotosaurs are considered to be the most derived branch of mosasaur evolution. ==Species== The type species, P. bennisoni, was named for Allan Bennison, a fossil hunter who discovered the first remains in 1937. It was around long, and was the first known mosasaur from California (a year previously, Bennison had also discovered the state's first dinosaur, a species of Saurolophus that is now known as Augustynolophus). A second species, P. tuckeri, was also found in 1937 by Frank Paiva and Professor William M. Tucker. Although not quite as advanced in aquatic adaptations as P. bennisoni, it was about 40% larger, reaching lengths of around . However, a recent analysis by Lindgren, Caldwell and Jagt (2008) considers P. tuckeri to be a junior synonym of P. bennisoni. ==Palaeobiology== Plotosaurus is considered to be the most derived species of mosasaur. Studies of Plotosaurus indicate that the animal utilized its pectoral flippers to aid in creating added bursts of speed when attacking prey, utilizing a breaststroke motion, based on the large muscle attachments on the pectoral girdle and asymmetry of the mosasaur's bone structure.https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/09/190923140812.htm ==References== * Camp, C.L. 1942.

According to Anderson's complaint filed with the court, in October 1982, Anderson met with Art Linkletter, a member of MGM's Board of Directors, at his Bel Air home; with Freddy Fields, then-president of MGM/UA at his Culver City office; and also had meetings during the Summer of 1983 with then-Board Chairman Frank Yablans and MGM/UA Vice President Peter Bart. During the meetings, they discussed using Anderson's script for Rocky IV. Anderson claimed that MGM told him that if they used his script he would be paid a large sum of money. Anderson also met with Stallone in May 1983 at Stallone's Paramount Pictures office in a meeting arranged and attended by then-Deputy White House Chief of Staff Michael Deaver. The case was argued before District Judge William D. Keller of the Central District of California. The Court concluded that the Defendants are entitled to their motion for summary judgment because Anderson's script is an infringing work not entitled to copyright protection. The Court determined that the characters from the original movies were afforded copyright protection, using a standard borrowed from Judge Learned Hand in Nichols v. Universal Pictures Corp.. The key to the standard is that copyright protection is afforded when a character is developed with enough specificity to constitute protectable expression. It was strikingly clear to the Court that Anderson's work was a derivative work; that under 17 U.S.C. section 106(2) derivative works are the exclusive privilege of the copyright holder (Stallone, in this case); and that since Anderson's work is unauthorized, no part of it can be given protection. Anderson attempted to argue that Congressional history of 17 U.S.C. section 103(a) indicates that Congress intended non-infringing portions of derivative works to be protected. The Court disagreed, citing legal scholarship (copyright law professors Melville and David Nimmer) and case law interpretations of 103(a). ==External links== * Anderson v.

During the training, he says several words that Johnny cannot understand such as \\"himu jaba\\", which is in fact one of the boxing combination moves. Near the end of the training, Johnny became upset when his trainer says lots of gibberish and beats Benjo up which Johnny interpreted as the trainer's orders. In the second part, Ang Boxing Coach, the amateur match between Johnny Santos and Ricky Marcelo (Dennis Trillo) is about to begin. Before the start of the match, Benjo came and told about the bad news that Johnny's trainer has H1N1 (interpreted by Benjo as \\"Hini\\") and was hospitalized, and once again, Benjo substituted but Johnny disagreed because of his misunderstood words. Benjo said to forget about it and reconcile, focus in the match, and listen to every move he says. Johnny was doing pretty well, until the trainer said \\"himu jaba\\", one of the words Johnny cannot understand (the other two words were \\"himo dede boobi\\" and \\"katumachiku jumama poompoom\\") which causes the boxer to hold back and knocked out by his opponent until he lost after the third knockout. After the fight, Ricky thanked Benjo for his \\"professional\\" coaching because of his \\"simple\\" words that Johnny cannot understand. In fact, he told Johnny one of the \\"moves\\"' real meaning (i.e. Katumachiku jumana poompoom which means Jab, straight, hook, uppercut).

He is an obvious parody of MadTV's Coach Hines. It is revealed in the June 29, 2012 episode, Lamay (Wake) that his first name is Hector, which makes his name a play on the famous PBA player Hector Calma. - Daddy Dearest 2012  An obvious parody as well as a teaser for the then-upcoming drama-comedy My Daddy Dearest.

It was briefly revived in 2001 and 2005. The show experienced a resurfacing in the late 2011 and is broadcast once a month. It is a parody of the religious television program Ang Dating Daan (English: The Old Path), which is produced by the Members Church of God International. At first, the nursery rhyme \\"Row Row Row Your Boat\\" was the opening and closing theme used from 1998 to 1999. In the same year however, it comically began to use instead the opening theme of the anime television series Ch≈çdenji Machine Voltes V (\\"Voltes V no Uta\\" by Mitsuko Horie, Koorogi '73 and Columbia Cradle Club), as both its opening and closing song. It was of perfect timing, since it was a way of promoting Voltes V for the network back then. Origins The sketch was headlined by the show's writers, Isko Salvador (as Brod Pete, a play on the name of actor Brad Pitt and also a parody of Bro. Eli Soriano, Overall Servant of MCGI and host of Ang Dating Daan), Cesar Cosme (as Brother Willy, parody of Bro. Willy Santiago, who in 2009 broke away from MCGI and established the Members Church of God in Jesus Christ Worldwide), and Chito Francisco (as Brother Jocel, parody of Bro. Josel Mallari). The recent popularity of the religious program Ang Dating Daan and its sister program, Itanong Mo kay Soriano, [Biblia ang Sasagot] (Ask Soriano, [and the Bible Will Answer]), inspired the segment. Because of its popularity, their characters became their nicknames. Format The segment would commonly begin and end with Voltes V no Uta as the theme song; afterwards, various members of the audience would come up and present various questions to Brod Pete, who then has Brother Willy read various extracts from Nursery Rhymes or Folk songs, and recently on the 2011 revival, various song lyrics. Brod Pete will then interpret the \\"passage\\" to answer the question presented. Instead of using the Bible, they used dictionary, phone directory, or any other books. In the 2011 revival, they began to use Macbook Pros and iPads as reference materials, which leads to its new title, Ang Bagong Dating Doon (The New Formerly There), meaning \\"Ang Dating Doon\\" with the power of technology. On the June 27, 2014 episode of Bubble Gang, the segment sported a new set, the trio now wearing suits, and the name tweaked to Ang Bagong Dating Doon International (The New Formerly There International). This change reflects the new formats of Ang Dating Daan and Itanong Mo Kay Soriano, wherein MCGI's Mass Indoctrinations and Worldwide Bible Expositions, respectively, replaced the previous ones, since Bro. Eli Soriano went in exile in 2010. Various exclamations such as \\"Alien!\\" or Raise the Roof! would also be used (as a parody of the common exclamations Amen and Praise the Lord). A running gag in the show is that Brother Jocel sleeps during the segment proper (he is often seen with his head resting on his arms on the desk, though this has not been the case on some episodes). In the 2011 revival and onwards, he is sometimes seen playing games with his iPad, most notably, according to him, is Temple Run, or checking his \\"Facebook account\\" for status updates (while often seen still resting his head on the desk). Notes * Isko Salvador and Cesar Cosme once worked on the legendary sitcom John En Marsha. * There are also brief revivals of Ang Dating Doon since the first incarnation of the segment ended. First, when Isko Salvador went to ABS-CBN and became a regular of the gag show Klasmeyts, he revived Ang Dating Doon but with a variation. The segment features the same concept and the same usage of exclamations \\"Alien\\" and \\"Raise the Roof,\\" but changes the segment title into \\"Doon Dati\\" (also meaning \\"Formerly There\\") in reference to the segment's tenure in Bubble Gang. The theme song was also changed from Voltes V opening theme to the opening theme of T≈çsh≈ç Daimos (\\"Tate! T≈çsh≈ç Daimos\\" by Isao Sasaki and Columbia Cradle Club). In a satire of the then- heated rivalry between Ang Dating Daan and Iglesia ni Cristo, Doon Dati has a sister segment named \\"May Tama Kami\\" (\\"We Are Nuts\\", lit. \\"We Are Correct\\"), a parody of Iglesia ni Cristo show Ang Tamang Daan. Hosted by Bayani Agbayani and Herbert Bautista, who play as parodies of Bro. Michael Sandoval and Bro. Maximo Bularan, Jr., the show focuses on rebuking Brod. Pete's teachings through nursery rhymes and children's folk tales in a similar manner to Brod Pete's. * The comedy show Ispup made a parody of Ang Dating Daan and its rival Ang Tamang Daan entitled Ang Sangang Daan (\\"The Branched-Out Path\\"), hosted by John Lapus and Leo Martinez. It was shown on TV5, then known as ABC 5. * There is also another segment based on Ang Dating Doon, this time calling it Ang Daming Daan (\\"Many Paths\\" or \\"Many Hundreds\\"), which was shown on ABC's gag show Teka Mona! This segment was hosted by Joey de Leon as Bro. Elvis Soriano (a parody of Bro. Eli Soriano with an Elvis Presley look), who usually seen with his guitar, and Mike \\"Pekto\\" Nacua as Brother Hud, Bro. Elvis' Judas Iscariot-like assistant (his name was a pun on the word \\"brotherhood\\"). the concept was as same as Ang Dating Doon, except for the fact that every question is worth P100.00 and it will be put into a fishbowl after the question was answered (a parody of one of the accusations to MCGI by INC wherein Bro. Eli allegedly charges his followers with a large sum of money). * The Trio made a cameo appearance at the film D'Sisters Nuns of the Above starring Michael V and Vic Sotto and Tweets For My Sweet. * Despite having a show in Bubble Gang, Brod Pete (Isko Salvador) became a judge in It's Showtime. * Brod. Pete is also a segment host for the UNTV show Klasrum (formerly as Bread Tambayan). Ironically, UNTV is the current home of Ang Dating Daan, and one of the owners of the network is Daniel Razon, nephew of Eli Soriano and the Vice Overall Servant of MCGI.

One example is this dialogue: Mr. Assimo: Jorge, Ipa-print mo nga itong mga papers. Pakibilisan lang ha? (Jorge, please print these papers. Quickly.) Jorge: Sir, i-piprint ko po, di ba? (Sir, I will print it, right?) Mr. Assimo: Hindi. I-fafax mo, para may makatanggap na iba at sila ang mag- paprint para sakin!

A Miller & Richard composing stick, showing the adjustment mechanism (left side) In letterpress printing and typesetting, a composing stick is a tray-like tool used to assemble pieces of metal type into words and lines, which are then transferred to a galley before being locked into a forme and printed. Many composing sticks have one adjustable end, allowing the length of the lines and consequent width of the page or column to be set, with spaces and quadrats of different sizes being used to make up the exact width. Early composing sticks often had a fixed measure, as did many used in setting type for newspapers, which were fixed to the width of a standard column, when newspapers were still composed by hand. The compositor takes the pieces of type from the boxes (compartments) of the type case and places them in the composing stick, working from left to right and placing the letters upside- down with the nick to the top. Early composing sticks were made of wood, but later iron, brass, steel, aluminium, pewter and other metals were used. Wooden composing sticks continued to be made in large sizes into the nineteenth century, for setting wood letter and other large sizes of type for display. In the industrial age, composing sticks were manufactured by many companies, but notably in America by the H. B. Rouse company, which made composing sticks that were adjustable to the half pica, as well as a stick containing a micrometer that was infinitely adjustable.

He has been involved mainly with the Fantastic Four, as enemy, ally and even short-term member. ==Publication history== Kristoff first appeared in John Byrne's \\"back to the basics\\" Fantastic Four run in issue #247 in October 1982. Kristoff served as heir to Doctor Doom, occasional ruler of Latveria, a probationary member of the Fantastic Four, and temporal adventurer alongside Nathaniel Richards. The character next appears in Fantastic Four #258-259 (September‚ÄìOctober 1983) and first appears as the second Doctor Doom in Fantastic Four #278-279 (May‚ÄìJune 1985). After a few scattered appearances, Kristoff Vernard becomes a semi-regular cast member in Fantastic Four #400 (May 1995). He recently reappeared in FF #2 ruling Latveria in Doom's absence. An alternate future version appeared as an adult in the MC2 universe, beginning in A-Next #5 (1998), followed by scattered appearances, but was only featured regularly in Fantastic Five #1-5 (September‚ÄìNovember 2007). Doctor Doom received an entry in the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Update '89 #2, and the All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z #12 (2007). ==Fictional character biography== Heir After being ousted as leader of Latveria, Dr. Doom returned to the country with the Fantastic Four to overthrow its then-leader, Zorba. Doom met the young Kristoff and his mother. While conversing with them, Kristoff's mother was killed by one of Zorba's robots for violating curfew.Fantastic Four vol. 1 #247 Furious at the death of a woman who was standing in his presence and therefore should have been regarded as being under his protection, Doom destroyed the robot and defeated Zorba. Dr. Doom adopted Kristoff as his heir and took him to live in Castle Doom.Fantastic Four vol. 1 #258 Second Coming of Doom left Following the apparent murder of Dr. Doom by Terrax, Doom's robots took Kristoff and brainwashed and implanted within him Doom's mental patterns and detailed memories. However, he stopped the process before all of Doom's memories could be implanted (after his intellect had been duplicated). Now believing that he was the real Doom, Kristoff's first action was attempting to destroy the Fantastic Four by blowing up the Baxter Building,Fantastic Four vol. 1 #278 a plan drawn from memories of the real Dr. Doom's plot to kill the FF while he was teamed with the Sub-Mariner. The FF survived the explosion thanks to the force fields of Sue Richards, something Kristoff had not anticipated because he had stopped the memory transfer at a point before Sue Richards had fully developed her force field abilities. The FF quickly traveled to Doomstadt and defeated their adversary. To the team's surprise, the armor held not Doom but a child, whom the team took with them. Kristoff would be imprisoned in Four Freedoms Plaza, the new home of the Four, following his destruction of the Baxter Building.Fantastic Four vol. 1 #279 He was still convinced that he was Doom and Mister Fantastic hoped to restore him to his normal personality. At this time the real Dr. Doom \\"returned from the dead\\". Kristoff would free himself with the aid of a Doombot sent to kidnap Franklin Richards, son of Mister Fantastic and the Invisible Woman,Fantastic Four Annual #20 by the recently resurrected Dr. Doom. Doom wanted to use Franklin as a bargaining chip for the soul of his mother which was held captive by Mephisto. Although still a child of about four or five, Franklin had powerful psychic powers which had enabled him to defeat Mephisto in a previous encounter.Fantastic Four vol. 1 #227 This time, Doom's power inhibitors prevented Franklin from fighting the demon, who agreed to the bargain. But at that very moment, Kristoff, in full armor, burst in with an army of Doombots and challenged Doom, whom he thought to be an impostor. The FF, who had followed Kristoff in order to rescue Franklin, intervened and Mister Fantastic used a device of his own to enable his son to fight back against Mephisto. As the two Dooms battled, the Doombots stood by, unsure which to aid since they both claimed to be Doom and the brainscans seemed to confirm this. The battle soon ended but Doom's mother was still not free. Her imprisonment in the nether realms was one of the few failures that Doom would admit to and he said as much to those present. The robots perceived this as doubt and a lack of confidence meaning Kristoff could only be the real ever- confident Dr. Doom. The Doombots turned on their creator and Dr. Doom was forced to flee. Kristoff ruled Latveria as Doom once again, where he would encounter the West Coast Avengers. To their surprise, he let them leave Latveria.West Coast Avengers #35 He stayed the regent until the original infiltrated the Castle and uttered a codeword that reverted Kristoff to his original personality.Fantastic Four vol. 1 #350 Doom reclaimed his throne while Kristoff was sent as a decoy to battle Mr. Fantastic. He was killedFantastic Four vol. 1 #352 and placed in stasis in a Tibetan Monastery. Life After Doom Nathaniel Richards revived Kristoff Fantastic Four vol. 1 #397 along with Boris, Doom's former guardian, who was actually the Tomorrow Man in disguise. The former dictator returned with Richards and the Invisible Woman, where he became a closely monitored member of the Fantastic Four, and close friends with Cassandra Lang, daughter of Ant-Man (Scott Lang) who had also joined the team following the \\"death\\" of Mister Fantastic. He eventually took his leave from the group to go with Nathaniel Richards. He was reunited with Doom Fantastic Four #406 when the alternate future offspring of Franklin Richards and Rachel Summers called Hyperstorm, attacked the Fantastic Four Fantastic Four #409 where he chose to help them instead of attacking them at their weakest. The group defeated Hyperstorm. Following the Onslaught saga, Kristoff and Nathaniel tried to collect the now-missing FF's equipment located in the Negative Zone. They then returned to Latveria, Kristoff with hopes of assuming the throne once again, but they were met with resistance by the Dreadknight and found Doombots in charge. The duo were then tricked by S.H.I.E.L.D. into defeating them.Tales of the Marvel Universe #1 Kristoff and Nathaniel were later displaced by Stryfe after his ship crashed into Castle Doom. Nathaniel Richards has hinted that he is Kristoff's father, which gives something of an irony that Doctor Doom chose, as his heir, the half-brother of his most hated rival. At the start of Fantastic Four: Three, Doom was making plans to abdicate his throne and give it to Kristoff, who is referred to as living in \\"exile\\". Kristoff was then revealed to be the villain in the Spider- Man/Fantastic Four miniseries, setting up an elaborate plan to depose Doom and take his place- such as setting up a riot at the Latverian embassy in the past so that he could read some books of magic that Doom had lost in the present,Spider-Man/Fantastic Four #1 acquiring samples of the Venom symbiote in order to create a 'symbiote bomb'Spider-Man/Fantastic Four #2 that he could secretly 'sell' to DoomMighty Avengers #7 to take him out of the pictureMighty Avengers #10\\\\- culminating in him seeking the aid of Spider-Man and the Fantastic Four to help in his final plan, regarding them as Doom's greatest enemies. Spider-Man was an 'honorary' member of the FF as he is invariably the first person the team turns to when they require either general outside assistance or just someone to socialise with. Although Kristoff attacks them when they turn him down, claiming that they were willing to just 'forget' him after the Onslaught incident, Spider-Man and the Thing discover an old family photo album which includes pictures of Kristoff's time with the team, the Thing explaining that they have actually never stopped trying to find Kristoff but had long ago run out of ideas about where to actively look. Their original search had failed because Kristoff was hiding away in training. Despite this, Kristoff rejects the team and departs in anger, swearing to destroy Doom himself.Spider-Man/Fantastic Four #4 He is subsequently living in Latveria with Doctor Doom, who continues to groom him to be his heir.New Avengers v3 # 6 Kristoff Vernard then hired She-Hulk as his lawyer to apply for political asylum in the United States, but end up facing a small army of Doombots. After defeating the Doombots, She-Hulk succeeds in granting him political asylum only for Doctor Doom to break into the courthouse and kidnap him. She-Hulk then goes to Latveria to rescue Kristoff only for him and Doctor Doom to have a pep-talk, where he expresses his desire to follow his own path in life. After the talk, Doom allows Kristoff and She-Hulk to leave Latveria.She-Hulk Vol. 3 #2-4 ==Powers and abilities== Kristoff Vernard has no superpowers but he's a skilled scientist and magician. He has also worn a suit of armor that grants him some degree of superhuman strength and durability, flight and energy projection. ==Other versions== Franklin Richards: Son of a Genius In the non-canonical humor comic Franklin Richards: Son of a Genius, Kristoff is depicted as a foreign exchange classmate of Franklin's from Latveria making him roughly the same age as him. He shows total admiration for Doctor Doom and much like his idol shows some disdain for the son of his archenemy. Franklin appears to be oblivious to Kristoff's antagonism and believes that he is his genuine friend. House of M Kristoff was a member of Doom's Fearsome Four, as the Inhuman Torch. In the crafted world, Kristoff was the adopted son of Valeria and Doom, and thanks to the cosmic experimentation of his adoptive father, had the abilities of Johnny Storm.House of M: Fantastic Four #1 MC2 In the MC2 universe, Kristoff appears as an ally of the A-Next and the Fantastic Five. He uses the name \\"Doom\\" and has requested membership in the Fantastic Five. He is later shown to have indeed gained membership. His costume is a combination of his old mask and a green version of the F5 uniform. ==In other media== Video games * In the Heroes and Villains expansion pack for Marvel: Ultimate Alliance, Kristoff Vernard is an alternate costume for Doctor Doom. ==Notes== John Byrne revealed his original plans for Kristoff, stating \\"I intended Doom to return to Latvaria and absolutely FREAK OUT when he discovered what his robots had done to Kristoff. Basically -- he'd need a whole lot of new robots by the time he calmed down. And then he would devote a whole lot of time and energy to restoring Kristoff. (I had not decided if he would be successful. Part of my brain wanted him to realize he needed the help of the other smartest guy on the planet -- and there was no way he could ever go there!\\") ==See also== * Doctor Doom ==References== Category:Marvel Comics supervillains Category:Marvel Comics superheroes Category:Marvel Comics 2 Category:Latverians Category:Characters created by John Byrne Category:Comics characters introduced in 1982 Category:Fictional victims of brainwashing and indoctrination ","title":"Kristoff Vernard"},{"id":"5602149","text":"{ class=\\"infobox\\" style=\\"width: 25em; font-size: 90%;\\" - colspan=\\"3\\" bgcolor=\\"#FF0000\\"  center; font-size: larger;\\"  Portal de Suba - colspan=2 { width=100% style=\\"background: #f9f9f9;\\" - style=\\"vertical-align: center; text-align: center;\\" width=40%Terminal' width=20%‚óÑ ‚ñ∫ width=40%La Campi√±a } - Location Avenida Suba with Avenida Ciudad de Cali - Neighborhood Suba - style=\\"vertical-align: center;\\" Opened April 29, 2006 - style=\\"vertical-align: top; text-align: center;\\" } El Portal de Suba is one of the terminus stations of the TransMilenio mass-transit system of Bogot√°, Colombia, which opened in the year 2000. ==Location== Portal de Suba is located in northwestern Bogot√°, specifically on Avenida Suba with Avenida Ciudad de Cali.

It promotes a 'music for all' agenda and wishes to see more musical opportunities for more young people. ==History== The Music Manifesto came about as a result of a collaboration between two government departments (the Department for Education and Skills (DfES), now DCSF, and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS)) and a wide range of music organisations, musicians, teachers, composers, the music industry, broadcasting, teacher and musicians' unions, arts and education charities and Trusts. It was developed through three seminars led by David Miliband MP, the School Standards Minister. An internet discussion board was set up to allow ongoing discussion and input was sought from the Music Advanced Skills Teachers network and the wider National Music Education Forum. While working closely with the DCSF and DCMS, the Music Manifesto remains independent of Government. The Music Manifesto offers a strategic direction for the future of music education and a common agenda for joint action. It has published two reports, the second of which, 'Making Every Child's Music Matter', set out over 50 recommendations for improving music education. ==Aims== The purpose of the Music Manifesto is: * to act as a statement of common intent that helps align currently disparate activity. * to set out a shared agenda for future planning across the sector. * to make it easier for more organisations and individuals to see how they can contribute to music education. * to guide Government's own commitment to music education. * to call on the wider community, including the public, private and community sectors, to join in enriching the lives of schoolchildren. The campaign's Five Key Aims are: * to provide every young person with first access to a range of music experiences * to provide more opportunities for young people to deepen and broaden their musical interests and skills * to identify and nurture our most talented young musicians * to develop a world- class workforce in music education * to improve the support structures for young people's music making. ==Campaigns== The latest project supported by the Music Manifesto is In Harmony, a programme inspired by Venezuela's El Sistema, which gives free instrumental tuition to young children in some of the country's most deprived areas. In November 2007, the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families, Ed Balls, recognised the contribution of the Music Manifesto when he announced a ¬£332 million funding package for music education. The Music Manifesto's ¬£40 million National Singing Programme, Sing Up, was launched in November 2007 and aims to put singing at the heart of every primary school. The Wider Opportunities programme aims to give all Key Stage 2 pupils the chance to play an instrument. From 2005-08, three Music Manifesto Pathfinder organisations developed a range of projects designed to offer young people access to inspiring, quality music provision. For 2008-09 five partnership programmes have been funded to provide music activities in line with the Manifesto's aims. ==External links== *Archived Music Manifesto website, UK Government Web Archive *Sing Up website Youth Music, the UK charity which provides music making opportunities for young people aged 0‚Äì18 with least opportunity is a Music Manifesto signatory *Youth Music website Category:Music education organizations Category:Music organisations based in the United Kingdom ","title":"Music Manifesto"},{"id":"5602166","text":"R√∂thenbach may refer to: *in Germany **in Bavaria ***R√∂thenbach an der Pegnitz, a city ***R√∂thenbach (Allg√§u), a municipality ***R√∂thenbach bei Sankt Wolfgang, part of the municipality of Wendelstein ***R√∂thenbach (Altdorf bei N√ºrnberg), part of the municipality of Altdorf bei N√ºrnberg ***R√∂thenbach bei Schweinau, in the city of N√ºrnberg ***R√∂thenbach (Arzberg Oberfranken), in the municipality of Arzberg (Oberfranken), Wunsiedel im Fichtelgebirge ***R√∂thenbach (Griesst√§tt), in the municipality of Griesst√§tt, Rosenheim ***R√∂thenbach (Reuth bei Erbendorf), in the municipality of Reuth bei Erbendorf, Tirschenreuth ***R√∂thenbach (Kohlberg), in the municipality of Kohlberg (Oberpfalz), Neustadt an der Waldnaab **in Saxony ***R√∂thenbach (Rodewisch), in the municipality of Rodewisch, Vogtlandkreis ***R√∂thenbach (Pretzschendorf), in the municipality of Pretzschendorf, Wei√üeritzkreis *in Switzerland **R√∂thenbach bei Herzogenbuchsee, a municipality in the canton of Berne **R√∂thenbach im Emmental, a municipality in the canton of Berne ==See also== *Rothenbach (disambiguation) ","title":"R√∂thenbach"},{"id":"5602167","text":"Bill Legend (born William Arthur Fifield, 8 May 1944, Barking, Essex, England) is an English musician and former drummer for glam rock band T. Rex during their most successful period. ==Biography== One of three children, Legend worked as a commercial artist after leaving school, while playing the drums in a variety of bands. He was drumming under his real name for a group called \\"Legend\\", fronted by Mickey Jupp, when Marc Bolan, the man behind the new- found success of T. Rex, spotted him and asked producer Tony Visconti to approach him. Legend agreed to join T. Rex, immediately buying a number of the band's albums from their days as Tyrannosaurus Rex to familiarise himself with Bolan's previous work. At the time, T.Rex had enjoyed their first hit single with \\"Ride a White Swan\\". Bolan and his percussionist Mickey Finn had already recruited a bassist in Steve Currie, but still needed a drummer to complete the rhythm section of their new electric line-up. At Legend's first session he played drums on \\"Hot Love\\" and the B-side \\"Woodland Rock\\". However T. Rex stayed as a three-piece band for a short period, forcing Finn to mime playing the drums on Top of the Pops when Hot Love was at No. 1. Bolan suggested Legend's stage name, which derived from the name of band he had been playing in with Mickey Jupp. Legend played drums for T. Rex on four albums: Electric Warrior, The Slider, Tanx and Zinc Alloy. The band had four UK No. 1 singles and four UK No. 2 singles in a three-year period, after which it began to disintegrate as the hits dried up. Legend reverted to session drumming afterwards. Legend is the only surviving member of the 1970‚Äì1973 T. Rex line- up. Bolan (in 1977) and Currie (in 1981) both died in car crashes, and Finn succumbed to illness in 2003. Despite signing a petition against the 1997 formation of Mickey Finn's T-Rex, Legend now has his own tribute band called X-T. Rex, which in 2014 was expected to write an album of their own. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Bill Legend's website Category:1944 births Category:Living people Category:People from Barking, London Category:English rock drummers Category:Glam rock musicians Category:T.

Operators of telegraph services regulated the use of telegraphic addresses to prevent duplication. Rather like a uniform resource locator (URL), the telegraph address did not contain any routing information (aside from possibly a city name), but instead could be looked up by telegraph office personnel, who would then manually direct the message to the office nearest the destination or to an intermediate office.

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Alberta from 1909 to 1913. ==Biography== O'Brien was born at Bells Rapids, near Bangor, Hastings County, Ontario to John Patrick and Matilda (n√©e Price) O'Brien. His father, J.P. O'Brien perished in the sinking of the boat the Mayflower at the Madawaska River, in 1912. He worked in the logging, mining industry and in railroad camps. In 1899, he came west to Alberta while working for the railway, the Crowsnest Pass line of the Canadian Pacific Railway. Becoming a \\"dedicated socialist\\", he joined the Socialist Party of Canada and became a national organizer for the party, and leader of its Alberta branch. O'Brien was a skilled orator and author, drawing comparisons to prominent activists Bill Haywood, Jack London and Eugene V. Debs, in terms of his impact in Socialism in Canada. O'Brien ran for the Legislative Assembly of Alberta in 1909 in the new Rocky Mountain constituency, and, despite not garnering official union support but much support among the district's coal-miners, was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Alberta in the 1909 Alberta general election as a member of the Socialist Party of Alberta, narrowly defeating Liberal John Angus Macdonald by 32 votes. He was the first Socialist member elected to the Alberta Legislature. It was said that O'Brien's election to the legislature \\"reflected a growing radicalization\\" of coal miners in Alberta; O'Brien's constituency at the time was mainly miners. The local newspaper, Coleman Miner, blamed his election on his supporters buying the vote of naturalized immigrants, saying: During his term in office, he worked to improve conditions for the miners, having run on that platform in his election bid. In December 1910, he introduced an amendment to the existing Coal Mines Act, proposing many additional safety measures in the industry. O'Brien also initiated a bill permitting the Alberta government to protect an apparent Russian fugitive (charged with murder for assassination of a Russian governor and arson) by refusing to extradite him back to Russia if investigation showed that he faced political persecution back in Russia. He would also participate in the Alberta and Great Waterways Railway debate. O'Brien set a provincial legislative record, delivering a speech to the house on February 13, 1912 that was 5 hours and 50 minutes in length. He still had not finished his speech when the session was adjourned for the day. While in office he continued his Socialist activism, giving speeches to promote it. In 1909 he was arrested while giving a speech near a highway in Regina. A crowd of 500 had gathered to listen, which resulted in O'Brien's arrest for obstructing traffic. An account of his political position is available on-line under the title \\"The Proletarian in Politics The Socialist Position As defended by C. M. O‚ÄôBrien, MLA in the Alberta Legislature.\\" In 1911 he engaged in a Canada-wide tour to promote Socialist ideals. The Trades and Labour Congress of Canada endorsed him when he ran for re-election in 1913. In the 1913 general election, he doubled his vote as compared to 1909 but was defeated by Conservative Robert E. Campbell, by just over 80 votes.

Another version of the game, The Need for Speed: Special Edition, was released in 1996 for the Microsoft Windows, PlayStation and Sega Saturn platforms. The original 3DO version offers eight sport cars, including several exotic models and Japanese imports, and tasks the player with racing in three realistic point-to-point tracks either with or without a computer opponent. Subsequent ports of the game normally include an additional ninth car and have more tracks, including closed circuits. Checkpoints, traffic vehicles, and police pursuits commonly appear in the races. The game was noted for its realism and audio and video commentaries. Electronic Arts collaborated with automotive magazine Road & Track to match vehicle behavior, including the mimicking of the sounds made by the vehicles' gear control levers. The game also contained precise vehicle data with spoken commentary, several \\"magazine-style\\" images of each car interior and exterior and short video clips highlighting the vehicles set to music. The Need for Speed was a commercial success. Video game publications praised the incorporation of realism into the gameplay and graphics, as well as the inclusion of full motion videos. It is the first installment released in the Need for Speed series, which has influenced several racing games. ==Gameplay== The player driving a Chevrolet Corvette on Coastal. The premise of The Need for Speed involves racing in sport cars, including several exotic models and Japanese imports. The original 3DO version includes three point-to-point tracks, each divided into three stages; subsequent ports feature both the point-to-point tracks and new closed circuits. The Saturn and PlayStation versions include an additional three tracks. Traffic vehicles appear in races; the player avoids crashing into them. Police pursuits are also a key gameplay mechanic, with the player ticketed or arrested if a police car succeeds in catching up with them. Players are arrested if they receive a third police ticket (or a second ticket in the Sega Saturn version). In the special edition, completing the tournaments (or entering a cheat) unlocks the \\"rally\\" mode, where car dynamics are changed to make for a faster 'arcade' experience, as well as the \\"Warrior PTO E/2\\", a fictional jet-powered sports car. Except for the aforementioned Warrior, each car in the game comes with detailed specifications, history, audio commentaries and real-life videos, which would also be featured in subsequent games in the series, though this was omitted in later games. A replay feature allowed the player to view a saved race. Multiple camera views, playback speed and video navigation are offered. Multiplayer consists of a two-player head-to-head racing mode, which requires computers connected via modem. There are a total of six courses in the game (three in the 3DO version): City, Coastal, Alpine, Rusty Springs, Autumn Valley and Vertigo. Each is a distinctive environment. City, Coastal and Alpine have three sections each, while the others are circuit races. There is an extra track in the game, named Lost Vegas, which can be unlocked by winning all of the tracks above in tournament mode. A flag in the bottom right corner of the track's image indicates a victory in the menu to help the player keep track of the progress. ==Development and release== Ferrari 512 TR is one of the eight cars included in the original 3DO version of The Need for Speed. The Need for Speed was initially developed and released for the 3DO. The Need for Speed was noted for its realism and audio and video commentaries. Electronic Arts collaborated with automotive magazine Road & Track to match vehicle behavior, including the mimicking of the sounds made by the vehicles' gear control levers.

It includes two new tracks (\\"Transtropolis\\" and \\"Burnt Sienna\\") and various enhancements to the game engine. The Windows 95 version supports DirectX 2 and IPX networking. The Need for Speed: Special Edition is the only game in the Need for Speed series to support MS-DOS, as subsequent releases for the PC only support Windows 9x. A DOS-compatible emulator (like DOSBox) is required for systems that do not natively support it to run the DOS version of The Need for Speed: Special Edition. In June 1995, Atari Corporation struck a deal with EA in order to bring several titles from their catalog (including The Need for Speed) to the Atari Jaguar CD. These ports, along with The Need for Speed, went unreleased. Japanese versions In 1994, Electronic Arts Victor translated the 3DO version of The Need for Speed into Japanese, and released it in Japan as '''''. The PlayStation port of the game was exported to that country as ' in 1996. Two additional Nissan-sponsored versions of the game were announced at that year's Tokyo Game Show: ' (released in 1996 for the Sega Saturn) and ' (released in 1997 for the PlayStation). The former's car lineup consists only of Nissan vehicles, whilst the latter exclusively features Skyline models. ==Reception== Sales The game reached number 5 in the UK sales chart.Gallup UK PlayStation sales chart, August 1996, published in Official UK PlayStation Magazine issue 9 Critical reviews The Need For Speed was met with positive reviews. The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly scored the 3DO version an 8.0 average, with two of them giving the game a 9.0 or higher. They praised the game's realistic graphics and sounds, addictive gameplay, and exceptionally clever use of full motion video. GamePro gave it a rave review as well, commenting that the selection of cars \\"will leave car buffs drooling\\" and the realistic graphics and handling of each vehicle \\"infuse the game with taut realism and fascinating variety.\\" They expressed disappointment over the lack of two-player mode, but felt that the exceptionally challenging enemy AI largely makes up for it. Next Generation reviewed the 3DO version of the game, and stated that \\"while everything is in place for a truly great game, the unfortunate and total need of speed prevents The Need for Speed from ever being more than a pleasant Sunday drive.\\" British magazine PC Power gave the Windows version a score of 95%, praising car handling, graphics and overall presentation, but criticizing hardware requirements and sound. Jim Varner of GameSpot gave the game a \\"Great\\" rating of 8.3/10 citing \\"With its marvelous attention to detail, exotic course design, and straightforward gameplay, this game is a true winner. Simply put, The Need for Speed is the next best thing to owning a $200,000 sports car!\\". The two sports reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly applauded the PlayStation version for its fast racing and excellent controls. Air Hendrix argued in GamePro that \\"With all these improvements, [the PlayStation version] is practically a sequel to the 3DO game, and it plays like one.\\" He made particular mention of the additional courses, the handbrake, the improved displays, and the faster speed of the game. A Next Generation critic likewise found it faster and more responsive than the 3DO version, and held it to be one of the PlayStation's best racing games to date. Other magazines were more critical, with PSM criticising the \\"obtrusive graphics\\", and saying that it \\"isn't an immediately enjoyable game - the idiosyncracies only serve to annoy.\\"Need for Speed review, Official UK PlayStation Magazine, April 1996, issue 5, page 66 Maximum complained that the driving lacks intensity and that cars are too resistant to crashes, though they acknowledged that the graphics are moderately impressive. Air Hendrix rated the Saturn version as \\"comparable with - and occasionally better than - the impressive PlayStation version\\", highlighting the controls in particular as superior to previous versions of the game. He concluded, \\"The gameplay demands both precision driving and cajones, and although mastery takes time to achieve, Need's ultimately more satisfying than Daytona or Sega Rally.\\" Rob Allsetter of Sega Saturn Magazine, however, said that while The Need for Speed is good on its own terms, it looks dated compared to the two games Air Hendrix referenced. He also disliked the game's elements of realism, arguing that racing games are more fun when they indulge in wild fantasy. A Next Generation critic said it was \\"Certainly as fast, but not as crisp as the PlayStation version\\", but nonetheless \\"A better racer than most.\\" The Need for Speed was a runner-up for Computer Gaming Worlds 1995 \\"Action Game of the Year\\" award, which ultimately went to Crusader: No Remorse. The editors wrote, \\"The Need for Speed, Electronic Arts' incredibly fast and enthralling driving game, almost caught the checkered flag. Multiple courses with distinctive feels, brilliant SVGA graphics, and some of the hottest iron on the road made this 3DO conversion a worthy entry into the PC action game arena.\\"\\" ==Notes and references== Footnotes Citations ==External links== * Category:1994 video games Category:3DO Interactive Multiplayer games Category:Cancelled Atari Jaguar games Category:DOS games Category:Electronic Arts games * 01 Category:PlayStation (console) games Category:Sega Saturn games Category:Video games developed in Canada Category:Video games scored by Jeff van Dyck Category:Video games with digitized sprites Category:Windows games ","title":"The Need for Speed"},{"id":"5602218","text":"R√∂thenbach an der Pegnitz is a town in the district of N√ºrnberger Land, in Bavaria, Germany.

It was one of the most popular music forms for decades in Finland. Brought to Europe in the 1910s, and to Finland itself in 1913, by travelling musicians, Finns began to take up the form and write their own tangos in the 1930s.\\"The Story of the Finnish Tango\\" exVirtual FInland by Pekka Gronow, Archived at Wayback Machine, 2008. The first Finnish tango was written by Emil Kauppi in 1914 for a film called Salainen perint√∂m√§√§r√§ys (meaning The Secret Testament). It features a typical Finnish rhythm pattern with habanera. In the 1920s the tango was danced exclusively by Helsinki‚Äôs bohemians. By the 1940s about half of the entries on the popular music charts were occupied by tangos, and the post war period saw tangos spread from a popular urban phenomenon to their enthusiastic adoption by the countryside as well.\\"The Finnish Tango: Its History and Characteristics\\" by Jutta Jaakkola, Finnish Music Information Service, trans. Susan Sinisalo, May, 2000, retrieved July 10, 2014. Finnish tango peaked in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Special characteristics of Finnish tango include the change of rhythm to beguine during chorus. Also habanera rhythm is used often. The bandoneon was replaced by the accordion and drums were added. The Finnish tango is distinguished from other forms of tango by its almost exclusive performance in minor keys and themes reflecting established conventions in Finnish folklore. As the head of the Finnish National Broadcaster's gramophone library explains, \\"The central themes of Finnish tango lyrics are love, sorrow, nature and the countryside. Many tangos express a longing for the old homestead, or a distant land of happiness. The changing seasons of Finnish nature are frequently used metaphors: the spring breaks the hold of the winter, and flowers appear, creating new expectations. Autumn rains and dark evenings are symbols of crushed hopes.\\"\\"Tango and the Finnish Soul\\" by Pekka Gronow, \\"\\" ExVirtual Finland\\"\\" 2007, Archived at Wayback Machine One of the highlights of Finnish summers is the Tangomarkkinat, or tango festival, held annually since 1985 in the central Finnish town of Sein√§joki.\\"Tangomarkkinat\\" , January, 2006, retrieved June 17, 2006. The festival attracts more than 100,000 participants annually (from a population of just over 5 million) and is capped by the coronation of the tango King and Queen, who receive much domestic media attention and often recording contracts as well. Another tango festival is the International Helsinki Frostbite Tango Festival. The city of Tampere hosts the much smaller annual Maailmantango (World of Tango festival). The most well known Finnish tango composers are Olavi Virta (\\"Punatukkaiselle tyt√∂lleni\\"), Toivo K√§rki (\\"Liljankukka\\") and Unto Mononen (\\"Satumaa\\"). ==Tango, the dance== Tango was first performed in Finland by Finns in 1913https://musicfinland.com/en/news/100-years-of-tango- in-finland. Since then tango has evolved in Finland to a distinctive form. Finnish tango as a dance has characteristics that differ from both competitive and Argentine tango. There is a close contact in the pelvis, upper thighs, and the upper body. Finnish tango is often taught with a SSQQ (slow, slow, quick, quick) basic step sequence, with QQS or SQQ used for the beguine or habanera parts so often found in Finnish tango pieces, although a skilled dancer might use slows and quicks just as he wishes to match either the melody or the rhythm. Dips and rotations are frequent. There are no kicks or aerials in Finnish tango. Typically feet stay close to the floor, except in dips the follower might slightly raise the left leg. Steps forward are mainly heel- leads. Only if a forward step is taken during a fall (descending from a rise), the ball touches the floor first. When moving backwards, the heel pushes off the floor. The step sequence may be executed either by closing the last quick step or by letting feet pass each other. The dance is horizontal with optional rises and falls; steps are low and to allow this, the dance position is low with the supporting leg bent. The passing leg moves quickly to rest for a moment close to the grounded leg. Compared to Argentine tango, Finnish tango is more related to (slow) foxtrot, but the feel is different because the weight shift happens close to the end of the beat and the pushing foot will accelerate only to pause next to the grounded one before it moves forward to a long step that is made even longer by pushing off the other leg in the end. Finnish tango requires a lot of space. The Tangomarkkinat festival also hosts dancing competitions, among them Finnish tango. Non-Finnish contestants also participate. ==References== Category:Finnish music Category:Music scenes Category:Tango dance fi:Tango#Suomalainen tango ","title":"Finnish tango"},{"id":"5602242","text":"The Tannehill Ironworks is the central feature of Tannehill Ironworks Historical State Park near the unincorporated town of McCalla in Tuscaloosa County, Alabama. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places as Tannehill Furnace, it was a major supplier of iron for Confederate ordnance. Remains of the old furnaces are located south of Bessemer off Interstate 59/Interstate 20 near the southern end of the Appalachian Mountains. The park includes: the John Wesley Hall Grist Mill; the May Plantation Cotton Gin House; and the Iron & Steel Museum of Alabama. ==History== John Wesley Hall Grist Mill Ironmaking at the site began with construction of a bloomery forge by Daniel Hillman Sr. in 1830. Built by noted southern ironmaster Moses Stroup from 1859 to 1862, the three charcoal blast furnaces at Tannehill could produce 22 tons of pig iron a day, most of which was shipped to the Naval Gun Works and Arsenal at Selma. Furnaces Nos. 2 and 3 were equipped with hot blast stoves and a steam engine. Brown iron ore mines were present two miles (3 km) distant. The Tannehill furnaces and its adjacent foundry, where kettles and hollow-ware were cast for southern troops, were attacked and burnt by three companies of the U.S. 8th Iowa Cavalry on March 31, 1865 during Wilson's Raid. The ruins remain today as one of the best preserved 19th-century iron furnace sites in the South. Also known as the Roupes Valley Iron Company, these works had significant influence on the later development of the Birmingham iron and steel industry. An experiment conducted at Tannehill in 1862 proved red iron ore could successfully be used in Alabama blast furnaces. The test, promoted by South & North Railroad developers, led to the location of government- financed ironworks in the immediate Birmingham area (Jefferson County). ;Listings The furnace remains and its reconstructed portions were named an American Society for Metals historical landmark in 1994. The park is a designated Civil War Discovery Trail site, a stop on the Alabama Appalachian Highlands Birding Trail, and was listed among the top 10 Alabama parks and nature areas visited in 2016. ==See also== *Brierfield Furnace *Shelby Ironworks ==ReferencesExternal links== * Tannehill Ironworks Historical State Park Alabama Historic Ironworks Commission * * Category:Industrial buildings completed in 1862 Category:State parks of Alabama Category:Ironworks and steel mills in Alabama Category:National Register of Historic Places in Tuscaloosa County, Alabama Category:Alabama in the American Civil War Category:Protected areas of Tuscaloosa County, Alabama Category:Mountain biking venues in Alabama Category:Museums in Tuscaloosa County, Alabama Category:Wilson's Raid Category:Industry museums in Alabama Category:History museums in Alabama Category:Industrial buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in Alabama Category:Blast furnaces in the United States Category:1862 establishments in Alabama Category:Historic American Buildings Survey in Alabama Category:Historic American Engineering Record in Alabama Category:American Civil War on the National Register of Historic Places ","title":"Tannehill Ironworks"},{"id":"5602248","text":"California's 22nd congressional district is a congressional district in the U.S. state of California.

The wetlands have large numbers of birds, crustaceans, small mammals and fish. ==Overview== Ras Al Khor Wildlife Sanctuary represents an enclave of relative wilderness amidst traffic and sprawling urban infrastructure. Located just as the name in Arabic suggests ‚Äì at the Cape of the Creek, it is among the few urban protected areas of the world. The Dubai Municipality has taken great efforts to protect and preserve the biodiversity of this delicate ecosystem. The wetland has been fenced off from the public and three birding hides have been built. The bird hides are a first step towards the development of more elaborate visitor education facilities in the protected area. The WWF UAE Project Office collaborated with Dubai Municipality's Environment Department, in setting up the facilities that were sponsored by the National Bank of Dubai. Opportunities for experiencing a natural environment in this rapidly building-up emirate are so limited that the opening of Ras Al Khor to visitors is a boon to present and potential nature lovers. Presently there are three birding hides located on the perimeter of the sanctuary open to the public. Entrance is free and operate from 9:00 am to 4:00 pm Saturday to Thursday. Ras Al Khor is also home to about 500 greater flamingoes (Phoenicopterus roseus), which has become something of a mascot for Dubai's Wild Life protection program. ==Species== Greater Flamingo Some of the regular visitors to the sanctuary are: * Asian pied myna * Black-winged stilt * Blue-cheeked bee-eater * Caspian tern * Citrine wagtail * Common greenshank * Common hoopoe * Common kingfisher * Common sandpiper * Common snipe * Cormorant * Curlew * Dunlin * Eurasian marsh harrier * Great black backed gull * Great egret * Greater flamingo * Grey francolin * Grey heron * Grey plover * Indian peafowl * Indian roller * Indian silverbill * Isabelline shrike * Little bittern * Little green bee-eater * Malabar lark * Mallard * Osprey * Pied avocet * Purple sunbird * Red-vented bulbul * Red-wattled lapwing * Ringed plover * Ruddy turnstone * Sanderling * Snowy plover * Spotted eagle * Terek sandpiper * Western heron * White wagtail * White-eared bulbul * Yellow billed stork ==Gallery== File:A view from Rasal khore wildlife sanctuary.JPG File:Flemingos from Rasal khore wildlife sanctuary.JPG File:Ras-al khore wildlife sanctuary-4.JPG ==See also== * Al Marmoom Desert Conservation Reserve, Dubai * Al-Wathba Wetland Reserve, Abu Dhabi * Dubai Desert Conservation Reserve * Jebel Hafeet National Park, Abu Dhabi * Mangrove National Park, Abu Dhabi * Sir Abu Nu'ayr, Sharjah * Sir Bani Yas, Abu Dhabi * Wadi Wurayah, Fujairah * Wildlife of the United Arab Emirates ==ReferencesExternal links== * Official website * Government information Category:Year of establishment missing Category:Communities in Dubai Category:Ramsar sites in the United Arab Emirates Category:Wildlife sanctuaries of the United Arab Emirates ","title":"Ras Al Khor"},{"id":"5602345","text":"{ class=\\"infobox\\" style=\\"width: 25em; font-size: %;\\" - colspan=\\"3\\" bgcolor=\\"#FF0000\\"  center; font-size: larger;\\"  21 √Ångeles - colspan=2 { width=100% style=\\"background: #f9f9f9;\\" - style=\\"vertical- align: center; text-align: center;\\" width=40%Suba TV.91 width=20%‚óÑ ‚ñ∫ width=40%Gratamira } - Location Avenida Suba with Transversal 84 - Neighborhood Suba - style=\\"vertical-align: center;\\" Opened April 29, 2006 - style=\\"vertical-align: top; text-align: center;\\" } The simple station 21 √Ångeles is part of the TransMilenio mass-transit system of Bogot√°, Colombia, which opened in the year 2000. ==Location== The station is located in northwestern Bogot√°, specifically on Avenida Suba with Transversal 84.

Aleksandra's father was a townsman, and her mother came from the nobility, but both their families were relatively poor. Aleksandra's parents died when she was ten years old, and the orphan was raised by her grandmother, Karolina Zahorska, n√©e Truskolaska and her aunt, Wiktoria Maria Zahorska. She attended gymnasium, the equivalent of high school, in Suwa≈Çki, graduating in 1901, and soon began her studies at the Flying University. In 1903 she began working in the office of the Homa leather factory, located in the Wola district of Warsaw. In 1904 she joined the Polish Socialist Party (PPS), one of the two main revolutionary and political movements in partitioned Poland, the other being National Democracy. She was soon acting as a PPS agitator in the Warsaw suburb of Praga, taking part in a demonstration held on Plac Grzybowski on 13 November 1904. She also joined the military arm of the PPS, Organizacja Bojowa, where she became a courier and stockpiler of weapons. It became necessary for her to resign from her job at the factory, and she tutored students to supplement her income. In May 1906 she met J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski. That year the PPS split into two factions, supporters and opponents of Pi≈Çsudski. She remained with the Pi≈Çsudski faction. Aleksandra was arrested in 1907 and imprisoned for three weeks in Dani≈Ç≈Çowicze prison, then transferred to the Pawiak prison, where she was eventually released due to insufficient evidence. She moved to Radzymin and later to Kiev, and at that time fell in love with Pi≈Çsudski. (He was then unhappily married to Maria Juszkiewiczowa z Koplewskich). In 1908, she took part in the Bezdany raid, where Pi≈Çsudski and several fellow revolutionaries robbed a Russian mail train. She was crucial in helping to organize the raid, acting as a lookout, and preparing maps and plans for weeks before the robbery. Afterwards, she moved to Lw√≥w, and once again became an office worker in a factory. Soon she became involved with the new organization formed by Pi≈Çsudski, The Union of Riflemen, ZwiƒÖzek Strzelecki, and from 1912, she was an important activist in the women's section of the ZS. She was a librarian in yet another one of Pi≈Çsudski's organizations, the Union of Active Fighters, ZwiƒÖzek Walki Czynnej, and a cofounder of the Society for the Welfare of Political Prisoners (Towarzystwo Opieki nad Wiƒôzniami Politycznymi). During the First World War, she worked in the intelligence and communication section of the First Brigade of the Polish Legions, and soon she became involved with the Polish Military Organisation (Polska Organizacja Wojskowa). As a result of these activities, she was arrested in 1915 by the Germans in Warsaw, and again imprisoned in Pawiak in November of that year. Found guilty, she was imprisoned in Szczypiorno and Lauban in Silesia. She was released after the Act of November 5, 1916, which proclaimed the creation of the Kingdom of Poland, a puppet state, allied and expected to work with, and controlled by, the Central Powers. She then returned to Warsaw, and resumed her work in the organization called the Women's League (Liga Kobiet). She identified as a feminist and wrote: > Pi≈Çsudski already promised that if he started to organize the army he would > not forget about women‚Äôs unit. The feminist movement was very popular in > Europe in this time. In England suffragists chained themselves to bars on > the streets and torched castles while fighting for women‚Äôs rights. Feminists > were also popular in France and other countries. Only socialists claimed > that women should have equal rights with men. In February 1918, Aleksandra had a daughter, Wanda, and in February 1920, a second daughter, Jadwiga. Their father was J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski. Pi≈Çsudski and Aleksandra could not get married as Pi≈Çsudski's wife Maria refused to divorce him. It was only after Maria's death in 1921 that they were married, on October 25 of the same year. After Pi≈Çsudski's May Coup in 1926, Aleksandra became a patron and a leader of the Women's League. She was also a chairwoman of the Military Family's Association (Rodzina Wojskowa), the \\"Osiedle\\" Association, and the Union of Polish Defenders of the Fatherland (Unia Polskich ZwiƒÖzk√≥w Obro≈Ñczy≈Ñ Ojczyzny). She was also active in the affairs of the Association for the Care of Homeless Children (Towarzystwo Opieki nad Bezdomnymi Dzieƒámi). Her marriage to Pi≈Çsudski became stormy in later years, with Pi≈Çsudski living apart from her for long periods of time, in various governmental residences. Josef Pilsudski died in May 1935. After the German invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939 she fled with her daughters via Lithuania, Latvia and Sweden to the United Kingdom. There she wrote her memoirs, and lived in London until her death. She is buried at the North Sheen Cemetery. One of her daughters, Jadwiga, a pilot, served with distinction in the Air Transport Auxiliary during the Second World War. == References == * Aleksandra Pi≈Çsudska, last accessed on June 16, 2006 == Further reading == * Aleksandra Pi≈Çsudska, Memoires of Madame Pilsudski, London, Hurst and Blackett, 1940; * Aleksandra Pi≈Çsudska, Pilsudski: a Biography by His Wife, Dodd, Mead and Co., New York, 1941.

C. Wyeth, 1917 Robin Hood's Death is the 120th ballad of the Child ballads collection published by Houghton Mifflin. The fragmentary Percy Folio version of it appears to be one of the oldest existing tales of Robin Hood; there is a synopsis of the story in the fifteenth century A Gest of Robyn Hode.Holt, J. C. Robin Hood p. 25 (1982) Thames & Hudson. bowshot. ==Synopsis== In the fragmentary Percy Folio version Robin Hood goes to get himself bled (a common medieval medical practice) by his cousin, a prioress. He refuses a bodyguard that Will Scarlet offers and takes only Little John with him. The prioress treacherously lets out too much blood, killing him, or her lover Sir Roger of Doncaster stabs him while he's weak, in revenge for Robin's family having inherited his land and title. Robin Hood claims some consolation, though, in that he mortally wounds Roger prior to his own demise. Little John wishes to avenge him, but Robin forbids it, because he has never harmed a woman. An old woman appears early on the journey, \\"banning\\" Robin Hood. The manuscript breaks off for half a page, with outlaws asking why she is doing so. \\"Banning\\" is usually taken as \\"cursing\\" him, but may mean \\"lamenting\\"‚Äîpredicting his death and weeping in advance. In the next surviving fragment, Robin Hood appears to be reassuring someone who has warned him he is going to his death. The later broadside version of this ballad omits the mysterious people (or person) Robin Hood meets on his way, and Sir Roger of Doncaster, but adds the detail that Robin Hood shoots one final arrow and asks to be buried where it falls. The broadside is first recorded around the time that the Percy Folio version was first published, in the mid-eighteenth century. This is now the most common account of Robin Hood's death. See Robin Hood and the Valiant Knight for a different version that commonly appeared in the Robin Hood \\"garlands\\" or collections, and also in A True Tale of Robin Hood. This version inspired the film Robin and Marian, in which it is Robin's lover, Maid Marian, now a nun, who is his downfall, poisoning Robin and then herself when he suffers serious wounds in his final battle with the Sheriff of Nottingham, Marian wanting to spare him the personal anguish of living while incapable of being what he once was. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Robin Hood's Death * Discussion *The Death of Robin Hood: Introduction Category:Child Ballads Category:Robin Hood ballads Category:Houghton Mifflin books ","title":"Robin Hood's Death"},{"id":"5602398","text":"Erythrosuchus (red crocodile) is an extinct genus of archosauriform reptile from the Triassic of South Africa. Remains have been found from the Cynognathus Assemblage Zone of the Beaufort Group in the Karoo of South Africa. In the Late Triassic, the ecological niche left by Erythrosuchus was filled by creatures like Saurosuchus and Postosuchus. ==Description== Digital reconstruction of Erythrosuchus africanus. Erythrosuchus was the largest predator of its time, and was around long. It walked on all fours and had limbs which were positioned semi-vertically under its body, unlike the more sprawling gait of most earlier reptiles. Its head was large and dinosaur-like, reaching a length of , and had sharp, conical teeth. Erythrosuchus was the largest erythrosuchid, but apart from its size, it was similar in appearance to other related genera. It had a large head and comparatively short neck. One of the few distinguishing features of Erythrosuchus other than its size is the smoothness of the margin of the squamosal, a bone at the rear of the skull. In other erythrosuchids, the margin of this bone projects backward from the skull, giving it a hook-like appearance. In Erythrosuchus, the margin is convex and lacks a hook. ==Discovery== Fossils, 1 and 3 Erythrosuchus is known from many specimens, most of which are fragmentary. The holotype, described by Robert Broom in 1905 and known as SAM 905, is poorly preserved. Only small pieces of the limbs, pectoral and pelvic girdles, skull, and a few vertebrae present in this specimen. A thorough description of the genus was given by German paleontologist Friedrich von Huene in 1911. The fossil material that served as the basis for the description is now housed in the Natural History Museum in London, England. Like the holotype, it is very fragmentary, and some specimens may even belong to the same individual as SAM 905. One specimen, known as BMNH R 3592, is relatively more complete, with much of the postcranial skeleton intact. Parts of vertebrae Early restorations of the skull of Erythrosuchus depicted it as being tall, similar in appearance to Tyrannosaurus. However, a complete skull that was later described in 1963 revealed that the true shape was less tall than previously thought. This skull, known as BPI 5207 and currently part of the collection of the Bernard Price Institute for Palaeontological Research in South Africa, has a somewhat pointed snout. Earlier restorations may have shown a deeper snout because it was not known at the time how the bones of the skull articulated with one another. The braincase has also been studied, and possesses features that are shared with other early archosauriforms. Many of these characteristics are considered plesiomorphic, or ancestral, in archosaurs. While Erythrosuchus is not considered an archosaur, it is thought to be closely related to the last common ancestor of all archosaurs. ==Classification== Restoration The hypothetical last common ancestor of archosaurs is thought to have shared many features with Erythrosuchus, many of which are found in the braincase. For example, the inner part of the otic capsule (the skeletal structure surrounding the inner ear) is not entirely ossified, or completely formed of bone. Neither is the channel for the perilymphatic duct, which is a tube that leaves the lagena. The lagena is the portion of the inner ear responsible for hearing, and is known as the cochlea in mammals (although in mammals it is coiled rather than straight). Erythrosuchus has a short lagena, which is also expected in the last common ancestor of all archosaurs. Some features of the ankle of Erythrosuchus suggest that it was beginning to adapt toward digitigrady, or walking on toes rather than having the entire foot placed on the ground. The ankle is similar to that of Euparkeria; the ankles of both of these animals are more advanced than those of other archosauriformes. == References == Category:Erythrosuchids Category:Triassic archosauriforms Category:Triassic reptiles of Africa Category:Triassic South Africa Category:Fossils of South Africa Category:Fossils of Namibia Category:Omingonde Formation Category:Fossil taxa described in 1905 Category:Taxa named by Robert Broom ","title":"Erythrosuchus"},{"id":"5602405","text":"The Raiffeisen Bank is the largest bank in Albania, with more than 60% of all retail deposits and the largest branch network. ==Background== It was originally known as Banka e Kursimeve (Savings Bank of Albania), but following its acquisition by Raiffeisen Zentralbank (RZB) during 2004 it was rebranded as Raiffeisen Bank.

The ships of this class have had successive improvements after their completion, especially to their C4I systems. These air-defense warships are the natural successor to the first generation air-defense ship, the , and they were in turn, followed by newer air-defense ships, the . The Tachikaze class was equipped with the Tartar-D system as the key weapon system, the fleet-area air defense weapon system with the Standard-1 MR missile. At the same time, this was the American first native integrated weapon system with the Naval Tactical Data System (NTDS), so this class was the first of the Maritime Self Defense Force's ships that utilised computers widely. As the NTDS, OYQ-1 Weapon Entry System (WES) was on board on the lead ship, Tachikaze. The OYQ-1 WES was based on the technology of the NYYA-1 which was on board on the lead ship of the , and this system was the first Japanese shipboard C4I system with the architecture of NTDS. On the second ship, Asakaze, the improved OYQ-2 Target Designation System (TDS) was on board. And the third ship, Sawakaze, introduced the new-generation combat direction system, OYQ-4. The Tachikaze-class destroyers' weapon systems include one Mk 13 missile launcher for the Standard-1 MR surface-to-air missile, one Type 74 octuple launcher (Japanese version of the American Mark 16 GMLS) for the ASROC anti-submarine rockets, eight Boeing Harpoon anti-ship missile, two 20-mm Phalanx CIWS gun mounts, two Type 68 (Model HOS-301) triple torpedo tubes, and two 5-inch/54 caliber Mark 42 rapid-fire guns. In 1998, Tachikaze was converted to be the flagship of the Fleet Escort Force. The aft 5-inch gun was replaced with a fleet command area. Tachikaze was decommissioned in 2007. Sawakaze then succeeded her in the flagship role. The ships of the Tachikaze class were decommissioned beginning in 2007. All three vessels of the Tachikaze class were named after destroyers of the Imperial Japanese Navy, with Tachikaze and Asakaze being lost to enemy action during the war.

He was both Olympic and World champion. ==Olympic games== At the 1936 Winter Olympics, Hagen won one gold in the Nordic combined and two silvers in cross-country skiing. The cross-country relay event saw its first Olympic appearance in 1936. Hagen had the first leg, and finished his leg one minute ahead of Finland's Sulo Nurmela, with Sweden's John Berger fifteen seconds further behind. Kalle Jalkanen on the final leg secured Finland the relay victory, six seconds before the Norwegian team. The 18 kilometre cross-country skiing race was also the first part of the Nordic combined. Hagen finished second in the 18 km, behind Sweden's Erik August Larsson, earning him a silver medal. After the ski jumping the next day, he secured the gold medal in the combined. ==World Championships== At the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships, Hagen won golds in the individual Nordic combined (1934, 1935) and silvers in the men's 4 √ó 10 km relay and the men's 18 km (both 1935). Hagen's consecutive world championships in Nordic combined would not be repeated until fellow Norwegian Bjarte Engen Vik won the event in 1999 and 2001. In the 4 √ó 10 km relay in Sollefte√• in 1934, Hagen had the final leg, and while battling with Sweden's Arthur H√§ggblad for the silver medal they both got off course and lost ten minutes. The two were passed by Germany, and Hagen finished fourth behind the Swedish team. ==Holmenkollen== At the Holmenkollen ski festival, Hagen won the Nordic combined event three times (1932, 1934, and 1935). For his Nordic combined successes at the Olympics, Holmenkollen, and World Championships, Hagen earned the Holmenkollen medal in 1934. Hagen hailed from Ytre Rendal, and competed for B√¶kkelagets SK in Oslo. He received the King's Cup five times. His strongest discipline was cross-country skiing, while his results in ski jumping were steady, but not outstanding. Most of his life he worked as a workshop manager in Oslo. ==Cross-country skiing results== All results are sourced from the International Ski Federation (FIS).

It is said to live in a cavern beneath Hastingues, a town in the Les Landes region in southwestern France.Carol Rose, Giants, Monsters, and Dragons: An Encyclopedia of Folklore, Legend, and Myth, ABC-CLIO, Inc., Santa Barbara, California, 2000, 229, https://archive.org/details/giantsmonstersdr0000rose/page/228. The carcolh's slime could sometimes be seen long before the creature itself arrived. Nobody dared to approach the creature, as unwary persons would be grabbed by its tentacles, dragged into its cave and devoured whole. The Carcolh is a nickname given to the city of Hastingues, in the French department of Landes, due to its situation on a rounded-shape hill.

He graduated with a Master of Arts degree in 1888 and pursued graduate study at the University of Halle, Sorbonne, and the University of Leipzig. Elected president of Richmond College in 1895 at the age of twenty-seven, Boatwright led the university for 51 years, one of the longest terms of service of any college president. In 1914, under Dr. Boatwright's leadership, the College moved from the Fan district of downtown Richmond to its current West End campus. Boatwright Memorial Library, opened in 1955 on the school's campus, is named in his honor. Earl Hamner Jr., creator of the hit CBS-TV series The Waltons, attended Richmond College during Boatwright's tenure, and named the fictional Boatwright University where the character of John-Boy Walton attended college after him. ==External links== *History of the University of Richmond: People: Frederic William Boatwright *Frederic William Boatwright - A History *A look back: Boatwright Library turns 50 - Category:1868 births Category:University of Richmond alumni Category:University of Paris alumni Category:University of Halle alumni Category:Leipzig University alumni Category:Presidents of the University of Richmond Category:1951 deaths Category:People from White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia Category:American expatriates in France ","title":"Frederic W.

These scutes were sometimes considered to have been staggered, alternating between several rows. However, some studies refute this claim, instead purporting that the scutes were aligned in neat rows, with a one-to- one assignment of scutes to vertebrae. The structure of the hips shows that its legs were placed under the body almost vertically. Coupled with the development of a calcaneus and a specialized ankle joint, this would have made Ticinosuchus a fast runner, unlike most earlier reptiles. Ticinosuchus is thought to be very close to or possible even the same species that made the Cheirotherium trace fossils found in Germany. It too shows a narrow track-way, similar to that of Ticinosuchus. It is one of the most famous fossils of Besano. The broken skull of the holotype Fish scales have been preserved in the abdomen of the specimen. This was likely indicative of a piscivorous diet. Ticinosuchus shares many similarities with paracrocodylomorphs, such as certain adaptations of the ischium and possibly (but not certainly) hyposphene-hypantrum articulations. ==References== * Krebs, B.

In the wild, frogs may go through their whole life cycle in a bromeliad. This genus is closely related to Guzmania. Both Guzmania and Vriesea have dry capsules that split open to release parachute like seeds similar to the Dandelion (Taraxacum sp.). Most Vriesea are epiphytes and grow soil-less on trees. they have no roots but have special hold fasts that do not take in any nutrients.

It lived during the Late Triassic period, and was about 3 to 8 meters in length. Rutiodon is known from the eastern United States (North Carolina, New York, New Jersey). ==Description== Fossil of R. carolinensis Restoration of R. carolinensis Like other phytosaurs, Rutiodon strongly resembled a crocodile, but its nostrils were positioned far back on the head, close to the eyes, instead of at the tip of the snout. It had enlarged front teeth, and a relatively narrow jaw, somewhat resembling that of a modern gharial. This suggests that this carnivore probably caught fish and it may also have snatched land animals from the waterside. Also, like modern crocodiles, its back, flanks, and tail were covered with bony armored plates. Rutiodon was among the largest carnivorous animals of its environment, measuring 3‚Äì8 meters (10‚Äì26 ft) in length. ==Species== The holotype of R. manhattanensis on display in the American Museum of Natural History Skeleton of R. carolinensis viewed from the front The type species of Rutiodon is R. carolinensis.

Viceroy Juan Ruiz de Apodaca, Novella's predecessor, converted it into a storehouse for arms and munitions, but these were slowly being pilfered. He ordered Brigadier Francisco Novella to take charge of La Ciudadela and stop the thievery. Novella considered that task beneath his dignity, and was able to enlist the support of the Audiencia of Mexico. The incident made Novella an enemy of Ruiz de Apodaca. After the Plan de Iguala united the insurgents and many of the royalist troops in New Spain, the remaining royalists, led by Brigadier Buceli, declared Viceroy Ruiz de Apodaca inept and deposed him (July 5, 1821). He was sent to Spain to face charges, but there he was absolved and returned to duty. General Francisco Novella was made interim viceroy until the arrival of Ruiz de Apodaca's replacement, Juan O'Donoj√∫, a short time later. Novella served for just over two weeks. His appointment was irregular, and had not originated in Spain. His name appears in some lists of viceroys of New Spain, but not in all. ==References== * Garc√≠a Puron, Manuel, M√©xico y sus gobernantes, v. 1.

Magdalena was betrothed to Ladislaus the Posthumous however he died suddenly in Prague on 23 November 1457 while preparing for his marriage. It was rumored at the time that his political opponents in Bohemia had poisoned him; but in the 20th century it was proved that Ladislaus died of leukemia, not a recognized disease in that period. She married Gaston, Prince of Viana, son and heir of Gaston IV, Count of Foix and Eleanor of Navarre, at Saint-Jean-d'Ang√©ly in 1461. They had two children: *Francis Phoebus (1466‚Äì1483), King of Navarre *Catherine (1470‚Äì1517), queen regnant of Navarre, married in 1484 John of Albret (1469‚Äì1516). Her husband died in 1470, predeceasing his father; accordingly, when Gaston IV died in 1472, his possessions were inherited by Magdalena's son, Francis Phoebus. Francis became the heir of Navarre in 1479 upon the death of his great-grandfather, John II of Aragon and Navarre, who left Navarre to the rightful heir, Magdalena's mother-in-law, Eleanor. Eleanor only spent a few weeks as queen before she herself died; Francis Phoebus became king, and his mother acted as regent until his death, at age 17, in 1483; Magdalena then acted as regent for her daughter, Catherine, until 1494. During this regency, she was forced to battle her brother-in-law, John of Foix, who claimed the throne of Navarre as heir male of Francis Phoebus. Magdalena was taken hostage by Ferdinand II of Aragon in 1494. She died in the following year; her death provoked fresh conflict. With the death of Charles VIII of France (Magdalena's nephew), the descendants of Charles VI of France ceased to occupy the French throne. By the death of Anne of France, Magdalena's niece, along with that of her elder sister Yolande, Duchess of Savoy, became the last surviving legitimate descents from Charles VII of France. Her descendant and heir, Henry III of Navarre, would become King of France in 1589, returning the descent and heirs of Charles VI and Charles VII to the French throne. ==AncestryReferences== Category:1443 births Category:1495 deaths Category:People from Tours, France Category:House of Valois Category:Regents of France Category:15th-century women rulers Category:15th-century viceregal rulers Category:Princesses of Viana Category:Burials at Pamplona Cathedral Category:15th-century French people Category:15th-century French women Category:Daughters of kings ","title":"Magdalena of Valois"},{"id":"5602582","text":"Jeff Peterson (born January 24, 1978) is an American actor.

It is termed as culturo-ideological exclusivism by some when one's cultural values and norms are absolutised in such a manner that a particular way of life is enshrined as superior to all others and must therefore be adopted by others (e.g. the Tamil reaction to the perceived \\"Sinhalisation\\" processes of the Sri Lankan state) It was said to be a cause of the abortive coup by disgruntled Catholic army officers in 1962. Currently some observers note that Sri Lankan political parties such as JHU and JVP adhere to a policy of political Sinhalisation. ==Other meanings== Medias use the word \\"Sinhalisation\\" to refer to the process by which the Sri Lankan government funded and sponsored settlement of Sinhala people in Tamil- dominant regions in order to make Tamil as minorities. Some reports claims that the Sinhalese and Sinhala military families are settled in houses built by money from the Indian government that was intended to improve the welfare of the Tamil people. ==Notes== The ancestor of the Bandaranayke family was a 17th-century Tamil immigrant Pandaram; a non-Brahmin priest known as Neelaperumal Kalukapuge. The term 'Kalu' in Tamil is different in meaning to the Sinhalese meaning. A similar process was witnessed in the Kandyan kingdom, where for example the ancestor of Pilimatalavuva Maha Adikaram and related families trace or claim ancestry from a Pandyan emperor of the late 17th century,Pilimatalavuva Family by Ananda Pilimatalavuva, 05-08-2019 though the Pandyan kingdom had seized to exist by the 15th century and the region was ruled by the Madurai Sultanate, the Vijayanagara Empire and the Nayak dynasties. ==See also== *Sri Lankan Mudaliyars *Bharatakula *Demalagattara *Negombo Tamils *Kandyan Convention ==ReferencesExternal links== *Sinhalization of the Vanni Mainland *Colombo Telegraph *Sinhalisation of a coastal village in Puttalam district *Sinhalisation of the Vedda community *Kandya Convention signatories Category:Cultural assimilation Category:Sri Lankan Tamil culture Category:British Ceylon period Category:Political history of Sri Lanka ","title":"Sinhalisation"},{"id":"5602597","text":"From the level crossing Eastrington railway station serves the village of Eastrington in the East Riding of Yorkshire, England.

Typically working under the pseudonym Charles Lloyd, Birkin's tales tended towards the conte cruels rather than supernatural fiction. ==Quotes regardingBiography== Birkin was the son of Colonel Charles Wilfred Birkin and Claire Howe, the daughter of Alexander Howe. Freda Dudley Ward was a sister. He was educated at Eton College and was later employed by the publisher Philip Allan to anonymously edit the Creeps horror story anthologies, the first which appeared in 1932.Ashley 1977, p. 35. Authors anthologized in the Creeps series included H. Russell Wakefield, Tod Robbins, H. D. Everett and Elliott O'Donnell. Birkin included stories of his own in most of these volumes (under the pseudonym \\"Charles Lloyd\\"), these being later collected as Devil's Spawn (1936). According to E.F. Bleiler, in the Creeps series \\"editorial stress was on fairly low-brow stories of horror and sadism, although stories by H. Russell Wakefield helped to raise the level of individual volumes.\\" E. F. Bleiler, The Guide to Supernatural Fiction. Kent, OH: Kent State University Press, 1983, p. 130. He succeeded his uncle as 5th Baronet Birkin in 1942. During the Second World War he served in the Sherwood Foresters.Burke's Peerage, Baronetage & Knightage (107th edition, 2003) After a long hiatus, Birkin resumed writing in 1960, following a return to London, and two new stories appeared in Dennis Wheatley's anthologies Quiver of Horror (1964) and Shafts of Fear (1964). This was followed by eight collections of original Birkin stories, beginning with The Kiss of Death (1964) and ending with Spawn of Satan (1970). This last volume was published in the US only. Birkin's work is much in the tradition of the conte cruel and the grand guignol. From 1970 to 1974 he lived in Cyprus which he fled after getting caught up in the violence following the Turkish invasion. His short story A Low Profile (1977) reflects his experiences there. He married Australian actress Janet Ramsey Johnson, the daughter of Peter Johnson, and had a two daughters and a son, John Birkin. John Birkin became known as a director of many notable British television comedies including Mr. Bean, French and Saunders, and Harry Enfield's Television Programme.https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0083606/ He and his wife spent their later years in Sulby, Isle of Man. Birkin died in 1985. Birkin's short stories have been estimated as numbering over one hundred. All queries regarding publishing his work should be directed towards his grandson Luke Toyne. ==Bibliography== Short story collections *Devil's Spawn (Philip Allan, 1936).

Released in 2002, it was the sequel to 1993 game 13 Dead End Drive. The story behind the game revolves around the death of Aunt Agatha, a wealthy old woman and heiress to a \\"kitty-litter empire.\\" Sixteen of her closest companions have gathered at her estate for the reading of her will, and to collect their inheritance, they must escape Aunt Agatha's trap-filled mansion before midnight. ==Gameplay== At the start of gameplay, players are passed out \\"Heir Cards\\" which correspond to the pawns that are placed on the board. There are a total of sixteen characters, so it is almost always the case that players control more than one character. Players are required to keep the roles of their Character Cards secret from their opponents. Additionally there are thirty-two \\"Playing Cards,\\" which allow players to do special things during their turn such as spring traps or instantly move pawns to other rooms. There is also one \\"Clock Strikes Midnight\\" card that is placed at the bottom of the Playing Cards, and if this card is drawn by any player, the game ends. During each turn, players roll two dice and move two pawns which correspond to each dice roll. Players are allowed to move any pawn on the board, regardless if they hold its corresponding Heir Card or not, so that they can move it closer to or further away from a trap space or the door. A pawn can be moved onto a Trap space by exact roll only, and when a pawn is moved onto a Trap space, the player must draw a card from the Playing Cards stack. To spring a trap, a player must have a corresponding trap card in their possession. Springing traps is not mandatory, however. There are also Secret Passage spaces that players can use to quickly travel around the mansion. Also during the game, players must pay attention to Aunt Agatha's will, which changes with the death of each character. The will contains the portrait of each character and is organized in a chain-like fashion. Every character begins with a single money bag token, except for Spritzy, who begins with four, and Sedgewick, who begins with two. When a character is \\"knocked off\\", their money tokens go to the next character in line of the will. When the last surviving character of the will is knocked off, their money tokens go to the \\"Pet Pals Retirement Home\\", and no one receives the money. If a character escapes the mansion, their money bag tokens are removed from the will and their space on the will is skipped over if a character preceding them on the will is knocked off. Ways to Win The winner of the game is determined by the amount of money bag tokens each player has at the end of the game. Whoever has the most money bag tokens when every player is out of the mansion (either by death or by escape) is the winner of the game. If the bottom of the Playing Cards stack is reached and the \\"Clock Strikes Midnight\\" card is drawn, gameplay ends instantly and players must count the moneybags currently in their possession to determine the winner. Traps 1313 Dead End Drive has five different booby traps that can be sprung throughout the mansion. *The Stair Trap is located in the Art Room, and a lever can be pushed down on the top step to make the pawn on the trap fall off the stairway. *The Fireplace Trap is in the Grand Room, and an urn can be rotated to move the pawn on the trap around to the back of the fireplace. *The Boar's Head Trap is in the Trophy Room, and a lever can be lifted from the back of the wall to release the Boar's Head to drop it on the pawn under it. *The Suit of Armor Trap is in the Parlor Room, a lever can be pushed on the statue to make the suit of armor topple over onto the pawn. *The Safe Trap is in the Vault Room, and a lever can be pushed to make a piggybank hidden inside the safe shoot down the chute and strike the pawn. Any player can move any pawn onto a Trap Space, but it must be by exact roll. To spring the trap to knock off the pawn, a player must use a corresponding Trap Card, which can be drawn from the Playing Cards stack. When a trap is sprung on a character, their pawn and Heir Card are placed on the table to signify that they are no longer in play. Additionally, any money bags that are on their space in the will or moved to the next heir in line. Characters Aunt Agatha: A \\"filthy-rich heiress to a kitty-litter empire\\" whose estate the heirs are competing for. The Heirs (In the order that they appear on the will): *Spritzy: Agatha's hair stylist; cut her hair for fifteen years *Sedgwick: Agatha's nephew; a mad scientist who needs Agatha's money to continue his research in curing bald eagles *Dusty: Agatha's maid *Parker: Agatha's chauffeur; Agatha annoyed her with backseat driving tips *Prudence: Agatha's accountant; a former ambulance chaser *Lulu: Agatha's sister; gossiped with Agatha for an occasional \\"loan\\" from her *Sassy: An aspiring rock star; used Agatha's money to try to skyrocket her career *Madame Astra: Agatha's fortune teller *Pierre: Agatha's cook *Smothers: Agatha's butler; served Agatha for thirty years *Charity: Agatha's personal physician *Clay: Resident tennis professional *Perkins: Hunter; kept Agatha's Wild Game Preserve *Pugsley: Agatha's dog *Beauregard III: Agatha's lover *Poopsie: Agatha's cat Playing Cards There are five different kinds of Playing Cards: *Room card: This card allows a player to move any pawn from any space and move it to any unoccupied space in the room shown on the card, including a Trap space. *Take a New Heir card: This card allows a player to take one Heir card from any opponent's hand. The player can choose any opponent to take an Heir card from, and they pick one at random. *Run for it! card: This card allows a player to move any pawn of their choice the number rolled on the die. These cards can help players move pawns away or off of Trap spaces, help a pawn escape, or even prevent a pawn from escaping. *Trap card: This card allows players to spring one of the two traps that are displayed on the card. *Wild Trap card: This card allows a player to spring any trap. Players can play as many Trap cards as they wish on a single turn; additionally or instead, they can play one of any other card. Playing Cards must be played after a player rolls their two dice. Special Spaces and Rules *Rolling Doubles: If a player rolls doubles, they have a choice of moving one pawn the sum of their die roll, or continuing play as normal, you do not get to roll again. *Secret Passages: There are several secret passage spaces located across the mansion. Going through a secret passage counts as one space move, and players are not limited to which secret passage they move to. *Bluffing: Bluffing is allowed and encouraged in 1313 Dead End Drive. You can move your opponents' pawns towards the Front Door or even move your own pawns onto Trap spaces in order to fool your opponents. Since Playing Cards can be kept secret from opponents and since Trap cards do not have to be played when they are drawn, this allows for more variety and safer bluffing. *The \\"Retrap\\" move: It is possible for a player to move a pawn off of a Trap space and back onto it in a single turn in order to draw a Playing Card. ==13 Dead End Drive== 13 Dead End Drive is the predecessor to 1313 Dead End Drive. Many of the aspects of the first game were passed on to the second, but there are several alterations: in 13 Dead End Drive, Aunt Agatha's Will is replaced by a \\"Portrait\\", which hangs over the fireplace and displays the portrait of any of the twelve (instead of sixteen) heirs. If an heir escapes while they are displayed in the portrait, they win the game. Instead of the \\"Clock Strikes Midnight\\" card, there are thirteen \\"Detective Cards\\" scattered throughout the Trap card pile. When a Detective card is drawn, a Detective pawn, which is waiting outside of the mansion, moves one space closer to the mansion. The game can end instantly if the thirteenth Detective card is drawn and the Detective pawn reaches the front door. Additionally, the Boar's Head trap is replaced by a Chandelier, and the Safe trap is replaced by a Bookshelf. Also, one of the characters from the original game, Hickory, the gardener, does not appear in this one. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:Board game sequels Category:Board games introduced in 2002 Category:Parker Brothers games Category:Murder and mystery board games ","title":"1313 Dead End Drive"},{"id":"5602645","text":"Pyramidellinae is a taxonomic subfamily of minute sea snails, marine gastropod mollusks in the family Pyramidellidae, the pyrams and their allies. == Taxonomy == It is one of eleven recognised subfamilies of the marine gastropod family Pyramidellidae (according to the taxonomy of Ponder & Lindberg, 1997), which are as follows: Odostomiinae, Turbonillinae, Chrysallidinae, Cingulininae, Cyclostremellinae, Sayellinae, Syrnolinae, Eulimellinae, Pyramidellinae, Odostomellinae and Tiberiinae.  2005 taxonomy  In the taxonomy of Bouchet & Rocroi (2005), this subfamily consists of the following tribes, adding the tribe Sayellini containing only two genera Sayella and Petitella. *Tribe Pyramidellini Gray, 1840 *Tribe Sayellini Wise, 1996 - former subfamily Sayellinae ==Genera == According to Schander, Van Aartsen & Corgen (1999) there are 12 genera within the Pyramidellinae: tribe Pyramidellini * Callolongchaeus Dall, 1903 * Creonella Wade, 1917 * Lacrimiforma Sohl, 1963 * Locklinia Bartsch, 1955 * Longchaeus M√∂rch, 1875WoRMS (2010).

Previously, it was a 50‚Äì50 joint venture between Shell Oil Company (the wholly owned American subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell) and Saudi Refining Inc. (controlled by Saudi Aramco). In 1988, Texaco and Saudi Refining agreed to form a joint venture known as Star Enterprise in which Saudi Refining would own a 50 percent share of Texaco's refining and marketing operations in the eastern United States and Gulf Coast. In 1997, Shell embarked on two joint ventures with Texaco in which the companies merged their marketing and refining operations. The operations in the western and midwestern United States were merged into a company called Equilon. The Star Enterprise operation and Shell's eastern and southeastern operations were merged into a company called Motiva. After Texaco merged with Chevron in 2001, Shell and Saudi Refining purchased Texaco's interests in the joint ventures. Equilon became a fully owned subsidiary of Shell, while Saudi Aramco and Shell each became equal owners of Motiva. The Motiva joint venture was formed in 1998 and operated as a 50/50 refining and marketing joint venture between the parties from 2002-April 2017. In March 2017, Royal Dutch Shell plc signed definitive agreements with Saudi Refining Inc. that gave full ownership of refining and marketing joint venture Motiva Enterprises, LLC to Saudi Refining. Beginning in the mid-2010s, Motiva has obtained an exclusive license for the 76 gasoline brand, previously a West Coast-only brand. Therefore, 76-branded stations have appeared in Motiva's northeast markets. Similarly, Philips 66 and Conoco-branded outlets have also appeared (presumably under the same deal); it marks the return of the Philips 66 name to the Northeast, as they withdrew from the market in 1972. ==Operations== Motiva Enterprises owns and operates the Port Arthur Refinery in Port Arthur, Texas. On 25 May 2012, Motiva officially completed its expansion of the refinery to a capacity of making it the largest refinery in North America and the fifth largest in the world.

It was a quadrupedal animal covered in thick armoured scales that ran down the length of its body. A slow-moving browser, it would have used this heavy body armour to repel attacks from contemporary thecodont carnivores. Stagonolepis had a very small head for its size; it was only , accounting for less than 10% of the total body length. It had no teeth in the front of its jaws, but instead had a beak-like tip that arched upwards. This would have allowed it to uproot plants in a similar manner to a modern pig. The peg-like teeth at the back of its mouth would have been suitable for chewing tough vegetation, including horsetails, ferns, and the newly evolved cycads. Restoration of S. robertsoni, based on Scott Hartman's skeletal A 2018 paper suggested that Stagonolepis olenkae's forelimb morphology is an adaptation for scratch-digging. According to paleontologist Dawid Dr√≥≈ºd≈º, \\"S. olenkae might have used its robust forelimbs to break through the compacted soil with its claws and proceed to dig in search of food in softened substrate with the shovel-like expansion at the tip of its snout.\\" == Species == Model of S. olenkae at the Museum of Evolution Warsaw Fossil remains of S. robertsoni have been found in Lossiemouth Sandstone of Scotland, while S. olenkae is known from deposits near Krasiej√≥w, Poland. S. olenkae is stratigraphically younger the type species of Stagonolepis, S. robertsoni, although it is questioned by some researchers and described as an example of intraspecific variety (e. g. sexual dimorphism) The genus Aetosauroides from South America has been considered a junior synonym of Stagonolepis by some paleontologists. Two species of Aetosauroides were named, A. scagliai and A. subsulcatus. In 2002, Andrew B. Heckert and Spencer G. Lucas proposed that smaller specimens of both species belong to Stagonolepis robertsoni, and larger specimens to S. wellesi. S. wellesi itself was originally named Calyptosuchus, a stagonolepidid from the Late Triassic Dockum Group of the United States, which was considered to be a species of Stagonolepis by Murray & Long in 1989. However, most of the sequential studies conclude that both Aetosauroides and Calyptosuchus are valid and monotypic genera, the former occurs only in South America and the latter only in the United States. Stagonolepis is restricted to the Carnian stage of Scotland and Poland. == References == Category:Aetosaurs Category:Carnian life Category:Late Triassic reptiles of Europe Category:Triassic England Category:Fossils of England Category:Triassic Germany Category:Fossils of Germany Category:Fossils of Poland Category:Late Triassic reptiles of North America Category:Triassic United States Category:Fossils of the United States Category:Chinle fauna Category:Paleontology in New Mexico Category:Fossil taxa described in 1844 Category:Taxa named by Louis Agassiz ","title":"Stagonolepis"},{"id":"5602683","text":"1A or 1-A may refer to: ==Arts and entertainment== * 1A (comics), a comic book robot * 1A (radio program), an American radio program ==Politics== * * First Amendment (disambiguation), the first amendment of various legislation ==Science and technology== * Group 1A, an obsolete designation for the group 1 elements * AMY1A, a human gene * Alpha-1A adrenergic receptor, a human gene * Interferon beta-1a, a drug * Meltwater pulse 1A, a period of rapid post- glacial sea level rise, 13,500‚Äì14,700 years ago * Melatonin receptor 1A, a human gene * Metallothionein 1A, a human gene * MH-1A, a nuclear power reactor and the first floating nuclear power station * Vasopressin receptor 1A, a major receptor type for vasopressin ==Sports== * Croatian 1A Volleyball League * 1.

The texture of these shells is sculptured with ribs. Their color is mostly white, brown, cream or yellowish, sometimes with red or brown lines. The teleoconch is dextrally coiled, but the larval shells are sinistral. This results in a sinistrally coiled protoconch. The aperture is closed by an operculum. ==Life habits== The Odostomellinae are ectoparasites, but the hosts are unknown. They do not have a radula. Instead their long proboscis is used to pierce the skin of its prey and suck up its fluids and soft tissues. The eyes on the grooved tentacles are situated toward the base of the tentacles. Between the head and the foot, a lobed process called the mentum (= thin projection) is visible. These molluscs are hermaphrodites, laying eggs in jelly-like masses on the shell of its host.

It lived during the Late Triassic. ==Description== D. spurensis compared to a human Desmatosuchus was a large quadruped upwards of 4.5 meters in length. Its vertebral column had amphicoelus centra and 3 sacral vertebrae. The scapulae had large acromion processes. The forelimbs were much shorter than the hindlimbs, with humeri less than two-thirds the length of the femurs. The pelvic girdle consisted of a long pubis with a strong symphysis in the middle, a plate-like ischium, a highly recurved ilium, and a deep, imperforate acetabulum. The femurs were relatively long and straight, the ankles crurotarsal, with calcaneal tubers that gave it large heels. D. spurensis skull model Its skull was relatively small, on average about 37 centimeters long, 18 centimeters wide, and 15 centimeters high. The braincase was very firmly fused with the skull roof and palate. It had slender, forked premaxillae that turned up and expanded in the front, creating a shovel-like structure. Desmatosuchus is unique among aetosaurs in that its species are the only known aetosaurs that lacked teeth on their premaxillae. Their premaxillae fit loosely together with their maxillae, indicating flexibility at that joint. Their maxilla contained 10 to 12 teeth. Desmatosuchus also had very thin vomers, which bounded the medial side of the internal nares. These internal nares were relatively large, roughly half the length of the entire palate. The lower jaw typically carried 5 or 6 teeth, and had a toothless beak on the end. The dentary was about half the length of the lower jaw, with the front portion being toothless and covered by a horny sheath. Behind the dentary was a moderately large mandibular fenestra. Individuals of Desmatosuchus were heavily armored. The carapace was made up of two rows of median scutes surrounded by two more rows of lateral scutes. The lateral scutes had well-developed spine-like processes which pointed out laterally and dorso-posteriorly. There were typically five rows of spines, increasing in size anteriorly. The front spine was much larger, around 28 centimeters long, and was recurved. The fourth spine varies in length in each specimen, but remains shorter than the fifth in all of them. Desmatosuchus are the only aetosaurs known to have possessed spines like these. ==Discovery and classification== The first Desmatosuchus discovery occurred in the late 19th century when E.D. Cope classified armor from the Dockum Group in Texas, USA, as the new species Episcoposaurus haplocerus. Case later classified a partial skeleton found in the Tecovas Formation as Desmatosuchus spurensis. Since the localities of Cope and Case were only a few kilometers apart, the two taxa were synonymized into Desmatosuchus haplocerus, the initial type species of the genus. A revision of Desmatosuchus by Parker (2008) found the lectotype of Episcoposaurus haplocerus to be referable to Desmatosuchus but indeterminate at the species level. Therefore, E. haplocerus was considered to be a nomen dubium and D. spurensis was named the type species of the genus. Two species were accepted as valid: D. spurensis and D. smalli, named after Brian J. Small for his contribution to the study of this genus. Desmatosuchus chamaensis is recognized as a distinct genus, but there is some dispute about whether the name Heliocanthus or Rioarribasuchus applies. The following cladogram is simplified, after an analysis presented by Julia B. Desojo, Martin D. Ezcurra and Edio E. Kischlat (2012). Desmatosuchus skeleton from the University of Michigan Museum of Natural History == Paleobiology == D. haplocerus from the Late Triassic of Texas Bones and armor pieces of Desmatosuchus are abundant in the Dockum formation, Chinle formation, and Post quarry, indicating that they were widespread and abundant during the Late Triassic. It is possible that Desmatosuchus traveled in herds or family units. This is evidenced by several findings of multiple Desmatosuchus skeletons in relatively small areas. Desmatosuchus had blunt, bulbous, slightly recurved teeth. Furthermore, they are believed to have had homodont dentition. This, combined with its shovel like snout, indicate that Desmatosuchus fed by digging up soft vegetation. This method of feeding is further evidenced by its toothless premaxilla and dentary tip, which were covered in horny sheaths. These sheaths protected the bones and could be used for cutting or holding objects. It is believed that Desmatosuchus dug for food in the soft mud near bodies of water due to the abundance of lakes and rivers in the Dockum area and the fact that Desmatosuchus scutes are often found among parts of other reptiles that are known to have fed along waterways. It is unknown whether or not Desmatosuchus replaced their teeth and, if so, how. The low number of Desmatosuchus teeth that have been discovered indicates that they were only held in place by soft tissue connections. The jaw articulation point is below the tooth line, holding its upper and lower tooth rows parallel while biting in a way that is reminiscent of ornithischian dinosaurs. Postosuchus and Desmatosuchus The armor and spikes of Desmatosuchus were its only ways to defend itself from predators. The lateral spike rows showed variation in size among individuals, especially the second most anterior spike. This spike was always shorter than the one in front of it, but to what extent varied drastically. This variation may indicate sexual dimorphism. It has also been hypothesized as a form of sexual display. Aside from this armor, Desmatosuchus was defenseless from attacks from carnivores. Several Desmatosuchus bones have been found amongst skeletons of Postosuchus, indicating predation by Postosuchus. The herd nature of Desmatosuchus apparently did little to discourage predators, as Postosuchus along with several other Late Triassic carnivores also traveled in groups. Most thecodonts of the Late Triassic lacked certain pelvic features that aided locomotion, such as a deep acetabulum or a crest over the acetabulum. This, in spite of their upright posture, rendered them only slightly more mobile than sprawling reptiles. Desmatosuchus possessed both of these features, along with its long femur and elongate pubis, making it more mobile than most thecodonts of its time. This mobility, along with its size, abundance, and specialized beak made it the chief herbivore in the Dockum area. It has also been suggested that Desmatosuchus could have been omnivorous or even an insectivore. This is because of several similarities between Desmatosuchus and armadillos. For instance, both groups are armored. They possess long snouts that lack teeth on the end. Also, there is evidence of bees, wasps, and termites in the Late Triassic, meaning that Desmatosuchus had access to insects that armadillos prey on. Their teeth are somewhat similar in shape, although armadillos have more peg-like teeth. Both Desmatosuchus and armadillos typically carry around 6 teeth on their dentaries. Both armadillos and Desmatosuchus have hypertrophied processes present on their limb bones, which indicates large limb muscles. This connection is more tenuous, however, since Desmatosuchus have a crest over their hind limbs but lack one on their forelimbs, meaning that they likely didn't have the musculature for digging with their forelimbs the way armadillos do. In spite of these parallels, the general consensus is still that Desmatosuchus was most likely herbivorous. ==References== Category:Aetosaurs of North America Category:Chinle fauna Category:Late Triassic pseudosuchians ","title":"Desmatosuchus"},{"id":"5602748","text":"Dakhiliyah () is a town located in Al-Hasakah Governorate, Syria. ==References== Category:Populated places in Al-Hasakah Governorate ","title":"Dakhiliyah"},{"id":"5602751","text":"==Overview== The Korg N264 and N364 keyboards were 76- and 61-key (respectively) music workstation synthesizers based on the AI2 (Advanced Integrated System) synthesis engine, with eight megabytes of sample rom first released in 1996.

She was outfitted with heavy guns for intercepting blockade runners and howitzers for shore bombardment. Tallapoosa remained in service after the war and served in various capacities, including schoolship for midshipmen of the United States Naval Academy. She was sold in Uruguay in 1892. == Built by the New York Navy Yard == Tallapoosa ‚Äì the first U.S. Navy ship to have that name‚Äîwas built at the New York Navy Yard by C. W. Booz of Baltimore, Maryland on similar plans as . She was launched on 17 February 1863 and commissioned on 13 September 1864, Lieutenant Commander Joseph E. DeHaven in command. == Civil War service ==  Searching for CSS Tallahassee  As Tallapoosa was being fitted out, Confederate cruiser Tallahassee was cruising off the Atlantic coast destroying Union shipping from the Virginia Capes to Nova Scotia. Hence, the Union double-ender got underway late in October and spent her first days at sea in seeking the Southern commerce raider. Her quest took her from New York City to Halifax, then south to the Virginia Capes, then back north again to the coast of Nova Scotia. On 4 November, Tallapoosa encountered a southeasterly gale, which battered the ship for the next two days, disabled both her rudders, and caused other damage. She finally made port at Boston, Massachusetts on the morning of the 7th.  Assigned to the East Gulf blockade  Following repairs at the Boston Navy Yard which lasted over a month and one-half, Tallapoosa was assigned to the East Gulf Blockading Squadron. Her most notable duty during this assignment occurred on 11 January 1865 when she assisted in salvaging material and equipment from screw frigate which had run aground in the Bahamas on an uncharted reef near Green Turtle Cay off Grand Abaco Island. == Post-war service == After the American Civil War ended, Tallapoosa served in the Gulf Squadron‚Äîcruising in the West Indies and the Gulf of Mexico‚Äîuntil 1867 when she was laid up at the Washington Navy Yard.  Admiral Farragut on board  Tallapoosa's officers, 1873. Her Commanding Officer, Lieutenant David G. McRitchie, is seated in the center. Reactivated in 1869, the ship became a dispatch vessel, beginning a role which soon brought Tallapoosa one of her more interesting missions. In January 1870, she carried Admiral David Farragut to Portland, Maine, where he met at the end of that British turreted battleship's voyage across the Atlantic Ocean to return to the United States the remains of philanthropist George Peabody who had died in England. Early the following summer, the double-ender carried Farragut from New York City to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, to visit the commandant of the navy yard. It was hoped that the cool sea breezes of New England would improve the aged and ailing admiral's health. As Tallapoosa neared Portsmouth on 4 July, she fired an Independence Day salute to her famous passenger, the Navy's highest ranking and most respected officer. Upon hearing the warship's guns, Farragut left his sick-bed, donned his uniform, and walked to the man-of-war's quarterdeck. There he commented, \\"It would be well if I died now, in harness. ...\\" A month and 10 days later, Farragut died at Portsmouth.  Schoolship for the Naval Academy  At the Portsmouth Navy Yard, Kittery, Maine, circa 1886, following her final rebuilding. In 1872, Tallapoosa moved to Annapolis, Maryland, to serve as a training ship at the United States Naval Academy. The following year, she became a transport. While she performed this duty, her years of service began to show, and it became apparent that she needed extensive repair work. Hence, the ship was largely rebuilt at Baltimore, Maryland, in 1874 and 1875. There, revitalized and configured as a single-ender, the veteran warship resumed her role as a dispatch vessel and continued performing as such for almost a decade.  Raised after sinking  Shortly before midnight on 24 August 1884, Tallapoosa collided with schooner J. S. Lowell and sank about five miles from Vineyard Haven, Massachusetts. After the ship had been raised and repaired by the Merritt Wrecking Company, she was recommissioned at the New York Navy Yard on 11 January 1886. Assigned to the South Atlantic Squadron, Tallapoosa departed New York on 7 June 1886, bound for Rio de Janeiro. == Sold in Uruguay == Tallapoosa served along the coast of South America until 30 January 1892 when she was condemned as unfit for further service.

It has mounted many class action cases on behalf of investors, and has been recognized as among the leading firms in its field by the National Law Journal, RiskMetrics Group, Securities Class Action Services, and Law360. The firm and some of its partners were charged in 2006 with offering improper inducements to plaintiffs. The case against the firm itself was dismissed in 2008, but that same year four partners pleaded guilty to charges, and many others had already left the firm. In 2018, Milberg merged with Sanders Philips Grossman, a mass tort firm known for its class action lawsuits against pharmaceutical companies, to form Milberg Tadler Phillips Grossman. In 2019, former partner Steven Schulman sued the firm, claiming the merger was an attempt to circumvent the firm's debts to him. ==Founding and history== Melvyn Weiss convinced his partner, Lawrence Milberg, to fund class-action securities litigation against Dolly Madison Industries. Dolly Madison acquired at least 30 companies over an 18-month period. Dolly Madison was allegedly facilitating these deals by falsifying its balance sheet to artificially increase its stock price. Weiss and Milberg thought they could win a large payout from Dolly Madison's accounting firm, Touche Ross and Co., a \\"big eight\\" firm in the 1960s. Like most defendants in class actions, Dolly Madison delayed as long as possible and the case did not go to trial until 1973. Shortly before a verdict was rendered Touche settled for $2 million, resulting in a $500,000 fee for Milberg. Before its split in May 2004 with the firm now known as Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP, it was the largest plaintiff law firm in the United States, with over 200 attorneys, responsible, at least in part, for over 50 percent of all securities class action cases settled in 2002.1995‚Äì2003 Securities Settlements Review (pdf) ==Notable cases== Milberg was co-lead counsel in a securities fraud class action case against French conglomerate Vivendi. After nearly eight years of litigation, the case was tried to a jury for three months in late 2009, and resulted in a verdict for plaintiffs in January 2010. The jury found Vivendi liable for 57 false or misleading class period statements. Even with claimants who made foreign purchases removed from the class after the Supreme Court's Morrison v. National Australia Bank Ltd decision, total damages claims exceeded $1 billion. On August 24, 2011, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York approved a $180 million settlement to resolve antitrust claims brought by a class of consumers, represented by Milberg, against Sirius XM Radio. The case stems from the 2008 merger between Sirius Satellite Radio, Inc. and XM Satellite Holdings, Inc. that created Sirius XM, now the nation's only satellite radio company. The plaintiffs alleged that the merger of the only two U.S. satellite radio providers was an illegal move to eliminate competition and monopolize the satellite radio market. \\"Judge Approves Sirius Settlement\\" Milberg represented a healthcare worker in a whistleblower suit against his former employer Medline Industries, Inc., along with its charitable arm, The Medline Foundation. The Firm negotiated an $85 million settlement on behalf of the federal government, announced on March 11, 2011. The suit was filed under the False Claims Act (\\"FCA\\"), which allows private citizens to sue companies that are defrauding the government and to receive an award for their efforts when the case is successful. Although a party to the settlement agreement, the U.S. Department of Justice chose not to intervene in the lawsuit. Milberg pursued the case and obtained one of the largest settlements of an FCA case in which the government declined to intervene.http://www.lawyersandsettlements.com/articles/qui-tam-whistleblower- government-fraud/interview-qui-tam-whistleblower-lawsuit-8-16329.html In 2010, Milberg won a victory before the United States Supreme Court, which issued a decision (Merck & Co., Inc. v. Reynolds) addressing when an investor is placed on \\"inquiry notice\\" of securities fraud violation sufficient to trigger the statute of limitations under 28 U.S.C. ¬ß 1658(b). Other milestones in the Firm's history include its involvement in the \\"US Financial\\" litigation in the early 1970s, one of the earliest large class actions, which resulted in the $50 million recovery for purchasers of the securities of a failed real estate development company; Other cases included the Ninth Circuit decision in Blackie v. Barrack in 1975, which established the fraud-on-the-market doctrine for securities fraud actions; the Firm's co-lead counsel position in the In re Washington Public Power Supply System (WPPSS) Securities Litigation, a seminal securities fraud action in the 1980s in terms of complexity and amounts recovered; the representation of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. in a year-long trial to recover banking losses from a major accounting firm, leading to a precedent-setting global settlement; attacking the Drexel-Milken \\"daisy chain\\" of illicit junk-bond financing arrangements with numerous cases that resulted in substantial recoveries for investors; and representing life insurance policyholders defrauded by \\"vanishing premium\\" and other improper sales tactics and obtaining large recoveries from industry participants. Milberg's attorneys also argued another important case in 2007 before the high court in Tellabs Inc. v.

S. Department of Justice press release. the firm and two of its named partners, David J. Bershad and Steven G. Schulman (Schulman resigned in December 2006), were indicted by a grand jury in the United States District Court for the Central District of California on various counts, including racketeering, mail fraud, and bribery. The charges included claims that Milberg Weiss paid portions of its legal fees to plaintiffs in order to induce them to sue. By January 2007, more than half of the firm's partners had left the firm. As of June 2008, the firm's website lists only 53 full-time attorneys (29 partners and 24 associates). On June 16, 2008, U.S. prosecutors in Los Angeles dismissed the indictment against the firm, under a non-prosecution agreement, and a statement by the government that \\"no attorney currently a partner or associate with Milberg LLP is criminally culpable\\" with respect to conduct charged in the indictment. Milberg agreed to pay $75 million to settle the charges. However, four longtime Milberg Weiss partners pleaded guilty to federal charges, including Steven Schulman, David Bershad, William Lerach, and Melvyn Weiss. Melvyn Weiss pleaded guilty in exchange for an 18- to 33-month prison sentence and fines and restitution of $10 million. Lerach was sentenced to two years in federal prison, two years' probation, fined $250,000 and ordered to complete 1,000 hours of community service. Bershad paid $250,000 in fines and forfeited $7.75 million. Bershad was sentenced to six months of incarceration in October 2008. Weiss was sentenced to 30 months of incarceration on Monday June 2, 2008. He was released in February 2010. Bershad was released from custody on July 2, 2009, and Schulman was released on July 10, 2009. Lerach was released on March 8, 2010. ==See also== * Lexecon Inc. v.

Fossils have been found in Wales and Southern England and date from near the very end of the Late Triassic during the Rhaetian, and it is known by type and only known species T. gracilis. Terrestrisuchus was a long- legged, active predator that lived entirely on land, unlike modern crocodilians. It inhabited a chain of tropical, low-lying islands that made up southern Britain, along with similarly small-sized dinosaurs and abundant rhynchocephalians. Numerous fossils of Terrestrisuchus are known from fissures in limestone karst which made up the islands it lived on, which formed caverns and sinkholes that preserved the remains of Terrestrisuchus and other island- living reptiles. ==Description== Size comparison Terrestrisuchus was a small, slender crocodylomorph with very long legs, quite unlike modern crocodilians. It was initially estimated to have been between long, although this estimate may be based on juvenile specimens and fully grown Terrestrisuchus may have reached or exceeded in length. Its skull was long and narrow, with a tapering, pointed triangular snout lined with sharp curved teeth. The upper jaw margin was straight, and lacked a diastema (a gap in the tooth row) between the maxilla and the premaxilla. By contrast, the long and slender dentary bones of the lower jaw curved slightly upwards towards the front. Unlike modern crocodilians, the eye of Terrestrisuchus was supported by a ring of bony ossicles, the sclerotic ring. Skeletal restoration showing known remains The body was relatively short and shallow, and the spine was topped by paired rows of osteoderms running down from its neck down its back. These osteoderms are described as \\"leaf-shaped\\", being relatively longer than wide with a prominent spur at the front that slides under and interlocks with the scute in front of it. This provides a rigid support for the body and limited the flexibility of its spine, supporting its body on land. The hips of Terrestrisuchus had an elongated pubis, unlike living crocodilians. Terrestrisuchus is also known to have had tightly packed gastralia, or belly ribs. Its tail was particularly long, about twice the length of the head and body combined with an estimated 70 caudal vertebrae in total, and may have been used as a balance allowing the animal to rear up and run on its hind legs for brief periods. Limbs and posture Unlike modern crocodylians, the limbs of Terrestrisuchus were very long in proportion to the body and were held upright directly beneath it. The shape of the ankles and the bones in the hands and feet also suggest that Terrestrisuchus was digitigrade, with elongated metacarpus (wrist) and metatarsal bones that were pressed tightly together, similar to the feet of fast-running dinosaurs, suggesting that Terrestrisuchus was highly cursorial, adapted for running at high speeds. The pisiform bone in the wrist is notably smaller compared to early crocodyliforms such as Protosuchus, as well as modern crocodilians, indicating that Terrestrisuchus had less flexible wrists. Crush reconstructed Terrestrisuchus as a quadruped, with noticeably longer hind limbs than its forelimbs and its hips held high above the shoulder. However, based on these proportions it has also been suggested that Terrestrisuchus may have been bipedal instead. Notably, the acetabulum (hip socket) of Terrestrisuchus is perforated and forms an opening between the hip bones. This feature is otherwise only known in dinosaurs (as well as a few other early crocodylomorphs) and is often regarded as a defining feature of that clade. Similarly, the femur of Terrestrisuchus has a distinct head that faces inwards towards the body, and fits into the hip socket at a right angle to the leg. This condition is described as \\"buttress-erect\\", and it is typical of dinosaurs and their close relatives but otherwise unheard of in pseudosuchians outside of basal crocodylomorphs. Other pseudosuchians with upright limbs were typically \\"pillar-erect\\", with their femurs attached into a hip-socket that faced directly downwards. The buttress-erect posture of Terrestrisuchus and other basal crocodylomorphs is unique amongst crocodile- line archosaurs, and restricted its posture to a permanently upright stance. Its posture was further restricted to an upright gait by the calcaneal tubercle on its heel bone pointing directly backwards from the foot, unlike the back-and-sideways facing tuber of modern, sprawling crocodilians. ==History of discovery== The first fossils of Terrestrisuchus were discovered by Professor K. A. Kermack and Dr. P. L. Robinson in the spring of 1952, recovered from the Pant-y-ffynon Quarry located near Cowbridhe, Glamorgan in South Wales. Their finds were presented by Kermack to the Linnean Society of London on October 8, 1953, and was recognised belonging to a \\"primitive crocodile or crocodile ancestor\\". No osteoderms had been identified yet at the time, which Kermack regarded as representing a \\"missing link\\" between modern crocodilians and the Triassic \\"thecodonts\\". The fossils included several well- preserved articulated partial skeletons and various isolated bones. Kermack refrained from naming the animal or nominating a type specimen, as preparation of the fossils was still ongoing. The specimens were eventually named and thoroughly described by P. J. Crush in 1984, with the generic name Terrestrisuchus chosen to emphasise the terrestrial lifestyle of this crocodylomorph, and the specific name from the Latin gracilis for its light, graceful build. The Pant-y-ffynnon Quarry is composed mostly of Carboniferous limestone, but the fossils of Terrestrisuchus were recovered from Triassic sedimentary rocks that were deposited within fissures in the limestone (such as sandstones and marls). The age of the deposits has been historically debated, with older literature suggesting a Carnian to Norian age. However, palynological data has been used to determine a younger Rhaetian age, close to the very end of the Triassic. This estimate has been corroborated by Rhaetian index fossils such as conchostracans and geomorphological data. Additional material attributed to Terrestrisuchus has been discovered in other Late Triassic fissure deposits in South Wales and Bristol, including the Ruthin Quarry in Wales and the Tytherington and Cromhall quarries near Bristol, as well as a possible specimen from Durdham Down. The fossils of Terrestrisuchus were originally housed at University College, London before being transferred to the Natural History Museum in London where they are currently stored. ==Classification== Terrestrisuchus was originally classified as a member of the crocodylomorph suborder \\"Sphenosuchia\\", a group that included various other similar long-legged early crocodylomorphs and was considered to be a separate radiation from the group that all later crocodylomorphs would evolve from. However, this classification was made prior to the invention of cladistic phylogenetic analyses, which has since demonstrated that \\"Sphenosuchia\\" is an unnatural grouping (paraphyletic), meaning that \\"sphenosuchians\\" are not all descended from a single common ancestor to the exclusion of all other crocodylomorphs. Instead, the \\"sphenosuchians\\" are a grade of basal crocodylomorphs that lead up to the more derived crocodyliforms. Nonetheless, Terrestrisuchus has consistently been recovered within this grade, as shown in the cladogram below from Leardi et al. (2017): ==Palaeobiology== Terrestrisuchus depicted hunting a cockroach The thin, serrated teeth of Terrestrisuchus indicate that it was carnivorous, and like other early crocodylomorphs it was likely a generalist pursuit hunter that preyed upon small to mid-sized prey items. The shape and construction of its hip bones, particularly the elongated pubis, indicate that they were rigidly sutured together and that its pubis was not mobile as it is in modern crocodilians. This indicates that Terrestrisuchus would not have utilised the hepatic piston method of breathing found in modern crocodilians. Metabolism and growth The microstructure of the limb bones of Terrestrisuchus show that it was well vascularised and contained large amounts of energy-consuming fibrolamellar bone tissue, indicating a relatively fast growth-rate for Terrestrisuchus compared to other archosauriforms and even other pseudosuchians. Such a high growth rate is in agreement with an elevated, \\"warm-blooded\\" metabolism. However, the related \\"sphenosuchian\\" Hesperosuchus was found to have a slower, more typical crocodilian-like growth rate, and so it is possible that the high growth rate of Terrestrisuchus was due to the sampled specimens being immature and still rapidly growing, and that adults had a slower metabolism. ==Palaeoecology== Terrestrisuchus was a coastal species, unusual for basal crocodylomorphs, which are typically known from inland floodplain environments. In the Late Triassic, the Pant-y-ffynnon Quarry and other quarries were part of ancient islands in a palaeo-archipelago that stretched across southern Wales and England to Bristol. The islands were forested karstic environments, riddled with fissures, sinkholes and caverns eroded into the limestone, environments which long limbed, agile reptiles like Terrestrisuchus may have been well suited to inhabit. On the Pant-y-ffynnon palaeo-island, Terrestrisuchus coexisted with other archosaurs such as the similarly long-legged, enigmatic pseudosuchian Aenigmaspina, the herbivorous sauropodomorph dinosaur Pantydraco, and possibly a coelophysoid theropod. Rhynchocephalians (relatives of modern tuataras) were very abundant and are known from at least three species including Clevosaurus cambrica, Diphydontosaurus and at least one or two unnamed species, which likely formed a large part of the diet of Terrestrisuchus (possibly evidenced by bite marks on the bones of Clevosaurus that likely belong to Terrestrisuchus). Terrestrisuchus was a relatively rare component of the island's fauna, an expected relationship for a predatory animal. == References == Category:Terrestrial crocodylomorphs Category:Triassic crocodylomorpha Category:Rhaetian life Category:Late Triassic reptiles of Europe Category:Triassic England Category:Triassic Wales Category:Fossils of England Category:Fossils of Wales Category:Fossil taxa described in 1984 ","title":"Terrestrisuchus"},{"id":"5602829","text":"Stephen Dixon (born in Newton-in-Furness, Lancashire) is a news presenter for Sky News, anchoring Sky News @ Breakfast, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.

The document succeeded the 1949 Constitution, originally adopted at the creation of the Hungarian People's Republic on 20 August 1949 and heavily amended on 23 October 1989. The 1949 Constitution was Hungary's first permanent written constitution and until it was replaced, the country was the only former Eastern Bloc nation without an entirely new constitution after the end of Communism. Both domestically and abroad, the 2011 constitution has been the subject of controversy. Among the claims critics make are that it was adopted without sufficient input from the opposition and society at large, that it reflects the ideology of the ruling Fidesz party, and enshrines it in office, that it is rooted in a conservative Christian worldview despite Hungary not being a particularly devout country, and that it curtails and politicizes previously independent institutions.

In an effort to push the public debt below 50% of gross domestic product (from above 80% at the time of adoption), the powers of the Constitutional Court on budget and tax matters are restricted until debt falls below 50%. The President is allowed to dissolve Parliament if a budget is not approved, and only companies with transparent activities and ownership structures are allowed to bid for government contracts. The powers of the head of the Hungarian National Bank are also limited, and the modification of tax and pension laws requires a two- thirds majority.Judy Dempsey, \\"Hungarian Parliament Approves New Constitution\\", The New York Times, 18 April 2011; accessed April 25, 2011 The life of a fetus is protected from the moment of conception, and although the move is seen as opening the possibility for a future ban or restrictions on abortion, existing laws were unaffected.

On 23 June, the National Assembly of Allied Councils adopted Hungary's first charter-like constitution, the Constitution of the Socialist Allied Council Republic of Hungary. However, that regime was crushed two months later and Hungary returned to its historical, unwritten pre-1918 constitution. Despite the lack of a written constitution, several constitutional laws were passed during the interwar period of the Kingdom of Hungary. Statute I of 1920 confirmed the monarchical form of government (albeit with a vacant throne, the king's powers being exercised by regent Mikl√≥s Horthy and his ministers) and vested legislative power in the diet. Statute XLVII dethroned the Habsburg- Lorraine dynasty. A second chamber was established by Statute XXII of 1926. Successive constitutional acts increased the power of the regent, who was empowered to nominate forty senators at first, and during World War II, eighty-seven.Ludwikowski, p.30 1949 Constitution In August 1949, with the Hungarian Working People's Party in complete control of the country, a constitution based on the 1936 Soviet Constitution was adopted,Ludwikowski, p.31 the party's leading role enshrined in the document.Harmathy, p.7 Its basic features remained in place until 1989, although a number of important amendments were made, including one in 1972 that proclaimed Hungary a socialist state.Rakowska-Harmstone, p.100 While the constitution guaranteed certain fundamental rights, their scope was limited by provisions stating they had to be exercised in harmony with the interests of the socialist society.Somody, p.211 In 1989, as the Communist regime ended, the legislature overwhelmingly approved nearly a hundred changes to the constitution which purged the document's Communist character. Hungary was now defined as a civil democratic and constitutional republic that respected \\"the values of both bourgeois democracy and democratic socialism.\\"Harmathy, p.8-9 After the opposition won free elections in 1990, references to democratic socialism and the planned economy were dropped.Harmathy, p. 9 Further modifications followed over the ensuing two decades,Dupr√©, p. 173-4 as successive plans for a new constitution did not reach fulfillment. \\"Magyar√°zkod√°sra k√©nyszer√ºl Gyurcs√°ny\\" (\\"Gyurcs√°ny Is Forced to Explain\\") , Magyar Nemzet, 4 April 2011; accessed April 25, 2011. 2011 Constitution Drafting process In 2010, a new government led by Fidesz initiated a drafting process for a new constitution.\\"Hungary's new constitution drafted by next March, says Fidesz official\\" , politics.hu, 2 August 2010; accessed August 18, 2010 \\"Bihari szerint mindig lehet jobb\\" (\\"According to Bihari, One May Always Do Better\\"), FN.hu, 7 August 2010; accessed August 18, 2010 A parliamentary committee for drafting the constitution was set up, with all five parliamentary parties represented; \\"Megalakult az alkotm√°ny-el≈ëk√©sz√≠t≈ë bizotts√°g\\" (\\"Constitutional Draft Committee Is Formed\\"), hirtv.hu, 28 June 2010; accessed June 23, 2011 the draft was composed on the iPad of J√≥zsef Sz√°jer, a member of the European Parliament.

The Hungarian Socialist Party and Politics Can Be Different (LMP), citing the ruling party's unwillingness to compromise on issues and their inability to change the outcome, boycotted both the drafting process and the vote.Zolt√°n Simon, \\"Hungary First to Write a Constitution on IPad, Lawmaker Says\\", Bloomberg, 4 March 2011; accessed April 25, 2011\\"Hungary's parliament passes controversial new constitution\\", Deutsche Welle, 18 April 2011; accessed April 25, 2011\\"Hungarian president signs new constitution despite human rights concerns\\", Deutsche Welle, 25 April 2011; accessed December 29, 2019 On April 25, President P√°l Schmitt signed the document into law, and it entered into force on the first day of 2012.\\"Hungarian president signs new constitution despite human rights concerns\\", Deutsche Welle, 25 April 2011; accessed April 25, 2011 The enactment came halfway through Hungary's six-month Presidency of the Council of the European Union. Domestic reactions and subsequent developments According to Fidesz parliamentary group chairman J√°nos L√°z√°r, the constitution marks a break with Hungary‚Äôs communist past, while Prime Minister Viktor Orb√°n said it completes a transition to democracy and allows for sound finances and clean government after years of mismanagement and scandals. However, the opposition accused Fidesz of using its two-thirds majority in Parliament to push through its own constitution without cross- party consensus. Prior to and during the vote to adopt the constitution, thousands of protesters demonstrated in Budapest against its adoption; among their complaints are that it is an attempt by the government to cement its power beyond its term, force its Christian ideology on the country and limit civil liberties. Lack of opposition participation was also mentioned, but Deputy Prime Minister Tibor Navracsics responded that other parties were invited to participate but refused. Members of the Hungarian business community mentioned possible future difficulties in adopting the euro, noting a provision that enshrines the forint as legal tender. However, a government official said that, if the two-thirds majority to change this provision could not be attained, it could be circumvented by other means, such as a referendum.\\"Foreign firms criticize Hungary's new constitution\\", Deutsche Welle, 20 April 2011; accessed April 25, 2011 One section of the preamble criticized by some historians as well as by the head of Hungary's Jewish community is the statement that the country lost its independence when it was invaded and occupied by Nazi Germany in March 1944. They asserted that the provision implies the state was not responsible for the ensuing deportation of Jews to extermination camps as part of the Holocaust and that it could affect future restitution claims.Thomas Orszag-Land, \\"Hungary 'deceitful' over Holocaust\\", The Jewish Chronicle, 10 June 2011; accessed June 12, 2011 Historian G√©za Jeszenszky strongly rejected criticism of the passage, saying the loss of Hungarian sovereignty in March 1944 due to foreign invasion is simply a historical fact that should not be denied. In its support, he also mentioned Germany's direct intervention into Hungarian politics, such as the arrest of cabinet members and of anti-German politicians. \\"Az alapt√∂rv√©ny √©s a magyar t√∂rt√©nelem\\" (\\"The Basic Law and Hungarian History\\") N√©pszabads√°g, 31 May 2011; accessed June 23, 2011 Socialist leader Attila Mesterh√°zy denounced what he called \\"Fidesz's party constitution\\" and promised to change the constitution \\"on the basis of a national consensus\\" following the next elections.\\"Socialists pledge to 'correct' constitution as soon as possible\\" , politics.hu, 13 April 2011; accessed April 26, 2011 L√°szl√≥ S√≥lyom, former President of Hungary and of the Constitutional Court, is a critic of limits imposed on the court and of the \\"common parliamentary wrangling\\" through which the charter was adopted.\\"Former state president warns about possible mistakes around new constitution\\" , politics.hu, 7 March 2011; accessed April 26, 2011\\"Constitution - Hungary European democracy despite basic law's shortcomings, says ex-president\\", mti.hu, 18 April 2011; accessed April 26, 2011 The day after New Year's Day 2012, the government held a gala celebration at the Hungarian State Opera House to mark the entry into force of the constitution.

Demonstrators included representatives from various civil groups and opposition parties, among them the Socialists.

Left-wing and liberal members of the European Parliament asserted that it fails to protect citizens' rights and reduces legislative checks and balances. Among these was Guy Verhofstadt, head of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, who said the constitution could limit \\"fundamental human rights\\" and was adopted without transparency, flexibility, a spirit of compromise and sufficient time for debate.\\"Hungarian People's Party deputies reject liberal group's concerns about new constitution\\" , politics.hu, 18 April 2011; accessed April 26, 2011 Werner Hoyer, Germany's deputy foreign minister, expressed his country's concern as well, prompting the Hungarian Foreign Affairs Ministry to dismiss the remarks as \\"inexplicable and unacceptable\\".\\"Orb√°n spokesman says Germany must not interfere with Hungary's adoption of new constitution\\" , politics.hu, 20 April 2011; accessed April 26, 2011 Additionally, United Nations Secretary- General Ban Ki-moon suggested the government should address concerns about the constitution.\\"UN Secretary-General cautions gov't over constitution and media law\\" , politics.hu, 19 April 2011; accessed April 25, 2011 In neighboring Slovakia, which has a significant Hungarian minority, at least three parties, including the governing Slovak Democratic and Christian Union, expressed concern about clauses that afford certain rights to ethnic Hungarians abroad, including the right to dual citizenship and the right to vote, and critics there fear that the move has expansive and nationalist objectives.

It annuls rulings of the Constitutional Court made before the 2011 constitution went into force, while allowing their legal effects to remain. It endows the president of the Kuria and the chief prosecutor with the power to initiate constitutional review of laws. While giving the Constitutional Court the power to review the constitution itself on procedural grounds, it stipulates that the court cannot annul a law passed by a two-thirds parliamentary majority. Judges and prosecutors are obliged to retire at the general retirement age, although that age is left unstated; the Kuria head and the chief prosecutor are exempt. The amendment enshrines freedom of religion and allows constitutional complaints regarding the church law. It allows civil lawsuits for hate speech targeting an individual's community, and declares that communism is condemned. The measure requires students whose education is subsidized by the state to work in Hungary for a period after graduation or reimburse their tuition costs to the state. It allows only public media to air political advertising prior to general and European elections. The importance of the traditional family is stressed, and authorities are empowered to ban living in certain public spaces, although homelessness is not outlawed. A prior proposal on requiring voters to register prior to elections was not included after being earlier voided by the Constitutional Court.\\"Preview: Parliament to vote on controversial constitutional amendments on Monday\\" , politics.hu, 9 March 2013; accessed March 21, 2013 The amendment drew criticism both within Hungary and abroad. The Socialist floor leader labeled the measure an attempt to restrict the Constitutional Court's powers, and party members hung black flags from the Hungarian Parliament Building's windows, in sign of mourning for democracy. The LMP charged that the government was \\"dismantling constitutional values\\", while former prime minister Ferenc Gyurcs√°ny, head of the small Democratic Coalition, also drew attention to the diminution in the court's prerogatives. A protest in Budapest held in the days before parliamentary approval was given drew several thousands,\\"Thousands demonstrate against new constitutional amendments in Budapest\\" , politics.hu, 9 March 2013; accessed March 21, 2013 while on the day of the vote, a few hundred turned out.\\"Protesters against constitutional amendments block Chain Bridge in Budapest\\" , politics.hu, 12 March 2013; accessed March 21, 2013 Jos√© Manuel Barroso, President of the European Commission, and Thorbj√∏rn Jagland, Secretary General of the Council of Europe, together raised concerns about the amendment's impact on the rule of law,\\"EU to examine whether Hungary‚Äôs constitutional amendments conform with law\\" , politics.hu, 13 March 2013; accessed March 21, 2013 while prominent EU politicians, including Verhofstadt and Martin Schulz, expressed more forceful criticism.\\"Top EU politicians condemn Hungary‚Äôs decision to amend the Constitution\\" , politics.hu, 12 March 2013; accessed March 21, 2013 Orb√°n denied that the powers of the Constitutional Court had been curtailed, challenging critics to explain just how the amendment is undemocratic,\\"Orb√°n says Constitutional Court has lost none of its powers to assess laws\\" , politics.hu, 14 March 2013; accessed March 21, 2013 while his party explained that the measure was needed in order to delineate the new constitution from the previous one. That September, a fifth amendment was passed in response to recommendations from the Constitutional Court, the European Commission and the Venice Commission. Approved by Fidesz parliamentarians, it was opposed by LMP and the Socialists, while Jobbik abstained. The provision granted the National Bank oversight of financial markets; eliminated a provision allowing judicial cases to be transferred from one court to another, as well as one allowing taxes to be raised for financing fines charged to the Hungarian state by international court rulings; clarified the recognition of religious communities and allowed political campaign ads to be aired on public as well as commercial television and radio free of charge.\\"Hungary‚Äôs parliament approves 5th constitutional amendment\\" , politics.hu, 16 September 2013; accessed March 7, 2014 Following the amendment's adoption, Jagland praised the fact that the government had made an effort to address international criticism. \\"Magyarorsz√°g b≈±nlajstroma ‚Äì ez√©rt t√°mad az EU √©s Amerika\\", valasz.hu, 6 November 2014; accessed November 19, 2014 ==NotesReferences== * Dupr√©, Catherine.

Tom Macleod and Samantha Washington present the Friday edition. ==Overview== Sky News Today was launched in September 2002, presented by Martin Stanford and Julie Etchingham, broadcast on weekdays between 10:00am and 1:00pm. In contrast to the rest of Sky News' coverage at that time, Sky News Today was largely presented from the heart of the newsroom, with frequent use being made of a large videowall at the back of the newsroom. When Sky News underwent a major relaunch in October 2005, Sky News Today relaunched with it; it was brought forward an hour, now running from 9am to 12pm, and an afternoon edition was introduced, from 2pm until 5pm. The programme was now also presented by three presenters at a time: the morning edition by Martin Stanford, Anna Botting and former BBC News presenter Anna Jones, and the afternoon edition by Mark Longhurst, Stephen Dixon and new signing Ginny Buckley. The three-presenter format was axed in early 2006, with the strand returning to a more traditional two-presenter format. In October 2007, Sky made the move to single headed presentation with Julie Etchingham becoming the anchor of Sky News Today between 9am and 1pm on weekdays; news summaries were presented by Colin Brazier. From Tuesday 8 January 2008, former BBC Breakfast anchor Dermot Murnaghan replaced Julie Etchingham as main presenter of the show. Etchingham moved to ITV News to present the relaunched News at Ten with Sir Trevor McDonald. Likewise Emma Crosby took over the news summaries from Colin Brazier who moved to Afternoon Live to work alongside Kay Burley. However, shortly after taking up the headline post, Crosby moved to Sky's business news department, and then onto GMTV. In February 2009, Sky News Today was reduced by one hour, broadcasting from 10am to 1pm (once again since October 2005), with The Live Desk running from 9am to 10am. From January 2011, the strand started airing on Saturdays, and no longer featured a news summary presenter. Dermot now presented Monday to Wednesday with Colin Brazier presenting from Thursday - Saturday. In September 2014, as part of a schedule revamp at Sky News, double-headed presentation was reinstated; a new strand running from 9am to 12pm weekdays was launched, presented by Colin Brazier and Jayne Secker. Dermot Murnaghan now presents a lunchtime slot from Monday to Wednesday. From 26 September 2016, the slot moved to start at 11am, as part of a new schedule; from 24 October, it was extended to 4 hours, finishing at 3pm. During the summer of 2017, the program had a different format. Seeing as All Out Politics was on a summer break, one presenter presented from 10‚Äì12, it was double headed from 12‚Äì1, and then the presenter who started at noon took over from 1‚Äì3. As of April 2019, on Mondays to Thursdays the program runs from 11am until 1.30pm, with Ian King Live following from 1.30pm until 2pm. On Fridays, the program runs from 11am until 2pm as there is no Ian King Live. ==Presenter history== Morning edition {  - ! valign=\\"middle\\" style=\\"width:15em\\"Dates ! valign=\\"middle\\" style=\\"width:15em\\" Presenter One ! valign=\\"middle\\" style=\\"width:15em\\" Presenter Two ! valign=\\"middle\\" style=\\"width:15em\\" Presenter Three ! valign=\\"middle\\" style=\\"width:15em\\" News Summaries -  September 2002 - October 2005  rowspan=3Martin Stanford  Julie Etchingham   -  October 2005 - March 2006  Anna Botting  Anna Jones  -  March 2006 - July 2006  rowspan=4Anna Jones   -  July 2006 - September 2006  Chris Roberts   -  September 2006 - February 2007  Colin Brazier   -  February 2007 - September 2007  Martin Stanford   -  October 2007 - January 2008  Julie Etchingham    Colin Brazier -  January 2008 - December 2010  Dermot Murnaghan    Various -  January 2011 - August 2014  Dermot Murnaghan (Mon - Wed) Colin Brazier (Thu - Sat)    -  September 2014 - September 2016  Colin Brazier  Jayne Secker   } Afternoon edition {  - ! valign=\\"middle\\" style=\\"width:15em\\"Dates ! valign=\\"middle\\" style=\\"width:12em\\" Presenter One ! valign=\\"middle\\" style=\\"width:12em\\" Presenter Two ! valign=\\"middle\\" style=\\"width:12em\\" Presenter Three -  October 2005 - May 2006  rowspan=\\"3\\"  Mark Longhurst  Steve Dixon  Ginny Buckley -  May 2006 - June 2006  Ginny Buckley  -  June 2006 - September 2006  rowspan=\\"2\\"  Julie Etchingham  -  September 2006 - September 2007  Colin Brazier  -  September 2016 ‚Äì present  Colin Brazier (Monday- Thursday) Tom Macleod (Friday)  Jayne Secker (Monday-Thursday) Samantha Washington (Friday)  } ==References== Category:2002 British television series debuts Category:2010s British television series Category:2020s British television series Category:Sky News Category:Sky UK original programming Category:English-language television shows Category:Sky television news shows ","title":"Sky News Today"},{"id":"5602867","text":"Kra≈° () is a Croatian food company based in Zagreb, specializing in confectionery products.

T. geoffroyi, described on the basis of now destroyed mandibular fragments, was considered a valid species by Vignaud (1995),Vignaud, P., ‚ÄúThe Thalattosuchia, Mesozoic marine crocodiles: phylogenetic systematics, paleoecology, biochronology and palaeogeographical implications.\\" Unpublished PhD thesis, University of Poitiers, 1995, p.410 but it became a probable synonym of T. cadomensis in 2020.

A History of British Fossil Reptiles, Part III. 1-199 In 2019, the taxonomy of Teleosauroidea was reviewed and T. cadomensis was seen as the only valid species. The rest of the known species were absorbed into T. cadomensis or other genera. This study was published in October 2020. ==Description== Teleosaurus had highly elongate jaws, similar to those of a modern gharial.R. Owen (1842). Report on British fossil reptiles, part II. Report of the British Association for the Advancement of Science 11: 60-204. It had a long, slender, body, with a sinuous tail that would have helped propel it through the water. Its forelimbs were remarkably short, and would probably have been held close to the body when swimming to improve the animal's streamlining. Unlike modern crocodilians, it lived in the open ocean, and it probably caught fish and squid with its sharp, needle-like teeth. ==References== Category:Prehistoric reptile genera Category:Prehistoric marine crocodylomorphs Category:Middle Jurassic crocodylomorphs Category:Jurassic reptiles of Europe Category:Taxa named by √âtienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire ","title":"Teleosaurus"},{"id":"5602883","text":"\\"Rez\\" is a non-album track by Underworld, originally released in 1993 in the UK.

As an ichnogenus, the taxon is represented by (and named for) a 90-metre (295 ft) long series of fossil tracks, or ichnites, found in the spring of 1979 in the Atlas Mountains of present-day Morocco. At the time, this area would have been part of the splitting Gondwana supercontinent. The animal that produced the Breviparopus tracks is rumored to be one of the largest dinosaurs, though its exact size has been the subject of much debate.Wedel, M.

Accessed 1 November 2010. ==Fossil material and age== The combined length of the tracks of the foot and hand measured , and they were in width. They are commonly dated to the Jurassic period (approximately 160‚Äì175 million years ago), though they are more likely from the early Cretaceous, roughly 130-120 million years ago. They were first described by Jean-Michel Dutuit and Achmed Ouazzou in 1980.Dutuit, J.M. & A.

Length estimates as great as have been given in popular books such as Guinness World Records,Foot T., (2000). Guinness World Records, 2001 Edition. Guinness World Records Ltd. though these were based on the misconception that the figure was based on a single footprint, not the combined length of the fore and hind feet. In reality, the trackmakers of Breviparopus were likely somewhat smaller than this.Wedel, M.

This would result in an animal roughly long, assuming proportions similar to Giraffatitan. Earlier estimates that the prints were only wide, no larger than the feet of Diplodocus, have since been shown to be incorrect.Comments on Wedel, M. (2009) Sauropod Vertebra Picture of the Week Sauropod Art-O-Rama, 17 November 2009 In 2020 Molina-P√©rez and Larramendi suggested that the narrow- gauge track, the position of the claws, and the era all indicate that it belonged to an enormous diplodocoid, and estimated its size at 33.5 meters (110 ft) and 62 tonnes (68.3 short tons). ==Taxonomy== Traditionally, Breviparopus has been regarded as a brachiosaur, which seemed to correspond with the fact that \\"Brachiosaurus\\" nougaredi, a brachiosaur known from a colossal sacrum, was discovered not too far from Morocco, in Early Cretaceous deposits in Wargla, Algeria. Since no actual bones of Breviparopus have been identified, it is difficult to say with certainty whether the tracks were made by a diplodocid, titanosaur or brachiosaur. All that can be said for certain, according to Michel Monbaron and colleagues, is that Breviparopus is quite distinct from the prints made by Atlasaurus.Monbaron, M., et al. (1999). \\"Atlasaurus imelakei n.g., n.sp., a brachiosaurid-like sauropod from the Middle Jurassic of Morocco.\\" Les Comptes rendus de l'Acad√©mie des sciences IIa: Earth and Planetary Sciences. 1999:519-526. However, the presence of a small medially directed thumb-claw printKristina Curry Rogers and Jeffrey A. Wilson. The Sauropods: evolution and paleobiology, University of California press, 2005, p. 264 makes it likely the animal was a brachiosaur, since they have small thumb claws at ground level (as opposed to diplodocids and camarasaurids, whose thumb metacarpals are short and hold their thumb claws off the ground), and the narrow-gauge stance also fits with a brachiosaur body shape - in the Early Cretaceous, the dominant sauropods were wide-bodied titanosaurs, and deep-bodied brachiosaurs which had more narrowly spaced legs - therefore the narrow gauge of the Breviparopus prints favors a brachiosaurid diagnosis (this seems to be corroborated by the sacrum of Brachiosaurus nougaredi, which is unusually narrow for its length even by brachiosaur standards). It is also worth noting that the bone fossil record from the Middle Jurassic, according to C.A. Meyer is rather more incomplete and fragmented than the fossil record of dinosaur tracks.Meyer, C.A. and Th√ºring, B. \\"Mind the 'Middle Jurassic' Gap - Bone versus Track Record in Dinosaurs.\\" ==See also== * List of dinosaur ichnogenera ==ReferencesExternal links== *Artist's rendering of 14 brachiosaurs, including Breviparopus scaled to the known 90 cm-wide tracks from Morocco. * First life restoration of Breviparopus by Nima Sassani, same artist as the above.

It was the former offices of the socialist newspaper Het Vrije Volk. The building is a six-storey office block located on a street called Slaak and was squatted in May 2003. The snooker centre next door, which hosted greats such as Ronnie O'Sullivan was also later squatted. In 2011, the complex was evicted and by 2017 it had become a hotel and a Lidl supermarket. ==History== The building was designed by Jo Vegter in collaboration with Pieter Arend Leupen. It was built between 1954 and 1956, becoming the offices of the socialist national newspaper Het Vrije Volk. Behind the offices (which included a bookshop and a travel agency) was the printworks and two company residences. From the 1990s onwards, the Netherlands' largest snooker centre was based in the Slaak complex. Snooker greats such as Stephen Hendry and Ronnie O'Sullivan played there. In 2007 the centre was closed and it was later squatted. ==Squatted== The Slaak was squatted in May 2003 as part of a national squatting action day. When initially squatted, the space hosted film nights, workshops, parties and a cafe. There was a free shop and lessons were taught in Dutch and kung fu. It also hosted a shop from WORM on the ground floor. From 2006 onwards, the squatters were in negotiation with the owner (PWS) and the city council about the Slaakhuis being used as the base for a community art education project. It was declared a national monument.http://rijksmonumenten.nl/monument/530859/slaakhuys/rotterdam/ In 2011, the squatters were evicted from the office block and from the snooker centre a few months later.

Elvis didn't let this romance get too intimate. In a 1997 interview with the San Francisco Chronicle, she swears that she never had sex with Presley. \\"I was tempted to, oh, yeah. But I was a virgin and the times were different back then.\\" In the same interview, she also blames his manager, Colonel Tom Parker, for encouraging Presley to go out with beautiful women for the publicity. According to Elvis biographer Peter Guralnick, Juanico didn't doubt that Elvis loved her, but \\"she didn't know if she could ever get him back,\\" because on one of their dates the singer was always talking about his best friend, actor Nick Adams. \\"He started telling her all about Nick and Nick's friends and Jimmy Dean, but she didn't want to hear.\\"Peter Guralnick, Last Train to Memphis: The Rise of Elvis Presley (1994), p.347-348. What really upset Juanico, though, was that Adams had started inviting himself to see Elvis, and Juanico felt that she was trying to compete for Elvis' attention. Adams would talk often about Natalie Wood to Elvis, constantly discussing her figure and her beauty, something else that caused Juanico to feel that she would soon lose Elvis to the glitz of Hollywood. Juanico's fears were not just a paranoia, as Elvis did have a short fling with Wood during his early days in Hollywood. Juanico was surprised when she heard about her former boyfriend's prescription drug abuse. \\"He never drank or did drugs when I was around him,\\" she says. She thinks she might have prevented Elvis from becoming dependent on drugs when they had stayed together. \\"When Elvis died, I felt guilty. I've never been able to understand how he could be surrounded with so many people who supposedly loved him and yet they allowed him to do that to himself.\\" She wrote a book on Presley entitled, Elvis in the Twilight of Memory (1997). According to the New York Times review, the book reads \\"like a high-school diary, clich√©s abound, intimate descriptions of sexual fumblings tell us more than we really want to know, and dialogue between the lovers sounds like a movie script in dire need of rewrite. ... However, her description of a 'special afternoon with just the two of us at the piano' with Presley singing 'Unchained Melody, just for you, baby' is touching.\\" ==ReferencesExternal links== * June Juanico Remembers Elvis Presley By Alanna Nash * Girls!

The village of Ashopton, Derwent Woodlands church and Derwent Hall were also 'drowned' in the construction of the reservoir. ==Preparations and creation of reservoir== All buildings in the village had been demolished by autumn 1943, and the impounded waters of the reservoir began to rise by the end of 1944. Derwent's packhorse bridge spanning the River Derwent near the main gates of Derwent Hall was removed stone by stone to be rebuilt elsewhere as it was designated a monument of national importance. The church tower of Derwent slowly disappearing below the water as the reservoir was filled in 1946 The church held its last service on 17 March 1943. The bell from the church may still be heard in Derbyshire, however, since it was re-hung in St Philip's Church in Chaddesden, built in 1955. Bodies from the graveyard had been exhumed in 1940 and were reburied in the village of Bamford. The church spire was left intact to form a memorial to Derwent. However, it was dynamited on 15 December 1947, on the rationale of safety concerns. ==Remains of the village== The site of the village has been revealed when the reservoir levels fell dramatically in 1976, 1989, 1995, 2003 and 2018. In 2018, the appearance of the village due to low water levels caused unprecedented crowds to visit the rarely visible site. On 3 November 2018 a man had to be rescued by a mountain rescue team after getting stuck in extremely thick mud around the ruins of the village. On 17 November 2018 it was reported that the site had been vandalised by some of those visiting, with park rangers forced to stop visitors removing items from the site and with graffiti scrawled on some buildings. Despite being flooded, a few houses survive above the waterline, and there remains a civil parish of Derwent. At the time of the 2001 UK census, it had a population of 51. At the 2011 Census the population remained less than 100. Details were included in the civil parish of Aston, Derbyshire. The most significant surviving reminder of Derwent Village is the village's packhorse bridge, painted in 1925 by the artist Stanley Royle. The bridge was transported and rebuilt at the head of Howden Reservoir at Slippery Stones where it now forms part of the paths and cycle tracks around the Derwent Valley reservoirs. The Derwent Valley Museum, formerly located on the Derwent Reservoir dam and run privately by the late Vic Hallam, told the history of the Derwent valley and of Derwent and Ashopton as well as the tale of RAF Squadron 617 (\\"The Dam Busters\\") and its training for Operation Chastise during the Second World War. There is no formal memorial to any of the villages. However, the site of the construction workers' temporary village when the higher Derwent and Howden Reservoirs were built is clearly marked by a plaque. The only marker of the location of Derwent is the village's War Memorial which stands above Ladybower Reservoir at a point to the west of the village. ==Notable residents== *Charles Balguy was born at Derwent Hall in 1707. ==See also== *List of places in Derbyshire *Capel Celyn (similar village 'drowned' to create a reservoir) ==References External links == *Peeping Tom statue moved from Derwent Hall to Castleton Hall YHA Category:Villages in Derbyshire Category:Towns and villages of the Peak District Category:History of Derbyshire Category:Former populated places in Derbyshire Category:British country houses destroyed in the 20th century Category:Civil parishes in Derbyshire Category:Forcibly depopulated communities in the United Kingdom Category:High Peak, Derbyshire ","title":"Derwent, Derbyshire"},{"id":"5602957","text":"The Miracle Man (Joshua Ayers) is a fictional supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby as one of the first enemies of the Fantastic Four. He was originally depicted as a stage magician with megalomaniacal desires, capable of convincing others through hypnosis that he has amazing powers. In subsequent appearances, he appears to obtain actual, significant superpowers that allow him to mentally control and rearrange matter, but this turns out to be yet another illusion. The Miracle Man becomes one of the many minor Marvel Comics supervillains to be killed by the Scourge of the Underworld, but is resurrected much later by the demon Dormammu (as a parasite of Hood). ==Publication history== The Miracle Man is introduced in Fantastic Four #3 (Mar, 1962) and was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. ==Fictional character biography== Miracle Man is an arrogant stage magician who harbors megalomaniacal desires. The Fantastic Four attend his stage show, and the Miracle Man taunts them during his display of ostensibly superior powers, which includes such feats as levitation, transforming himself into mist, and enlarging himself to giant form. He goads the enraged Thing into an on-stage contest of strength, which he wins as well. Mister Fantastic voices the fear that the team would be unable to defeat him were he to turn to crime. The Miracle Man declares war on humanity and commits a jewel heist, through the aid of a giant prop monster he animates. The police call upon the Fantastic Four to stop him, but the Miracle Man bests them in a series of encounters and hypnotizes the Invisible Girl into obeying him. However, after the Human Torch blinds him with a flare of fire, he is captured easily and his mysterious powers are explained as deriving from nothing more than hypnotism. Later appearances The Miracle Man in Fantastic Four #139 (Oct, 1973), art by John Buscema and Joe Sinnott. The Miracle Man next appears as the villain in a two- issue story arc in Fantastic Four #138-139 (Sept-Oct, 1973). The Fantastic Four encounter him on a remote Indian reservation, while investigating an attack on villages of the tribesmen of Wyatt Wingfoot. They mock him until he demonstrates that he now has actual superpowers, including the ability to control matter and to fire blasts of energy. The Human Torch recounts their first encounter with him to new teammate Medusa, in a flashback that differs significantly from the original story in Fantastic Four #3, with new art and dialogue captioned by the Torch's narration. The team are depicted as having been unimpressed with the stage show until the Thing volunteers to go on stage, where he is attacked by the convincing illusions of a lion and a monster. Their later fights with the Miracle Man are simplified to omit the hypnotism of the Invisible Girl, and to explain that the villain is blinded when the Human Torch destroys the animated prop monster with a single \\"nova flash.\\" The Miracle Man agrees with the Torch's version of their first encounter, and then continues to explain what has subsequently happened to him. He recounts that while in prison, he researched books on the power of \\"mind over matter.\\" After being released, he explains that he sought out a mysterious band of Native Americans known as \\"the Silent Ones,\\" who taught him how to mentally control matter; he had then buried his teachers in a rockslide with his newfound powers. Finished with his story, he causes the earth to open up and swallow the Fantastic Four whole.Fantastic Four #138. Marvel Comics. The Fantastic Four have of course survived, and the story continues with the insane Miracle Man creating his own advanced city to rule, complete with inhabitants under his control. Giant and super-strong, he fights with the Thing in hand-to-hand combat while the other heroes fight his creations. The story shifts to show American military commanders being informed by a \\"professor\\" that \\"some outside force\\" is draining the world's nuclear weapons stockpile of protons, making the weapons unstable and threatening \\"a worldwide nuclear explosion.\\" Before this dire reality comes to pass, the Miracle Man suddenly vanishes in the midst of an arrogant tirade. The Silent Ones serve as a deus ex machina, appearing in the clouds to explain that because they are responsible for his madness, they took him away to \\"cure\\" him.Fantastic Four #139. Marvel Comics. Thing and Ghost Rider team up against the Miracle Man, who has once again overpowered the Silent Ones to escape from their otherworldly imprisonment. After Ghost Rider proves immune to his powers, and the Thing blinds him with a handful of sand, he is reclaimed by the Silent Ones.Marvel Two-In-One #8. Marvel Comics. He subsequently appears in Defenders #120-122, having taken refuge in a monastery after the Silent Ones gave him amnesia. He regains his memories and powers, and steals the \\"Darksoul\\" from Daimon Hellstrom, who had traveled to the monastery on a personal quest for meaning. Now professing a desire to help others, the Miracle Man transports himself and the Defenders to the poverty-stricken island of Java, which he attempts to turn into a paradise. When a blind man refuses to give up his affliction, considering it a divine gift, the Miracle Man is overcome by rage and turns again to violence. Hellstrom regains control over the Darksoul and the Miracle Man loses all of his powers. Miracle Man is on a mission to regain his powers. While aiding the Rhino in a fight against the Thing, the Miracle Man is shot dead by the Scourge of the Underworld.Thing #24. Marvel Comics. The Miracle Man was later among the eighteen criminals, all murdered by the Scourge, to be resurrected by Hood using the power of Dormammu as part of a squad assembled to eliminate the Punisher.Punisher vol. 7 #5. Marvel Comics. He battles the Punisher while posing as a member of the Avengers, and escapes after the fight.Punisher vol. 7 #8. Marvel Comics. ==Powers and abilities== The Miracle Man was a master hypnotist, able to mesmerize others with a glance and then cause them to experience whatever he wished them to.

He received his B.A. in 1814. He began his medical training under William Hartigan and George Stewart, leading Dublin surgeons. He was elected a fellow of the RCSI in 1818 and then went abroad to complete his medical and surgical training. Adams did not take the M.B. degree until 1842. In that year he became an M.D., and in 1861 received the newly-instituted qualification of Master in Surgery. The greater part of Adams' anatomical studies were undertaken in the RCSI under Abraham Colles. In 1816, he obtained the Letters Testimonial, and on 2 November 1818, he was promoted to Membership of the College. He was elected surgeon to the Jervis Street Hospital and the Richmond Hospital. He took part in founding the Richmond Hospital Medical School, later Carmichael School of Medicine and taught there for many years. ==Career== Adams later became three times president of the RCSI and the Dublin Pathological Society, and, in 1862, both Surgeon in Ordinary to the Queen in Ireland, and Regius Professor of Surgery at the University of Dublin. His work focussed on cardiac, respiratory, vascular and joint diseases, and emphasised postmortem examination. His fame chiefly rests on his ‚ÄòTreatise on Rheumatic Gout, or Chronic Rheumatic Arthritis of all the Joints‚Äô (8vo, London, 1857, with an Atlas of Illustrations in 4to; 2nd edition, 1873). This work, though describing a disease more or less known for centuries, contains so much novel and important research as to have become the classical work on the subject. He published a number of important medical texts, including Diseases of the Heart, but it was his work on gout, from which he suffered himself, that made him famous.Langtry, Joe and Nikki Carter, eds.

Of all its former routes, only one, the Tokyo Sakura Tram, remains in service. The Tokyo Metropolitan Bureau of Transportation operates the Toden. The formal legal name is Tokyo-to Densha. Its nickname, \\"Toden,\\" distinguished it from the \\"Kokuden\\" (electrified lines of the Japanese National Railways). ==History== At its peak, the Toden system boasted 41 routes with 213 kilometers of track. However, the increase in reliance on automobile traffic resulted in reductions in ridership, and from 1967 to 1972, 181 km of track were abandoned as the Bureau changed its emphasis to bus and subway modes of transportation. *1903: The Tokyo Horse-drawn Railway changed its motive power to electricity and, under the name Tokyo Electric Railway (or T≈çden, Êù±Èõª) commenced operations between Shinagawa and Shinbashi. *1903: The Tokyo Urban Railway (or Gaitetsu, Ë°óÈâÑ) began operations between Sukiyabashi (in Ginza) and Kandabashi. *1904: The Tokyo Electric Railway (Sotobori Line) connecting Shinbashi Station and Ochanomizu opened. *1905: The three companies published the \\"Tokyo Geography Education Streetcar Song\\" to promote knowledge of the geography of Tokyo. *1906: The three companies merged to form the Tokyo Railways. *1911: Tokyo City purchased the Tokyo Railways, established its Electric Bureau, and inaugurated the Tokyo City Streetcar (Êù±‰∫¨Â∏ÇÈõª) system. *1911‚Äì1922: The streetcar network expands, with various new companies and lines serving areas in the city and to the west. *1933: The route from Shinagawa Station to North Shinagawa Station is abandoned. *1933‚Äì1943: New companies, mergers, and realignments alter the network. *1943: Tokyo City is abolished and the larger Tokyo Prefecture assumes its administrative functions. The Tokyo City Streetcar bureau becomes the Tokyo Metropolitan Bureau of Transportation. *1944: Service is stopped on nine segments. *1945‚Äì1951: During the Occupation of Japan, the network evolved slowly. *1952: The segment of the Imai Line between Higashi Arakawa and Imaibashi Stations was replaced with trolley buses. *1953, 1961: Two segments (one in Shinjuku and the other connecting Shinbashi Station and Shiodome) stop operating. *1963: In preparation for the Tokyo Olympics, two segments (Kita-Aoyama Itchome ‚Äì Miyakezaka and Hanzomon ‚Äì Kudanshita) cease operations. The Suginami Line (Shinjuku ‚Äì Ogikubo) closes because it duplicates a line of the Eidan Subway. *1967‚Äì1972: A plan for financial restructuring is put into effect in seven stages, resulting in the closing of routes. *1974: A plan for abandoning the remaining track is cancelled. The remaining routes are consolidated into a single line, named the Arakawa Line. *1978: One-man operation begins. *1990: The 8500 Series rolling stock is introduced.

Krishna, Arjuna at Kurukshetra, 18th- to 19th- century painting. The horse has been present in the Indian subcontinent from at least the middle of the second millennium BC, more than two millennia after its domestication in Central Asia. The earliest uncontroversial evidence of horse remains on the Indian Subcontinent date to the early Swat culture (around 1600 BCE). Ashva (a Sanskrit word for a horse) is one of the significant animals finding references in several Hindu scriptures. In later periods, the difficulty of breeding large numbers of horses in the Indian climate meant they needed to be imported in large numbers, usually from Central Asia, but also elsewhere. == The horse in Hindu mythology and texts ==  Rigveda  Although the usual assumption has been that the Indo-Aryan migration relied heavily on riders, who may have introduced the domesticated horse to the subcontinent, there are few clear references to actual horse riding in their earliest text, the Rigveda, most clearly in RV 5.61.2-3, describing the Maruts as riders: :Where are your horses, where the reins? How came ye? how had ye the power? Rein was on nose and seat on back. :The whip is laid upon the flank. The heroes stretch their thighs apart, like women when the babe is born. (trans. Griffith) According to RV 7.18.19, Dasyu tribes (the Ajas, Shigrus and Yakshus) also had horses. McDonnell and Keith point out that the Rigveda does not describe people riding horses in battle (see ). This is in accord with the usual dating of the Rigveda to the late Bronze Age, when horses played a role as means of transport primarily as draught animals (while the introduction of cavalry dates to the early Iron Age, possibly an Iranian (specifically Parthian) innovation of around the 9th century BC). RV 1.163.2 mythologically alludes to the introduction of the horse and horseriding: :This Steed which Yama gave hath Trita harnessed, and him, the first of all, hath Indra mounted. :His bridle the Gandharva grasped. O Vasus, from out the Sun ye fashioned forth the Courser. (trans. Griffith)  Yajurveda  The Ashvamedha or horse sacrifice is a notable ritual of the Yajurveda.  Hayagriva  One of the famous avatars of Vishnu, Hayagriva, is depicted with a horse head. Hayagriva is worshipped as the God for Knowledge.  Horse symbolism  Uchchaihshravas, is a seven-headed flying horse. The legend states the first horse emerged from the depth of the ocean during the churning of the oceans. It was a horse with white color and had two wings. It was known by the name of Uchchaihshravas. The legend continues that Indra, one of the gods of the Hindus, took away the mythical horse to his celestial abode, the svarga (heaven). Subsequently, Indra severed the wings of the horse and presented the same to the mankind. The wings were severed to ensure the horse remains on the earth (prithvi) and does not fly back to Indra's suvarga. According to Aurobindo (Secret of the Veda, pp. 44), Asva may not always denote the horse. Aurobindo argued the words asva and asvavati symbolize energy.Aurobindo, Secret of the Veda, (Arya, December 1914) Asva or ratha was also interpreted to be sometimes the \\"psycho-physical complex on which the Atman stands or in which it is seated\\". In another symbolic interpretation based on RV 1.164.2 and Nirukta 4.4.27, asva may also sometimes symbolize the sun.Subhash Kak. Birth and Early Development of Indian Astronomy. In Astronomy across cultures: The History of Non-Western Astronomy, Helaine Selin (ed), Kluwer, 2000 == Archaeology ==  Paleolithic  Remains of the Equus namadicus have been found from Pleistocene levels in India. The Equus namadicus is closely related to the Equus sivalensis. (Note 12. Biswas, S., Rec. GSI, 1988, 118, 53‚Äì62.) The Equus sivalensis lived in the Himalayan foothills in prehistoric times and it is assumed it was extinct during the last Ice Age.  Bronze Age  Remains of horses have been claimed to have been found in deposits at Mahagara near Allahabad (dated to around 2265 BC to 1480 BC, described as Equus ferus caballus Linn), Hallur in Karnataka (c.1500 - 1300 BC, described as Equus ferus caballus), Mohenjo-Daro, Harappa (\\"small horse\\"), LothalS.R. Rao (1985) Lothal - A Harappan Port Town (e.g., a terracotta figurine and a molar horse tooth, dated to 2200 BC), Kalibangan, and Kuntasi (dated to 2300‚Äì1900 BC). Horse remains from the Harappan site Surkotada (dated to 2400-1700 BC) have been identified by A.K. Sharma as Equus ferus caballus. The horse specialist Sandor B√∂k√∂nyi (1997) later confirmed these conclusions and stated the excavated tooth specimens could \\"in all probability be considered remnants of true horses [i.e. Equus ferus caballus]\\". B√∂k√∂nyi stated that \\"The occurrence of true horse (Equus caballus L.) was evidenced by the enamel pattern of the upper and lower cheek and teeth and by the size and form of incisors and phalanges (toe bones).\\". (quoted from B√∂k√∂nyi's letter to the Director of the Archaeological Survey of India, 1993-12-13) However, archaeologists like Meadow (1997) disagree, on the grounds that the remains of the Equus ferus caballus horse are difficult to distinguish from other equid species such as Equus asinus (donkeys) or Equus hemionus (onagers). An alleged clay model of a horse has been found in Mohenjo-Daro and an alleged horse figurine in Periano Ghundai in the Indus Valley., with reference to Mackay 1938 and Piggott 1952 Trautmann (1982) thus remarked the supply and import of horses has \\"always\\" been a preoccupation of the Indians and \\"it is a structure of its history, then, that India has always been dependent upon western and central Asia for horses.\\" The paucity of horse remains could also be explained by India's climatic factors which lead to decay of horse bones. Horse bones may also be rare because horses were probably not eaten or used in burials by the Harappans.S.P. Gupta. The dawn of civilization, in G.C. Pande (ed.)(History of Science, Philosophy and Culture in Indian Civilization, ed., D.P. Chattophadhyaya, vol I Part 1) (New Delhi:Centre for Studies in Civilizations, 1999) Other sites, such as the BMAC complex (which some consider as Indo-Iranian), are at least as poor in horse remains as the Harappan sites.Hastinapura (8th century BCE) is likewise poor in horse remains, even though it is considered as Indo-Aryan. Thapar 1996:21. The theory of Aryan race and India. Social Scientist, Delhi. The horse only appears in Mesopotamia from around 1800 BC as a ridden animal and acquires military significance with the invention of the chariot. Domestication of the horse before the second millennium appears to be confined to its native habitat (the Great Steppe). Colin Renfrew (1999) also remarked, \\"the significance of the horse ... has been much exaggerated\\", and Bryant holds, \\"using such negative evidence, by the same logic used to eliminate India as a candidate, ultimately any potential homeland can be disqualified due to lacking some fundamental Proto-Indo-European item or another\\". Renfrew's statement refers to his own Anatolian hypothesis, which is criticized by mainstream scholarship on similar grounds. In RV 1.162.18, the sacrificial horse is described as having 34 (2x17) ribs: :The four-and-thirty ribs of the Swift Charger, kin to the Gods, the slayer's hatchet pierces. :Cut ye with skill, so that the parts be flawless, and piece by piece declaring them dissect them. (trans. Griffith) Frawley (2005) speculatesFrawley: Myth of Aryan Invasion, 2005 that the Rigvedic horse could, therefore, be the Indian Equus sivalensis (which may or may not have had 34 ribs; modern horses usually have 36, with occasional specimens of 34 or 38). == Horse trade == Horse traders are already mentioned in Atharvaveda 2.30.29.

It is located at Nellis AFB, Nevada. ==Mission== The mission of the USAF Weapons School is to teach graduate-level instructor courses, which provide advanced training in weapons and tactics employment to officers of the combat air forces. The USAF Weapons School is headquartered at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada with detachments at Dyess Air Force Base, Texas, Hurlburt Field, Florida, Little Rock Air Force Base, Arkansas, Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri, Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico, Fairchild Air Force Base, Washington, McChord Field, Washington, and Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana. The Weapons School accomplishes its mission by providing graduate- level, instructor academic and flying courses to USAF Combat Air Forces (CAF) and Mobility Air Forces (MAF). It conducts extensive technical off-station training and is a liaison with CAF and MAF units. It publishes the quarterly USAF Weapons Review with worldwide readership. All positions are selectively manned. The Weapons School's squadrons include the Weapons Instructor Courses for the following aircraft and systems: Air Battle Manager, A-10 Thunderbolt II, Lockheed AC-130, B-1 Lancer, B-2 Spirit, B-52 Stratofortress, C-17 Globemaster III, C-130 Hercules, EC-130H Compass Call, F-15C Eagle, F-15E Strike Eagle, F-16 Fighting Falcon, F-22A Raptor, Joint Terminal Attack Controller, Weapons Director, MQ-9 Reaper, HC-130J Combat King II, HH-60 Pave Hawk, KC-135 Stratotanker, MC-130, RC-135 Rivet Joint, U-2 Dragon Lady, Intelligence, Space, ICBM, Cyber, and Support. ==History==  Origins  USAF Fighter Weapons School F-16 flying with a Constant Peg MiG-21 over the Nevada desert, about 1986 The USAF Weapons School traces its roots to the Aircraft Gunnery School established in 1949 at Las Vegas Air Force Base (which became Nellis Air Force Base in 1950). This organization brought together a cadre of World War II combat veterans dedicated to teaching the next generation of pilots. The Gunnery School converted to combat crew training to meet the needs of the Korean War. In January 1954, the school assumed the mission of training fighter instructors, and took on the title, \\"USAF Fighter Weapons School.\\" Students at Nellis trained in F-51 Mustang. F-80 Shooting Star. F-84 Thunderjet and all versions of the F-100 Super Sabre aircraft during this period. By 1960. the F-100 and the F-105 Thunderchief were left as the two primary aircraft flown at the Weapons School.  Vietnam era  In 1965, the Fighter Weapons School added the F-4 Phantom II to its courses. As the roles of fighter aircraft expanded during the Vietnam War, the Fighter Weapons School began to have an impact across the larger Air Force. Many of the air-to-ground and air-to-air innovations of this period can be traced to the Weapons School. Assigned aircraft continued to change in concert with Air Force inventories. The Weapons School deactivated the F-100 and F-105 courses, and added the F-111 and A-7D Corsair II.  Post‚ÄìVietnam War era  F-15 Division F-15C 82-0038 A-10 Division A-10A 79-0172 F-4 Division F-4D 66-8700 Aggressor Division F-5E 74-1572 F-16 Division F-16C 86-0251 in experimental \\"Aggressor\\" motif The Aggressors, flying the T-38 Talon and F-5E Tiger II were stood-up as part of the Weapons School in the early 1970s to improve air-to- air skills by providing accurate threat replication for dissimilar air combat training. The A-7D tenure in the school was a brief 3 years as the squadron transitioned from A-7s to F-5 Aggressors in 1975. Fighter modernization brought both the A-10 Thunderbolt II and the F-15 Eagle into Weapons School operations in 1977. The 1980s ushered in a time of significant change for the Weapons School. In 1981, the school underwent a complete reorganization as the squadrons became divisions. The Aggressor squadrons transferred to the 57th Fighter Weapons Wing. The F-111 Division became a geographically separated detachment of the Nellis-based Weapons School. The newly formed F-16 Fighting Falcon Division graduated its first students in 1982. In 1984 the Weapons School expanded its courses beyond the traditional fighter aircrew, adding a course to train weapons controllers in the F-15 Division. A passing of the torch to the current Weapons School occurred when the last F-4 class graduated in 1985, ending 20 years of F-4 weapons officer training. The Air Weapons Controller Division, later known as the Command and Control Operations (CCO) Division activated as a separate unit in 1987. The school gained a Fighter Intelligence Officers Course in 1988 which became the graduate patch-awarding Intelligence Division in 1990. The F-15E Strike Eagle Division became part of the school in 1991.  Modern Era  With the stand-up of Air Combat Command in 1992, the school embarked on a dramatic shift from its 43-year focus exclusively on fighter aviation, dropping the \\"fighter\\" from its title and becoming the \\"Air Force Weapons School.\\" The change was much more than symbolic with the activation of the B-52 and B-1 Divisions that year. Rescue helicopters joined the school with the HH-60 Division in 1995 while the F-111 retired. That year also saw the addition of RC-135 RIVET JOINT and EC-130 COMPASS CALL courses to the CCO Division. To increase the graduate-level understanding of space and air integration for operators, the school added the Space Division in 1996. With a growing need for weapons officers skilled at integrating all aspects of air and space power, the Weapons School has continued to expand. 2000 saw the addition of the E-8 JSTARS to the CCO Division. Special Operations Forces (SOF) also became part of the Weapons School in 2000,developing courses for the MH-53 and AC-130 and Stealth joined the school in 2002 with the addition of the F-117 and B-2 Divisions. SOF added an MC-130 course that year as well. In 2003, all of the Weapons School divisions were re-designated (or initially activated) as squadrons, and the Intelligence Sensor Weapons Instructor Course was added to provide graduate- level training in intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance integration. In 2006, the F-117 Weapons Instructor Course deactivated and the merger with the Mobility Weapons School added the C-130, KC-135, and C-17 Weapons Instructor Courses. In 2008, the F-22 joined the Weapons School and in 2009, the ICBM Weapons Instructor Course was added. In 2012, the Cyber Warfare Operations Weapons Instructor Course was founded and joined the space squadron. In 2019, the Weapons School added the U-2 Weapons Instructor Course. Today's Weapons School encompasses 21 squadrons, teaching 24 combat specialties at 9 locations. Only 30% of today's students come from the classic fighter specialties.

He spent five seasons with the team before joining the New York Jets in 1995. He signed with the New England Patriots in 1996, starting nine games, including the playoffs and Super Bowl XXXI loss to the Green Bay Packers. During his first stint with the Patriots, Smith was perhaps best remembered by Patriots fans for recovering a fumble in the 1996 AFC Title Game against the Jaguars. Smith returned it 47 yards for a touchdown which make the score 20-6 and effectively put the game away, pushing the Patriots to their second ever Super Bowl appearance. He rejoined the Jets in 1997 and was re-signed by New England just before the 2000 season. Smith was a contributor to the Patriots winning the Super Bowl XXXVI in 2002, when his interception set up a key field goal against the St. Louis Rams. He retired as a member of the New England Patriots on May 18, 2005. The last team he played for was the Detroit Lions in the 2003 season. ==Coaching career== Smith agreed to join Andy Reid's staff in Philadelphia in January 2008 as an assistant secondary coach for the Eagles. It is similar to a position he held in New England as a member of the Patriots organization as part of the NFL's minority coaching fellowship program. On June 17, 2009, an Eagles spokesperson confirmed that Smith would not be returning as an Eagles assistant for the 2009 season.

As the type species, P. rollianti, was based on insufficient material, the taxonomic status of the genus is in doubt, and other species have been referred to other genera, primarily Boverisuchus. ==History== Pristichampsus was first described and named as a species of Crocodilus, C. rollianti, by Gray in 1831 on the basis of remains from the Lutetian of France. Gervais (1853) assigned this species to its own genus, creating the new combination Pristichampsus rollianti. Other species have been referred to this genus. The genera Boverisuchus and Weigeltisuchus from the Lutetian of Germany as well as Limnosaurus from North America were synonymized with Pristichampsus and their type species were reassigned to it. Langston (1975) found Limnosaurus to be based on non-diagnostic remains, and therefore considered it to be in its own genus, as a nomen dubium. He also reassigned Crocodylus vorax from the Lutetian of Wyoming and West Texas to Pristichampsus. Efimov (1988) named two additional species of Pristichampsus, P. birjukovi and P. kuznetzovi from the Middle Eocene of Eastern Kazakhstan. Following a revision of the genus Pristichampsus by Brochu (2013), P. rollinati was found to be based on insufficiently diagnostic material and therefore is a nomen dubium. Boverisuchus was reinstated as a valid genus, and the species Weigeltisuchus geiseltalensis was considered to be synonymous with B. magnifrons. Brochu (2013) also reassigned P. vorax as the second species of Boverisuchus. According to Brochu (2013), material from the middle Eocene of Italy and Texas may represent other species of Boverisuchus. ==References== Category:Terrestrial crocodylomorphs Category:Paleocene crocodylomorphs Category:Eocene crocodylomorphs Category:Eocene reptiles of North America Category:Eocene reptiles of Asia Category:Eocene reptiles of Europe Category:Fossil taxa described in 1853 Category:Nomina dubia ","title":"Pristichampsus"},{"id":"5603077","text":"St Newlyn East church Cargoll Farm St Newlyn East () is a civil parish and village in Cornwall, England, United Kingdom. The village is approximately three miles (5 km) south of Newquay.Ordnance Survey: Landranger map sheet 200 Newquay & Bodmin The name St Newlyn East is locally abbreviated to Newlyn East and according to an anonymous historian writing in The Cornishman in 1880 it was only in recent years that Saint had been added to the parish name. The parish is named after the patron saint of the church, St Newlina, and the population was 1,390 in the 2001 census, which had increased to 1,635 at the 2011 census. There is also an electoral ward named Newlyn and Goonhavern which following the 2011 census had a population of 4,933. The Lappa Valley Steam Railway tourist attraction operates near Newlyn East. At Trerice is the Tudor mansion of the Arundells now in the care of the National Trust. To the northeast is Tresillian House. The village has a primary school. ==Church of St Newlina and the Manor of Cargoll== The church was founded in Norman times and rededicated in 1259. Most of the present building is of the 14th and 15th centuries. There is a fine Norman font.Pevsner, N. (1970) Cornwall; 2nd ed. Penguin Books; p. 199 The mutilated head of a medieval lantern cross was found buried in the churchyard in 1959.

(2002) Stone Crosses in Mid Cornwall; 2nd ed. Federation of Old Cornwall Societies; pp. 59‚Äì60 Cargoll Farm Barn is a listed 15th century barn which belonged to the manor of Cargoll. The manor was recorded in the Domesday Book (1086); it was then held by Robert, Count of Mortain, from Bodmin Monastery. There were two hides of land and land for 15 ploughs. The lord held land for 3 ploughs with 16 serfs, and 16 villeins and 22 smallholders had land for 6 ploughs. There was also a mill which paid 2/6, 4 acres of woodland and 2 square leagues of pasture. The livestock was 12 mares, 7 cattle, 7 pigs, 60 sheep and 12 goats. The value of the manor was ¬£3 sterling though it had formerly been worth ¬£10.Thorn, C. et al., ed. (1979) Cornwall. Chichester: Phillimore; entry 4,10 This manor and the advowson of the church were purchased by Walter Branscombe (Bishop of Exeter) in 1269 from the Valletorts. The lands of the manor were extensive and it is likely that the bishop's palace within the manor was at Lanner in the parish of St Allen, rather than at Cargoll itself. In 1283 the manor was appropriated by Bishop Peter Quivel to the chancellorship of the cathedral and thereafter several generous gifts were made to the church by the chancellors.Cornish Church Guide (1925) Truro: Blackford; p. 171 At Cargoll a fair and annual market were held from the year 1311 onwards.Samantha Letters, \\"Gazetteer of Markets and Fairs in England and Wales to 1516: Cornwall\\" ==East Wheal Rose disaster== On 9 July 1846 a disaster at the East Wheal Rose mine was caused by an unusually heavy thunderstorm which flooded the mine. Thirty- nine of the miners (mainly inhabitants of the village and its immediate vicinity) were drowned. The mine eventually closed in 1886. The St. Newlyn East Pit was already in existence at the time of the mining disaster and was used by a local preacher to preach sermons, as it provided shelter when the weather was inclement. It was originally an abandoned quarry and was also used for Cornish wrestling. After the mining disaster, the pit was graded into tiers and dedicated to the memory of those who died in the disaster. It was restored with the aid of lottery funds in about 2003. More recently, the lease was taken over by the Parish Council and a new Management Committee formed to manage and promote the use of the Pit. ==St. Newlyn East Wartime Weekend== A waymarking stone by the roadside St Newlyn East is known for the annual St Newlyn East Wartime Weekend which takes place at the village recreational field and village hall. ==Notable people== Mary Watson, born at Fiddlers' Green, near St Newlyn East, emigrated to Australia. She was 21 years old and had been married less than eighteen months when she died of thirst on No. 5 Island in the Howick Group off Cape Flattery in the north of Queensland, Australia, in 1881. ==ReferencesExternal links== * * Newlyn East; Vision of Britain * Cargoll; Domesday map Category:Civil parishes in Cornwall Category:Villages in Cornwall Category:Disasters in Cornwall ","title":"St Newlyn East"},{"id":"5603080","text":"A face book or facebook is a common or web directory found at some American universities consisting of individuals‚Äô photographs and names.

Born in Derry, County Londonderry, Ireland, Willman died aged 70 in New York City, United States. Willman's films included The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956), Carve Her Name with Pride (1958), The Kiss of the Vampire (1963), Doctor Zhivago (1965), The Reptile (1966), and The Odessa File (1974). He was also a theatre director and actor, and won a Tony Award in 1962 for his direction of the original Broadway production of Robert Bolt's A Man For All Seasons. According to Bolt, he was instrumental in many aspects of the play's development, including the casting of Paul Scofield as Thomas More. In 1966 he was nominated in the same category for James Goldman's The Lion in Winter. He later directed Katharine Hepburn and Christopher Reeve in A Matter of Gravity in 1976. He frequently collaborated with Bolt, directing The Tiger and the Horse and Gentle Jack (and appearing in Zhivago, which Bolt scripted). One of his most famous theatrical roles was opposite Alec Guinness in the stage production of Bridget Boland's The Prisoner, for which he won the Clarence Derwent Award, and which was later made into a film, starring Guinness and Jack Hawkins. Willman studied for the stage at the London Theatre Studio which had been set up by Michel St Denis and George Devine in 1935. Working as stage manager for John Gielgud's touring production of The Beggar's Opera, he took over the role of Macheath at short notice from Michael Redgrave, who and fallen ill and whose usual understudy had suffered a bout of laryngitis.\\"Success of Young Derryman\\", Londonderry Journal, 29 February 1940. During the war he toured with the Old Vic Company, then directed by Tyrone Guthrie, playing in The Merchant of Venice in 1941, and taking part in several productions at the Vic's Liverpool Playhouse base, including Shaw's Androcles and the Lion. Prompted by Guthrie, he became a director. In 1942, he presented his debut production Ah, Wilderness! by Eugene O'Neill. ==Filmography== { border=\\"2\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font- size: 90%;\\" - bgcolor=\\"#CCCCCC\\" align=\\"center\\" !

In 1319 a petition raised by the patron of the church, Sir John Trejagu, was granted by the Bishop of Exeter, Walter de Stapledon; to create a collegiate church by building a chantry for four chaplains. At the time of its restoration by George Street in the 19th century, the church was cruciform with a western tower and south porch. It was re-opened for services on Christmas Eve, 1865.

Ratha (Proto- Indo-Iranian: *Hr√°t ∞as, Sanskrit: ‡§∞‡§•, ', Avestan: raŒ∏a) is the Indo-Iranian term for a spoked-wheel chariot or a cart of antiquity. ==Textual evidence== Rama goes to forest on a ratha. Chariots figure prominently in the Rigveda, evidencing their presence in India in the 2nd millennium BCE. Notably, the Rigveda differentiates between the Ratha (chariot) and the Anas (often translated as \\"cart\\").A discussion of the difference between ratha and anas is found e.g. in Kazanas, Nicholas. 2001. The AIT and Scholarship Rigvedic chariots are described as made of the wood of Salmali (RV 10.85.20), Khadira and Simsapa (RV 3.53.19) trees. While the number of wheels varies, chariot measurements for each configuration are found in the Shulba Sutras. Chariots also feature prominently in later texts, including the other Vedas, the Puranas and the great Hindu epics (Ramayana and Mahabharata). Indeed, most of the deities in the Hindu pantheon are portrayed as riding them. Among Rigvedic deities, notably Ushas (the dawn) rides in a chariot, as well as Agni in his function as a messenger between gods and men. In RV 6.61.13, the Sarasvati river is described as being wide and speedy, like a (Rigvedic) chariot. ==History== Indus Valley Civilization The Indus Valley Civilization sites of Daimabad and Harappa in the Indian subcontinent, there is evidence for the use of terracotta model carts as early as 3500 BC during the Ravi Phase. During the Harappan Period (Harappa Phase, 2600‚Äì1900 BC) there was a dramatic increase in terracotta cart and wheel types at Harappa and other sites throughout the Indus region. The diversity in carts and wheels, including depictions of what may be spoked wheels, during this period of urban expansion and trade may reflect different functional needs, as well as stylistic and cultural preferences. The unique fonns and the early appearance of carts in the Indus valley region suggest that they are the result of indigenous technological development and not diffusion from West Asia or Central Asia as proposed by earlier scholars. Proto-Indo-Iranians The area of the spoke-wheeled chariot finds within the Sintashta-Petrovka culture is indicated in purple. The chariot must not necessarily be regarded as a marker for Indo-European or Indo-Iranian presence.Cf. Raulwing 2000 According to Raulwing, it is an undeniable fact that only comparative Indo-European linguistics is able to furnish the methodological basics of the hypothesis of a \\"PIE chariot\\", in other words: \\"Ausserhalb der Sprachwissenschaft winkt keine Rettung!I. e., \\"Outside of linguistics there's no hope.\\"\\"Raulwing 2000:83Cf. Henri Paul Francfort in Fussman, G.; Kellens, J.; Francfort, H.-P.; Tremblay, X. (2005), p. 272-276 The earliest evidence for chariots in southern Central Asia (on the Oxus) dates to the Achaemenid period (apart from chariots harnessed by oxen, as seen on petroglyphs).They were not used for warfare. H. P. Francfort, Fouilles de Shortugai, Recherches sur L'Asie Centrale Protohistorique Paris: Diffusion de Boccard, 1989, p. 452. Cf. Henri Paul Francfort in Fussman, G.; Kellens, J.; Francfort, H.-P.; Tremblay, X. (2005), p.272 No Andronovian chariot burial has been found south of the Oxus.H. P. Francfort in Fussman, G.; Kellens, J.; Francfort, H.-P.; Tremblay, X. (2005), p. 220 - 272; H.-P. Francfort, Fouilles de Shortugai Remains The Rath Jatra in the Grand Avenue at the Jagannath Temple, Puri, 2007. There are a few depictions of chariots among the petroglyphs in the sandstone of the Vindhya range. Two depictions of chariots are found in Morhana Pahar, Mirzapur district. One shows a team of two horses, with the head of a single driver visible. The other one is drawn by four horses, has six-spoked wheels, and shows a driver standing up in a large chariot-box. This chariot is being attacked, with a figure wielding a shield and a mace standing at its path, and another figure armed with bow and arrow threatening its right flank. It has been suggested (Sparreboom 1985:87) that the drawings record a story, most probably dating to the early centuries BC, from some center in the area of the Ganges-Yamuna plain into the territory of still neolithic hunting tribes. The drawings would then be a representation of foreign technology, comparable to the Arnhem Land Aboriginal rock paintings depicting Westerners. The very realistic chariots carved into the Sanchi stupas are dated to roughly the 1st century. The earliest Copper-bronze age chariot remains that have been found in India (at Sinauli) have been dated to 1900BCE.There is evidence of wheeled vehicles (especially miniature models) in the Indus Valley Civilization, but not of chariots.Bryant 2001 Indus valley sites have offered several instances of evidence of spoked wheels. Archaeologist B. B. LalThe Sarasvati Flows on, 2002, pp. 74‚Äì75, Figs 3.28 to 331 argues that finds of terracotta wheels painted lines (or low relief lines) and similar seals indicate the existence and use of spoked wheel chariots in Harappan Civilization, as showed in the Bhirrana excavations in 2005‚Äì06.L.S.Rao, Harappan Spoked Wheels Rattled Down the Streets of Bhirrana, Dist. Fatehabad, Haryana Bhagwan SinghHarappan Civilization and the Vedic Literature, in Hindi, 1987 had made a similar assertion and S.R. Rao had presented evidence of chariots in bronze models from Daimabad (Late Harappan). The archaeologists at Daimabad are not unanimous about the date of the bronzes discovered there. On the basis of the circumstantial evidence, M. N. Deshpande, S. R. Rao and S. A. Sali are of view that these objects belong to the Late Harappan period. Looking at the analysis of the elemental composition of these artifacts, D. P. Agarwal concluded that these objects may belong to the historical period. His conclusion is based on these objects containing more than 1% arsenic, while no arsenical alloying has been found in any other Chalcolithic artifacts. == In Hindu temple festivals == Ratha or Rath means a chariot or car made from wood with wheels. The Ratha may be driven manually by rope, pulled by horses or elephants. Rathas are used mostly by the Hindu temples of South India for Rathoutsava (Car festival). During the festival, the temple deities are driven through the streets, accompanied by the chanting of mantra, hymns, shloka or bhajan. Ratha Yatra is a huge Hindu festival associated with Lord Jagannath held at Puri in the state of Orissa, India during the months of June or July.

The most known are the Pancha Rathas (=5 rathas) in Mahabalipuram, although not with the shape of a chariot. Another example is the Jaga mohan of the Konark Sun Temple in Konar√¢k, built on a platform with twelve sculptures of wheels, as a symbol of the chariot of the Sun.

The first Europeans to explore and traverse through the district were Dr George Imlay and John Hill on 24 January 1838.The Australian, 27 March 1838, p.3. In 1839, the South Australia Company took up a parcel of land, on which the settlements of Gumeracha, Kenton Valley and Forreston developed. The company established a district headquarters and opened it up for sheep grazing. In 1839, William Beavis Randell built his home, Tinmath, at Kenton Park and built a flour mill in the 1840s.Adelaide Hills Online - Gumeracha Accessed 16 June 2006. The estate housed his large family, his workforce and their families. In 1846, Randell donated land and funds for a church, and the Salem Baptist Church was built - the oldest Baptist church still in use in South Australia. The surrounding area, meanwhile, had become an agricultural centre, and the Gumeracha Farmers' Society held annual shows. In 1853 the District Council of Talunga was established to administer the Hundred of Talunga including in large part the early Adelaide Hills pioneering community that would become Gumeracha. In 1855, Randell allocated land for a township and by 1860 the town was laid out. Commercial businesses sprang up on the main street (Albert Street), and many fine buildings were erected, including the Post Office, Police Station & Court House (1864), Institute Hall, Town Hall (1909), a butter factory (1889), a school, a hospital, a coach-house, hotels, churches and business houses. Most of the buildings in use at this time still stand today. William Beavis Randell's son, William Richard Randell, would build the first Murray River paddlesteamer in Gumeracha in 1852. In 1935, the District Council of Gumeracha replaced Talunga council to administer a broader area around the town, centred at Gumeracha, the main point of population in that part of the Adelaide Hills. ==Geography== Gumeracha is located between Inglewood and Birdwood along the Adelaide-Mannum Road, and north of Lobethal along the Gumeracha-Lobethal Road.

He was seen as a potential professional player from a young age as his height made him stand out on the football field. He won the junior football league's Best and Fairest award at under 14s level. He was touted as a potential number one draft pick. However, a torn calf muscle did not allow him to perform to his full potential at the AFL draft camp and as a result Nick Riewoldt was selected as the number one pick. McDougall was recruited as the number 5 draft pick in the 2000 AFL Draft from Perth. ==Career at the West Coast Eagles== McDougall made his debut for the West Coast Eagles in Round 22, 2002 against the Kangaroos in Canberra. He was plagued by injuries and indifferent form, and was much maligned by West Coast supporters for being an underachieving talent. 2004 was McDougall's best season at West Coast, in which he kicked 35 goals from 21 games. This included a four-goal haul against then-Brisbane Lions defender Mal Michael at the Gabba before half time. McDougall was selected in round 1, 2005 despite a shoulder injury limiting his pre-season. He re-injured the shoulder early in the game and was sidelined until round 16. He only managed one AFL game in 2006, forcing his way into the team after a string of good performances in the WAFL, only to be dropped after West Coast's defeat to Collingwood. At the end of the 2006 season West Coast offered McDougall a one-year contract, but due to lack of opportunities at the club he opted to be traded to the Western Bulldogs who had shown an interest in McDougall over the past few years. ==Career at the Western Bulldogs== On day four of the 2006 Trade Week, a deal was struck between the Western Bulldogs and West Coast. The Eagles received the Western Bulldogs' second and fourth round draft picks in exchange for McDougall, and the Eagles owned second and fourth round picks. Before the 2007 season commenced, Western Bulldogs coach Rodney Eade said the additions of new recruits Andrew McDougall and Jason Akermanis would make the team genuine premiership chances over the next three years. He played five games for the Bulldogs in his short career. McDougall's best game was against Hawthorn in round 21 where he received four votes in the Bulldogs' 2007 Best and Fairest Award. The cult following he generated among some Bulldogs fans was highlighted by the standing ovation he received when Master of Ceremonies Craig Willis announced the votes. However, McDougall was unable to break into the Bulldogs team the following season and announced his retirement from the club on 17 July 2008.http://news.realfooty.com.au/sport/bulldogs-mcdougall-quits- afl-20080717-3gq1.html ==Post-AFL career== After retiring from the AFL, McDougall returned home to WA, playing for Perth and Subiaco in the WAFL from 2010 to 2013.

The Fifth Empire (Portuguese: Quinto Imp√©rio) is a concept of a global Portuguese empire with spiritual and temporal power, based on an interpretation of Daniel 2 and the Book of Revelation, whose origins lay with Ant√≥nio Vieira. The concept was re- popularized in the twentieth century with the publication of Mensagem by Fernando Pessoa in 1934. == The concept == The Fifth Empire is not a mere territorial empire. It is a spiritual and linguistic body which spreads throughout the entire world. It represents the ultimate form of fusion between material (science, reason, intellectual speculation) and spiritual knowledge: the occult, mystical speculation and Kabbalism. It is the pinnacle of all the work undertaken by the previous empires (according to old principle of the translatio imperii), which are the following under Pessoa's point of view: * First Empire - Ancient Greece, all knowledge and experience extracted from the ancient empires; * Second Empire - Roman Empire, expansion of the First Empire's culture and knowledge; * Third Empire - Christianity, fusion between the First and the Second Empires, with the absorption of several eastern elements (such as Judaism) - the Christian Moral; * Fourth Empire - Europe, spreading throughout the entire world the outcome of the previous empires and the Anglo-Saxon hegemony, its culture and the English-speaking world as a result of the British Empire - the English individualism. The Fifth Empire, led by \\"the hidden one\\" (O Encoberto in the poem, an allusion to Sebastianism), will unite the entire world spiritually and culturally, led by the Portuguese Nation. == Origins == The Fifth Empire is a belief messianic, millenarian (quili√°stica), designed by Father Ant√≥nio Vieira in the seventeenth century. The first four empires were, according to Vieira, in order: the Assyro-Caldeans, the Persians, the Greeks and the Romans. The fifth was the Portuguese Empire. As seen when viewing the book of Daniel 2, in the Hebrew scriptures (Old Testament), in Bible, Father Ant√≥nio Vieira came to this myth based on a biblical passage that tells the story of King Nebuchadnezzar and his dream, with a statue that featured five kinds of materials. The origins of the myth of the Fifth Empire are intimately connected with the History of Portugal. The death of King Sebastian and subsequent loss of independence were disastrous for the country and its colonial ambitions. The restoration of independence in 1640 did, however, give a new hope for the entire nation. Father Ant√≥nio Vieira, in many of his works and sermons, would present John IV as the saviour, who would restore the grandiosity of the Portuguese Empire, leader of the Age of Discovery, and succeed to the four empires of ancient History (Vieira's past empires did not coincide with those advocated by Pessoa and mentioned above). As for the Fifth Monarchists later in England and other authors, although with some differences, Vieira, with an elaborate exegesis based on his vast knowledge of the Bible, believed that the timing was significant because the calendar year 1666 was approaching. The number 666 had been identified in the Book of Revelation with the ultimate human despot to rule the world, but who would be replaced by the second coming of the Messiah; this added to his belief that the Fifth Monarchy was possibly about to begin. Gon√ßalo Anes Bandarra, the 16th century shoemaker turned prophet whom interpreters credit with foretelling accurately the coming of a period of 60 years when Portugal was under Spanish rule, the subsequent 1640 revolution and liberation under king John IV (after thirty scissors) and the reigns of Afonso VI, Peter II and John V, was an inspired prophet to Ant√≥nio Vieira and the Sebastianists of his time. His work also aroused interest especially among the new Christians. Bandarra had a vast knowledge from the Old Testament and his prophetic Trovas would also be subject to analysis and inspiration for Fernando Pessoa. In his poem \\"Mensagem\\", a book so thoroughly steeped in Templar and Rosicrucian symbolism in his own words, Pessoa reveals himself as the author of the third and final warning, which complements the two previous ones, of Bandarra and Vieira. From the 17th century on, and as the Portuguese Empire slowly crumbled, the dream became increasingly more mystical. Greater importance was given to Lu√≠s de Cam√µes and his masterpiece, Os Lus√≠adas, which exalted Portugal as a nation of heroes aided by the classical gods. == Pessoa == The third cycle of \\"Mensagem\\", called O Encoberto (\\"The Hidden One\\") refers to Fernando Pessoa's vision of a future world of peace and understanding, the Fifth Empire, which will come about through a Portuguese of mystical origin to which he refers by a number of names including \\"The Hidden One\\", \\"The King\\" or \\"King Sebastian\\". The Hidden One represents the fulfillment of the destiny of mankind, designed by God since before Time, and, at the same time, the accomplishment of Portugal which, in Pessoa's vision is the chosen nation, the one that will bear the New Messiah and lead the way towards the Fifth Empire: :\\"There will be a meeting of the two long separated forces, but long approaching: the left side of wisdom - i.e. science, reasoning, intellectual speculation, and the right side of wisdom - that is, the hidden knowledge, intuition, the kabbalistic and mystical speculation. The alliance of D. Sebastian, Emperor of the World, and the Angelic Pope, figure this close alliance, this fusion of the material and the spiritual, perhaps without separation. And the very Second Advent, or even the new incarnation of the same Adept, whom once God has designed His symbol, or Son, seems to show otherwise this same supreme alliance.\\" According to Pessoa \\"The Fifth Empire. Portugal's future - which I do not reckon, but I know - it is already written, for those who know how to read it, in the Bandarra's Trovas, and also in quatrains of Nostradamus\\". In The Prophecies of Nostradamus, Fernando Pessoa probably makes reference to the Tenth and last Century, including the Fifth quatrain and the last of all quatrains of this century, among many others in Nostradamus's Centuries. In Pessoa's vision, lusophone countries such as Brazil, have a key role in this mission, supported by the Portuguese international alliances, including the Iberian nations, Britain, Ireland, the Atlantism, Greece and its legacy, and beyond. == See also == * Cult of the Holy Spirit * Fifth Monarchists == References == Category:Portuguese mythology Category:Monarchism in Portugal ","title":"Fifth Empire"},{"id":"5603190","text":"thumb Tregony, the main street looking north east Cuby () is a civil parish and village in Cornwall, England, United Kingdom, situated approximately 7 miles (12 km) southwest of St Austell.Ordnance Survey: Landranger map sheet 204 Truro & Falmouth Cornelly parish was united with Cuby in 1934.

The scheme has been orchestrated by The Ladock and Grampound Road Transition group. The group today consists of around fifty active members and was set up in 2008 by people within the community concerned about socioeconomic and environmental issues such as climate change, the rising cost of oil and population growth. In 2009, the transition group submitted an application for a nationwide government grant which they subsequently won. The grant of ¬£500,000 was given to twelve varying communities across England and Wales to find out how small-scale communities could reduce carbon emissions from the bottom up. The communities are acting as test-beds for achieving sustainable living on a community-wide scale. In 2010 the villages together were named Cornwall Sustainable Village of the Year and awarded an additional ¬£1,000 first prize to be invested in the community. The transition group encompassing the two villages has been praised for its high scores in five categories ‚Äì local economy, village amenities, renewable energy and reducing environmental impact, plans for the future and the buzz factor. As of early 2011, the project had completed the installation of carbon-reduction measures in sixteen homes (with varying housing types, age and occupancy), two schools, six local businesses and two community halls. Measures include heat pumps, biomass boilers, solar photovoltaic and solar thermal panels, as well the installation of dry lining and insulation in many properties. In addition, smart meters have been installed in participating properties to assist the monitoring of the behavioural change activities. The overall aim of the scheme is to deliver a reduction of 33% to the current carbon emission, equating to a saving of 123 tonnes of CO2 a year. In the wider community, a carbon sequestration project has seen the planting of fruit and nut trees and 5-acre allotments site to naturally absorb and hold carbon while providing a boost to local food production. A community owned 20k wind turbine has also be installed. The generation of energy by means of renewables will be sold back to the National Grid, with money being generated via the government‚Äôs adoption of Feed-in tariffs. A community managed fund will be set up to ensure that income made by electricity generating aspects of the scheme remain a rolling resource that will benefit the wider community. Income from feed-in tariffs and anticipated Renewable Heat Incentives from the government will be reinvested in more carbon saving measures so that the benefits of the programme of will far exceed the initial targets of the project. ==Historic estates== *Trethurffe, Ladock ==References== Old Methodist church of Ladock, now a house ==External links== Category:Villages in Cornwall Category:Civil parishes in Cornwall ","title":"Ladock"},{"id":"5603207","text":"Mylor Creek Mylor is a civil parish in Cornwall, England, United Kingdom.

Perranzabuloe parish is bordered to the west by the Atlantic coast and St Agnes parish, to the north by Cubert parish, to the east by St Newlyn East and St Allen parishes and to the south by Kenwyn parish. The hamlet (containing the parish church) is situated just over a mile (2 km) south of the principal settlement of the parish, Perranporth; the hamlet is also seven miles (11 km) south-southwest of Newquay.Ordnance Survey: Landranger map sheet 204 Truro & Falmouth Ordnance Survey: Landranger map sheet 200 Newquay & Bodmin Other settlements in the parish include Perrancoombe, Goonhavern, Mount and Callestick.Ordnance Survey: Explorer Map 104 Redruth & St Agnes The parish population was 5,382 in the 2001 census, increasing to 5,486 at the 2011 census. The name of the parish derives from the medieval Latin Perranus in Sabulo meaning Piran in the sand. It refers to Saint Piran (the patron saint of Cornwall) who founded an oratory church in the seventh century near the coast north of Perranporth. In medieval times the parish of Perranzabuloe was a peculiar of Exeter Cathedral. Perranzabuloe at that time exercised ecclesiastic control of St Agnes: the latter's church was a chapelry of Perranzabuloe. In 1846 St Agnes became a separate ecclesiastical parish. ==Churches== St Piran's Oratory and Old Church St Piran's CrossRemains of the old parish church The site of the oratory of St Piran is in the extensive sand dunes known as Penhale Sands. Legend has it that St Piran landed on Perran beach from his native Ireland and built the oratory in the Irish style. The first oratory was probably built of wattle and daub and replaced in stone at a later date. The oratory was very simple in plan and was barely long. Local community groups have established a fund for re-excavation of the site which began in early 2014. Three carved stone 'Celtic' heads, of a man, woman, and cat are in the care of the Royal Cornwall Museum. The encroachment of the sand led to the oratory's abandonment in the 10th century. The noted 17th-century antiquary Richard Carew wrote: When the oratory was abandoned, another church (now known as St Piran's Old Church, ) was built nearby on the inland side of the stream. As mentioned by Carew (above) it was thought the stream would protect the church from encroachment by sand. This proved to be the case for several hundred years and the church, completed by the 12th century, was enlarged in 1462. However, mining for tin caused the stream to dry up and eventually the church was engulfed by the dunes. The last service was held in 1795 after which the old church was partially dismantled and the materials used to build a new church inland. However, the old church's graveyard was used for burials until 1835 before sand enveloped it. The Oratory in 1952 under a protective shell that was built before the sand was allowed to rebury it The oratory site was excavated in 1910 but the remains of the stone building are now buried in the sand again. The site of St Piran's Old Church and the 10th century cross next to it was excavated in 1919.Pevsner, N. (1970) Cornwall; 2nd ed., edited by Enid Radcliffe. Penguin Books St Piran's Cross (believed to be the earliest recorded stone cross in Cornwall) stands in the dunes between the oratory site and the graveyard of the old church. It is dedicated to tinners and miners and stands high. Arthur Langdon suggested that the shaft had once been ornamented but the ornament had not survived because of the poor quality of the granite.Langdon, A. G. (1896) Old Cornish Crosses. Truro: Joseph Pollard; pp. 180-82 In Saxon times there was also a monastery (known as Lanpiran or Lamberran) near the oratory site but it was disendowed c1085 by Robert of Mortain. The relics of St Piran were preserved in St Piran Old Church which became a centre of pilgrimage. The relics are recorded in an inventory made in 1281 and were still venerated in the reign of Queen Mary I according to Nicholas Roscarrock's account. Parish Church The parish church of St Piran The present parish church is situated in Perranzabuloe hamlet at . It was dedicated to St Piran in July 1805. Much of the structure is built of materials retrieved from St Piran's Old Church. Perranzabuloe church has a chancel and nave, a south aisle, and north and south transepts. One of the aisles is known as the Chyverton aisle and housed a pew belonging to the notable local family. The three-stage tower is battlemented, pinnacled and houses a ring of three bells. On 5 August 1878 there was a service by the Bishop of Truro, to re-open the church following a renovation with new pews and a ‚Ä≥wagon-headed‚Ä≥ roof for the chancel, to divide it from the nave. ==St Piran's Day events== St Piran's Day is celebrated on 5 March. The main event in the parish is a march across the dunes to St Piran's Cross. Thousands of people attend, generally dressed in black, white and gold, and carrying Saint Piran's Flag, generally known as the flag of Cornwall. A play of the Life of St Piran, spoken in Cornish, has been enacted in recent years at the event. Daffodils are also carried and placed at the cross. In October every year Perranporth hosts the annual inter-Celtic festival of 'Lowender Peran' which is also named in honour of St Piran. Perran Feast is traditionally celebrated in Perranzabuloe Parish on the last Monday in October by Perranzabuloe Old Cornwall Society. On the Sunday before, both the Old Cornwall Society and the Anglican Church in Perranzabuloe parish commemorate St Piran. There is a pilgrimage to the site of St Piran's Oratory in the afternoon and a service in the parish church of St Piran in the evening. ==Chiverton== Batters' Shaft, West Chiverton mine Southwest of Zelah but in Perranzabuloe parish is Chyverton House and its grounds.Ordnance Survey (1961) One-inch Map of Great Britain; Truro and Falmouth, sheet 190 Nearby was a notable lead mine called West Chiverton Mine which produced 45,100 tons of lead ore in the period 1859‚Äì86. There were seven more less successful mines which also included \\"Chiverton\\" in their names.Barton, D. B. (1965) A Guide to the Mines of West Cornwall; 2nd ed. Truro: D. Bradford Barton; pp. 49‚Äì50 West Chiverton Mine had an 80-inch pumping engine; in 1870 it had a workforce of 1000 and a main shaft over 700 ft deep but the mine closed in 1886.Todd, A.

Six museum specimens of this species are known, two of which have been misidentified as the pygmy tarsier before their correct identity came out. This species has been named after the Lariang River, an important river in the part of Sulawesi where this species occurs. This species has darker fur than the other Sulawesi tarsiers. The dorsal fur is greyish brown. The blackish tail ends in a dark pencil-like point. There is a clearly discernible dark ring around the eyes. The third digit on the hands is very long. It's the second largest tarsier; only the Sangihe tarsier is larger; published body weights are 67 to 117 g. == Description == The Lariang Tarsier (T. lariang) is portrayed by its dark grey- buff pelage, thick black pencil-like tail, finely marked black paranasal stripes, along with the form of black eye rims that distinguish it from its neighbor to the east (Tarsius dianae). They are missing brown tones on their thighs and have a small bald spot at the base of their ear. To determine them from other Sulawesi mainland tarsiers they are distinguished to have a longer third middle finger. However, it is also the largest of the Sulawesi tarsiers. == Distribution == The distribution of T. lariang is either allopatric or parapatric with no occurrence of the species being sympatric. They are found only on the eastern Indonesian island of Sulawesi. Their range includes from Palu Bay to Makassar Strait to Lore-Lindu National Park. Populations of T. lariang occur on both sides of the Lariang River. It mostly inhabits the northern part of Western Sulawesi while bordering its congener Tarsius dentatus along the Palu-Koro fault. This species is strictly endemic to the regions of Central and West Sulawesi. == Etymology == The species scientific name Tarsius lariang translates to Lariang Tarsier. The name was given to the species because of their distribution along the landmark of the Lariang River in Sulawesi. The river Lariang is a major study region for this species of tarsier. == Diet == The Lariang Tarsiers are obligate faunivores with the main part of their diet consisting of insects. They would be considered strictly insectivores if it weren't for their occasional interest in eating lizards such as house geckos, snakes, birds, and even bats. Crickets make up most of the tarsiers diet because of their great abundance and availability. Tarsiers are known to consume about 10% of their body weight daily, which translates to around 15.4 g of food per day. They do prefer a more varied diet. Scientists have found that if fed crickets for a long period of time they start to reject them and seek a different prey item. Their preference of a prey item increases as the availability of the item decreases. Tarsiers usually ambush their prey on the forest floors with vertical perches of about 0.5-1.0 m high. They tend to catch prey items that could more easily escape first, leaving the easier catch for last. They are nocturnal so the majority of their hunting occurs at night. == Reproduction and social groups == Lariang tarsiers have a monogamous or facultative polygamous social system. Extrapair mating is assumed to be used to avoid interbreeding. Adult males and females often pair and mate for life, but the male will often leave later on and this involves extrapair mating. They tend to live in small groups and exhibit social and territorial behaviors. Social groups tend to share the same sleeping sites and have a vocal system of daily duet calls within their groups. Social groups are usually composed of one adult male, one adult female along with their offspring. All species of tarsiers have a gestation period of around six months or about 190 days. Females usually consume double their body weight around the third trimester. They give birth to only one young that are born with fur and their eyes open already. They can also climb right after they are born. Tarsiers are among the largest mammals when newborn, relative to their mother's body size. == Phylogeny == The tarsier lineage is known to have split from other primate lineages around 58 mya, but it could very well be much earlier. Scientists have discovered Tarsiid fossils from Asia dating from the Eocene to the Miocene. Multivariate analyses have shown the T. lariang is significantly distinct from other species of Sulawesi tarsiers. The isolation of the Sulawesi islands archipelago (before they became one big island), due to a period of plate tectonic activity about 20 mya resulted in speciation of the species of Sulawesi tarsiers. Lariang tarsiers most likely colonized Sulawesi region around the Miocene. Scientists have found that the estimated split between T. dentatus and T. lariang to have taken place around 1.4 mya. == References == Lariang tarsier Category:Endemic fauna of Indonesia Category:Mammals of Sulawesi Category:Primates of Indonesia Lariang tarsier ","title":"Lariang tarsier"},{"id":"5603256","text":"This is an incomplete list of statutory codes from the U.S. states, territories, and the one federal district.

Condemned as a \\"rightist\\" during the Anti-Rightist Campaign in 1957, he spent 20 years in the laogai (\\"reform through labor\\") camps. Following his release in 1978, he published China's first novel on laogai and founded the \\"High Wall Literature\\" genre that depicts the traumas suffered by political prisoners in the labor camps. Highly influential in the post-Cultural Revolution literary scene, his works have been translated into many languages. ==Early life and career== Cong was born on 7 April 1933 in Daiguantun, Zunhua County (now part of Yutian County) in Hebei, Republic of China. His grandfather held a xiucai degree during the late Qing dynasty, and his father worked as an aeronautical engineer in Chongqing. In 1937, his father died in prison after being arrested by the Kuomintang government for attempting to defect to the Communist Party. His mother, an illiterate woman with bound feet, brought the four-year-old Cong to live with her parents. They moved to Beijing in 1946 where Cong attended school. After the establishment of the People's Republic of China, he enrolled at Beijing Normal School in 1950 and published his first essay, \\"Going to the Battle\\", about patriotic youths fighting in the Korean War. After graduating from Beijing Normal School in 1953, Cong taught at an elementary school for half a year before joining the Beijing Daily as a reporter. In 1955, he published July Rain (), his first short-story collection. He published a second collection, The Morning Sun Rises (), and a novel, Spring Morning along South River (), in the next two years, earning himself recognition as an emerging writer. == Anti-Rightist Campaign and laogai == During the Hundred Flowers Campaign, when the Communist government invited opinions and criticisms from intellectuals, Cong published the essay \\"A Few Questions Concerning Socialist Realism\\" in the April 1957 issue of the journal Beijing Literature and Art, in which he questioned the need for the adjective \\"socialist\\" in socialist realism and argued that the term excessively emphasized politics and encouraged formulaic writing. His friend also wrote an essay criticizing socialist realism in the same journal. The Communist Party soon turned against intellectuals who criticized its policies and started the Anti-Rightist Campaign in 1957. Beijing Literature and Art published an article calling Cong and Liu \\"poisonous weeds\\" who had been lured to \\"stick their heads out above ground\\". Cong was soon denounced as a \\"rightist\\" and a member of a \\"counterrevolutionary clique\\", together with Liu Shaotang, Wang Meng, and . The four writers were collectively known as the \\"Four Black Swans\\" () of Beijing. Cong's wife Zhang Hu (), who was also a reporter at Beijing Daily, was condemned as a rightist at the same time for criticizing excessive formalism and bureaucracy at her employer. After being publicly humiliated, she attempted to kill herself by taking sleeping pills, but was saved (she later attempted suicide for a second time during the Cultural Revolution and was saved again). The couple were both arrested and sent to different laogai (\\"reform through labor\\") camps, leaving their infant son with Cong's mother. Cong and Zhang did not see each other for more than a year, until they were both sent to Qinghe Farm, a notorious labor camp outside of Tianjin. A kind prison guard arranged to have him stay overnight at her camp. Cong endured 20 years in a variety of laogai camps, even after his \\"rightist\\" label was removed. He worked in coal mines, quarried rocks, dug graves and transported manure. ==Post-laogai career and \\"High Wall Literature\\"== After the death of Mao Zedong and the end of the Cultural Revolution in 1976, Cong was released and rehabilitated in 1978. He eagerly resumed writing, using his laogai experience as an inspiration. In 1979, he published the novella The Blood- Stained Magnolias under the High Wall (), about a labor camp inmate being killed by the camp guard. The first Chinese novel about laogai camps, it initiated the \\"High Wall\\" genre of literature (Â§ßÂ¢ôÊñáÂ≠¶; \\"high wall\\" being a euphemism for prison), which reflects on the traumas suffered by political prisoners in the camps during the Anti-Rightist Campaign and the Cultural Revolution. Writer Wang Meng, who served as China's Minister of Culture, called Cong the \\"Father of High Wall Literature\\". Cong subsequently wrote a number of works in the \\"High Wall\\" genre, including the novella Snow Falling Silently onto the Yellow River (), the long novel The Fugitive (), which consists of three novellas, and the novella Grave Stone for a Cat. In 1988, he published the first two parts of his memoir Entering Chaos (). After conducting further research and revisiting the labor camps he had worked at, he published the third and fourth parts of the memoir to much acclaim. They attest to the \\"horror, cruelty, and absurdity\\" of the laogai system, which is often compared with the Gulag system of the Soviet Union. In 1982, Cong revised the novel Grass in the Northern Country (). He had begun writing the novel in 1955, but lost the manuscript during the Cultural Revolution. He was able to recover it after his release from laogai, and finally published the book in 1984. He received more than 1,000 letters from readers after its publication. The novel won four national and municipal literature prizes. He also published a collection of short stories Drinking Soul Going West () in 1990, and the autobiographical novel Naked Snow () in 1994. The latter, written from a child's perspective and set in the Republican era of Cong's childhood, is vastly different from his typical laogai fiction. Cong's works have been highly influential in post-Mao China. They have been translated into English, French, German, Japanese and Serbian. Although known for his works about the \\"Chinese Gulag\\", Cong did not want to be compared to the Soviet writer Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and wrote the essay \\"I Am Not Solzhenitsyn\\". He criticized Solzhenitsyn for being too one-sided and negative, recalling his personal experience with a kind prison guard.

The Canton Indian Insane Asylum (sometimes called Hiawatha Insane Asylum) opened for the reception of patients in January 1903. The first administrator was Oscar S. Gifford. Many of the inmates were not mentally ill. Native Americans risked being confined in the asylum for alcoholism, opposing government or business interests, or for being culturally misunderstood. A 1927 investigation conducted by the Bureau of Indian Affairs determined that a large number of patients showed no signs of mental illness. While open, more than 350 patients were detained there, in terrible conditions. At least 121 died. The asylum was closed in 1934. == Canton Indian Insane Asylum Cemetery == Land was set aside for a cemetery, but the Indian Office decided that stone markers for graves would be an unwarranted expense.

In Victoria, the plant is confined to alpine and subalpine herbfields of the eastern ranges, and often locally plentiful.

The flower appears in Spring, which is a yellow head of florets, similar to flatweed (Hypochaeris radicata) or dandelion (Taraxacum). The flower stalk is pendulous before flowering, becoming erect for flowering to attract pollinators and again with the ripening of the seed head. The seed heads ripen to a cluster of fluffy, tan achenes, each having a crown of fine extensions called a pappus. The seeds are dispersed by wind. The plant has several fleshy roots branching just below ground level that become tuberous. ==Cultivation and uses== The edible tuberous roots of murnong plants were once a vitally important source of food for the Indigenous Australians. In the south-eastern parts of Australia, Indigenous women would dig for roots with a digging stick, also known as a yam stick, and they would carry the roots in a dillybag. The practice of digging for tubers and leaving part of the tuber, meant the soil was tilled and caused more plants to grow. Murnong was cooked by placing a dillybag of tubers onto an earth oven for roasting. The taste of the cooked tuber is described as 'sweet with a flavour of coconut'. The introduction of cattle, sheep and goats by immigrating early‚Äìcolonialist Europeans led to the near extinction of murnong, with calamitous results for first Australians' communities who depended upon murnong for a large part of their food. ==Gallery== File:Murnong clock.pngMurnong seed clock File:Murnong seed.pngSeed comparison; Microseris lanceolata on left, Microseris scapigera on right ==References== lanceolata Category:Asterales of Australia Category:Flora of Victoria (Australia) Category:Herbs Category:Root vegetables Category:Plants described in 1840 ","title":"Microseris lanceolata"},{"id":"5603301","text":"Anthony of Sienna (?‚Äì2 January 1585) was a Portuguese Dominican theologian, so called because of his great veneration for Saint Catherine of Siena.

It was released February 25, 1928 by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. ==Synopsis== Stan and Ollie are hired by a homeowner (Sam Lufkin) to finish building a house for him. Furthermore, they are offered a $500 bonus if they do a speedy job. They then proceed on their appointed task with zeal but experience one disastrous result after another. Compounding their difficulties is a nearby hospital whose small but feisty head nurse sics a policeman (Edgar Kennedy) on the finishers for being too loud in their work. The policeman tries to keep Stan and Ollie as quiet as possible. In doing so, he unwittingly gets in the firing line and suffers numerous indignities, including having a bucket of glue and a stack of shingles fall from the roof onto his head. Eventually the home is finished, and Stan and Ollie seem to have done a passable job. The homeowner arrives. Pleased at what he sees, he gladly pays Stan and Ollie their promised $500 bonus. Moments later, however, a tiny bird lands on the house's chimney, causing the chimney to collapse and crash through the roof, which weakens the entire structure of the new house. The enraged homeowner demands his $500 back. Stan and Ollie refuse and engage in some creative teamwork to keep the $500 in their hands. ==Production and exhibition== The Finishing Touch was filmed in November and December 1927. The film is a descendant of two of the duo's solo films: Laurel's Smithy (1924) and Hardy's Stick Around (1925). The paperhanger character played by Hardy in the latter film \\"was justly important to [Hardy], originating an embryonic form of his eventual screen character.\\"Mitchell, Glenn (1995). The Laurel & Hardy Encyclopedia. London: B. T. Batsford Ltd. , pp 100‚Äì101. The Finishing Touch is set in an area undergoing real estate development in 1927; its wide open spaces provide a sense of a more pastoral Los Angeles that would soon vanish as more structures filled it in. The ill-fated structure in question here was built by the Roach construction team on Motor Avenue near the Fox studio. It was supposed to collapse completely when the duo's truck rolled through it, but an overzealous crew ignored designer Thomas Benton Roberts's design specs and made it too sturdy ‚Äî so the truck lodged halfway through and ground to a stop.Skretvedt, Randy (1996). Laurel and Hardy: The Magic Behind the Movies. Beverly Hills: Past Times Publishing. , pp 112‚Äì114. The Finishing Touch was filmed on location in the neighborhood of Cheviot Hills, Los Angeles. The house under construction in the film was at 2830 Motor Avenue and was destroyed after filming. The hospital scene was filmed at 2728 McConnell Drive at a house that still stands today. Additionally, several other houses in Cheviot Hills can be seen in the background, most prominently 2839 Forrester Drive.http://www.classicvideostreams.com/BCVS/L-H/phg_finishing_touch.htm Script into film L&H; historian Randy Skretvedt unearthed the original action script for The Finishing Touch and discovered gags that were either unfilmed or unused in the finished picture. One gag finds Stan and Ollie in adjacent rooms: Ollie drives a nail in the wall to hang his coat on, but in the next room, the nail snags Stan's sleeve so he drives it back out. On his side of the wall, Ollie cannot figure why his coat is on the floor, but he has his suspicions; just as he steps into Stan's room to confront him, Stan has stepped into his through another door. The nail gets hammered back and forth, until it ultimately hits pay dirt ‚Äî in the beleaguered hide of cop Kennedy. The script also provided additional backstory on how the duo came to be hired to work on the house to begin with: an unfilmed scene portrayed the original construction crew having the same difficulties with the same folks from the same nearby hospital and quitting in frustration. Another change from the script was definitely an improvement: by the time the cameras rolled, the stern male physician of the script had morphed into the petite but spicy nurse played by Dorothy Coburn. Her spirited domination of both The Boys and Kennedy is made all the funnier by her gender and small stature. She makes up in spunk what she lacks in body mass ‚Äî Skretvedt calls her \\"the quintessential tough- cookie.\\" The picture's finale also evolved between script and screen. In the final film, a dainty animated bird alights on the chimney, triggering a domino-effect collapse of the entire house. On the printed page, Stan himself was to be the catalyst for the implosion: he left his derby up on the roof and when he clambers up to get it, the catastrophic sequence commences. As different items tremble and fall, the homeowner takes back more of the money he has paid them, until he has taken all of it back. Differing versions Glenn Mitchell has noticed that The Finishing Touch is one of the few Laurel and Hardy silents with both British and American versions extant today. In the era when primitive film stocks did not permit many generations of copies to be made from a master, producers often set up multiple cameras when shooting so they would get more first-generation elements to work with ‚Äî and those extra negatives often became foreign market prints. They would have slightly different angles and sometimes variations in action or cutting. Writes Mitchell: :In The Finishing Touch, this is most obvious in the close-ups of the nurse, which in the British version are presented from a different perspective and with some dissimilar facial reactions to the American equivalent. An amendment in subtitling tells us that nine years of schooling took Laurel and Hardy to the 'First Reader' for American audiences, and the 'Infants' for the British. Today's American edition, he writes, originates from the Blackhawk Films master and combines footage from both films. ==Cast== *Stan Laurel as Stan *Oliver Hardy as Ollie *Ed Kennedy as The Cop *Dorothy Coburn as The Nurse *Sam Lufkin as The Homeowner ==Reception== The Finishing Touch is considered a prototype film for Laurel and Hardy ‚Äî the first of their \\"workingman\\" pictures, where their professional task itself becomes the backbone of the plot. Dirty Work, Busy Bodies, The Music Box and others all descend from The Finishing Touch. The Laurel & Hardy Encyclopedia' author Glenn Mitchell commented, \\"The Finishing Touch is enjoyable despite an over- reliance on slapstick. One ingenious sight gag [is when] Stan appears to be supporting both ends of a lengthy piece of timber.\\" The Films of Laurel and Hardy author William K. Everson delivered a mixed report in 1967, saying \\"Considering the promise it offers, The Finishing Touch is a slight disappointment. The climactic gags lack the force and 'boff' quality that the build-up has led us to expect, and the whole short has a somewhat mechanical flavor to it. Nevertheless, it has energy, and the problems of house construction... provide every gag with anticipation as well as culmination.\\"Everson, William K. (1967). The Films of Laurel and Hardy. Secaucus, NJ: Citadel Press. , p. 58. Janiss Garza of Allmovie said, \\"This two-reel Laurel and Hardy silent is especially rich in slapstick.... This silly little film doesn't have much plot to speak of, but it's so well constructed, and the humor is so solid, it doesn't matter.\\"Garza, Janiss, at Allmovie.com http://www.allmovie.com/work/148521 Laurel and Hardy: The Magic Behind the Movies author Randy Skretvedt is more guarded in his assessment, saying, \\"If The Finishing Touch isn't as memorable as the films which preceded it, it's a pleasant enough little picture.\\" British film critic Leslie Halliwell commented, \\"Excellent early star slapstick with predictable but enjoyable gags,\\"Walker, John, ed.

The details of the Greek etymology are uncertain, but it is generally accepted to mean \\"lament beside a door\\", from œÄŒ±œÅŒ±Œ∫ŒªŒ±ŒØœâ, \\"lament beside\\", and Œ∏œçœÅŒ±, \\"door\\". A paraklausithyron typically places a lover outside his mistress's door, desiring entry. In Greek poetry, the situation is connected to the komos, the revels of young people outdoors following intoxication at a symposium. Callimachus uses the situation to reflect on self-control, passion, and free will when the obstacle of the door is removed.Niall Livingstone and Gideon Nisbet, Epigram (Cambridge University Press, 2010), pp. 73‚Äì75. Latin poetry offers several examples and variations on the exclusus amator (\\"shut-out lover\\") theme. Horace offers a less-than- serious lament in Odes 3.10 and even threatens the door in 3.26; Tibullus (1.2) appeals to the door itself; in Propertius (1.16), the door is the sole speaker. In Ovid's Amores (1.6), the speaker claims he would gladly trade places with the doorkeeper, a slave who is shackled to his post, as he begs the door-keeper to allow him access to his mistress, Corinna. In the Metamorphoses, the famous wall (invide obstas) with its chink (vitium) that separates the star-crossed lovers, Pyramus and Thisbe, seems to be an extension of this motif. The appeal of the paraclausithyron derives from its condensing of the situation of love elegy to the barest essentials: the lover, the beloved and the obstacle, allowing poets to ring variations on a basic theme. This feature of amatory poetry may owe its origin to Greek New Comedy; as is often the case scholars look to Roman comedy to supply the deficiencies of the highly fragmentary remains of the Greek models and in lines 55 to 65 of Plautus' Curculio is a specimen of a short but nonetheless completely bona fide paraclausithyron. The motif is not merely a historical phenomenon: it continues in contemporary songwriting. Steve Earle's song \\"More Than I Can Do,\\" for example, gives a typical paraklausithyronic situation with such lines as \\"Just because you won't unlock your door /That don't mean you don't love me anymore\\" as does his song \\"Last of the Hardcore Troubadours,\\" in which the singer addresses a woman, saying \\"Girl, don't bother to lock your door / He's out there hollering, \\"Darlin' don't you love me no more?\\" Similarly, the first two verses of Jimi Hendrix's \\"Castles Made of Sand\\" involve paraklausithyronic situation of a man kicked out by his lover. Likewise, Bob Dylan's song \\"Temporary Like Achilles\\" contains many features typical of the ancient motif (lament at the door, long wait, presence of a guard as a further obstacle, etc.) and recalls the pathos and rhetoric of the Roman elegiac paraclausithyron. ==ReferencesSources== *Cairns, Francis.

The evaluation is based on standard criteria and scored from \\"very immature\\" to \\"very mature\\" while the essay is graded from advanced, normal, and backwards. A tree is selected as the object to be drawn because trees serve as an important element in mythologies all over the world. Additionally, trees are a nonthreatening element that allow for a wide range of adaptation. It is suggested by some psychologists (e.g. J.H. Plokker) that the type of tree an individual draws relates to the structure of the psyche or unconscious itself or that it symbolizes one's personality as it can project self-image. ==Forms of analysis== Two forms of analysis are used to evaluate and interpret the Baum test. The global structure analysis views the tree as a whole, such the tree's overall size and location on the paper. The internal structure analysis focuses on the finer details of the tree. There are 59 detail oriented aspects of the tree drawing that are used to evaluate an individual's thoughts or feelings including roots, trunk, branches, crown, leaves, knots, shading, symmetry, archetypal features etc. ==Advantages and limitations== Advantages of the Baum test are that it can be administered quickly (usually 5‚Äì10 minutes), to a wide range of individuals, and it offers the clinician an opportunity to observe the patients motor skills. Limitations of the Baum test are that it cannot be scored objectively. ‚ÄúOne problem concerning the validity of the drawing technique is that researchers choose procedures that will no doubt result in nonsignificant findings. For example, they isolate one or a few indices from a figure drawing rating scale, taken completely out of context, and then attempt to correlate these indices with measure they view as excellent criterion variables, such as self-report inventories.‚Äù Additionally, the test typically not used on patients with very low IQs because their drawings tend to be quite meager. ==Indications== *Large Baum: indicates self-confidence *Small Baum: indicates a lack of self- confidence *Big trunk: indicates straightforwardness and liveliness *Small trunk: indicates weariness *Deep Roots: indicates stability *No Roots/Shallow roots: indicates a feeling of exclusion *No Branches/Small Branches: indicates unsocial behavior *Big Branches: indicates arrogance *Large Leaves: indicates friendliness, social ability *Small Leaves: indicates shyness == References == * Baum-Tests by Ursula Av√©-Lallemant 2002 (in German) == External links == * Article on Baum test (in German) * Baum Forms and Their Meanings: A Case Study * Agamic Psychology: The Baum Test and Hermeneutic Semiotics Category:Clinical psychology tests ","title":"Baum test"},{"id":"5603367","text":"Tree test may mean: * Tree testing, a method of evaluating topic trees for findability * Baum test, projective drawing technique developed by Karl Koch ","title":"Tree test"},{"id":"5603368","text":"The government of Alaska in common with state and federal governments of the United States, has three branches of government: the executive, consisting of the Governor of Alaska and the state agencies; the state legislature consisting of two chambers, the House of Representatives and the Senate; and the judiciary consisting of the Supreme court and lower courts. Alaska has 246 federally recognized tribal governments and one federal Indian (Native American) reservation.University of Alaska Justice Center local & borough government ==Executive== The Governor of Alaska is the senior-most official of the Alaska executive branch. The main Alaska state agencies are the: * Alaska Court System * Department of Administration * Department of Commerce, Community and Economic Development * Department of Corrections * Department of Education and Early Development * Department of Environmental Conservation * Department of Fish and Game * Department of Health and Social Services * Department of Labor and Workforce Development * Department of Law * Department of Military and Veteran Affairs * Department of Natural Resources * Department of Public Safety * Department of Revenue * Department of Transportation and Public Facilities Other agencies are the: * Alaska Division of Juvenile Justice * Alaska Permanent Fund * Alaska Volcano Observatory * Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission * Alaska State Pension Investment Board ==Legislature== Alaska has a Legislature. It is a bicameral institution, consisting of a lower chamber, the Alaska House of Representatives with 40 members, and an upper chamber, the Alaska Senate with 20 members. There are 40 House Districts (1-40) and 20 Senate Districts (A-T). The Alaska Legislature meets in the State Capitol building in Juneau. ==Judiciary== The Alaska Court System is the unified, centrally administered, and totally state-funded judicial system. The Alaska District Court are the primary misdemeanor trial courts, the Alaska Superior Courts are the primary felony trial courts, and the Alaska Supreme Court and the Alaska Court of Appeals are the primary appellate courts. The Chief Justice of the Alaska Supreme Court is the administrative head of the Alaska Court System. ==Local government== Alaska has two levels of local government, including boroughs (of which there are 19) and cities (currently 144). Boroughs in Alaska play a role very similar to Counties in the other 49 states. Owing to the state's low population density, most of the land is located in the Unorganized Borough which, as the name implies, has no intermediate borough government of its own, but is administered directly by the state government. Currently (2000 census) 57.71 percent of Alaska's land area has this status; however, its population comprises only 13.05 percent of the state's total. For statistical purposes the United States Census Bureau divides this territory into census areas . Several population centers, including Anchorage and Juneau, have merged their city and borough governments because very few residents of these communities live outside the city but inside the borough. Other localities have both city governments and borough governments--borough governments provide services to less densely populated areas than city governments. Alaska has several types of borough governments and city governments: cities are divided into home rule, first class and second class cities. Boroughs are divided into home rule, first class, second class, and third class boroughs. The difference between these levels of organization (i.e., home rule, first class, second class and so on) is that some boroughs and cities have greater responsibility to provide certain kinds of services, and greater power including greater authority to tax. In general, \\"home rule\\" governments have more responsibility and authority than first class governments, first class governments have more responsibility and authority than second class governments and so on. For example, home rule cities may tax property at a higher rate than second class cities (30 vs. 20 mills) but are required to provide educational services (local schools) while second class cities are not permitted to operate local schools. Home rule cities and boroughs also have greater authority in land use planning, transportation infrastructure, licensing, regulation, waste disposal, economic development, emergency medical services and so on. These differences are complicated somewhat when cities sit inside of boroughs. For example, boroughs are required to operate local schools and therefore if a first class city sits inside of a borough it is not also required to operate a local school district . Areas where no city or borough or governments have yet been established are said to sit inside \\"the Unorganized Borough.\\" In these areas, state government provides most services that would otherwise be provided by cities or boroughs. ==See also== * Politics of Alaska ==ReferencesExternal links== *State of Alaska Category:State governments of the United States ","title":"Government of Alaska"},{"id":"5603373","text":"Amelia High School Amelia High School was a public high school in the West Clermont Local School District in Clermont County, Ohio.

Lucas began his career as a box-to-box midfielder at Gr√™mio where he won the Campeonato Ga√∫cho in 2006 and 2007. In July 2007 he moved to Liverpool, where he played 347 professional matches over the course of a decade, winning the League Cup in 2012. Between 2010 and 2016 Lucas led the Premier League in tackles per game five times in six seasons. He also remains the Brazilian with the most Premier League appearances. He joined Lazio in 2017. A full international since 2007, he has earned 24 caps and represented Brazil at the 2008 Olympics and 2011 Copa Am√©rica, winning a bronze medal at the former. He also captained the under-20 team to victory in the 2007 South American Youth Championship. ==Club career== Gr√™mio Born in Dourados, Mato Grosso do Sul, Lucas began his career at Gr√™mio as a midfielder in 2005. The following year was a successful year for him, as Gr√™mio won the Rio Grande do Sul state championship (the Campeonato Ga√∫cho) for the first time since 2001, and also came third in the Campeonato Brasileiro S√©rie A. Lucas also became the youngest player ever to receive Placar magazine's Bola de Ouro (Golden Ball), given to the best player in the Campeonato Brasileiro ‚Äì an honour previously won by the likes of Zico, Falc√£o, Careca, Alex, Rom√°rio, Robinho, Kak√° and Carlos Tevez. His form in 2006 led to reported interest from many major European clubs including offers from top Spanish clubs and Internazionale. It was Liverpool that proved most attractive to the player, however, and on 13 May 2007, the club confirmed they had signed the player from Gr√™mio before the start of the 2007‚Äì08 season. The transfer fee was in the region of ¬£6 million. Liverpool 2007‚Äì2009 On 26 July 2007, he was officially unveiled as a Liverpool player for a fee of ¬£5 million and was given international clearance to compete in the final of the Barclays Asia Trophy. By late November, manager Rafael Ben√≠tez gave Lucas his chance to start a game in the Liverpool midfield after easing him in during his first few months at the club. Lucas scored his first goal for Liverpool on 27 January 2008 when he curled a 25-yard shot into the top corner during an FA Cup match against Havant & Waterlooville, becoming the first-ever Brazilian to score for Liverpool. Liverpool in 2009 The start of the 2008‚Äì09 season signified an important turning point for his career. Many commentators expected him to step up to the next level after completing his first season with the Reds. The Brazilian got off to a good start with a well taken opening goal in a 2‚Äì1 friendly win over Swiss side Lucerne in July. He impressed in pre-season games but missed the start of Premier League season due to his selection for the Brazilian Olympic Team in the Beijing Olympics. Lucas returned with a bronze medal and Ben√≠tez had high hopes for the Brazilian's future, stating, \\"This season he will improve because he is a very, very good professional and has experience of the Olympic Games.\\" Lucas noted that Liverpool's squad was much improved from the previous season and relished the opportunity to compete for trophies, despite the increased difficulty of getting a first-team place. However, after a number of disappointing performances, both critics and fans voiced concerns about Lucas' quality and his confidence was further knocked when Liverpool fans booed him after a lacklustre draw against Fulham. The criticism irked Ben√≠tez and he responded with a passionate defence of the player, saying that \\"people just don't know how good Lucas is.\\" Ben√≠tez also underlined Lucas' credentials, stating that he had been captain for both Gr√™mio and his national youth team, and that competing for place against Javier Mascherano, Steven Gerrard and Xabi Alonso was inherently difficult. Lucas' performances in December 2008 for Liverpool drew him much praise from pundits, the highlight being his performance in the 5‚Äì1 thrashing of Newcastle United, where he provided an assist for Gerrard. Lucas was sent off in a cup tie against Mersey rivals Everton, which Liverpool lost. This compounded his growing unpopularity amongst Liverpool's supporters, after he gave away a late penalty in Liverpool's previous match, a 1‚Äì1 draw with Wigan Athletic.Kay, Oliver (4 February 2009). Dan Gosling strikes at the last to put Rafael Ben√≠tez's men out of their misery. The Times. Retrieved on 5 February 2009. On 14 March, Lucas played a key role in Liverpool's 4‚Äì1 victory over Manchester United at Old Trafford, starting in place of the injured Xabi Alonso. On 14 April, Lucas played against Chelsea in the Champions League, in place of Steven Gerrard. He scored a goal with his long- range effort in the 81st minute deflected off Michael Essien and past goalkeeper Petr ƒåech to make the score 3‚Äì3. Dirk Kuyt's header a minute later briefly gave Liverpool the lead, but Frank Lampard's 89th-minute strike leveled the score to 4‚Äì4, with Chelsea winning 7‚Äì5 on aggregate to go through to the semi-finals of the tournament. On 3 May 2009, Lucas scored his first Premier League goal, a header from a free-kick for Liverpool against Newcastle United in a 3‚Äì0 win. Lucas playing for Liverpool in 2012 During the 2009‚Äì10 pre-season period, Lucas showed good form scoring Liverpool's only goal in a 2‚Äì1 loss against Atl√©tico Madrid. This form earned praise from manager Rafael Ben√≠tez, and gained him a start against Tottenham Hotspur for the opening game of the 2009‚Äì10 season on 16 August. Liverpool lost 2‚Äì1, but Lucas earned praise for a solid performance all round. 2010‚Äì2013 On 8 April 2010, Lucas scored his second European goal for Liverpool, scoring in a 4‚Äì1 (5‚Äì3 aggregate) quarter-final win over Benfica in the UEFA Europa League quarter- finals.

On 16 September 2010, Lucas scored his sixth goal for Liverpool shortly after replacing Ryan Babel in the club's first Europa League group stage match against Steaua Bucure»ôti. The goal was Liverpool's third in a 4‚Äì1 victory and was scored from 22 yards. On 13 November, Lucas was sent off for the second time in his Liverpool career after being shown a second yellow card in injury time in Liverpool's 2‚Äì0 defeat to Stoke City.

Lucas was awarded Liverpool Player of the Year Award in May 2011. On 30 March, Lucas signed a new long term contract at Liverpool. After an excellent run of form for Liverpool, his season was unfortunately cut short on 1 December 2011, when it was confirmed he was out for the remainder of the season after he suffered an anterior cruciate ligament injury after he collided with Juan Mata in the 2‚Äì0 win over Chelsea in the quarter-final of the League Cup. On 10 April 2013, Lucas signed a new long term deal with the club. He was a consistent starter in the opening few months of the 2013‚Äì14 season as Liverpool put up an unexpected title challenge, though his season was again cut short by injury. His good form saw him make a return to the Brazilian national team's squad. 2014‚Äì2017 Martin ≈†krtel alongside Lucas for Liverpool in 2014 In the initial run of games within the 2014‚Äì15 Premier League and other cup competitions, Lucas was rotated in and out of the squad, leading to speculation surrounding a move away from Anfield. He made his comeback, however, as a starter against Ludogorets in the Champions League with a good display. His fine form continued and he started games against Stoke City, Leicester City and Sunderland. Lucas' good run continued as Liverpool then played against Manchester United, Arsenal, Burnley, Swansea City, Leicester and Sunderland out of which Liverpool only lost to United and then achieved five games without defeat in a row with Lucas as an integral member. Lucas was on the substitute bench on 22 March in a 2‚Äì1 defeat against Manchester United after coming back from a six-week injury layoff. Despite rumours of him leaving Anfield, Lucas was restored to the starting lineup. Following the sacking of manager Brendan Rodgers, Lucas under new manager J√ºrgen Klopp was praised for his excellent form in the club's 11-game unbeaten run. Lucas made his 300th appearance for Liverpool on 26 January 2016 against Stoke City in the Football League Cup semi-final at Anfield. Lucas captained the side in the Premier League match against Crystal Palace on 8 November, a 2‚Äì1 defeat for Liverpool. On 28 February 2016, Lucas started for Liverpool in central defence in the 2016 Football League Cup Final.

He was expected to lead the team again in the 2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup held in Canada in July 2007 and was named in their squad, but an injury in training kept him from playing for three weeks, leading to his withdrawal from the squad. In October 2006, Lucas was included in the senior Brazilian squad for friendlies against Kuwaiti club Al-Kuwait and Ecuador. Lucas was both the youngest member and one of only two non-Europe based players in a strong squad. He made his debut for Brazil on 7 October 2006 coming on as a second-half substitute against Al-Kuwait. Brazil won the match 4‚Äì0, but his appearance did not count as his first cap‚Äîthe match was not considered an official friendly match by FIFA. Lucas gained his first official Brazil international cap on 22 August 2007, coming on as a substitute in a friendly against Algeria. In June 2008, Lucas was named in the Brazil squad for an Olympics warm-up match later in the month. On 19 August, Lucas was shown a red card in the 2008 Olympics semi-final match between Brazil and Argentina, after a challenge on then Liverpool teammate Javier Mascherano, as Argentina ran out 3‚Äì0 winners. In August 2009, Lucas was recalled to the senior Brazil squad in place of Flamengo's Kl√©berson, who was absent through injury. After missing out on the Brazil world cup squad in South Africa, Lucas played the full 90 minutes in a friendly against the United States on 10 August 2010. On 17 July 2011, Lucas was shown a straight red card in the 2011 Copa Am√©rica play-off quarter final against Paraguay, after an extra time altercation with Antol√≠n Alcaraz. Brazil went on to lose the match on penalties after the match had finished all square after 90 minutes. ==Style of play== Although he is primarily deployed as a defensive midfielder, Lucas is also capable of playing as a makeshift central defender, due to his tackling ability; between 2010 and 2016 Lucas led the Premier League in tackles per game five times in six seasons. An efficient midfielder, despite not being particularly quick, prolific, skilful, or creative on the ball, he is a hard- tackling player, who is known for his work-rate, stamina, and tenacity on the pitch, as well as his tactical intelligence and professionalism as a footballer. ==Personal life== Lucas is the nephew of former Brazilian footballer Leivinha and also holds an Italian passport due to his descent from the country. In addition to his native Portuguese, Lucas can also speak English and Spanish. ==Career statistics== Club {  + Appearances and goals by club, season and competition - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Club !rowspan=\\"2\\"Season !colspan=\\"3\\"League !colspan=\\"2\\"National Cup !colspan=\\"2\\"League Cup !colspan=\\"2\\"Continental !colspan=\\"2\\"Total - !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals - rowspan=\\"4\\"Gr√™mio 2005 S√©rie B 300000colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî30 - 2006 rowspan=\\"2\\"S√©rie A 32441160colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî525 - 2007 3000928Appearance(s) in the Copa Libertadores1203 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !3844125281758 - rowspan=\\"11\\"Liverpool 2007‚Äì08 rowspan=\\"10\\"Premier League 18041307Appearance(s) in the UEFA Champions League0321 - 2008‚Äì09 2512021101393 - 2009‚Äì10 350200013Five appearances in the UEFA Champions League and eight appearances in the UEFA Europa League1501 - 2010‚Äì11 330101012Appearance(s) in the UEFA Europa League1471 - 2011‚Äì12 1200030colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî150 - 2012‚Äì13 260100040310 - 2013‚Äì14 2701010colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî290 - 2014‚Äì15 200305040320 - 2015‚Äì16 260105070400 - 2016‚Äì17 2404130colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî311 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !24711822415733467 - rowspan=\\"5\\"Lazio 2017‚Äì18 rowspan=\\"4\\"Serie A 362401Appearance in the Supercoppa Italiana092504 - 2018‚Äì19 27050colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî40360 - 2019‚Äì20 250101030300 - 2020‚Äì21 4000colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî0040 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !922100201621204 - ! colspan=\\"3\\"  Career total !377732351381654119 } International {  - ! colspan=3  Brazil - !Year!!Apps!!Goals - 200710 - 200820 - 200910 - 201040 - 2011120 - 201340 - !Total240 } ==Honours== Club At the end of the 2016‚Äì17 season, Lucas received a commemorative trophy to mark 10 years at the club.

The population of the town is around 15,000. ==Overview== Despite the name Isola (island), the town is entirely on the mainland. There are several theories about the name, which may derive from Greek mythology or may be a corruption of a Greek word. Geographically the seaside district of the town of Capo Rizzuto is a peninsula. Elsewhere the main historical attraction, the powerful 16th-century fortification in the district of Le Castella, stands on piece of land connected to the mainland by a narrow causeway. In 1977 the archaeologist Domenico Marino discovered and excavated a site on the Capo Piccolo promontory with important Early Bronze Age II and Middle Bronze Age I-II artifacts of Minoan origin, demonstrating early trade contact between the eastern Mediterranean and Italy. The finds are on display in the National Archaeological Museum in nearby Crotone.

He is best known as a former premiership player with the West Coast Eagles as well as being a back up ruckman for the Sydney Swans. ==Biography== Originally from country Western Australia, Seaby was recruited from West Perth at pick 22 in the 2001 AFL Draft by the West Coast Eagles. He made his senior AFL debut in Round 4, 2004 against the Brisbane Lions and became a regular player that season due to injury issues with senior ruckman Michael Gardiner. While Gardiner's understudy Dean Cox rose to prominence, Seaby served as a secondary ruckmman into 2005, occasionally being used as a tall forward option with some success. In early 2006 his chances of maintaining his position received a boost with Gardiner receiving an indefinite suspension from the club due to disciplinary issues. After being relegated to the WAFL upon the return of Gardiner in Round 13, he was brought back when Dean Cox broke his collarbone in the same game. He and Gardiner's first tandem game was a blowout, with Hawthorn's Peter Everitt beating them convincingly. Their next, and last, was largely better, with Seaby getting a season-high 31 hitouts. Gardiner was fined and again suspended indefinitely after a drunken car crash just days later, leaving Seaby to ruck without a specialised backup for a handful of weeks in which he performed admirably. Seaby returned to his position as secondary ruckman when Cox returned from injury and went on to be part of West Coast's 2006 Premiership team. He maintained his position during the 2007 season, continuing as backup to Dean Cox and occasionally playing as a tall forward. 2008 was a poor season for Seaby. He played many games in the WAFL in 2008 because of Dean Cox's stellar form (despite a broken foot) and Quinten Lynch's ability to pinch-hit in the ruck whilst contributing more around the ground. He officially announced his intentions of leaving the West Coast Eagles on 2 October 2009. The Eagles then traded Seaby to the Sydney Swans for its second round draft pick (#22 overall) in a complex three-team deal, involving Amon Buchanan who was traded to Brisbane. In the same deal, the Brisbane Lions got Buchanan and Brent Staker and lost Bradd Dalziell to the Eagles along with pick number 28 to the Swans. The Swans also traded their pick number 22 to the Eagles. At the Swans, he was given the number 1 guernsey, previously worn by Barry Hall. Seaby suffered an ankle injury in the opening minute of the Swans' 20-point win over the Brisbane Lions and subsequently missed the remainder of the season. The Swans however were not disadvantaged by the injury; as they had also picked up Shane Mumford in a trade from Geelong Cats. Seaby was delisted by the Sydney Swans on 8 October 2012. ==Statistics== : - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" center\\"  2004   14  17  14  8  61  76  137  56  24  199  0.8  0.5  3.6  4.5  8.1  3.3  1.4  11.7 - ! scope=\\"row\\" center\\"  2005   14  19  13  5  81  85  166  58  30  211  0.7  0.3  4.3  4.5  8.7  3.1  1.6  11.1 - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" center\\"  2006   14  23  11  5  76  124  200  65  36  285  0.5  0.2  3.3  5.4  8.7  2.8  1.6  12.4 - ! scope=\\"row\\" center\\"  2007   14  24  20  5  98  147  245  81  48  306  0.8  0.2  4.1  6.1  10.2  3.4  2.0  12.8 - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text- align:center\\"  2008   14  14  6  4  64  71  135  44  24  148  0.4  0.3  4.6  5.1  9.6  3.1  1.7  10.6 - ! scope=\\"row\\" center\\"  2009   14  5  0  1  18  34  52  15  10  63  0.0  0.2  3.6  6.8  10.4  3.0  2.0  12.6 - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" center\\"  2010   1  6  2  1  24  39  63  18  14  95  0.3  0.2  4.0  6.5  10.5  3.0  2.3  15.8 - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text- align:center\\"  2011   1  7  2  1  36  35  71  20  22  161  0.3  0.1  5.1  5.0  10.1  2.9  3.1  23.0 - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" center\\"  2012   1  5  1  1  18  41  59  9  19  132  0.2  0.2  3.6  8.2  11.8  1.8  3.8  26.4 - class=\\"sortbottom\\" ! colspan=3 Career ! 120 ! 69 ! 31 ! 476 ! 652 ! 1128 ! 366 ! 227 ! 1600 ! 0.6 ! 0.3 ! 4.0 ! 5.4 ! 9.4 ! 3.1 ! 1.9 ! 13.3 } ==ReferencesExternal links== * * Category:1984 births Category:Living people Category:Australian rules footballers from Western Australia Category:West Coast Eagles players Category:Sydney Swans players Category:People educated at Scotch College, Perth Category:Australian Christians Category:People from Mukinbudin, Western Australia Category:West Perth Football Club players Category:Claremont Football Club players ","title":"Mark Seaby"},{"id":"5603429","text":"Maria Clementina of Austria may refer to: *Archduchess Maria Clementina of Austria, Hereditary Princess of Naples (1777-1801) *Archduchess Clementina, Princess of Salerno, Archduchess Maria Clementina of Austria, Princess of Salerno (1798-1881) ","title":"Maria Clementina of Austria"},{"id":"5603431","text":"Dionysus was a Swedish/German power metal band formed in 1999 by Sinergy drummer Ronny Milianowicz and disbanded in 2008. ==Biography== Dionysus debut album \\"Sign of Truth\\" was recorded at the Rh√∂n Studio in Fulda, Germany in 2002, which is best known for its productions with Edguy and Avantasia.

Today, wilderness or expedition medicine is practiced by Wilderness First Responders, Wilderness EMTs, Remote/Offshore/Wilderness Paramedics and Physicians on expeditions, in outdoor education, search and rescue, mountain rescue, remote area operations including research, exploration, and offshore oil platforms, as well as tactical environments. In mainland Europe, where mountain rescue is done by paid professionals, there are courses for physicians that help qualify them to be mountain rescue or expedition doctors. Many of these courses lead to an International Diploma in Mountain Medicine, which is recognized by the Union Internationale des Associations Alpinistes. ==US == In the United States, where mountain and other wilderness rescue on land is usually done by volunteers, there is no equivalent diploma. However, there are many wilderness medicine conferences at which medical professionals can earn continuing education credits, and some medical schools (for example, at the University of New Mexico) have begun offering electives in wilderness medicine. Other electives are based in community training centers and not medical schools, such as the Carolina Wilderness EMS Externship.http://www.blueridgehealth.org/wildems ==WMS== The Internationally active Wilderness Medical Society is an organization dedicated to wilderness medicine education and research, and they conduct multiple conferences annually in this area. Anyone who is interested in wilderness medicine can join the organization as an associate member, and receive their magazine, Wilderness Medicine. Their peer-reviewed journal, Wilderness and Environmental Medicine, is archived on their web site (www.wms.org), and back issues are accessible to the public at no cost. Training in wilderness medicine is specialized, involving advanced practices and protocols due to the distance from hospitals and physicians. Common US certifications include Wilderness First Aid, Wilderness First Responder, and Wilderness EMT. While there is no legislation on standards of care for wilderness emergency care, there is a consensus of wilderness medical experts published by the Wilderness Medical Society http://www.wms.org ==Med schools== Wilderness Medicine is popular in medical school communities, and many student groups hold their own Wilderness Medicine Conferences. One of the earliest examples is the Carolina Wilderness Medicine Seminar, organized at UNC-Chapel Hill by medical students Seth C. Hawkins and Jenny Graham in March 1998 http://www.wemsi.org/wmedq198.txt and repeated in 2000.http://www.unc.edu/news/archives/apr00/wildmed042800.htm More recent examples include the Mid-Atlantic Student Wilderness Conference http://www.phillywildernessconference.org and the Appalachian Center for Wilderness Medicine's ACWM Southeast Student Wilderness Medicine Conference.http://www.healthline.com/health-blogs/outdoor- medicine/appalachian-center-wilderness-medicine The ACWM conference ran from 2008-2012 and was notable in that it rotated to a new host medical school in the American southern Appalachians every year.https://www.facebook.com/events/146583108697372/ All these conferences commonly feature prominent members of the wilderness medicine community as guest speakers and workshop leaders. Additionally, many top tier emergency physicians and surgeons are active in the field. ==Sports oriented institutions== Many organizations offer training in wilderness emergency care to lay people, which may include techniques that go beyond urban first aid or EMT training, such as reducing dislocations. The National Ski Patrol (www.nsp.org), a volunteer organization with a congressional charter, has an 80-hour course to train patrollers, Outdoor Emergency Care, which meets the standards for an EMT (Emergency Medical Technician) course. Stonehearth Open Learning Opportunities (SOLO, the world‚Äôs oldest continuously operating school of wilderness medicine), The Wilderness Medicine Institute of NOLS, Wilderness Medical Associates, the Wilderness Medicine Training Center, Aerie Backcountry Medicine, and Remote Medical International offer courses up to the Wilderness EMT level. The American Safety & Health Institute (www.ashinstitute.org) has a Wilderness Emergency Care program that offers a full range of courses including Wilderness First Aid, Wilderness First Responder, and Wilderness EMT Upgrade. Most outdoor organizations that take people into wilderness settings now require their trip leaders, guides or camp councilors to be certified in such a course. ==Other Educational Organizations== Wilderness Medical Society (WMS) World Extreme Medicine (WEM) Wilderness Medical Institute of NOLS (WMI) Wilderness Medical Associates (WMA) Center for Wilderness Safety (CWS) Wilderness Medicine Outfitters (WMO) Longleaf Wilderness Medicine (LWM) Wilderness Medicine Training Center (WMTC) Stonehearth Open Learning Opportunities (SOLO) American Red Cross (ARC) Canadian Red Cross (CRC) Remote Medical International (RMI) Appalachian Center for Wilderness Medicine (ACWM) Desert Mountain Medicine (DMM) Carolina Wilderness EMS Externship Wilderness MD Aerie Backcountry Medicine Backcounty Pulse ==Related Topics== *Wilderness Medical Society *Wilderness diarrhea *Travel medicine * Wilderness medical emergency * List of wilderness medical emergencies ==ReferencesExternal links== * eMedicine: Wilderness and Travel Medicine * ","title":"Wilderness medicine education in the US"},{"id":"5603467","text":"De Rossi () is an Italian surname, and may refer to: *Alessandra De Rossi, Philippine actress *Andrea de Rossi (born 1972), Italian former rugby union footballer and a current coach *Andrea de Rossi (archbishop) (1644-1696), Italian Roman Catholic Archbishop of Rossano *Angela de' Rossi (1506-1573), Italian noblewoman *Angelo de Rossi (1671-1715), Italian sculptor *Assunta De Rossi, Philippine actress *Azariah dei Rossi, an Italian-Jewish physician and scholar *Barbara De Rossi (born 1960), Italian actress *Bernardo de Rossi, Italian theologian and historian *Bernardo de' Rossi (1468-1527), Italian bishop and patron of the arts *Bernardino de Rossi (15th century), Italian artist at the court of Lodovico Sforza *Biagio Proto de Rossi (1548-1646), Roman Catholic Archbishop of Messina *Camilla de Rossi (fl. 1670‚Äì1710), Italian composer *Daniele De Rossi, Italian former footballer *Domenico de' Rossi (1659-1730), Italian sculptor and engraver *Elena De Rossi Filibeck (20th century), Italian writer on Tibetan subjects *Fabrizio De Rossi Re (born 1960), Italian composer and librettist *Francesco de' Rossi (1510-1563), Italian Mannerist painter *Giannetto De Rossi (born 1942), Italian make up artist *Giovan Antonio de' Rossi (1616‚Äì1695), Italian architect of the Baroque *Giovanni Battista de Rossi, 19th-century Italian archaeologist *Giovanni Battista de' Rossi (1698-1764), Italian Roman Catholic priest *Giovanni Bernardo De Rossi, 19th-century Italian Christian Hebraist *Giovanni de' Rossi (1431-1502), Italian condottiero and the fifth count of San Secondo *Giovanni de Rossi (bishop) (died 1667), Roman Catholic Bishop of Ossero and Bishop of Chiron *Giovanni Giacomo de Rossi (1627-1691), Italian engraver and printer, active in Rome *Giuseppe de Rossi O.F.M.

These weapon proficiencies may or may not affect the job class people will choose when they reach a certain level for job change. Each of the five characters specializes in his or her own weaponry. For example \\"The Ruthless Blade\\" character with the ability to wield a bow, swords and blades. \\"The Piercing Eyes\\" character with the ability to use Swords, Blades and throwing weapon. \\"The Overseer of Sky\\" Uses axes, rods, and spears, and \\"The Elegant Mystic\\" which uses gauntlets, spears and rods. \\"The Mystic Muse\\" uses dual swords, dual rods, and a large instrument. The Monk uses rods and destructive spells. As of July 31, 2006, Hero Online had its official release and is no longer in beta. == Characters == Hero Online has six \\"character classes\\" that players can choose when creating their character, two of which having two genders, and each gender having a special weapon. Though there is little customizability in the choice of characters, players have the option to choose your characters based on their weapon. More detailed customization is also available later in many forms described in the following sections, as well as the players weapon of choice. == Character improving == Hero online mostly uses the usual level up method. Though, instead of gaining skill points by leveling, skill points are gained by a different experience curve. The skills are divided into two groups: Skills and passive skills. Skills are learned by reading books that are sold by players and book merchants. Each weapon type and job class have their own skills, which gives players many possibilities of character building. At higher levels there are also skills that can be learned by everyone. There are also special books that can retrieve used skill points. == Job Classes == Starting at Level 10, (Or 1 Dan, game terms) players are able to choose their first class. Once players ascend to Level 50, they are able to embark on a quest for their Promotion. Each class set has two different promotion option. Each class in the promotion is engineered to a specific type of gameplay. At Level 100, players can attain Level 101, where they will be able to choose their next class. Once at Level 101, players can choose from any of these, regardless of previous class choices. == External links == *Hero Online - USA Game Service hero.netgame.com Official North American Website Category:2006 video games Category:Massively multiplayer online role-playing games Category:Windows games ","title":"Hero Online"},{"id":"5603479","text":"Their Purple Moment is a silent short subject directed by James Parrott starring comedy duo Laurel and Hardy.

Recruited at pick 28 in the 1997 AFL Draft by the Eagles from local WAFL club Claremont, Jones debuted in his first season at the Eagles, the round 19, 1998 match against the Sydney Swans at the SCG. From the 1999 season, Jones became a regular selection in the West Coast team, and indeed finished third in the Eagles' best and fairest in 2001. Jones' form tailed off quite a bit in 2004, unfortunately coinciding with an appointment as a vice- captain, and when the 2005 season came around, spots in the side were scarce, and Jones was relegated to playing in the WAFL for much of the season. A weight of impressive performances at WAFL level enabled Jones to force his way into the Eagles senior side for four matches, including the Preliminary Final, but he was injured at training and was unable to play in the Grand Final loss. Jones's improved form late in 2005 carried through into the 2006 season, where he once again became a regular in the team, playing 23 of a possible 26 games, including being a member of the Eagles Grand Final team that won by a point over the Swans and thus a premiership player. Rowan Jones announced his retirement on 19 September 2007, citing a desire to leave the game on his own terms and spend more time with his young family. ==Statistics== :Rowan Jones' player profile at AFL Tables - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" center\\"  1998 center;\\"  31  2  1  0  3  2  5  2  2  0.5  0.0  1.5  1.0  2.5  1.0  1.0 - ! scope=\\"row\\" center\\"  1999 style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  31  16  7  5  68  70  138  27  20  0.4  0.3  4.3  4.4  8.6  1.7  1.3 - eaeaea;\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" center\\"  2000 center;\\"  18  20  8  10  138  134  272  41  56  0.4  0.5  6.9  6.7  13.6  2.1  2.8 - ! scope=\\"row\\" center\\"  2001 center;\\"  18  18  11  4  115  133  248  51  54  0.6  0.2  6.4  7.4  13.8  2.8  3.0 - eaeaea;\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" center\\"  2002 center;\\"  18  13  6  0  66  105  171  22  42  0.5  0.0  5.1  8.1  13.2  1.7  3.2 - ! scope=\\"row\\" center\\"  2003 center;\\"  18  23  14  15  183  175  358  93  64  0.6  0.7  8.0  7.6  15.6  4.0  2.8 - eaeaea;\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text- align:center\\"  2004 center;\\"  18  16  0  4  74  122  196  45  41  0.0  0.3  4.6  7.6  12.3  2.8  2.6 - ! scope=\\"row\\" center\\"  2005 center;\\"  18  4  2  2  27  35  62  13  7  0.5  0.5  6.8  8.8  15.5  3.3  1.8 - eaeaea;\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  2006 center;\\"  18  23  9  16  178  274  452  117  57  0.4  0.7  7.7  11.9  19.7  5.1  2.5 - ! scope=\\"row\\" center\\"  2007 style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  18  23  12  5  191  245  436  101  43  0.5  0.2  8.3  10.7  19.0  4.4  1.9 - class=\\"sortbottom\\" ! colspan=3 Career ! 158 ! 70 ! 61 ! 1043 ! 1295 ! 2338 ! 512 ! 386 ! 0.4 ! 0.4 ! 6.6 ! 8.2 ! 14.8 ! 3.2 ! 2.4 } ==ReferencesExternal links== * * Category:1979 births Category:Living people Category:West Coast Eagles players Category:Claremont Football Club players Category:People educated at Scotch College, Perth Category:People from Mukinbudin, Western Australia Category:Australian rules footballers from Western Australia ","title":"Rowan Jones"},{"id":"5603501","text":"Citt√† Sant'Angelo () is a city and comune in the province of Pescara, Abruzzo, Italy. ==History== The origins of Citt√† Sant'Angelo are uncertain and have always been a basis for historical discussion, beginning with the Vestini, an ancient Sabine tribe. The numerous archaeological finds between the mouths of the Piomba and Saline Rivers, and the presence of small urban settlements at the site called Marina Sant'Angelo point to the origins of the town during the Roman period, located in the eastern portion of the Vestine region.Visit Citt√† Sant'Angelo - Citt√† Sant'Angelo nella storia Citt√† Sant'Angelo appears to be located where Plinius wrote of the existence of the one of the four Vestini cities, either Angelus or Angulum.Plinius Secundus It is cited from the 12th century as Castrum Sancti Angeli (Latin: \\"Castle of the Holy Angel\\"). Church of San Francesco However, around 400 CE, the first churches were established in the area between Citt√† Sant'Angelo and Atri. The vestino-roman habitations, which would have been located in the nearby Salt Hill, were probably destroyed in the early Middle Ages, during the Gothic War (535‚Äì554); the Longobards (Lombards) who invaded Italy after the Gothic War, would likely have rebuilt the areas from scratch in their present locations, leaving as the trace of their later presence the worship of the archangel Michael. Evidence of this cult can be seen in both the local landmark and the municipal coat of arms. The first official record of the municipality mentions a concession from the Emperor Ludovico II (Louis II of Italy) who granted a privilege to the Monastery of Casauria on the site called \\"CIVITATE S. ANGELI\\", where there was a castle and a port. This was dated 13 October 875. In the 12th century the town was aggregated into Loreto County by the Normans who established the Kingdom of Sicily. It was a Guelph town, destroyed in 1240 by Boemondo Pissono, executioner to Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor of the Hohenstaufen dynasty, and successor to the Normans as the King of Sicily, because the city was too loyal to his enemy, the Roman Catholic Church.Busk, pp. 8-11. The city was rebuilt quickly and took the shape of a fortified nucleus inside a semicircle. The most prominent names were those of Zizza and Salomone. The arrival of the monastic orders in the first half of the 14th century generated widening interest and finally a monastery was established. By 1528 the town was given its current name. In this era Citt√† Sant'Angelo was one of the three major cities of the Penne-Atri diocese, along with the two bishopric sites. This rivalry often resulted in wars, especially for port control at the borders, with the current Silvi Marina and Pineto, in the province of Teramo. In the 16th century the town was aligned to the Castriota family, together with the lands of Spoltore, Moscufo and Montesilvano. It gradually became one of several feudal possessions, between the Carafa and the Piccolomini of Celano, who then gave it to the Pinelli. Gradually an agrarian bourgeoisie firmly established itself through to the 17th century. On 18 February 1699 Lucrezia Camerlengo bought the Angola marquisate for her son Francesco Figliola from the Pinelli for 130,000 ducats. Francesco Figliola transformed the marquisate into a duchy. Between 1300 and 1700, Citt√† Sant'Angelo, despite numerous attacks by French and Spanish, enjoyed a period of prosperity. In the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748) the city passed definitively to the Kingdom of Naples. Italy gained stability for the first time in the 18th century. The new territorial settlement and the accession of the peaceful Ferdinand VI of Spain allowed this peace settlement to last until the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars in 1792. In March 1814, Citt√† Sant'Angelo, together with the municipalities of Penne and Castiglione, formed the setting for the first ups and downs of Carboneria of the Italian Risorgimento, where Messer Raimondo and Penna Sant'Andrea were the protagonists. The revolt was repressed by the troops of Gioacchino Murat, led by General Florestano Pepe, thanks to the betrayal of a conspiracy and the turnaround by several municipalities that had pledged their support but eventually remained silent. The leaders of the uprising, Philip La Noce and Domenico Marulli, who came from Citt√† Sant'Angelo, were shot at Penne and their heads were displayed on the main gate, Porta Sant'Angelo, though Michelangelo Castagna, another leader of the revolt, managed to escape, finding shelter with his sister in the town of Atri. Before joining the Kingdom of Italy, Citt√† Sant'Angelo was the administrative centre from 1837 to 1848 in the Distretto di Citt√† Sant'Angelo, an administrative unit of Abruzzo Ulteriore Primo (the future Province of Teramo), a province of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. It returned to Penne County when the administrative centre was returned to Penne. At the turn of the 20th century, many people left the region and joined a mass migration to the Americas. During the Second World War, in April 1940 the Ministry of the Interior set up and rented the building of the Ex Manifattura Tabacchi, in the historic centre of the city, to serve as the only concentration camp of the province of Pescara, holding about 200 prisoners from Yugoslavia. The location remained active until April 1944. Currently, it hosts the Museum of Contemporary Art. On May 22, 1944, the US Air Force bombed the marina district; seventeen from Citt√† Sant'Angelo lost their lives, in addition to German soldiers. On Monday, June 12, 1944 Citt√† Sant'Angelo was liberated by the Allies. Today, it is known for its historical architecture and as a tourist location that offers a variety of wine and cuisine. ==Points of interest== Citt√† Sant'Angelo is a member of the club \\"I Borghi pi√π belli d'Italia\\".

Antoine Bullant is also sometimes referred to as Jean Bullant (–ñ–∞–Ω –ë—é–ª–∞–Ω) or Anton Bullandt. However, most current scholarly sources refer to him as Antoine Bullant as all 18th-century printed and manuscript copies of his own works spell the name ‚ÄòBullant‚Äô. In Russian his name was also transliterated as –ë—É–ª–∞–Ω, –ë—É–ª–∞–Ω—Ç, –ë—É–ª–ª–∞–Ω—Ç and sometimes \\"trans-transliterated\\" in other languages (e.g., in German, in lists of operas) as Bulant, Bullanto, Bullault, Bullandt, Bjulan. The Grove Dictionary of Music describes him as a French composer and bassoonist of Czech origin, born in Amiens (?), who in 1771 or 1772 settled in Paris, where he published four symphonies (1773) and some chamber instrumental ensembles. There is some controversial information that Bullandt came to Russia in 1780, and entered the service in Imperial St Petersburg Theatres in 1783 and was a founder of \\"St Petersburg Philharmonic Society\\". Biographical data about him are scarce. ==Works== He wrote a large number of operas with Russian librettos, often within Russian national settings, some of which were written by Yakov Knyazhnin.

He served as Prime Minister of Tonga from 1923 until his death in 1941. == Biography == The Royal Family of Tonga, Circa 1930. centre: Prince Tungƒ´ and Queen SƒÅlote; left & front: their 3 sons Prince Taufa'ahau, Prince Sione and Prince Tuku'aho; right: The Queen's sister, Princess Fusipala Prince Tungi was the son of The Honourable Siaosi Tuku ªaho (Lord Tungi of Tatakamotonga) who served as Prime Minister of Tonga from to 1890 to 1893. Tungƒ´'s grandfather was Tungƒ´ Halatuituia. The line of Tungƒ´ chiefs hailed from the exalted village of Tatakamotong. They were descended from the defunct line of Tu ªi Ha ªatakalaua High Chiefs, who in that time were more or less seen as deputy rulers under the Tu ªi Tong Kings. As such, they had a fiercely loyal following among the people of Mu ªa if not from the whole Hahake district of Tongatapu Island. His mother, Lady Mele Siu ªilikutapu was the granddaughter of the Tu ªi Vava ªu: Fƒ´nau  ªUlukƒÅlala III (Tuapasi). As the nephew of the young and unmarried King Siaosi Tupou II, Tungi was the Heir-to-the-Throne, until the King's marriage and the birth of his first child, The Princess SƒÅlote, in 1900. In 1911 Prince Tungi represented the Tongan King at the Coronation of King George V in London. Tungƒ´ was educated at Tupou College, Tonga and Newington College, Sydney, commencing in 1896, aged nine. He was one of seven Tongan nobles to attend Newington at the time. He was a follower of the Wesleyan Methodist Church. He was selected by King Siaosi Tupou II to marry his oldest daughter and heiress presumptive, Princess SƒÅlote. The King favored this match even though she was 12 years younger than Tungi. The Christian wedding ceremony took place on 19 September 1916. The traditional Tongan matrimonial ceremony (known as the Tu'uvala) was celebrated on 21 September. In less than a year, King Siaosi Tupou II would die, and his daughter (The Princess SƒÅlote) would be crowned as the regnant Queen of Tonga. The opening years of Queen Salote's reign were fraught with political difficulties. There was a schism between the two branches of the Methodist Church; and a republican movement threatened to unseat the fledgling monarch. The personality and high status of Prince Tungi helped to elevate the esteem of the people toward their young queen. One of the most eminent accomplishments (contributed by Queen Salote and Prince Tungi) was the births of their children. Between them, The Queen and her Consort carried the blood of all three ancient royal dynasties: the Tu'i Tonga, the Tu'i Ha'atakalaua and the Tu'i Kanokupolu. Their son (The Prince Tuku'aho) died in 1936. However, the other two sons (The Prince Taufa'ahau and The Prince Sione) carried and passed on the combined bloodlines of the three ancient royal dynasties. Prince Tungi served as his wife's Prime Minister from 1923 until his death in 1941. His own experience helped him to train The Queen in the vocation of kingship and government. His death in 1941 during the Second World War was a devastating blow to Queen Salote and yet like Britain's Queen Victoria, she learned to serve her people in spite of her grief and loss. == Titles and honours == *1887‚Äì1893: The Honourable Viliami Mailefihi, Lord Tungƒ´ of Tatakamotonga *1893‚Äì1900: Lord Viliami Tungƒ´ Mailefihi, The Heir Presumptive to the Throne of Tonga *1900‚Äì1917: The Honourable Viliami Mailefihi, Lord Tungƒ´ of Tatakamotonga *1917‚Äì1918: His Royal Highness Prince Viliami Tungƒ´ of Tonga *1918‚Äì1923: His Royal Highness Prince Viliami Tungƒ´, The Prince Consort of Tonga *1923‚Äì1941: HRH Prince Viliami Tungƒ´, The Prince Consort of Tonga, Prime Minister of Tonga * : 50px Honorary Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE ‚Äì 3 May 1937). * : 50px Recipient of the King George V Silver Jubilee Medal (19 June 1911). * : 50px Recipient of the King George VI Coronation Medal (3 June 1935). == References == - Category:1888 births Category:1941 deaths Category:Tongan royal consorts Tungi Tungi Mailefihi Tungi Mailefihi Category:Tongan Methodists Category:20th-century Tongan people Category:19th-century Tongan people Category:Honorary Commanders of the Order of the British Empire Category:Prime Ministers of Tonga Category:Governors of Vava ªu ","title":"Viliami Tungƒ´ Mailefihi"},{"id":"5603551","text":"The Chase Vault in Barbados, mentioned in relation to earlier stories of Jumbees, in the book West Indian tales of old (1915). A jumbee, jumbie or mendo is a type of mythological spirit or demon in the folklore of some Caribbean countries. Jumbee is the generic name given to all malevolent entities. There are numerous kinds of jumbees, reflecting the Caribbean‚Äôs complex history and ethnic makeup, drawing on African, Amerindian, East Indian, Dutch, English, and even Chinese mythology. Different cultures have different concepts of jumbees, but the general idea is that people who have been evil are destined to become instruments of evil (jumbee) in death. Unlike the ghost folklore which represents a wispy fog-like creature, the jumbee casts a dark shadowy figure. == Regional == People in English-speaking Caribbean states that were colonized by the British commonly believe in this creature. The belief is also held by practitioners of Obeah, a form of mystical wizardry that encompasses traditional African beliefs and Western European, primarily Anglican, images and beliefs concerning the dead. Guyana, and various islands‚Äîincluding Antigua and Barbuda in the east, The Bahamas in the north and as far south as Trinidad‚Äîhave long held a tradition of folklore that includes the jumbee. In the French islands Guadeloupe and Martinique, people speak of Zombi rather than Jumbie to describe ghosts, revenants and other supernatural creatures. The √âtang Zombi in Guadeloupe owes its name to the legend of the wife of a slaver who was killed by her husband for trying to free his slaves and now haunts the pond. The people of the Congo speak of what they believe to be a Nfumbi‚Äîancestral ghost‚Äîwhich makes one wonder if there is any correlation between the words Jumbie and Nfumbi.  Trinidad and Tobago  A Moko jumbie is a protecting spirit in Trinidad and Tobago.  The Bahamas  As Elsie Worthington Clews Parsons captured in an 1918 transcription of an old Bahamian story, the jumbee in Jamaica is often called a \\"sprit\\": \\"Dese sprits which you call witch people, dey lives in de air.\\"  Jamaica and Barbados In Jamaica and Barbados, a jumbee is called a duppy.  Montserrat  In the folk religion of Montserrat, a jumbie is a ghost, or spirit of the dead. Jumbies are said to possess people during ceremonies called jumbie dances, which are accompanied by jumbie drums. Four couples perform a set of five progressively quicker quadrilles during the jumbie dance, switching out with other couples until someone is eventually possessed by a jumbie. Jumbies receive numerous small offerings from Montserratians, such as a few drops of rum or food. They are also the subject of numerous superstitions. It is believed that the spirit separates from the body three days after death, at which point the havoc begins. Jumbies are believed to have the ability to shape-shift, usually taking the form of a dog, pig, or more likely, a cat. == Characteristics == There are many recommended ways to avoid or escape jumbie encounters: * If a pair of shoes is left outside the front door of a house, jumbies (who have either no feet at all, or backwards feet) will spend the entire night trying and failing to put on the shoes, rather than entering the house. * Jumbies are similarly distracted by a heap of sand or salt or rice outside a door, since their obsessive curiosity (particularly in the case of the Firerass, or ole Higue) compels them to count every grain before the sun rises. Likewise, a rope with many knots in it will keep a jumbie busy trying to undo them until sunrise. * Upon coming home late at night, walking backwards may prevent a jumbee from following one inside. * If a jumbee chases a person, crossing a river may stop them; since it is believed that jumbees, like their relatives in numerous cultures, cannot follow over water. == See also == * \\"Jumbie Jamberee\\", a popular calypso song * Wekufe * Henry S.

Maria Clementina Francesca as a child Maria Clementina was a younger sister of Marie Louise, Empress of France, Ferdinand I of Austria, and Maria Leopoldina, Empress of Brazil. She was also an older sister of Marie Caroline, Crown Princess of Saxony, Archduke Franz Karl of Austria, and Archduchess Maria Anna of Austria. Through her sister, Marie Louise, she was a sister-in-law of Napoleon I of France; through Maria Leopoldina a sister-in-law of Peter I of Brazil (IV of Portugal); through Marie Caroline a sister-in-law of Frederick Augustus II of Saxony. Maria Clementina was married, 28 July 1816, at Sch√∂nbrunn Palace, Vienna, to her mother's younger brother, Prince Leopoldo of the Two Sicilies, Prince of Salerno, the youngest son of King Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies and Archduchess Maria Carolina of Austria.

She was buried at the Basilica of Santa Chiara in Naples. ==Issue and family== *Stillborn daughter (16 September 1819). *Princess Maria Carolina Augusta of the Two Sicilies (26 April 1822 - 6 December 1869) married Henri d'Orl√©ans, Duke of Aumale and had issue; **Louis Philippe Marie L√©opold d'Orl√©ans, Prince of Cond√© (15 November 1845 - 24 May 1866). **Henri L√©opold Philippe Marie d'Orl√©ans, Duke of Guise (11 September 1847 - 10 October 1847). **Stillborn daughter (1849). **Fran√ßois Paul d'Orl√©ans, Duke of Guise (11 January 1852 - 15 April 1852). **Fran√ßois Louis Philippe Marie d'Orl√©ans, Duke of Guise (5 January 1854 - 25 July 1872). **Stillborn son (15 June 1861). **Stillborn son (June 1864). *Prince Lodovico Carlo of The Two Sicilies (19 July 1824 - 7 August 1824) died in infancy. *Stillborn daughter (5 February 1829). ==Titles, styles, and honours== Titles and styles *1 March 1798 - 11 August 1804: Her Royal Highness Archduchess Clementina of Austria *11 August 1804 - 28 July 1816: Her Imperial and Royal Highness Archduchess Clementina of Austria *28 July 1816 - 10 March 1851: Her Imperial and Royal Highness The Princess of Salerno *10 March 1851 - 3 September 1881: Her Imperial and Royal Highness The Dowager Princess of Salerno Honours * : Dame of the Order of the Starry Cross.Hof- und Staats-Handbuch des Kaiserthumes √ñsterreich (1868), p 110, Sternkreuz-Orden * : Dame of the Order of Queen Maria Luisa. ==AncestryReferencesExternal links== Category:1798 births Category:1881 deaths Category:House of Habsburg Category:Austrian princesses Category:House of Bourbon-Two Sicilies Category:Knights of the Order of Saint Stephen of Hungary Category:Dames of the Order of the Starry Cross Category:Dames of the Order of Queen Maria Luisa Category:Burials at the Basilica of Santa Chiara Category:Austrian Roman Catholics Category:18th-century Roman Catholics Category:19th-century Roman Catholics Category:Nobility from Vienna ","title":"Archduchess Clementina of Austria"},{"id":"5603574","text":"West Salem High School (also referred to as West Salem High, West Salem HS, or WSHS) is a public high school of the Salem-Keizer School District located in Salem, Oregon, United States. ==Academics== In 2008, 82% of the school's seniors received a high school diploma. Of 339 students, 279 graduated, 29 dropped out, five received a modified diploma, and 26 were still in high school the following year. As of 2017, 1,732 students were enrolled at West Salem High School. At that time, its graduation rate was 89%. The 2017 class of 414 had 37 dropouts, and 87% of the class were graduating on time. ==Maps Credit Union Education Branch== West Salem High School is one of three high schools in Salem, Oregon which are home to an education branch of Marion and Polk Schools Credit Union. MAPS Credit Union education branches provide an opportunity for high school students to participate in the day-to-day operations of a real credit union. Students in certain business classes spend a small amount of time conducting real teller transactions for other students during lunch hours, under the supervision of a trained faculty member. The school's branch has been open since 2003. ==Black football field== In 2012, West Salem installed a new black FieldTurf surface for its football field, believed to be the first of that color ever used for outdoor football (the Nebraska Danger of the Indoor Football League also use this color). The decision to use a black surface came about when the school's original green FieldTurf surface, installed in 2002, needed replacing. FieldTurf offered the school a discount of nearly $140,000 from the regular $437,000 replacement cost if it used an \\"unusual\\" color; West Salem chose black since it was a school color and also had not previously been used by another school. The school changed its home uniform color from black to green in order to avoid possible complaints by visiting teams about the uniforms blending into the field. The field and uniforms were fully paid for through fundraisers, including four local business sponsors. However, as of 2015, the school has now started to use black uniforms with grey numbers. As of 2020, the field has reverted back to green. == Land acknowledgement == West Salem High School resides on land belonging to the Kalapuya people. In 1855, treaty negotiations lead to this land being given to the United States of America in exchange for protections, the promise of a permanent reservation, and other guarantees. The Kalapuya people were removed to the Grande Ronde Reservation, and now make up part of the Confederated Tribes of Grande Ronde. ==See also== * Michael Stephen Lampert ==References== Category:High schools in Salem, Oregon Category:Educational institutions established in 2002 Category:High schools in Polk County, Oregon Category:2002 establishments in Oregon Category:Public high schools in Oregon ","title":"West Salem High School (Salem, Oregon)"},{"id":"5603593","text":"== Italian War of 1494‚Äì98 ==  Seminara   Fornovo  == Italian War of 1499‚Äì1504 ==  Ruvo   Cerignola   Garigliano  == War of the League of Cambrai ==  Agnadello   Padua   Polesella   Mirandola (1511)   Brescia  The Sack of Brescia took place on February 18, 1512 during the War of the League of Cambrai. The city of Brescia had revolted against French control, garrisoning itself with Venetian troops. Gaston de Foix, recently arrived to command the French armies in Italy, ordered the city to surrender; when it refused, he attacked it with around 12,000 men. The French attack took place in pouring rain, through a field of mud; Foix ordered his men to remove their shoes for better traction.Baumgartner, Louis XII, 220. The defenders inflicted heavy casualties on the French, but were eventually overrun, suffering 8,000 ‚Äì 15,000 casualties.Baumgartner, Louis XII, 220; Norwich, History of Venice, 421. Baumgartner gives 8,000 as a minimal estimate, while Norwich gives 15,000. The Gascon infantry and landsknechts then proceeded to thoroughly sack the city, massacring thousands of civilians over the next five days. Following this, the city of Bergamo paid some 60,000 ducats to the French to avoid a similar fate.  Ravenna   St. Mathieu   Novara   Guinegate   Flodden Field  The kingdoms of France and Scotland had traditionally enjoyed a close diplomatic relationship, reflected in a defensive treaty signed between the two kingdoms in 1512. When Henry crossed the English Channel to campaign in France, the King of France activated the treaty, sending arms, money and military advisers to James IV of Scotland to encourage him to fulfil his obligations, in the hope that this would draw English resources away from the invasion of France. James crossed the border with a force of some 35,000 men, including 5,000 French advisers.Guest, Ken, and Denise Guest, British Battles, p. 80 He was opposed by an English force under the Earl of Surrey. The two sides met on September 9, 1513, near the village of Flodden. The Scottish army was heavily defeated, losing some 9,000 men and many nobles, including King James, the King's illegitimate son, and twelve earls.Guest, Ken, and Denise Guest, British Battles, p. 85  La Motta  The Battle of La Motta, also known as the Battle of Schio, Battle of Vicenza or Battle of Creazzo, which took place on October 7, 1513 between the Republic of Venice and a combined Spanish and Imperial army, was a significant battle of the War of the League of Cambrai. A Venetian army under Bartolomeo d'Alviano attempted to prevent the Spanish and Imperials under Ram√≥n de Cardona from withdrawing from the Veneto, but was defeated and scattered.  Marignano  == Italian War of 1521‚Äì26 ==  Pampeluna  The Battle of Pampeluna (also spelled Pamplona) occurred on May 20, 1521, between French- backed Navarrese and Spanish troops, during the Spanish conquest of Iberian Navarre and in the context of the Italian War of 1521‚Äì26. Most Navarrese towns rose at once against the Spanish, who had invaded Navarre in 1512. The Spanish resisted the siege sheltered inside the city castle, but they eventually surrendered and the Navarrese took control of the town and the castle of Pamplona. It was at this battle that Inigo Lopez de Loyola, better known as St. Ignatius of Loyola, suffered severe injuries, a Navarrese cannonball shattering his leg. It is said that after the battle the Navarrese so admired his bravery that they carried him all the way back to his home in Loyola. His meditations during his long recovery set him on the road of a conversion of life from soldier to priest. He would eventually found the Society of Jesus (the Jesuits), and create the Spiritual Exercises, which is the basis for the idea of \\"retreats\\" as an experience of prayer as practiced in the Roman Catholic Church.  Noain-Esquiroz  The Battle of Noain-Esquiroz was fought near Pamplona on June 30, 1521, during the Italian War of 1521‚Äì26. A makeshift Spanish army consisting mostly of Castilian troops defeated the Navarrese and French forces sent by Henry d'Albret and commanded by Lesparre, driving them out of Iberian Navarre.  M√©zi√®res  The Siege of M√©zi√®res (1521) took place during the Italian War of 1521‚Äì26. An Imperial army besieged the city (now part of Charleville-M√©zi√®res), which was defended by French troops under the command of the Chevalier de Bayard and Anne de Montmorency; the siege was unsuccessful, and the determined French resistance gave Francis I time to concentrate his forces against Charles V.  Tournai  The Siege of Tournai (1521) took place during the Italian War of 1521‚Äì26. An Imperial army besieged the city of Tournai, capturing it from the French in late November; it would remain a Habsburg possession until the French conquest of the Austrian Netherlands in 1795.  Bicocca   Genoa  The Siege of Genoa (May 20, 1522 ‚Äì May 30, 1522) was conducted by an army of the Holy Roman Empire under the command of the Italian/Spanish General Fernando d'Avalos and Italian condottiero Prospero Colonna against the French forces defending the Italian city. Since Genoa had refused to surrender, the Imperial troops were permitted to loot the city once it had fallen.  Sesia  The Battle of the Sesia (April 30, 1524) was a battle in the Italian War of 1521‚Äì26 fought near the Sesia River that saw the Spanish-Imperial forces under Charles de Lannoy inflict a decisive defeat on the French under Admiral Bonnivet and the Francis de Bourbon, Comte de St. Pol, forcing the latter to withdraw from Lombardy.  Marseille  The Siege of Marseille (August‚ÄìSeptember 1524) was conducted by an Imperial army under Charles de Bourbon (who had recently betrayed Francis I) and Fernando de Avalos against the French defenders of Marseille. Although Avalos heavily looted the surrounding countryside, he was unsuccessful in seizing the city; and, faced with the arrival of French reinforcements, called off the siege in September.

D√ºren   Ceresole   Serravalle   St. Dizier  The Siege of St. Dizier took place in the summer of 1544, during the Italian War of 1542‚Äì46, when the Imperial army of Charles V attacked the French city of St. Dizier at the beginning of its advance into Champagne. The siege was already underway when Charles V himself arrived with an army of 14,100 (including 1600 sappers) on July 13. The next day an imperial commander, Ren√© of Ch√¢lon, Prince of Orange, was struck by a shot from the defenders, and died the next day with the Emperor by his bed (his title and lands going to his famous cousin, William the Silent). On July 23 French outposts near the besieged town were overrun, but a French army under the command of the Dauphin Henry maintained an observing position at Jalons. On August 17 the town surrendered. Charles elected not to attack the Dauphin's army and instead pressed on to Soissons.

Robin Hood p 73 (1982) Thames & Hudson. ==Synopsis== Robin Hood demands a toll of a potter (pavage) for crossing a bridge in Sherwood Royal Forest. They fight and the potter wins. Robin Hood strikes a deal with this Potter, who will stay in the Forest, while Robin disguises himself as the Potter and travels to Nottingham to sell the pots. He charges ridiculously low prices and so sells them all, in doing so the Sheriff's wife is intrigued and when Robin gives her his last pots for free she invites him to dinner with her and the sheriff. While at dinner the Sheriff's men are having an archery contest, Robin shows the Sheriff that he can shoot far better than the Sheriff's men, and he then explains that he can shoot that well because he was taught by Robin Hood. The sheriff asks him to lead him to the outlaw. Robin agrees, and when back in the forest the sheriff is ambushed by Robin's men. They take his money and his clothes, force him to spend a night in the forest (which he hates) and they force him to swear oaths that he would no longer hunt Robin and his Outlaw Band. Because of hospitality of the sheriff's wife in Nottingham, Robin lets him go free, telling him he must give his wife a white Palfrey. The story ends with the wife laughing at the Sheriff and exclaiming now Robin has been paid back for the pots he gave to her. ==Adaptations== This is the oldest existing instance of a motif to be common in latter ballads: Robin Hood meets his match.

Big Canoe is located between Jasper and Dawsonville and has about 3,000 residents. Approximately 60% are full-time and 40% are weekenders. ==History== Tate family In the 1830s, Samuel Tate, the owner of a hotel on Federal Road, discovered marble on his property and began buying up the surrounding land through the land lottery. In 1850, Tate entered a partnership which opened a quarry near the present-day town of Tate. By 1880, however, the Georgia marble industry was suffering. However, the construction of the Marietta and North Georgia Railway allowed the stone to reach new markets, and the Tate family founded the Georgia Marble Company in 1884 in response to growing business and newly interested investors. In 1905, Tate's grandson, Colonel Sam Tate, became president and general manager of the company, and oversaw a period of dramatic growth and profit. Colonel Tate was responsible for bringing numerous improvements to the area, including Wolfscratch School. The school was established and operated in the building now housing the Big Canoe tennis pro shop, and two large chimneys standing next to the real estate office are all that is left of a house built in 1913 for the school's principal and teachers. As other educational alternatives became available, the school was eventually closed. The house with the two chimneys became the primary residence of Steve and Lucille Tate until it burned down in 1959. Development Following the death of Steve Tate, the Wolfscratch property was sold. It lay unused for a number of years, until Cousins Properties in Atlanta and the Sea Pines Corporation of Hilton Head partnered to create the community of Big Canoe in 1972. Fifteen years later, in 1987, the Byrne Corporation assumed responsibility for developing and marketing the community, until 1997, when it merged with Greenwood Development Corporation as Big Canoe Company, LLC. ==Geography== Lake Petit, viewed from Mount Oglethorpe The community covers over 8,000 acres (32 km) in both Dawson and Pickens counties.

Rugby Canada is the administrative body for rugby union in Canada. Every province also has its own union. Canada has around 26,000 seniors and twice as many junior players spread across the country, the leading domestic competitions are the Americas Rugby Championship, a cross-border regional competition including the United States, Argentina, and Uruguay. The Rugby Canada National Junior Championship for under-20 players organised solely within Canada by Rugby Canada, the sports governing body, and the Canadian Rugby Championship, the top level of club rugby in the country. Canada is classified by World Rugby (WR) as a tier two rugby nation. Tier two nations do not have a full- time professional domestic structure in place, but they are considered by WR to be the most promising countries in which to expand the sport. The Canadian national side have competed in every Rugby World Cup to date yet have only won one match each tournament, with the exception of the 1991 tournament where they reached the quarterfinals, and 2015 and 2019, where they failed to win a single pool game. Canada's main problems have included the climate, because many grounds are under snow/ice for significant portions of the year, leading to a split season.Jones (1976), p21 Canada has long been a regional power in the sport, albeit in one of the sport's weaker regions. Argentina are the leading team in the Americas, usually followed by Canada, the United States and Uruguay. ==Popularity== Canadian Rugby Sevens fans at the 2016 Summer Olympics The sport is played across Canada, with clubs even in places like Yukon. It is most popular on Vancouver Island and the Lower Mainland in British Columbia on the west coast, and Newfoundland, where rugby is considered to be the most popular summer sport. It is also quite popular in Prince Edward Island, where it is played by far more people than Football, but is less popular than Baseball as a summer sport. Rugby in British Columbia has had a strong international flavour, with the University of British Columbia playing a regular series against the University of California, and representative BC sides have made tours to Japan and England. Up until just after the Second World War, rugby union was very popular on the west coast, and the east coast respectively. However, despite increasing interest in the Canadian football strongholds of Quebec and Ontario, rugby union was weakened in its western and eastern strongholds, particularly the latter. Despite its battle for survival, rugby has managed to maintain a presence in all parts of Canada. Rugby in the Central Provinces was reinforced partially by immigration from other Commonwealth Countries. Rugby in Canada has been experiencing a growing popularity. 20,396 fans came out to BMO Field in Toronto in June 2013 to watch Canada take on Ireland, a new attendance record for Canada.Rugby Mag, Ireland Defeats Canada on Big Night for Canadian Rugby, June 17, 2013, http://www.rugbymag.com/men/8400-ireland-defeats-canada-on-big-night-for- canadian-rugby.html ==History== Toronto Varsity rugby team, champions of Canada, c. 1906 There is a considerable overlap between the early history of rugby in Canada, and the origins of Canadian football. Early forms of rugby football were being played in Canada from 1823 onwards, in east Canadian towns such as Halifax, Montreal and Toronto.The Canadian Encyclopedia (1999, ), p2050 Rugby football proper in Canada dates back to the 1860s. Introduction of the game and its early growth is usually credited to settlers from Britain and the British army and navy in Halifax, Nova Scotia and Esquimalt, British Columbia. In 1864 the first recorded game of rugby in Canada took place in Montreal among artillery men. It is most likely that rugby got its start in British Columbia in the late 1860s or early 1870s when brief mentions of \\"football\\" appeared in print. F. Barlow Cumberland and Fred A. Bethune first codified rules for rugby football in Canada, in 1865 at Trinity College, Toronto, and the first proper Canadian game of rugby took place in 1865 when officers of an English regiment played local civilians, mainly from McGill University. Rugby is also an ancestor of Canadian football, currently its main competitor. A \\"running game\\", resembling rugby, was taken up by the Montreal Football Club in Canada in 1868. By the late 19th century, the game was popular in Vancouver on the west coast. Early Canadian rugby clubs included the following: * Montreal FC, founded 1868. * Halifax FC, founded 1870. * Winnipeg FC, founded 1879 * Vancouver RFC, founded 1889. The first major figure in the introduction of rugby to Canada was Alfred St. George Hamersley of Marlborough, an England international who had played in the first Calcutta Cup match in 1871, and he helped establish the game in British Columbia.Bath p64Jones (1976), p18 The game took root there, and as the Canadian Encyclopedia says: :\\"Vancouver, which, owing to its favourable climate and strong British tradition, became the game's stronghold.\\" The first recorded game in British Columbia was played on Vancouver Island in 1876, between members of the Royal Navy and the Army. It was played regularly after this in Victoria by local players and sailors on the British ships stationed at Esquimalt. The first club was formed in 1868. At that time no international agreed set of rules existed and the Rugby Football Union of England would not publish its official set of rules until 1871. Shortly after the game in Montreal, Trinity College, Toronto published the first set of Canadian rugby rules. The Canada RFU was founded in 1882, and administered Canadian football - after this, Canadian rugby fell back to a provincial level, taking administrative directions directly from the Rugby Football Union in England. Despite such encroachments, rugby remained popular in some parts of Canada, notably British Columbia, Nova Scotia, and Ontario, particularly around Toronto. As Canada's two main languages are English and French, it has long been influenced by not only the Commonwealth, but the French rugby community. As early as 1902, a Canadian XV toured the British Isles. And in 1908, the British Columbia rugby union team travelled to California to play the All Blacks. The Vancouver Crusaders RFC, city champions in 1911 There was a brief resurgence in the sport, but that was halted with the onset of World War I. From 1914 to 1919, only in British Columbia and Nova Scotia were there the numbers for semi-regular rugby. In most other areas the game was not played on a regular basis. It has been suggested that some kept rugby alive during the period in an effort to boost morale during the war. Following World War I, there was an increase in rugby in Canada, as servicemen rejoined their previous clubs. In 1919, a Canadian Services team, the Canadian Expeditionary Force, took part in an Inter-Services Championship played in Great Britain. The Championship consisted of matches played between six service teams from Australia, Britain, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa, with the final played at Twickenham. The Rugby Union of Canada was formed in 1929, which was followed by a tour of Japan by a Canadian side. During World War II the sport was only played on a limited basis, with most games being played involving mainly members of the Commonwealth Forces. In 1949, there were only three active provincial unions ‚Äî British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec. Queen's University RFC from Belfast, toured British Columbia in 1953.Jones, Encyclopedia of Rugby Football. (1966), p20 In 1958, the Carling Cup was set up, which was won by British Columbia, but which lay dormant between 1959-66. British Columbia retained the cup until Ontario won it in 1971. Canada first broke through into the top rank of rugby nations when it beat a touring Scotland side in 1991, and this was followed by an outstanding performance in the 1991 Rugby World Cup, in which they beat Romania and Fiji, and were narrowly beaten by France, reaching the quarterfinals. In 1992, they compounded their success by beating Wales 26-24. Although it was first introduced into eastern Canada, British Columbia has long been seen as the traditional centre of the Canadian game, and although there have often been as many players in Ontario as BC, there has been a steady drift westward of players. This westward drift has ensured that Canadian rugby now has an outlook to the Pacific Rim, rather than one merely fed by a heritage of largescale British emigration. Rugby and Canadian football An early Canadian football game between the Hamilton Tigers and an unknown Ottawa team, 1910. Note the lack of helmets. Confusingly, in Canada, Canadian football has also frequently been referred to as \\"rugby football\\",Rugby football in Encyclopedia Canadiana, p110. and a number of national and provincial bodies were called \\"Rugby Football Unions\\" or \\"Rugby Unions\\", such as the Ontario Rugby Football Union, Quebec Rugby Football Union. For example, in the Encyclopedia Canadiana, the entry Rugby Football begins \\"the Canadian development of rugby union or \\"English rugger\\" introduced into Canada in the third quarter of the nineteenth century.\\", but admits later that \\"the Canadian game is a radical departure from rugby union\\". Canadian football is in fact a descendant of the rugby code.\\"Rugby Union and Rugby League\\" in Encyclopedia Canadiana, p113.Encarta (1997) The first documented gridiron football match was a game played at University College, University of Toronto on November 9, 1861. A football club was formed at the university soon afterwards, although its rules of play at this stage are unclear. In 1864, at Trinity College, Toronto, F. Barlow Cumberland and Frederick A. Bethune devised rules based on rugby football. However, modern Canadian football is widely regarded as having originated with a game of rugby played in Montreal, in 1865, when British Army officers played local civilians. The game gradually gained a following, and the Montreal Football Club was formed in 1868, the first recorded non- university football club in Canada. This rugby-football soon became popular at Montreal's McGill University. McGill challenged Harvard University to a game, in 1874. It is through this varsity play that the game now known as American football entered the United States.gridiron football - Britannica Online Encyclopedia Predecessors of the Canadian Football League and the present-day governing body Football Canada include the Canadian Rugby Football Union (CRFU), established 1882, and the Canadian Rugby Union, established 1892. Representatives from the Montreal (Rugby) Football club (now known as the Westmount Rugby Club), the Toronto Rugby Football Club and from the Hamilton Rugby Football Club had meetings in Toronto and Montreal. It was decided that the union would continue to use the English rugby rules, and at the end of the season the winning club of the Quebec Championship would play the Ontario Champion for the Club Championship of the Dominion. This organization (also known at different times as the Canadian Rugby Union), was the forerunner of the Canadian Football League, as rugby football in Canada evolved into Canadian football. To make matters more confusing the word rugby continued to be applied to Canadian football. It was not until 1967 that the original CRU finally cleared up this confusion by renaming itself the Canadian Amateur Football Association; it adopted its current name of Football Canada in 1986. ==International competition== Canada is classified by World Rugby (WR) as a tier two rugby nation alongside Fiji, Japan, Romania, Samoa, Tonga and the USA (there are ten tier one rugby nations). In terms of international rugby, Canada has not been so isolated, since European sides touring Australia and New Zealand, and vice versa, would frequently stop off there, in the days before proper long distance jet flight. As early as 1905, Dave Gallaher's \\"Originals\\" from New Zealand played there, and a long line of All Blacks sides have played there. Rugby World Cup Canada National Rugby Squad, 1987 Rugby World Cup The Canadian national team have competed in every world cup since the first tournament held in 1987. The team's best result came during the 1991 tournament, held in the United Kingdom, when they reached the quarter finals beating out Fiji and Romania before narrowly losing 19-13 to France in the pool stage then New Zealand in the quarter final. Canada managed only one win in the 1987 Rugby World Cup (against Tonga). They also managed only a single win in 1995 Rugby World Cup (against Romania) 1999 Rugby World Cup (against Namibia) and the 2003 Rugby World Cup (against Tonga). Canada could only manage a draw in the 2007 Rugby World Cup (against Japan), but in the 2011 Rugby World Cup managed a win (against Tonga) and a draw (against Japan). Churchill Cup The Churchill Cup was a tournament conducted from 2003 through 2011, intended to help build depth in rugby in Canada and the United States, and an opportunity to develop new players for the England national team. The New Zealand MƒÅori also competed in most of the tournament's editions. Although Canada was one of the three regular teams in the Churchill Cup, they never made the final until 2010, losing out to the England Saxons (that country's \\"A\\" national side). They also lost to England Saxons in the final of the last Churchill Cup in 2011. Rugby Canada, USA Rugby, and the Rugby Football Union of England all agreed to end the Churchill Cup after the 2011 edition, as both Canada and the USA will be included in WR's international Test schedule starting in 2012. Super Powers Cup In 2004 and 2005 Canada replaced China in the Super Powers Cup. In 2005 Canada won the tournament beating Japan 15-10. The competition was discontinued in 2005 but representatives of Canada, USA, Russia and Japan have met to discuss reviving the competition, starting in November 2010. Americas Rugby Championship Rugby Canada participated in the Americas Rugby Championship, an annual competition established by WR and designed to help grow the sport in Canada and the USA. It was the successor to the North America 4, established in 2006 for the same purpose. The NA4 involved four regionally-based teams, two each from Canada and the USA. The ARC, launched in 2009, includes four Canadian teams: * BC Bears, representing British Columbia * Prairie Wolf Pack, representing the Prairie Provinces * Ontario Blues, representing Ontario * Atlantic Rock, representing Atlantic Canada plus Quebec These teams were joined by the Argentina Jaguars, which have now become the country's \\"A\\" (second-level) national team, and a \\"USA Select XV\\", an \\"A\\" national team in all but name. When the ARC was established, Rugby Canada decided to scrap its former semi-professional national competition, the Rugby Canada Super League. Pacific Nations Cup Starting in 2013, Canada (along with the United States) has joined the Pacific Nations Cup. The tournament is intended to strengthen the Tier 2 rugby nations along the Pacific Rim by providing competitive test matches in a tournament format. ==Domestic competitions== Canadian Rugby Championship The Canadian Rugby Championship (CRC) is an amateur rugby union league located in Canada, partially funded by World Rugby. It is the highest level of domestic rugby in Canada. It has four representative teams from regions across Canada, competing for the MacTier Cup. The regular season goes from August to September, and there is no post- season. The CRC was started in 2009 by Rugby Canada. The league continues to grow every year, with more games being added to the schedule, and the format having changed in each of its first three years, making the league more competitive, and a prospect of becoming professional one day. Canadian Direct Insurance Premier League The Canadian Direct Insurance Premier League (also known as the CDI Premier League) is a provincial rugby union competition contested by eight clubs in British Columbia, Canada. The CDI Premier League is organized by the British Columbia Rugby Union. The Canadian Direct Insurance Premier League runs from January to April each year. The teams that play in the CDI Premier League compete in the Lower Mainland Spray League and the Vancouver Island Elite League from September to December. The teams compete for the Rounsefell Cup. The Rounsefell Cup was first awarded to Vancouver Rowing Club in 1922, and has been competed for annually ever since. Major League Rugby (2017‚Äì ) In November 2015, the Professional Rugby Organization (PRO Rugby) announced a USA Rugby and World Rugby-sanctioned professional rugby championship. Six teams in \\"major metropolitan areas in the US Northeast, the Rocky Mountains and California\\" will play at medium-size venues, with a 10-match schedule from April to July 2016. The league was expected to include Canadian teams upon expansion in 2017, but has since folded.http://blogs.theprovince.com/2015/11/09/prorugby-coming-to-north- america-but-canada-has-to- wait/https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/nov/09/us-professional-rugby- union-league In 2018, the top-level competition of rugby in the United States became Major League Rugby, and the Ontario Arrows were announced to join in the 2019 season. ==Age Grade Rugby== The Junior Inter-Provincial Championship was started in 1976, and in 1982, Canada started up a junior national team, which played Welsh Schoolboys in 1983 and 1986, and England Colts in 1985. Since 2009, the top age-grade competition in the country is the Rugby Canada National Junior Championship, involving under-20 teams. It was established as a replacement for the Super League, and most of the clubs that fielded teams in that league now send under-20 teams to the National Junior Championship. ==Women's Rugby in Canada== In 1983, the Western Canada Women's Championship was established. By 1999, thirty women's clubs were registered in Canada. ==See also== *Rugby Canada *Canada national rugby union team *Sports in Canada *Canada national rugby sevens team *Canadian Rugby Championship ==External links== * Rugby Canada site * Rugby in Canada Dot Com * Archives du Rugby: Canada * Rugby on the Canadian Encyclopedia ==References== * Bath, Richard (ed.)

Henricus Stephanus, Paris, 1572). The Greek‚ÄìSpanish Dictionary resumes this tradition at the level reached by its immediate predecessor, Liddell-Scott-Jones's A Greek‚ÄìEnglish Lexicon (LSJ) dictionary in its ninth edition (Oxford 1925-1940). Through many years, this project, carried out in the Department of Classics of the Institute of Philology at the Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient√≠ficas (CSIC) in Madrid, has received funds from the Spanish Ministry of Education in several ways, lately through Acciones Especiales. It also has been supported at several times by groups such as Fundaci√≥n March and Fundaci√≥n A. G. Leventis. In the beginning, the goals aimed for were not as ambitious as today. Having in mind an audience of university students, the editors basically attempted to adapt into Spanish the best existing Greek dictionaries. They also intended to supplement them in neglected fields, replace their older editions with newer ones and correct mistakes. Nevertheless, at the very beginning of the work, classical philologists had felt the need for a new bilingual dictionary from Ancient Greek into a modern language. Such a dictionary necessarily had to be based on a wider collection of materials, as well as on a new careful study and organization of those materials according to modern lexicographical criteria, taking advantage of recent advances in linguistics. Earlier editions of LSJ's dictionary, though regularly used by Greek scholars, were in many senses out of date, in spite of supplements, and the Greek lexicon required a thorough revision. That revision involved, first, incorporating Mycenaean Greek and Patristic writings, as well as personal and place names, which were all absent from the LSJ. Besides the increasing mass of words showing up in new literary and documentary texts, new critical editions of well-known texts and the necessary revision of their interpretation in the light of the current state of the art mandated a dictionary on new foundations. As for the etymological element, the tremendous development of Indo-European linguistics all through the 20th century had also to be taken into account. ==See also== * Comparison of Ancient Greek dictionaries ==External links== *Diccionario Griego‚ÄìEspa√±ol *Online: Greek‚ÄìSpanish Dictionary (DGE), G Category:Translation dictionaries ","title":"Diccionario Griego-Espa√±ol"},{"id":"5603655","text":"Assyrian clothing varies from village to village throughout the Assyrian homeland and beyond. ==Dates== The earliest type of costume here is a rather elaborate shawl drapery worn without any tunic underneath. Later comes the tunic with various-fringed shawl draperies worn in addition, and some of the latest types have the tunic worn alone without the shawl draperies. The dates given for the costumes illustrated in this style have been verified at the British Museum. It should be remembered, as in the case of ancient Egyptians costume, that the dresses changed very slowly indeed, and most styles of this era were worn literally for hundreds of years. ==Cutting out== The knee-length and full-length tunics with short sleeves are the most common dress worn to different types of headdress. There were essentially only two types of garment generally found in the representations of ancient Assyrian costume: the shawl and the tunic. These vary in size and proportion, and are worn either alone, but more generally in combination. ==Material== Traditional clothing from the region of Zakho The most common material for clothing was wool, although linen had been known from an early period and was often used for better-quality garments. Cotton did not become available until Sennacherib introduced it into Assyria in about 700 BC, from which time it was used for the making of cloth. Other materials sometimes used were leather and papyrus. The skins and furs of animals and metal were also in use, but chiefly for military and hunting costume. ==Coloring== Though the actual specimens of these costumes are not possessed, it can still be inferred from the lavish ornament and, from references in the Old Testament writings that rich coloring prevailed. The dyes were probably similar to those of ancient Egypt, and this table will suggest the particular hue of each color: *Blue: Usually rather dark indigo, sometimes paler. *Red: Much like the color known as Indian red. *Yellow: Similar to yellow ochre. *Green: Much like the paint known as green bice, but rather more dull. *Purple: Dark, and quite a brownish hue of purple. All these colors could be used as embroideries on a white or natural colored ground of linen, the embroideries being of wool. In other cases the whole garment might be colored throughout. ==Decoration== Except in earliest examples, decoration is lavish in Assyrian costume, in fact, the costume of a king when at its richest may be said to be absolutely covered with ornament. Jewelry, woven and embroidered patterns, and fringes are used in the utmost profusion. Other decorations may include Bracelets, earrings, Various forms of Tassels, Winged globe, Palm tree, Lappet (king's tiara), Vessels, Sword handles, Footwear. ==Assyrian characteristics== Some of the Assyrian characteristics may include: The sacred tree, repeated patterns and borders on costumes, various types of rosettes much used in Assyrian decorations. These would be either woven or embroidered. ==Differences between male and female clothing== The representations of costume which Assyrian art has left are almost entirely those of men's dress. Two examples of women's dresses are a plain ungirded tunic and a simply draped shawl covering the figure partially. The second is a dress of a Queen, and has the tunic almost entirely covered with a voluminous shawl. The wide belt with narrow belt over it seems to be confined to the men's costume, as also the tighter and scantier shawl draperies, which exist in singular variety. ==Gallery== Traditional Assyrian clothing of the men of the Tyari region.

A broad cloth, \\"Kammar band,\\" or waist band, is folded several times round the trunk of the body, and a short cut-away jacket of amazing colors, worn over a thin cotton variegated shirt. The head- dress consists of conical felt cap as depicted in frescoes of Assyrians of thousands of years ago, and which has survived to this day.\\"Brigadier-Gen. H.H. Austin, \\"The Baqubah Refugee Camp\\", The Faith Press, london 1920. *\\"There are 115 guests today. Among them are a number of Tyari men, whose wild looks, combined with the splendour of their dress and arms, are of great interest. Their jackets are one mass of gold embroidery, their shirts, with hanging sleeves, are striped satin; their trousers, of sailor cut, are silk, made from the cocoons of their own silkworms, woven with broad crimson stripes on a white ground, on which is a zigzag pattern; and their handsome jackboots are of crimson leather. With their white or red peaked felt hats and twisted silk pagris or head-cloths, their rich girdles, jewelled daggers, and inlaid pistols, they are very imposing.\\"Bird, Isabella. \\"Journeys in Persia and Kurdistan, including a summer in the Upper Karun region and a visit to the Nestorian rayahs\\".

Zikim Training Base) is a training base (Bahad) belonging to the Israel Defense Forces. Zikim is located 8 km south of Ashkelon. It was named after the nearby kibbutz Zikim. The majority of new recruits in Zikim pass the Rifleman 02 recruit training (tironut) which has all but replaced the older 00 level that was usually reserved for non-combat woman recruits. ==History== Bahad 4 was founded in 1949 as the main IDF recruit training base, for all types of recruits (combat and non-combat). It was originally located in Tzrifin, but after the Six-Day War it was moved to the Beit El base in the newly captured West Bank. After the Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip signed in 1995, the base was moved to Zikim. Qassam fire, evacuation and return Bahad 4 is one of the few Israeli military bases under threat of short-range Qassam rockets fired from the Gaza Strip, and has endured numerous barrages. On September 11, 2007, a Qassam rocket hit an empty tent, causing injuries to soldiers in neighboring tents. Four soldiers were seriously wounded and a further 63 were treated for moderate to light wounds and shock. One soldier, Avi Dorfman, was critically brain-injured, and his miraculous recovery was chronicled in the Israeli news. Following the incident, pressure was put on the IDF by parents to stop training recruits at the base. On November 19, 2008, Zikim was evacuated as part of a plan presented by Deputy Chief of Staff Dan Harel to remove general recruit training bases. Following Operation Cast Lead, Qassam attacks decreased significantly, and returning recruits to Zikim became a viable option. In late 2009, after a severe shortage of space in the other basic training bases, several companies were placed at Zikim, and more are expected to be recreated in 2009‚Äì2010. ==Structure and board== The base comprises 9 companies for any kinds of troops.

He is currently serving as an assistant coach for the Hawthorn Football Club. Originally from Northam, Western Australia, he attended Carine Senior High School. Glass began his career with in the West Australian Football League (WAFL), before being recruited by West Coast with the 11th pick in the 1999 National Draft, making his debut for the club the following season. Playing mainly as a full-back, Glass was named in the All-Australian team on four occasions, including as captain of the 2012 team. He was named captain of West Coast in 2008, after Chris Judd was traded to , and won club best and fairest awards in 2007, 2009, and 2011. Glass retired from football midway through the 2014 season, having played 270 games for West Coast. ==Career== Playing He was recruited as the number 11 draft pick in the 1999 AFL Draft from Perth and made his debut for the Eagles in Round 4, 2000 against Adelaide. Glass, who had a relatively low profile in a team of well known stars such as Ben Cousins, Chris Judd, and Daniel Kerr, was named as the All-Australian full- back in 2006. He had another excellent 2007 season where he won West Coast's Club Champion Award and his second All-Australian selection. On 9 November 2007, Glass was announced as the new captain of West Coast with the departure of Chris Judd to Victoria. Glass was appointed to lead the recovery of the club after a series of off-field scandals. West Coast had a poor year in his first year of captaincy, suffering from the loss of Judd and Cousins as well as from injuries to key players, including Glass himself.

A midfielder, he represented Sunderland in the Premier League, forming part of their Championship title- winning team of 1998-99. He later played for Barnsley and Carlisle United, where he won the 2005 Conference National play-off Final and the 2005-06 Football League Two Championship title. A short spell at Darlington followed, before he was forced to retire through injury in July 2010. During his time at Sunderland, he also played on loan for Blackpool, Crewe Alexandra and Barnsley. ==Club career== Sunderland AFC Lumsdon began his career at Sunderland, making his first-team debut against Wolverhampton Wanderers on 7 February 1998. In the same week, he signed a five-year professional contract, and was also called up to the England under-18 squad. He was part of the Sunderland squad that won the Championship title in the 1998‚Äì99 season under manager Peter Reid, although he didn't make an appearance in the League that season (his sole appearance coming in the League Cup on 27 October, where he came on as a late substitute for Martin Smith in a 2‚Äì1 victory over Grimsby Town). After Sunderland were promoted to the Premier League, Lumsdon impressed in pre-season matches against Rangers and Sampdoria in the centre of midfield. He made his Premiership debut on the first day of the 1999-2000 season against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. Lumsdon remained part of the first-team squad over the next three seasons, as Sunderland enjoyed consecutive 7th-place finishes. A loan spell to Blackpool was arranged in 2000, in order that he gain first team experience. A successful sixteen-match loan at Crewe Alexandra in the Championship followed, with manager Dario Gradi submitting bids in the region of ¬£500,000 for his services. His final game for Sunderland was a League Cup encounter against Walsall on 14 September 1999. He played the full game in a 3‚Äì2 win. He left the club having made four appearances in all competitions. Barnsley Lumsdon signed for Championship side Barnsley for ¬£500,000 in December 2001, with substantial add-on fees attached to the deal based on appearances. He went on to make 28 starts from October in his first season in the Championship, scoring 9 goals. He collected the Supporters' Player of the Year award after strong performances, especially against Wolves and Portsmouth. However, although his form was good, his contract stipulated that Sunderland would receive a payment from Barnsley after Lumsdon made a certain number of appearances; as Barnsley were enduring financial difficulty, they could not afford to select Lumsdon on several occasions. Carlisle United In 2004, Lumsdon joined Paul Simpson's ambitious Carlisle United, where his wages were funded by former Gretna owner Brooks Mileson. He played a major part in the Cumbrians' promotion through the play-offs back into the Football League, winning sixteen man of the match awards at Brunton Park, and collecting the Players' Player of the Year award as well as Paul Simpson's Manager's Player of the Year. A year later, he was again another major part of the team who were runaway winners of the League Two title, in which he won the League 2 Player of the Month award twice. He also played at the Millennium Stadium against Swansea City in a 2‚Äì1 defeat in the Football League Trophy final. The 2007‚Äì08 season was a near miss for Carlisle and Lumsdon; he excelled on the pitch, but Carlisle were narrowly beaten by Leeds United in the play-off semi-finals through a late Jonny Howson goal. At the season's conclusion, he was rated the top midfielder in the Premier League and Football League by The Sunday Sun newspaper, beating Nicky Butt, Scott Parker and Julio Arca to this title. In a pre-season match in the summer of 2008 against Partick Thistle, Lumsdon suffered a serious back injury; in his absence, Carlisle struggled in League One, but he managed to make six appearances towards the end of the 2008‚Äì09 season upon his return. Lumsdon left Carlisle United in May 2009, when he was one of six players released by the club due to budget constraints. Darlington Upon his release by Carlisle, Lumsdon joined Darlington in League Two; however, after only three games, he had a recurrence of his previous back injury. In July 2010, Lumsdon retired from football at the age of 30 due to injury. ==After football== Following his retirement from football, Lumsdon works for BBC Radio Cumbria as part of their Carlisle United commentary team, and writes weekly articles for the News and Star publication for Cumbria. He has also been employed by Carlisle United as their club ambassador. ==Honours== *Sunderland **Championship Title winner: 1998‚Äì99 *Barnsley Football Club **Supporters Player of the Year: 2001‚Äì02 *Carlisle United **National Conference play off final winner: 2004‚Äì05 **League Two Title winner: 2005‚Äì06 **Football League Trophy runner-up: 2005‚Äì06 **Managers Player of the Year: 2005‚Äì06 **Players Player of the Year: 2005‚Äì06 **Player of the Year: 2007‚Äì08 ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:1979 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Newcastle upon Tyne Category:English footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:Sunderland A.F.C. players Category:Blackpool F.C. players Category:Barnsley F.C. players Category:Crewe Alexandra F.C. players Category:Carlisle United F.C. players Category:Darlington F.C. players Category:Premier League players Category:English Football League players Category:National League (English football) players ","title":"Chris Lumsdon"},{"id":"5603704","text":"Candida is a 1970 album by Dawn, a studio session group including Tony Orlando, Toni Wine, and Linda November.

He has previously played for Aberdeen, Derby County, Sheffield Wednesday, Rotherham United, Oxford United and Bury, and also for Kilmarnock, Portsmouth, Coventry City and Oxford in loan spells. He made two international appearances for Scotland in 2011. ==Club career== Aberdeen Maguire made his debut for Aberdeen on 7 May 2006, coming on as a substitute in their final match of the 2005‚Äì06 season, where he set up John Stewart for the equaliser in a 2‚Äì2 draw against SPL champions Celtic. His first starting appearance in the senior team was on 26 December against Kilmarnock, where he also scored his first senior goal in the sixth minute. The following season, Maguire scored some vital goals, including a 94th-minute winner in a thrilling 4‚Äì3 match against Inverness CT on 29 March 2008 and a brace in the 2‚Äì1 win over Falkirk five days later. On 16 July 2008, Maguire signed a three-year contract extension with the Dons. In February 2009, having been regularly kept out of the starting eleven by first-choice striking pair Darren Mackie and Lee Miller, Maguire requested to go out on loan in search of regular first-team football. After this request was promptly turned down, Maguire scored two goals in Aberdeen's 5‚Äì0 Scottish Cup victory over East Fife. Kilmarnock (loan) During the January transfer window in 2010, Maguire moved on loan to Kilmarnock, reuniting him with former Aberdeen boss Jimmy Calderwood. On his debut against Celtic, he scored the only goal of the game to give Kilmarnock their first league win in eight games. Maguire's form after signing saw him win the Scottish Premier League Young Player of the Month award for February 2010. He scored 4 goals in 14 games to help Kilmarnock stay in the Scottish Premier League. Derby County On 1 June 2011, it was announced Maguire would sign for English Championship side Derby County on the expiration of his Aberdeen contract, having agreed a three-year deal with Derby. The transfer was formally completed on 29 June when Derby agreed a compensation package with Aberdeen, speculated to be in the region of ¬£400,000. Maguire's first start, and first goal, came on 29 October, in a 3‚Äì1 win over Portsmouth. He was subsequently praised for his patience and work ethic by first-team coach Andy Garner, having been kept out of the team by the form of fellow strikers Jamie Ward, Theo Robinson and Steve Davies. However, he failed to cement a place in the first team, finding himself behind strikers Theo Robinson, Steve Davies, Jamie Ward and youth product Callum Ball. Maguire scored a hat-trick against Pinxton in a 4‚Äì0 win during the quarter final of the Derbyshire Senior Cup. Portsmouth (loan) On 9 March 2012, Maguire joined Championship strugglers Portsmouth on a month-long emergency loan. He wore the number 22 shirt during his time at Fratton Park.

Maguire received praise from Portsmouth manager Michael Appleton for his role in a 2‚Äì0 win against Hull City on 27 March 2012 and hoped for an extension to his loan. After one month at Pompey, the club extended Maguire's loan until the end of the season. Maguire impressed for Portsmouth where he scored 3 goals in 11 appearances, and picked up the club's Player of the Month award in the game against parent club Derby County (a game which Maguire was ineligible to play in) on 21 April 2012, a game which saw Portsmouth relegated in a 2‚Äì1 defeat. Sheffield Wednesday On 22 May 2012, Maguire was transfer-listed by Derby. Sheffield Wednesday, newly promoted to the Championship, had two bids rejected to buy Maguire in May 2012 but on 21 June 2012, they announced that Maguire had joined them on a three-year deal. He made his Owls debut in the 4‚Äì2 League Cup win over Oldham Athletic on 13 August. However Maguire had to wait until 16 March 2013 for another league appearance in the 0‚Äì2 defeat against Cardiff City. When right midfielder Michail Antonio was brought down and injured, Maguire came on as substitute. Maguire made his second league appearance, again as substitute, in the 2‚Äì1 victory against South Yorkshire rivals Barnsley. Maguire made a fourth appearance for the Owls in a 3‚Äì2 victory over Blackburn Rovers, replacing Jermaine Johnson in the 84th minute.

The following week on 25 April 2015, Maguire scored his eighth and final goal of 2014‚Äì15 against Yorkshire rivals Leeds United, which was again from the penalty spot; Wednesday went on to lose the game 2‚Äì1. Coventry City (loan) On 28 November 2013, Maguire signed on loan for Coventry City until 5 January 2014.

Oxford United (loan) On 26 November 2015, Maguire signed a two-month loan deal with Oxford United. He made six League appearances, played in a notable victory over Premier League side Swansea City in the third round of the FA Cup, and scored against Yeovil Town in the area semi-finals of the Football League Trophy. Oxford United On 1 February 2016, Maguire's contract with Rotherham was terminated by mutual agreement, and on the same day he signed a contract with Oxford until the end of the 2015‚Äì16 season. Maguire scored 4 league goals in 2015‚Äì16, all during the final six games of the season culminating in Oxford's promotion to League One. After prolonged negotiations he signed a further one-year deal in July 2016. He scored a career-best 17 goals for Oxford in 2016‚Äì17 but declined their offer of a new contract. Bury Maguire signed for Bury in July 2017 on a free transfer. Sunderland On 22 June 2018, Maguire signed a two- year deal with EFL League One side Sunderland.

He worked in exploring transpersonal psychology, and wrote about the concept of subpersonality. Rowan was a qualified individual and group psychotherapist (UKAHPP and UKCP), a Chartered counseling psychologist (BPS) and was an accredited counsellor (BACP). He worked in private practice in London. He described his therapeutic approach as humanistic, existential, authentic, relational and transpersonal. He was an exponent of the idea of the dialogical self, a later development of subpersonalities theory. ==Early life== Rowan was born in Wiltshire at a hospital near Ford. He started his life at the Old Sarum Airfield, Salisbury where his father was a squadron leader in the British Royal Air Force. Consequently, his childhood was spent in a number of different air force stations. Whilst the family was in Cairo, his brother was born in a taxi. ==Career== When he reached the age of eighteen in 1943, Rowan was called up to serve in the British Army. Part of his service during the Second World War was in India, where he gained formative experiences. Rowan spent several years working in different occupations including encyclopedia sales, teaching, telecommunications, accountancy, research, and other office-based jobs. In 1950, he became involved in the work of the Walsby Association on systematic ideology. He lived and worked with Harold Walsby in 1950, and in 1951 and joined the Socialist Party of Great Britain (SPGB) in order to learn the rudiments of Marxism. He became the editor of the SPGB's internal journal, Forum but left the Party over the Turner Controversy. After gaining a degree, Rowan built a career in market research. He held the position of Managing Director at the Bureau of Commercial Research. In 1969, he began his group work by co-leading workshops in a pioneering group called B Now which ran from his home in Finchley, north London. In the same year Rowan joined the Association for Humanistic Psychology (AHP), which he would eventually chair. During 1971, he co-led groups at Centre 42 in Kensington, and then later in 1972 at the Kaleidoscope Centre in Swiss Cottage. In 1975, he studied co- counselling, and practiced this method for five years. He later became a teacher of the Barefoot Psychoanalyst model. In 1976, he published Ordinary Ecstasy. This work is a summary and guide to all the branches of Humanistic psychology. He also helped to produce the radical men's magazine Achilles Heel. In 1978, he helped to found, with Giora Doron, the Hampstead-based Institute of Psychotherapy and Social Studies. During 1978, Rowan became interested in Primal Integration, training with this movement's founder Bill Swartley. Rowan then offered this therapy as part of his practice. In 1980, Rowan helped to found the Association for Humanistic Psychology Practitioners, later to be known as the UK Association of Humanistic Psychology Practitioners. In 1989, Rowan co-founded the Serpent Institute with Jocelyn Chaplin. Both taught humanistic and psychodynamic theories and practices. On the closure of this institute four years later, he joined the Minster Centre, where he worked for ten years. Whilst there he trained psychotherapists, lead seminars, experiential training groups and supervision groups. He left the Centre in 2004, and worked in private practice, as well as provided master classes and workshops. ==Education== During childhood, Rowan went to a number of different schools as a consequence of his father's career in the British Royal Air Force. One such was King's School, Chester, where he was in the class of 1939. In the 1950s, Rowan gained a London University diploma in sociology, and was awarded a joint honours degree in philosophy and psychology from Birkbeck College. From 1970‚Äì79, Rowan studied with a variety of practitioners including John Adams, James Elliott, Bernard Gunther, Paul Lowe, Elizabeth Mintz, Al and Diane Pesso, John Pierrakos, Will Schutz, Julian Silverman, Jay Stattman, and Denny Yuson. In 2006, he was awarded a Ph.D in transpersonal psychology from Middlesex University. ==Honours== John Rowan was a Fellow of the British Psychological Society (member of the Psychotherapy Section, the Counselling Psychology Division, the Transpersonal Psychology Section, and the Consciousness and Experience Section). He was also a Fellow of the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP). As a founding member of the UK Association of Humanistic Psychology Practitioners, he was named an Honorary Life Member. He was an Honorary Fellow of the United Kingdom Council for Psychotherapy and was a past member of its governing board, representing the Humanistic and Integrative Section. ==Personal life== Rowan and his wife Sue lived in North Chingford, London. He had four children and four grandchildren from a previous marriage that ended in divorce in 1978. ==Publications== Author * The Science of You (Psychological Aspects of Society Book 1) (Davis-Poynter 1973) * The Social Individual (Psychological Aspects of Society Book 2) (Davis-Poynter 1973) * The Power of the Group (Psychological Aspects of Society Book 3) (Davis-Poynter 1976) * Ordinary Ecstasy: Humanistic Psychology in Action (Routledge and Kegan Paul 1976) * The Reality Game:A Guide to Humanistic Counseling and Psychotherapy (Routledge and Kegan Paul 1976) * The Structured Crowd (Psychological Aspects of Society Book 4) (Davis-Poynter 1978) * A Guide To Humanistic Psychology (Association for Humanistic Psychology in Britain 1987) * The Horned God (Routledge & Kegan Paul 1987) * Subpersonalities: The people Inside Us (Routledge 1990) * Breakthroughs and Integration in Psychotherapy (Whurr 1992) * Discover Your Subpersonalities: Our Inner World and the People In It (Routledge 1993) * The Transpersonal: Spirituality in Psychotherapy and Counselling (Routledge 1993) * Healing the Male Psyche: Therapy as Initiation (Routledge 1997) * The Therapist's Use of Self with Michael Jacobs (Open University Press 2002) * The Future of Training in Psychotherapy and Counselling: Instrumental, Relational and Transpersonal Perspectives (Routledge 2005) * Personification: Using the Dialogical Self in Psychotherapy and Counselling (Routledge 2010) Editor * Human Inquiry: A Sourcebook of New Paradigm Research with Peter Reason (Wiley 1976) * Innovative Therapy in Britain with Windy Dryden (Wiley 1988) * The Plural Self: Multiplicity in Everyday Life with Mick Cooper (SAGE 1998) He was on the Editorial Board of the following periodicals. * Self & Society: An International Journal for Humanistic Psychology; link to journal * The Transpersonal Psychology Review; link to journal * Counseling Psychology Review; link to journal * Journal of Humanistic Psychology; link to journal Papers * List of papers: ==See also== * Personification ==ReferencesExternal links== * The George Walford International Essay Prize website has a brief biography. * Category:1925 births Category:2018 deaths Category:Alumni of Middlesex University Category:Alumni of Birkbeck, University of London Category:British psychologists Category:British psychotherapists Category:Humanistic psychologists Category:Socialist Party of Great Britain members Category:Transpersonal psychologists ","title":"John Rowan (psychologist)"},{"id":"5603756","text":"Samuel Butler (born 14 January 1986) is a former professional Australian rules footballer who played for the West Coast Eagles in the Australian Football League (AFL).

A Highfield lever is a lever device which allows tension to be rapidly set up in a wire and equally rapidly released to the required extent. It is frequently used in sailing boats where tension in some part of the rigging needs to be adjusted to a pre-set amount as the wind impinges on one side of the sails or the other. It is typically used in running backstays (runners). To make it work in this application, the backstay is led through a block or fairlead along the deck to a two-legged, second order lever mounted with its fulcrum above deck level. The end of the runner is attached to a cross-member between the two legs and part way along the lever. When the lever is moved away from the fairlead, tension is placed on the runner on a line below the fulcrum so that the lever is pulled down onto the deck. When the tension is to be released, the lever is thrown towards the fairlead. When released, the amount of slack in the runner is therefore twice the distance of the attachment point from the fulcrum. It is not necessary to have great leverage as the adjustment is made at a point in the manoeuvring of the boat when the rigging is slack. The significant point is that the lever should be designed to take up the required amount of slack. It is possible to arrange a Highfield lever to work two backstays or shrouds by mounting the lever transversely so that it is thrown from side to side rather than fore and aft, tensioning the rigging on one side of the boat as it relaxes the other. In other applications the lever can be mounted on a stay itself; such an application can be seen in the accompanying illustration. The Highfield lever was invented by J. S. Highfield, an electrical engineer and rear-commodore with the Royal Thames Yacht Club, in about 1930. http://www.ybw.com/cb/gloss.html#Highfield https://books.google.com/books?id=Fp63wWByImQC&pg;=PA145&lpg;=PA145&dq;=%22Highfield+lever%22&source;=web&ots;=dtOvGn79kw&sig;=vDH04nBiAXxluXvIdcGcUdh3i_U&hl;=en&sa;=X&oi;=book_result&resnum;=3&ct;=result (The Language of Sailing - Richard Mayne) Category:Sailing rigs and rigging ","title":"Highfield lever"},{"id":"5603793","text":"Derek Holmes (born 18 October 1978) is a Scottish former professional footballer, who played for Heart of Midlothian, Cowdenbeath, Raith Rovers, Ross County, Bournemouth, Carlisle United, Rotherham United, St Johnstone, Queen of the South, Airdrie United, Arbroath and East Fife.

He was sentenced to nine months in federal prison. DEA agents raided Chong's Pacific Palisades, California home on the morning of February 24, 2003. The raid was part of Operation Pipe Dreams and \\"Operation Headhunter,\\" which resulted in raids on 100 homes and businesses nationwide that day and indictments of 55 individuals. The film was shown at film festivals in 2005 and 2006 and had its first, art-house theatrical release on June 14, 2006 at the Film Forum in New York City. The film features appearances by Bill Maher and Jay Leno, who express support for Chong and outrage over federal handling of the incident. Eric Schlosser, author of Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market, provides \\"a much needed dollop of historical and political context\\". The film was presented on the Showtime cable network on November 9, 2008.According to the director, it was shown over 100 times as of September 5, 2010: The film received positive reviews. ==Synopsis== The film depicts Tommy Chong of Cheech and Chong and his legal problems with The Department of Justice. Filmmaker Josh Gilbert follows the tale of Chong as he becomes a target in a government sting, code named \\"Operation Pipe Dreams\\". Tommy Chong was the only defendant without a prior conviction to receive a jail sentence. The federal government stated that the reason that it sought this harsh punishment was because the comedy movie Up In Smoke trivialized the government's anti-drug efforts. The documentary discloses that Tommy Chong's son, who actually ran the company which sold the paraphernalia was never charged or indicted by the Federal government. In May 2008 federal agents raided the owner of the distribution rights to this DVD. The documentary is critical of the prosecution of Chong by the U.S. federal government led by the U.S. attorney for western Pennsylvania, Mary Beth Buchanan. ==Production credits== *Director ‚Äì Josh Gilbert *Screenplay ‚Äì Josh Gilbert *Producer ‚Äì Josh Gilbert *Executive Producers ‚Äì A.

The greenback cutthroat, once widespread in the Arkansas and South Platte River drainages of Eastern Colorado and Southeast Wyoming, today occupies less than 1% of its historical range. It is currently listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. It was adopted as the state fish of Colorado on March 15, 1994 replacing the unofficial rainbow trout. ==Description== The greenback cutthroat's maximum size is . It has the largest spots of all cutthroats and is reported to have the most brilliant spawning coloration. Like all cutthroats, it has red coloration in the area of the lower jaw and throat. Historically, it has been reported to grow as large as . ==Natural history== The cutthroat trout is thought to have evolved over the past two million years from other Oncorhynchus species which migrated up the Columbia and Snake river basins to the Green and Yellowstone river basins. Within the past 20,000 years, a population which crossed the Continental Divide during the most recent ice age gave rise to the greenback cutthroat. The greenback cutthroat trout today is found east of the Continental Divide in the cold, clear foothill and mountain waters of the Arkansas and South Platte Rivers. Although it was common in the late 19th century, ranging along the Front Range from Wyoming to New Mexico, it began to decline when settlers arrived in the area. Mining in its native river basins led to sediment and toxic runoff in the water. These factors, along with water diversion for agriculture and overfishing, led to the decline of many greenback cutthroat trout populations. The introduction of non-native species such as brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), brown trout (Salmo trutta), and rainbow trout (O. mykiss) was also detrimental to the greenback cutthroat. The former two species competed with greenback cutthroats while the latter hybridized with it, creating cutbows. Other subspecies of cutthroat were introduced to greenback habitat, further damaging populations due to hybridization. ==Conservation== The species was originally thought to have been discovered in 1857 by William A. Hammond, an Army surgeon accompanying troops west during the early Indian Wars in 1857. As a corresponding member of the Academy of Natural Sciences at Drexel University in Philadelphia, he sent back crates of specimens that he collected back there for eventual identification and study. The crates with the trout specimens were labeled as having come from \\"the South Platte River at Fort Riley, Kansas\\". This caused some confusion when the specimens were first examined in the 1870s by Edward Drinker Cope, who first identified them as greenbacks, since the river does not flow through anywhere in Kansas. Two decades later, David Starr Jordan, one of the leading ichthyologists of his day, resolved the apparent impossibility by deciding that Hammond must have collected them on a trip to Fort Bridger, in the Green River basin in southwestern Wyoming, which would have likely taken him along the South Platte. Although the greenback cutthroat was considered extinct by the 1930s, in 1957 a population was discovered in Rocky Mountain National Park in the Big Thompson River, a tributary of the South Platte. Additional populations were found in 1965 and 1970, making possible the listing of the subspecies as endangered under the 1973 Endangered Species Act. Recovery efforts for the greenback cutthroat by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, assisted by Trout Unlimited, are ongoing and seemed to have made it possible to upgrade its status to threatened. However, it was recently determined that due to insufficient study of the original stock most if not all animals in the reintroduction program were actually the similar Colorado River cutthroat trout. Catch and release fishing of the greenback cutthroat is currently permitted in parts of both the South Platte and Arkansas River basins. The Bozeman National Fish Hatchery was a key player in the recovery of the greenback cutthroat trout. In 2012, a genetic study that compared DNA samples both from modern populations and historical samples dating back to the 19th century revealed that the only remaining population of pure greenback cutthroat trout is found in a stretch of Bear Creek, a tributary of the Arkansas River. Many of the populations previously identified as greenback cutthroat were actually of the similar Colorado River and Rio Grande cutthroat subspecies. The study also cleared up the confusion Hammond's labeling had created. His samples were tested and found to have been Rio Grandes rather than greenbacks, likely collected in New Mexico. All the sample crates he shipped had been labeled as being from Fort Riley, where his unit was based, and the South Platte regardless of where the samples within actually originated. ==See also== *Ecology of the Rocky Mountains *Yellowfin cutthroat trout ==NotesFurther reading== * * * ==External links== *\\"Efforts To Save Greenback Cutthroat Trout Snagged: Wrong Fish Restocked For Decades\\", Science Daily, September 5, 2007 * Greenback cutthroat trout Category:Freshwater fish of the United States Category:Fish of the Western United States Category:Fauna of the Northwestern United States Greenback cutthroat trout Greenback cutthroat trout Category:Endangered fauna of the United States Category:ESA threatened species ","title":"Greenback cutthroat trout"},{"id":"5603806","text":"Benjamin \\"Ben\\" McKinley (born 4 March 1987) is an Australian rules footballer who previously played for the North Melbourne Football Club in the Australian Football League (AFL).

Spangher played his first game for 2014 in round 3 against Fremantle, before suffering a major ankle injury in round 4 against Gold Coast.http://www.afl.com.au/news/2014-04-15/blow-for-saints-hawks He returned against his old club West Coast in round 12, being one of Hawthon's best players, with 22 disposals including 7 contested marks.http://www.afl.com.au/match-centre/2014/12/haw-v-wce Spangher again put in a strong performance the next week against Carlton, and continued his form against Collingwood. In the 2014 Grand Final, after witnessing premierships at West Coast in 2006, Sydney in 2012, and being an emergency in the Hawks 2013 win, Spangher was finally picked in his first Grand Final, and won his first premiership. During the medal ceremony, MC Craig Willis made reference to his incredible journey. At the conclusion of the 2016 season, he was delisted by Hawthorn. ==Cult hero== Spangher's move to the Hawks has been greeted with \\"cult hero\\" status. In mid 2013, a Facebook fan page titled \\"Sir Matthew Spangher\\" was created, that as of September 2015 has over 14,000 followers. Spangher's popularity amongst players and fans was shown with overwhelming applause and chants whenever he went near the ball during the VFL Grand Final for Box Hill. \\"It's interesting isn't it. It's nice, but I don't think it's deserved,\\" he said of the attention. With Spangher's appearances in the 2014 season, members of the media began to draw more attention to the fans growing affection, with members of the media also happy to play into the image. Herald Sun journalist Jon Ralph wrote \\"Let‚Äôs face it, when you look half rock god and half Jesus, men want to be you and women want to be with you.\\" Spangher has gained the nickname \\"Fabio\\" from 3AW due to his long hair. After finally claiming his first premiership in 2014, Hawthorn fans chanted his name, and demanded he speak to the fans at the premiership party, before fan favourite Cyril Rioli. ==Statistics== : - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" center\\"  2006   30  0  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî - ! scope=\\"row\\" center\\"  2007   30  0  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" center\\"  2008   30  7  1  2  39  22  61  24  8  0.1  0.3  5.6  3.1  8.7  3.4  1.1 - ! scope=\\"row\\" center\\"  2009   30  11  2  1  74  79  153  41  25  0.2  0.1  6.7  7.2  13.9  3.7  2.3 - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" center\\"  2010   30  8  0  1  67  36  103  27  19  0.0  0.1  8.4  4.5  12.9  3.4  2.4 - ! scope=\\"row\\" center\\"  2011   27  6  8  6  46  15  61  22  13  1.3  1.0  7.7  2.5  10.2  3.7  2.2 - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" center\\"  2012   27  0  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text- align:center\\"  2013   27  4  2  4  32  22  54  19  9  0.5  1.0  8.0  5.5  13.5  4.8  2.3 - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" center\\"  2014   27  15  0  2  132  76  208  72  33  0.0  0.1  8.8  5.1  13.9  4.8  2.2 - ! scope=\\"row\\" center\\"  2015   27  4  0  0  30  15  45  23  2  0.0  0.0  7.5  3.8  11.3  5.8  0.5 - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" center\\"  2016   27  1  0  0  1  0  1  0  0  0.0  0.0  1.0  0.0  1.0  0.0  0.0 - class=\\"sortbottom\\" ! colspan=3 Career ! 56 ! 13 ! 16 ! 421 ! 265 ! 686 ! 228 ! 109 ! 0.2 ! 0.3 ! 7.5 ! 4.7 ! 12.3 ! 4.1 ! 2.0 } ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:1987 births Category:Living people Category:Australian rules footballers from Victoria (Australia) Category:East Fremantle Football Club players Category:West Coast Eagles players Category:Sydney Swans players Category:Hawthorn Football Club players Category:Box Hill Football Club players Category:People educated at Xavier College ","title":"Matt Spangher"},{"id":"5603842","text":"From Soup to Nuts is a silent short subject directed by E. Livingston Kennedy starring comedy duo Laurel and Hardy. It was released on March 24, 1928, by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. ==Plot== Stan and Ollie are hired as waiters at an upper class dinner party, with Ollie taking charge before entering the property . The maid shows them inside, where Stan puts their personal card on table with a collection of others. Visible on their card is the slogan, ‚ÄúAll we ask is a chance‚Äù. A small fight breaks out between Ollie and Stan as a result of Ollie trying to keep Stan from putting his hat on inside the house. After the wife of the household inspects them she gets shown a notice apologizing that the only available waiters were the duo, where it is revealed on the paper that their previous experience in waiting was at railroad eating houses. Ollie comments to the wife's husband that she is ‚Äúsome wiggler!‚Äù and naturally, the husband is not impressed. The pair get ready to start work in the kitchen where Stan tells the chef (who is busy cooking) not to wear his hat. Stan takes it off him several times but the chef proceeds to keep putting it back on. Stan soon loses his cool and throws the chef's hat away. The chef retaliates by grabbing the nearest plate and smashing it over Stan's head. Stan does the same back to the chef and they carry on using plates as weapons until Ollie calms things down by stopping Stan from destroying a large, expensive looking plate. However, as Ollie walks off, he trips on the kitchen floor and smashes the plate, causing him to be embarrassed by the onlooking maid. Meanwhile, the party goes on, oblivious to the impending disaster awaiting them. The wife of the household isn't having an easy time either, as she struggles to eat her fruit cocktail with the cutlery provided. Her predicament carries on throughout the film. Stan and Ollie come into the room as they are about to start serving food. Stan manages to pour, what looks like soup, onto Ollie's foot while he counts the guests. Ollie begins carrying a very large cake to the table but slips on a banana skin left by the family dog and lands head first into the cake. Ollie manages to do this more than once in the film, much to the bemusement of the guests, and of Stan, who accuses him of falling over on purpose at one point. The pair spend most of the film falling down while trying to serve the food, much to the anger of the husband of the household. This is one of the first films to show Stan getting cross for once, as he loses his temper with Ollie's incompetence and with the guests. The wife then asks Ollie to serve the salad ‚Äúundressed‚Äù. Ollie tells Stan to do this who, confused, heads to the kitchen to tell the maid what he has to do. The maid says, ‚ÄúI always serve it that way...‚Äù. Stan can't believe this but goes ahead and dresses down to his underwear to serve the salad. The film ends with the husband and wife discovering Stan undressed, and after a futile attempt by Ollie to put a jacket on Stan and ask, ‚ÄúHow's that - perfect?‚Äù, Ollie gets hit by the wife and falls into yet another cake. ==CastProduction notes== From Soup to Nuts was remade as the first 20 minutes of Laurel & Hardy's 1940 feature film A Chump at Oxford. ==References External links == * * * Category:1928 films Category:1928 comedy films Category:American silent short films Category:American black-and- white films Category:Laurel and Hardy (film series) Category:Metro-Goldwyn- Mayer short films Category:Films with screenplays by H.

It has been speculated that some of these verses might be references to domesticated elephants.RV 4.4.1, 9.57.3 (where \\"the people deck him like a docile king of elephants\\"), 6.20.8; Talageri, Shrikant (2000) In RV 1.64.7, 8.33.8 and 10.40.4, \\"wild\\" elephants are mentioned.

Other scholars like Pischel and Karl Friedrich Geldner translate the term as elephant.Vedic Index, I, 79 According to Sayana, Mahidhara and the Nirukta, ibha is translated as elephant. Megasthenes and Nearchos also connect ibha with elephant. The term ibha is only used in the Samhitas, and especially in the Rig Veda.Vedic Index, I, 79.RV 1.84.17; 4.4.1; 9.57.3; and perhaps 6.20.8.

She was the second empress of Emperor Xiaowen. Feng Run was a daughter of Feng Xi (È¶ÆÁÜô) the Prince of Changli, who was a brother of the powerful Grand Empress Dowager Feng, the wife of Emperor Wencheng and regent over his son Emperor Xianwen and grandson Emperor Xiaowen. (Through her father, she was therefore also a great-granddaughter of the Northern Yan emperor Feng Hong.) Her mother was Feng Xi's concubine Lady Chang. When she was 13, Grand Empress Dowager Feng selected her and a sister of hers to be Emperor Xiaowen's concubines. Both were favored by Emperor Xiaowen, but her sister soon died of an illness, and she herself grew ill (may be of smallpox) and was sent back to her home. She subsequently became a Buddhist nun, but was said to have been sexually immoral during this timespan as well. In 493, Feng Run's younger sister by a different mother (probably Feng Xi's wife Princess Boling), Feng Qing, became Emperor Xiaowen's empress. Subsequently, Emperor Xiaowen, perhaps through Feng Qing, found out that Feng Run had recovered from her illness, and took her back into the palace as an imperial consort, with the title Zhaoyi (Êò≠ÂÑÄ). She became Emperor Xiaowen's favorite again. Because Feng Run was Emperor Xiaowen's concubine earlier and was an older sister, she refused to submit to Feng Qing and tried to undermine Feng Qing's position as an empress, including accusing Feng Qing of disobeying Emperor Xiaowen's Sinicization regime. In 496, Emperor Xiaowen deposed Feng Qing, and in 497, he created Feng Run empress. Because Emperor Xiaowen often spent his time on the frontlines battling rival Southern Qi, he was not often at the palace in the capital Luoyang. Empress Feng therefore carried on an affair with her attendant Gao Pusa (È´òËè©Ëñ©). With the eunuch Shuang Meng (ÈõôËíô) protecting her, few knew or dared to say anything about the affair, and when her attendant Ju Peng (ÂäáÂΩ≠) tried to counsel her to stop the affair, she would not, and Ju died in fear and anger. At the same time, however, Empress Feng tried to force Emperor Xiaowen's sister Princess Pengcheng (who had been widowed after the death of her husband Liu Chengxu (ÂäâÊâøÁ∑í), to marry her brother Feng Su (È¶ÆÂ§ô). Emperor Xiaowen approved of the marriage, Princess Pengcheng was unwilling to marry Feng Su, so she fled out of Luoyang and sought out Emperor Xiaowen on the frontline, revealing to him Empress Feng's affair with Gao. Emperor Xiaowen was initially unwilling to believe the accusation and kept it secret, but Empress Feng became nervous and, along with her mother Lady Chang, engaged witches to try to curse Emperor Xiaowen, who was already ill by this time, to death. However, Emperor Xiaowen did not die, and after he returned to Luoyang in 499, he interrogated Gao and Shuang, and both admitted. He then summoned Empress Feng and confronted her with Gao and Shuang's testimony‚Äîat an interrogation that no one else other than himself was at. After he finished the interrogation, he then summoned his brothers Yuan Xie the Prince of Pengcheng and Yuan Xiang (ÂÖÉË©≥) the Prince of Beihai, stating to them, \\"She used to be your sister-in-law, but treat her now as a passerby, and you need not avoid her.\\" (By traditional Chinese custom, a brother-in-law and a sister-in-law may not sit together or speak with each other.) Emperor Xiaowen then stated, \\"This woman wanted to stick a knife in my ribs. Because she is a daughter of Empress Dowager Wenming's clan, I cannot depose her, but I hope that one day she will find her conscience and kill herself. Do not believe that I have any remaining feelings for her.\\" After the two princes exited, Emperor Xiaowen gave her a final goodbye, indicating that he would not see her again. The concubines still greeted her as empress, but Emperor Xiaowen ordered his crown prince Yuan Ke not to see her again as well. When Emperor Xiaowen sent eunuchs to give her instructions on certain matters, she rebuked the eunuchs, stating that she was an empress and would not take instructions from eunuchs. In anger, Emperor Xiaowen sent a cane to her mother Lady Chang, and Lady Chang was forced to cane Empress Feng herself as punishment. Later that year, Emperor Xiaowen grew seriously ill, and he left instructions to Yuan Xie to force Empress Feng to commit suicide after his own death, but to bury her with imperial honors still to avoid shame to the Feng clan. He then died, and Yuan Xie sent the palace official Bai Zheng (ÁôΩÊï¥) to give her poison. Empress Feng refused to drink the poison, stating, \\"My husband did not make such an order! It is the princess who wants to kill me.\\" Bai seized her physically and forced poisonous peppers into her mouth, and she died. She was buried with imperial honors with her husband. == References == * Book of Wei, vol. 13. * History of Northern Dynasties, vol. 13. * Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 140, 141, 142 Category:Northern Wei empresses Category:499 deaths Category:Northern Wei Buddhists Category:Chinese Buddhist nuns Category:5th-century Buddhist nuns Category:Year of birth unknown ","title":"Feng Run"},{"id":"5603857","text":"Justine Fox-Young (born 1979) was a Republican member of the New Mexico House of Representatives, serving District 30.

After the 2008 primary election, in which she ran uncontested, Fox-Young claimed to have proof of voter fraud in the Democrat primary races. Soon after, voters whose registrations Fox-Young claimed were fraudulent began to challenge her allegations.

Retrieved 14 July 2012. ==Football career== Brett was drafted pick 9 in the 2003 rookie draft after impressing as a medium height defender for Claremont in the WAFL. In 2004, he was temporarily promoted from the rookie list after a long-term injury to a teammate. He played 8 games that season, including an impressive debut, gathering 19 disposals and 7 marks, in the round 7 loss to Melbourne. At the end of 2004, leading into the 2005 pre-season, he was permanently elevated of the rookie list, and went on to play 22 games in the 2005 season, missing the round 22 game against Adelaide, as well as the preliminary final against Adelaide and the losing grand final against Sydney. In 2006, he started off the season slowly playing on 4 of the first 14 games and spending extended stints playing for Claremont in the WAFL. He later ended up regaining his place in the team and from round 15 onwards he played the rest of the home and away season, missing only the round 19 clash against North Melbourne. For the 2006 qualifying final against Sydney he was initially dropped but ended up playing as a late inclusion (due to injuries to some of his teammates) and managed to hold his spot for the following finals games, including the memorable grand final victory over Sydney, which West Coast won by one point. Continuing from his efforts in the successful 2006 final series, he had a breakout season in 2007, in which he cemented his spot in the team playing all 24 games for the club. He played his 50th AFL game in the round 5 victory over Richmond. On Monday 26 September 2011, 1 day after playing in a WAFL grand final victory for Claremont, Jones retired from football at the AFL level following a meeting with West Coast head coach John Worsfold. ==Statistics== :Brett Jones' player profile at AFL Tables - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" center\\"  2004 style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  38  8  0  1  53  32  85  20  15  0.0  0.1  6.6  4.0  10.6  2.5  1.9 - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text- align:center\\"  2005 center;\\"  38  22  3  4  140  119  259  96  32  0.1  0.2  6.4  5.4  11.8  4.4  1.5 - eaeaea;\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" center\\"  2006 center;\\"  38  15  0  2  97  104  201  56  21  0.0  0.1  6.5  6.9  13.4  3.7  1.4 - ! scope=\\"row\\" center\\"  2007 center;\\"  38  24  1  1  233  222  455  115  43  0.0  0.0  9.7  9.3  19.0  4.8  1.8 - eaeaea;\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text- align:center\\"  2008 center;\\"  38  14  0  1  147  100  247  89  24  0.0  0.1  10.5  7.1  17.6  6.4  1.7 - ! scope=\\"row\\" center\\"  2009 center;\\"  38  9  2  0  57  51  108  32  13  0.2  0.0  6.3  5.7  12.0  3.6  1.4 - eaeaea;\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" center\\"  2010 center;\\"  38  10  0  0  81  76  157  44  17  0.0  0.0  8.1  7.6  15.7  4.4  1.7 - class=\\"sortbottom\\" ! colspan=3 Career ! 102 ! 6 ! 9 ! 808 ! 704 ! 1512 ! 452 ! 165 ! 0.1 ! 0.1 ! 7.9 ! 6.9 ! 14.8 ! 4.4 ! 1.6 } == References External links == * * Category:1982 births Category:Australian rules footballers from Western Australia Category:Claremont Football Club players Category:Living people Category:People educated at Hale School Category:People from Perth, Western Australia Category:West Coast Eagles players ","title":"Brett Jones (footballer)"},{"id":"5603863","text":"The giant moa (Dinornis) is an extinct genus of birds belonging to the moa family. Like all moa, it was a member of the order Dinornithiformes. It was endemic to New Zealand. Two species of Dinornis are considered valid, Dinornis novaezealandiae of the North Island, and Dinornis robustus of the South. In addition, two further species (new lineage A and lineage B) have been suggested based on distinct DNA lineages. ==Description== D. robustus skeleton D. struthoides skeleton, now known to be a male Dinornis, not a distinct species Dinornis may have been the tallest bird that ever lived, with the females of the largest species standing tall,Wood, Gerald (1983) and one of the most massive, weighing Amadon, D. (1947) or Campbell Jr., K. & Marcus, L. (1992) in various estimates. Feather remains are reddish brown and hair-like, and apparently covered most of the body except the lower legs and most of the head (plus a small portion of the neck below the head). While no feathers have been found from moa chicks, it is likely that they were speckled or striped to camouflage them from Haast's Eagles. The feet were large and powerful, and could probably deliver a powerful kick if threatened. The birds had long, strong necks and broad sharp beaks that would have allowed them to eat vegetation from subalpine herbs through to tree branches. In relation to its body, the head was small, with a pointed, short, flat and somewhat curved beak. The North Island giant moa tended to be larger than the South Island giant moa. Sexual dimorphism It has been long suspected that several species of moa constituted males and females, respectively. This has been confirmed by analysis for sex-specific genetic markers of DNA extracted from bone material.Huynen, L. J.,et al. (2003) For example, prior to 2003 there were three species of Dinornis recognised: South Island giant moa (D. robustus ), North Island giant moa (D. novaezealandiae) and slender moa (D. struthioides). However, DNA showed that all D. struthioides were in fact males, and all D. robustus were females. Therefore, the three species of Dinornis were reclassified as two species, one each formerly occurring in New Zealand's North Island (D. novaezealandiae) and South Island (D. robustus ); robustus however, comprises three distinct genetic lineages and may eventually be classified as many species. Dinornis seems to have had the most pronounced sexual dimorphism of all moa, with females being up to twice as tall and three times as heavy as males. ==Taxonomy== The cladogram below follows a 2009 analysis by Bunce et al.: == Habitat == Dinornis were very adaptable and were present in a wide range of habitats from coastal to alpine. It is possible that individual moa would have moved from environment to environment with the changing seasons. == Reproduction == While it is impossible to know exactly how Dinornis reproduced and raised young, assumptions can be made from extant ratites. The larger females may have competed to mate with the most desirable males who themselves were likely to have been extremely territorial. Eggs may have been laid in communal nests in sand dunes, or by individual birds in sheltered environments such as hollow trees or by rocks. The female would have had little to do with the eggs once they had been laid while the male would have incubated the egg for up to three months before it hatched. Dinornis eggs were enormous, as large as a rugby ball, and around 80 times the volume of a chicken's egg. However, despite their size, Dinornis eggs were extremely thin, with D. novaezealandiae's eggshells being around 1.06 millimeters (0.04 inches) thick and D. robustus' eggshells being 1.4 millimeters (0.06 inches) thick. As such, Dinornis eggs have been estimated to be the 'most fragile of all avian eggs measured to date'. It is possible that such fragile eggs resulted in the male moa adapting to become smaller in size than the females to reduce the risk of crushing the eggs. However, it is possible that the male moa would curl themselves around the eggs rather than sitting on them directly. Given the size of the eggs, and the incubation period, as soon as giant moa chicks hatched they would have been able to see, run and feed themselves. ==Extinction== Prior to the arrival of humans, the giant moa had an ecologically stable population in New Zealand for at least 40,000 years. The giant moa, along with other moa genera, were wiped out by Polynesian settlers, who hunted it for food. All taxa in this genus were extinct by 1500 in New Zealand. It is generally accepted that the MƒÅori still hunted them at the beginning of the fifteenth century, although some models suggest extinction had already taken place by the middle of the 14th century. Although some birds became extinct due to farming, for which the forests were cut and burned down and the ground was turned into arable land, the giant moa had been extinct for 300 years prior to the arrival of European settlers. ==References== ;Specific citations: ;General references : : : : : : : : : ==External links== * South Island Giant Moa.

It is produced by the independent non-profit organization, Jewish Education in Media (JEM). == Background == L'Chayim premiered on WMCA Radio in New York City on February 2, 1979. Produced and hosted by JEM's executive director, Rabbi Mark S. Golub, L'Chayim features issues, people and events of importance to Jews. L'Chayim was one of the first Jewish programs to adopt a contemporary talk format and has always featured guests from a variety of Jewish movements, reflecting JEM's pluralistic approach to modern Jewish life. In the early 1980s, L'Chayim was sponsored in Jewish communities by local Jewish federations. L'Chayim moved from WMCA to WOR Radio in New York City in the mid-1980s. In 1990, L'Chayim premiered on television where it continues to air. L'Chayim is part of the Jewish Broadcasting Service and can be seen at JBSTV.ORG.

It is all but merged with the nearby suburbs of Cwmynyscoy and Upper Race. It is a community of Torfaen, and includes the electoral wards of Brynwern, Cwmynyscoy, and Pontypool of Torfaen County Borough Council. Pontymoile is directly south of Pontypool and is bordered by Griffithstown to the south and New Inn to the east. It lies within the historic county of Monmouthshire and the preserved county of Gwent. It contains a mixture of traditional Welsh terraced houses, early Edwardian townhouses and modern 1960s flats and local authority housing. Pontymoile is spread across a large area and so is home to much of Pontypool's facilities including West Monmouth School, Coleg Gwent's Pontypool campus, the Pontymoile Basin on the Monmouthshire & Brecon Canal as well as St. Matthew's Anglican Church and the nondenominational Pontymoile Christian Mission on Rockhill Road. Pontymoile has its own primary school as well as a small selection of shops and public houses. ==Pontymoile Gates== The Pontymoile entrance to Pontypool Park was the original entrance leading to the house owned by the Hanbury Family. Pontymoile Gates (Welsh: Giatiau Pont-y-moel) are Grade II*, Cadw-listed fine metal gates that are known locally as the Sally gates. Sally was the nickname for the Duchess of Marlborough who presented them to the Hanbury family in thanks for their assistance in the execution of her late husband's will. Pontymoile Gates Renovated Park Gates Research has determined that the columns and gates date from around the mid-19th century, but were later added to (the addition of dog bars) to allow larger carriages and motorized traffic to enter the park. A report taken from the Pontypool Free Press in 1933 states that the gate's specifications were designed by T. E. Deakin in July 1835. Of particular interest are the vines on the pillars and bunches of grapes that would originally have been gilded, as were some acanthus leaves and finials on the gates. It is thought the original colour of the gates may have been green, maroon or a blue colour popular at the time. == Redevelopment == Two distinct phases of road building have affected the Pontymoile area. During the early 1980s an extension to A472 was built (diverting traffic away from Griffithstown and New Inn). This ended opposite the Pontymoile Mission and the area quickly became a traffic bottle-neck as the dual-carriageway A472 filtered into a one way system. Further redevelopment took place in the late 1990s to eradicate this bottle-neck when a new flyover on the A472 road was constructed to allow traffic to easily pass either into or by Pontypool town centre. This resulted in many buildings being demolished (including the original Pontymoile Mission, the railway viaduct and closure of the Prince of Wales public house). The development also resulted in a new road system to West Monmouth School and Coleg Gwent's Pontypool campus. == References External links== *www.geograph.co.uk : photos of Pontymoile and surrounding area Category:Suburbs of Pontypool Category:Communities in Torfaen Category:Electoral wards of Torfaen ","title":"Pontymoile"},{"id":"5603876","text":"French passport () is an identity document issued to French citizens.

Tribuson received his B.A. in literature from the Philosophical Faculty in Zagreb and his M.A. in filmology at the University of Zagreb. He worked for the Vjesnik Marketing Agency, and was a coeditor and revisor of the Croatian Lexicon. He teaches screen-writing at the Zagreb Academy of Dramatic Arts. Along with Pavao Pavliƒçiƒá, Tribuson is the most productive and the most popular Croatian writer from the mid-1970s to the present day. From the point of view of style, genre and subject matter Tribuson's work can be divided in several phases which all have in common the author's concern for the reader for whom he is writing, a compact plot, a great writing skill and the avoidance of any ideology. Tribuson is equally skilled in the application of postmodernist techniques: persiflage, quotes, intertextuality, autoreference, metatextuality etc. His writing is influenced by rock and pop-culture, film and sometimes even jazz. His literary models are Raymond Chandler, Graham Greene and Karel ƒåapek. He lives in Zagreb. == Work == Tribuson began writing and publishing short-stories in various magazines while he was still at college. As a subversive reaction to the superimposed social realism in Croatian literature a generation of fantastical writers emerged in the early 1970s, and Tribuson was part of it. He is still considered to be one of the most prominent representatives of this movement. His early fantastical stories were published in three collections, Zavjera kartografa (The Cartographists Conspiracy, 1972), Pra≈°ka smrt (Death in Prague, 1975) i Raj za pse (Dog Heaven, 1978). Mysticism, the occult and horror are some of the themes of these stories. Thematically, the novel Snijeg u Heidelbergu (Snow in Heidelberg, 1980) belongs to the same fantastical cycle, although it also marks the beginning of a new phase. Critics consider it one of the best works of the fantastical writers' generation. It is a kind of mixture of the sotonic and the picaresque. Tribuson returns to the fantastical and the grotesque in several other works: in his novel Potonulo groblje (Sunken Cemetery, 1990), which is considered to be a contemporary version of the gothic novel and which got him the \\"K. ≈†. Gjalski\\" literary award; in the novel entitled Sanatorij (Sanatorium, 1993), as well as in the collection of short-stories entitled Zvijezda kabarea (Star of the Cabaret, 1999), in which he emerges as a fully mature writer of the so-called fantastical prose. The 1980s mark the beginning of Tribuson's so-called Aschenreiterov cycle which, in addition to the already mentioned ones, includes the novels ƒåuje≈° li nas Frido ≈†tern (Do You Hear Us, Frida ≈†tern, 1981) and Ruski rulet (Russian Roulette, 1982) subtitled \\"a boulevard novel\\", and erases the boundaries between the so-called \\"highbrow\\" and \\"lowbrow\\" literature. The third cycle comprises Tribuson‚Äôs autobiographical writings, the best known among them being a trilogy of \\"generation\\" novels: Polagana predaja (Slow Surrender, 1984), Legija stranaca (Foreign Legion, 1985) and several editions of the bestselling Povijest pornografije (History of Pornography, 1988), which deals with the theme of growing up in a small town, the emergence and disappearance of youthful illusions and ideals, the confrontation of socialism with the unstoppable breakthrough of rock, pop culture, film and media. This cycle of varying quality includes, among other things, autobiographical prose works such as Rani dani (Early Days, 1997), Trava i korov (Grass and Weed, 1999) and Mrtva priroda (Still Nature, 2003). These are witty, ironic, clever and often fragmentary writings about the author's family history which is intertwined with history in general. Thematically the cycle includes the humorous novel Ne dao Bog veƒáeg zla (God Save Us From Greater Evil, 2002), written after the production of the film with the same title, for which Tribuson wrote the screenplay. His fourth cycle consists of \\"pure\\" crime novels in the manner of the American hard boiled school: in his interviews, Tribuson repeatedly asserted that \\"a crime novel can either be a stylistic exercise or a social novel; if it is just an exercise, I am not interested in it\\". Thus, in the six novels published so far (Zavirivanje/Peaking 1985; Siva zona /The Grey Zone 1989; Dublja strana zaljeva /The Deeper End of the Bay 1991; Noƒána smjena /Night Shift 1996; Bijesne lisice /Rabid Foxes 2000; Gorka ƒçokolada /Bitter Chocolate 2004), structured as detective stories featuring P.I. Nikola Baniƒá he has given a historical panorama of the Croatian society, from the beginning of the fall of socialism to the ups and downs of the transitional period. Tribuson has not only given literary legitimacy to the crime genre in Croatian literature, he also bases novels of this genre on the everyday reality of the local community. Although his private investigator Nikola Baniƒá, a Croatian version of Phil Marlow, is a slightly unconventional detective type because he is a jazz fan, a beer drinker, a dedicated smoker and a man burdened with many family problems, he has become very popular among the readers. Tribuson is the most popular Croatian writer of his generation. Critics sometimes consider him to be a populist writer, a writer who is too eager to please his audience with his genre novels. They therefore consider his fantastical novels to be his best. It is true, however, that Tribuson has produced works of anthological value in each of his cycles. == Books == *Zavjera kartografa, (The Cartographists Conspiracy, stories), Zagreb: Znanje, 1972 *Pra≈°ka smrt, groteske, (Death in Prague, grotesques), Zagreb: Centar za kulturnu djelatnost Saveza socijalistiƒçke omladine, 1975 *Raj za pse, (Dog Heaven, stories), ƒåakovec: \\"Zrinski\\", 1978 *Snijeg u Heidelbergu, (Snow in Heidelberg, novel), Zagreb: \\"August Cesarec\\", 1980 *ƒåuje≈° li nas Frido ≈†tern, (Do You Hear Us, Frida ≈†tern, novel), Zagreb: \\"August Cesarec\\", 1981 *Ruski rulet : bulevarski roman, 2 sv., (Russian Roulette: a boulevard novel) Beograd: Prosveta, 1982 *Spavaƒáa kola, izabrane priƒçe, (Sleeping Compartment, selected stories), Osijek: Revija, 1983 *Polagana predaja, (Slow Surrender, novel), Zagreb: Znanje, 1984 *Legija stranaca, (Foreign Legion, novel), Zagreb: Znanje, 1985 *Zavirivanje: [prvi sluƒçaj policijskog inspektora Baniƒáa], (Peaking: police inspector Baniƒá's first case), Beograd: Prosveta, 1985 *Uzvratni susret, (Counter game, novel) Opatija: \\"Otokar Ker≈°ovani\\", 1986 *Made in U.

Band which might have referred to either the remains of a Roman watchtower or a primitive refuge of the Early Middle Ages. ==Proto-Duchy (963‚Äì1353)== By the 959 partition of Lotharingia, the Luxembourg region had passed to Duke Frederick I of Upper Lorraine of the House of Ardenne-Bar, a son of Count Palatine Wigeric of Lotharingia. In 963, Count Siegfried, probably a younger brother of Duke Frederick I, purchased some land from Abbot Wikerus of Saint Maximin's in Trier. This land was centered on a ruined (supposedly Roman) fort by the Old High German name of Lucilinburhuc (commonly translated as \\"little castle\\"). In the following years, Count Siegfried had a new castle built on the site of these ruins, on a rock that would later be called Bock Fiels. This castle dominated a stretch of the old Roman road linking Reims, Arlon, and Trier, and opened some prospects for trade and taxation. Despite this new construction, it seems that Siegfried and his immediate successors did not make the castle their primary residence. The history of Luxembourg proper began with the construction of this castle. In the following years, a small town and market grew around the new castle. The first inhabitants were probably servants of Count Siegfried and clergy of Saint Michael's church. This settlement soon received additional protection by the construction of a first, partial city wall and moat. In addition to the small town near Bock Fiels and the Roman road, another settlement was formed in the Alzette Valley (today the Grund quarter). By 1083, this lower town contained two churches, two bridges of the rivers Alzette, and Petruss. Its inhabitants pursued various professions, including fishing, baking and milling. That same year, the Benedictine abbey of Altm√ºnster was founded by Count Conrad on the hill behind Luxembourg castle. Henry III was the first count known to have established his permanent residence in Luxembourg castle. In a document from the year 1089, he is referred to as comes Henricus de Lutzeleburg, which also makes him the first documented count of Luxembourg. Around this fort, the town gradually developed and became the center of a small, but important state of great strategic value to France, Germany, and the Low Countries. Luxembourg's fortress was steadily enlarged and strengthened over the years by successive owners, making the Fortress of Luxembourg one of the strongest in continental Europe. Its formidable defenses and strategic location caused it to become known as the Gibraltar of the North. The House of Luxembourg provided several Holy Roman Emperors, kings of Bohemia, and archbishops of Trier and Mainz. From the Early Middle Ages to the Renaissance, Luxembourg bore multiple names, including Lucilinburhuc, Lutzburg, L√ºtzelburg, Luccelemburc, and Lichtburg, among others. ==The Duchy (1353‚Äì1797)== Luxembourg remained an independent fief (county) of the Holy Roman Empire, when, in 1354, Emperor Charles IV elevated it to the status of a duchy for his brother Wenceslaus. The ducal lands had been formed in 1353 by integration of the old County of Luxembourg, the marquisat of Arlon, the counties of Durbuy and Laroche, and the districts of Thionville, Bitburg, and Marville. The county of Vianden can also be included as it had been a vassal of the counts and dukes of Luxembourg since about 31 July 1264. In 1411, Sigismund of Luxembourg lost the duchy to his niece Elisabeth because he defaulted on a loan. Elizabeth later sold the duchy to the Duke of Burgundy, Philip the Good of the House of Valois-Burgundy, who paid her off in 1444. The dukes of Burgundy had previously acquired a number of other possessions in the Low Countries, including Flanders, Artois, Hainaut, Brabant, Zeeland, Holland, and Namur; Luxembourg and these other Burgundian possessions in the Low Countries are collectively referred to during this period (1384‚Äì1482) as the Burgundian Netherlands. The male line of the dukes of Burgundy died out in 1477 when Philip's son Charles the Bold died at the Battle of Nancy, leaving Mary of Burgundy, his only child, as his heiress. After his death, Mary married Archduke Maximilian I of the House of Habsburg, who later became Holy Roman Emperor. The Burgundian Netherlands then came under the rule of the House of Habsburg, beginning the period of the Habsburg Netherlands (1482‚Äì1581). With the abdication in 1555 of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V (also King of Spain Charles I), the Habsburg Netherlands passed to his son King Philip II of Spain. During the Dutch Revolt, or Eighty Years War, the seven northern provinces of the Habsburg Netherlands broke away from Spain to form the Dutch Republic in 1581, while the remaining ten southern provinces (including Luxembourg) remained under Spanish rule until 1714. During this time, the remaining southern provinces were referred to as the Spanish Netherlands (or Southern Netherlands, a name that continued under Austrian rule). The War of the Spanish Succession, which was fought after the Spanish Habsburg line died out in 1700, resulted in the Spanish Netherlands coming under the rule of the Habsburg Monarchy of Austria in 1714, thereby beginning the period of the Austrian Netherlands. The area remained under Austrian rule until the French Revolution, when it was taken over by France in 1795. Austria confirmed its loss in the 1797 Treaty of Campo Formio. ==Post- Duchy (1797‚Äìpresent)== three partitions greatly reduced the country's territory over the years. For√™ts was a d√©partement of the French First Republic, and later the First French Empire in present Belgium, Luxembourg, and Germany. Its name, meaning \\"forests,\\" comes from the Ardennes forests. It was formed on 24 October 1795,Kreins (2003), pp.64‚Äì5 after the Southern Netherlands had been annexed by France on 1 October.Kreins (2003), p.64 Before the occupation of the French, the territory was part of the Duchy of Luxemburg and the Duchy of Bouillon. Luxembourg lost a small amount of its territory to Prussia in 1813. Its capital was Luxembourg City. After Napoleon was defeated in 1814, most of it became part of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, with the part on the east side of the rivers Our and Sauer becoming part of Prussia (now Germany). At the Congress of Vienna in 1815 some of the land of the former Duchy of Luxemburg was given to Prussia to satisfy a dynastic claim and the remainder was created as a new Grand Duchy of Luxemburg which also became a member of the German Confederation and given to King William I of the Netherlands in a personal union with the United Kingdom of the Netherlands. Unlike the Netherlands, however, Luxembourg was part of the German Confederation established in 1815, and a garrison of the Kingdom of Prussia was stationed there. After the Kingdom of Belgium gained its independence from the Netherlands in 1830, Luxembourg was partitioned in 1839, with the larger western portion of the grand duchy going to Belgium, so that the grand duchy comprised only the smaller eastern portion. The personal union between Luxembourg's throne and the Dutch throne continued until the death of William III in 1890, at which time the Dutch throne passed to his daughter Wilhelmina and the Luxembourg throne passed to Adolph of Nassau-Weilburg. The territory of the former Duchy of Luxembourg is now divided between the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the Belgian province of Luxembourg, the German Land of Rhineland- Palatinate and the French departments of Ardennes, Meuse and Moselle, the latter part being referred to as since the 1659 Treaty of the Pyrenees. ==NotesReferences== * Ermesinde et l'affranchissement de la ville de Luxembourg; Etudes sur la femme, le pouvoir et la ville au XIIIe si√®cle, sous la direction de Michel Margue, Publications du Mus√©e d'Histoire de la Ville de Luxembourg, Publications du CLUDEM tome 7, Luxembourg 1994. * Tatsachen aus der Geschichte des Luxemburger Landes, Dr. P.

The Simpsons is an American animated television sitcom created by Matt Groening for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The series is a satirical parody of a middle class American lifestyle epitomized by its eponymous family, which consists of Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie. It is set in the fictional town of Springfield, and lampoons American culture, society and television, and many aspects of the human condition. The family was conceived by Groening shortly before a pitch for a series of animated shorts with producer James L. Brooks. Groening created a dysfunctional family and named the characters after members of his own family, substituting Bart for his own name. The shorts became a part of The Tracey Ullman Show on April 19, 1987 and after a three- season run, the sketch was developed into a half-hour prime time show and became a hit series for Fox.. The growing popularity of the series motivated video game developers to create video games based on the series. Two pinball machines have also been produced; one self-titled, that was only made available for a limited time after the first season finale (1990) and The Simpsons Pinball Party (2003). Additionally, several handheld device games have been released, such as Bartman: Avenger of Evil (1990) and Bart Simpson's Cupcake Crisis (1991). Video games based on the series have reached multiple platforms since their debut in 1991. The Simpsons' first video game release, The Simpsons, developed and published by Konami, saw a release on the Commodore 64 and DOS, while Bart vs. the Space Mutants (1991), developed by Imagineering, expanded the franchise into new platforms, including the Amstrad CPC, NES and Master System. Over the next few years, the franchise would continue to expand, releasing system-exclusive games, such as the PC's Cartoon Studio (1996) and the PlayStation's The Simpsons Wrestling (2001). The release of The Simpsons Game (2007), developed by EA Redwood Shores (Visceral Games), further expanded the franchise, appearing on new platforms including the Wii, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. Due to the series' longevity, The Simpsons video games have also spanned across many genres, such as the puzzle game Krusty's Fun House (1992), the sports game Itchy & Scratchy in Miniature Golf Madness (1994) and racing game Road Rage (2001). The Simpsons is also one of the franchises spotlighted in the toys-to-life video game Lego Dimensions (2015). ==Video games== , 27video games focused on The Simpsons series have been released.

Tolkien's The Hobbit, which he, aged 10, recommended to his father, the publisher Sir Stanley Unwin Rayner Stephens Unwin CBE (23 December 1925 ‚Äì 23 November 2000) was an English publisher, who served as the chairman of the publishing firm George Allen & Unwin, which had been founded by his father Sir Stanley Unwin. ==Early life== Unwin was born in 1925 in Hampstead, London, one of four children from the marriage of publisher Stanley Unwin and Mary n√©e Storr (1883‚Äì1971). His father was the founder of the publishing house George Allen & Unwin. As a young boy, Unwin served as a test reader for the firm, as his father believed that children were the best judges of what made good children's books. He was paid one shilling for each written report, which as Unwin later remarked was \\"good money in those days\\". Most notable among the reviews he wrote for his father was his 1936 report, aged 10, for the J.R.R. Tolkien book The Hobbit. \\"Not a very good piece of literary criticism,\\" Rayner Unwin later said of the report, \\"but in those happy days, no second opinion was needed; if I said it was good enough to publish, it was published.\\" After attending Abbotsholme School in Rocester between the ages of 10 and 17, Unwin started working as a book salesman for Basil Blackwell, whose father was the founder of Blackwell's bookshop in Oxford. Between 1944 and 1947, he served in East Asia as a sub-lieutenant in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve. He then studied for an undergraduate degree at Trinity College, Oxford, before completing a master's degree in English at Harvard University, which he attended as a Fulbright scholar. ==Career== Allen and Unwin In 1951, Unwin began working for his father's firm George Allen & Unwin, with a starting salary of ¬£35 per week. George Allen & Unwin published The Hobbit in September 1937. Rayner Unwin entered publishing himself around 1951, and was offered the manuscript for The Lord of the Rings. He thought it ought to be published as well, and writing to his father with the figures, he said he thought they might lose a thousand pounds. Sir Stanley wrote back, saying \\"If you think this to be a work of genius, then you may lose a thousand pounds.\\" Unwin was also responsible for the first UK publication of the Roald Dahl children's books James and the Giant Peach and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Dahl had been struggling to find a publisher for these titles in the UK, but caught the attention of Unwin after Unwin's daughter Camilla became captivated by a copy of James and the Giant Peach that her schoolfriend Tessa Dahl (Roald's daughter) had given her.Sturrock, Storyteller, pp. 442‚Äì444. When Sir Stanley died in 1968, Unwin became the new chairman of the firm. His father had been preparing him for the role during his time at the firm; Rayner's older brother David had decided to pursue a career as a children's author instead. David Unwin later wrote in his memoirs: \\"I have always felt guilty at my defection, for by taking my place Rayner sacrificed his own promising career as an author\\". Initially, the firm enjoyed success under the chairmanship of Unwin. However, during the 1980s, the firm's comparatively small turnover of ¬£8 million became a cause for concern. In 1986, George Allen & Unwin was merged with Bell and Hyman to form Unwin Hyman, with Unwin acting as chairman. In 1989, the new firm faced serious difficulties when managing director Robin Hyman became seriously ill at a time when the company's profits were declining rapidly. The company was acquired by HarperCollins in 1990, a decision to which Unwin was opposed. Before the contract was signed, Unwin resigned as a protest, and he remarked to his friends: \\"I feel I've betrayed my father.\\" Writing career Unwin was also the writer or editor of several works, which were published in two periods. His first period of writing activity came during his first decade at Allen & Unwin. He was the editor of The Gulf of Years: Letters from John Ruskin to Kathleen Olander (1953). He produced a critical work on poetry entitled The Rural Muse (1954), which covered the work of poets such as John Clare, George Crabbe and Stephen Duck. This was followed by The Defeat of John Hawkins: A Biography of His Third Voyage (1960), a detailed account of the expedition made by 16th-century navigator John Hawkins to San Juan de Ul√∫a in Mexico. Initially published by George Allen & Unwin, it was later reissued by Pelican. ==Personal life== Unwin married Carol Margaret n√©e Curwen (1924‚Äì2012) on 3 April 1952. Carol's father Harold also worked in the publishing trade, as the owner of the Curwen Press. The two families had known each other for a long time, as Stanley Unwin and Harold Curwen had attended Abbotsholme School together. Carol Curwen was working as a nurse at the time of their marriage. Their first married home was a flat above the Museum Street offices of Allen & Unwin. They later moved to Limes Cottage, a Grade II listed property in the Buckinghamshire village of Little Missenden. They continued to live there until their deaths, in 2000 and 2012 respectively. Unwin served as chairman for the annual Little Missenden Music Festival between 1981 and 1988. The Unwins had four children: three daughters and one son. His son Merlin also entered the publishing trade, initially working for George Allen & Unwin before setting up his own independent publishing company, Merlin Unwin Books, with a focus on countryside and fishing. He was a member of the Garrick Club. Unwin died of cancer on 23 November 2000 at the Hospice of St Francis in Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire. His cremated remains were taken by his daughter to the Himalayas and scattered there. == The Unwin Charitable Trust == The Unwin Charitable Trust was established in 1975 by Rayner Unwin using a bequest from his father, Sir Stanley Unwin. It began by supporting the Book Trust and the Publishing Training Centre, relationships that continue to thrive, along with \\"many other good causes that benefit and promote publishing and the distribution of the printed word, schemes that encourage literacy and the enjoyment of reading\\". The Trustees are Adrian Stephenson, Frances Pra-Lopez, and Merlin Spedding Unwin, son of Rayner. With support of the Booksellers Association, the Trust has a free mentoring programme for small, independent booksellers; Sheila O‚ÄôReilly has the role of mentor. Georgina Miller is the Trust's contact person.

In November 2008, California voters passed Proposition 11, the Voters FIRST Act, which took political redistricting responsibility away from the state legislature and instead established a 14-member statewide redistricting commission composed of five Republicans, five Democrats, and four not affiliated with either of those two parties but registered with another party or as decline-to-state. The California Citizens Redistricting Commission was initially charged with updating the state assembly, senate, and Board of Equalization district boundaries starting with the 2010 census. Another initiative, Proposition 20, passed in 2010, expanded the Commission responsibilities to also include the state Congressional districts. ==Congressional districts== California is divided into 53 Congressional districts. Each district elects a representative to serve in the United States House of Representatives as part of the California's congressional delegation. California's current districts were drawn in 2011 by a California Citizens Redistricting Commission. The new boundaries took effect for the June 12, 2012 primary. ==State legislative districts== State Senate districts California is divided into 40 State Senate districts, each of which elects a senator to the State Senate. Twice the size of an Assembly district, each senate district contains about 931,000 people. The combined Senate roster is available from . The members of the California Senate Republican caucus are listed at . Prior to 1968, state senate districts were restricted such that one county could only hold at most one seat. This led to the situation of Los Angeles County, with 6 million residents as of 1968, receiving 600 times less representation than residents of Alpine County and Calaveras County, some of California's least populous counties. The Reynolds v. Sims decision by the United States Supreme Court compelled all states to draw up districts that were apportioned by population rather than geography. As such, boundaries were changed such that equal representation was provided.  State Assembly districts  California is divided into 80 State Assembly districts, each of which elects a member to the State Assembly. Each assembly district contains about 466,000 people. Each Assembly member is limited to three terms by a referendum passed by California voters. In March 2008, Proposition 93 unsuccessfully attempted to change term limits to a maximum of twelve years or six terms instead of three. The California Assembly Democratic Caucus members are listed at . The California Assembly Republican Caucus members are listed at . ==California Appellate Court districts== The California Court of Appeal is divided into six appellate districts, based on geography. Some of the appellate districts are further divided into Divisions.  First District  The California Court of Appeal for the First District is located in San Francisco. Its jurisdiction is over the following counties: Alameda, Contra Costa, Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Marin, Mendocino, Napa, San Francisco, San Mateo, Solano, and Sonoma. It is divided into five non-geographical divisions with four justices each.  Second District  The California Court of Appeal for the Second District has its main courthouse in Los Angeles and the secondary courthouse, hosting Division Six, in Ventura. Division Six handles appeals from San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, and Ventura Counties, while Divisions One through Five, Seven, and Eight handle appeals from Los Angeles County. Each division has four justices.  Third District  The California Court of Appeal for the Third District is located in Sacramento. Its jurisdiction is over the following counties: Alpine, Amador, Butte, Calaveras, Colusa, El Dorado, Glenn, Lassen, Modoc, Mono, Nevada, Placer, Plumas, Sacramento, San Joaquin, Shasta, Sierra, Siskiyou, Sutter, Tehama, Trinity, Yolo, and Yuba. It has 11 justices and is not divided into divisions.  Fourth District  The California Court of Appeal for the Fourth District is unique in that it is divided into three geographical divisions that are administratively separate, which even have different case number systems, and yet remain referred to as a single district.  Division One  The Division One courthouse is located in San Diego. It handles appeals from Imperial and San Diego Counties. It has 10 justices.  Division Two  The Division Two courthouse is located in Riverside. It handles appeals from Inyo, Riverside, and San Bernardino Counties. It has seven justices. It is the only California appellate court that issues a tentative opinion before oral argument.  Division Three  The Division Three courthouse is located in Santa Ana. It handles appeals from Orange County. It has eight justices.  Fifth District  The California Court of Appeal for the Fifth District is located in Fresno. Its jurisdiction covers the following counties: Fresno, Kern, Kings, Madera, Mariposa, Merced, Stanislaus, Tulare, and Tuolumne. It has nine justices.  Sixth District  The California Court of Appeal for the Sixth District is located in San Jose. Its jurisdiction covers San Benito, Santa Clara, Santa Cruz, and Monterey Counties. It has seven justices. ==Board of Equalization districts== California's Board of Equalization is a public agency charged with tax administration and fee collection. For the purposes of tax administration, the Board of Equalization divides the state into four Equalization Districts, each with its own elected board member.State Board of Equalization, 2003-2004 Annual Report, Profile, \\"Governance\\" p. 5.State Board of Equalization, Board Members  First District  The first Equalization District is made up of the following counties: Alameda, Colusa, Contra Costa, Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Marin, Mendocino, Monterey, Napa, San Benito, San Francisco, San Luis Obispo, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Santa Cruz, Solano, Sonoma, Trinity, Yolo, and a portion of Santa Barbara.

The larvae grow to in length, are reddish brown in colour and covered with bristles. The larval form feeds on natural fibres, damaging carpets, furniture and clothing. ==Life cycle== Attagenus unicolor undergoes complete metamorphosis, which has four life stages: Egg, larvae, pupae and adult. Each stage looks different, and needs different amounts of time to reach the next stage. Eggs are usually laid near or on a food source. If no food source can be found, the female will lay them in dark undisturbed locations where the larvae can feed on carpeting or clothing. They will also lay eggs on or near dog food or other pet food. Eggs take anywhere from 5 to 20 days to hatch depending on the conditions, such as temperature and humidity. Larvae are about in size when they hatch from the egg. They grow fairly quickly depending on the food source availability and protein found in the food itself. Larvae moult about 10 to 15 times, or more depending on conditions. Sometimes if food is scarce they will retro-moult with the larvae moulting into a lower instar. They can do this multiple times, if they are large enough. The larval stage is the longest and most destructive stage; they can remain as larvae for up to 3 years, although it does not typically take longer than 3 months to go through the larval stage if food and conditions are good. Larvae pupate in undisturbed locations, far away from the food source so that they aren't cannibalized. Pupae are cream white but quickly turn yellow and darken with age. They do not eat in this stage nor move. They transform into the beetles in about 8 to 20 days, depending on the conditions. The beetle may stay in the shedded pupae case for an additional day or two. Beetles start out white but darken with age. They typically do not eat, although they will sometimes eat flower pollen in the wild, but not indoors. Adults live for a few weeks, just long enough to mate and lay more eggs. They are eventually black in colour, hence the name Black Carpet Beetle. Females are capable of laying 50 to 100 eggs. The whole life cycle under ideal conditions takes about 4 to 5 months, or less if given protein-rich food, such as pet food. The adult females will lay more eggs if water is present in small amounts. ==See also== *Varied carpet beetle ==External links== *Black carpet beetle on the UF / IFAS Featured Creatures website * Black carpet beetle fact sheet, Penn State College of Agricultural Sciences Category:Dermestidae Category:Beetles described in 1791 ","title":"Black carpet beetle"},{"id":"5604088","text":"Sport Club Corinthians can refer to the following association football clubs: *Sport Club Corinthians Alagoano, from Macei√≥, Alagoas, Brazil *Sport Club Corinthians Paulista, from S√£o Paulo, S√£o Paulo state, Brazil *Sport Club Corinthians Paranaense, from S√£o Jos√© dos Pinhais, Paran√° state, Brazil ","title":"Sport Club Corinthians"},{"id":"5604105","text":"\\"Show Stopper\\" is the debut single by American girl group Danity Kane from their 2006 self-titled debut album.

Cornish Language Partnership. is a village in Cornwall, United Kingdom. It is three miles (5 km) south-southwest of NewquayOrdnance Survey: Landranger map sheet 200 Newquay & Bodmin and is in the civil parish of Cubert (). Once known as St Cubert, the village is dominated by the spire of its 14th-century church which was enlarged by the addition of a south aisle a century later. The village is named after the Welsh missionary St Cubert who, as a companion of St Carantoc, brought the Christian faith to this part of Cornwall, and to whom the church is dedicated. Unlike his companion St Carantoc‚Äîwho travelled on to Brittany‚ÄîSt Cubert returned to Wales becoming abbot of his monastery and, according to the Welsh chronicles, dying in 775. The feast of St Cubert is celebrated on the Sunday following 4 October.Cornish Church Guide (1925) Truro: Blackford; p. 14 Gilbert H. Doble included translations of the \\"Vita Carantoci\\" and extracts from the \\"L√©on Breviary\\" in his account of St Carantoc. After reviewing all the evidence he could find he concluded that Carantoc had been the leader of a band of Welsh missionaries who came to the Crantock district to evangelize it; Cubert was among his followers, and after their work in Cornwall was done they went on to Brittany where a district around L√©on has place-names and dedications related to these missionary saints.Doble, G. H. (1965) The Saints of Cornwall; Part four: Saints of the Newquay, Pastow and Bodmin district. Truro: Dean and Chapter; pp. 31-52 St Cubert's holy well is in a cave accessible only at low tide towards the north end of Holywell Bay.Ellis, P. B. (1992) The Cornish Saints. Penryn: Tor Mark Press, pp. 9-10 The hamlets of Tresean, Treveal, Trevemper, Treworgans and Ellenglaze are in the parish.Cornwall; Explore Britain ==History and antiquities== The village has been without its prefix 'St' since the 16th/17th century when it was abandoned at the same time as the churchwardens whitewashed over the figure of St Cubert dressed as an abbot on the inside wall of the church. On early maps it often appears as St Kibberd‚Äîpossibly indicating what the visiting cartographer heard when a local inhabitant was asked the name of the village. To the west of the village, halfway between the village and the coast, is the medieval holy well dedicated to St Cubert, from which the coastal bay takes its name. At the north end of the beach, only accessible two hours before and after low-tide, is a natural well in the rock that 19th century romanticists like to think was the origin of the name Holywell. A mile to the east of the village near the Newquay crossroads, where the four parishes of St Cubert, Crantock, St Newlyn East and Perranzabuloe meet, was the chapel of St Nectan (the foundations of which were uncovered when the road was widened and straightened in 1970), where on certain feasts during the year the relics of the Patron Saints of the four parishes were carried in procession for their veneration by the faithful. An inscribed stone, dated from the sixth to eighth centuries, was found imbedded in the walls of the fifteenth-century church. It bears the name of \\"Cenet[o]cus, son of Tege[r]nomalus\\".See the discussion and bibliography in Elisabeth Okasha, Corpus of Early Christian Inscribed Stones of South-west Britain (Leicester: University Press, 1993), pp. 97-99. A Cornish cross stands against the wall of the north transept of the church.

Singapore The Guards-of-Honour (GOH) from the three Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) branches (the Army, the Navy and the Air Force), together with their counterparts from the Singapore Police Force (SPF), performs the feu-de-joie as a standard element of the country's National Day celebrations on 9 August every year. This is carried out before the GOH marches past the president's reviewing-stand out from the parade. The tradition began in the 1980 edition as a way to celebrate the first 15 years since Singapore's independence, and became a regular tradition starting 1989. ==See also== * Celebratory gunfire ==ReferencesExternal links== Category:Military life Category:Military traditions ","title":"Feu de joie"},{"id":"5604181","text":"Gerrans () is a coastal civil parish and village on the Roseland Peninsula in Cornwall, England, United Kingdom.

However, in 1849 everything except the tower was rebuilt (by William White of Truro) though this was done as closely as possible to the original church. The two-stage tower is buttressed, battlemented, and topped by a spire. There is a fine Cornish cross in the churchyard.Langdon, A. G. (1896) Old Cornish Crosses. Truro: Joseph Pollard; pp. 263-64 According to Andrew Langdon (1994) this cross was not originally a churchyard cross but a wayside cross. No other ancient stone cross exists in the Roseland Peninsula; however a cross called Penpirthe Cross is shown on the parish terrier of 1613 as standing on the boundary of the parishes of Gerrans and Philleigh.Langdon, A.

He started the Kendall-Jackson wine business with the family's 1974 purchase of an pear and walnut orchard in Lakeport, California that was converted to a vineyard. The first release of Vintner's Reserve Chardonnay in 1982 closed the gap between the super premium and cheap wine market. As of 2010, Vintner's Reserve Chardonnay was one of the most popular wines on the market. His style as a vintner was focused upon single-vineyard, mountain grown wines. ==Early life and education== Jess Jackson grew up during the Great Depression and was raised in San Francisco's Sunset District.Fish, Tim, \\"Sonoma Vintner Jess Jackson Dies\\", Wine Spectator, 15 June 2011, p. 14. His father, a teacher, was out of work three times while he was growing up, and there were times when the family had to survive on rice. To help support his family, Jackson started working at an early age. From the age of five, when he got his first job as a paper boy, he worked a variety of jobs including candy maker, a soda jerk, a temp at the post office, a hops picker, a longshoreman, a teamster, a lifeguard, an ambulance driver, among other things. Jackson graduated from San Francisco's Abraham Lincoln High School. He earned a law degree from UC Berkeley School of Law at the University of California, Berkeley. While studying law he simultaneously held down jobs as a dock laborer, Berkeley policeman and an ambulance driver to put himself through school. Upon his graduation from Boalt in 1951, Jackson started practicing real estate law. ==Wine production== In the late 1950s, Jess Jackson started a law firm in the San Francisco area, specializing in property rights issues, that went on to argue cases in front of the Supreme Court. Jackson was one of the founding members of the American California Trial Lawyers Association. He also pursued other business interests, including being one of the four founding members in the 1970s of Decimus, a company which leased IBM mainframe computers to corporations. Jess Jackson, owner of Jackson Family Wines and Stonestreet Farms In 1974, Jackson and then wife, Jane Kendall Jackson, purchased an 80-acre pear-and-walnut orchard in Lakeport. He converted it to growing premium Chardonnay and other varietals after realizing that there was increasing demand for high-quality grapes in the area. He sold the property's grapes to local wineries until 1981, when a down market led to a surplus of grapes on the market. Faced with the prospect of selling his grapes for a price that wouldn't cover the costs of growing them, he decided to make his own wine. Instead of following the market by producing low-quality, inexpensive wines, Jackson studied the market and realized that there was a shortage of high-quality wines at affordable prices. He decided to produce wines that would fill that gap, and, two years later, he released the first Kendall-Jackson Vintner's Reserve Chardonnay. That year it became the first wine to ever win a Platinum Award from the American Wine Competition. Jackson and Kendall divorced in the early 1980s and Jackson later married Barbara Banke. Banke became his lifelong partner and co-manager of their wine businesses. Jackson and Banke continued to expand their business, eventually owning about 25,000 acres in California, 14,000 of which were planted with wine grapes. In 1992, Jackson prevailed in a highly contentious lawsuit against his former winemaker Jed Steele that prohibited Steele from revealing the formula for the Vintner's Reserve Chardonnay. In 1997, Jackson lost a lawsuit against E & J Gallo Winery in which Jackson alleged that Gallo's Turning Leaf label was a ripoff of his Vintner's Reserve. Among the wineries in his Jackson Family Wines portfolio, as of 2009, are Kendall-Jackson, Murphy-Goode, Robert Pecota Winery, Byron Estates, Edmeades, Matanzas Creek, La Crema, Stonestreet, Arrowood, Lajota, Cardinale, Atalon, Lokoya, Carmel Road, Cambria, V√©rit√©, Archipel, Chateau Potelle, and Freemark Abbey Winery. As of early 2009, it was ranked as the ninth largest winery holding company in the United States. Jackson's brands at the time of his death were producing 5 million cases of wine annually. In 2005, Jackson was listed by Forbes Magazine as the 366th wealthiest person in the world (tied with many others), with 1.8 billion dollars in assets. The 2010 list by Forbes Magazine placed Jackson as the 536th richest person in the world with 1.9 billion dollars in assets. ==Vintner's Hall of Fame== Every year the Culinary Institute of America sponsors the induction of wine industry leaders into the Vintner's Hall of Fame. Nominees are selected by a nominating committee, which creates the list of nominees that is later voted on by group of wine writers, critics, historians, and past inductees. The nominees with the most votes are then inducted into the Vintner's Hall of Fame. Jess Jackson was inducted into the Vintner's Hall of Fame in 2009 for his outstanding contributions to the wine industry. He was among several other industry luminaries being inducted that year, including winemaker Warren Winiarski, whose Stag's Leap Cabernet Sauvignon won first place over Chateau Mouton Rothschild and Chateau Haut- Brion in the 1976 Judgment of Paris and forever changed the way California wines were viewed worldwide, and the legendary Beringer Brothers, whose award- winning wines helped to establish Napa Valley's reputation as a top grape- growing region. ==Vintner's Reserve Chardonnay== Kendall-Jackson Vintner's Reserve Chardonnay debuted in 1982 with a 16,000 case production. In 1983, Vintner's Reserve Chardonnay won first ever Platinum Award from the American Wine Competition. Not coincidentally, American's taste for the Chardonnay picked up at the same time. The wine is characterized as an oaky chardonnay with a slightly more residual sugar. Kendall-Jackson Vintner's Reserve help Chardonnay become the most popular grape varietal amongst American wine drinkers. Vintner's Reserve Chardonnay is the most popular selling wine made from that varietal, which makes it the most popular wine in America. Ray Isle of Food and Wine Magazine ranked Vintner's Reserve Chardonnay as one of his \\"50 Wines You Can Always Trust\\" in April 2007. Kendall-Jackson Vintner's Reserve Chardonnay is also a staple in the household of Barack Obama. ==Thoroughbred horse racing== Jackson won the horseraceinsider.com award Sportsman of the Year 2008 Insider Award: \\"To owner Jess Jackson for believing in the greatness of his beloved Curlin then went above and beyond the call to prove it.\\" In 2007, he bought a controlling interest in Curlin, who won the Preakness Stakes and the Breeders' Cup Classic that year. In 2008, the horse won the $6 million Dubai World Cup. Fresh on the heels of Curlin's success, Jackson's Stonestreet Stables, along with Harold T. McCormick, announced on May 6, 2009, the purchase of Rachel Alexandra, winner of the Kentucky Oaks by more than 20 lengths and undefeated in 2009. On May 16, 2009, she won the 2009 Preakness Stakes. She was also named 2009 American Horse of the Year and was bred to Curlin upon her retirement. The resulting offspring, a colt, was named \\"Jess's Dream\\".

Cornish Language Partnership. is a village and civil parish in Cornwall, England. It is about five miles (8 km) southeast of Redruth.Ordnance Survey: Landranger map sheet 204 Truro & Falmouth . In the 18th and early 19th centuries Gwennap parish was the richest copper mining district in Cornwall, and was called the \\"richest square mile in the Old World\\". It is near the course of the Great County Adit which was constructed to drain mines in the area including several of the local once-famous mines such as Consolidated Mines, Poldice mine and Wheal Busy. Today it forms part of area A6i (the Gwennap Mining District) of the Cornwall and West Devon Mining Landscape World Heritage Site. Gwennap Pit It lends its name to Gwennap Pit, where John Wesley preached 18 times between 1762 and 1789, although Gwennap Pit is about to the northwest, at the hamlet of Busveal near St Day. The pit was caused by mining subsidence in the mid-18th century. After Wesley's death the local people turned the pit into a regular circular shape with turf seats. ==Church history== Gwennap church is dedicated to St Wenappa; in 1225 it was given to the chapter of Exeter by Lord William Briwere. The parish church is an old foundation, but was rebuilt in the 15th century because of population growth caused by mining and then thoroughly restored in the 19th century. The tower is detached. In 1882, following the removal of the centre gallery, which was said to be an eyesore, The Cornishman newspaper described the church as one of the prettiest in Cornwall. It was later described by Charles Henderson, as \\"few Cornish churches are less interesting than Gwennap\\".Cornish Church Guide (1925); pp. 105‚Äì06 , The cross in the churchyard There is a Cornish cross in the churchyard which was moved to the vicarage garden in the 1840s from Chapel Moor. It has a crude crucifixus figure and a small Latin cross on the front and a large Latin cross on the back and is probably a fragment of a larger cross. There is also an ornamented cross shaft which was found in the church wall about 1860 and by mistake used again in the vestry foundations.Langdon, A. G. (1896) Old Cornish Crosses. Truro: Joseph Pollard; pp. 148-49 & 403-04 ==Copper and tin mining== Mining in Gwennap is an industry stretching back to prehistoric times when tin streaming in the Carnon Valley is believed to have occurred. In surrounding valleys stones of cassiterite (SnO2) were washed downstream from outcropping lodes and trapped in the alluvial mud where they could be easily extracted. Later these outcropping tin lodes were worked by 'bounders' and the open workings (coffins) of these early miners are still partially visible at Penstruthal. Early evidence of the antiquity of mining in Gwennap is recorded in the Stannary Roll of 1305‚Äì06 which notes that Johannes Margh of Trevarth sent thirty shipments of tin to Truro. In 1512 two local men were overheard quarrelling in Cornish about the theft of \\"tynne at Poldyth in Wennap\\". Tin raised in Gwennap was dressed and smelted locally. Early modern 'crazing mills' powered by water, such as that which existed at Penventon, were built to grind, and later stamp the tin ore. This released cassiterite which was then smelted in local 'burning houses'. Demand for charcoal in the smelting process rapidly depleted Gwennap's ancient woodland, leaving a wild, moorland, landscape. Deep exploitation of the tin lodes was not possible with the limited technology of the early modern period as Cornish mines were wet due to the high rainfall of the area. De-watering workings at depth with 'rag and chain pumps', leather bags or 'kibbles' (metal buckets) were all ineffective. Deep lode mining was only made possible by two innovations, the first of which occurred in 1748, when John Williams of Scorrier House initiated the construction of the Great County Adit, a phenomenal feat of engineering, which drained mine workings through a system of adits. Over the next century this was extended from Poldice to include many other mines consisting of 63 miles (101 km) of tunnels in all. The other remarkable invention was that of the steam engine, allowing mines to be de-watered to greater depths. As one of Britain's earliest industrial regions, Gwennap had by the early 19th century become synonymous with steam technology, attracting Britain's top engineers including Boulton & Watt and William Murdoch. Together with Cornish engineers such as Loam, Sims, Woolf, Hornblower and Richard Trevithick, these men enabled the pumping engine to perform beyond the expectations of the time. A great many of these pumps and engines were installed by Richard Michell (1748‚Äì1836) of Gwennap and his descendants. In November 1806 he and four others, namely Captain John Martin, Captain John Dennis, Captain W. Davey and Captain T. Trestrail, met at Busveal and agreed to repair Gwennap Pit, or rather reconstruct the amphitheatre in respect to and in memory of John Wesley. It opened and had preaching in it on 18 June 1807. His eldest son, Francis (1780‚Äì1860) followed in his fathers footsteps expanding the practice to include steam engine drives for corn mills and a small workshop and foundry in Redruth. He also patented a boiler gauge. His only son, Francis William Michell (1828‚Äì1901), was responsible for the installation of over one hundred of these pumps and engines at numerous mines. With his cousin Richard Henry Michell (1817‚Äì1894), he went into partnership building a dredge and entering into a contract to dredge a dock at Cardiff. The family continued to be involved in the mining industry well into the 20th century.Michell, Frank (1984). Michell ‚Äì A Family of Cornish Engineers 1740‚Äì1910. Trevithick Society. . Such innovations coincided with an increased national demand for copper, needed in the brass parts for the machinery of the Industrial Revolution. By 1779 copper was ousting tin as the main mineral extracted, but it was the period from 1815 to 1840 which was the heyday of mining in Gwennap. This era saw the rise of huge mining enterprises including the Consolidated, United, and Tresavean Mines. Consolidated yielded almost 300,000 tons of copper between 1819 and 1840 which sold for over ¬£2 million. Gwennap the \\"Copper Kingdom\\" was then the richest known mineralised area in the world. Mining rapidly transformed the landscape. Consolidated Mines alone had nineteen engine houses for pumping, winding and crushing: the red waste rock from deep underground lay strewn about the moors and the valleys constantly echoed to the roar of the 'stamps'. Another visible sign of industrialisation was the construction of mineral tramways which transported copper ore and Welsh coal to and from coastal ports more efficiently than packs of mules. In 1809 a horse-drawn tramway was constructed between Portreath and Scorrier which was later extended to Poldice and Crofthandy. This was followed by the building of the Redruth-Chasewater Railway in 1824 running from Pedn-an-Drea and Wheal Buller, Redruth to Devoran. Mining reached its technical apogee in Gwennap in the 1840s with the installation of the first ever man engine in Britain at Tresavean Mine; but the nature of the area's geology, which had bestowed such wealth, eventually proved its downfall. View of the now defunct Wheal Unity mine to the east of St Day. This image shows the badly scarred landscape of the area.Frogpool Methodist Church In the nearby Camborne-Redruth district, rich deposits of tin were found below the copper. In Gwennap no such deposits were found and when low prices caused the collapse of the copper market in the 1860s, many mines were forced to close or amalgamate. Consolidated and United were incorporated into Clifford Amalgamated mine. Many of the mines that continued or went over to tin production could not survive the rising cost of coal and the fluctuations of mineral prices, causing a second wave of closures in the mid-1870s. Few mines survived the troubled times of the late 19th century, but Tresavean was one success story. Brought back to life as a tin mine in 1908 it was the second deepest mine in Cornwall at when it closed in 1928. Other mines that were resurrected in the 20th century include Wheal Gorland, worked for tungsten before the World War I, Wheal Busy, Mount Wellington, Whiteworks, Poldice, Parc an Chy, and Wheal Jane. The last mine to work commercially was South Crofty Mine at Pool near Redruth which ceased operation in March 1998 bringing to a close over 2,000 years of mining in the Gwennap area.Adapted from panel in St Day Church by the Mining Villages Regeneration Project ==Notable people== Gwennap was the birthplace of John Verran, Premier of South Australia, and of John Lawn, a New Zealand gold miner. ==ReferencesFurther reading== *James, C.

A member of the Indian National Congress, Patil is the only woman to have held the office. She previously served as the Governor of Rajasthan from 2004 to 2007. ==Early life== Pratibha Devisingh Patil is the daughter of Narayan Rao Patil. She was born on 19 December 1934 in the village of Nadgaon, in the Jalgaon district of Maharashtra, India. She was educated initially at R. R. Vidyalaya, Jalgaon, and subsequently was awarded a master's degree in Political Science and Economics by Mooljee Jetha College, Jalgaon (then under Poona University), and then a Bachelor of Law degree by Government Law College, Bombay, affiliated to the University of Bombay (now University of Mumbai). Patil then began to practice law at the Jalgaon District Court, while also taking interest in social issues such as improving the conditions faced by Indian women. Patil married Devisingh Ransingh Shekhawat on 7 July 1965. The couple have a daughter and a son, Raosaheb Shekhawat, who is also a politician. ==Political career== President Patil with the Prime Minister of Nepal, Madhav Kumar, in New Delhi on 19 August 19, 2009 The BBC has described Patil's political career prior to assuming presidential office as \\"long and largely low-key\\". In 1962, at the age of 27, she was elected to the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly for the Jalgaon constituency. Thereafter she won in the Muktainagar (formerly Edlabad) constituency on four consecutive occasions between 1967 and 1985, before becoming a Member of Parliament in the Rajya Sabha between 1985 and 1990. In the 1991 elections for the 10th Lok Sabha, she was elected as a Member of Parliament representing the Amravati constituency. A period of retirement from politics followed later in the decade. Patil had held various Cabinet portfolios during her period in the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly and she had also held official positions while in both the Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha. In addition, she had been for some years the president of the Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee and also held office as Director of the National Federation of Urban Co-operative Banks and Credit Societies and as a Member of the Governing Council of the National Co-operative Union of India. On 8 November 2004 she was appointed as the 24th Governor of Rajasthan, the first woman to hold that office and according to the BBC was \\"a low-profile\\" incumbent. ==Presidency== Pratibha Devisingh Patil with the then Vice President, Mohammad Hamid Ansari, and then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh Election Patil was announced as the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) candidate on 14 June 2007. She emerged as a compromise candidate after the left-wing parties of the alliance would not agree to the nomination of former Home Minister Shivraj Patil or Karan Singh. Patil had been loyal to the INC and the Nehru‚ÄìGandhi family for decades and this was considered to be a significant factor in her selection by INC leader Sonia Gandhi, although Patil said that she had no intention of being a \\"rubber-stamp president\\". In the same month that she was selected, as a member of the UPA Patil was accused of shielding her brother, G. N. Patil, in the 2005 Vishram Patil murder case. Vishram Patil had narrowly defeated G. N. Patil in an election to be the President of the District Congress Committee of Jalgaon and in September of that year had been murdered. Vishram Patil's widow eventually accused G. N. Patil of involvement in the crime and claimed that Pratibha Patil had influenced the criminal investigation and that the issue needed to be examined before presidential immunity became active. Her accusations were rejected by the courts in 2009 but in 2015 G. N. Patil was charged. No reference to the alleged involvement of Pratibha Patil was made at this time. Due to the presidential role being largely a figurehead position, the selection of the candidate is often arranged by consensus among the various political parties and the candidate runs unopposed. Contrary to the normal pattern of events, Patil faced a challenge in the election. The BBC described the situation as \\"the latest casualty of the country's increasingly partisan politics and [it] highlights what is widely seen as an acute crisis of leadership\\". It \\"degenerated into unseemly mudslinging between the ruling party and the opposition\\". Her challenger was Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, the incumbent vice- president and a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) veteran. Shekhawat stood as an independent candidate and was supported by the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), a group led by the BJP, although the Shiv Sena party, which was a part of NDA, supported her because of her Marathi origin. Those opposed to Patil becoming president claimed that she lacked charisma, experience, and ability. They also highlighted her time spent away from high-level politics and queried her belief in the supernatural, such as her claim to have received a message from Dada Lekhraj, a dead guru. Various specific issues were raised, such as a comment made by her in 1975 that those suffering from hereditary diseases should be sterilized. Another alleged that while a Member of Parliament for Amravati she diverted Rs 3.6 million from her MPLADS fund to a trust run by her husband. This was in violation of Government rules which barred MPs from providing funds to organizations run by their relatives. The parliamentary affairs minister denied any wrongdoing on Patil's part, and noted that the funds utilized under MPLADS are audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India. Patil won the election held on 19 July 2007. She garnered nearly two-thirds of the votes and took office as India's first woman president on 25 July 2007. In office Patil in 2007 President Patil speaking at the Doon School's Platinum Jubilee in October 2010. Air Warrior Symphony Orchestra at the auditorium in the Rashtrapati Bhavan. Patil's term as the President of India saw various controversies and is widely considered as lacklustre. She commuted death sentences of 35 petitioners to life, a record. President's Office, however, defended this by saying that President had granted clemency to the petitioners after due consideration and examining the advice of the Home Ministry. Patil was noted for having spent more money on foreign trips, and having taken a greater number of foreign trips, than any previous president. Sometimes accompanied by as many as 11 members of her family, there had been 12 foreign trips spanning 22 countries by May 2012, when she was away on her 13th trip. Those completed travels had cost Rs 205 crore (Rs 2.05 billion). The Ministry of External Affairs said that taking family members \\"was not abnormal\\". The Office of President has a five-year term and Patil retired from the role in July 2012. Patil allegedly used public funds to build a retirement mansion on a plot of military land in Pune.Tradition is that a retiring president either takes residence in Government accommodation in Delhi or moves back to their residence in their home state;her use of government money to build a retirement home at the end of the presidential term was unprecedented. Other controversies that arose after her retirement included her desire to claim both an official government car and fuel allowance for the running of a private car, despite rules clearly stipulating that this was an either/or situation. She also took possession of many gifts that had been given to her in her official role and was later forced to return them. ==Business interests== Patil set up Vidya Bharati Shikshan Prasarak Mandal, an educational institute which runs a chain of schools and colleges in Amravati, Jalgaon, Pune and Mumbai. She also set up Shram Sadhana Trust, which runs hostels for working women in New Delhi, Mumbai and Pune; and an engineering college for rural students in Jalgaon district. She also co-founded a cooperative sugar factory known as Sant Muktabai Sahakari Sakhar Karkhana at Muktainagar. In addition, Patil founded a cooperative bank, Pratibha Mahila Sahakari Bank, that ceased trading in February 2003 when its licence was cancelled by the Reserve Bank of India. Among other failings, the bank had given illegal loans to her relatives that exceeded the bank's share capital. It had also given a loan to her sugar mill which was never repaid. The bank waived these loans, and this drove it into liquidation. The government liquidator of the bank, P. D. Nigam, said, \\"The fact that relatives of the founder chairperson (Pratibha Patil) were among those indiscriminately granted loans and that some illegal loan waivers were done has come up in our audit.\\" Six of the top ten defaulters in the bank were linked to her relatives. The INC claimed that Patil had not been involved with the bank since 1994 but The Indian Express reported that it had official documents showing her involvement as late as 2002. ==Positions held== Pratibha Patil has held various official offices during her career.

Born in Croydon, Surrey, he is best remembered for the twelve Flaxborough novels, typified by their comic and dry wit and set in a fictional small town in England which is closely based on Boston, Lincolnshire. He worked as a journalist in Lincolnshire and the characters in his books are said to be highly recognisable caricatures of people he encountered in his work. His 1971 study of interwar thrillers 'Snobbery With Violence', made the phrase popular for describing such authors as Dornford Yates. Watson was the first person to successfully sue Private Eye for libel, for an article in issue 25 when he objected to being described as: ‚Äúthe little-known author who . . . was writing a novel, very Wodehouse but without the jokes‚Äù. He was awarded ¬£750.https://www.theguardian.com/media/2001/oct/07/pressandpublishing.politics He died in Folkingham, Lincolnshire in 1983. ==Inspector Walter Purbright== The central character in the Flaxborough Chronicles, Inspector Walter Purbright, is perhaps not the most intellectually dazzling detective in fiction. He does, though, provide an unusually solid core of decency and civilisation around which more fanciful and sometimes whimsical events can be strung. His understanding of the case in hand emerges from a process of polite, measured enquiry. Purbright's decency is at the heart of Watson's thesis: that civilised life depends on basic tolerance, decency and the honesty of its guardians. His commitment to total impartiality, his refusal to be deflected by special interests and social position and his scrupulous refusal to cut procedural corners all go to make up a quintessentially English hero. == Miss Teatime == Miss Lucilla Edith Cavell Teatime is a ladylike conwoman whose occasional lapses into verbal vulgarity make her all the more endearing. She has a liking for whisky, a game of dominoes and all things tasteful. She first steps off the train in Flaxborough (a town once described as having the fictional solidarity of Arnold Bennett's Five Towns) in the fourth mystery set there, Lonelyheart 4122. She likes the town so much that she settles there, even though her attempt at swindling through a lonely- hearts bureau nearly makes her the third woman killed by another swindler. She appears in all subsequent Flaxborough novels except Blue Murder. By the eleventh volume, Plaster Sinners, she is the proprietress of the 'House of Yesteryear' in Northgate, Flaxborough, and a regular attender at local auctions. Her odd talents and sleight of hand remain much in evidence. On one occasion two glass decanters are rendered extremely cheap when she casually transfers the stoppers to a tray of miscellaneous items, which she then bids for as well. Her final appearance is in Whatever's Been Going On At Mumblesby? where we find her with an assistant called Edgar and offering opinions on the marketability of such religious relics as saints' kneecaps. In the 1977 Murder Most English BBC television series, which offered adaptations of four of Colin Watson's Flaxborough novels, Lucy Teatime was portrayed by Brenda Bruce. ==Adaptations== Four of the Flaxborough novels were adapted for television by the BBC under the series title Murder Most English. The four were Hopjoy Was Here, Lonelyheart 4122, The Flaxborough Crab and Coffin Scarcely Used. The adaptations successfully reflected key elements of the books: the gentle behind-the-times feel of a small English market town, the merciless targeting of the pretensions of some of the town's social leaders, and the author‚Äôs notion that whatever exotic trappings are used to decorate the plot, the central crime is always motivated by money. Anton Rodgers starred as Purbright with Christopher Timothy as Detective Sergeant Love and Brenda Bruce as Miss Lucilla Teatime. Colin Watson produced the ninth Flaxborough novel, One Man's Meat, to coincide with the series. Although the novels are based on the Lincolnshire market town of Boston, some scenes for the adaptation were filmed in the much smaller market town of Alford, also in Lincolnshire. In that town, the original Victorian police station - complete with huge wooden hooks in the walls for the sergeants' horses' saddles - had only been replaced by a new police station four years earlier, in 1974. Hence, it was available, with all its trappings, for the production company. Two of the novels were adapted for BBC Radio 4, Bump in the Night (1971) and Charity Ends at Home (1992). ==Bibliography== The Flaxborough Novels *Coffin, Scarcely Used (1958) *Bump in the Night (1960) *Hopjoy Was Here (1962) *Lonelyheart 4122 (1967) *Charity Ends at Home (1968) *The Flaxborough Crab (1969) - U.S: Just What the Doctor Ordered *Broomsticks over Flaxborough (1972) - U.S: Kissing Covens *The Naked Nuns (1975) - U.S: Six Nuns and a Shotgun *One Man's Meat (1977) - U.S: It Shouldn't Happen to a Dog *Blue Murder (1979) *Plaster Sinners (1980) *Whatever's Been Going on at Mumblesby?

It is published by Wydawnictwo Portal (Portal Publishing House). The game is set in the same post-apocalyptic world as its RPG counterpart. == Gameplay == Neuroshima Hex is played on a hexagonal board. Each player periodically draws from a deck of hexagonal cards called \\"tiles.\\" Tiles symbolize different types of military units. Annotations on the tiles denote the combat strength of each unit. Each player has one special tile called HQ (headquarters). Players take turns placing their tiles on the board. The player chooses: * which tile from their hand to play, * where to place the tile on the board, and * what orientation the tile should have. Being hexagonal, there are six possible orientations for placing each tile. Normally a card does not move once placed on the board. Periodically a tile is played that initializes combat. At that time, cards are removed from the board based on the outcome of combat between pairs of nearby opposing cards. The game is nominally concluded when all tiles from the deck have been exhausted. The winner is determined by which HQ has taken the least combat damage. 400px There are three major categories of tiles in each player's deck: * One tile representing HQ. This is always drawn and placed on the board by each player first. Other than HQ, the remaining tiles are sorted randomly in the deck. * Units (also called \\"soldiers\\") are tiles representing military units. Annotations on a Unit card denotes its combat strength: ** how much damage does that unit inflict on enemy units ** whether that damage can only be done to adjacent tiles (\\"melee attack\\" markings) or more distant tiles (\\"ranged attack\\") markings ** in what direction that damage takes place (annotations on multiple sides of the hexagon denote the ability to attack in multiple directions simultaneously) ** \\"toughness,\\" meaning how much damage can a unit sustain before it is withdrawn from the playing board ** special abilities such as defense from ranged attack, or the ability prevent an enemy unit from attacking entirely (so-called \\"net\\" units) * Modules are tiles that augment the abilities of adjacent cards: ** increasing the strength of their attack ** increasing the range of their attack ** increasing their toughness (ability to withstand attacks) ** increasing the priority of their attack in the attack sequence of all the other tiles on the board (tiles take turns attacking one another based on another set of markings on each tile) ** healing damaged tiles ** allowing a tile to be relocated after being placed on the board At the start of each player's turn, they draw three tiles at random from their deck. One tile must be discarded. The remaining two tiles may be placed on the board. Tiles cannot be placed on top of other tiles. The player may opt to discard more than one tile. Players take turns in this fashion until the board is partially populated with tiles. Randomly a player may draw a tile that allows the player to initiate combat. When this occurs, gameplay pauses while combat is resolved. Annotations on the tiles denote what priority each card has in the combat sequence. Cards marked with a \\"3\\" have first priority, \\"2\\" second priority, and \\"1\\" third priority. In other words, tiles marked with a \\"3\\" get to attack first. Once the outcome of those attacks are resolved (i.e., \\"dead\\" units are removed from the board) then tiles marked with a \\"2\\" get to attack, and so on. Once all phases of combat (phases 3, 2, 1, 0) have concluded normal gameplay resumes. The objective of the game is to attack the enemy's HQ. Each HQ starts with 20 hit points. Gameplay concludes when one HQ is down to 0 hit points, or when all the tiles have been exhausted from a player's deck. The winner is determined by the player's HQ that has the most remaining hit points. The game offers four armies (denoted by four different color schemes for tiles) which differ in their strength, mobility and flexibility, as denoted by differing annotations on each army's tiles. Normally the game is played by two players, though three and four player variations exist. As a card game, Neuroshima Hex is essentially a much more complex version of War. In terms of strategy, Neuroshima Hex is similar to chess in that play emphasizes correct placement of pieces on the board, with occasional combat removing pieces from the board. The game is also available as a video game, with rules essentially identical to the board game, albeit with combat between tiles automated via software. == Publication == Micha≈Ç Oracz presents game on Essen Spiel 2007 A second edition (in English) was released at SPIEL (the Essen game fair) in 2007, and a promotional 5th army (Doomsday Machine) was given to buyers at the Portal Publishing booth.

It was filmed in October and November 1928, and released February 23, 1929, by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Although a silent film, it was released with a synchronized music and sound-effects track in theaters equipped for sound. == Plot == Stable grooms Laurel and Hardy overhear news of a $5,000 reward for the return of the stolen painting The Blue Boy, but think the reward is for the horse at their barn named Blue Boy. The police eventually recover the Blue Boy painting and are making plans to return it. When the grooms bring the horse to the painting's owner, he speaks to them from an upstairs window where he can't see the steed; he tells them to bring Blue Boy into the house. The three come clumping through the front door while the millionaire upstairs takes a bath. Ollie has an altercation with a nude statue, which snaps into three pieces after the two tumble to the floor; Hardy safeguards the statue's modesty by wrapping its bare torso in his coat while he reassembles it. When the statue's back upright and Ollie removes the coat, the torso segment is backwards, so its backside protrudes out from where its midriff should be. The millionaire calls down from upstairs, \\"Put him on top of the piano\\". Working together, the boys manage to lead the horse over to the grand piano, and up he leaps to his high perch. Things seem fine, when suddenly a piano leg gives way and Ollie is left holding things up. During all this, the horse keeps on trying to knock Stan's hat off, often succeeding. The millionaire's mother returns home, the police arrive with the real Blue Boy, the recovered painting, and the refreshed millionaire descends from his bath, whereupon the misunderstanding is revealed. Ollie apologizes for the \\"faux pas\\", and he, Stan and Blue Boy make a hasty exit, followed by the irate millionaire with a shotgun. In the process, the priceless painting gets knocked to the floor on top of one of the detectives. ==CastProduction notes== Wrong Again contains a sight gag unknown to modern audiences. When the team first bring their equine meal ticket into the house, Stan lifts the lid off an urn, ties Blue Boy's rein to it and drops it on the floor. 1929 audiences would laugh at this, as the insubstantial lid is a visual dead ringer for a horse anchor, an item still common in 1929. Drivers of horse- drawn wagons making deliveries would literally \\"drop anchor\\" while they ran their delivery into a house; the horse would be discouraged from wandering by the 25-pound weight of the anchor. This is not the only appearance of a horse anchor in a Laurel and Hardy film: they also have one at the ready in their Model T in the 1934 short Going Bye-Bye! to discourage the car from wandering away. The working title of Wrong Again was Just the Reverse, a reference to the 180-degree hand-twist gesture that is a running gag throughout the film. Laurel and Hardy historian Randy Skretvedt writes that the gesture was a running gag around the Hal Roach Studios: creative sparkplug Leo McCarey would remind the writers that a dramatic episode could be infused with comedy by applying just a twist to make it funny. The gesture became a staple of writer- to-writer communication around the studio.Skretvedt, Randy, 1996. Laurel and Hardy: The Magic Behind the Movies. Beverly Hills, CA: Past Times Publishing. The stable scenes were shot at a Los Angeles sports complex, polo field and ranch known as The Uplifters in Rustic Canyon. == Critical response == Wrong Again is one of the several silent Laurel and Hardy short films that were made with a synchronized music and sound effects track; after its initial theatrical run in 1929, it was rarely seen, and was overshadowed by the sound films. It would eventually be available in a home-edition 8mm or 16mm film, and, as such, almost always without its soundtrack. Critic William K. Everson was among the first to cast a critical eye on the Laurel and Hardy films. Writing of Wrong Again in 1967, \\"An off-beat comedy that can only be seen at a disadvantage now in that it was made as both a silent and limited sound release, and undoubtedly paced for sound. Today [1967] only the silent version survives, and at times seems awkward and unsure of itself. Nevertheless, it has some very funny moments.... There is a semi-surrealistic quality to many of the sight gags in Wrong Again.\\"Everson, William K. (1967). The Films of Laurel and Hardy. Secaucus, NJ: Citadel Press. , p. 76 Silent film authority Bruce Calvert commented, \\"This entertaining film is one of Laurel and Hardy's most bizarre,\\"Calvert, Bruce at Allmovie.com, http://www.allmovie.com/work/137563 while prolific critic Leslie Halliwell takes the opposite stand: \\"Pleasing but not very inventive star comedy.\\"Walker, John, ed. (1994). Halliwell's Film Guide. New York: HarperPerennial. , p. 1329. Glenn Mitchell added Wrong Again is among the most original Laurel and Hardy comedies, its gags alternately bizarre, risqu√© and imaginative knockabout.... The best copies of Wrong Again incorporate a restored disc accompaniment from the original release. The skilled orchestral arrangement and appropriate sound effects transform the film into a minor masterpiece, reminding modern audiences of the way silent films were presented at their zenith.\\", p. 293 == References  External links == * * * Category:1929 films Category:English-language films Category:1929 comedy films Category:American silent short films Category:American black-and-white films Category:Films directed by Leo McCarey Category:Laurel and Hardy (film series) Category:American films Category:Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer short films Category:Films with screenplays by H.

Archived from the original on 19 September 2009. Clark made an impressive debut for the Brisbane Lions in the first round of the 2006 season against Geelong, converting his first mark and subsequent kick into a goal, but his debut season was significantly hampered by injury problems, in particular osteitis pubis,Mitchell Clark Player Profile bio, lions.com.au, retrieved 2009-09-19. and only ended up playing a total six games that season. Clark played his first game for the 2007 season in round nine against Collingwood, after overcoming his injury problems. His five goals in that match earned him an AFL Rising Star nomination. However, the promising return lasted only three weeks before Clark was hit by injury again, allowing him only one more game that season. Even before the 2008 season began, Clark was already in injury strife, after injuring his quad during pre-season training. Clark played his first game for 2008 in round seven against , and lost by 27 points after falling away in the last quarter. Clark kicked three goals in the process. He managed to string together twelve consecutive games for the season, but was sidelined for the remainder after the round 18 clash with , during which he injured his quads yet again. 2009 turned out to be a breakthrough year for Clark. Season-ending injuries to Matthew Leuenberger and Jamie Charman resulted in Clark shouldering the Brisbane ruck duties for the majority of the season. Leaving his injury prone tendencies behind, Clark played in all 24 possible games, including two finals. By the end of the season, Clark had gained acknowledgement as one the competition's elite mobile ruckmen, was rewarded by selection in the 40-man All-Australian squad, and was considered unlucky to miss out on selection in the final team. Melbourne (2012-2014) At the completion of the 2011 season Clark informed the Brisbane Lions he would not be renewing his contract with the club and that he desired a move home to Perth. Fremantle Dockers were close to signing the key position player but equivocated on compensation for the Lions, and Clark was eventually swayed by a significantly better offer from the Melbourne Demons, which also provided a better result for the Lions. He was given the number 11 guernsey at the Demons, made famous by Jim Stynes, who also presented it to him. Clark starred in the first half of his debut season, kicking 29 goals in 11 games to sit equal-fourth in the Coleman Medal, before tearing his Lisfranc ligament in his foot against GWS in round 13. This injury ruled him out for the rest of the season and held him back in 2013 as well, where he played just the four games. In April 2014 Clark announced his immediate retirement from football, due to clinical depression and personal issues.  Geelong (2015-2016)  On 15 October 2014 Clark was traded to the Cats in a deal which saw Travis Varcoe join and Heritier Lumumba join Melbourne.Clark a Cat, three-way deal sees Varcoe join Magpies, AFL.com.au official website, 15 October 2014 At the conclusion of the 2016 season, he was delisted by Geelong. ==Statistics== : - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" center\\"  2006   1  6  3  2  32  17  49  18  17  20  0.5  0.3  5.3  2.9  8.2  3.0  2.8  3.3 - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text- align:center\\"  2007   1  4  7  6  25  11  36  19  5  8  1.8  1.5  6.3  2.8  9.1  4.8  1.3  2.0 - style=\\"background- color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" center\\"  2008   1  12  8  7  73  44  117  48  18  49  0.7  0.6  6.1  3.7  9.8  4.0  1.5  4.1 - ! scope=\\"row\\" center\\"  2009   1  24  7  7  192  198  390  144  94  528  0.3  0.3  8.0  8.3  16.3  6.0  3.9  22.0 - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" center\\"  2010   1  19  9  9  166  118  284  99  50  215  0.5  0.5  8.7  6.2  14.9  5.2  4.6  11.3 - ! scope=\\"row\\" center\\"  2011   1  17  27  13  159  78  237  83  34  82  1.6  0.8  9.4  4.6  14.0  4.9  2.0  4.8 - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" center\\"  2012   11  11  29  18  108  31  139  53  41  21  2.6  1.6  9.8  2.8  12.6  4.8  3.7  1.9 - ! scope=\\"row\\" center\\"  2013   11  4  7  2  25  10  35  14  6  2  1.8  0.5  6.3  2.5  8.8  3.5  1.5  0.5 - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text- align:center\\"  2014   11  0  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî - ! scope=\\"row\\" center\\"  2015   19  8  14  6  59  28  87  35  16  15  1.8  0.8  7.4  3.5  10.9  4.4  2.0  1.9 - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" center\\"  2016   19  1  0  0  3  7  10  3  3  5  0.0  0.0  3.0  7.0  10.0  3.0  3.0  5.0 - class=\\"sortbottom\\" ! colspan=3 Career ! 106 ! 111 ! 70 ! 842 ! 542 ! 1384 ! 416 ! 264 ! 965 ! 1.1 ! 0.7 ! 8.0 ! 5.1 ! 13.1 ! 4.9 ! 2.5 ! 9.1 } ==ReferencesExternal links== * * Category:1987 births Category:Living people Category:Australian rules footballers from Western Australia Category:Brisbane Lions players Category:Melbourne Football Club players Category:East Fremantle Football Club players Category:Geelong Football Club players ","title":"Mitch Clark (Australian footballer)"},{"id":"5604275","text":"Anna of Hungary may refer to: * Anna of Hungary, Duchess of Macs√≥ (born 1226), daughter of Bela IV of Hungary, wife of prince Rostislav Mikhailovich * Anna of Hungary (Byzantine empress) (c. 1260‚Äì1281), daughter of Stephen V of Hungary, first wife of Andronikos II Palaiologos. * Anne, Duchess of Luxembourg (1432‚Äì1462), daughter of Albert II of Germany, wife of her co-ruler William III, Duke of Luxembourg * Anna of Bohemia and Hungary (1503‚Äì1547), daughter of Vladislaus II of Bohemia and Hungary, wife of Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor * Archduchess Anna of Austria (1528‚Äì1590), daughter of Anna of Bohemia and Hungary, wife of Albert V, Duke of Bavaria * Anna of Austria (1549‚Äì1580), daughter of Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor, king of Hungary, fourth wife of Philip II of Spain * Anna of Tyrol (1585‚Äì1618), daughter of Ferdinand II, Archduke of Further Austria, wife of Matthias, Holy Roman Emperor, king of Hungary ","title":"Anna of Hungary (disambiguation)"},{"id":"5604278","text":"View of St Clement from the Truro road St Clement () is a civil parish and village in Cornwall, England, United Kingdom. It is situated southeast of Truro in the valley of the Tresillian River. Other notable villages within the parish are the much larger Tresillian 1.4 miles (2.3 km) to the north east of St Clement village itself and another village at Malpas to the south of the parish. The urban part of the parish of St Clement was incorporated into Truro in 1895. The remainder of the parish had a population of 1,064 at the 2011 census. St Clement is attractive for tourists: aside from the natural beauty of the surrounding countryside they come to see the village church and its associated conservation projects that are maintained by members of the local community. Unlike some other villages in the district, the village of St Clement has changed very little in recent times. The parish of St Clement lies within the Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). The Tresillian River includes many scenic paths leading to a walkway owned by the Duchy of Cornwall. ==History and antiquities== The old name of this place is Moresk ( Sea - water[s]) and there was a castle here in Norman times. The manor of Moresk was one of the seventeen Antiqua maneria of the Duchy of Cornwall. There was also an electoral ward of the former Kerrier District called Moresk. Malpas is nearer the Truro River: a road journey there means going via Truro (3.3 miles). Parish church The inscribed cross (Ignioc stone) The church is medieval but has lost much of its interest due to later restorations.Cornish Church Guide (1925) Truro: Blackford; pp. 73‚Äì74 John Betjeman is less critical than Charles Henderson of the restoration of 1865 and remarks on the graveyard inscriptions.Betjeman, J. (ed.) (1968) Collins Pocket Guide to English Parish Churches: the South. London: Collins; p. 151 The tower, in three stages, is built of slate and has a datestone for 1326 which corresponds to the style of building (however the third stage is of a later date). The rest of the church was decayed by the 1860s so most of the present fabric is from 1865 (however certain parts show genuine 13th-century work). The north transept has an arch matching the arcade of the south aisle (six bays in granite, nearly semi-circular arches and standard piers with elaborate capitals). The bells were recast by Messrs Warner and Sons of London in 1881. There are two notable monuments: to Samuel Thomas (d. 1796), the work of John Bacon, 1799, has two allegorical figures; the other is to Rear-Admiral Robert Carthew Reynolds, from the studio of Micali, Livorno, and shows a young soldier and two women, the soldier points to a monument with a naval battle, above is the portrait medallion.Pevsner, N.

London: Hodder & Stoughton; pp. 205-06 The battle is probably the engagement with the Droits de l'Homme. Captain Reynolds commanded the frigate Amazon in the Action of 13 January 1797 when, in company with HMS Indefatigable, the frigates engaged and drove ashore the much larger French ship of the line Droits de l'Homme. In the heavy storm in which the battle was fought, Amazon became unmanageable and was also wrecked, although the frigate was beached and all but six of her men survived, unlike her larger opponent which was run onto a sandbar and destroyed with hundreds of lives lost.James, Vol. 2, p. 17 ;Cross in churchyard The churchyard contains an inscribed stone cross: the first word of the inscription is perhaps isnioc (later opinion believes ignioc). The inscription is Ignioc Vitali fili Torrici (i.e. Ignioc son of Vitalus son of Torricus) and the dating is 5th to 7th century. Another inscription is in Ogham, perhaps partly in Irish.Pevsner (1970), p. 165 The inscriptions are both older than the carving of the upper part into a cross. Penair House The house was built by Rear-Admiral Robert Carthew Reynolds (d. 1811) and was the residence of his son Barrington Reynolds (1786‚Äì1861). This house replaced an older one at least going back as far as the 17th century. Pencalenick House Pencalenick House was a large country home on the banks of the Tresillian River. It was owned by a branch of the Vivian family from the 1700s. In 1797 John Vivian was the owner. By the 1870s, the house had passed to Captain J.C. Vivian the MP for Truro. In May 1879, a fire broke out in the vineyard and associated greenhouses. The house, by then owned by Michael Henry Williams, was rebuilt by J P St Aubyn in 1881 and stands in historic parklands. In 1882, for local government payments, the house was rated at ¬£300 per annum compared with the nearby Killiow mansion at ¬£80 and the larger Tregothnan at ¬£200. Williams died at Pencalenick aged 78 in 1902. In 1947, Cornwall County Council purchased Pencalenick House for ¬£10,000 (equivalent to ¬£ in 2018), with the intention of using it as a school for \\"sub-normal children\\".

He was the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh from 1978 to 1980 and from 1989 to 1990. He also served as the governor of Uttar Pradesh (1974‚Äì1977), governor of Punjab (1982‚Äì1983), governor of Rajasthan from February 1992 to May 1993, and governor of Tamil Nadu from 1993 until his death. He was a leader of Indian National Congress Party. Reddy was among the stalwarts who headed the Telangana movement of the Andhra Pradesh in the late 1960s. He also has the credit of being one of the youngest ministers; He became a minister of Andhra Pradesh at the age of 30. ==Early life== Marri Channa Reddy was born to Marri Lakshma Reddy and Buchamma on 13 January 1919 in Siripuram village (currently in Marpally Mandal), Atraf- i-Balda, Hyderabad State. He obtained his MBBS degree in 1941. He was the founder of Andhra Yuvajana Samiti and Students Congress. He was associated with several student, youth, social, educational, literary and cultural organisations. He edited a weekly for about two years and has also contributed articles to leading dailies and Journals. ==Political life== He took active part in the political struggle in the erstwhile Hyderabad State and in 1942 was the General Secretary of Andhra Mahasabha (which was a precursor of the State Congress). In 1946, he became a member of the Standing Committee of the State Congress and General Secretary of Hyderabad City Congress. He was one of the founders and as well General Secretary of the Ideological K.M.P.Group in the Congress. He was General Secretary of the Andhra Provincial Congress Committee for several years and a member of the P.C.C Working Committee for 30 years. Tenure as Member of Legislature and Parliament In 1950, Reddy was nominated to the Provisional Parliament and was appointed Whip of Congress Parliamentary Party. He was elected member of the Hyderabad Legislative Assembly in the first General Elections and from 1952‚Äì1956 was Minister for Agriculture and Food, Planning_and Rehabilitation in Hyderabad State. As Minister he held the Indian Delegation to the World Conference of Agriculturists held in Rome under the auspices of the F.A.O. in 1953, Subsequently, in 1955, he represented India as the Deputy Leader of the Indian Delegation to F.A.O. Conference in Rome. He opposed Telangana merger with Andhra State and was one of the four signatories to Gentleman's agreement after which Andhra Pradesh state formed. He was elected to the Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly again from Vikarabad constituency. During 1957‚Äì62, he was a member of the Public Accounts Committee, twice Chairman of the Estimates Committee and Chairman of the Andhra Pradesh Regional (Telangana) Development Committee in State Legislative Assemably. In 1962 he was again elected, now from Tandur Constituency, and was Minister for Planning and Panchayat Raj and later for Finance, Commercial Taxes and Industries. In 1967, he was again returned to the Legislative Assembly and was Minister for Finance, Education and Commercial Taxes. He resigned the State Ministry on his appointment as Minister for Steel, Mines and Metals in the Union Cabinet (1967‚Äì68). Subsequently, in April 1967, he was elected to the Rajya Sabha. As Minister for Steel and Mines, he introduced several reforms to improve production and brought about decontrol of distribution of steel and coal. At the invitation of the British Government he visited the U.K for talks on steel industry and other allied matters. He resigned from the Union Cabinet in April 1968. Role in the First Telangana Movement Reddy took an active part in several public movements and played a notable role in the split of the Congress political party. He also a took an active role in the movement for a separate Telangana State. Chenna Reddy became president of the Telangana Praja Samiti, then a popular youth movement, so as to politicalize the movement. This party supporting the separation secured the popular mandate in terms of winning 11 Loksabha seats (out of 14 seats). As head of the movement for separate Telangana he made a significant contribution in resolving the issues. He is credited for drafting of the Six Point Formula in 1971. This was later incorporated as 'New Deal for Telangana' in the Congress Manifesto when the elections to the Andhra Pradesh Assembly took place in 1972. ==Tenure as Governor of Uttar Pradesh== In 1974, Reddy accepted the office of Governor of Uttar Pradesh, the most populous State of the country on a reported personal plea of Indira Gandhi made that she required Reddy's assistance to help her as the Governor of Uttar Pradesh, her home State. However this is widely seen as a reward for ending the Separate Telangana Movement. As Chancellor for the state Universities, he set a practice of conferring Honorary Degrees on great scholars and renowned scientists from others parts of the country, particularly, from the South. He also administered the state when it came under President's rule within 55 days of him taking office. He sought advice from leaders of repute and public men like Nirmal Chandra Chaturvedi, CB Gupta and Ali Zaheer to cleanse the state administration. Tenure as Chief Minister He was twice the chief minister of Andhra Pradesh. Reddy successfully brought the congress party to power on two occasions. He was the Pradesh Congress Committee President. He has also been Governor of Uttar Pradesh (during president rule in the mid-1970s), Rajasthan, Punjab, Tamil Nadu and Pondicheri. He was actually the person who created the peace process and eradication of terrorism in Punjab while being the Governor there. ==Personal life== Reddy was married to M. Savitri Devi and had two sons and a daughter. His younger son, Marri Shashidhar Reddy, was Vice Chairman of National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) with a Union Cabinet status; he was also a four-time MLA from Sanathnagar. Reddy arrived in Hyderabad on 1 December 1996 from Chennai to attend his grandson's wedding. He was taken to a private hospital in the city after he complained of a chest pain at around midnight before he slipped into coma. He died at 7 a.m. (IST) the following day there. In an obituary, author Parsa Venkateshwar Rao wrote of Reddy: \\"Marri Chenna Reddy was an eternal rebel in Andhra politics. He never toed any line, be it a party or a leader. He dared his cautious peers, and did not hesitate to antagonise them though he never had permanent enemies. He held positions of power on his own terms, and lost them too for the same reasons.\\" ==References== Category:Union Ministers from Telangana Category:Telangana politicians Category:Telugu politicians Category:Indian National Congress politicians Category:People from Ranga Reddy district Category:People from Telangana Category:1919 births Category:1996 deaths Category:Chief ministers from Indian National Congress Category:Rajya Sabha members from Andhra Pradesh ","title":"Marri Chenna Reddy"},{"id":"5604332","text":"Madeleine of France may refer to: *Magdalena of France, daughter of Charles VII of France, mother of two monarchs of Navarre *Madeleine of France, daughter of Francis I of France, Queen of Scots ","title":"Madeleine of France"},{"id":"5604344","text":"Gaston, Prince of Viana, also called Gaston de Foix (1445 ‚Äì 23 November 1470), was the son of Gaston IV of Foix and Eleanor of Navarre, and was the heir of both.

Join, or Die. is a political cartoon attributed to Benjamin Franklin. The original publication by the Pennsylvania Gazette on May 9, 1754, is the earliest known pictorial representation of colonial union produced by an American colonist in Colonial America. It is a woodcut showing a snake cut into eighths, with each segment labeled with the initials of one of the American colonies or regions. New England was represented as one segment, rather than the four colonies it was at that time. Delaware was not listed separately as it was part of Pennsylvania. Georgia, however, was omitted completely. Thus, it has eight segments of a snake rather than the traditional 13 colonies. The poster focused solely on the colonies that would go-on to make up the present-day United States, due to their shared identities as Americans. The cartoon appeared along with Franklin's editorial about the \\"disunited state\\" of the colonies and helped make his point about the importance of colonial unity. It later became a symbol of colonial freedom during the American Revolutionary War. ==Role during the Seven Years' War == The French and Indian War was a part of the Seven Years' War which pitted Great Britain alongside the Thirteen Colonies and their native allies against the French, New France and their native allies. Many American colonists wished to capture the lands west of the Appalachian Mountains and displace the indigenous population by settling there. During the outbreak of the war, the American colonists were divided on whether or not to take the risk of actually fighting the French for control of the lands west of the Appalachian Mountains. The poster quickly became a symbol for the need of organized action against the threat posed by the French and their native allies during the conflict, as while many Americans were unwilling to participate in combat against the French, many more recognized that if the French colonies were not captured they would always pose a risk to the well-being and security of the Thirteen Colonies. Writer Philip Davidson stated that Franklin was a propagandist influential in seeing the potential in political cartoons to stir up public opinion in favor of a certain way of thinking.Olson, Lester C. Benjamin Franklin's George Washington Vision of American Community. University of South Carolina Press, Columbia, 2004 Franklin had proposed the Albany Plan and his cartoon suggested that such a union was necessary to avoid being each colony being captured individually by the French. As Franklin wrote: ==Role prior to and during the American Revolution== Massachusetts Spy, July 7, 1774 Franklin's political cartoon took on a different meaning during the lead up to the American Revolution, especially around 1765‚Äì1766, during the Stamp Act Congress. American colonists protesting against the rule of the Crown used the cartoon in the Constitutional Courant to help persuade their fellow colonists to rise up. However, the Patriots, who associated the image with eternity, vigilance, and prudence, were not the only ones who saw a new interpretation of the cartoon. The Loyalists saw the cartoon with more biblical traditions, such as those of guile, deceit, and treachery. Franklin himself opposed the use of his cartoon at this time, but instead advocated a moderate political policy; in 1766, he published a new cartoon MAGNA Britannia: her Colonies REDUCED, where he warned against the danger of Britain losing her American colonies by means of the image of a female figure (Britannia) with her limbs cut off. Because of Franklin's initial cartoon, however, the Courant was thought of in England as one of the most radical publications. The difference between the use of Join or Die in 1754 and 1765 is that Franklin had designed it to unite the colonies for 'management of Indian relations' and defense against France, but in 1765 American colonists used it to urge colonial unity in favor of resisting laws and edicts that were imposed upon them. Also during this time the phrase \\"join, or die\\" changed to \\"unite, or die,\\" in some states such as New York and Pennsylvania. Soon after the publication of the cartoon during the Stamp Act Congress, variations were printed in New York, Massachusetts, and a couple of months later it had spread to Virginia and South Carolina. In some states, such as New York and Pennsylvania, the cartoon continued to be published week after week for over a year. On July 7, 1774 Paul Revere altered the cartoon to fit the masthead of the Massachusetts Spy. ==Legacy== The cartoon has been reprinted and redrawn widely throughout American history. Variants of the cartoon have different texts, e.g. \\"Unite or Dead\\", and differently labeled segments, depending on the political bodies being appealed to. During the American Revolutionary War, the image became a potent symbol of the unity displayed by the American colonists and resistance to Parliament and the Crown. It returned to service, suitably redrawn, for both sides of the American Civil War, as both Union and Confederacy held differing views on the nature of the Federal government. * The Latin translation of Join, or Die (Jungite aut Perite) is used as the official motto of the Philadelphia Union soccer team. A snake is also featured in their logo as an allusion to this cartoon. * A flag featuring this cartoon was prominently displayed in the opening credits of the TV miniseries John Adams and was the title for the first part of the miniseries. * The Late Late Show former host Craig Ferguson has this cartoon tattooed on the inside of his right forearm reaching his wrist, to commemorate becoming an American Citizen. Ferguson also named his comedy-talk show on the History Channel, Join or Die with Craig Ferguson, after the cartoon. The show began airing in February 2016. * An image of the Join, or Die snake was delivered as a threat to a victim in the NCIS episode \\"Dead Air\\". It was used as a symbol for a Military At Home terrorist group. * \\"Join Or Die\\" is the name given to the special edition of the video game Assassin's Creed III, which is set during the American Revolutionary War. *In the TNT show Falling Skies, when Pope and his gang of outlaws are cornered at gunpoint by Tom Mason, Pope asks Mason for options, to which Mason replies \\"Join, or Die!\\". Part of Mason's backstory included him being a Boston University history professor who taught the American Revolution as part of his curriculum. *On the Fox show Sleepy Hollow in the episode \\"Magnum Opus\\" in Season 2 Episode 10, the original Join or Die cartoon is shown and described as being drawn by Benjamin Franklin to secretly indicate an actual river. Looking at the actual map, the place where the mouth of the snake is located is where the main characters find an enchanted sword. *The Philadelphia 76ers NBA team integrated the snake into its Liberty Bell logo to create a special edition 2018 playoffs logo, though it used the later alternate version, \\"Unite or Die.\\" *All throughout the game Fallout 4 these posters can be found in buildings with no real context. *In the film, In the Shadow of the Moon (2019), a miniature flag printed with the snake is seen next to the flag of the militant terrorist group, in one of the final scenes. ==See also== *Gadsden Flag ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Copeland, David.

They were slender birds with long, thin legs and a long neck. Little is known about the shape of their skull or beak. Some paleontologists think Palaelodus was able to swim under water, chasing prey, but the morphology of their feet seems not very well adapted for diving. Rather, it is more likely that they were adapted to browsing for food while swimming or standing in shallow water. The family, Palaelodidae, is the sister taxon of modern flamingos, and the order Phoenicopteriformes, to which both belong, probably evolved from a grebe-like ancestor. It is easy to see how a bird like Palaelodus represents an intermediate form between a diving, fish-eating grebe and a wading, invertebrate-filtering flamingo. This does not mean that the palaelodids are the ancestors of the flamingos. Rather, they were a sister group that remained in the ecological niche of their common ancestor. ==Species== Tibiotarsi of Grus cubensis, Propelargus edwardsi, and Palaelodus gracilipes at the Museum f√ºr Naturkunde, Berlin The number of species in the genus is disputed. The species P. ambiguus was found in Middle Oligocene to Middle Miocene (c. 29-12 mya) deposits of Western and Central Europe, being rare in Oligocene and much more common in Miocene strata; there is also a probably record from the Oligocene/Miocene of Taubat√© Basin in S√£o Paulo, Brazil. The Romanian fossil Grus miocaenicus is sometimes considered a synonym of this species. Other, somewhat doubtful species described from the Late Oligocene to Early Miocene (c. 28-23 mya) of French inland sites are P. gracilipes and P. crassipes which are most common in the Late Oligocene and later are replaced by P. ambiguus. From Late Oligocene to Middle Miocene (c. 28-12 mya) sites in Australia, two species, P. pledgei and P. wilsoni have been described. The latter was also claimed from Middle Pleistocene deposits (roughly half a million years ago) in Australia; given the large temporal gap, it might not belong to the genus. P. pledgei was described from fossil material (a proximal right tarsometatarsus and a distal right tibiotarsus) collected from Lake Palankarinna in the Lake Eyre Basin in north-eastern South Australia. P. wilsoni was described from several leg bones collected from Lake Palankarinna as well, and both were described in the same 1998 paper. P. aotearoa is from the Early Miocene of New Zealand. Two distal right tibiotarsi collected in 2008 and 2009 from the Saint Bathans Fauna of the Bannockburn Formation, Manuherikia River, in central Otago, South Island were described in 2010 as the type specimens of the species.

He also held the viscounties of Marsan, Castelbon, N√©bouzan, Villemeur and Lautrec and was, by virtue of the county of Foix, co- prince of Andorra. From 1447 he was also Viscount of Narbonne. Through his marriage to Eleonor, heiress of the Kingdom of Navarre, he also held the title of Prince of Navarre. He was a son of John I, Count of Foix and Jeanne d'Albret. His maternal grandparents were Charles d'Albret, Constable of France and co-commander of the French army, killed at the Battle of Agincourt, and his wife Marie de Sully. Gaston married the Navarrese Infanta, Eleonor, in 1436. Her parents were John II of Aragon and Blanche I of Navarre. At the time, Leonor appeared to have few prospects: her father was a younger son and brother of kings of Aragon, and Leonor had a brother, Charles of Viana, and an older sister, Blanca, standing between herself and the throne of Navarre. However, family dissent and death eliminated both Charles and Blanca; Leonor's father usurped the Navarrese crown, to which he added in 1458 the throne of Aragon (his older brother having died without legitimate children) and, following the deaths of Charles and Blanca, promised the succession to Navarre to Leonor and her husband in return for their loyalty to him, which was given. They had ten children: * Gaston de Foix (1443-1470), (sometimes called ‚ÄúGaston V of Foix‚Äù), Viscount of Castelbon, Prince of Viana (1462-1470), lieutenant general of Navarre (1469). * Jean de Foix (1446-1500), Viscount of Narbonne (1468-1500), Count d'√âtampes (1478-1500). He claimed the throne of Navarre upon the death of his nephew Fran√ßois Ph√©bus. He married in 1476 Marie of Orleans (1457-1493), sister of the future King of France Louis XII. * Marguerite de Foix (1449-1486), married at Clisson on 27 June 1471 Francis II, Duke of Brittany. They were parents of Anne of Brittany, twice queen of France as consort to both Charles VIII and Louis XII. * Pierre de Foix (7 February 1449 to 10 August 1490), (sometimes called ‚ÄúPierre II of Foix‚Äù), called Pierre the Young, cardinal (1576), viceroy of Navarre (1479-1484) * Marie de Foix (c.1452-1467), married Guglielmo VIII, Marquis of Montferrat, son of Giangiacomo of Montferrat and his wife Jeanne de Savoie * Jeanne de Foix (c.1454-c.1476), married in August 1469 in Lectoure, to Jean V of Armagnac (1420-1473). * Catherine de Foix (c.1460-before 1494), married in 1469 Gaston de Foix, Count of Candale (c.1440-1500), (sometimes called ‚ÄúGaston II of Foix‚Äù). * Isabel de Foix (after 1462). * Leonor de Foix (after 1466 - died young). * Jacques de Foix, Infante de Navarra (1469-in France 1500), Count de Montfort. Married in 1485 and divorced in 1494 Ana de Peralta, daughter of Pedro de Peralta, 1st Count de Santisteban y Ler√≠n and his second wife Isabelle de Grailly. Married secondly in 1495 Catherine de Beaumont, daughter of Louis de Beaumont, 2nd Count de Ler√≠n and his wife Leonor de Arag√≥n. Jacques and his second wife had one child: Jean de Foix, abbot of Saint- Volusien-de-Foix. Jacques also had two illegitimate children by unknown mistresses: Frederic de Foix (-1537), Seigneur d'Almen√®ches, and Jacques de Foix (-7 Apr 1535), Bishop of Oloron and Lescar. ==ReferencesSources== * * * ==Further reading== *Courteault, Henri.

It is generally broadcast between approximately 11pm on 31 December and between 1am and 2am the following morning in the United Kingdom on BBC Two. The advance-recorded show features a Hogmanay party atmosphere with all the guests (drawn from across the world of showbusiness) and other guest audience members present, and the artists themselves getting involved alongside a variety of musical acts by the artists from various genres who perform both before and after midnight. There is a countdown to the midnight start of the New Year, followed by a traditional rendition of \\"Auld Lang Syne\\", often with the Pipes and Drums of the Scots Guards. Among the regular events of the evening is the spot where Holland asks actor and comedian Rowland Rivron his predictions for the year ahead/his New Year's resolutions. Editions also feature a white-suited man with a clock for a face named Father Time or Clockman. == Production == The show is pre-recorded, but is presented as if live, with a countdown to midnight and references to the new calendar year. Artists appearing on the programme while performing live at New Year celebrations elsewhere, and guests mentioning New Year's Eve instead of New Year's Day after the pre-recorded countdown, have led viewers to complain that they were deceived. The BBC has described the show as \\"an idealised New Year's Eve party with a line-up that would surely be impossible to deliver on 31 December\\". == 2006/07 edition == Acts that appeared in 2006/07 included the Zutons and Seasick Steve. Comedian Adrian Edmondson, a regular on the show, was joined by Jools and his band to perform a swing version of the Sex Pistols song \\"Anarchy in the U.K.\\" Also appearing on the show was Amy Winehouse collaborating with Paul Weller on two tracks, \\"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\\" and \\"Don't Go to Strangers\\", originally recorded by Etta Jones. Kate Rusby sang \\"Fare Thee Well\\" as midnight struck, accompanied by the 1st Battalion Scots Guards. == 2007/08 edition ==  Artists who performed on the 2007/08 show  { style=\\"width:100%;

Earth System History. p. 175 Though it was not the final major transgression, it was the last complete sequence to cover the North American craton; the following Tejas sequence was much less extensive. ==Cause and progression== Like other sequences, the Zu√±i was probably caused by a mantle plume - more specifically, the Mid-Cretaceous Superplume event. A mass of unusually hot rock rose from the lower mantle to the base of the lithosphere, fueling a dramatic increase in seafloor spreading rates; this caused the hotter mid-ocean ridges to increase in volume, thus displacing the oceans onto the continents.Larson, Roger L. \\"The Mid-Cretaceous Superplume Episode\\". Scientific American Special: Our Ever Changing Earth. p. 26 Sea level rose in earnest beginning in the early Cretaceous, until by Cenomanian time it was roughly 250 metres (800+ feet) higher than today.Larson, pp. 25-6 This was the time of the great Western Interior Seaway and the widespread continental deposition of carbonates and shale elsewhere.Stanley, pp. 479-80 There were also intervals where black shale accumulated in abundance on the continents, indicative of a stagnant water column; apparently water in the polar oceans was too warm to sink and oxygenate the deep-sea, as it does today.Stanley, p. 480 Many of these black shales are now rich in petroleum sources. The waters of the Zu√±i sequence began to subside late in the Cretaceous period, and by the early Cenozoic a new craton-wide unconformity in North America indicates a complete regression before the Tejas sequence of the late Paleogene.Stanley, p. 175 ==See also== *Ontong-Java Plateau *Sequence stratigraphy ==FootnotesReferences== *Larson, Roger L. \\"The Mid-Cretaceous Superplume Episode\\".

Most of the programs are members of the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference (MAAC) and classified as Division I-AAA in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). The men's and women's golf programs are both ranked among the best in the nation for academics, according to Golf Digest. ==Traditions== History of the Stag With the dawn of the first athletic team (cross country) in the fall of 1947, it became apparent that a nickname would be needed. For the 1947-48 season, Fairfield University adopted the \\"Men In Red\\" as its nickname. The following year, the University introduced men's basketball as its next team and its first varsity sport. With the start of varsity sports, the school put it to the students for input in naming of a school mascot. Two recommendations were made to the Board of Trustees for an official decision and vote. As the late Fr. Charles F. Duffy S.J. recounted: \\"As a member of the Board of Trustees, I remember voting at a board meeting late in 1948 on the naming for our athletic teams. We voted for Stags over Chanticleers!\\" What made the decision for the Board a bit easier and logical was the fact that the school was part of the Dioceses of Hartford and the word Hartford means stags (hart) and stream (ford). According to Webster's New World Dictionary the word \\"hart\\" means \\"A male of the European red deer; stag.\\" As for the world \\"ford\\" Webster describes it as \\"A shallow place in a stream, river, etc.\\" As a result, Fairfield University's seal itself was designed featuring a deer leaping over a tumbling brook to represent both the school's connection with the Dioceses as well with its close ties with nature. Fairfield is situated on a rolling, immensely wooded campus overlooking Long Island Sound. The name fits well as a nickname because the Stag is a good jumper and it spirited and agile, as Fairfield would like all of its student-athletes to be. == Sports sponsored == { style=\\"float:right; clear:right; margin:0 0 1em 1em;\\" - -  Baseball  Basketball -  Basketball  Cross country -  Cross country  Field hockey -  Lacrosse  Golf -  Rowing  Lacrosse -  Soccer  Rowing -  Swimming and diving  Soccer -  Tennis  Softball -   Swimming and diving -   Tennis -   Volleyball }  Baseball  Alumni Baseball Diamond The Fairfield Stags men's baseball team competes in the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference of NCAA Division I and plays their home games at the Alumni Baseball Diamond on the campus of Fairfield University.

The following year the Colombia Football Federation hired him to manage the national team's youth squad and then was quickly promoted to manage the Senior Squad to compete in the 1987 Copa Am√©rica where they reached third place by beating the host Argentina. During this time, he was also hired to manage his former team Atl√©tico Nacional. Then in 1989 he had his most successful year in his career. He led Atl√©tico Nacional, composed of many Colombian legends, to win the Copa Libertadores for the first time for any Colombian club. Using Atl√©tico Nacional players as a base for the National Team, he qualified the team to the 1990 World Cup after 28 years of absence.

In 1993, he got Colombia qualified for a second time in a row to a World Cup, with a historic triumph over Argentina in Buenos Aires by 5‚Äì0. That score made Colombia a surprising favorite for the 1994 World Cup, but the performance there was disappointing, as the team was eliminated in the first round, being defeated by United States and Romania, although it was understood that the team's make-up had been heavily influenced by rampant threats from the cartel groups at the time.

The two known species were described after fossils from the Early Eocene Green River Formation (c.49 million years ago) of Wyoming. A number of good complete and partial skeletons, some with feather impressions, are known of the type species, Limnofregata azygosternon, and L. hasegawai is known from two skulls and most of one torso. == Description== Birds of the genus Limnofregata resembled modern frigatebirds, but had shorter less-hooked bills and longer legs, and longer slitlike nasal openings. They stood tall when on the ground and had a wingspan of about . The beak was shorter than that of modern frigatebirds, and lacked the typical hook at the end, resembling a strong booby beak more than that of today's frigatebirds. The species differ conspicuously in size, with L. hasegawai being as much larger when compared to L. azygosternon as today's largest species of frigatebird (Fregata magnificens) is compared to the smallest extant one (Fregata ariel). The bill of L. hasegawai was notably larger still than that of its congener, whereas its feet were smaller, echoing a pattern found in the extant Fregata species. In 2014, a third species, Limnofregata hutchisoni, was described from the Wasatch Formation, 2 million years older than the Green River Formation. Though the only remains are a coracoid and a humerus, these bones clearly identify it as part of the genus. It is of comparable size to F. magnificens. It is at least 53 and possibly 54 or 55 million years old. The fossil beds have remains of crocodiles, large trionychid turtles and fish, indicating a sizeable body of water. == Paleobiology == Skull of L. hasegawai in the Field Museum. The Eocene frigatebird genus Limnofregata comprises birds whose fossil remains were recovered from prehistoric freshwater environments, unlike the marine preferences of their modern-day relatives. They are thought to have lived like gulls of the genus Larus. They inhabited the freshwater or brackish lakes that in time formed in today's Green River valley due to the uplift of the Rocky Mountains, feeding on smaller vertebrates and probably harassing other shorebirds for food and feasting on dead fish (e.g. Knightia) during summer dieoffs due to oxygen depletion in the eutrophic lakes. Modern frigatebirds show pronounced sexual dimorphism in size, apparently to avoid competition due to different soaring behavior of male and female wings. As Limnofregata was most likely not a soaring bird, it can be expected that the sexes were much alike. It is not known if the males had a prominent throat balloon for advertising for mates as in their modern relatives, but Limnofregata throat bones differ markedly from those of modern frigatebirds. ==References== * Olson, Storrs L. & Matsuoka, Hiroshige (2005): New specimens of the early Eocene frigatebird Limnofregata (Pelecaniformes: Fregatidae), with the description of a new species.

It is also known for its many ghost sightings ==History== In December 2004, this station was opened before work was even finished on the line running along the Avenida Ciudad de Cali. It was the fifth terminus of the system to be opened. At first, only red buses of the size of the feeder buses were used at this station. They bore signs reading P.A. or PORTAL AMERICAS but did not have a formal route number. In March 2004, after the Biblioteca Tintal and Patio Bonito stations were opened, the station began normal operations on one of its three platforms. ==Station services==  Old trunk services  {  +Services rendered until April 29, 2006 - !

It was published in 1961 and won the Miles Franklin Award that year. It also won the 1965 Gold Medal of the Australian Literature Society.Powell's Books ‚Äì Riders in the Chariot by Patrick White The novel is the story of the lives of four loosely connected people, whose common link is the mystic experience of the chariot of the title described in the Book of Ezekiel, and traces their lives towards the point where they realise they share the same vision. The novel combines literature, mysticism and suburban life in 1950s Australia to show the ignorance and prejudice of the everyday people in reaction to the few who see the infinite, snowballing with catastrophic consequencesNational Library of Australia, Vol 7 2007 Riders in the Chariot: A Tale for our Times, Bernadette Brennan ==Plot summary== The book begins with an epigraph from The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, in which William Blake imagines a conversation with the prophets Isaiah and Ezekiel. Asked how he could dare to claim that God had spoken to him, Isaiah says he came to sense the infinite in everything and concluded that the voice of honest indignation was itself the voice of God. Ezekiel says that the work of a prophet is to raise other men into a perception of the infinite.  Part I  In the years after World War II, Mary Hare lives on the outskirts of suburban Sarsaparilla. While possessed with a deep love of nature and animals, she is socially awkward and ostracised from the community, who regard her as an eccentric. Flashbacks to her childhood show her abuse and torment at the hands of her father, a Sydney wine merchant who married above his station and arrogantly squandered his wife‚Äôs fortune on the construction of Xanadu, the crumbling estate where Mary now lives. Her distant cousin Eustace Cleugh, who once visited Xanadu but responded to Mary‚Äôs childhood infatuation with disdain, has recently resumed financially supporting her after a long absence during the war. She was once nursed back to health from a serious illness by Ruth Godbold, during which she had visions of a fiery chariot; Mary inwardly believes Ruth shares the same vision. With her new means, Mary hires Mrs Jolley to keep house for her. Jolley is outwardly religious but is soon revealed to be a callous, judgemental woman. The pair quickly develop a mutual fear and hostility of one another as Jolley strikes up a friendship with Mrs Flack, a kindred spirit and the town gossip who lives on her own in Sarsaparilla. Seeking refuge from the poisonous atmosphere of Xanadu, Mary takes refuge in the scrubland around the estate and encounters the elderly Mordecai Himmelfarb.  Part II  Mordecai shares his life story with Mary as the pair bond under a tree. Born in the 1880s to a wealthy Jewish merchant family in Germany, Mordecai‚Äôs early childhood was tinged with the faint awareness of the pogroms underway in eastern Europe at the time. He grows into an exceptional scholar and studies at Oxford, where a brief affair with the daughter of an English nobleman leaves him heartbroken. Soon before returning home to fight for Germany in World War I, his mother sends a letter to tell him that her father has renounced Judaism; relatives later blame her death on this decision. Mordecai wins a medal for his wartime service, marries and is later appointed to an English professorship in a small town. The rise of the Third Reich sees his expulsion from university and his wife is taken away during Kristallnacht, never to be seen by Mordecai again. When the liberal couple sheltering him are taken away, Mordecai presents himself at a police station and is taken to a concentration camp by train. Many of his fellow passengers die on the journey. Mordecai is spared immediate extermination on arrival and escapes after a camp uprising. He is later helped to Palestine, where after a brief reunion with his brother-in-law, he impulsively announces his intention to settle in Australia.  Part III  Soon after his arrival in Sydney, Mordecai takes a metalworking job at Brighta Bicycle Lamps in Barranugli. He recognises that his employer Harry Rosetree is also a German Jew, but his overtures are sternly rebuffed by the factory owner, whose family are shown to be doing their best to assimilate to middle-class Australian society. Mrs Flack begins to spread malicious and unfounded gossip about Mordecai which she relays to Blue, another worker at the factory who she introduces to Mrs Jolley as her nephew. Mordecai accidentally injures his hand with a drill while at work one day and is tended to by his next-door neighbour, Ruth Godbold.  Part IV  Ruth is an impoverished and deeply religious woman supporting six young children by taking in laundry from other households. As a child she emigrates to Sydney from Britain after a farming accident kills her brother, and later works as a domestic servant in the household of wealthy socialite Jinny Chalmers-Robinson. She moves to Sarsaparilla with Tom, later revealed to be an abusive and philandering alcoholic. Their marriage comes to an end after she confronts him at a brothel where she also encounters and shows kindness to Alf Dubbo, an Aboriginal man who is treated abusively by the others present.  Part V  Mrs Jolley tells Mary she is terminating her service to live with Mrs Flack, and reveals the depths of her own bigotry by scorning Mary‚Äôs friendship with the Mordecai. The depths of Mordecai‚Äôs ostracism from the rest of the Brighta factory workforce are shown. In the factory bathroom, Mordecai finds a copy of the Bible open to the description of the chariot in the Book of Ezekiel. Alf, employed as a cleaner at the factory, comes in to reclaim his book and the men share a terse introduction. Despite Alf‚Äôs reticence to open up to Mordecai, both men individually recognise they share a deep spiritual connection over the chariot. Alf‚Äôs early life is recounted, including his abduction from his mother and childhood in the home of the Anglican clergyman Timothy Calderon, whose sister encourages his nascent gift for painting. Alf runs away as a teenager after Calderon‚Äôs sister catches both men having sex. Arriving in Sydney, he sublets a room from the prostitute Hannah, where he lives a reclusive existence honing his artistic talents by painting scenes of the Gospels. When Hannah steals some of his paintings and sells them, claiming to be helping his financial situation, he is deeply hurt by the betrayal and immediately leaves, later taking a room in Barranugli to work at the bicycle lamp factory.  Part VI  In the present day, Easter is looming. Sensing trouble, Rosetree quietly offers Himmelfarb the opportunity to stay at home during Passover. Mordecai also has a sense that there is a conspiracy against him, but he nonetheless returns to the factory on the day before Good Friday. Blue and his friends at the factory win a lottery syndicate and spend the morning drinking at a pub across the road. Wandering through the factory drunk, Blue is overcome by the sense of Mordecai‚Äôs otherness and reminded of Mrs Flack's mention of the Jewish deicide. Mordecai is seized and subjected to a mock crucifixion on a jacaranda tree outside the factory. Alf refuses to intervene and denies any association with Mordecai. At the same time, Mary Hare walks through Xanadu as a crack appears in the marble structure of her home, and she intuits that her friend is being killed. Rosetree at first fails to intervene but eventually instructs the foreman to end the spectacle. Himmelfarb is cut down, but it later becomes clear he is mortally wounded. His wounds are tended to in the shed which Ruth‚Äôs family lives, with the assistance of Mary, as his own home is set alight and destroyed. Alf watches the trio from outside but leaves before his own presence is discovered, and Mordecai succumbs to his injuries. Overcome by guilt over Mordecai's death, Rosetree hangs himself in his bathroom. Alf stays in his room and works for days on end to paint the scene he witnessed at Ruth‚Äôs house, which he incorporates into his picture of Ezekiel‚Äôs vision of the chariot. Soon after he finishes, he is found dead by his landlady; the painting is auctioned off in an estate sale and its present whereabouts, or even whether it survived, is unknown.  Part VII  Years later, Xanadu is demolished and sold off by an agent of the beneficiary of Mary‚Äôs will, Eustace Cleugh. The land is subdivided for Sydney‚Äôs expanding suburban fringe. Mary is presumed dead after leaving Sarsaparilla the night of Mordecai‚Äôs death, but her body has never been found. Mrs Jolley discovers that Blue is actually Mrs Flack‚Äôs son, born out of wedlock. Separately, Mrs Jolley‚Äôs children are revealed to believe her responsible for the death of her husband, preventing her return to Melbourne ‚Äî a fact Mrs Flack discovers snooping through Mrs Jolley‚Äôs letters. Both are condemned to live together in an environment of mutual fear, wary of the power each wields over the other. Rosetree‚Äôs wife Shirl, since remarried, is invited to a society lunch with Ruth‚Äôs former employer Jinny and another woman. The trio debate whether what occurred at Sarsaparilla was a miracle, and Shirl loses her composure after recalling Harry's suicide. Ruth watches her eldest daughter Else with her new partner Bob Tanner ‚Äî both of whom helped tend to Mordecai ‚Äî and realises that he will treat Else with the love and respect that she never knew in her own marriage. Walking past the land that was once Xanadu one day, she is overcome by the memory of Mordecai‚Äôs death. On future walks along the same route, she averts her eyes. ==Characters== The main four characters are outsiders with deeply different lives made more difficult because they are religious visionaries. Each experience the same vision of four horses drawing a chariot into a shining future: the fiery chariot from the Book of Ezekiel in the Hebrew bible; visions that make them vulnerable to ‚Äì and affect the way they deal with ‚Äì the wily plotting of others.The New York Review of Books Mary Hare - an eccentric and troubled heiress born into a reputable family of early Australian settlers, now living in a decaying estate on the outskirts of Sarsaparilla. Dismissed as mad by most of the townsfolk, she nonetheless perceives with great clarity the events that will lead to the novel‚Äôs climax. Mordecai Himmelfarb - A German Jew who leads a distinguished if provincial career as an English professor after decorated service in World War I, until the rising tide of anti-Semitism that accompanies the Third Reich robs him of his wife. He survives the Holocaust and settles in Sydney, taking a job in a machine shop. Ruth Godbold - A devoutly religious woman with a large brood of young children who emigrates to Australia from England after a family tragedy. She briefly enters domestic service before an ill-considered marriage to a tradesman who treats her abusively. Alf Dubbo - A half- Aboriginal member of the Stolen Generations who grows up in the care of a pastor who later sexually abuses him. He flees to Sydney where his artistic impulses are tempered by his mistrust of others and a self-destructive lifestyle. Mrs Jolley - Mary Hare‚Äôs housekeeper, who treats her employer with cruel contempt and later leaves to take up residence with Mrs Flack. Mrs Flack - A mean-spirited woman who helps precipitate the events that culminate with the attack on Himmelfarb. Timothy Calderon - A clergyman who raises Alf Dubbo and later sexually abuses him. Jinny Chalmers-Robinson - A wealthy Sydney socialite with a distant relationship to her husband who briefly employs Ruth Godbold in domestic service. Eustace Cleugh - Mary Hare‚Äôs distant cousin, the object of her childhood infatuations and later her modest benefactor. Konrad and Ingeborg Stauffer - A liberal couple who shelter Himmelfarb as the Nazi regime‚Äôs anti-Semitic policies gradually reach their zenith with the Holocaust. Both are later arrested and presumably executed. Mollie Khalil - The owner of an illegal brothel in Sarsaparilla, where Ruth Godbold confronts her abusive husband. Harry Rosetree - aka Haim Rosenbaum. The owner of the Brighta Bicycle Lamps factory which employs Dubbo and Himmelfarb. Shirl Rosetree - aka Shulamith Rosenbaum. The wife of Harry, who has pushed her husband and raised her children in line with the assimilationist policies of postwar Australia. == Setting == Most of the narrative is set in Sarsaparilla, the fictional stand-in for the Sydney suburb of Castle Hill, where White lived with his partner Manoly Lascaris after returning to Australia. Himmelfarb and Dubbo work at a factory in nearby Barranguli, a fictionalised version of Baulkam Hills. The area is today colloquially known as Sydney‚Äôs ‚ÄúBible belt‚Äù. == Religious symbolism == The primary form of symbolism within the book is through the chariot (or merkabah) as described in the Book of Ezekiel, a vehicle for God's chosen ones.Why bother with Patrick White? The novel contains several narrative references to the Gospels. As Dubbo watches Mary Hare and Ruth Godbold tend to a dying Himmelfarb, he perceives them as Mary Magdalene and Mary, Mother of Jesus. Mary Hare‚Äôs own disappearance shortly afterwards is reminiscent of the Assumption of Mary. Dubbo‚Äôs denial of Himmelfarb as the latter is strung up at the factory mirrors Peter‚Äôs denial of Jesus, while Harry Rosetree‚Äôs last day loosely echoes the betrayal and suicide of Judas. == Reception == Riders in the Chariot was singled out for praise by the Nobel Prize in Literature committee when White was named a laureate in 1973. The panel described it as \\"a sacrificial drama, tense, yet with an everyday setting, in the midst of current Australian reality.\\" The novel won the Miles Franklin Award in 1961. White had earlier won Australia‚Äôs chief literary prize in its inaugural year for Voss. ==References== Category:Novels by Patrick White Category:1961 Australian novels Category:Miles Franklin Award-winning works Category:Novels set in Sydney Category:Eyre & Spottiswoode books ","title":"Riders in the Chariot"},{"id":"5604549","text":"Simon James Greenall (born 3 January 1958) is an English actor, writer, producer and voice artist.

Extracts from the Statute of Merton. The Statute of Merton or Provisions of Merton (Latin: Provisiones de Merton, or Stat. Merton), sometimes also known as the Ancient Statute of Merton, was a statute passed by the Parliament of England in 1235 during the reign of Henry III. It is considered to be the first English statute, and is printed as the first statute in The Statutes of the Realm. Containing 11 chapters, the terms of the statute were agreed at Merton between HenryMerton's New Religious House Consecrated and the barons of England in 1235. It was another instance, along with Magna Carta twenty years previously, of the struggle between the barons and the king to limit the latter's rights. Amongst its provisions, the statute allowed a Lord of the Manor to enclose common land provided that sufficient pasture remained for his tenants, and set out when and how manorial lords could assert rights over waste land, woods, and pastures against their tenants.Journals of the House of Commons (1803 reprint) Volume 27, page 574, originally published 1756 It quickly became a basis for English common law, developing and clarifying legal concepts of ownership, and was one of the English statutes carried over into the law of the Lordship of Ireland. Having long been disused, it was revived under Duke of Northumberland John Dudley in January 1550 to enable lords to enclose their land at their own discretion, out of keeping with the traditional Tudor anti- enclosure attitude. The Statute also dealt with illegitimacy1788 - Before European Settlement ‚Äî stating that \\"He is a bastard that is born before the marriage of his parents\\". It also dealt with women's rights ‚Äî dowries (\\"A woman shall recover damages in a writ of dower\\"), and widows' right to bequeath land (\\"Widows may bequeath the crop of their lands\\").https://msa.maryland.gov/megafile/msa/speccol/sc2900/sc2908/000001/000143/html/am143 --262.html Chapter 4 of this statute was the Commons Act 1236. Chapters 1 and 2 and 9 were repealed for the Republic of Ireland by section 8 of, and Part I of Schedule 2 to, the Succession Act, 1965, subject to the savings in section 9 of that Act. The whole statute was repealed for that Republic by section 1 of, and Part 2 of the Schedule to, the Statute Law Revision Act 1983. ==Dating and nomenclature== The statute was passed in 1235 and is named for Merton where it was passed. It is considered the first English statute. Magna Carta was initially enacted in 1215 and is counted as a statute by some sources as early as 1225; however, The Statutes of the Realm does not consider it as a statute prior to a 1297 confirmation. The Charter of the Forest had been passed in 1217 but is not considered a statute. == Extracts == * A woman shall recover damages in a writ of dower. * Widows may bequeath the crop of their lands. * He is a bastard that is born before the marriage of his parents. == See also == * List of English statutes * Henry de Bracton == Notes References  External links == * List of repeals in the Republic of Ireland from the Irish Statute Book.

After a wave of arson ravaged the low-income communities of New York City throughout the 1970s, many if not most residential structures in Morris Heights were left seriously damaged or destroyed. The city began to rehabilitate many formerly abandoned tenement- style apartment buildings and designate them low-income housing beginning in the late 1970s. Also, many subsidized attached multi-unit townhouses and newly constructed apartment buildings have been or are being built on vacant lots across the neighborhood. 1520 Sedgwick Avenue, considered the birthplace of hip hop Morris Heights is believed to be the site where Hip Hop culture originated in the 1970s.

Juanita was the first ballad by a woman composer to achieve massive sales, and its original setting (for a soprano) has been seen to be subtly subversive of gender roles (as the woman singing the song is taking the part of the wooing lover), a topic of some significance to Mrs. Norton. As composing was seen as a masculine occupation, it was typical to borrow or adapt the melodies. The opening four-bar phrase of the song is taken from Handel's aria Lascia ch'io pianga from the opera Rinaldo, although the subsequent melody differs from that of the aria. The name of the song is derived from the refrains: \\"Juanita\\" appears in numerous songbooks and has been recorded many times. Early successes were by Frank C. Stanley (1905) and by Emilio de Gogorza in 1919. The song was included in the Jo Stafford and Gordon MacRae album Memory Songs (1955). A crowd of picnickers sings the song, near the 41-minute mark in Picnic (1955 film). Jim Reeves included the song (as 'My Juanita') in his album Girls I Have Known (1958) and Bing Crosby featured the song in a medley on his album 101 Gang Songs (1961). ==References== Bibliography *Metropolitan Quartette (1909). \\"Juanita\\" mp3.

Barkan Industrial Area) is located about 25 kilometres east of Tel Aviv in the West Bank. Its offices are located at the northern entrance. The industrial park is located adjacent to the Israeli settlement Barkan and near the settlement and city of Ariel. A January 2016 report by Human Rights Watch called for companies to pull out from the West Bank since the study says that these companies, including Barkan Industrial Park, violate international law by harming the rights of the Palestinians.Karl Vick, 'Why Human Rights Watch Is Urging Companies to Pull Out of Israeli Settlements,' Time Magazine 19 January 2016.'Occupation, Inc. How Settlement Businesses Contribute to Israel‚Äôs Violations of Palestinian Rights,' Human Rights Watch 19 January 2016. However, others contend that the industrial zone is a major source of employment for Palestinian workers. The international community considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank illegal under international law, but the Israeli government disputes this. ==Pollution== It is reported that many highly polluting factories from Israel moved into settlement industrial zones like Barkan to profit from the relative lack of environmental regulations there.Eric Reidy, 'Palestinians thirst for water treatment plant,' Al Jazeera 21 December 2013. In 1998 Barkan factories generated each year an estimated 810,000 cubic meters of industrial wastewater, which flowed untreated from the 3 storage tanks, after a design defect, made them nonoperational when overloaded, into a nearby wadi into the agricultural lands of the Palestinian villages of Sarta, Kafr ad-Dik and Bruqin, and reportedly polluting the groundwater with heavy metals. According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health roughly 70% of cancers among Palestinians in the contiguous Salfit Governorate occur among people living near the industrial park and exposed to the waste overflow.Charmaine Seitz,'Palestinian women face political and social frustrations,' Unicef 23 September 2011.Kenneth Ring, Ghassan Abdullah, Letters from Palestine: Palestinians Speak Out about Their Lives, Their Country, and the Power of Nonviolence, Wheatmark, Inc., 2010 pp.67-8. ==History== Founded in 1982, in order to strengthen the Jewish presence in the West Bank, the industrial park currently includes about 120 businesses and factories manufacturing plastics, metal-work, food, textile, and more, with a workforce of 20,000, half of whom are Palestinians. According to Suleiman Shamlawi, from the nearby village of Haris, large parts of the Barkan industrial plant are built over 215 dunams (22 hectares) of land belonging to his family, which the IDF confiscated in 1981 on the grounds it was not registered as private property in 1967. Shamlawi states that, while this is true, records of his tax payments to the Jordanian authorities prove that the family paid its taxes on the land to the Jordanian governing authority down to 1967. The case was argued before the Supreme Court of Israel which ruled that the Shamlawi family had proven its ownership, and was entitled to register its land with Israel. In 2006, a settler organization produced a contract of sale dating back to 1963 claiming it showed that the family another Palestinian had purchased the terrain from the Shamlawi, and that it was later resold to settlers, a sale document the Shamlawi dismiss as a forgery. the property to Israel‚Äôs Supreme Court held that Suleiman had sufficiently proved his ownership and could register the land with the Israeli authorities. In 2007, the Israeli Military's Committee for Initial Land Registration rejected the settler's claim that they could register it in their title as lacking credibility, but then confiscated 170 dunams of the Shamlawi land on which Barkan industrial plants had already been constructed. In 2014, in partial recognition of the Shamlawi claims, Israel ruled that 42 dunams of the Barkan industrial estate not yet built on could be registered in Suleiman Shal√πmlawi's name. ==Israeli-Palestinian conflict== The Israeli government subsidizes companies setting up in West Bank industrial zones, where the rent and tax rates are much lower than in Israel. A minimal initial investment benefit is passed on to such businesses, together with a package of benefits that favour settlement industrial zones. In Barkan (2012) rent averaged 24/ 27 shekels per square metre, as opposed to the Israeli rate of 43 shekels in industrial zones in Caesarea and Rosh Ha‚ÄôAyin, and the rates on Barkan land amount to 47 shekels per square meter, compared to 100 shekels in Rosh Ha‚ÄôAyin. At Barkan Industrial Park thousands of Israelis and Palestinians work in many of the factories. Numerous Israeli authorities have stated that Barkan is a showcase example of the benefits of Israeli- Palestinian cooperation. According to the settlers own council: the good relationships are evident from the fact in all the years since the beginning of the First Intifada, Barkan operated completely undisturbed. Former Samaria Regional Council head Gershon Mesika said - : > \\"It's amazing how the radical Left fails to understand that the main victims > are the Palestinians themselves... Fortunately, so far these boycotts have > been nothing but PR maneuvers, and we are sure that Jews and Arabs will > continue to work together and strengthen our prosperous industry and live in > coexistence\\" Human Rights Watch says that such 'rosey sentiments ignore the deeply discriminatory environment in which settlement businesses operate, and Palestinian workers‚Äô vulnerability to abuse.' Israel's Barkan entrepreneurs hail the arrangement as contributing to the Palestinian economy, while numerous reports from Israeli and Palestinian NGOS and trade unions cite workers' testimonies claiming that labour rights abuse and exploitive practices exist. The Situation of Workers of the Occupied Arab Territories, International Labour Organization, Geneva 2010 p.20-21 Barkan's own website asserts that one of the functions of its industrial development is to enable further Israeli immigration into the occupied Palestinian territories. Palestinian workers are said to start on a minimum wage but can rise to earn more than three times the average salary in areas governed by the Palestinian Authority.Jodi Rudoren, 'In West Bank Settlements, Israeli Jobs Are Double- Edged Sword ,' The New York Times 10 February 2014.Asher Schechter, 'EU settlement ban casts shadow over Palestinian industry in the West Bank,' Haaretz 11 August 2013 Though factories generally comply with the 2007 Israeli Supreme Court ruling that required employers to provide the same salaries, benefits and conditions to all employees, Palestinians as well as Israelis. At smaller factories, abuses have been reported. According to Kav LaOved, an Israeli workers' right organization, Palestinian workers in the Barkan Industrial zone (2009) receive salaries that are less than a third of that established as Israel‚Äôs minimum wage, and they do not receive pay slips, vacations, sick pay, overtime and convalescence payments. In addition Kav LaOved claims most workers earn from $2 to $4 per hour compared with $5.75 for Israelis. An article published on Al-Hayat Al-Jadida, the Palestinian Authority's official daily, praises Israeli treatment of Palestinian workers. With having added benefits such as transportation, medical and pensions, Palestinians are quick to leave their Palestinian employees and work for Israelis, whenever they have the opportunity to do so. Safety rules are enforced strictly by Israeli Workers' Union and physical examinations are done by doctors.http://www.alhayat-j.com/sooq/HayatWaSouq169.pdf Samaritans from Nablus were drawn to work in places like Barkan because they can obtain Israeli citizenship and earn standard Israeli wages.Monika Schreiber, The Comfort of Kin: Samaritan Community, Kinship, and Marriage, BRILL 2014 p.172. Effects on Palestinian Economy It is one of 15 industrial zones set up in the West Bank, providing jobs to Palestinians, and money to their economy, while occupying vast amounts of land that the Palestinians see as part of their future state. A 2007 Israeli Supreme Court judgement obliges Palestinians hired by such plants to receive the same salaries, benefits and conditions as Israelis. According to Diana Buttu, while industrial zones like Barkan supply important jobs to Palestinian workers, their existence challenges Palestinian aspirations for an independent state. Mohammed Mustafa, the Palestinian deputy prime minister for economic affairs, has labeled such industrial parks a form of \\"business colonization\\". By 1998, it extended over 150 dunams (37 acres)Violet Qumsieh, 'The Environmental Impact of Jewish Settlements in the West Bank,' Palestine-Israel Journal, Vol.5 No.1 1998. and since has expanded to cover over 1,300 dunams (about 325 acres) (2013). BDS pressure and legislative action Up to 80% of the Barkan plants‚Äô products are exported, and increasingly subject to threats in Europe of bans on products produced by Israeli industries in the West Bank. Factory owners there say that calls to boycott some factories endanger employment for many Palestinians.Elior Levy,'Palestinians will lose jobs if boycott persists', Ynet 20 May 2012. According to Mohammad Chaichian, the practice of industrial zones like Barkan in the West Bank gives Palestinians, for whom work permits in Israel are restricted, no option but to accept work in what he calls \\"Economic prison zones\\".Mohammad A. Chaichian, Empires and Walls: Globalization, Migration, and Colonial Domination, BRILL 2013 p.312. By 2008 the Park's industries were affected by rising pressure in Europe, from the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, for companies to withdraw their involvement in the park. The partly Dutch owned Barkan Wine Cellars drew up stakes there and moved its facilities to kibbutz Hulda.Giulio Meotti, 'Is BDS campaign working?,' Ynet 31 August 2011. In October 2008, follow the Dutch lead, the Swedish company Assa Abloy, responding in turn to appeals from the Church of SwedenOmar Barghouti,BDS: Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions : the Global Struggle for Palestinian Rights, Haymarket Books, 2011 pp.183-184. and other groups, announced that it would move its production plant belonging to their Israeli subsidiary Mul-T-Lock from Barkan, and relocate inside Israel.‚ÄòAssa Abloy confirms decision to relocate Mul-T-Lock factory from West Bank due to criticism factory was located on \\"occupied\\" land.‚Äô Business & Human Rights Resource Centre ==ReferencesExternal links== * Portal on Shomron R.C. website Category:Industrial parks in Israeli-occupied territories Category:Israeli settlements Category:1982 establishments in the Palestinian territories Category:Israeli industrial parks in the West Bank ","title":"Barkan Industrial Park"},{"id":"5604604","text":" The Lake-class inshore patrol vessel (also known as the Rotoiti class and the Protector class) is a ship class of inshore patrol vessels (IPVs) of the Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN) which replaced the RNZN's s in 2007‚Äì2008. All four vessels are named after New Zealand lakes. Following long-running Navy retention problems in the wake of NZDF \\"civilianisation\\", two of the four vessels were tied up, inactive, in a 'Reduced Activity Period' for long periods between 2013 and 2018. In June 2019 the New Zealand Government announced that two of the patrol vessels would be withdrawn from service, and they were decommissioned in October that year. ==Design and construction== Conceived as part of Project Protector, the Ministry of Defence acquisition project to acquire one multi-role vessel, two offshore and four inshore patrol vessels. The Project Protector vessels were to be operated by the RNZN to conduct tasks for and with the New Zealand Customs Service, the Department of Conservation, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Ministry of Fisheries, Maritime New Zealand, and New Zealand Police. The future duties will include maritime surveillance and boarding, support to civilian agencies such as the customs service and search and rescue duties. Engine room of HMNZS Hawea The ships were built in Whangarei by BAE Systems Australia (formerly Tenix Shipbuilding), and are based on a modified search and rescue vessel for the Philippine Coast Guard, with a different superstructure design. The cost for the four vessels was planned to be NZ$100 million. Friction stir welding was used in the construction of the superstructure, and Donovan Group being the first New Zealand company to use the technique, which is credited as having won them the contract for this part of the vessel's construction.Friction stir welding at Auckland University of Technology (AUT) ==Capabilities and features== The IPVs will normally be used for inshore tasks within of the coastline. However, they will have operational ranges of . Together with their improved speed, this will be sufficient to intercept, for example, large off- shore fishing trawlers working illegally in New Zealand waters. Each vessel was intended to achieve 290 available patrol days per year.http://www.navy.mil.nz/visit-the-fleet/taupo/default.htm M2 12.7x99mm (.50-cal) machine gun on HMNZS Hawea The ships were intended to have the ability to patrol (including receiving vertical replenishment) in up to sea state 5 (seas rough, waves ) and have the ability to survive in conditions of up to sea state 8 (seas very high, waves ). However, boat deployment and recovery will be limited to sea state 4 (seas moderate, waves ). These parameters are much more capable than the Moa class which they replace. The shipbuilder claims \\"the vessel is more than capable of extending the Crown's operational envelope to southern ocean patrol duties\\". ==Possible sale== The patrol boats have seen only limited service. From 2012 the RNZN was only able to crew two of the ships. In April 2016 it was reported that Pukaki and Taupo had not put to sea since 2012 and late 2013 respectively, and the RNZN's website did not identify any activities conducted by Rotoiti since July 2012. In April 2016 New Zealand Defence Minister Gerry Brownlee announced that the New Zealand Government was planning to sell the four ships and replace them with an additional offshore patrol vessel. He justified this on the grounds of the ships' low levels of operational availability, and stated that \\"they've proved themselves to be completely inappropriate for the sort of seas that we have around New Zealand\\". The opposition Labour Party's defence spokesman Phil Goff blamed shortages of naval personnel following cutbacks made by the National Party government in 2012 for the ships' inactivity (see civilianisation project Audit Report), and said that the RNZN still had a need for the vessels. Goff also questioned Brownlee's claim that the ships were unsuitable as they couldn't operate away from the coast, stating that this was not their intended role. In February 2018 the RNZN's in-house newspaper Navy Today reported that three of the IPVs were active, with the fourth to rejoin the fleet later in the year. The Defence Capability Plan 2019, which was published in June 2019, stated that offshore patrol vessels had proven better suited to New Zealand's needs than the inshore patrol vessels, due to the larger ships' longer range, greater endurance and ability to operate helicopters. As a result, the document specified that \\"two inshore patrol vessels will be withdrawn from service and disposed of immediately\\". The fate of the remaining two vessels will be considered ahead of the planned acquisition of a Southern Ocean Patrol Vessel in the mid-2020s. HMNZS Rotoiti and HMNZS Pukaki were decommissioned on 17 October 2019 and are currently awaiting disposal.https://navaltoday.com/2019/10/17/new-zealand-navy-retires- two-inshore-patrol-vessels/ ==Names== *HMNZS Rotoiti (P3569) (commissioned 17 April 2009 - decommissioned 17 October 2019)New Zealand Navy: HMNZS Rotoiti *HMNZS Hawea (P3571) (commissioned 1 May 2009 - in active service)New Zealand Navy: HMNZS Hawea *HMNZS Pukaki (P3568) (commissioned 14 May 2009 - decommissioned 17 October 2019)New Zealand Navy: HMNZS Pukaki *HMNZS Taupo (P3570) (commissioned 29 May 2009 - in active service)New Zealand Navy: HMNZS Taupo These ships' names come from New Zealand lakes: Rotoiti and Taupo in the North Island, Hawea and Pukaki in the South Island.

He was the second son of banker Alexander Brown (1764‚Äì1834) and Grace (n√©e Davison) Brown (1759‚Äì1843). His elder brother was William Brown (who later became the 1st Baronet of Richmond Hill) and his younger brothers were John Brown and James Brown. He emigrated from Ulster to Baltimore, Maryland, at the age of 15 in 1802. ==Career== Brown served as a private in Capt. Henry Thompson's First Baltimore Horse Artillery (aka Capt. Thompson's Co of Cavalry, MD Militia) which defended Baltimore from the British attack during the War of 1812 at the Battle of Baltimore with its Bombardment of Fort McHenry, the Battle of North Point in the southeastern reaches of surrounding, then rural Baltimore County on the Patapsco Neck peninsula, and the stand-off at Loudenschlager's Hill/Hampstead Hill (now Patterson Park) in East Baltimore, on September 12-13-14, 1814. Brown was also the personal guard of Maj. Gen. Samuel Smith, commander of the 3rd Division. In 1834, after the failure of the Bank of Maryland, thousands of citizens rioted in what became known as the Baltimore bank riot. Brown joined up with Capt. Henry Thompson again as a First lieutenant in the City Horse Guards, which were formed in October 1835. Banking career Brown joined his father in the family business, Alex. Brown & Sons, which became one of the leading investment banks of the U.S. in the nineteenth century. His father had started the business in 1800 importing Irish linen and exporting cotton and tobacco back to Britain and was also instrumental in the Second Bank of the United States. As his elder brother, a Liberal Member of Parliament, had founded of the banking-house of Brown, Shipley & Co., George succeeded his father as head of Alex. Brown & Sons upon his death in 1834. In 1818, George partnered with his younger brother John in starting the firm of Brown Bros. & Co. in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His youngest brother James opened an affiliate in New York City in 1825 under the name Brown Brothers, and another in Boston in 1845. These firms were later merged under the name Brown Bros. & Co. and James's son, John Crosby Brown became a driving force for growth, making Wall Street in New York the center for operations and seeing the bank become major lenders to the textile, commodities, and transportation industries. In 1931, the firm merged with Harriman Brothers & Company to form Brown Brothers Harriman & Co., which today is the oldest, and one of the largest, private banks in the United States. In 1827, when bad management almost reduced the Mechanics Bank, of which he was the principal founder, to insolvency, Brown stepped in to become its president, and turned the bank around in a short time. Baltimore and Ohio Railroad George Brown had a prominent role in the founding of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O;), the first common carrier railroad in the U.S.\\"Among ourselves\\", B&O; Magazine, October, 1961, p. 18 On February 12, 1827, he hosted a meeting at his Baltimore home for 24 leading merchants, where Philip E. Thomas joined Brown in advocating the formation of a railroad to make Baltimore competitive with other eastern seaboard ports. Concerned at the potential effect of canals, particularly the successful Erie Canal (completed in 1825) and others being planned, such as the C&O; Canal to Washington, D.C., he served on the committee which studied the development of railroads in Great Britain. At a subsequent meeting in Brown's house (near where Baltimore's City Hall now stands), the committee concluded that the then-unproven technology of a long-haul railroad was feasible and that considerable trade \\"would flow into the State of Maryland, upon the proposed Rail Road,\\" the committee's report concluded. The state agreed, approving a charter for the B&O; Railroad on March 13, 1827. Thereafter, the Mechanics Bank of Baltimore, where George Brown and Philip E. Thomas were officers, had a leading role in the financing and sale of B&O; stock for construction of the first railroad in the U.S.John F. Stover, History of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. W. Lafayette, Ind.:Purdue University Press, 1987. () Brown was subsequently elected as the B&O;'s first treasurer. ==Personal life== On December 17, 1818, Brown was married to Isabella McLanahan (1798‚Äì1885) in Greencastle, Pennsylvania. Isabella was the daughter of John McLanahan and Elizabeth (n√©e Johnston) McLanahan. In 1850, he bought a large estate in Baltimore known as \\"Mondawmin\\" from the estate of Dr. Patrick Macaulay. Together, they were the parents of seven children, four of whom survived to adulthood: * Alexander Brown (1819‚Äì1819), who died in infancy. * Elizabeth Brown (1820‚Äì1830), who died in childhood. * Alexander Davison Brown (1823‚Äì1892), who married Colegate-Die Nisbet, daughter of Judge Nisbet. He later married Laura Hobson, the daughter of his father's lodge keeper which led society to shun him. They later divorced as well. * Grace Ann Brown (1825‚Äì1903), who married Edward McDonald Greenway Jr. (1820‚Äì1895) in 1847. * Isabella Brown (1827‚Äì1856), who married William Hamilton Graham (1823‚Äì1885) in 1850. a director of Alex. Brown & Sons who acquired significant pieces of French art through George A. Lucas. * Elizabeth Johnson Brown (1832‚Äì1847), who died aged fifteen. * George Stewart Brown (1834‚Äì1890), who married Harriet Eaton (1836‚Äì1893) in 1857. Harriet was the sister of Daniel Cady Eaton, the niece of the niece of Elizabeth Cady Stanton and the granddaughter of Amos Eaton and Daniel Cady, in 1857. He became a Brig. Gen. and paymaster general of the Maryland Militia. Brown died at his residence in Baltimore on August 26, 1859. At his death, his estate was valued at $2,500,000 (equivalent to approximately $ billion in dollars), of which about $350,000 was in real estate. In his will, he cancelled a $25,000 mortgage First Presbyterian Church in Baltimore and left $20,000 to Princeton College. Legacy From 1849 until his death, he was president of the House of Refuge for Juvenile Offenders, and also served as the first president of the Baltimore Association for the Improvements of the Conditions of the Poor. He was also an original trustee, appointed by George Peabody, of the Peabody Institute from its inception in 1857 until his death in 1859. The Brown Memorial Presbyterian Church of Baltimore, Maryland was built in 1870 in his memory, funded by Brown's wife. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:1787 births Category:1859 deaths Category:Businesspeople from Baltimore Category:American financiers Category:American railway entrepreneurs Category:American people in rail transportation Category:Baltimore and Ohio Railroad people ","title":"George Brown (financier)"},{"id":"5604659","text":"Pelham Parkway is a working- and middle-class residential neighborhood geographically located in the center of the Bronx, a borough of New York City in the United States.NY Times, Living in Pelham Parkway, the Bronx Its boundaries, starting from the north and moving clockwise are: Waring Avenue to the north, the IRT Dyre Avenue Line tracks () to the east, Neill Avenue to the South, and Bronx River Parkway to the west. White Plains Road is the primary commercial thoroughfare through Pelham Parkway. The neighborhood is named after Pelham Parkway, a major west-east parkway that travels through the East Bronx. Pelham Parkway is part of Bronx Community District 11 and its primary ZIP Codes are 10461 and 10462. It is patrolled by the New York City Police Department's 49th Precinct. ==History== Historical photo of the IRT White Plains Road Line at Pelham Parkway The road named Pelham Parkway was officially called the Bronx and Pelham Parkway since it connects Bronx Park and Pelham Bay Park. It is also an integral part of the Mosholu-Pelham Greenway. The road was established in 1911 and was originally only one lane, which is today‚Äôs westbound lane. The parkway was one part of John Mullaly's vision of creating a vast system of six parks along with connecting parkway roads to link them. The parkway was lined with trees on both sides and had a strict building code. Nobody was allowed to build within of the center. No railroads were allowed to cross over the parkway; this is why the roadbed of the New York, Westchester and Boston Railway, which is now the Dyre Avenue subway line, had to be laid in a tunnel underneath the parkway. Bars and hotels are also prohibited alongside the parkway. Land in 1900 cost between $3,500 and $5,000 for one lot; near Bronx Park the prices were even higher. The neighborhood was named after the Parkway. After a late 20th-century deterioration of the neighborhood, coinciding with what was known as white flight from the Bronx, the Pelham Parkway neighborhood showed signs of revitalization in the new century. Many apartments have been rehabilitated and offered as rentals to the growing middle income population found in the area. A number of buildings have been converted to cooperative ownership and the business section on White Plains Road and Lydig Avenue is a beehive of activity. Their stores reflect the neighborhood's polyglot lineage with many ethnic restaurants side by side with Kosher and Italian butchers and bakeries. Today‚Äôs parkway was constructed in the 1930s and is in length and wide and features wide expanses of lawn with full canopies of trees. The center of the parkway, prior to World War II, was closed off on Sunday mornings for professional bicycle racing. Today, a recreational bikeway runs alongside the westbound motor lanes of the parkway, near the north side of the Parkway. ==Demographics== Based on data from the 2010 United States Census, the population of Pelham Parkway was 30,073, an increase of 67 (0.2%) from the 30,006 counted in 2000. Covering an area of , the neighborhood had a population density of .Table PL-P5 NTA: Total Population and Persons Per Acre - New York City Neighborhood Tabulation Areas*, 2010, Population Division - New York City Department of City Planning, February 2012. Accessed June 16, 2016. The racial makeup of the neighborhood was 36.2% (10,875) White, 10.7% (3,223) African American, 0.2% (59) Native American, 11.3% (3,389) Asian, 0.0% (4) Pacific Islander, 0.7% (196) from other races, and 1.5% (466) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 39.4% (11,861) of the population.Table PL-P3A NTA: Total Population by Mutually Exclusive Race and Hispanic Origin - New York City Neighborhood Tabulation Areas*, 2010, Population Division - New York City Department of City Planning, March 29, 2011. Accessed June 14, 2016. The neighborhood has a significantly diverse population including Albanians (the largest concentration in New York City), Arabs, African Americans, Bosnians, Dominicans, Filipino, Germans, Guyanese, Indians, Irish, Italians, Jamaicans, Jews, Muslims, Pakistanis, Puerto Ricans, and Russians. Hispanics of various races account for 45% of the community; 38% of the community are non-Hispanic White and 20% non-Hispanic Black. Like most neighborhoods in New York City, the vast majority of households are renter occupied. However, there is a large community of co-op owners in the area. There is significant income diversity on a block by block basis, spanning from low wage immigrant households to solid upper middle class. While the poverty rate for The Bronx as a whole is 28%, the poverty rate in the neighborhood, at less than 20%, is much closer to the overall New York City rate of 15%. The entirety of Community District 11, which comprises Pelham Parkway, Allerton, and Morris Park, had 116,180 inhabitants as of NYC Health's 2018 Community Health Profile, with an average life expectancy of 79.9 years. This is lower than the median life expectancy of 81.2 for all New York City neighborhoods. Most inhabitants are youth and middle-aged adults: 22% are between the ages of between 0‚Äì17, 30% between 25‚Äì44, and 24% between 45‚Äì64. The ratio of college- aged and elderly residents was lower, at 9% and 14% respectively. As of 2017, the median household income in Community District 11 was $48,018. In 2018, an estimated 21% of Pelham Parkway and Morris Park residents lived in poverty, compared to 25% in all of the Bronx and 20% in all of New York City. One in eight residents (12%) were unemployed, compared to 13% in the Bronx and 9% in New York City. Rent burden, or the percentage of residents who have difficulty paying their rent, is 55% in Pelham Parkway and Morris Park, compared to the boroughwide and citywide rates of 58% and 51% respectively. Based on this calculation, , Pelham Parkway and Morris Park are considered high-income relative to the rest of the city and not gentrifying. ==Land use and terrain== Pelham Parkway is dominated by 6 and 7-story elevator apartment and coop buildings but the residential streets are lined with a vibrant blend of housing types including detached houses and larger Art Deco and Tudor Style apartment buildings. In the last decade, construction of modern 2 and 3 unit row-houses and apartment buildings have increased the percentage of owners versus renters. The total land area is roughly one square mile. The terrain is relatively low laying and flat. The neighborhood has long served as home to working and middle class New York families. The six-story apartment houses in which they reside provide comfortable living at affordable prices and stand in large numbers throughout the metropolitan area. This commonality of the speculative six-story elevator apartment building has long left this type of construction under-recognized and unappreciated. Though many of these dwellings stand alone or in large concentration; a survey of similar communities affirm that the area is one of few truly cohesive neighborhoods of this typology, offering an unusually compact and well-preserved stretch of these buildings. These structures have proven vital as they contain facilities to meet resident's commercial, religious, and educational needs.http://www.arch.columbia.edu/hp/2007pelham.html Bronx House, a settlement house that moved to Pelham Parkway in the 1950s is the heart of the neighborhood. It is run by the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies as a community center and provides social services, support networks, English Language classes, free lunches for the elderly, and a gym for all neighborhood residents. Bronx Park is located on along the Bronx River, much of which contains the New York Botanical Garden and the Bronx Zoo.

The river flows northward, parallel to the flow of the Brusniƒçka reka, next to the villages of Crna Reka, Koritnik, Ratari and Ploƒçnik. Between the villages of Deviƒç and ƒåeƒçina, the Crna Reka and Brusniƒçka reka meet and continue to the north under the name of Studenica. == Valley == The Studenica carved a long and deep gorge-like valley, characterized by the arc-shaped stretching in the west‚Äìeast direction, between the Radoƒçelo (on the south) and ƒåemerno (on the north) mountains. The villages of Usilje, Pridvorica, Mizdraci, Mlanƒça and Miliƒáe are located in the valley, so as the Isposnica Monastery and the cave on ƒåemerno mountain. But the most important feature in the entire Studenica valley is man-made: the Studenica Monastery, one of the oldest, largest and most famous of all Serbian Orthodox Church monasteries (UNESCO inscribed Studenica Monastery on the List of World Heritage Sites in 1986). Monastery is located near the village of the same name and after the village of Kosuriƒái, the Studenica curves to the north emptying into the Ibar at the small town of U≈°ƒáe. The Studenica belongs to the Black Sea drainage basin, drains an area of 582 km¬≤ itself, and it is not navigable. The name of the river, Studenica, in Serbian means cold water. == Controversy == In the valley, the river has a huge hydro electrical potential, but none is used so far. In the late 1980s and early 1990s government strongly pushed a project of damming the river and building a powerful hydro electrical power plant with the artificial lake. After the public outcry and protests from the Serbian Orthodox Church that the artificial lake would damage the monastery the idea was finally dropped. In the late 2010s, construction of micro hydros in river's watershed began, so as on streams all over Serbia. Draining of the streams instigated protests and ecological, anti-micro hydro movements as people organized in various groups to protect the rivers. Two micro hydros were built on Studenica's tributaries, \\"Brevina\\" and \\"Duboƒçica\\". During the large floods in June 2020, Duboƒçica river damaged the plant washing away the road and the bank where the pipes were laid, breaking the entire pipe system, while \\"Brevina\\" clogged the tidal wave and debris, diverting the water and damaging the bridge. Both dams are named as damaging for the environment. \\"Brevina\\" is located in the Golija-Studenica Biosphere Reserve, the first UNESCO-MAB registered biosphere reserve in Serbia. The river itself was completely rerouted and the natural riverbed was narrowed and left empty. \\"Duboƒçica\\" is also known for the arrests because of the corruption during its construction. == See also == * Rivers in Serbia == References == * Mala Prosvetina Enciklopedija, Third edition (1985); Prosveta; * Jovan ƒê.

She is the author of books on the cultural history of physics, and has written about science, including for the New York Times, Los Angeles Times, Guardian, Aeon and Cabinet. Wertheim and her twin sister, Christine Wertheim, are co-founders of the Institute For Figuring (IFF), a Los Angeles-based non-profit organization though which they create projects at the intersection of art, science and mathematics. Their IFF projects include their Crochet Coral Reef, which has been shown at the 2019 Venice Biennale, Hayward Gallery (London), Museum of Arts and Design (NYC), and the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History. For her work with public science engagement, Wertheim won the 2016 Klopsteg Memorial Award from the American Association of Physics Teachers and Australia's Scientia Medal (2017). == Education and research == Wertheim's education includes two bachelor's degrees, a Bachelor of Science in pure and applied physics from the University of Queensland and a Bachelor of Arts in pure mathematics and computing from the University of Sydney. Wertheim has been a research associate at the American Natural Museum of Natural History located in New York, and is a fellow at the Los Angeles Institute for the Humanities,. She is currently a PhD candidate and researcher at Deakin University. She was the Discovery Fellow (2012-2013) at the University of Southern California, as well as the Vice Chancellor's Fellow (2015) at the University of Melbourne. ==Career== Books Wertheim is the author of a trilogy that considers the role of theoretical physics in the cultural landscape of modern Western society. The first, Pythagoras' Trousers, is a history of the relationship between physics, religion and gender relations. Reviewing the book in The Independent, Jenny Turner writes that the introduction states the book's argument elegantly and compellingly; but the text disappointed her by losing sight of what Turner thought its most interesting goal, telling how physics has been motivated by \\"fantasies of universal mastery\\". The second, The Pearly Gates of Cyberspace, charts the history of scientific thinking about space from Dante to the Internet. Andrew Leonard, reviewing the book for The New York Times, calls Wertheim's thesis, that cyberspace (and behind it, physics) opens up spiritual possibilities, \\"ambitious and fascinating, although in lesser hands it would border on risibility.\\" Leonard finds her account of the evolution of physicists' concept of space impressive, but expresses the view that ultimately she loses faith in her thesis: even if there is, indeed, something human about a great network of relationships that \\"cannot be captured by an equation or a telescope\\". The third, Physics on the Fringe: Smoke Rings, Circlons, and Alternative Theories of Everything, looks at the idiosyncratic world of \\"outsider physicists\\" such as Jim Carter, people with little or no scientific training who develop their own alternative theories of the universe. Freeman Dyson, reviewing the book in The New York Review of Books, notes that it describes research by amateurs, who \\"offer an alternative set of visions ... concrete rather than abstract, physical rather than mathematical.\\" The leading character is Jim Carter, a man with an \\"unshakable belief\\" in a theory of the whole universe constructed of \\"endless hierarchies of circlons\\", circular mechanical objects that reproduce and split like smoke rings. Unknown to Carter, his basic idea that atoms could be explained as subatomic smoke rings had already been proposed in the 1870s by the renowned English physicist William Thomson (later Baron Kelvin), and the Scottish mathematician P.G. Tait. Tait and Thomson's theory of vortex atoms has been called by the historian Helge Kragh \\"a Victorian theory of everything\\", and is now regarded as an early kind of string theory. Journalism As a journalist, Wertheim has written for newspapers in various countries including The New York Times, Los Angeles Times, The Guardian, The Daily Telegraph, and Die Zeit. She has written science articles for magazines including New Scientist, The Sciences, Cabinet, Aeon, The Australian Review of Books, and Australian Geographic. Her work has been included in The Best American Science Writing 2003, edited by Oliver Sacks; and Best Australian Science Writing (2015, 2016, 2018 by Newsouth Press); and Best Writing on Mathematics 2018 (Princeton University Press). Television Wertheim has scripted 10 television documentaries, as well as created and co-directed the award-winning series Catalyst, a six-part science and technology series for a teenage audience. She has produced several short films, and she wrote and directed the interactive Canadian public health program What About AIDS (1988), an early use of laser-disc technology. Wertheim lectures around the globe promoting science within a social justice context. ==Institute For Figuring== The F√∂hr Reef exhibited as part of the Crochet Coral Reef project by Margaret and Christine Wertheim and the Institute For Figuring in T√ºbingen (Germany) in 2013 In 2003, Wertheim and her twin sister Christine, faculty member of the Department of Critical Studies at the California Institute of the Arts, founded the Institute For Figuring, an organisation based in Los Angeles that promotes the poetic and aesthetic dimensions of science and mathematics. The Institute proposes that people can interact directly with mathematical and scientific ideas via material construction methods (such a crochet and paper folding), not simply via abstract equations and formulas. IFF is a nonprofit organization through which the sisters produce their Crochet Coral Reef project, an endeavor they created as an artistic response to climate change and the decimation of the Great Barrier Reef in their Australian homeland. The project also responds to the problem of oceanic plastic trash. While engaging audiences around the world with these environmental concerns, the Crochet Coral Reef also serves as way to teach non-Euclidean geometry. The frilly curling shapes of the Crochet Reef are manifestations of hyperbolic surfaces, the same forms made by living reef organisms. The ability to crochet such forms was discovered in 1997 by Daina Taimi≈Üa, a Cornell University mathematician. Through their work with IFF, the Wertheim sisters have created exhibitions on scientific and mathematical themes at art galleries and science museums around the world, including the 2019 Venice Biennale, Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh, the Santa Monica Museum of Art, the Hayward Gallery, London, Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California, Machine Project, the Museum of Jurassic Technology in Los Angeles, the Science Gallery at Trinity College in Dublin, Museum of Arts and Design, the Cooper Hewitt in New York, and the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C.,. These exhibitions and related public programming make mathematical and scientific concepts accessible to laypeople.  Crochet Coral Reef project  Jeannine Mosely and the business card Menger sponge The Wertheim sister's Crochet Coral Reef project is one of the largest participatory art and science endeavor in the world. By creating giant installations that mimic living coral reefs, crocheted out of yarn and types of plastic, and using algorithms inspired by hyperbolic geometry, the project resides at the intersection of mathematics, science, handicraft, environmentalism and community art practice. The project teaches audiences about non-Euclidean geometry, while also engaging them with the subject of climate change and the decimation of reefs due to global warming. As of early 2020, more than 10,000 people from New York and London, to Riga and Abu Dhabi, have actively contributed pieces to Crochet Coral Reef exhibitions in more than 40 cities and countries. More than two million people have seen these shows. In the foreword to the Crochet Coral Reef book, Donna Haraway calls the project \\"palpable, polymorphous, powerful and terrifying stitchery\\". Wertheim was invited to speak about the project in a Ted Talk in February 2009. The talk has been transcribed into 22 different languages and has surpassed 1.3 million views on the Ted website. Since its beginning in 2005,Crochet Coral Reef has expanded into a constellation of individual reefs including a Bleached Reef, a Toxic Reef made of video-tape and plastic, a Branched Anemone Garden, and a giant Coral Forest ‚Äì consisting of six large-scale sculptures, three crocheted from yarn and three from plastic. The plastic works are inspired by the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, a gigantic gyre of plastic debris in the Pacific Ocean. == Mosley Snowflake Sponge project == Inspired by and working with Jeannine Mosely, a software engineer and origami artist, Margaret Wertheim curated a project at the University of Southern California to create a giant model of a fractal, constructed from 48,912 business cards. Professors, librarians, local artists, school students, and hundreds of USC students all participated in over 3,000 hours of work to complete this object. Discovered by Dr. Mosely in 2006, the Mosely Snowflake is a cousin of the famous Menger Sponge, the first three-dimensional fractal known to mathematicians which was first described by Karl Menger in 1926. The Mosely Snowflake Sponge at USC was the first-ever instantiation of this new fractal form, and has since been reproduced by other groups around the world, including in Madagascar. On display at the University of Southern California's Doheny Memorial Library, the completed Mosely Snowflake Sponge fractal was constructed out of specially designed business cards colored in the Trojans pallet of scarlet and gold, and using several geometric designs taken from the Oliver Byrne version of Euclid's Elements. == Awards and honours == * Print Journalism Award (2006) from the American Institute of Biological Sciences * Theo Westenberger Award (2011) from the Autry Museum * Discovery Fellow at the University of Southern California (2012-2013) * Vice Chancellor's Fellow at the University of Melbourne (2015) * AxS Award from the Pasadena Arts Council, now known as Fulcrum Arts (2016) * Klopsteg Memorial Award (2016) * Scientia Medal (2017) ==Books== ; Physics trilogy * Pythagoras' Trousers: God, Physics, and the Gender Wars (1995) * The Pearly Gates of Cyberspace: A History of Space from Dante to the Internet (1999) * Physics on the Fringe: Smoke Rings, Circlons and Alternative Theories of Everything (2011) ; Guides and catalogs * A Field Guide to Hyperbolic Space (2005) * A Field Guide to the Business Card Menger Sponge (2006) * An Alternative Guide to the Universe: Mavericks, Outsiders, Visionaries.

It contains a single named species, Osteodontornis orri (Orr's Bony-toothed Bird, in literal translation of its scientific name), which was described quite exactly one century after the first species of the Pelagornithidae (Pelagornis miocaenus) was. O. orri was named after then-recently deceased naturalist Ellison Orr.Howard (1957), Olson (1985: p.198) The bony-toothed or pseudotooth birds were initially believed to be related to albatrosses in the Procellariiformes, but actually they seem to be rather close relatives of either pelicans and storks, or of waterfowl, and are here placed in the order Odontopterygiformes to account for this uncertainty. Also, their internal taxonomy is not well-resolved. An earlier-described pseudotooth bird, Cyphornis magnus from Vancouver Island (Canada), was believed to be of Eocene age but is nowadays assumed to have lived about twenty million years ago in the Early Miocene, not too long before the Clarendonian (Middle/Late Miocene) O. orri. It may be that Osteodontornis is a junior synonym of Cyphornis.Bourdon (2005), Olson (1985: pp.198‚Äì199), Mayr (2009: p.59) ==Description== With a wingspan of and a height of when on the ground, Osteodontornis orri and similar giant pseudotooth birdsE.g. the Paleogene Dasornis emuinus and Gigantornis eaglesomei, or the Atlantic contemporary of Osteodontornis, Pelagornis miocaenus were the second-largest flying birds known, surpassed only by the teratorn Argentavis magnificens. The head, from neck to bill-tip, measured about , and the eyesockets were about wide. The humerus, though about as long as a human's, was only about wide at the shoulder end. The skull's quadrate bone measured almost at its widest and was nearly high.Howard (1957), Olson (1985: pp.199‚Äì200), Ono (1989), Mayr (2008), Mayr et al. (2008) Like its relatives, O. orri had a stout but extremely light-boned body, feet that were presumably webbed as in its aquatic relatives, and long and probably very narrow wings resembling those of an albatross. Its beak made up about three-quarters of the head's length and had bony tooth-like serrations that were hollow or maybe filled with cancellous bone. The beak was so heavy the creature probably held it between its shoulders while in flight, just like modern pelicans do. The arrangement of its bony serrations is characteristic for this genus: one small \\"tooth\\", flanked by small points or even smaller \\"teeth\\", is placed between each pair of large ones. However, the \\"tooth\\" pattern of pseudotooth birds changed along the length of the beak, and is not considered a very reliable way to distinguish genera.Hopson (1964), Olson (1985: pp.199‚Äì200), Matsuoka et al. (1998), Palmer (1999: p.180), Rinc√≥n R. & Stucchi (2003) In general lifestyle, it was probably most similar to the albatrosses, tropicbirds and frigatebirds of today, with long slender wings adapted for soaring vast distances over the open seas. Due to its size, the bird is presumed to have been an excellently adapted dynamic soarer. It probably built its nest on high plateaus or similar places, where it could easily take flight by simply walking into the wind with wings spread. It was a seabird that apparently lived mainly off squid and other soft-bodied prey; the \\"teeth\\" were less saw-like than the horny serrations on the beak of the fish-eating saw-billed ducks (Merginae), pointing straight downwards instead and in the fossils often very abraded or broken. The downward-pointing \\"teeth\\" were ideal for digging into and holding slippery, soft-skinned pelagic animals such as cephalopods that were probably snatched out of the water in flight or while swimming. Lightly built as it was, O. orri was probably not a good diver and may have found it impossible to dive at all.Olson (1985: pp.199‚Äì200), Palmer (1999: p.180) Osteodontornis is one of the pseudotooth birds of which rather comprehensive remains are known, but the lack of good fossils of most other Odontopterygiformes allows for few direct comparisons between genera. Still, the distal humerus of the present genus (e.g. the Barstovian specimen LACM 50660 from Kern County, California) can be compared to that of a smaller and older fossilSpecimen MHN-UABCS Te5/6‚Äì517, from Middle Eocene strata of the Tepetate Formation near El Cien (Baja California Sur, Mexico): Gonz√°lez-Barba et al. (2002) tentatively assigned to Odontopteryx. Osteodontornis has a wider and deeper notch between the external condyle and the ectepicondylar prominence, with the pit between these farther from the bone's end, than did the smallish Paleogene species. Its quadrate bone differed from that of Odontopteryx toliapica in a more narrowly grooved dorsal head, and a larger and less forward-pointing orbital process. The forward center of the ventral articulation ridge extends upwards and forward, and the pterygoid process is conspicuously expanded to the upper center in Osteodontornis. The socket for the quadratojugal has an intermediate position and the lateral ridge of the slender main shaft is straight and fairly thin. The quadrate of the mysterious Pseudodontornis longirostris skull (which some consider to belong in Pelagornis) is not very well preserved; it agees with Odontopteryx in a broad main shaft and with Osteodontornis in the straight main shaft ridge and its upward-directed ventral articulation ridge's forward center. Otherwise, it differs from both.Olson (1985: pp.195,198), Ono (1989), Gonz√°lez-Barba et al. (2002) ==Distribution== This species is well documented from various locations of generally Miocene age, although usually by much fragmented remains due to the thin and tender bones it had. Most importantly, it was found on both sides of the North Pacific. It is not certain whether all Osteodontornis remains belong to a single species; size differences suggest that some evolution took place during the timespan in which the genus existed. Thus, some fossils are referred to Osteodontornis only, without further assigning them to this species.Olson (1985: pp.195,198‚Äì199), Matsuoka et al. (1998), Stidham (2004) The type specimen of O. orri, SBMNH 309, is a rather comprehensive fossil preserved mostly as imprint, with some bone pieces and even feather impressions in addition; it was found in Clarendonian (Late Miocene) shale of California (USA). Subsequently, for example in the Barstovian (Middle Miocene) Round Mountain SiltThe distal humerus end LACM 50660, the proximal ulna end LACM 104057, a large beak piece (NMNH PAL 425116) and some other remains: Olson (1985: pp.195,198), Goedert (1989), Gonz√°lez-Barba et al. (2002) or in Late Miocene deposits of the Monterey Formation,Olson (1985: p.198) quite a few additional specimensIncluding upper and lower beak fragments and an atlas vertebra: Hopson (1964) dating from about the same time were found in California. Roughly contemporary specimens were described from the Haranoyan-Tozawan boundary in Japan ‚Äì a complete right quadrate bone (NSM PV-18696) from the Middle Miocene Nagura Formation at Chichibu, Saitama, an Early Miocene right mandible piece (Mizunami Fossil Museum (MFM) 28351) found in the Oi Formation at Misato, Mie, and some additional material of about the same age from the Mizunami Group at Mizunami, Gifu. From the Early Miocene Nye Formation and the Middle Miocene Astoria Formations of Oregon a handful of specimensFrom the Astoria Formation, a proximal ulna end (LACM 128423), a cranium (NMNH PAL 335463), right ulna and humerus which lack the elbow ends (NMNH PAL 335794), and a very worn sternum (NMNH PAL 335293). From the Nye Formation a humerus piece and proximal right coracoid (NMNH PAL 314330), and some cervical vertebrae (NMNH PAL 335621): Ray (1976), Goedert (1989), Olson (1985: pp.196,198,200), Mayr et al. (2008), NMNH-DP [2009] that appear to be Osteodontornis\\"Pseudodontornis\\" in Becker (1987) is a lapsus, should be \\"pseudodontornids\\": Goedert (1989) are known. Similar fossils have been found in the Middle Miocene [Capadare Formation of Venezuela and from the Late Miocene of the Pisco FormationMUSM 210 (beak fragments and an atlas vertebra), MUSM 666 (proximal right humerus head), MUSM 667 (proximal ulna). A well- preserved skull unveiled in 2009 also shows Osteodontornis-like \\"teeth\\", but was apparently of a larger bird: Palmer (1999: p.180), Ch√°vez et al. (2007), GG [2009] of Peru; they might rather be of a distinct but closely related genus, and it must be remembered that at that their time the Isthmus of Panama had not been formed yet so that an affiliation with the Atlantic Pelagornis cannot be discounted. The former, specimen MBLUZ-P-5093 from Cueva del Zumbador in Falc√≥n State, is a premaxilla tip of immense dimensions; its bearer might have exceeded a wingspan of in life. Though some of the Miocene North American material was initially (and sometimes is still) assigned to Pelagornis, recent authors generally place them in the present genus. Hopson (1964), Olson (1985: pp.195‚Äì196,198‚Äì200), Goedert (1989), Ono (1989), Ono & Sakamoto (1991), Matsuoka et al. (1998), Gonz√°lez-Barba et al. (2002), Rinc√≥n R. & Stucchi (2003), Stidham (2004), Ch√°vez et al. (2007), NEO (2008), GG [2009] Some wing bone fossilsSpecimen LACM 128462, a mostly complete proximal end of a left ulna from the Keasey Formation of Washington County, Oregon; presumably also LACM 127875, fragments of the proximal humerus ends, the proximal right ulna and radius of a single individual from the Pittsburg Bluff Formation near Mist: Goedert (1989) from the Eo-Oligocene boundary of Oregon (United States), though assigned to Argillornis (= Dasornis), do not differ much from those of Osteodontornis (as far as can be told in their fragmented state), and may be from an older relative. They are the oldest known remains of large North Pacific pseudotooth birds, but if the enigmatic Cyphornis magnus from the same region dates back to the Paleogene they may well be assignable to that taxon, whatever their systematic affiliations might be beyond that. As few directly comparable bones of sufficient quality exist, the relationship of Osteodontornis to other pseudotooth birds is not completely resolved. As noted above, the entire genus (regardless of how many species can be recognized) may be a junior synonym of Cyphornis. Generally, recent authors have tended to place large Neogene pseudotooth bird fossils from the Atlantic in Pelagornis, and those from the North Pacific in Osteodontornis. It remains to be seen if this east‚Äìwest division can be upheld, but biogeographically it seems quite sensible at least as a working hypothesis until sufficient well- preserved material has been found to make an in-depth study. It is less clear what to make of the Southern Hemisphere pseudotooth birds fossils, none of which are complete enough for more than the most tentative identification. Many seabirds of our time, such as albatrosses and other Procellariiformes, show a phylogenetic division between Northern and Southern Hemisphere lineages, separated by the Equatorial currents. Whether this also held true in the warmer climate of the Miocene is not known, but the general phylogenetic patterns found in Procellariiformes suggests that the north‚Äìsouth division is rather ancient and evolved even before the Miocene.Olson (1985: pp.197‚Äì199), Goedert (1989), Nunn & Stanley (1998), Gonz√°lez-Barba et al. (2002), Mayr (2009: p.57) From the Neogene of New Zealand \\"Pseudodontornis\\" stirtoni has been described, which unlike the rest of its (doubtfully valid) genus is not from the Paleogene Atlantic region. It has been proposed as a monotypic genus Neodontornis, but this has not been widely accepted. It may be valid still, as the bones are of a rather small pseudotooth bird; though apparently too small for Osteodontornis detailed comparisons could be insightful. Its jugal arch is indeed short and very stout behind the orbital process of the prefrontal bone, like in Osteodontornis but apparently unlike in the type species of its supposed genus, P. longirostris. A larger proximal (initially misidentified as distal) humerus piece (CMNZ AV 24,960), probably from the Waiauan (Middle/Late Miocene) and found near the Waipara River mouth, is little if any distinct from O. orri in shape and size; it has a flange at the side and is less straight, but whether these features are natural or due to the damaged state of the specimens is unclear. It also agrees more with Pelagornis than with Paleogene remains from Oregon mentioned above. A distal left humerus end and some wing bone fragments from the Late Oligocene Yamaga Formation of Kitaky≈´sh≈´ (Japan) might be the oldest remains of an Osteodontornis, but their assignment to the present genus is just as uncertain as in the case of the New Zealand fossil. Also from Japan are one or two of the youngest pseudodontorn fossils ‚Äì a fragmentary right humerus from the Early Pliocene Yushima Formation at Maesawa, and probably also a distal right femur (MFM 1801) from the Early PleistoceneGelasian, formerly Late Pliocene: Walker & Geissman (2009) Dainichi Formation at Kakegawa that was initially believed to be from an albatross. These might represent the last survivors of Osteodontornis ‚Äì the Kakegawa fossil at least is a good match in size ‚Äì, but require more study before they can be assigned there.Scarlett (1972), Olson (1985: pp.198‚Äì199), Goedert (1989), Ono (1980, 1989), Matsuoka et al.

It is the sequel to 1983's Track & Field and features seven new Olympic events. Like its predecessor, Hyper Sports has two run buttons and one action button per player. The Japanese release of the game sported an official license for the 1984 Summer Olympics. ==Gameplay== The gameplay is much the same as Track & Field in that the player competes in an event and tries to score the most points based on performance criteria, and also by beating the computer entrants in that event. Also, the player tries to exceed a qualification time, distance, or score to advance to the next event. In Hyper Sports, if all of the events are passed successfully, the player advances to the next round of the same events which are faster and harder to qualify for. The events changed to include these new sports: #Swimming - Swimming speed is controlled by two run buttons, and breathing is controlled by the action button when prompted by swimmer on screen. There is one re-do if a player fouls due to launching before the gun, but only one \\"run\\" at the qualifying time. #Skeet shooting - Selecting left or right shot via the two run buttons while a clay-bird is in the sight. There are three rounds to attempt to pass the qualifying score. If a perfect score is attained then a different pattern follows allowing for a higher score. #Long horse - Speed to run at horse is computer controlled, player jumps and pushes off horse via the action button, and rotates as many times as possible via run buttons (and tries to land straight up on feet). There are three attempts at the qualifying score. #Archery - Firing of the arrow controlled by action button; the elevation angle is controlled by depressing the action button and releasing at the proper time. There are three attempts at passing the qualifying score. #Triple jump - Speed is controlled by the run buttons, jump and angle are controlled by action button. There are three attempts at the qualifying distance, and player fouls if first jump is after the white line. #Weight lifting - Power used to lift weights is controlled by run buttons, while shift of weight from lifting up to pushing above the head is controlled by action button. There are two attempts at the qualifying weight. #Pole vault - Speed to run is preset by computer, while release of pole and body movement is controlled by the action button. Player continues attempting the increasing heights until he/she fouls out (by missing base at the bottom or by knocking off horizontal bar with body at the top). The third foul disqualifies the player. (This event did not feature on the ZX Spectrum version.) ==Reception== In Japan, Game Machine listed Hyper Sports on their August 1, 1984 issue as being the sixth most-successful table arcade unit of the year. The Commodore 64 version was reviewed by Zzap!64 who said that it was \\"a first rate conversion\\" and praised graphics, sound and presentation and received a 90% rating overall.http://www.zzap64.co.uk/cgi- bin/displaypage.pl?issue=005&page=014&thumbstart=0&magazine=zzap&check=1 The ZX Spectrum version was the biggest selling Spectrum game of the month in the Gallup chartshttps://wos.meulie.net/pub/sinclair/magazines/C+VG/Issue047/Pages/CVG04700011.jpg and was voted number 59 in the Your Sinclair \\"Top 100 Games of All Time\\". ==Legacy== Two events from the game-skeet shooting and vault-featured on the BBC television programme \\"First Class\\". In June 2018, Konami announced a reimagining of the game, Hyper Sports R, for Nintendo Switch.

The remaining dioceses of the Church are in the areas of Eastern Uganda, of Northern Uganda, of Ankole and Kigezi, and of Rwenzori. ==Diocese of Namirembe== The first Anglican church structure in what is now Uganda, Kenya, and Tanzania was the Diocese of Eastern Equatorial Africa, which was erected in June 1884. The first bishop was James Hannington, who made the diocesan headquarters at Mombassa, but he was assassinated (martyred) on 8 February 1886. The third Bishop of Eastern Equatorial Africa, Alfred Tucker, resolved to divide the diocese: he stayed on Bishop of Uganda, while Kenya and part of northern Tanganyika became the Diocese of Mombasa;Mung'ong'o, Phanuel L. & Matonya, Moses. \\"The Anglican Church of Tanzania\\", in Ian S. Markham, J. Barney Hawkins, IV, Justyn Terry, Leslie Nu√±ez Steffensen (eds) The Wiley-Blackwell Companion to the Anglican Communion (p. 255) the division was effected in 1898. From then until 1926 ‚Äî when the Diocese of Upper Nile was dividing from it ‚Äî the Diocese of Uganda included all Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi, in what was then the country of Zaire. On 1 July 1960, in preparation for the formation of an independent church province, the diocese was split in five: one of the smaller new dioceses retained the same bishop and became the Diocese of Namirembe (so her bishop became Bishop of Namirembe). After the division, the diocese's territory was East Buganda and Busoga. Brown was elected to become the first archbishop of the new province and took up the post in 1961, when the eight dioceses were erected into the Church of the Province of Uganda and Ruanda-Urundi. The arrangement whereby the Archbishop was elected ended in 1977, when the Bishop of Kampala became Archbishop ex officio. Since 1890, throughout its many changes, the diocese's mother church has been St Paul's Cathedral, on Namirembe hill in Kampala. The current building is the fifth Namirembe Cathedral on the same site.

All six events from the first game, 1983's Track & Field, are included, but only three events (swimming, pole vault and triple jump) are taken from the sequel, Hyper Sports. International Track & Field uses the three-button control system of its predecessors (two run buttons and one action button per player) and the eleven disciplines can be attempted in any order. ==Gameplay== Players compete in the real-life events 100m sprint, long jump, shot put, 100m free style, 110m hurdle, high jump, hammer, triple jump, javelin, pole vault, and discus. ==Reception== In Japan, Game Machine listed International Track & Field on their August 1, 1996 issue as being the fourth most-successful arcade game of the year. International Track & Field received generally positive reviews, with the four-player competitive mode drawing the most praise. The two sports reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly both gave the game a 7 out of 10. Dindo Perez said that the game is fun, especially with four player multiplayer, but loses its appeal after extensive play, while Todd Morwatt commented, \\"They don't have an official Olympics license, but the game has a good assortment of Olympic-style events and a strong graphic look that should satisfy die-hard track and field fanatics.\\" Writing in Maximum, Daniel Jevons remarked that as with most games in the genre, the gameplay is fairly simple, but that the fierce competitiveness of four-player sessions makes the game one of the best social experiences on the PlayStation. Johnny Ballgame of GamePro summarized that \\"Revamped from its glory days in the arcades, International Track & Field triumphs with terrific traditional gameplay that's enhanced by gold-medal 32-bit graphics.\\" He particularly noted the easy to learn but difficult to master gameplay, fiercely competitive multiplayer, and dramatic animations.

The book was released in hardcover on April 7, 2004 by Miramax Books (USA) and Viking Press (UK) and a paperback edition was released the following year by Penguin. The book's title refers to rumors that one of the characters routinely gets her hair dyed a certain shade of blonde at Bergdorf Goodman, a luxury goods department store in Midtown Manhattan. ==Synopsis== The book follows an unnamed young socialite living in New York as she interacts with her best friend Julie and tries to find a successful romantic relationship. Initially she believes that she's found \\"The One\\" in the photographer Zack and the two become engaged, after which point Zack becomes emotionally abusive and unresponsive. Despite her best attempts to salvage the relationship, the protagonist is dumped by Zack. Not only does this harm her social standing, but the protagonist is psychologically devastated by the end of the relationship and becomes anorexic as a result. Things are not made much better by her mother's insistence that she return home to England (her family emigrated there during the narrator's childhood) and strike up a relationship with a local Earl that they haven't seen since a disastrous business transaction with her father years ago. The protagonist goes through several terrible relationships with married men (she was told that they were single or separated) and finds herself drawn to and irritated by the filmmaker Charlie, who has started dating her friend Julie. The two eventually end up running into each other at a hotel one night after the protagonist's apartment is robbed. Despite some friction between the two, the protagonist finds that she genuinely likes Charlie, who tells her that he's broken up with Julie. The two end up having sex, something that weighs upon the protagonist's conscience since she has a rule against sleeping with a friend's ex-boyfriend. The following day Julie ends up finding out about the sexual encounter after questioning the protagonist about the night's events, upon which point she reveals that she and Charlie never broke up and tells the protagonist that she never wants to see her again. Since the friendship is gone, the protagonist decides to see Charlie again that night, as he had invited her to return for dinner. However the protagonist finds that Charlie has left, giving her the impression that he was just using her like the other men she has dated. She ends up deciding to return to England, only for her car to break down partway to her parents‚Äô house. The protagonist manages to make it to the home owned by the Earl, where she runs into Charlie, who tells her that he is the Earl her mother wanted her to meet and that he had left the United States due to news of his father's death. At this point her mother arrives under the guise of taking the protagonist home, with the intention of making her way back into Charlie's mother's good graces. This all proves to be too much for the protagonist and before leaving, she tells Charlie that she hates him and that she can no longer trust him since he never trusted her with any of this information. After returning home the protagonist ends up talking with Julie (who has traveled to England), who confesses that she and Charlie had broken up when he'd said they had but that she'd covered up the information since traditionally Julie was always the one to end a relationship. This causes the protagonist to realize that Charlie had never intended to be dishonest and she eventually meets up with him at his home, where they reconcile and officially become a couple. == Reception== Critical reception for Bergdorf Blondes has been polarized. Hannah Sampson, writing for Knight-Ridder, called it a \\"superficial, vapid novel\\" that \\" refuses to be fun, interesting, witty or memorable.\\" Rachel Cooke of The Guardian gave an overly negative review for Bergdorf Blondes, writing, \\"It is not that this book is badly written, nor even that it is poorly plotted ... It is simply that it is so horribly empty, a bilious swirl of superficial characters and sickly values.\\" In contrast, USA Today was more favorable in its review, writing that \\"Blondes is an over-the-top, witty social comedy sure to put a spring in your step ‚Äî whether you're walking in Manolos or Keds.\\" People magazine gave the book two and a half stars out of four, commenting that \\"Bergdorf Blondes is packed with delicious sociological observations, one- liners (\\"Ralph Lauren is my drug of choice,\\" declares someone named Muffy) and tart definitions (\\"PJ\\" is a private jet; \\"Arizona\\" is a euphemism for rehab; \\"CBK\\" is Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, possessor of ideal hair). But it's hard to care about the airhead-ed characters. One wishes Sykes had abandoned chick lit conventions and bared her Nars Candy Darling-varnished nails with an all-out Tom Wolfe-style satire.

He joined the navy as a teenager, following his Cornish hero, the circumnavigator Samuel Wallis into service. Hennah became a lieutenant in the general promotion at the outbreak of the French Revolutionary War in 1793, but afterwards had little opportunity for distinction until 1800, when he participated in a boat raid on the Morbihan river in which the French corvette R√©loaise was burnt. He reportedly acquitted himself \\"with great judgement and gallantry\\", under the command of Lieutenant John Pilfold, another lieutenant who was to command a ship at Trafalgar. == Trafalgar == Following the Peace of Amiens, Hennah was posted to HMS Mars as first lieutenant under George Duff, and was with the ship during the lead up to the battle of Trafalgar in 1805, when Mars was the first ship to spot the advancing enemy. He was stationed on the quarterdeck during the battle, and following the early death of Captain Duff, Hennah took command of the ship, directing her fire into the Fougueux, despite serious damage to his ship. Mars was so battered by the engagement that she was almost unmanoeuvrable, but continued to fire on any enemy ship which approached, including the French Alg√©siras and the Spanish Monarca. Following the action and emergency repairs, the Mars returned to Gibraltar with some difficulty, before Hennah was ordered home that winter. == Later life == Back in London, Hennah received the Thanks of Parliament and a Sword from the Patriotic Fund, and was promoted to Captain on 1 January 1806. He also received the very unusual honour of a Letter of Commendation from the ship's company, indicative of the esteem with which he was held even by the common sailors who served under him, who were rarely given over to such overt displays of affection. Hennah did not serve at sea again, settling with his family at Tregony in Cornwall where he lived as a country gentleman and involved himself in local affairs. He was invested as a Companion of the Bath in 1831, on the occasion of King William IV's Coronation Honours. He died peacefully at home in 1832 and was buried nearby at St Cuby Parish Church. His obituary in The Times of 31 December 1832 read: \\"On the 22inst at Tregony, Cornwall, Captain William Hennah CB one of the old school of British sailors, having entered the navy under Wallis, the circumnavigator and finished his active career in the wake of Collingwood at Trafalgar.\\" == Letter to Mrs George Duff == Letter Source of letter text dated HMS Mars, off Cadiz 27 October 1805 from First Lieutenant William Hennah to Mrs George Duff Madam, I believe that a more unpleasant task, than what is now imposed upon me, can scarcely fall to the lot of a person, whose feelings are not more immediately connected by the nearer ties of kindred, but from a sense of duty, (as first Lieutenant of the Mars,) as being myself the husband of a beloved partner, and the father of children; out of the pure respect and esteem to the memory of our late gallant Captain, I should consider myself guilty of a base neglect, should you only be informed of the melancholy circumstances attending the late glorious, though unfortunate victory to many, by a public gazette. The consequences of such an event, while it may occasion the rejoicings of the nation, will in every instance be attended with the deepest regrets of a few. Alas! Madam, how unfortunate shall I think myself, should this be the first intimation you may have of the irreparable loss you have met with! what apology can I make for entering on a subject so tender and so fraught with sorrow, but to recommend an humble reliance on this great truth, that the ways of Providence, although sometimes inscrutable, are always for the best. By this, Madam, you are in all probability acquainted with the purport of my letter. Amongst the number of heroes who fell on that ever-memorable 21st inst. in defence of their King and Country; after gloriously discharging his duty to both; our meritorious and much respected Commander, Captain George Duff, is honourably classed; his fate was instantaneous; and he resigned his soul into the hands of the Almighty without a moment's pain. Poor Norwich Norwich Duff, son of Captain George Duff, who was serving aboared Mars at the time of Trafalgar is very well. Capatain Blackwood has taken him on board the Euryalas, with the other young gentlemen that came with him, and their schoolmaster. The whole of the Captain's papers and effects are sealed up, and will be kept in a place of security until proper persons are appointed to examine them. Meanwhile, Madam, I beg leave to assure you of my readiness to give you any information, or render you any service in my power. ::And am, Madam, with the greatest respect, :::Your most obedient and most humble servant, ::::WILLIAM HENNAH. == References  Further reading == *The Trafalgar Captains, Colin White and the 1805 Club, Chatham Publishing, London, 2005, == External links == * Nelson-society.org *Animation of the Battle of Trafalgar * William Hennah's descendants Category:1768 births Category:1832 deaths Category:People from St Austell Category:People from Tregony Category:Royal Navy officers Category:Companions of the Order of the Bath Category:Burials in Cornwall ","title":"William Hennah"},{"id":"5604894","text":"Presbyornis is an extinct genus of anseriform bird. It contains two unequivocally accepted species; the well-known P. pervetus and the much lesser-known P. isoni. P. pervetus was approximately the size and shape of a goose, but with longer legs; P. isoni, known from a few bones, was much larger, more than swan-sized. Other fossils, more doubtfully assigned to this genus, are also known. ==Fossils== Artist's impression The fossil record of P. pervetus includes many complete skeletons from Green River Formation sites (Early Eocene), suggesting that the birds nested in colonies and possibly were liable to succumb to botulism, similar to many colony-nesting waterfowl or shorebirds today. P. isoni is known from the Late Paleocene Aquia Formation (Maryland, 61-62 MYA) humerus (USNM 294116) and a fingerbone (USNM 294117) that were initially described, as well as from the humeri that were initially believed to be from Headonornis (BMNH PAL 3686, 5105, 6240). As these are Late Eocene or even Early Oligocene (BMNH PAL 5105, Bembridge Marls) in age, they possibly belong to a distinct taxon. P. recurvirostris is a disputed species possibly synonymous with P. pervetus; it is known from a partial wing (KUVP 10105) found in Colton Formation Eocene sediments of the Wasatch Plateau near Ephraim, Utah. Undescribed fossils are also known from the Paleocene of Utah and possibly the Early Eocene of Mongolia.Kurochkin et al. (2002) The coracoid still assigned to HeadonornisDyke (2001) may also belong into this genus. ==Description== Presbyornis was one of the first anseriforms. Because of its long legs and neck, Presbyornis was initially mistaken for a flamingo, but it was reclassified as an anseriform when the duck-like anatomy of its skull and bill was found. Later, it was believed to represent a transitional stage between the anseriforms and the shorebirds, but it is now considered a member of an extinct group of anseriforms which was most closely related to modern screamers. Judging from numerous fossil findings, Presbyornis is presumed to have lived in colonies around shallow lakes. Its broad, flat bill was used to filter food (small plants and animals) from the water, in the manner of today's dabbling ducks.Palmer (1999) ==FootnotesReferences== * (2001): The Fossil Waterfowl (Aves: Anseriformes) from the Eocene of England.

Written and produced by Motown CEO Berry Gordy Jr., \\"Do You Love Me?\\" was the Contours' only Top 40 single on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the United States. Notably, the record achieved this feat twice, once in 1962 (No 3) and again in 1988 (No 11). A main point of the song is to name the Mashed Potato, The Twist, many other 1960s fad dances, and a variation of the title \\"I like it like that\\", as \\"You like it like this\\". The song is noted for the spoken recitation heard in the introduction which goes: \\"You broke my heart / 'Cause I couldn't dance / You didn't even want me around / And now I'm back / To let you know / I can really shake 'em down.\\" The song has a false ending. ==Original release== Berry Gordy wrote \\"Do You Love Me\\" with the intention that The Temptations, who had no Top 40 hits to their name yet, would record it. However, when Gordy set out to locate the group and record the song, they were nowhere to be found (the Temptations had not been made aware of Gordy's intentions and had departed Motown's Hitsville USA recording studio for a local Detroit gospel music showcase). After spending some time looking for the Temptations, Gordy ran into the Contours (Billy Gordon, Hubert Johnson, Billy Hoggs, Joe Billingslea, Sylvester Potts, and guitarist Hugh Davis) in the hallway. Wanting to record and release \\"Do You Love Me\\" as soon as possible, Gordy decided to let them have his \\"sure-fire hit\\" instead of the Temptations. The Contours, who were in danger of being dropped from the label after their first two singles (\\"Whole Lotta' Woman\\" and \\"The Stretch\\") failed to chart, were so elated at Gordy's offer that they immediately began hugging and thanking him. \\"Do You Love Me\\", the fifth release on Gordy Records, became a notably successful dance record, built around Gordon's screaming vocals. Selling over a million copies, \\"Do You Love Me\\" peaked at No 3 on the Billboard Hot 100 for three weeks starting on October 20, 1962 and was a No 1 hit on the Billboard R&B; Singles chart. An album featuring the single, Do You Love Me (Now That I Can Dance), was also released. None of the Contours' future singles lived up to the success of \\"Do You Love Me\\", although its success won the group a headlining position on Motown's very first Motor Town Revue tour. == Legacy == According to music journalist Kingsley Abbott, \\"Do You Love Me\\" is representative of Gordy's talent as a musician, producer, arranger, and songwriter: \\"The result is not only classic rock and roll but a tribute to his stature as the greatest backstage talent in rock history.\\" Gordy viewed the song as an example of the musical overlap between rhythm and blues, pop, and rock and roll, telling Billboard in 1963, \\"It was recorded r. & b. but by the time it reached the half-million mark, it was considered pop. And if we hadn't recorded it with a Negro artist, it would have been considered rock and roll.\\" ==Covers== Like many American R&B; songs of the 1960s, \\"Do You Love Me?\\" was covered by a number of British Invasion groups. Three British groups who recorded their own versions of the song were Brian Poole and the Tremeloes (who hit number one with it in the UK Singles Chart after learning it from Liverpool's Faron's Flamingos), the Dave Clark Five, and The Hollies on their 1964 album Stay with the Hollies. * The song has also been covered by The Sonics, The Kingsmen, Paul Revere & the Raiders, and Johnny Thunders and the Heartbreakers. * In 1965, Bob Marley and the Wailers recorded the song \\"Playboy\\", which incorporates \\"Do You Love Me\\"'s chorus. * The song was covered by the English glam rock band Mud for their album Mud Rock (1974). * The song was one of the highlights of The Blues Brothers' live set. * Bruce Springsteen frequently ended his shows in the mid-1980s with the song, as part of a medley with \\"Twist and Shout\\". * Alvin and the Chipmunks covered the song for their 1988 album The Chipmunks and The Chipettes: Born to Rock. * Indie band Steadman has a well known cover of the song, played in the style of the Dave Clark Five. * Andy Fraser covered the song in the style of 1980s rock back in 1984. * In 1992 David Hasselhoff famously sang the song in an episode of Baywatch. * Westlife performed a live version for their The Greatest Hits Tour in 2003. * German girl group Preluders covered the song for their cover album Prelude to History in 2004. * Also 2004, the song was covered by Izzy Stradlin in collaboration with Steven Adler. The song was never officially released on an album or on iTunes. * In November 2013, The Overtones covered the song for their album Saturday Night at the Movies. * In February 2015, Chester See & Andy Lange uploaded a cover of \\"Do You Love Me\\" to See's YouTube channel. * In 2017 Colt Prattes, Nicole Scherzinger, and J. Quinton Johnson covered the song for ABC's 2017 Dirty Dancing movie remake. * In 2018, Ian Gillan and the Javelins recorded a version as the lead single of their self-titled album of rock and roll covers. ==Revival== * \\"Do You Love Me\\" is featured prominently in the 1987 film Dirty Dancing, reviving the record's popularity. Re-issued as a single from the More Dirty Dancing soundtrack album, \\"Do You Love Me\\" became a hit for the second time, peaking at number eleven on the Billboard Hot 100 in August 1988. The Contours, by then composed of Joe Billingslea and three new members, joined Ronnie Spector and Bill Medley, among others, on a 'Dirty Dancing Tour' resulting from the success of the film. * The song also appeared in the episode \\"The End\\" in season 5 of TV series Supernatural. * The song was also made into a music video in Tiny Toon Adventures Episode 90, \\"Toon TV\\" (November 9, 1992). * David Hasselhoff performed it on \\"Do You Love Me\\" with Kids Incorporated in 1984 in the Season 1 episode 15 \\"School's for Fools\\". He later performed it on Baywatch in season 2 episode 12, \\"Reunion\\" (January 27, 1992). * Kids Incorporated covered \\"Do You Love Me\\" in 1991 during the Season 7 episode 109 \\"Teen Spotlight\\". ==Remix== With the re-release of the single in 1988, Motown also released a 12\\" maxi-single (Motown 68009) with an extended dance remix, running 6:26. The remix was also included in the late 1988 Motown CD reissue of the album Do You Love Me (Now That I Can Dance) on Motown 37463-5415-2. This remix only appears on the CD and Cassette tape issues, as the Vinyl LP of the same release has the original 2:54 minute hit version. ==Soundtrack== This song was in the soundtrack for Dirty Dancing (1987), Sleepwalkers (1992), and Getting Even with Dad (1994). It was featured in the 1979 movie The Wanderers. The song also had an appearance in Beethoven's 2nd (1993), where George Newton (Charles Grodin) dances to the song while preparing his breakfast. It was also featured in Teen Wolf Too, sung by Jason Bateman, in 1987. ==Personnel: The Contours== *Lead vocal by Billy Gordon *Background vocals by Hubert Johnson, Billy Hoggs, Joe Billingslea, and Sylvester Potts *Guitar by Huey Davis *Instrumentation by The Funk Brothers **Piano by Joe Hunter **Bass by James Jamerson **Drums by Benny Benjamin ==See also== * List of 1960s one-hit wonders in the United States ==ReferencesExternal links== * * List of cover versions of \\"Do You Love Me\\" at SecondHandSongs.com Category:1962 singles Category:1963 singles Category:1987 singles Category:1988 singles Category:The Contours songs Category:Billboard Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs number- one singles Category:UK Singles Chart number-one singles Category:Irish Singles Chart number-one singles Category:Songs written by Berry Gordy Category:Song recordings produced by Berry Gordy Category:Gordy Records singles Category:1962 songs Category:Songs about dancing ","title":"Do You Love Me"},{"id":"5604941","text":"Huer's Hut on the headland of Towan Head In English fishing customs, a conder, also called a huer or bulker, was a person who stood on high places near the sea coast in times of herring-fishing to signal to the fishers which way the shoal of herrings or pilchards passed--their course being more discernible to those who stand on high cliffs, due to the blue colour they cause in the water, than to those aboard vessels.

It was closed in 2012 due to a decrease in the number of inmates in the Virginia corrections system and expensive ongoing maintenance needs. The facility served as a reception and classification facility.\\"Mecklenburg Correctional Center (male classification/intake institution) .\\" Virginia Department of Corrections. Retrieved on August 22, 2010. Mecklenburg formerly housed the Commonwealth of Virginia's male death row. It is located at (36.6607, -78.3636). ==History== It first opened in 1976. Opened at a cost of $20 million, this 360-inmate facility was intended to serve as the facility for the \\"worst of the worst\\" among inmates in the Virginia Department of Corrections system - a maximum security prison. At the opening ceremony, Governor Mills E. Godwin Jr. stated that the facility served as a \\"monument to failure\\", as the inmates to be housed there were viewed as the most incorrigible and likely unable to be returned to free society. The first warden at Mecklenburg was Gene Johnson. Johnson's assistant warden for operations and security was Fred L. Finkbeiner, who had served as the warden of the well-known Joliet and Pontiac maximum- security prisons in Illinois. On August 3, 1998, the male death row moved to its current location, the Sussex I State Prison, from the Mecklenburg Correctional Center.\\"Facts about Virginia's Death Row\\" (). NBC4 Washington. Tuesday November 10, 2009. Retrieved on May 29, 2012. The 1984 escape from death row Six inmates facing the Virginia electric chair made an escape from the facility on May 31, 1984. The inmates who escaped consisted of two of the Briley Brothers (James and Linwood), along with Lem Tuggle, Earl Clanton, Derick Peterson, and Willie Jones. They had observed how correctional officers were complacent and often failed to follow security procedures. While returning to the building from evening recreation time around 8:00 pm, Clanton hid in the bathroom next to the entrance of the death row cell block, then charged out on cue from another inmate when the adjacent control room's door was left open. Clanton overpowered the officer inside and released all of the locks in the cell block. Inmates took over the block with homemade knives and blindfolded and bound responding officers, changing into their uniforms. They bluffed their way out of the prison by calling the front gate of the prison and pretending to be officers who needed a van supplied and both gates opened to aid in the disposal of a bomb supposedly constructed by the inmates. The bomb was actually a portable TV covered with a blanket. The group correctly deduced that the prison had no set protocol for bomb disposal and so the gate officer could be fooled into opening both gates at the same time, in violation of standard procedure. The six escapees put on riot helmets to conceal their faces and carried the TV out of the unit on a stretcher while spraying it with a fire extinguisher. They put it into the waiting van, which they drove straight out of the prison at 10:47 pm. Once the six men were free, they crossed into nearby North Carolina. Unable to agree on their next move, they soon split up in the town of Warrenton and abandoned the van in a schoolyard. Clanton and Peterson were caught the following afternoon, on June 1, in Warrenton. A patrol car driving past a laundromat spotted the two men inside, one of them wearing what appeared to be a correctional officers' jacket with the badges torn off. They had stopped to eat cheese and drink wine from a convenience store. Tuggle, Jones and the Briley brothers stole a pickup truck with the vanity tag 'PEI-1' from the driveway of its owner. The Brileys were dropped off in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where a local uncle got them a job at a North Philadelphia car garage under assumed names. Tuggle and Jones planned to continue north into Canada, as they knew that Canadian authorities would not extradite fugitives facing execution. They got as far north as Vermont, where Tuggle was apprehended in Stamford on June 8 after robbing a souvenir shop for $80. Jones gave himself up the following day, on June 9, just five miles south of the Canada‚ÄìUS border in Jay, Vermont. He was cold, hungry, and bitten by flies, so he called his mother, who persuaded him to turn himself in. Tuggle and Jones were housed at Marble Valley Correctional Facility in Rutland, pending extradition back to Virginia. The Brileys were caught last, on June 19, after the FBI traced a phone call they made to a contact in New York City back to the garage where they were working. All six men were returned to Virginia under heavy security. Upon their return, they were held on $10 million bond each. Much of what has been revealed about the escape came from fellow inmate Dennis Stockton. Stockton was also on death row for murder and originally planned to escape with them, but backed out because he anticipated his case would be overturned on appeal. During the escape, he wrote down everything that happened minute by minute in his diaries, which were later published in a Norfolk, Virginia newspaper, the Virginian Pilot. Stockton did not succeed in his appeal and was executed in 1995.

The director of the Department of Corrections was forced to resign. The warden of the facility, Gary Bass, was transferred from that position. In federal courtroom testimony in a case involving the prison on September 27, 1984, Bass stated that various lawsuits against the prison had weakened morale among corrections staff and left them feeling that the \\"ACLU was running the prison\\". In the years that followed the 1984 escape, the department undertook many reforms at Mecklenburg Correctional Center. Educational programs were introduced for inmates, as well as work details. COs received better training, to reduce prisoner abuse and ensure that force was used only when emergency situations warranted it. The number of inmate-on-CO assaults dropped significantly in the following years. Facility reclassification The prison was proposed for closure by Governor L. Douglas Wilder in 1993. However, the succeeding administration of Governor George F. Allen determined that Mecklenburg should remain open, reclassifying it from a maximum security to medium security 'intake' facility. During the prison's last decade of operation, it was used to house inmates short term. They were newly convicted and spent a few months at Mecklenburg before being classified based on their security risk and reassigned to other prisons. Death row was moved from this facility to Sussex I State Prison near Waverly, Virginia in 1997. ==Closure== In 2011, Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell ordered MCC closed, citing removal of 1,000 Pennsylvania inmates who were housed at another facility (Green Rock Correctional Center) under contract. MCC closed May 24, 2012 and was slated for demolition in 2013. The Virginia Department of Corrections plans to limit what is sent to a landfill to just 50 tons of demolition debris, or 2 percent of the project‚Äôs estimated total. In November, 2017, the demolition of the center was completed and the land was deeded to the town of Boydton. It has been zoned M-1 for possible future industrial use. ==See also== *List of prison escapes ==ReferencesFurther reading== *\\"Escape Taught Hard Lesson - Death Row Flight Saw Fear Wipe Out Security Illusion\\", Frank Green and Michael Hardy, Richmond Times-Dispatch, May 29, 1994 *\\"Plot Warnings Were in Vain\\", Frank Green and Wes Allison, Richmond Times-Dispatch, May 29, 1994 *\\"Five Years After 'Great Escape' - Bomb Set Off Prison Changes\\", Jim Mason, Richmond Times-Dispatch, May 30, 1989 ==External links== * \\"Mecklenburg Correctional Center (male classification/intake institution).\\" Virginia Department of Corrections.

SEALNet was founded in 2004 by undergraduate students at Stanford University in collaboration with members from the Southeast Asian Leadership Initiative (SALI). In 2006, SEALNet and SALI merged under the SEALNet name. SEALNet's mission is to promote service leadership among Southeast Asian communities in the US and abroad. It accomplishes this by building and nurturing a community of service leaders who are committed to serve. ==History== Founded in 2004 at Stanford University by Southeast Asian undergraduates under the mentorship of SALI members, SEALNet conducted its first project in the summer of 2005 in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. The project worked at the Ho Chi Minh City Youth Union to provide computers and English language learning software to students and with a group of high school students to teach them skills of leadership and project design. In 2007, SEALNet was given a grant by the Singapore MFA as part of the ASEAN 40th anniversary celebrations. By the end of the 2010 project cycle, SEALNet's all- volunteer community has organized over 28 projects across seven of the 10 ASEAN countries (all except Singapore, Brunei, and Myanmar). There are over 1000 members of SEALNet (high school students, college students and mentor professionals) from around the world. Members are trained in service and leadership. One major training event is the annual Service Leadership Training Retreat. The first training retreat was run in 2005 at the Wildwood Retreat in Santa Rosa, California. == Chapters == SEALNet has chapters at Stanford University and M.I.T. in the United States and a chapter at NUS in Singapore. The organization's finances and administration within the United States is conducted by the 501(c)(3) registered within the State of California, \\"SEALNet, Inc.\\" In Singapore, the finances and administration are conducted by the registered Public Company Limited by Guarantee \\"SEALNet (Singapore) Limited.\\" SEALNet's long-term goals include the addition of more chapters within the United States and across Southeast Asia.

It was originally released in the United Kingdom during September or October 1977. The album comprises studio demos and talking recorded with Dave Goodman during 1976 and early 1977, while original bass player Glen Matlock was still a member of the band. Most of the songs would later be re-recorded and officially released on the group's album, Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols. ==The alternative debut album== Several parties, including some journalists in the British music press, immediately suspected that the band's manager, Malcolm McLaren, was responsible for the original Spunk bootleg. This would have been in breach of the band's record contract with Virgin, which was readying the release of Never Mind the Bollocks when Spunk appeared. An October 1977 Sounds article by Chas de Whalley discussed Spunk and made reference to this conveniently coincidental timing. In the Sounds article, Chas de Whalley makes reference to buying a copy in a record store on the Portobello Road. It was in fact a tiny little record store (ACME Records) in the back of the now famous ACME Attractions. The shop assistant who dealt with de Whalley, identified in his article simply as \\"The Punk,\\" was Doug McArthur, bassist for Killerhertz and Kid Rogers and the Henchmen. McArthur maintained the bootleg was a better quality record and claims to have sold many copies through that little record store. The evidence for McLaren's involvement is speculative, although it can be noted that his company, Glitterbest, retained the rights to the demo recordings as well as the master tapes ‚Äì and the demos appearing on Spunk were presented in excellent quality. Also, as evidenced by the original album's \\"LYN-\\" matrix number prefix, the record had clearly been pressed in the UK by Lyntone, a legitimate independent pressing plant that would presumably not handle anything that appeared to be a bootleg, and would certainly allow the bootlegger in question to be traced if enquiries had ever been made by the genuine copyright owner. McLaren always publicly denied responsibility for Spunk, but said that he preferred it to Never Mind the Bollocks. During a BBC Radio 1 interview with rock journalist John Tobler shortly after the release of Never Mind The Bollocks, when asked about the bootleg, both Johnny Rotten and Sid Vicious claimed that they hadn't received a free copy, and criticized the bootleg. Rotten in particular criticized the idea of someone else making money out of one's efforts and that the material on it was 'substandard, and it should be kept unreleased'. When asked about if he knew who did it, Rotten replied: \\"Yes...I'm not going to say.\\" Some Sex Pistols fans concur with McLaren ‚Äì and producer Goodman ‚Äì that the raw versions of the songs on Spunk are superior to the officially released ones, particularly since Spunk approximates a faithful reproduction of the original Sex Pistols line-up's live sound. The album also features the bass-lines of Glen Matlock, which were not reproduced when guitarist Steve Jones took over bass duties for the recording of Never Mind the Bollocks. Spunk is therefore often cited as the Sex Pistols' de facto alternative debut album. Certainly a tape of part or all of Spunk had been played to Tony Parsons as early as March 1977, and became the subject of his NME article, \\"Blank Nuggets in the UK\\", which described the recordings as if they represented an imminent debut album release. == Reissues == The original Spunk was itself copied and bootlegged immediately upon release. The tracks have since been re-bootlegged countless times in many different formats, including a widespread variant called No Future UK?, which added three extra tracks, and many releases by Dave Goodman, which often feature evidence of remixing. Spunk has also been the subject of several official releases. Virgin Records released the whole of Spunk, without the talking between tracks, along with several other early Sex Pistols demos as part of a limited edition double-CD reissue of Never Mind the Bollocks in 1996 called Spunk/This Is Crap. Spunk was released on 17 July 2006 by Sanctuary Records in its original vinyl format (CMQLP1395, limited to 1,000 copies). The CD version (CMRCD1376) included the three bonus tracks from the original No Future UK? bootleg. A Venezuelan bootleg album, Smilin' Ears, features the same tracks, except additional track of intro to \\"No Future\\" at the beginning of album. It is unnamed, consisting of \\"Nookie\\" backing speech of band members. The words spoken by Johnny Rotten are \\"I don't have any heroes, they're all useless. I don't need a Rolls Royce, I don't need a house in the country, I don't need a villa in the south of France. I'm happy as I am an' I'm gonna carry on\\". The recording was taken from a 1976 edition of the London Weekend Show hosted by Janet Street-Porter, which documented the rise of punk rock. ==Track listing== All songs written by the Sex Pistols, all songs on the original bootleg album were simply credited to \\"Spunk\\".

Robert Bemborough, the English captain of Plo√´rmel, who supported the rival claimant John de Montfort, was the nearest enemy leader. In 1351, Beaumanoir sent him a challenge, which resulted in an \\"emprise\\" ‚Äî an arranged chivalric combat ‚Äî which took place near Plo√´rmel, between picked combatants. Beaumanoir commanded thirty Bretons, Bemborough a mixed force of twenty Englishmen (including Sir Robert Knolles and Sir Hugh Calveley), six German mercenaries and four Breton partisans of Montfort. The battle, fought with swords, daggers, spears, and axes, mounted or on foot, was extremely vicious. When de Beaumanoir was badly wounded and asked for water, his fellow combatant Geoffroy du Bois is supposed to have said to him \\"Drink your blood, Beaumanoir; your thirst will pass\\" (Bois ton sang, Beaumanoir, la soif te passera). De Beaumanoir's men emerged victorious, and he became an icon of medieval chivalry. When his faction was eventually defeated at the Battle of Auray in 1364, de Beaumanoir helped to negotiate the Treaty of Gu√©rande, which ended the war, receiving in return the title of Marshal of Brittany. He married twice: first Tiphaine de Chemill√©, who gave him two sons, who died both childless, second with Marguerite de Rohan, daughter of Alain VII of Rohan and widow of Olivier de Clisson. They had three daughters married into the most prominent breton families of the time: Jeanne was the wife of Charles de Dinan, Lord of Montafilant and baron of Ch√¢teaubriant, Isabeau married Jean de Tournemine, Lord of La Hunaudaie, and Marguerite married Gallehaut de Roug√©, baron of Derval. ==Notes== Category:14th-century French people Category:1310 births Category:1360s deaths Category:Medieval French knights ","title":"Jean de Beaumanoir"},{"id":"5604969","text":"Archibald \\"Middenface\\" McNulty is a fictional character from the series Strontium Dog appearing in the British comic anthology 2000 AD, as well as his own spin-off series. He is a frequent companion of the series' star, Johnny Alpha. ==Plot== The story is set in 22nd-century Scotland, which has been warped by radioactive fallout where mutants are the underclass of future Britain. McNulty grew up in the Scottish mutant ghetto called Shytehill (a reference to Sighthill - the Scottish slang term for shit is 'shite'). Middenface gets his nickname from his signature mutation ‚Äì his skull is covered in hard, knobby bumps which range in size, number and density depending on the artist. Although this mutation is usually portrayed in the comics as purely cosmetic, there have been instances where Middenface shows to have an unnaturally hard skull. Either dealing blows with it or sustaining blows to it that would kill a normal man. Like all the members of the Search/Destroy agency he is a seasoned guerrilla fighter. He has had experience in fighting for his life, leading attacks, and defending himself and others against fanatical hatred and violence since the age of ten. He first appeared in Portrait of a Mutant, the Scottish leader of the rebels in the mutant war and an ally of a young Johnny Alpha. After the war, he became a Search Destroy Agent and first appeared in the present day in Outlaw; he appeared infrequently after this, and after the death of Johnny's partner Wulf Sternhammer, McNulty would become Johnny's new partner in many strips. Initially, he had a running gag of his Scottish dialect being incomprehensible to the English characters but this would be dialed down ‚Äì his hooligan ways would continue to be a source of humour though. In \\"The Life and Death of Johnny Alpha\\" in 2010, a retired Middenface was shown with a genuine drinking problem following Johnny Alpha's death. ==Young Middenface== Young Middenface was a long-running black and white strip featured in Judge Dredd Megazine. Alan Grant wrote and created the story. It was drawn by various artists, the last one being Shaun Thomas. Ellie De Ville provided lettering. The strip begins with a young, teenage McNulty as a juvenile delinquent on the streets of Shytehill. The story followshim in his path to becoming a mutant guerilla and eventually the leader, filling in the gaps before his debut in \\"Portrait of a Mutant\\". Forced into guerilla activism after becoming a fugitive, he becomes a highly violent and reckless soldier. The deaths of many of his friends fuel his hatred for the mutant-killing Kreeler police. Eventually, with the threat of the genocidal Sir William \\"Stinking Billy\\" Cumberland (the name and nickname of the Duke of Cumberland who crushed the 1745 Jacobite uprising in Scotland) becoming Head of Kreelers in Scotland, the Scottish Mutant Army launches an uprising. They overrun the Kreelers, capture multiple cities and then the Scottish Parliament building (still not fully paid for in the 2160s), but are unprepared when Cumberland simply blows up Parliament instead. Kreeler reinforcements forces the mutants into a retreat, making a last stand at Killoden theme park where they are massacred in their tens of thousands. On the back o this, Cumberland becomes First Minister of Scotland. Middenface and the surviving resistors continue to fight and at last succeed in assassinating Cumberland. The stories make use of Scots slang and dialect and the storylines often subtly (or otherwise) refer to contemporary Scottish politics, society and culture. \\"Brigadoom!\\" and \\"'Midnapped!\\", parody the musical Brigadoon and the classic Robert Louis Stevenson Scottish novel Kidnapped, but with twists. The mystical village of Brigadoom is made up entirely of cannibals led by Sawney Bean, who happen to break into song for no reason. ==Bibliography== As well as appearances in Strontium Dog (comics and audiodramas), he has also appeared in Strontium Dogs, Young Middenface, Dogbreath, and his own eponymous series in the Judge Dredd Megazine.

The HSS 1500 had an in-service speed of 40 knots (75 km/h). Several patents were registered to Stena Line in the development of the HSS, and four vessels were completed between 1996 and 1997. Stena Explorer, Stena Voyager and Stena Discovery were built to operate around the British Isles with Stena Carisma built for Scandinavian use. The newest of the craft was renamed HSS Discovery after being sold to a ferry company in Venezuela during 2009. Currently, none of the four craft originally commissioned by Stena Line operate.

In 2011, Stena Voyager was withdrawn from service on the Belfast-Stranraer route to be replaced by two chartered conventional ferries, MS Stena Superfast VII and MS Stena Superfast VIII. In 2015, Stena Explorer ceased to operate service between D√∫n Laoighaire and Holyhead. * HSS 1500 Stena Explorer: Holyhead‚ÄìD√∫n Laoghaire (Republic of Ireland), operated one round trip each day with a 2-hour crossing time. * HSS 1500 Stena Voyager: Stranraer‚ÄìBelfast (Northern Ireland), operated one round trip daily with a second on peak days, 2 hours 10 minutes. * HSS 900: Stena Carisma: Gothenburg (Sweden)‚ÄìFrederikshavn (Denmark) Up until November 2008 and as of August 2014 Stena Explorer had been making two return trips to Dublin per day, at a faster advertised speed of 99 minutes. Up until 2006, this had been three return services per day. Withdrawal of Stena Discovery in 2007 HSS 1500 Stena Discovery sitting just in front of the Dry Dock at Harland and Wolff ship yard in Belfast, April 2007 HSS 1500 Stena Discovery sitting at a mooring at Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast, April 2007 HSS 1500 Stena Discovery moored in Belfast, April 2007 Stena Discovery was taken off the Hoek van Holland‚ÄìHarwich route on 8 January 2007, with her final in- service trip being the 10:40 from Harwich, returning to her home port of Hoek van Holland. Taking a route via Dover and the Isle of Wight she arrived in Belfast, Northern Ireland on 24 January 2007, pending use as spare parts or possible sale. Any future use was still undecided, with Pim De Lange, Stena Line's director of North Sea operations saying that Stena Discovery had been returned to the care of Stena Ro Ro - the Swedish-based organization's chartering arm - but that it was unlikely any other northwest European company would want to operate her. The HSS service was replaced with twice daily - one day, one night - sailings on a pair of traditional super ferries. The Stena Hollandica and Stena Britannica vessels now accept foot-passengers and were each stretched to 240 metres in length at the Lloyd Werft shipyard in Germany in the spring of 2007. In addition to passenger traffic, the HSS service is believed to have been carrying around 25,000 units of freight per year - about 15% of the 165,000 units that Stena Line transport across the North Sea annually. The reasons cited for the replacement by conventional ferries were decreasing passenger patronage, coupled with escalating fuel costs. A report in International Freighting Weekly following the withdrawal stated that Stena Discovery operation on the North Sea route was using more fuel than Stena's seven other conventional ferries on the North Sea put together. Fuel costs for the HSS were noted in the article to have risen 40% from 2004‚Äì2005 and again by another 15% in 2005-2006, something that was \\"unsustainable\\". In 2009, the Stena Discovery was sold to the new Venezuelan company Albamar (which does business as 'Ferrymar'). Renamed HSS Discovery, the ship was purchased to operate a route between the ports of La Guaira, Estado Vargas and El Guamache, Estado Nueva Esparta (Margarita Island). The operation was more economical as, with Venezuela being an oil-producing country, the original problem of fuel costs ceased to exist. Stena Discovery was managed by Stena Northern Marine Management, who dry docked her in April 2009 for maintenance before sale to the Venezuelan company. On 29 September 2009 Stena Discovery finally left Belfast. Stopping off at Holyhead in North Wales to use the Stena Explorer's linkspan. This was to bring bunker fuel on board, she then finally left for South America on 1 October 2009. ==Timeline== * 1997 On 24 March Stena Explorer made a detour after departing D√∫n Laoghaire in order to pass close to Baily Lighthouse. Baily was the last manned lighthouse in Ireland and this day represented hand-over from keepers Eugene O‚ÄôSullivan and Anthony Burke to automatic remote operation. * 1997 Following her introduction that year, Stena Discovery was nicknamed The Wave Machine by locals around Harwich and Felixstowe. Certain critical ranges of speeds caused the HSS ship to produce breaking beach waves of up to 0.5m in height, often sweeping possessions around or knocking over fully-grown adults. Over the following two years, several changes to the HSS' Harwich approach route were undertaken along with strict guidelines to minimise the duration of time spent in the critical speed range between 16 knots-34 knots found to induce significant waves. Signs were erected along affected beach-fronts along with a warning siren on the approach of the HSS. * 1998 A year after Stena Carisma had been delivered, the presence of corrosion was detected at certain locations on the hull structure where welds joined aluminium alloy sections together. Stena AB were unhappy about this, but gaining compensation proved unsuccessful. In the time since delivery, the shipbuilder had gone bankrupt, the deadline for notifying the alloy supplier had passed and Stena's insurers, The Swedish Club, pointed out that Stena AB's \\"all risks\\" insurance excluded \\"constructional defects and rust/etching\\". Similar corrosion had been observed on other ships using the same alloy, so the fault was found to be in the choice of material used, rather than a defect of material itself. An adjuster delivered a final ruling in favour of the insurer‚Äîcorrosion was a \\"construction defect\\" and therefore exempt. The Det Norske Veritas safety authority had approved the supplier, but not the alloy in question. DNV subsequently approved the particular aluminium alloy, but only for use in moisture-free areas. * 2004 On 17 November Stena Carisma undertook a charter with the Swedish Infrastructure Minister, Ulrica Messing, to inaugurate new and upgraded marine fairways leading to Port of Gothenburg. * Early 2006 Stena Explorer and Stena Carisma received upgrades by fitting them with new Imtech N.V. UniMACS 3000 bridge navigation and control systems. The UniMACS 3000 system includes fifteen computers, five display screens and dual uninterruptible power supplies. Many of the components of the new system were installed in the electrical room below the bridge during a parallel testing, development and verification phase. The remaining two HSS ships were scheduled to receive their systems at the start of 2007. * 2009 On 6 October HSC Stena Voyager featured in filming for the BBC television series Top Gear. A Renault Twingo car was sunk into the wash behind the departing ferry. Incidents *In January 1998, Stena Discovery was travelling at full speed when she hit a 3.5m swell, resulting in water being pushed up over the nose and hitting the bridge windows. The swell ripped through the underside of the nose. It was later discovered that this was beyond Stena Discovery's design capability. Small air holes were fitted on the underside of the nose to prevent a repeat incident. * On 23 August 1998, Stena Discovery suffered berthing issues at Harwich on the incoming evening service. Docking should have taken place at 19:00, but passengers were off-loaded at 01:00 and sent to hotels before berthing with the Linkspan finally succeeded at 02:00. The 19:40 return trip to Hoek van Holland was cancelled, along with what would have been the 07:20 departure. The 10:40 service from Harwich was also cancelled and Stena Discovery returned to Hoek van Holland light. * On 15 March 2001, the driver of an 18-tonne lorry (loaded with 12 tonnes of fresh fish) failed to put his vehicle's handbrake on during a crossing of the Stena Discovery from Hoek van Holland to Harwich. As the ferry sped up, the lorry rolled back, crashed through the Discovery's rear doors, and plunged into the North Sea. It took along with it three smaller Ford Transit vans as well as one of the boat's rear doors. The vessel returned to Hoek van Holland and was taken out of service for repairs. Damage to the door and loss of the vehicles was estimated to be in the region of ¬£200,000. *On 20 September 2001, Stena Explorer suffered a generator fire in one of her pontoons. Whilst reversing to dock at her berth in Holyhead, a fire was detected in her auxiliary engine room in the port pontoon. Shortly after, the CCTV system normally used for visual docking cut-off. Knowing that just-completed checks showed that fire doors (lasting at least one hour) were closed, permission to shut off the engine in question was denied by the Master of the Ship until final approach line up with the Linkspan was confirmed. At this point the failing Cummins generator was shut-off. In lieu of the CCTV system, docking distances were relayed to the bridge by portable radio. Berthing was complete within 5 minutes of the original fire alarm and fresh water was taken on board to replenish the Hi-fog fire suppression system whilst all 551 passengers were safely off-loaded. The fire brigade attended and the Hi-fog water mist was deactivated at their request. A nine-month Marine Accident Investigation Branch investigation found the fault to be incorrect fitting of a compression- fitting used for a high-pressure fuel line leading to fuel spraying and igniting upon contact with the hot turbo-charger unit. * On 20 February 2007, a woman walking on the shore in Holywood, Northern Ireland claimed she and her two young children had almost been swept out to sea by a wave she believed was caused by a passing HSS ferry. * On 15 October 2007, fire broke out in a sealed turbine unit on board the Stena HSS Voyager en route from Stranraer to Belfast. 555 passengers and 46 crew were issued life jackets on the 0955 BST sailing. The fire was extinguished in less than an hour by an automatic system. Nobody was injured. The service continued to travel to Belfast and later services followed as normal after the vessel was checked by authorities. * On 28 January 2009, a lorry (carrying ferrous sulphate powder) managed to burst through Voyager's doors shortly after departure. Because of this, the ferry had to return to Stranraer. Subsequent sailings were postponed. The cause of the accident was the driver of the lorry failing to park it in gear and to apply the handbrake. The vehicle was insufficiently secured to the ship's deck. ==ReferencesExternal links== *The story behind the building of the first Stena HSS *Holyhead-Dun Laoghaire HSS Category:Ferries of the United Kingdom Category:Ships built in Finland Category:Ferry classes Category:High-speed craft ","title":"High-speed Sea Service"},{"id":"5605011","text":"Jared Brennan (born 28 July 1984) is a former professional Australian rules footballer, who last represented the Gold Coast Football Club in the Australian Football League (AFL).

Coach Leigh Matthews, switched him to the forward line in mid-2007, and against West Coast Eagles in Round 14, Brennan appeared to come of age, leading the charge with four goals. He followed it up with a personal record of 7 goals against the Collingwood Football Club in round 17.Lions notch record win Season 2008 was arguably Brennan's most consistent to date. Used predominantly as an impact player in the midfield, Brennan proved himself to be a capable clearance winner and played a decisive hand in several close victories. Brennan capped off his 2008 season with a top 5 placing in the 2008 Brisbane Lions club championship and selection in the Australian International Rules squad. Brennan is well known for his flashy, unorthodox playing style and his tendency to carry the ball in one hand. He is often compared to former Brisbane premiership player Darryl White due to a similar playing style and the ability to play different positions.

He is best known as a member of Duke Ellington's band, and as the co-writer of the jazz standards \\"Caravan\\", \\"Pyramid\\" and \\"Perdido\\". ==Biography== Tizol was born in Vega Baja, Puerto Rico. Music was a large part of his life from an early age. His first instrument was the violin, but he soon switched to valve trombone, the instrument he would play throughout his career. His musical training came mostly from his uncle Manuel Tizol, who was the director of the municipal band and the symphony in San Juan. Throughout his youth, Juan played in his uncle's band and also gained experience by playing in local operas, ballets and dance bands. In 1920, Juan joined a band that was traveling to the United States to work in Washington, D.C. The group eventually made it to Washington (traveling as stowaways) and established residence at the Howard Theater where they played for touring shows and silent movies. At the Howard they also were hired to play in small jazz or dance groups. This is where Tizol first came in contact with Edward Kennedy \\"Duke\\" Ellington. Tizol got the call to join the Ellington band in the summer of 1929. Arthur Whetsol, a trumpeter with whom Tizol played in the White Brothers‚Äô Band, apparently made the recommendation. Tizol sat beside Joe \\"Tricky Sam\\" Nanton in the two-man trombone section and became the fifth voice in the brass section of Ellington's orchestra. This opened up new possibilities for Duke's writing, as he now could write for trombones as a section instead of just having them play with the trumpets. Tizol's rich, warm tone also blended pleasingly with the saxophone section, so he was often scored carrying the lead melody with the saxes. Along with his distinctive sound, Tizol was also known for being one of the best sight-readers and overall musicians in the band. He played with great accuracy and was considered to be the solid rock of the trombone section. He was not a major improviser in the band, but he was often featured playing written out solos that displayed his masterful technique and agility on the horn. Tizol made many contributions to the Ellington band throughout the 1930s and 40s. One of his major roles in the band was copying parts from Ellington's scores. Tizol spent many hours and sometimes days extracting parts that needed to be written out for upcoming shows. Besides copying, Tizol was also a band composer. His best-known compositions, \\"Caravan\\" (1936) and \\"Perdido\\" (1941), are still played by jazz musicians today. Mercer Ellington stated that Tizol had invented the melody to \\"Caravan\\", from his days studying music in Puerto Rico; where they couldn't afford much sheet music so the teacher would turn the music upside down after they had learned to play it right-side up. This technique became known as 'inverting'. Tizol was responsible for bringing Latin influences into the Ellington band with compositions such as \\"Moonlight Fiesta\\", \\"Jubilesta\\", \\"Conga Brava\\", and others. He also played valide trombone. Tizol left Ellington's band in 1944 to play in the Harry James Orchestra. The main reason for this was to allow him to spend more time with his wife who lived in Los Angeles. In 1951, he returned to Ellington, along with James's drummer and alto saxophonist, in what became known as 'the James raid'. However, he returned to James' band in 1953 and remained predominantly on the West Coast for the remainder of his career. In Los Angeles he played sporadically with Harry James, Nelson Riddle, Louis Bellson and on the Nat \\"King\\" Cole's television show. Tizol returned very briefly to Ellington's band in the early 60s, but eventually retired in Los Angeles. He died of a heart attack at the age of 84 on April 23, 1984 in Inglewood, California, two years after the death of his wife, Rosebud.https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/26/obituaries/juan-tizol-dead-jazz- trombonist.html ==Discography== As sideman With Louis Bellson * Journey Into Love (Norgran, 1954) * Drumorama!

This sketch of a proof makes use of simple algebra only. This was the method by which Euler originally discovered the formula.

Similarly for the right-hand side the infinite coproduct of reals greater than one does not guarantee divergence, e.g., :\\\\lim_{n \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\left(1+\\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\right)^n = e . Instead, the denominator may be written in terms of the primorial numerator so that divergence is clear :\\\\frac{p_n\\\\\\\\#}{(p_n-1)\\\\\\\\#}= e^{-\\\\sum_{k=1}^n \\\\ln \\\\left(1-\\\\frac{1}{p_k}\\\\right)}=\\\\sum_{m=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{1}{m!}\\\\left(\\\\sum_{l=1}^\\\\infty\\\\sum_{k=1}^n \\\\frac{1}{lp_k^l}\\\\right)^m given the trivial composed logarithmic divergence of an inverse prime series. == Another proof == Each factor (for a given prime p) in the product above can be expanded to a geometric series consisting of the reciprocal of p raised to multiples of s, as follows :\\\\frac{1}{1-p^{-s}} = 1 + \\\\frac{1}{p^s} + \\\\frac{1}{p^{2s}} + \\\\frac{1}{p^{3s}} + \\\\ldots + \\\\frac{1}{p^{ks}} + \\\\ldots When \\\\Re(s) > 1, we have p‚àís < 1 and this series converges absolutely. Hence we may take a finite number of factors, multiply them together, and rearrange terms. Taking all the primes p up to some prime number limit q, we have :\\\\left\\\\zeta(s) - \\\\prod_{p \\\\le q}\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{1-p^{-s}}\\\\right)\\\\right < \\\\sum_{n=q+1}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{1}{n^{\\\\sigma}} where œÉ is the real part of s. By the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, the partial product when expanded out gives a sum consisting of those terms n‚àís where n is a product of primes less than or equal to q. The inequality results from the fact that therefore only integers larger than q can fail to appear in this expanded out partial product. Since the difference between the partial product and Œ∂(s) goes to zero when œÉ > 1, we have convergence in this region. ==See also== * Euler product * Riemann zeta function ==References== * John Derbyshire, Prime Obsession: Bernhard Riemann and The Greatest Unsolved Problem in Mathematics, Joseph Henry Press, 2003, ==Notes== Category:Zeta and L-functions Category:Article proofs Category:Leonhard Euler ","title":"Proof of the Euler product formula for the Riemann zeta function"},{"id":"5605082","text":":For 88.5 FM in Los Angeles, see KCSN KSBR is a non-commercial radio station in Mission Viejo, California, broadcasting to the Orange County, California area on 88.5 FM. KSBR airs an adult album alternative format branded \\"the new 88.5 FM\\". KSBR is a simulcast with KCSN in Northridge, California. ==History== KSBR signed on in 1975 as a Class D, 10-watt student-run station and a limited coverage area of only a few miles from the campus of Saddleback Community College. In 1979, with grants from CPB and NTIA, the signal was upgraded to a Class A, covering most of Orange County and the station signed on as Orange County's first National Public Radio affiliate with a staff of professional and student broadcasters. The program schedule at first employed an eclectic, free-form mix of rock music, drama and locally produced talk shows but, with a growing news and public affairs emphasis and a switch to an all jazz format, the station gained critical recognition and a growing audience. Budget cuts in 1984 returned KSBR to a student-run operation, most of the professional staff was laid off and the NPR membership was discontinued but the strong emphasis on jazz and public affairs continued. Since 1989, the station has hosted a fundraiser in May which they call the Birthday Bash. It draws top Jazz talent and has been held at various venues in Orange County over the years. For years, the station had a What's-playing-now page on the web. That contained a list of the previous 6 CDs played (promos were counted as items, as were songs). As of December 2016, that service has been eliminated. The call letters were previously used by an FM station in San Bruno, California, which operated at 100.5 MHz, from 1947 to 1959. The station was owned and operated by Eitel-McCullough, which moved to San Carlos, California in 1959 and merged with Varian Associates in 1965. \\"The New 88.5 FM\\" On September 6, 2017, Saddleback College and California State University, Northridge, owner of KCSN, announced the merger of their respective radio stations. The combined operation adopted the branding \\"The New 88.5 FM\\". On September 12 at 10 a.m. PDT, the FM and HD1 signals of both stations began simulcasting KCSN‚Äôs pre- existing \\"smart rock\\" AAA format, while KSBR‚Äôs jazz programming would move to their HD2 channels. KCSN‚Äôs Latin Alternative relocated to both stations‚Äô HD3 channels. On March 21, 2018, 88.5 FM announced that former KSWD (100.3 The Sound) radio personality Andy Chanley would host afternoon drive, taking over for Sky Daniels who continued as General Manager and Program Director. Prior to this, Chanley had guest hosted in Daniels‚Äô place for several weeks since January. ==Weekend programming== On weekends, the current schedule breaks from jazz/smooth jazz and airs programs such as The Whole 'Nuther Thing (free form eclectic), Kaleidoscope of Blues, Reggae Showcase, Folk Roots, bluegrass, old- timey, Celtic, The '80s Experience, and Making Your Memories (doo-wop and other music of the late 1950s/early 1960s). The Morning Breeze presents gentle, relaxing music (e.g. Enya) on weekend mornings. ==Previous logo== 150px == References  External links == *Official Website * SBR Category:Radio stations established in 1975 Category:Mission Viejo, California Category:1975 establishments in California ","title":"KSBR"},{"id":"5605084","text":"Ren√© Rodrigues Sim√µes (born December 17, 1952) is a Brazilian retired professional football manager. == Coaching career == Born in Rio de Janeiro, he guided Jamaica to the World Cup in France in 1998.

Merrett was born in Adelaide, but moved to the Gold Coast with his family at a young age. A talented schoolboy rugby player for Benowa State High School, he was identified as a potential Australian rules footballer by AFL Queensland junior development scouts due to his imposing frame and ball- handling skills, and was groomed as a key forward with the Southport Sharks. He was recruited by the Brisbane Lions with the number 30 draft pick in the 2002 AFL Draft but took several years to develop sufficiently to make his debut in Round 2, 2005 against Port Adelaide. In August 2016, he announced he would retire from the AFL at the end of the season. He has been an assistant coach of the Lions' AFL Women's team since the inaugural season in 2017, and coached a game against in round three of the 2020 season when regular head coach Craig Starcevich was hospitalised. The game ended in a draw. ==Positions== Merrett in December 2008 Daniel Merrett used to play as a full forward, centre half forward or half forward flank in his early career but now he regularly plays as a fullback.

It was released in July 1995 as the B-side to an unrelated track, \\"Born Slippy\\". The fragmented lyrics, by vocalist Karl Hyde, describe the perspective of an alcoholic. After it was used in the 1996 film Trainspotting, \\"Born Slippy .NUXX\\" reached number two on the UK Singles Chart. It has been named one of the best tracks of the 1990s by numerous publications. ==Writing== Vocalist Karl Hyde wrote the lyrics for \\"Born Slippy .NUXX\\" after a night drinking in Soho, London, hoping to capture the way a drunk \\"sees the world in fragments\\". The vocals were recorded in one take; when Hyde lost his place, he would sing the same line repeatedly, creating the line \\"lager, lager, lager, lager\\". Hyde, who was struggling with alcoholism, said he did not intend the song to be a \\"drinking anthem\\" but rather a \\"cry for help\\". He was disturbed when audience members raised their lager cans during performances. Underworld producer Rick Smith said the lyrics reflected \\"this energy of movement, and of time and place\\", like an abstract painting. == Release == Underworld released \\"Born Slippy .NUXX\\" as the B-side to an unrelated instrumental track, \\"Born Slippy\\", in July 1995. It became a hit after it was used in the 1996 film Trainspotting. Director Danny Boyle described it as the \\"heartbeat\\" of the film, capturing its \\"euphoric highs following intense lows\\". Underworld initially refused permission to use it in the film, as they disliked how often their music was used in negative portrayals of clubbing, but Boyle persuaded them after showing them a clip. Boosted by Trainspotting, \\"Born Slippy .NUXX\\" reached number two on the UK Singles Chart in 1996. Smith said he was shocked when BBC Radio 1 played the track on breakfast radio, and said: \\"I thought, music is moving, culture is moving, it's spreading. It's meaning things outside of just the context of on an amazing sound system in a club or on a PA system in a student hall. It was very nice!\\" == Legacy == AllMusic said wrote that \\"Born Slippy .NUXX\\" was \\"simply one of the best slices of electronica one will find. Musically austere in its emotional textures, the song becomes a nearly unstoppable force ... Dance music is rarely so artistic and enjoyable in the same instance.\\" Vice described \\"Born Slippy .NUXX\\" as one of one of the 90s' most iconic songs, writing that it \\"mixed sublime synths with a four-to-the-floor freakout, and represented everything that was going on; it was new.\\" In 2004, it was voted the fourth best dance track by readers of Mixmag. In 2014, NME named it the 261st greatest song of all time. Pitchfork named it the 31st best track of the 1990s. The Guardian called it, alongside the Chemical Brothers' \\"Setting Sun\\", the \\"most experimental and sonically extreme hit of the 90s\\". The Guardian also named it among \\"the weirdest chart [hits] of all time\\". For the film T2 Trainspotting (2017), Smith created a new version with timestretched chords, \\"Slow Slippy\\". He said in 2017, \\"We‚Äôve been playing 'Born Slippy' live for 20 years, and the reaction from the audience is so strong it‚Äôs almost overwhelming. It‚Äôs never got tiring to perform or play.

It has an institutional history as a coherent collection dating back to the mid-1920s, although its \\"core\\" collection dates from a library established by Ruth Cavendish Bentinck in 1909. Since 2013, the library has been in the custody of the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE), which manages the collection as part of the British Library of Political and Economic Science in a dedicated area known as the Women's Library. ==Collections overview== The printed collections at the Women's Library contain more than 60,000 books and pamphlets, more than 3,500 periodical titles (series of magazines and journals), and more than 500 zines. In addition to scholarly works on women's history, there are biographies, popular works, government publications, and some works of literature. There are also extensive press cutting collections. The Library's museum collection holds more than 5,000 objects, including over 100 suffrage and modern campaigning banners, photographs, posters, badges, textiles, and ceramics. There are more than 500 personal and organisational archives, ranging in size from one to several hundred boxes. In February 2007, the Women's Library collections were designated by the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council for their \\"outstanding national and international importance\\" (the Designation Scheme is now overseen by the Arts Council). In 2011, items from the women's suffrage archives held at The Women's Library were inscribed in UNESCO's UK Memory of the World Register as the \\"Documentary Heritage of the Women's Suffrage Movement in Britain, 1865‚Äì1928\\". ==History== London Society for Women's Suffrage/Fawcett Society The Women's Library traces its roots to the London Society for Women's Suffrage, a group established in 1867 to campaign for the right to vote. The \\"core\\" collection was the Cavendish-Bentinck library that was founded in 1909 by Ruth Cavendish Bentinck.Doughan, David, \\"Bentinck, Ruth Mary Cavendish- (1867‚Äì1953)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2006. Retrieved 25 November 2017. The collection was organised by the inaugural librarian, Vera Douie, who was appointed on 1 January 1926. At this time, and for many years afterward, it was called the Women's Service Library, in accordance with the name of the society which since the outbreak of World War I had been called the London Society for Women's Service. Douie remained in post for 41 years, during which time she took a small but interesting society library and turned it into a major resource with an international reputation. It was originally housed in a converted public house in Marsham Street, Westminster, which in the 1930s was developed into Women's Service House, a major women's centre within walking distance of Parliament. Members of the society and library included writers such as Vera Brittain and Virginia Woolf, as well as politicians, most notably Eleanor Rathbone. Woolf wrote about the Library to Ethel Smyth: \\"I think it is almost the only satisfactory deposit for stray guineas [money]\\". During World War II it suffered bomb damage, and the library had no permanent home until 1957, when it moved to Wilfred Street, near Victoria railway station. By this time, the society and library had changed their names to the Fawcett Society and the Fawcett Library, in commemoration of the non-militant suffrage leader Millicent Garrett Fawcett, and of her daughter, Philippa Fawcett, an influential educationist and financial supporter of the society. City of London Polytechnic/London Guildhall University/London Metropolitan University In the 1970s the Fawcett Society found it increasingly difficult to maintain the library. In 1977 it was taken over by the City of London Polytechnic, which in 1992 became London Guildhall University. The library subsequently spent nearly 25 years in a cramped basement increasingly liable to flooding, while increasing considerably its stock, its user base and its contacts with other such resources both nationally and internationally. It became increasingly apparent that these facilities were not adequate to store the collection, and a project was launched to improve the housing of the material and increase access to the library by members of the general public. In 1998 the Heritage Lottery Fund awarded a grant of ¬£4.2 million to the University for a new library building. The site chosen, in Old Castle Street, Aldgate, in the East End of London, used to be a wash house, a place of women's labour, and the architects maintained its facade. Changing its name from the \\"Fawcett Library\\" to the \\"Women's Library\\", the new institution opened to the public in February 2002. Its new purpose-built home by Wright & Wright Architects, encompassing a reading room with open stacks, an exhibition hall, several education spaces, and specialist collection storage, was the recipient of an award from the Royal Institute of British Architects. In August of the same year, London Guildhall University merged with the University of North London to become London Metropolitan University. Under the auspices of LMU, the Women's Library hosted a changing programme of exhibitions in its museum space; topics included women's suffrage, beauty queens, office work, 1980s politics, women's liberation, women's work and women's domestic crafts. Its exhibition and education programme on prostitution was long-listed for the 2007 Gulbenkian Prize. It held public talks, showed films, ran reading groups and short courses, offered guided tours, and worked with schools and community groups. Three individuals were recognised by the UK honours system for their work with the library: Vera Douie OBE; David Doughan MBE (Services to Women's Studies); and Jean Florence Holder MBE (for voluntary service to the Women's Library). London School of Economics Mary Robinson (former President of Ireland) and librarian Elizabeth Chapman at the opening of the new Women's Library reading room at LSE, 12 March 2014 In spring 2012, London Metropolitan University, arguing that too much of the library's usage came from outside the university, announced that it had decided to attempt to find a new home, owner or sponsor for the library's holdings, and threatened to reduce services to one day per week if such a sponsor could not be found. The University also hoped to convert the library building to house a lecture theatre. A Save the Women's Library Campaign was set up by the London Met branch of UNISON. It aimed to keep the Women's Library's collections intact, retain the expertise of its staff, and remain in its dedicated building. A petition opposing the curtailment or closure of the library ultimately attracted more than 12,000 signatures. It called the Women's Library \\"one of the most magnificent specialist libraries in the world\\" and a \\"national asset\\". The University invited bids from interested institutions, and the proposal of the London School of Economics (LSE) was found the most acceptable. It guaranteed to preserve, maintain and develop the collections as an individual entity within the British Library of Political and Economic Science, with a dedicated reading room and archival space. The LSE also offered continued employment to members of permanent staff who wished to remain with the library. The transfer became effective on 2 January 2013. The existing building was not handed over, but remained part of London Metropolitan University. ==Major collections== Personal archives held at the Women's Library include those of Lesley Abdela, Adelaide Anderson, Elizabeth Garrett Anderson, Louisa Garrett Anderson, Margery Corbett Ashby, Lydia Becker, Helen Bentwich, Rosa May Billinghurst, Chili Bouchier, Elsie Bowerman, Josephine Butler, Barbara Cartland, Jill Craigie, Emily Wilding Davison, Charlotte Despard, Emily Faithfull, Millicent Garrett Fawcett, Vida Goldstein, Teresa Billington-Greig, Elspeth Howe, Mary Lowndes (see also Artists' Suffrage League Papers), Constance Lytton, Harriet Martineau, Edith How-Martyn, Angela Mason, Hannah More, Helena Normanton, Eleanor Rathbone, Claire Rayner, Sheila Rowbotham, Maude Royden, Myra Sadd Brown, Nancy Seear, Baroness Seear, Elaine Showalter, William Thomas Stead, Mary Stott, Louisa Twining and Henry Wilson.

Oligomycin A is an inhibitor of ATP synthase. In oxidative phosphorylation research, it is used to prevent state 3 (phosphorylating) respiration. Oligomycin A inhibits ATP synthase by blocking its proton channel (Fo subunit), which is necessary for oxidative phosphorylation of ADP to ATP (energy production). The inhibition of ATP synthesis by oligomycin A will significantly reduce electron flow through the electron transport chain; however, electron flow is not stopped completely due to a process known as proton leak or mitochondrial uncoupling. This process is due to facilitated diffusion of protons into the mitochondrial matrix through an uncoupling protein such as thermogenin, or UCP1.

In the parashah, Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab, tries to hire Balaam to curse Israel, Balaam's donkey speaks to Balaam, and Balaam blesses Israel instead. The parashah constitutes The parashah is made up of 5,357 Hebrew letters, 1,455 Hebrew words, 104 verses, and 178 lines in a Torah Scroll (, Sefer Torah). Jews generally read it in late June or July. In most years (for example, 2018, 2019, 2021, 2022, 2024, 2025, and 2028), parashah Balak is read separately. In some years (for example, 2020, 2023, 2026, and 2027) when the second day of Shavuot falls on a Sabbath in the Diaspora (where observant Jews observe Shavuot for two days), parashah Balak is combined with the previous parashah, Chukat, in the Diaspora to synchronize readings thereafter with those in Israel (where Jews observe Shavuot for one day). The name \\"Balak\\" means \\"devastator\\",Francis Brown, S.R. Driver, and Charles A. Briggs, The New Brown-Driver-Briggs-Gesenius Hebrew and English Lexicon, pages 118‚Äì19.

Balaam Receiving Balak's Messengers (illustration from the 1890 Holman Bible) Balaam and the Angel (illustration from the 1890 Holman Bible) First reading ‚Äî Numbers 22:2‚Äì12 In the first reading (, aliyah), Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab, grew alarmed at the Israelites‚Äô military victories among the Amorites. He consulted with the elders of Midian and sent elders of Moab and Midian to the land by the Euphrates to invite the prophet Balaam to come and curse the Israelites for him. Balaam told them: \\"Spend the night here, and I shall reply to you as the Lord may instruct me.\\" God came to Balaam and said: \\"You must not curse that people, for they are blessed.\\" Second reading ‚Äî Numbers 22:13‚Äì20 In the second reading (, aliyah), in the morning, Balaam asked Balak's dignitaries to leave, as God would not let him go with them, and they left and reported Balaam's answer to Balak. Then Balak sent more numerous and distinguished dignitaries, who offered Balaam rich rewards in return for damning the Israelites. But Balaam replied: \\"Though Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not do anything, big or little, contrary to the command of the Lord my God.\\" Nonetheless, Balaam invited the dignitaries to stay overnight to let Balaam find out what else God might say to him, and that night God told Balaam: \\"If these men have come to invite you, you may go with them.\\" Balaam and the Ass (watercolor circa 1896‚Äì1902 by James Tissot) Balaam and the Angel (1836 painting by Gustav Jaeger) Third reading ‚Äî Numbers 22:21‚Äì38 In the third reading (, aliyah), in the morning, Balaam saddled his donkey and departed with the dignitaries, but God was incensed at his going and placed an angel in Balaam's way. When the donkey saw the angel standing in the way holding his drawn sword, the donkey swerved from the road into the fields, and Balaam beat the ass to turn her back onto the road. The angel then stationed himself in a lane with a fence on either side. Seeing the angel, the donkey pressed herself and Balaam's foot against the wall, so he beat her again. The angel then stationed himself on a narrow spot that allowed no room to swerve right or left, and the donkey lay down under Balaam, and Balaam became furious and beat the ass with his stick. Then God allowed the donkey to speak, and she complained to Balaam. And then God allowed Balaam to see the angel, and Balaam bowed down to the ground. The angel questioned Balaam for beating his donkey, noting that she had saved Balaam's life. Balaam admitted his error and offered to turn back if the angel still disapproved. But the angel told Balaam: \\"Go with the men. But you must say nothing except what I tell you.\\" So Balaam went on. Balak went out to meet Balaam on the Arnon border, and asked him why he didn't come earlier. But Balaam told Balak that he could utter only the words that God put into his mouth. Fourth reading ‚Äî Numbers 22:39‚Äì23:12 In the fourth reading (, aliyah), Balaam and Balak went together to Kiriath-huzoth, where Balak sacrificed oxen and sheep, and they ate. In the morning, Balak took Balaam up to Bamoth-Baal, overlooking the Israelites. Balaam had Balak build seven altars, and they offered up a bull and a ram on each altar. Then Balaam asked Balak to wait while Balaam went off alone to see if God would grant him a manifestation. God appeared to Balaam and told him what to say. Balaam returned and said: \\"How can I damn whom God has not damned, how doom when the Lord has not doomed? . . . Who can count the dust of Jacob, number the dust-cloud of Israel? May I die the death of the upright, may my fate be like theirs!\\" Balak complained that he had brought Balaam to damn the Israelites, but instead Balaam blessed them. Balaam replied that he could only repeat what God put in his mouth. Baal (14th‚Äì12th century BCE bronze figurine from Ugarit) Balaam Blessing the Israelites (illustration from the 1728 Figures de la Bible) Fifth reading ‚Äî Numbers 23:13‚Äì26 In the fifth reading (, aliyah), Balak took Balaam to the summit of Pisgah, once offered a bull and a ram on each of seven altars, and once again Balaam asked Balak to wait while Balaam went off alone to seek a manifestation, and once again God told him what to say. Balaam returned and told Balak: \\"My message was to bless: When He blesses, I cannot reverse it. No harm is in sight for Jacob, no woe in view for Israel. The Lord their God is with them.\\" Then Balak told Balaam at least not to bless them, but Balaam replied that he had to do whatever God directed. Sixth reading ‚Äî Numbers 23:27‚Äì24:13 In the sixth reading (, aliyah), Balak took Balaam to the peak of Peor, and once offered a bull and a ram on each of seven altars. Balaam, seeing that it pleased God to bless Israel, immediately turned to the Israelites and blessed them: \\"How fair are your tents, O Jacob, your dwellings, O Israel! . . . They shall devour enemy nations, crush their bones, and smash their arrows. . . . Blessed are they who bless you, accursed they who curse you!\\" Enraged, Balak complained and dismissed Balaam. Seventh reading ‚Äî Numbers 24:14‚Äì25:9 In the seventh reading (, aliyah), Balaam replied once again that he could not do contrary to God's command, and blessed Israelites once again, saying: \\"A scepter comes forth from Israel; it smashes the brow of Moab.\\" Then Balaam set out back home, and Balak went his way. While the Israelites stayed at Shittim, the people went whoring with the Moabite women and worshiped their god Baal- peor, enraging God. God told Moses to impale the ringleaders, and Moses directed Israel's officials to slay those who had attached themselves to Baal- peor. When one of the Israelites publicly brought a Midianite woman over to his companions, Phinehas son of Eleazar took a spear, followed the Israelite into the chamber, and stabbed the Israelite and the woman through the belly. Then the plague against the Israelites was checked, having killed 24,000.

I will build it firm as in the days of old, so that they shall possess the rest of Edom.\\" Numbers chapter 25 Professor Tikva Frymer- Kensky of the University of Chicago Divinity School called the Bible's six memories of the Baal-Peor incident in and a testimony to its traumatic nature and to its prominence in Israel's memory.Tikva Frymer-Kensky. Reading the Women of the Bible, page 215. New York: Schocken Books, 2002. . Phinehas confronted the Reubenites and Manassites (1984 illustration by Jim Padgett, courtesy of Distant Shores Media/Sweet Publishing) In the retelling of God destroyed all the men who followed the Baal of Peor, but kept alive to the day of Moses's address everyone who cleaved to God. Frymer-Kensky concluded that Deuteronomy stresses the moral lesson: Very simply, the guilty perished, and those who were alive to hear Moses were innocent survivors who could avoid destruction by staying fast to God. In Phinehas and ten princes of Israelite Tribes questioned the Reubenites‚Äô and Manassites‚Äô later building an altar across the Jordan, recalling that the Israelites had not cleansed themselves to that day of the iniquity of Peor, even though a plague had come upon the congregation at the time. Frymer-Kensky noted that the book of Joshua emphasizes the collective nature of sin and punishment, that the transgression of the Israelites at Peor still hung over them, and that any sin of the Reubenites and Manassites would bring down punishment on all Israel. In God recalled Israel's rebellion and God's resolve to pour out God's fury on them in the wilderness. God held back then for the sake of God's Name, but swore that God would scatter them among the nations, because they looked with longing at idols. Frymer-Kensky called Ezekiel's memory the most catastrophic: Because the Israelites rebelled in the Baal-Peor incident, God vowed that they would ultimately lose the Land that they had not yet even entered. Even after the exile to Babylon, the incident loomed large in Israel's memory.Tikva Frymer-Kensky. Reading the Women of the Bible, page 216. reports that the Israelites attached themselves to Baal Peor and ate sacrifices offered to the dead, provoking God's anger and a plague. reports that Phinehas stepped forward and intervened, the plague ceased, and it was reckoned to his merit forever. Frymer-Kensky noted that the like includes a savior, a salvation, and an explanation of the monopoly of the priesthood by the descendants of Phineas. Professor Michael Fishbane of the University of Chicago wrote that in retelling the story, the Psalmist notably omitted the explicit account of Phinehas's violent lancing of the offenders and substituted an account of the deed that could be read as nonviolent.Michael Fishbane.

Balaam and the Angel (illustration from the 1493 Nuremberg Chronicle) Numbers chapter 22 A Baraita taught that Moses wrote the Torah, the portion of Balaam, and the book of Job.Babylonian Talmud Bava Batra14b. Babylonia, 6th century. Reprinted in, e.g., Talmud Bavli. Elucidated by Yosef Asher Weiss; edited by Hersh Goldwurm, volume 44, page 14b3. Brooklyn: Mesorah Publications, 1992. . A Midrash explained that the Torah records Balaam's story to make known that because the nonbeliever prophet Balaam did what he did, God removed prophecy and the Holy Spirit from nonbelievers. The Midrash taught that God originally wished to deprive nonbelievers of the opportunity to argue that God had estranged them. So in an application of the principle of ‚ÄúThe Rock, His work is perfect; for all His ways are Justice,‚Äù God raised up kings, sages, and prophets for both Israel and nonbelievers alike. Just as God raised up Moses for Israel, God raised up Balaam for the nonbelievers. But whereas the prophets of Israel cautioned Israel against transgressions, as in Balaam sought to breach the moral order by encouraging the sin of Baal-Peor in And while the prophets of Israel retained compassion towards both Israel and nonbelievers alike, as reflected in and Balaam sought to uproot the whole nation of Israel for no crime. Thus God removed prophecy from nonbelievers.Numbers Rabbah 20:1. 12th century. Reprinted in, e.g., Midrash Rabbah: Numbers. Translated by Judah J. Slotki, volume 6, pages 786‚Äì87. London: Soncino Press, 1939. . Reading \\"And the Lord spoke to me, ‚ÄòDistress not the Moabites, neither contend with them in battle,‚Äô\\" Ulla argued that it certainly could not have entered the mind of Moses to wage war without God's authorization. So we must deduce that Moses on his own reasoned that if in the case of the Midianites who came only to assist the Moabites (in ), God commanded (in ), \\"Vex the Midianites and smite them,\\" in the case of the Moabites themselves, the same injunction should apply even more strongly. But God told Moses that his idea was incorrect. For God was to bring two doves forth from the Moabites and the Ammonites ‚Äî Ruth the Moabitess and Naamah the Ammonitess.Babylonian Talmud Bava Kamma 38a‚Äìb. Reprinted in, e.g., Talmud Bavli.

Brooklyn: Mesorah Publications, 2001. . Balaam and the Angel (illustration from the 13th Century Psalter of Louis IX of France) Classical Rabbinic interpretation viewed Balaam unfavorably. The Mishnah taught that Balaam was one of four commoners who have no portion in the World To Come, along with Doeg, Ahitophel, and Gehazi.Mishnah Sanhedrin 10:2. Land of Israel, circa 200 CE. Reprinted in, e.g., The Mishnah: A New Translation. Translated by Jacob Neusner, page 604. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1988. . Babylonian Talmud Sanhedrin 90a. Reprinted in, e.g., Talmud Bavli. Elucidated by Asher Dicker, Joseph Elias, and Dovid Katz; edited by Yisroel Simcha Schorr and Chaim Malinowitz, volume 49, page 90a7. Brooklyn: Mesorah Publications, 1995. . Following the teaching of Rabbi Joshua, the Gemara deduced from the Mishnah's statement that the gentile Balaam would not enter the World To Come, while other gentiles would. The Gemara read Balaam's name to demonstrate that he was \\"without a people\\" (belo am). Alternatively, the Gemara read Balaam's name to demonstrate that he \\"confused a people\\" (bilah am), namely the Israelites. Noting the similarity of Balaam's father's name Beor to the Aramaic word for \\"beast\\" (be‚Äôir), the Gemara read the allusion to Balaam's father in to demonstrate that Balaam committed bestiality. A Tanna taught that Beor was the same person as Cushan- rishathaim and Laban. As rishathaim means \\"two evils,\\" the Tanna deduced from the name Cushan-rishathaim that Beor perpetrated two evils on Israel ‚Äî one in pursuing Jacob in and the other by oppressing the Jews in . Noting that calls Balaam \\"the son of Beor\\" while says of Balaam \\"his son [was] Beor,\\" Rabbi Jo·∏•anan deduced that Balaam's father Beor was like his son (less able) in matters of prophecy.Babylonian Talmud Sanhedrin 105a. Similarly, the Mishnah taught that anyone who has an evil eye, a haughty spirit, and an over- ambitious soul is a disciple of Balaam the wicked, and is destined for Gehinnom and descent into the pit of destruction. The Mishnah taught that speaks of the disciples of Balaam when it says, \\"You, o God, will bring them down to the nethermost pit; men of blood and deceit shall not live out half their days.Mishnah Avot 5:19. Reprinted in, e.g., The Mishnah: A New Translation. Translated by Jacob Neusner, pages 608‚Äì09. An Angel Met Balaam with a Sword (illustration from the 1897 Bible Pictures and What They Teach Us by Charles Foster) Reading the description of \\"Balaam also the son of Beor, the soothsayer,\\" the Gemara asked why describes Balaam merely as a soothsayer when he was also a prophet. Rabbi Jo·∏•anan taught that at first, Balaam was a prophet, but at the end, he was merely a soothsayer. Rav Papa observed that this is an application of the popular saying that she who descended from princes and governors played the harlot with laborers (showing that she had no conception of the dignity of her beginnings).Babylonian Talmud Sanhedrin 106a. Reprinted in, e.g., Talmud Bavli. Elucidated by Asher Dicker, Joseph Elias, and Dovid Katz; edited by Yisroel Simcha Schorr and Chaim Malinowitz, volume 49, page 106a4. Interpreting the words, \\"And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed,\\" in a Tanna taught that there never was peace between Midian and Moab, comparing them to two dogs in a kernel that always fought each other. Then a wolf attacked one, and the other concluded that if he did not help the first, then the wolf would attack the second tomorrow. So they joined to fight the wolf. And Rav Papa likened the cooperation of Moab and Midian to the saying: \\"The weasel and cat had a feast on the fat of the luckless.\\" Balaam and the Angel (illustration from a 14th-century Spanish Bible (Biblia romanceada escurialense)) Noting that makes no mention of the princes of Midian, the Gemara deduced that they despaired as soon as Balaam told them (in ) that he would listen to God's instructions, for they reasoned that God would not curse Israel any more than a father would hate his son. Noting that in God told Balaam, \\"You shall not go with them,\\" yet in after Balaam impudently asked God a second time, God told Balaam, \\"Rise up and go with them,\\" Rav Nachman concluded that impudence, even in the face of Heaven, sometimes brings results. A Midrash taught that the words of \\"And God came to Balaam at night,\\" indicated God's distance from Balaam. Rabbi Leazar taught that the words of \\"The Lord is far from the wicked,\\" refer to the prophets of other nations. But the continuation of \\"He hears the prayer of the righteous,\\" refers to the prophets of Israel. God appears to nations other that Israel only as one who comes from a distance, as says, \\"They came from a far country to me.\\" But in connection with the prophets of Israel, says, \\"And the Lord appeared,\\" and says, \\"And the Lord called,\\" implying from the immediate vicinity. Rabbi Haninah compared the difference between the prophets of Israel and the prophets of other nations to a king who was with his friend in a chamber (separated by a curtain). Whenever the king desired to speak to his friend, he folded up the curtain and spoke to him. (But God speaks to the prophets of other nations without folding back the curtain.) The Rabbis compared it to a king who has a wife and a concubine; to his wife he goes openly, but to his concubine he repairs with stealth. Similarly, God appears to non-Jews only at night, as says, \\"And God came to Balaam at night,\\" and says, \\"And God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream of the night.\\"Genesis Rabbah 52:5.

Balaam and the Ass (1626 painting by Rembrandt) A Tanna taught in the name of Rabbi Simeon ben Eleazar that intense love and hate can cause one to disregard the perquisites of one's social position. The Tanna deduced that love may do so from Abraham, for reports that \\"Abraham rose early in the morning, and saddled his donkey,\\" rather than allow his servant to do so. Similarly, the Tanna deduced that hate may do so from Balaam, for reports that \\"Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his donkey,\\" rather than allow his servant to do so.Babylonian Talmud Sanhedrin 105b. Balaam and the Angel (1984 illustration by Jim Padgett, courtesy of Sweet Publishing) Reading a Midrash remarked on the irony that the villain Balaam was going to curse an entire nation that had not sinned against him, yet he had to smite his donkey to prevent it from going into a field.Numbers Rabbah 20:14. Reprinted in, e.g., Midrash Rabbah: Numbers. Translated by Judah J. Slotki, volume 6, page 799. The Mishnah taught that the mouth of the donkey that miraculously spoke to Balaam in was one of ten things that God created on the eve of the first Sabbath at twilight.Mishnah Avot 5:6. Reprinted in, e.g., The Mishnah: A New Translation. Translated by Jacob Neusner, page 686. Expanding on the Gemara reported a conversation among Balak's emissaries, Balaam, and Balaam's donkey. Balak's emissaries asked Balaam, \\"Why didn‚Äôt you ride your horse?\\" Balaam replied, \\"I have put it out to pasture.\\" But Balaam's donkey asked Balaam (in the words of ), \\"Am I not your donkey?\\" Balaam replied, \\"Merely for carrying loads.\\" Balaam's donkey said (in the words of ), \\"Upon which you have ridden.\\" Balaam replied, \\"That was only by chance.\\" Balaam's donkey insisted (in the words of ), \\"Ever since I was yours until this day.\\" The school of Rabbi Natan taught that the Torah contains an abbreviation in ‚ÄúAnd the angel of the Lord said to him: Why did you hit your donkey these three times? Behold I have come out as an adversary because your way is contrary (, yarat) against me.‚Äù The school of Rabbi Natan interpreted the word , yarat, as an abbreviation for, ‚ÄúThe donkey feared (, yare‚Äôah), it saw (, ra‚Äôatah), and it turned aside (, natetah).Babylonian Talmud Shabbat 105a.

Brooklyn: Mesorah Publications, 1996. . Numbers chapter 23 Rabbi Jo·∏•anan deduced from the words \\"and he walked haltingly\\" in that Balaam was disabled in one leg. Rabbi Jo·∏•anan interpreted the words \\"And the Lord put a word (or 'a thing') in Balaam's mouth\\" in to indicate that God put a hook in Balaam's mouth, playing Balaam like a fish. Similarly, a Midrash taught that God controlled Balaam's mouth as a person who puts a bit into the mouth of a beast and makes it go in the direction the person pleases.Numbers Rabbah 20:20. Reprinted in, e.g., Midrash Rabbah: Numbers. Translated by Judah J. Slotki, volume 6, pages 811‚Äì12. Rabbi Samuel bar Nahmani interpreted the words \\"that the Lord your God shall keep for you\\" in teaching that all the good that Israel enjoys in this world results from the blessings with which Balaam blessed Israel, but the blessings with which the Patriarchs blessed Israel are reserved for the time to come, as signified by the words, \\"that the Lord your God shall keep for you.\\"Deuteronomy Rabbah 3:4. Micah (watercolor circa 1896‚Äì1902 by James Tissot) The Gemara interpreted the words \\"knowing the mind of the most High\\" in to mean that Balaam knew how to tell the exact moment when God was angry. The Gemara taught that this was related to what Micah meant (in in the haftarah for the parashah) when he told the Israelites (quoting God): \\"O My people, remember now what Balak king of Moab devised, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him; . . . that you may know the righteous acts of the Lord.\\" The Gemara taught that by the words \\"that you may know the righteous acts of the Lord,\\" God meant to say to the Israelites, \\"You should know how many acts of charity I performed for you, in that I did not become angry all that time, in the days of wicked Balaam; for had I become angry at that time, no Israelite would have remained alive or been spared.\\" And the Gemara indicated that this is why Balaam told Balak in \\"How can I curse whom God has not cursed? or how shall I become angry, when the Lord has not become angry?\\" For Balaam knew that God was not angry at the Israelites. The Gemara thus concluded that for all of the time of the Balaam story, God had not been angry.Babylonian Talmud Sanhedrin 105b. See also Babylonian Talmud Berakhot 7a (attributing the interpretation of to Rabbi Eleazar.) The Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer taught that Balaam saw the wilderness filled with the Israelites' foreskins after they had circumcised themselves, and asked who would be able to arise by the merit of the blood of the covenant of this circumcision, which was covered by the dust, and thus in Balaam said, \\"Who can count the dust of Jacob?\\"Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer, chapter 28. Early 9th century. Reprinted in, e.g., Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer. Translated and annotated by Gerald Friedlander, page 212. London, 1916. Reprinted New York: Hermon Press, 1970. . The Gemara interpreted Balaam's words, \\"Let me die the death of the righteous,\\" in to foretell that he would not enter the World To Come. The Gemara interpreted those words to mean that if Balaam died a natural death like the righteous, then his end would be like that of the Jewish people, but if he died a violent death, then he would go to the same fate as the wicked. Rabbi Hiyya bar Abba taught in the name of Rabbi Jo·∏•anan that when in Balaam said, \\"Let me die the death of the righteous,\\" he sought the death of the Patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who were called righteous.Babylonian Talmud Avodah Zarah 25a.

Translated by Jacob Neusner, page 565. that a person should not construct a house so that its doorway opens directly opposite another doorway across a courtyard. Rabbi Jo·∏•anan taught that the words of \\"And Balaam lifted up his eyes and he saw Israel dwelling according to their tribes,\\" indicate that Balaam saw that the doors of their tents did not exactly face each other (and that the Israelites thus respected each other's privacy). So Balaam concluded that the Israelites were worthy to have the Divine Presence rest upon them (and he spoke his blessing in of the tents of Jacob).Babylonian Talmud Bava Batra 60a. The Gemara deduced from the words \\"the man whose eye is open\\" in which refer to only a single open eye, that Balaam was blind in one eye. Rabbi Abbahu explained how Balaam became blind in one eye. Rabbi Abbahu interpreted the words of Balaam's blessing in \\"Who has counted the dust of Jacob, or numbered the stock of Israel?\\" to teach that God counts the cohabitations of Israel, awaiting the appearance of the drop from which a righteous person might grow. Balaam questioned how God Who is pure and holy and Whose ministers are pure and holy could look upon such a thing. Immediately, Balaam's eye became blind, as attested in (with its reference to a single open eye).Babylonian Talmud Niddah 31a. Rabbi Jo·∏•anan taught that one may learn Balaam's intentions from the blessings of for God reversed every intended curse into a blessing. Thus Balaam wished to curse the Israelites to have no synagogues or school-houses, for \\"How goodly are your tents, O Jacob,\\" refers to synagogues and school-houses. Balaam wished that the Shechinah should not rest upon the Israelites, for in \\"and your tabernacles, O Israel,\\" the Tabernacle symbolizes the Divine Presence. Balaam wished that the Israelites' kingdom should not endure, for \\"As the valleys are they spread forth,\\" symbolizes the passing of time. Balaam wished that the Israelites might have no olive trees and vineyards, for in he said, \\"as gardens by the river's side.\\" Balaam wished that the Israelites' smell might not be fragrant, for in he said, \\"as aloes planted of the Lord.\\" Balaam wished that the Israelites' kings might not be tall, for in he said, \\"and as cedar trees beside the waters.\\" Balaam wished that the Israelites might not have a king who was the son of a king (and thus that they would have unrest and civil war), for in he said, \\"He shall pour the water out of his buckets,\\" signifying that one king would descend from another. Balaam wished that the Israelites' kingdom might not rule over other nations, for in he said, \\"and his seed shall be in many waters.\\" Balaam wished that the Israelites' kingdom might not be strong, for in he said, \\"and his king shall be higher than Agag. Balaam wished that the Israelites‚Äô kingdom might not be awe-inspiring, for in he said, \\"and his kingdom shall be exalted. Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said that all of Balaam's curses, which God turned into blessings, reverted to curses (and Balaam's intention was eventually fulfilled), except the synagogues and schoolhouses, for says, \\"But the Lord your God turned the curse into a blessing for you, because the Lord your God loved you,\\" using the singular \\"curse,\\" and not the plural \\"curses\\" (so that God turned only the first intended curse permanently into a blessing, namely that concerning synagogues and school-houses, which are destined never to disappear from Israel).Babylonian Talmud Sanhedrin 105b. Reprinted in, e.g., The Talmud: The Steinsaltz Edition. Commentary by Adin Steinsaltz (Even Yisrael), volume 21, pages 110‚Äì11. New York: Random House, 1999. . A Midrash told that when the Israelites asked Balaam when salvation would come, Balaam replied in the words of \\"I see him (the Messiah), but not now; I behold him, but not near.\\" God asked the Israelites whether they had lost their sense, for they should have known that Balaam would eventually descend to Gehinnom, and therefore did not wish God's salvation to come. God counseled the Israelites to be like Jacob, who said in \\"I wait for Your salvation, O Lord.\\" The Midrash taught that God counseled the Israelites to wait for salvation, which is at hand, as says, \\"For My salvation is near to come.\\"Exodus Rabbah 30:24. 10th century. Reprinted in, e.g., Midrash Rabbah: Exodus. Translated by S.M. Lehrman, volume 3, page 375. London: Soncino Press, 1939. . Moab Leads Israel into Sin (illustration from the 1728 Figures de la Bible) Numbers chapter 25 Rabbi Jo·∏•anan taught that wherever Scripture uses the term \\"And he abode\\" (, vayeishev), as it does in it presages trouble. Thus in \\"And Israel abode in Shittim\\" is followed by \\"and the people began to commit whoredom with the daughters of Moab.\\" In \\"And Jacob dwelt in the land where his father was a stranger, in the land of Canaan,\\" is followed by \\"and Joseph brought to his father their evil report.\\" In \\"And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of Goshen,\\" is followed by \\"And the time drew near that Israel must die.\\" In \\"And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his fig tree,\\" is followed by \\"And the Lord stirred up an adversary unto Solomon, Hadad the Edomite; he was the king's seed in Edom.\\"Babylonian Talmud Sanhedrin 106a. A Midrash taught that God heals with the very thing with which God wounds. Thus, Israel sinned in Shittim (so called because of its many acacia trees), as says, \\"And Israel abode in Shittim, and the people began to commit harlotry with the daughters of Moab\\" (and also worshipped the Baal of Peor). But it was also through Shittim wood, or acacia-wood, that God healed the Israelites, for as reports, \\"Bezalel made the Ark of acacia-wood.\\"Exodus Rabbah 50:3. Rabbi Judah taught that the words of \\"The counsel of the wicked is far from me,\\" refer to the counsel of Balaam, the wicked, who advised Midian, resulting in the death of 24,000 Israelite men. Rabbi Judah recounted that Balaam advised the Midianites that they would not be able to prevail over the Israelites unless the Israelites had sinned before God. So the Midianites made booths outside the Israelite camp and sold all kinds of merchandise. The young Israelite men went beyond the Israelite camp and saw the young Midianite women, who had painted their eyes like harlots, and they took wives from among them, and went astray after them, as says, \\"And the people began to commit whoredom with the daughters of Moab.\\"Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer, chapter 47. Reprinted in, e.g., Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer. Translated and annotated by Gerald Friedlander, page 369.

Commentary by Adin Even-Israel (Steinsaltz), volume 20, page 84. Jerusalem: Koren Publishers, 2015. . The Rabbis taught that if a witness accused someone of worshipping an idol, the judges would ask, among other questions, whether the accused worshiped Peor (as reports that the Israelites did).Babylonian Talmud Sanhedrin 40b. Reprinted in, e.g., The Talmud: The Steinsaltz Edition. Commentary by Adin Steinsaltz (Even Yisrael), volume 17, page 121. New York: Random House, 1998. . Rabbah bar bar Hana said in Rabbi Jo·∏•anan's name that had Zimri withdrawn from Cozbi and Phinehas still killed him, Phinehas would have been liable to execution for murder, and had Zimri killed Phinehas in self-defense, he would not have been liable to execution for murder, as Phinehas was a pursuer seeking to take Zimri's life.Babylonian Talmud Sanhedrin 82a. The Gemara related what took place after, as reports, \\"Moses said to the judges of Israel: ‚ÄòSlay everyone his men who have joined themselves to the Baal of Peor.‚Äô\\" The tribe of Simeon went to Zimri complaining that capital punishment was being meted out while he sat silently. So Zimri assembled 24,000 Israelites and went to Cozbi and demanded that she surrender herself to him. She replied that she was a king's daughter and her father had instructed her not to submit to any but to the greatest of men. Zimri replied that he was the prince of a tribe and that his tribe was greater than that of Moses, for Simeon was second in birth, while Levi was third. Zimri then seized Cozbi by her hair and brought her before Moses. Zimri demanded that Moses rule whether Cozbi was forbidden or permitted to Zimri. Zimri continued that if Moses were to say that Cozbi was forbidden to Zimri, then who permitted Moses to marry the Midianite woman Zipporah? At that moment, Moses forgot the law governing intimacy with an idolatrous woman, and all the people burst into tears, as reports when it says, \\"they were weeping at the door of the tent of meeting.\\" Interpreting the words, \\"And Phineas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw it,\\" in the Gemara asked what Phineas saw. Rav said that Phineas saw what was happening and remembered the law governing intimacy with an idolatrous woman, and asked Moses whether he had not taught that zealots may punish one who cohabits with an idolatrous woman. Moses replied that he who reads the letter should be the agent to carry out its instructions. Alternatively, Samuel said that Phineas saw that (in the words of ) \\"There is no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against the Lord,\\" which he interpreted to mean that whenever the Divine Name is being profaned, one may relax the general principle that one must defer to one's teacher ‚Äî the giver of wisdom ‚Äî and go ahead to make a legal decision in the presence of one's teacher. Rabbi Isaac said in Rabbi Eleazar's name that Phineas saw the Angel of Death wreaking destruction among the people, and (in the words of ) \\"he rose up out of the midst of the congregation, and took a spear in his hand.\\" Thus, Phineas must not have had his spear when he sat among the congregation, and from this we learn that one may not enter a house of learning with weapons. Reading the words of \\"When Phinehas the son of Eleazar, son of Aaron the priest, saw,\\" the Jerusalem Talmud asked what he saw. The Jerusalem Talmud answered that he saw the incident and remembered the law that zealots may beat up one who has sexual relations with an Aramean woman. But the Jerusalem Talmud reported that it was taught that this was not with the approval of sages. Rabbi Judah bar Pazzi taught that the sages wanted to excommunicate Phinehas, but the Holy Spirit rested upon him and stated the words of \\"And it shall be to him, and to his descendants after him, the covenant of a perpetual priesthood, because he was jealous for his God, and made atonement for the people of Israel.\\"Jerusalem Talmud Sanhedrin 9:7. Land of Israel, circa 400 CE. Reprinted in, e.g., The Jerusalem Talmud: A Translation and Commentary. Edited by Jacob Neusner and translated by Jacob Neusner, Tzvee Zahavy, B. Barry Levy, and Edward Goldman. Peabody, Massachusetts: Hendrickson Publishers, 2009. . The Gemara taught that Phineas then removed the point of the spear and hid it in his clothes, and went along leaning upon the shaft of the spear as a walking stick. When he reached the tribe of Simeon, he asked why the tribe of Levi should not have the moral standards of the tribe of Simeon. Thereupon the Simeonites allowed him to pass through, saying that he had come to satisfy his lust. The Simeonites concluded that even the abstainers had then declared cohabiting wit Midianite women permissible.Babylonian Talmud Sanhedrin 82a‚Äìb. Rabbi Jo·∏•anan taught that Phinehas was able to accomplish his act of zealotry only because God performed six miracles: First, upon hearing Phinehas's warning, Zimri should have withdrawn from Cozbi and ended his transgression, but he did not. Second, Zimri should have cried out for help from his fellow Simeonites, but he did not. Third, Phinheas was able to drive his spear exactly through the sexual organs of Zimri and Cozbi as they were engaged in the act. Fourth, Zimri and Cozbi did not slip off the spear, but remained fixed so that others could witness their transgression. Fifth, an angel came and lifted up the lintel so that Phinheas could exit holding the spear. And sixth, an angel came and sowed destruction among the people, distracting the Simeonites from killing Phinheas.Babylonian Talmud Sanhedrin 82b. The interpreters of Scripture by symbol taught that the deeds of Phinehas explained why directed that the priests were to receive the foreleg, cheeks, and stomach of sacrifices. The foreleg represented the hand of Phinehas, as reports that Phinehas \\"took a spear in his hand.\\" The cheeks' represent the prayer of Phinehas, as reports, \\"Then Phinehas stood up and prayed, and so the plague was stayed.\\" The stomach was to be taken in its literal sense, for reports that Phinehas \\"thrust . . . the woman through her belly.\\"Babylonian Talmud Chullin 134b. Based on and 11, the Mishnah listed the case of a man who had sexual relations with an Aramaean woman as one of three cases for which it was permissible for zealots to punish the offender on the spot.Mishnah Sanhedrin 9:6. Reprinted in, e.g., The Mishnah: A New Translation. Translated by Jacob Neusner, page 604. Babylonian Talmud Sanhedrin 81b. The Gemara asked whether the words in \\"And Eleazar Aaron's son took him one of the daughters of Putiel to wife\\" did not convey that Eleazar's son Phinehas descended from Jethro, who fattened (piteim) calves for idol worship. The Gemara then provided an alternative explanation: could mean that Phinehas descended from Joseph, who conquered (pitpeit) his passions (resisting Potiphar's wife, as reported in ). But the Gemara asked, did not the tribes sneer at Phinehas and question how a youth (Phinehas) whose mother's father crammed calves for idol-worship could kill the head of a tribe in Israel ‚Äî Zimri, Prince of Simeon ‚Äî as reported in See Babylonian Talmud Sanhedrin 82b and Sotah 43a. The Gemara explained that the real explanation was that Phinehas descended from both Joseph and Jethro. If Phinehas's mother's father descended from Joseph, then Phinehas's mother's mother descended from Jethro. And if Phinehas's mother's father descended from Jethro, then Phinehas's mother's mother descended from Joseph. The Gemara explained that implies this dual explanation of \\"Putiel\\" when it says, \\"of the daughters of Putiel,\\" because the plural \\"daughters\\" implies two lines of ancestry (from both Joseph and Jethro).Babylonian Talmud Bava Batra 109b‚Äì10a.

Ibn Ezra also noted that others said that \\"my end\\" repeats \\"let me die,\\" for Balaam knew that he would die by the sword.Abraham ibn Ezra. Commentary on Numbers 23:10. Reprinted in, e.g., Ibn Ezra's Commentary on the Pentateuch: Numbers (Ba- Midbar). Translated and annotated by H. Norman Strickman and Arthur M. Silver, page 196. Similarly, Nachmanides wrote that Balaam saw that the righteous would be inheritors of the Garden of Eden and life after death, and that Israel's \\"portion is in [eternal] life\\" (in the words of ) and not in Gehenna and destruction. Thus Nachmanides read Balaam's prophecy to say that God does not want the Jews to be cursed and their end will be good, according to the way of the righteous.Nachmanides. Commentary on the Torah. Jerusalem, circa 1270. Reprinted in, e.g., Ramban (Nachmanides): Commentary on the Torah: Numbers. Translated by Charles B. Chavel, volume 4, pages 268. New York: Shilo Publishing House, 1975. . And the early 14th century Spanish commentator Bachya ben Asher also read Balaam to wish for death, provided that his death would an eternal future like the Israelites, who Bachya saw as an integral part of God. Citing Ibn Ezra, Bachya noted that Balaam had foreseen a violent death by the sword for himself. Bachya read Balaam's prophecy to reveal that there is a world after death of the body consisting of disembodied souls, and that there is also a resurrection at a later time when these disembodied souls will be reunited with their former bodies. In Bachya's view, Balaam expressed the hope that when he died, his soul would qualify for immediate transfer to that world (and not to the place where his soul would be being judged). Bachya concluded that Balaam's wish for this kind of death and afterlife for himself was proof that he paid the Jewish people the greatest possible compliment.Bahya ben Asher.

Moses Maimonides Numbers chapter 25 Following the Mishnah (see ‚ÄúIn classical rabbinic interpretation‚Äù above), Maimonides acknowledged that based on Phinehas's slaying of Zimri, a zealot would be considered praiseworthy to strike a man who has sexual relations with a gentile woman in public, that is, in the presence of ten or more Jews. But Maimonides taught that the zealot could strike the fornicators only when they were actually engaged in the act, as was the case with Zimri, and if the transgressor ceased, he should not be slain, and if the zealot then killed the transgressor, the zealot could be executed as a murderer. Further, Maimonides taught that if the zealot came to ask permission from the court to kill the transgressor, the court should not instruct the zealot to do so, even if the zealot consulted the court during the act.Maimonides.

Spinoza concluded that other nations, like the Jews, thus had their prophets who prophesied to them. And Spinoza concluded that Jews, apart from their social organization and government, possessed no gift of God above other peoples, and that there was no difference between Jews and non-Jews.Baruch Spinoza.

Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing Company, second edition, 2001. . Professor Robert Alter of the University of California, Berkeley, observed that the Balaam narrative builds on repeated key words and actions, but repeats only certain phrases and dialogue verbatim. Alter pointed out that in Hebrew, the first word of the story in is the verb \\"to see\\" (), which then becomes (with some synonyms) the main Leitwort in the tale about the nature of prophecy or vision. In Balak saw what Israel did to the Amorites; in a vision in Balaam saw Israel below him; in his last prophecy in Balaam foresaw Israel's future. Balaam prefaced his last two prophecies with an affirmation in of his powers as a seer: \\"utterance of the man open-eyed, . . . who the vision of Shaddai beholds, prostrate with eyes unveiled.\\" Alter noted that all this \\"hullabaloo of visionary practice\\" stands in ironic contrast to Balaam's blindness to the angel his donkey could plainly see, until in God chose to \\"unveil his eyes.\\" Alter concluded that the story insists that God is the exclusive source of vision. Alter also noted reiterated phrase-motifs bearing on blessings and curses. In Balak sent for Balaam to curse Israel believing that \\"Whom you bless is blessed and whom you curse is cursed.\\" In God set matters straight using the same two verb-stems: \\"You shall not curse the people, for it is blessed.\\" In Balaam concluded: \\"From Aram did Balak lead me . . . : ‚ÄòGo, curse me Jacob, and go, doom Israel.‚Äô What can I curse that El has not cursed, and what can I doom that the Lord has not doomed?\\" Alter observed that Balaam was a poet as well as a seer, and taught that the story ultimately addresses whether language confers or confirms blessings and curses, and what the source of language's power is.Robert Alter. The Art of Biblical Narrative, pages 104‚Äì05. New York: Basic Books, 1981. . Professor Nili Sacher Fox of Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion noted that Balaam‚Äôs talking donkey, whom portrays as wiser than Balaam, is a jenny, a female donkey, perhaps reminiscent of the biblical personification of wisdom (, chochmah) as female in, for example, The Torah: A Women's Commentary. Edited by Tamara Cohn Eskenazi and Andrea L. Weiss, page 937. New York: Women of Reform Judaism/URJ Press, 2008. . Rabbi Diane Aronson Cohen of Temple Ohev Shalom in Colonia, New Jersey, wrote that the story of Balaam and his donkey in provides an important model of an abuser venting misdirected anger in verbal abuse and physical violence. Cohen noted that the recipient of the abuse finally decided that she had had enough and stopped the abuse by speaking up. Cohen taught that we learn from the donkey that if we are on the receiving end of abuse, we have an obligation to speak out against our abuser.Diane Aronson Cohen. \\"The End of Abuse.\\" In The Women's Torah Commentary: New Insights from Women Rabbis on the 54 Weekly Torah Portions. Edited by Elyse Goldstein, pages 301‚Äì06. Woodstock, Vermont: Jewish Lights Publishing, 2000. . Numbers chapter 23 Nehama Leibowitz contrasted God‚Äôs call of Israel‚Äôs prophets in and with Balaam‚Äôs preliminaries to communion with God in and . Leibowitz noted that Israel‚Äôs prophets did not run after prophecy, while Balaam hankered after prophecy, striving through magical means to force such power down from Heaven. Leibowitz marked a change in Balaam‚Äôs third address, however, when reports, ‚Äúthe spirit of God came upon him.‚ÄùNehama Leibowitz. Studies in Bamidbar (Numbers), pages 282‚Äì84, 286. Jerusalem: Haomanim Press, 1993. Reprinted as New Studies in the Weekly Parasha. Lambda Publishers, 2010. . Numbers chapter 24 Leibowitz contrasted how Israel's prophets continually emphasize the Divine authority for their messages, often using the phrase, ‚Äúsays the Lord,‚Äù while Balaam prefaced his two later utterances in with the introduction ‚ÄúThe saying of Balaam the son of Beor, and the saying of the man whose eye is opened.‚ÄùNehama Leibowitz. Studies in Bamidbar (Numbers), page 286. Numbers chapter 25 Professor Dennis Olson of Princeton Theological Seminary noted parallels between the incident at Baal-Peor in and the incident of the Golden Calf in as each story contrasts God's working to ensure a relationship with Israel while Israel rebels.Dennis T. Olson. Numbers: Interpretation: A Bible Commentary for Teaching and Preaching, pages 153‚Äì54. Louisville, Kentucky: John Knox Press, 1996. . Olson noted these similarities: (1) In both stories, the people worship and make sacrifices to another god. (2) Both stories involve foreigners, in the Egyptians‚Äô gold for the calf and and the women of Moab and Midian. 6. (3) In the aftermath of the Golden Calf story in God commands the Israelites to avoid what happens in making a covenant with the inhabitants, eating their sacrifices, and taking wives from among them who would make the Israelites‚Äô sons bow to their gods. displays this intermingling of sex and the worship of foreign gods, using the same Hebrew word, zanah, in (4) The Levites kill 3,000 of those guilty of worshiping the Golden Calf, and the Israelite leaders are instructed to kill the people who had yoked themselves to the Baal of Peor. (5) Because of their obedience in carrying out God's punishment on the idolaters, the Levites are ordained for the service of God, 29. and in the priest Phinehas executes God's punishment on the sinners, and a special covenant of perpetual priesthood is established with him. (6) After the Golden Calf incident, Moses ‚Äúmakes atonement‚Äù for Israel, and in the Baal Peor episode, Phinehas ‚Äúmakes atonement‚Äù for Israel. (7) A plague is sent as punishment in both incidents. Professor George Buchanan Gray of Mansfield College, Oxford, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, wrote that the Israelite men's participation in the sacrificial feasts followed their intimacy with the women, who then naturally invited their paramours to their feasts, which, according to custom, were sacrificial occasions. Gray considered that it would have been in accord with the sentiment of early Israelites to worship the Moabite god on his own territory.George Buchanan Gray. A Critical and Exegetical Commentary on Numbers: The International Critical Commentary, pages 381‚Äì82. Edinburgh: T. & T. Clark, 1903. Similarly, Professor Frymer-Kensky of Chicago University wrote that the cataclysm began with a dinner invitation from the Moabite women, who perhaps wanted to be friendly with the people whom Balaam had tried, but failed, to curse.Tikva Frymer-Kensky. Reading the Women of the Bible, pages 216‚Äì17. The Netziv Noting that the story of Baal Peor in shifts abruptly from Moabite women to the Midianite princess Cozbi, Frymer-Kensky suggested that the story may originally have been about Midianite women, whom Moses held responsible in Frymer-Kensky suggested that ‚ÄúMoabite women‚Äù appear in as an artistic device to create a symmetrical antithesis to the positive image of Ruth.Tikva Frymer- Kensky. Reading the Women of the Bible, page 257. The 19th century Lithuanian Rabbi Naftali Zvi Yehuda Berlin (the Netziv) wrote that in , in reward for turning away God's wrath, God blessed Phinehas with the attribute of peace, so that he would not be quick-tempered or angry. Since the nature of Phinehas's act, killing with his own hands, left his heart filled with intense emotional unrest, God provided a means to soothe him so that he could cope with his situation and find peace and tranquility.Naftali Zvi Yehuda Berlin. Ha'emek Davar (The Depth of the Matter). Valozhyn, late 19th century. Quoted in Nehama Leibowitz. Studies in Bamidbar (Numbers), page 331. Jerusalem: Haomanim Press, 1993. Reprinted as New Studies in the Weekly Parasha. Lambda Publishers, 2010. . Professor Tamara Cohn Eskenazi of the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion found the opening scene of disturbing for a number of reasons: (1) because the new generation of Israelites fell prey to idolatry within view of the Promised Land; (2) because God rewarded Phinehas for acting violently and without recourse to due process; and (3) because women receive disproportionate blame for the people's downfall. Eskenazi taught that God rewarded Phinehas, elevating him above other descendants of Aaron, because of Phinehas's swift and ruthless response to idolatry, unlike his grandfather Aaron, who collaborated with idolaters in the case of the Golden Calf. By demonstrating unflinching loyalty to God, Phinehas restored the stature of the priests as deserving mediators between Israel and God. Eskenazi noted that although God ordered death for all the ringleaders in Phinehas satisfied God's demand for punishment by killing only two leaders, thereby causing less rather than more bloodshed.The Torah: A Women's Commentary. Edited by Tamara Cohn Eskenazi and Andrea L. Weiss, page 963. ==Commandments== According to Maimonides and Sefer ha-Chinuch, there are no commandments in the parashah.Maimonides. Mishneh Torah.

Sefer HaHinnuch: The Book of [Mitzvah] Education. Translated by Charles Wengrov, volume 4, page 171. Jerusalem: Feldheim Publishers, 1988. . ==Haftarah== Yemen, 19th century) The haftarah for the parashah is When parashah Balak is combined with parashah Chukat (as it is in 2020, 2023, 2026, and 2027), the haftarah remains the haftarah for Balak. Connection between the haftarah and the parashah In the haftarah in Micah quotes God's admonition to the Israelites to recall the events of the parashah, to \\"remember now what Balak king of Moab devised, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him.\\" The verb that the haftarah uses for \\"answer\\" (, ‚Äòanah) in is a variation of the same verb that the parashah uses to describe Balaam's \\"answer\\" (, vaya‚Äòan) to Balaak in the parashah in and And the first words of Balaam's blessing of Israel in \\"how goodly\\" (, ma tovu), are echoed in the haftarah's admonition in of \\"what is good\\" (, ma tov) in God's sight, namely \\"to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God.\\" Micah (18th century Russian Orthodox icon in the Kizhi monastery, in Karelia, Russia) The haftarah in classical rabbinic interpretation The Gemara read the closing admonition of the haftarah, \\"\\"to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God,\\" as one of several distillations of the principles underlying the Torah. Rabbi Simlai taught that God communicated 613 precepts to Moses. David reduced them to eleven principles, as says, \\"Lord, who shall sojourn in Your Tabernacle? Who shall dwell in Your holy mountain? ‚Äî He who [1] walks uprightly, and [2] works righteousness, and [3] speaks truth in his heart; who [4] has no slander upon his tongue, [5] nor does evil to his fellow, [6] nor takes up a reproach against his neighbor, [7] in whose eyes a vile person is despised, but [8] he honors them who fear the Lord, [9] he swears to his own hurt and changes not, [10] he puts not out his money on interest, [11] nor takes a bribe against the innocent.\\" Isaiah reduced them to six principles, as says, \\"He who [1] walks righteously, and [2] speaks uprightly, [3] he who despises the gain of oppressions, [4] who shakes his hand from holding of bribes, [5] who stops his ear from hearing of blood, [6] and shuts his eyes from looking upon evil; he shall dwell on high.\\" Micah reduced them to three principles, as says, \\"It has been told you, o man, what is good, and what the Lord requires of you: only [1] to do justly, and [2] to love mercy, and [3] to walk humbly before your God.\\" The Gemara interpreted \\"to do justly\\" to mean maintaining justice; \\"to love mercy\\" to mean rendering every kind office, and \\"walking humbly before your God\\" to mean walking in funeral and bridal processions. And the Gemara concluded that if the Torah enjoins \\"walking humbly\\" in public matters, it is ever so much more requisite in matters that usually call for modesty. Returning to the commandments of the Torah, Isaiah reduced them to two principles, as says, \\"Thus says the Lord, [1] Keep justice and [2] do righteousness.\\" Amos reduced them to one principle, as says, \\"For thus says the Lord to the house of Israel, ‚ÄòSeek Me and live.‚Äô\\" To this Rav Nahman bar Isaac demurred, saying that this might be taken as: Seek Me by observing the whole Torah and live. The Gemara concluded that Habakkuk based all the Torah's commandments on one principle, as says, \\"But the righteous shall live by his faith.\\"Babylonian Talmud Makkot 23b‚Äì24a.

For parashah Balak, Sephardi Jews apply Maqam Mahour, the maqam that portrays emotional instability and anger. This maqam is similar to Maqam Rast in tune, except that it is higher in key. It is appropriate, because in this parashah, Balak became angered as the curses of Balaam turned into blessings.See Mark L. Kligman. \\"The Bible, Prayer, and Maqam: Extra-Musical Associations of Syrian Jews.\\" Ethnomusicology, volume 45 (number 3) (Autumn 2001): pages 443‚Äì479. Mark L. Kligman.

She was the youngest daughter of King Ferdinand VII of Spain and his fourth wife Maria Christina of the Two Sicilies, the queen-regent, who was also his niece. ==Biography== Heiress-presumptive Luisa Fernanda as a young girl, by Vicente L√≥pez Porta√±a, 1842. When her elder sister Isabella II of Spain succeeded to the throne, Infanta Luisa Fernanda was heiress-presumptive to the crown between 1833 and 1851, when Isabella's oldest surviving daughter was born. Marriage Luisa Fernanda was engaged to the Duke of Montpensier, the youngest son of King Louis Philippe, who also was Luisa's mother's first cousin. Luisa Fernanda, only 14 years old, and Antoine, 22, had their nuptials on 10 October 1846 as a double wedding with Isabella and Francis', and young Antoine was elevated to the rank of an Infante of Spain. The couple moved to Paris and later to Sevilla. The relationship between Isabella and her sister was tense, due to Antoine's conspiracies against the queen. Antoine's father was deposed in 1848. The same year, the then 16-year-old Luisa Fernanda gave birth to their first child, Maria Isabel. After Isabella was deposed, the family went into exile. Luisa returned to Sevilla years later, already widowed, where she died. She is buried at Escorial. ==Children== Infanta Luisa Fernanda with her husband Duke of Montpensier and four of their children. Luisa Fernanda and Antoine had nine children, but only five reached adulthood. * Infanta Maria Isabel (1848‚Äì1919), who married her first cousin Philippe, comte de Paris (1838‚Äì1894), the French claimant, and became known as Madame the comtesse de Paris.

Rider Haggard, the author of King Solomon's Mines and She. The book was first printed in 1889. The story is set in the Ptolemaic era of Ancient Egyptian history and revolves around the survival of a dynasty bloodline protected by the Priesthood of Isis. The main character Harmachis (the living descendant of the pharaoh's bloodline) is charged by the Priesthood to overthrow the supposed impostor Cleopatra, drive out the Greeks and Romans and restore Egypt to its golden era. As is the case with the majority of Haggard's works, the story draws heavily upon adventure and exotic concepts. The story, told from the point of view of the Egyptian priest Harmachis, is recounted in biblical language, being in the form of papyrus scrolls found in a tomb. Haggard's portrait of Cleopatra is quite stunning, revealing her wit, her treachery, and her overwhelming presence. All of the characters are mixtures of good and evil, and evoke both sympathy and loathing. While much of the material on ancient Egyptian ritual is overdone, the often brilliant dialogue and the fateful interactions between the principal characters make the book quite unforgettable in comparison to Haggard's better known but more conventional adventure novels. The character of Mark Antony, introduced in the later part of the book, is fleeting and lacks importance, though historically it seems that the book has some importance as the references made are based on facts about the romance between Cleopatra and Mark Antony and the fall of both from power.

The band, despite never achieving success outside the Netherlands, are now considered one of the most innovative acid rock bands from the era. They first used the name Klits, but were renamed Groep 1850 in 1966 when their debut single, \\"Misty Night\\" / \\"Look Around\\", appeared on the tiny Yep label. Though few copies were pressed, it established them as one of The Netherlands most original bands (alongside the Outsiders and Q65) and they soon signed to Philips. More singles ensued, in a highly psychedelic vein, including the \\"Mother No Head\\". Their debut album, Agemo's Trip To Mother Earth, appeared in late 1968. In The Netherlands its sleeve had a 3-D image on the cover, and came with a pair of 3-D glasses. A UK release (also on Philips) did not help the band gain a footing outside the Netherlands, and Philips dropped them soon afterwards. Their next album, Paradise Now, appeared on the Dutch Discofoon label in 1969 and was only marginally less acid-influenced than its predecessor. The band disbanded soon afterwards, but was sporadically active through the 1970s. Especially notable was another single, 1971's \\"Fire\\" / \\"Have You Ever Heard?\\", which appeared on Polydor.

Exceptions are where the path comes inland from Moel y Don by Plas Newydd estate, and the Bodorgan Estate on the west of the island between Aberffraw and Malltraeth, where Prince William and Princess Kate (Duke and Duchess of Cambridge) used to live. The loop officially begins and ends at Holyhead, and is described in the official guidebook in an anti- clockwise direction. It cost ¬£1.4 million and runs virtually within the length of the entire Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, using the existing network of public rights of way and some designated permissive paths. For example, the coastal path at Mynachdy is closed between mid-September and mid-February. There are alternatives to these permissive paths. The path is well signposted throughout. It has been walked in as little as four days, but around 7‚Äì10 days is a guideline for most walkers aiming to complete the whole path.

Siddhar Khan is the earliest available name associated with tabla that is found in historical records. Siddhar Khan, having been a pakhawaj player (hand drums player), was responsible for incorporating pakhawaj bols (syllables) to the style. However, the tabla, not the pakhawaj, is now the main instrument of the Delhi Gharana. Siddhar Khan and his descendants contributed greatly to the development of the Tabla language and compositional structures of the 'Peshkars' and the 'Kayadas'.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yx0LO281JNs, 'Tabla playing lessons described and made easy' of Delhi gharana on YouTube, uploaded 24 Feb 2014, retrieved 21 Feb 2016 ==Playing style== The Delhi tabla style is famous for its vast and rich repertoire of Kayadas.

It is home to 2,200-2,700 wolves which have been isolated from mixing with other wolf populations for over a century. They form the largest wolf population in Western Europe. Due to population controls and damages to livestock, Iberian wolves are, as of today, the only Western European subspecies of wolf whose hunting remains legal, yet only in Spain. Nonetheless, very few hunting permits are given every year, strictly north of the Douro river. Along with the difficulty of their hunt by virtue of their vigilant nature and the rarity of their sightings, they are strongly desired by many European hunters as a big-game trophy.

Some authors claim that the south-eastern Spanish wolf, last sighted in Murcia in the 1930s, was a different subspecies called Canis lupus deitanus. It was even smaller and more reddish in color, without dark spots. Both subspecies were nominated by the Spanish-born zoologist √Ångel Cabrera in 1907. The Iberian wolf's skull morphometrics, mtDNA, and microsatellites differ from other European wolves. In 2016, a study of mitochondrial DNA sequences of both modern and ancient wolves indicated that in Europe, the two most genetically distinct haplotypes form the Italian wolf, and separately, the Iberian wolf. The National Center for Biotechnology Information/Genbank lists the Iberian wolf under Canis lupus signatus. ==Description== White stripes on the snouts and black marks on the front legs are distinguishing markings of the subspecies Alpha male Iberian wolf with blood stains in its snout semi-captivity in the Community of Madrid Iberian wolf pups stimulating the alpha female to regurgitate Cabrera identified two types of wolves living in Spain. In comparison, C. l. lupus had a pale, undefined stroke on the cheek that contrasts with the white on the throat; C. l. signatus had a white stroke on the cheek that joins the white throat and with a reddish snout; and C. l. deitanus was much smaller and with more colouring than the wolves to the north. C. l. signatus is described as being 140-180 cm in head and body length, and 70-80 cm height at the shoulders. The Iberian wolf differs from the more common Eurasian wolf with its slighter frame, white marks on the upper lips, the dark marks on the tail, and a pair of dark marks in its front legs that give it its subspecies name, signatus (\\"marked\\"). The subspecies differentiation may have developed at the end of the Pleistocene Ice Ages due to the isolation of the Iberian Peninsula when glacier barriers grew in the Pyrenees and eventually reached the Gulf of Biscay in the west and the Mediterranean in the east. Males can weigh 30-50 kg, although up to 75 kg have been found. Females have dimensions and weight lower than those of males. ==Diet== The Iberian wolf lives in small packs. It is considered to be beneficial because it keeps the population of wild boars stable, thus allowing some respite to the endangered capercaillie populations which suffer greatly from boar predation. It also eats rabbits, roe deer, red deer, ibexes and even small carnivores and fish. ==Distribution and conservation== Wolf populations strongly declined across Europe during the 18th and 19th centuries largely due to human persecution, and by the end of the Second World War they had been eradicated from all of Central Europe and almost all of Northern Europe. Their population decline continued until the 1960s, with isolated populations surviving in Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece, and Finland. Wolf populations have commenced recovering naturally since then. Iberian wolf in Tudela de Duero, Spain The Iberian wolf consists of over 2,000 individuals in over 350 packs distributed across 140,000 km2. Their densities in some regions are among the highest in Europe, with up to 7 wolves/100 km2. In 2018, a study identified that this wolf could be categorised into 11 genetic groups. Four groups were identified in the Portuguese regions of Alto Minho, western Tr√°s-os-Montes, eastern Tr√°s-os-Montes, and one group located south of the Douro river. Seven groups were identified in the Spanish regions of western Galicia, eastern Galicia, western Asturias, central Asturias, easten Asturias, south-eastern Asturias, and Castilla y Le√≥n. In Portugal, the populations are small due to the destruction of habitat, loss of wild ungulates and the persecution by humans. Some Spanish naturalists and conservationists such as F√©lix Rodr√≠guez de la Fuente called for the end of the hunting and the protection of the animal. Today, the hunting of wolves is banned in Portugal, but allowed in some parts of Spain. The 2003 census estimated the total Iberian population to be 2,000 wolves. Wolves have been reported as returning to Navarre and the Basque Country and to the provinces of Extremadura, Madrid, and Guadalajara. A male wolf was found recently in Catalonia, where the last native wolf was killed in 1929. However, this animal was not a member of the Iberian subspecies, but an Italian wolf (C. l. italicus) migrating from France. As of 2013, an estimated 300 individuals remain in Portugal. In October 2013, Ecologists in Action called for an urgent review of the Iberian wolf census, which may overestimate their numbers. Later that month, wolf association Lobo Marley sent 198,000 signatures calling for the animal's protection to the European Parliament Committee on Petitions. Over a few weeks in September and October 2013, about 30 puppies and young wolves were killed by hunters in Asturias, Le√≥n, and Cantabria. Although hunting is banned in Portugal, about 45% of wolf deaths are due to human activities, including illegal hunting. Calling the rate unsustainable, 10 organisations signed a statement requesting stronger protection. Southern population Sierra Morena is a system of rugged mountain ranges in the south of the Iberian Peninsula where a very small wolf population has lived in isolation for half a century. A breeding pair of wolves was last sighted in 2013, however an extensive survey in 2016 could not find a breeding population. The DNA of a road-killed wolf from 2003 indicated high levels of inbreeding and 30% of the genome being that of dog. It is thought that as the population of these wolves declined, the inability to find a mate led to inbreeding and hybridization with dogs. The wolves in this region may now be extinct. Iberian wolf footprints in the snow ==2009 controversy== In 2009, a picture taken by a Spanish photographer of an Iberian wolf leaping over a cattle-pen in √Åvila won the prestigious Wildlife Photograph of the Year award. However, after rival photographers claimed that the image was that of a tame wolf, the jury opened an investigation and ultimately disqualified it.\\"Wildlife photographer of the year stripped of his award\\". The Guardian, January 20, 2019. The wolf was recognized as a tame one that could be rented from a center for the study of the Iberian fauna.Eduardo Su√°rez: \\"Retiran el premio a la foto del lobo del espa√±ol Jos√© Luis Rodr√≠guez\\".

Each cylinder advances by a single central stream of cytoplasm, granular in appearance, and has no subpseudopodia. This distinguishes them from other amoeboid groups, although in some members this is not the normal type of locomotion. ==Classification== This class was anticipated by some biologists like Jahn, who grouped all amoebae with granular pseudopodia together, but most split the lobose amoebae into testate Testacealobosia and naked Gymnamoebia. These latter arepolyphyletic, but molecular trees by Bolivar et al. identified a core monophyletic subgroup. Subsequent studies showed the testate lobose amoebae belong to the same group, which was thus renamed Lobosea sensu stricto or Tubulinea. Taxonomy Class Tubulinea Smirnov et al. 2005 stat. nov.

It represents Tagore's vision of a new and awakened India. The original poem was published in 1910 and was included in the 1910 collection Gitanjali and, in Tagore's own translation, in its 1912 English edition. Where the mind is without fear is the 35th poem of Gitanjali, and one of Tagore's most anthologised poems. It is an expression of the poet's reflective spirit and contains a simple prayer for his country, the India of preindependence times. ==Original Bengali Script== :‡¶ö‡¶ø‡¶§‡ßç‡¶§ ‡¶Ø‡ßá‡¶•‡¶æ ‡¶≠‡¶Ø‡¶º‡¶∂‡ßÇ‡¶®‡ßç‡¶Ø, ‡¶â‡¶ö‡ßç‡¶ö ‡¶Ø‡ßá‡¶•‡¶æ ‡¶∂‡¶ø‡¶∞ :‡¶ú‡ßç‡¶û‡¶æ‡¶® ‡¶Ø‡ßá‡¶•‡¶æ ‡¶Æ‡ßÅ‡¶ï‡ßç‡¶§, ‡¶Ø‡ßá‡¶•‡¶æ ‡¶ó‡ßÉ‡¶π‡ßá‡¶∞ ‡¶™‡ßç‡¶∞‡¶æ‡¶ö‡ßÄ‡¶∞, :‡¶Ü‡¶™‡¶® ‡¶™‡ßç‡¶∞‡¶æ‡¶ô‡ßç‡¶ó‡¶£‡¶§‡¶≤‡ßá ‡¶¶‡¶ø‡¶¨‡¶∏‡¶∂‡¶∞‡ßç‡¶¨‡¶∞‡ßÄ :‡¶¨‡¶∏‡ßÅ‡¶ß‡¶æ‡¶∞‡ßá ‡¶∞‡¶æ‡¶ñ‡ßá ‡¶®‡¶æ‡¶á ‡¶ñ‡¶£‡ßç‡¶° ‡¶ï‡ßç‡¶∑‡ßÅ‡¶¶‡ßç‡¶∞ ‡¶ï‡¶∞‡¶ø, :‡¶Ø‡ßá‡¶•‡¶æ ‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶ï‡ßç‡¶Ø ‡¶π‡ßÉ‡¶¶‡¶Ø‡¶º‡ßá‡¶∞ ‡¶â‡ßé‡¶∏‡¶Æ‡ßÅ‡¶ñ ‡¶π‡¶§‡ßá :‡¶â‡¶ö‡ßç‡¶õ‡ßç‡¶¨‡¶∏‡¶ø‡¶Ø‡¶º‡¶æ ‡¶â‡¶†‡ßá, ‡¶Ø‡ßá‡¶•‡¶æ ‡¶®‡¶ø‡¶∞‡ßç‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶∞‡¶ø‡¶§ ‡¶∏‡ßç‡¶∞‡ßã‡¶§‡ßá :‡¶¶‡ßá‡¶∂‡ßá ‡¶¶‡ßá‡¶∂‡ßá ‡¶¶‡¶ø‡¶∂‡ßá ‡¶¶‡¶ø‡¶∂‡ßá ‡¶ï‡¶∞‡ßç‡¶Æ‡¶ß‡¶æ‡¶∞‡¶æ ‡¶ß‡¶æ‡¶Ø‡¶º :‡¶Ö‡¶ú‡¶∏‡ßç‡¶∞ ‡¶∏‡¶π‡¶∏‡ßç‡¶∞‡¶¨‡¶ø‡¶ß ‡¶ö‡¶∞‡¶ø‡¶§‡¶æ‡¶∞‡ßç‡¶•‡¶§‡¶æ‡¶Ø‡¶º, :‡¶Ø‡ßá‡¶•‡¶æ ‡¶§‡ßÅ‡¶ö‡ßç‡¶õ ‡¶Ü‡¶ö‡¶æ‡¶∞‡ßá‡¶∞ ‡¶Æ‡¶∞‡ßÅ‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶≤‡ßÅ‡¶∞‡¶æ‡¶∂‡¶ø :‡¶¨‡¶ø‡¶ö‡¶æ‡¶∞‡ßá‡¶∞ ‡¶∏‡ßç‡¶∞‡ßã‡¶§‡¶É‡¶™‡¶• ‡¶´‡ßá‡¶≤‡ßá ‡¶®‡¶æ‡¶á ‡¶ó‡ßç‡¶∞‡¶æ‡¶∏‡¶ø, :‡¶™‡ßå‡¶∞‡ßÅ‡¶∑‡ßá‡¶∞‡ßá ‡¶ï‡¶∞‡ßá ‡¶®‡¶ø ‡¶∂‡¶§‡¶ß‡¶æ, ‡¶®‡¶ø‡¶§‡ßç‡¶Ø ‡¶Ø‡ßá‡¶•‡¶æ :‡¶§‡ßÅ‡¶Æ‡¶ø ‡¶∏‡¶∞‡ßç‡¶¨ ‡¶ï‡¶∞‡ßç‡¶Æ ‡¶ö‡¶ø‡¶®‡ßç‡¶§‡¶æ ‡¶Ü‡¶®‡¶®‡ßç‡¶¶‡ßá‡¶∞ ‡¶®‡ßá‡¶§‡¶æ, :‡¶®‡¶ø‡¶ú ‡¶π‡¶∏‡ßç‡¶§‡ßá ‡¶®‡¶ø‡¶∞‡ßç‡¶¶‡¶Ø‡¶º ‡¶Ü‡¶ò‡¶æ‡¶§ ‡¶ï‡¶∞‡¶ø, ‡¶™‡¶ø‡¶§‡¶É; :‡¶≠‡¶æ‡¶∞‡¶§‡ßá‡¶∞‡ßá ‡¶∏‡ßá‡¶á ‡¶∏‡ßç‡¶¨‡¶∞‡ßç‡¶ó‡ßá ‡¶ï‡¶∞‡ßã ‡¶ú‡¶æ‡¶ó‡¶∞‡¶ø‡¶§‡ß∑ ==English translation== Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high; Where knowledge is free; Where the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls; Where words come out from the depth of truth; Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection; Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way into the dreary desert sand of dead habit; Where the mind is led forward by thee into ever-widening thought and action‚Äî Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake. ==History and translation== This poem was most likely composed in 1900. It appeared in the volume Naivedya in the poem titled \\"Prarthona\\" (July 1901, Bengali 1308 Bangabda). The English translation was composed around 1911 when Tagore was translating some of his work into English after a request from William Rothenstein. It appeared as poem 35 in the English Gitanjali, published by The India Society, London, in 1912. p. 9 In 1917, Tagore read out the English version (then titled 'Indian Prayer') at the Indian National Congress session in Calcutta.Prabhat Kumar Mukhopadhyay, rabIndrajIbanIkathA, 1981, p.104 As in most of Tagore's translations for the English Gitanjali, almost every line of the English rendering has been considerably simplified. Line 6 in the English version omits a reference to manliness (‡¶™‡ßå‡¶∞‡ßÅ‡¶∑), and the stern ending of the original, where the Father is being enjoined to \\"strike the sleeping nation without mercy\\" has been softened.Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high; This poem often appears in textbooks in India and is also popular in Bangladesh. There is a Sinhala translation of this song by the name \\"Mage deshaya awadhi karanu mena piyanani\\" which was translated into Sinhala by Mahagama Sekara. A more recent translation by Niladri Roy (who also translated Sukumar Ray's Abol in its entirety), - much truer, literally, to the original Bengali verse - and which preserves the rhymes in the original Bengali verse, can be found in the attached image (used with permission from the translator) .

One day, an old woman came to them and begged that they feed her a fine meal. They did so, and the woman, being a fairy, promised that the next time they wished something without thinking of her, it would come true. For a long time, they could not make a wish without thinking of her, but one day, the king came by. The oldest daughter, Roussette, said that if she married the king's admiral, she would make sails for all his ships; the second, Brunette, that if she married the king's brother, she would make him lace enough to fill a castle; the third, Blondine, that if she married the king, she would bear him two sons and a daughter, who would have golden chains about their necks and stars on their foreheads, and jewels would fall from their hair. A favorite repeated their words to the king, who summoned the sisters, and soon the marriages were concluded. A splendid wedding feast appeared out of nowhere, served on golden dishes, and the women realized it was from the old woman. Roussette hid the dishes when they left, but they were turned to earthenware when she arrived. The king's mother was furious to hear that her sons had married such lowly women. Roussette was jealous of her sisters. Brunette gave birth to a son, and died. Blondine gave birth to two sons and a daughter, and the queen and Roussette put three puppies in their place. They took the children, including Brunette's, and gave them to a maid, who scrupled to kill them, but put them in a boat, with necklaces that might pay for their support if someone found them. The queen was sent back to her mother. The fairies guarded the boat until it fell in with a pirate ship. The captain brought them to his childless wife. When they found that jewels fell from the children's hair, the captain gave up his piracy, because he would be rich without it. They named the princess Belle- Etoile (French for \\"Beautiful Star\\"); her older brother, Petit-Soleil (\\"Little Sun\\"); her younger, Heureux (\\"Happy\\"); and their cousin, who did not have the chain or star but was more beautiful than his cousins, Ch√©ri (\\"Darling\\"). As Belle-Etoile and Ch√©ri grew up, they fell in love, but believing themselves brother and sister, deeply regretted it. One day, she overheard the pirate and his wife talking, and learned where they had come from. She told her brothers and cousin, and they told the pirate and his wife that they wished to leave. The pirate implored them to stay, but Heureux persuaded him that they wondered too much about their birth to endure it. They set sail in a marvelous ship. It arrived at the castle of the king their father, and the king marveled over them. They asked only for a house in which to stay. The Queen mother realized from the description that these were her grandchildren. She sent the maid who had failed to drown them, and the woman told Belle-Etoile that she needed the dancing water, which would keep her from ever looking old. She told that story, and Ch√©ri set out at once, against her will. He found a spring and rescued a dove from drowning. It set all sorts of animals that burrow to dig up the dancing water, and Ch√©ri returned with it. He freed the dove and it flew off rather sulkily. Princess Belle-Etoile rescues Prince Cheri, in an illustration by Walter Crane The maid came back with a tale of a singing apple, and Ch√©ri once again set out. This time, a reading stranger directed him to the apple, and by helping a wounded dove, he gained the knowledge of the dragon that guarded it, and how it could be frightened off by mirrors, and returned with the apple. The maid returned with a tale of a little green bird that knew everything. Belle-Etoile was deeply distressed by this, as she realized it could tell her who their parents were, and where they came from. Ch√©ri set out again, but when he had nearly reached the bird, the rock opened, and he fell into a hall and was transformed into stone. Belle-Etoile fell ill from her distress at his absence, and Petit-Soleil set out to find Ch√©ri, but suffered the same fate, and then Heureux did the same. Belle-Etoile set out after them, and rescued a dove from snow. It advised her not to climb the mountain where the bird perched, but to sing below it, and lure it down. She did so, and the bird advised her on how to free her brothers and all the rest of the prisoners. Meanwhile, the Queen Mother had persuaded the king to have his marriage to Blondine set aside, and marry again. Roussette persuaded the queen to invite Blondine to the wedding. The king invited the four children, and left a gentleman to await their arrival. The gentleman, on their arrival, told them the king's story. Belle-Etoile and her brothers arrived for the wedding, bringing their treasures, told how they were abandoned, and showed them to the king. Finally, the king asked the green bird who these children were, and where they came from. The bird proclaimed that they were the king's children and nephew. The Queen Mother, Roussette, and the maid were all punished, and instead of marrying himself, the king married his daughter Belle-Etoile to Ch√©ri. ==Legacy== As pointed by James Planch√©, author and dramatist who adapted several of MMe. d'Aulnoy's tales for the stage, the tale had remarkable similarities with Antoine Galland's The Sisters who envied their Cadette. He also noticed that the tale, when adapted to the English stage, renamed Prince Ch√©ri as Prince Cherry and Princess Belle-√âtoile as Princess Fair Star.Planch√©, James Robinson. Fairy Tales by The Countess d'Aulnoy, translated by J. R. Planch√©. London: G. Routledge & Co. 1856. pp. 616-617 and 619-620. ==Variants== \\"The Dancing Water, the Singing Apple, and the Speaking Bird\\", \\"The Wicked Sisters\\", and \\"The Tale of Tsar Saltan\\" include the three sisters' marriages, and the sisterly hostility, though it is unusual to see only one sister evincing it. (\\"The Three Little Birds\\" is even more unusual, in that the oldest sister is the heroine and victim of her sisters.) \\"The Bird of Truth\\" begins with the children already abandoned, through the hostility of nobles to a low-born queen, but follows the same plot thereafter. \\"The Water of Life\\" sends the children after the treasures while omitting the motive to be rid of them; they only wish to make their home pleasant, and the one who told them had no ulterior motive. The hostility from the mother-in-law is also found in \\"The Boys with the Golden Stars\\". It is a common motif in other fairy tales, not of this form: Perrault's version of \\"Sleeping Beauty\\", and \\"The Six Swans\\". ==ReferencesExternal links== *\\"Princess Belle-Etoile\\" in The Song of Sixpence, by Walter Crane, from Project Gutenberg *Edition of Princess Belle-Etoile at WalterCrane.com] Category:Works by Madame d'Aulnoy Category:French fairy tales Belle-Etoile Belle-Etoile Category:Piracy in fiction Category:Female characters in fairy tales ","title":"Princess Belle-Etoile"},{"id":"5605480","text":"Crystal structure of Œ≤-glucosidase from Thermotoga neapolitana (PDB: 5IDI). Thermostable protein, active at 80¬∞C and with unfolding temperature of 101¬∞C. Thermostability is the quality of a substance to resist irreversible change in its chemical or physical structure, often by resisting decomposition or polymerization, at a high relative temperature. Thermostable materials may be used industrially as fire retardants. A thermostable plastic, an uncommon and unconventional term, is likely to refer to a thermosetting plastic that cannot be reshaped when heated, than to a thermoplastic that can be remelted and recast. Thermostability is also a property of some proteins. To be a thermostable protein means to be resistant to changes in protein structure due to applied heat. ==Thermostable proteins== As heat is added, this disrupts the intramolecular bonds found in tertiary structure of proteins, causing the protein to unfold and become inactive. Most life-forms on Earth live at temperatures of less than 50 ¬∞C, commonly from 15 to 50 ¬∞C. Within these organisms are macromolecules (proteins and nucleic acids) which form the three-dimensional structures essential to their enzymatic activity. Above the native temperature of the organism, thermal energy may cause the unfolding and denaturation, as the heat can disrupt the intramolecular bonds in the tertiary and quaternary structure. This unfolding will result in loss in enzymatic activity, which is understandably deleterious to continuing life-functions. An example of such is the denaturing of proteins in albumen from a clear, nearly colourless liquid to an opaque white, insoluble gel. Proteins capable of withstanding such high temperatures compared to proteins that cannot, are generally from microorganisms that are hyperthermophiles. Such organisms can withstand above 50 ¬∞C temperatures as they usually live within environments of 85 ¬∞C and above. Certain thermophilic life-forms exist which can withstand temperatures above this, and have corresponding adaptations to preserve protein function at these temperatures. These can include altered bulk properties of the cell to stabilize all proteins, and specific changes to individual proteins. Comparing homologous proteins present in these thermophiles and other organisms reveal some differences in the protein structure. One notable difference is the presence of extra hydrogen bonds in the thermophile's proteins‚Äîmeaning that the protein structure is more resistant to unfolding. Similarly, thermostable proteins are rich in salt bridges or/and extra disulfide bridges stabilizing the structure. Other factors of protein thermostability are compactness of protein structure, oligomerization, and strength interaction between subunits.  Uses and applications   Polymerase chain reactions  Thermostable enzymes such as Taq polymerase and Pfu DNA polymerase are used in polymerase chain reactions (PCR) where temperatures of 94 ¬∞C or over are used to melt apart DNA strands in the denaturation step of PCR. This resistance to high temperature allows for DNA polymerase to elongate DNA with a desired sequence of interest with the presence of dNTP's.  Protein purification  Knowledge of an enzyme's resistance to high temperatures is especially beneficial in protein purification. In the procedure of heat denaturation, one can subject a mixture of proteins to high temperatures, which will result in the denaturation of proteins that are not thermostable, and the isolation of the protein that is thermodynamically stable. One notable example of this is found in the purification of alkaline phosphatase from the hyperthermophile Pyrococcus abyssi. This enzyme is known for being heat stable at temperatures greater than 95 ¬∞C, and therefore can be partially purified by heating when heterologously expressed in E. coli. The increase in temperature causes the E. coli proteins to precipitate, while the P. abyssi alkaline phosphatase remains stably in solution.  Glycoside hydrolases  Another important group of thermostable enzymes are glycoside hydrolases. These enzymes are responsible of the degradation of the major fraction of biomass, the polysaccharides present in starch and lignocellulose. Thus, glycoside hydrolases are gaining great interest in biorefining applications in the future bioeconomy. Some examples are the production of monosaccharides for food applications as well as use as carbon source for microbial conversion in fuels (ethanol) and chemical intermediates, production of oligosaccharides for prebiotic applications and production of surfactants alkyl glycoside type. All of these processes often involve thermal treatments to facilitate the polysaccharide hydrolysis, hence give thermostable variants of glycoside hydrolases an important role in this context. Approaches to improve thermostability of proteins Protein engineering can be used to enhance the thermostability of proteins. A number of site-directed and random mutagenesis techniques, in addition to directed evolution, have been used to increase the thermostability of target proteins. Comparative methods have been used to increase the stability of mesophilic proteins based on comparison to thermophilic homologs. Additionally, analysis of the protein unfolding by molecular dynamics can be used to understand the process of unfolding and then design stabilizing mutations. Rational protein engineering for increasing protein thermostability includes mutations which truncate loops, increase salt bridges or hydrogen bonds, introduced disulfide bonds. In addition, ligand binding can increase the stability of the protein, particularly when purified. There are various different forces that allow for the thermostability of a particular protein. These forces include hydrophobic interactions, electrostatic interactions, and the presence of disulfide bonds. The overall amount of hydrophobicity present in a particular protein is responsible for its thermostability. Another type of force that is responsible for thermostability of a protein is the electrostatic interactions between molecules. These interactions include salt bridges and hydrogen bonds. Salt bridges are unaffected by high temperatures, therefore, are necessary for protein and enzyme stability. A third force used to increase thermostability in proteins and enzymes is the presence of disulfide bonds. They present covalent cross-linkages between the polypeptide chains. These bonds are the strongest because they‚Äôre covalent bonds, making them stronger than intermolecular forces. ==Thermostable toxins== Certain poisonous fungi contain thermostable toxins, such as amatoxin found in the death cap and autumn skullcap mushrooms and patulin from molds. Therefore, applying heat to these will not remove the toxicity and is of particular concern for food safety. == See also == ;Thermophiles *Thermus thermophilus *Thermus aquaticus *Pyrococcus furiosus == References  External links == *Thermostability of Proteins Category:Protein structure Category:Toxicology Category:Extremophiles ","title":"Thermostability"},{"id":"5605489","text":"{ class=\\"infobox\\" style=\\"width: 25em; font-size: 90%;\\" - colspan=\\"3\\" bgcolor=\\"#FF0000\\"  center; font-size: larger;\\"  Zona Industrial - colspan=2 { width=100% style=\\"background: #f9f9f9;\\" - style=\\"vertical-align: center; text-align: center;\\" width=40%CDS Carrera 32 width=20%‚óÑ Troncal Calle 13-Am√©ricas ‚ñ∫ width=40%Carrera 43 } - Location Calle 13 between Carreras 38 and 42. - Neighborhood Puente Aranda - style=\\"vertical-align: center;\\" Opened 2003 - style=\\"vertical-align: top; text-align: center;\\" } The simple station Zona Industrial is part of the TransMilenio mass-transit system of Bogot√°, Colombia, which opened in the year 2000. ==Location== The station is located near downtown Bogot√°, specifically on Calle 13 between Carreras 38 and 42.

In the late 19th century and the early 20th century, record shops only sold gramophone records, but over the 20th century, record shops sold the new formats that were developed, such as eight track tapes, compact cassettes and compact discs (CDs). Today in the 21st century, record stores sell CDs, vinyl records and in some cases, DVDs of movies, TV shows, cartoons and concerts. Some record stores also sell music- related items such as posters of bands or singers and even clothing and items such as bags and coffee mugs. Even when CDs became popular during the 1990s, people in English-speaking countries still used the term \\"record shop\\" to describe a shop selling sound recordings such as CDs. With the vinyl revival of the 21st century, often generating more income than CDs, the name is again accurate. ==Modern era== United Kingdom Prior to the 2000s, more record shops were privately run, independent businesses, meaning that prices could differ from town to town and store to store. In the 2000s, record shops are largely chain-owned and thus prices are fairly similar in different towns. In the United Kingdom the national chain style of selling records and tapes developed with Our Price, itself originally a small independent business founded in the early 1970s that expanded nationwide. The current record store chains in the UK are HMV, Fopp, and Rough Trade. The enormous increase in sales of vinyl records in the 2000s has provided an opportunity for growth in some sectors. According to a recent study, Brighton, England has the highest number of record stores per 100,000 residents in the world. United States With the demise of chains such as Sam Goody and Tower Records in the 2000s, there remained no national retail chains focused on sales of recorded music except for FYE, although music sales continued in dedicated sections of video stores (until their demise) and at big box retailers such as Best Buy, Walmart and Target. Most record retailers today are independent retailers. ==History== Spillers Records in Cardiff, founded in 1894 by Henry Spiller, is reputed to be the oldest record shop in the world. It originally specialised in the sale of phonographs, cylinders and shellac discs. Shellac and then vinyl records were popular right up to the 1990s when CDs became the most popular form of recorded music. Soon, however, mail order and internet selling caused prices to fall, and with the advent of downloads and streaming, many record shops were forced to close. The vinyl revival has however increased income for record shops, and many new record shops and even chains of record shops have opened. Major chains in the UK and North America that have closed in recent years are Our Price, Zavvi, The Wherehouse, Andys Records, Music and Video Club and Media Play. HMV have closed all stores in North America and Ireland, although still present in the UK. Virgin Megastores have closed all stores in North America and Europe. Tower Records has closed all stores in North America. Rough Trade is, however, currently expanding, with two shops in London, one in Cambridge, one Megastore in New York and plans to further expand. Current record shop chains in Europe are now HMV (UK), Tower Records (Ireland), Free Record shop (Luxembourg: complete stores, Netherlands: shop-in shop), Velvet Music, Plato, (both Netherlands) and Golden Discs (Ireland). Record shop chains still present in North America include Sunrise Records (Canada), FYE, Sam Goody and Rough Trade (all USA). Outside of Europe and North America, the current record store chains include Virgin Megastores, HMV and Tower Records. The HMV Vault in Birmingham, England is now the world's largest record shop, opening its doors in October 2019. Before this, the former HMV in Oxford Street, London, England claimed to be the world's largest record store. The shop was originally opened in 1921 by the composer Sir Edward Elgar and had four floors of CDs, LPs, singles and DVDs. During the ‚Äò60s, the in-store recording studio was used by Brian Epstein to record the Beatles first demo. The revamped store was reopened in 2013 attended by many of the world's biggest stars including Paul McCartney, Robbie Williams and Elton John. The largest record shop in Ireland is Tower Records in Dublin, the largest in Asia is Tower Records, Shibuya Tokio, and the largest in the USA is Amoeba Records in Los Angeles. The largest record shop in the Nordic countries is Bengans in Goteborg, Sweden, which opened in 1974. In some countries, electronics stores and department store chains have very large, comprehensive CD departments which now also sell vinyl records. These include Saturn , Media Markt and Fnac (Europe) and El Corte Ingl√©s (Spain). Saturn in Cologne, Germany claims to now have the world's largest selection of records. The world's largest store selling records, CDs and other related and non-related products is Saturn in Hamburg, Germany. This former department store is the world's largest electronic retailer with 6 floors selling consumer products related to music and electric appliances including record players. Record stores played a vital role in African American communities for many decades. In the 1960s and 1970s, between 500 and 1,000 black-owned record stores operated in the American South, and probably twice as many in the United States as a whole. African American entrepreneurs embraced record stores as key vehicles for economic empowerment and critical public spaces for black consumers at a time that many black-owned businesses were closing amid desegregation.Joshua Clark Davis, \\"For the Records: How African American Consumers and Music Retailers Created Commercial Public Space in the 1960s and 1970s South,\\" Southern Cultures, Winter 2011 ==Used market== Second hand record store in Spain (2016)In addition to shops that sell new products, many record shops specialize in second hand, vintage or used collectible records, which they purchase from the public or other dealers, and sell for a profit. Some used record stores also sell used CDs and DVD movies. It is not uncommon for such shops to contain several items priced in the hundreds or thousands of US dollars (or local equivalent) due to their rarity, as well as items that are fairly common for much less. This type of record shop has also faced fierce competition from Internet sites like eBay, where people can sell their own records and avoid \\"the middle man\\". Some pawnshops sell used CDs. ==Independent stores== Although large stores like Walmart and Target Corporation have increased their record shelf space during the vinyl revival, most customers prefer to buy vinyl from small, independent record stores with a larger selection than department stores. In many countries including the UK and the U.S., the specialty record store business is booming with hundreds opening from 2013 to 2016. The County of Los Angeles currently has more independent record stores than any other county in the U.S. with over 50 stores ranging from Amoeba Music in Hollywood (which bills itself as the \\"world's largest independent record store\\") to The Record Parlour, the only record store where patrons can purchase, produce and perform music. ==See also== * Online music store * Record Store Day ==ReferencesFurther reading== *Joshua Clark Davis, \\"For the Records: How African American Consumers and Music Retailers Created Commercial Public Space in the 1960s and 1970s South,\\" Southern Cultures, Winter 2011 ==External links== * Worldwide record store directory * ","title":"Record shop"},{"id":"5605540","text":"Offside is a Scottish comedy football television show aired on BBC One Scotland and was presented by Scottish Football journalist Tam Cowan.

It is one of the very few Anglican churches dedicated to St. Augustine of Hippo. It is Grade II* listed. Edgbaston War Memorial, separately listed at Grade II, stands in the churchyard. It was erected in 1921 to commemorate the dead of World War I, and was subsequently modified to include those of World War II. ==History== The Lady Chapel with gothic tracery oak screen By 1851, houses had been built spasmodically along the Hagley Road as far as Rotton Park Road. Portland & York Roads were cut during this decade. As Edgbaston's population grew, the Church of England responded by building new churches and St. George's Church, Edgbaston, was consecrated in 1838 and St James's in 1852. In 1864, Joseph Gillott, the wealthy pen manufacturer, who was then resident in Westbourne Road, Edgbaston, discussed with J. A. Chatwin the location for a new church. Following an open competition, the design by J. A. Chatwin was chosen. Chatwin had suggested \\"forming an island site a short distance from the Hagley Road which should be approached by a straight road from that thoroughfare\\". This site was offered to the ecclesiastical authorities for a new church as existing church accommodation was inadequate for the population of 18,000. A Subscription Account raised ¬£9,000 (), for the building of a church dedicated to St Augustine of Hippo. The foundation stone was laid on 14 October 1867 and the body of the church, its chancel, nave and aisles were consecrated on 12 September 1868 by the Bishop of Worcester, Mervyn Charles-Edwards. The tower and spire, 185 feet high and the tallest in Birmingham, were added in 1876 at a cost of ¬£4,000 (),. The body of the church is in the Geometric Gothic style and has a striking painted chancel ceiling representing chapter 5 of the Book of Revelation and some very good stained glass by Hardman & Co. There is a wealth of stone carving inside, much of it by John Roddis, including a reredos with its representation of the Last Supper based upon Leonardo da Vinci's design, and unusual capitals on the nave pillars representing the four seasons and twelve months of the year. Just before the Second World War the South transept, underneath the tower, was cleared of pews to create a Lady chapel. This was given in memory of Benjamin Tilley (1851-1920) and his wife, Elinor G. Tilley (1855-1930) by their daughter, Elinor Mary Incledon (1878-1954). The Chapel is surrounded on two sides by a parclose screen, completed after the war, and carved partly in an Art Nouveau style by Robert Pancheri. A new baptistry created in the North transept in 1964 was designed by George Pace and a spacious narthex, designed by P. B. Chatwin (Chatwin's son), was added in 1968 to mark the church's centenary year. Incumbents * 1868-1903 The Reverend J. C.

Past Masters of Music have included Alfred Robert Gaul and Sir William Henry Harris. The composer Herbert Howells wrote his 'St Augustine's Service' for the choir in 1967. The choir performed this difficult piece for only the second time since 1967 on 13 October 2013, as part of the Dedication Festival of the church.

In addition to steam and electric locomotives, CLW also produced narrow gauge (762 mm) diesel locomotives of the ZDM class, meter gauge (1000 mm) diesel locomotives of the YDM class, and broad gauge hydraulic shunting locomotives of the WDS4 class. It also produced few special narrow gauge (2 ft, as in Darjeeling Himalayan Railway) diesel locomotives of the NDM class. Production of steam locomotives was discontinued in 1972 when the last steam locomotive, titled 'ANTIM SITARA' (The Last Star), was rolled out. Towards the early 1990s, production of diesel locomotives in CLW was discontinued altogether. Today, Chittaranjan is the largest maker of electric locomotives. The present staff strength of CLW is around 13,000 people making it the biggest unit of the Indian Railways. ==Infrastructure== According to the District Census Handbook 2011, Bardhaman, Chittaranjan covered an area of 19.65 km2.

Its historical name is Arzon (Greek: ŒëœÅŒ∂ŒøŒΩ). == Course == The Ra≈°ka originates from a strong well and several sinking streams flowing out from the cave south of the Sopoƒáani monastery, in the Pe≈°ter region. Waters of the well and the sinking streams flowing from the Ko≈°tan-Polje are gathered into the catchment which enabled construction of the small subterranean hydro electrical power plant Ras (6 MW).

The lower course is not densely populated, except for the villages of Po≈æe≈æina and Milatkoviƒáe.

Town of Novi Pazar was often being hit by sometimes catastrophic floods which caused a lot of damage. In 2010, the hydrology institute \\"Jaroslav ƒåerni\\" from Belgrade drafted a project for mini, anti-erosion dams on the river and its tributaries, and other anti-flooding measures. The project was green-lighted and the municipalities of Novi Pazar, Ra≈°ka and Tutin jointly began the construction. By 2013, 7 dams were built, which already proved useful during the 2014 floods. By 2018 additional 6 dams were built, lifting the total number to 13. In July 2018 additional 4 were under construction.  Batnjik floating dam  A floating dam which holds the plastic waste from the river was placed on the Ra≈°ka river in April 2017. It is a pilot project and first such a facility in Serbia. The dam is placed on the location in the Ra≈°ka municipality, but the closest settlement is the small village of Batnjik, which belongs to Novi Pazar. It soon got detached but was fixed again. After heavy rains in February 2018, in only 2 days, over 3 tons of plastic waste was held by the dam. The plastic is being baled and sent to recycling. The authorities in Novi Pazar which, as a large settlement, pollutes the Ra≈°ka river the most, expressed interest in placing several other floating dams on the river on their territory, while the state government announced that if the project is successful, such dams will be placed all over Serbia. == References  Sources == * Mala Prosvetina Enciklopedija, Third edition (1985); Prosveta; * Jovan ƒê.

The San Pedro Springs also feed into the San Antonio River. ==Geography== The San Antonio Springs are located about three miles (5 km) north of Downtown San Antonio; most are now on the property of the University of the Incarnate Word in the Midtown Brackenridge district of San Antonio. The springs are fed by water from the Edwards Aquifer; this water reaches the surface through faults along the Balcones Escarpment. There have been more than 100 individual springs identified, but many of these are no longer active due to pumping demands on the Edwards Aquifer and sedimentation from the upstream Olmos Creek. During periods of drought, the springs sometimes stop flowing entirely, only to resume when water levels rise in the aquifer. The mean flow from the springs is 20 ft¬≥/s (0.6 m¬≥/s). ==History== Artifacts from Paleo-Indian cultures have been found at the site of the San Antonio Springs; some of these artifacts are more than 11,000 years old. The earliest Europeans found up to 200 sub-bands of Coahuiltecan Indians in the vicinity of the springs; however, they were soon displaced by the Lipan Apaches. Spanish missionaries built a system of aqueducts and ditches to carry water from the springs to the local missions, including The Alamo. By the Civil War, the springs had become contaminated.

() is a biopharmaceutical research and development oncology company based in Los Angeles, California. The CytRx oncology pipeline includes clinical trials involving their lead drug aldoxorubicin. Aldoxorubicin (formerly INNO-206) is a modified form of doxorubicin, the popular anthracycline chemotherapeutic agent known as \\"red death\\". Anthracyclines are a class of drugs that are among the most commonly used agents in the treatment of cancer. Doxorubicin, the first anthracycline to gain approval, has demonstrated efficacy in a wide variety of cancers including breast cancer, lung cancer, sarcomas, and lymphomas. However, doxorubicin is associated with side effects such as myelosuppression, gastrointestinal disorders, mucositis, stomatitis, cumulative cardiotoxicity and extravasation. ==General== CytRx plans to expand its pipeline of oncology candidates at its laboratory facilities in Freiburg, Germany, based on novel linker technologies that can be utilized with multiple chemotherapeutic agents and may allow for greater concentration of drug at tumor sites. The corporate website is http://www.cytrx.com/aldoxorubicin Steven Arthur Kriegsman is the President and CEO. ==Aldoxorubicin== Aldoxorubicin (formerly INNO-206) is a tumor- targeted doxorubicin conjugate. Specifically, it is the (6-Maleimidocaproyl) hydrazone of doxorubicin. Essentially, this chemical name describes doxorubicin (DOXO) attached to an acid sensitive linker (EMCH). Completed preclinical and clinical trials (see below) indicate that this novel agent has attributes that improve on native doxorubicin including reduction of adverse events, improvement in efficacy and the ability to reach the tumor more quickly. CytRx has outlicensed aldoxorubicin to NantCell as of 2017. ==Stock promotion== In 2014 CytRx was involved in a stock promotion scheme, paying DreamTeamGroup to write at least 13 articles that appeared on Seeking Alpha, Forbes.com, Motley Fool, and Cheat Sheet. The articles carried no conflict of interest disclosure, and were reviewed and edited by CytRx management. The stock price doubled following the articles. The articles and author profile pages (including pseudonyms) were removed after investigation by CNNMoney. A class action lawsuit has been filed against CytRx. The events leading to CytRx lawsuits were revealed by a Seeking Alpha author named Richard Pearson who was shorting the CytRx company stock and the \\"short attack\\" was revealed by another Seeking Alpha author PhD. who wrote about the science of aldoxorubicin and revealed the motives behind Richard Pearson's article to short the company's stock.

She authored memoirs that were controversial for their critical perspective and allegations about the political policies of various Spanish and foreign governments. ==Early life== Eulalia was born on 12 February 1864 in the Royal Palace of Madrid, the youngest of the five children born to Isabella II during her marriage to Francis de Assisi de Borb√≥n, Duke of Cadiz who survived to adulthood. She was baptised on 14 February 1864 with the names Mar√≠a Eulalia Francisca de As√≠s Margarita Roberta Isabel Francisca de Paula Cristina Mar√≠a de la Piedad. Her godparents were Robert I, Duke of Parma, and his sister Princess Margherita.\\"Foreign Intelligence, Spain\\", The Times ( 19 February 1864): 5. In 1868, Eulalia and her family were forced to leave Spain in the wake of the revolution. They lived in Paris, where Eulalia was educated. She received her first communion in Rome from Pope Pius IX. In 1874, Eulalia's brother Alfonso was restored to the throne in place of their mother Queen Isabella II. Three years later, Eulalia returned to Spain. She lived at first in El Escorial with her mother, but later moved to the Alc√°zar of Seville and then to Madrid. ==Marriage and children== On 6 March 1886, at Madrid, Eulalia married her first cousin Infante Antonio de Orl√©ans y Borb√≥n, Duke di Galliera, son of Antoine, Duke of Montpensier, and his wife, Infanta Luisa Fernanda of Spain.The Times ( 8 March 1886): 5. The officiant was Cardinal Zeferino Gonz√°lez y D√≠az Tu√±√≥n, Archbishop of Seville. The wedding was delayed several months on account of the death of Eulalia's brother, King Alfonso XII. Eulalia and Antonio spent their honeymoon at the Palacio Real de Aranjuez. Eulalia and Antonio had two sons: * Infante Alfonso, Duke of Galliera (1886‚Äì1975) * Luis Fernando de Orleans y Borb√≥n (1888‚Äì1945) After the birth of her younger son, Eulalia lived apart from her husband. She maintained residences in Spain and Paris and visited England frequently. ==Visit to the United States== In May 1893 Eulalia visited the United States; her controversial visit to the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago was particularly well-documented. She traveled first to Puerto Rico,\\"Cartas a Isabel II, 1893: Mi viaje a Cuba y Estados Unidos\\" by Eulalia de Borb√≥n, Infanta de Espa√±a, pgs. 30‚Äì33. then to Havana, Cuba,\\"Court Circular\\", The Times ( 10 May 1893): 5., and arrived in New York on the 18 of May on the Spanish cruiser Infanta Isabel, before making her way to Washington, D.C., where she was received by President Grover Cleveland at the White House.The Times ( 22 May 1893): 7. She then proceeded to New York City.\\"Court Circular\\", The Times ( 30 May 1832): 9. Eulalia was later admitted to membership in the Daughters of the American Revolution as a descendant of King Charles III of Spain. ==Publications== Eulalia was the author of several works that were controversial within royal circles, although she never ceased to have frequent contact with her relatives both in Spain and elsewhere. In 1912, under the pseudonym Comtesse de Avila, Eulalia wrote Au fil de la vie (Paris: Soci√©t√© fran√ßaise d'Imprimerie et de Librarie, 1911), translated into English as The Thread of Life (New York: Duffield, 1912).\\"King Alfonso and His Aunt\\", The Times ( 4 December 1912): 9; \\"Princess Eulalia's Book\\", The Times ( 6 December 1912): 5; \\"The Infanta Eulalia\\", The Times ( 8 December 1912): 5. The book expressed Eulalia's thoughts about education, the independence of women, the equality of classes, socialism, religion, marriage, prejudices, and traditions. Her nephew King Alfonso XIII telegraphed her to demand that she suspend the book's publication until he had seen it and received his permission to publish it. Eulalia refused to comply. In May 1915, Eulalia wrote an article about the German Emperor William II for The Strand Magazine. The following month she published Court Life from Within (London: Cassell, 1915; reprinted New York: Dodd, Mead, 1915). In August 1925, Eulalia wrote Courts and Countries After The War (London: Hutchinson, 1925; reprinted New York: Dodd, Mead, 1925). In this work she commented on the world political situation and articulated her belief that there could never be peace between France and Germany. She also made a celebrated observation about Benito Mussolini's Italy by reporting that she crossed the Italian frontier and heard the phrase \\"Il treno arriva all'orario\\" [the train is arriving on time], a boast often cited in connection with the Fascist regime at the time.See also Oxford Dictionary of 20th Century Quotations (1998). In 1935, Eulalia published her memoirs in French, the M√©moires de S.A.R. l'Infante Eulalie, 1868‚Äì1931 (Paris: Plon, 1935). In July 1936, they were published in English as Memoirs of a Spanish Princess, H.R.H. the Infanta Eulalia (London: Hutchinson, 1936; reprinted New York: W.W.

He became involved with the followers of William Miller and later became a prominent leader in the Advent Christian Church. == Biography == Himes was born in Wickford, Rhode Island. His parents intended for him to become an Episcopal priest, but when a business deal went sour he was unable to complete his education and was apprenticed to a cabinetmaker in New Bedford, Massachusetts. At 18 he joined the Christian Connexion church in New Bedford where he was licensed as an exhorter. In November 1825 he married Mary Thompson Handy, and the following year was ordained to the ministry. Over the next few years he pastored several districts in Massachusetts, before becoming pastor of the First Christian Church in Boston in 1830. There he rose to prominence, reviving a church that was near death, and becoming active in the educational, temperance, peace, and abolitionist reform movements of the day. Himes met William Miller in 1839 at Exeter, New Hampshire. Impressed, he invited Miller to speak at the Chardon Street Chapel on Chardon Street in Boston. From these lectures Himes became convinced of the imminent return of Christ, and sought opportunities for Miller to preach. In 1840 he published and edited the first Millerite newspaper, the Signs of the Times, in Boston.Signs of the Times , adventistarchives.org He led in organizing general conferences and camp meetings, and published hundreds of pamphlets as well as the second and third editions of Miller's lectures. He organized extensive lecture tours for Miller and himself as far west as Cincinnati, brought about the manufacture of the \\"great tent,\\" at that time the largest tent in the United States, for use on these tours, and established a network of agents, book depots, and reading rooms from Boston to St. Louis. He also published the Thayer lithograph of the first Millerite prophetic chart, designed by Charles Fitch and Apollos Hale. In 1842 he started a second newspaper, the Midnight Cry,Midnight Cry , llu.edu in New York City. Himes' promotional work brought Millerism to the attention of the world. Like Miller, Himes at first opposed the setting of October 22, 1844 as the exact date for the return of Christ, but accepted it shortly before the date arrived. After the Great Disappointment when Jesus did not return on this day, he played a leading role in trying to reorganize the disappointed Adventists around the original Advent faith at the Albany Conference in April 1845. When this failed he became a leader of the Evangelical Adventists and their American Millennial Association (1858), opposing Sabbatarian Adventism and their understanding of the sanctuary as well as those who believed in conditional immortality and the re- establishment of Israel before Christ's Second Coming. In 1863 Himes accepted the doctrine of conditional immortality, joined the Advent Christian Church, and moved his family west to Buchanan, Michigan, assuming a prominent leadership role among Advent Christians and starting a newspaper, The Voice of the West (later Advent Christian Times). In 1865 he was the founding president of the American Advent Mission Society, and was further planning to start a college in Illinois. == See also == * Advent Christian Church * Adventist, Millerites *Second Coming *Seventh-day Adventist Church *Christian revival *Christianity in the 19th century *List of religions and religious denominations#Adventist and related churches *List of Christian denominations#Millerites and comparable groups *Other movements in :Category:Adventism *Great Disappointment *William Miller (preacher) *Millennialism *Second Great Awakening == References == Category:Adventism Category:Millerites Category:People from Warwick, Rhode Island Category:American Christian religious leaders Category:1805 births Category:1895 deaths Category:American newspaper publishers (people) Category:19th-century American journalists Category:American male journalists Category:19th-century American male writers Category:People from Buchanan, Michigan Category:Abolitionists from New Bedford, Massachusetts ","title":"Joshua V.
