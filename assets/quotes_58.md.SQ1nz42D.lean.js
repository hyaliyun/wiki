Leavitt, Trow, & Co published the magazine in New York from 1844 to 1898. It was sold in 1898 to its weekly Boston-based rival, Littell's Living Age, who kept it in publication until 1905. It returned to New York in 1905 but was discontinued in 1907. Its first editor was John Holmes Agnew, a professor of ancient languages and member of the Presbyterian clergy. Agnew was soon replaced by Walter Bidwell, who held the editorship from 1846 until his death in 1881.According to the Yale obituary recorded cited in Walter Bidwell, Bidwell edited the magazine personally only until 1868.

Ellis was an expert of human sexuality but was impotent until the age of 60 and married to an open lesbian for much of his life. He later discovered that he could be aroused by the sight of a woman urinating. Terming this sexual deviation undinism, it is one of several topics covered in the seventh and final volume of his studies in the psychology of sex. Ellis began writing the first of the seven books in 1900, exploring topics such as sexual inversion (homosexuality), sexuality in women, and erotic symbolism throughout the volumes. Volume seven was originally published in the United States due to the stigma surrounding transgenderism, homosexuality, and other sexual deviations in England at the time. The book contains 9 chapters, each exploring a sexual deviation or potential influences. It is largely composed of case studies and directly quotes the individuals he examined, providing the raw descriptions and perspectives of the individuals, rather than his own version of their deviations.  Historical context  In the 1700s, Molly houses began appearing all over the UK – houses where homosexual men could meet. A \\"molly\\" was a man who frequently cross-dressed, and hence can be considered an early representative of transgender individuals. Despite these houses being relatively common, they were not accepted by the general public as homosexuality had been illegal in the UK since the Buggery Act of 1533. Many of the laws and regulations pertaining to sexual deviations in England in the early 1900s were focused on homosexuality among men, viewing it as a mental illness that should be cured. In 1885, the Criminal Law Act was passed in the UK, prohibiting homosexuality. Due to the fact that many associated transgenderism (termed eonism by Ellis) with homosexuality, it was also highly ostracised and not well understood. It was also believed that only men were affected by eonism, and all of Ellis’ studies were conducted on men. Although no laws directly prohibited men dressing as women, it was not an accepted practice, and was viewed as a mental illness that had to be cured. Ellis attempted to normalise these sexual practices, along with others, highlighting that many individuals with these abnormal sexual inclinations were in fact functioning and contributing members of society.  Content  Chapter 1, Eonism: the book begins with an introduction to eonism, Ellis’ equivalent of what is now known as transgenderism. Despite being extremely progressive for his time, Ellis believed that this affliction only occurred among men, and therefore bases all of the case studies on males. He also emphasizes the fact that eonism and sexual inversion (homosexuality) were two completely separate sexual abnormalities that tended not to overlap. This was supported by the fact that all the introduced case studies were purely heterosexual men, who simply felt the urge to express themselves as a female primarily through cross dressing. Chapter 2, The Doctrine of Erogenous Zones: this chapter delves into the basis of various perversions and sexual practices, naming the erogenic zones as a potential contributor. Ellis however states that these zones are also the basis of normal sexual processes, and that sexual perversions are simply more exaggerated versions of these ordinary practices. Chapter 3, The History of Florrie and the Mechanism of Sexual Deviation: here Ellis focuses on the mechanisms of sexual deviation and the specific case study if Florrie, a young woman whom Ellis helped to entertain her sexual fantasies in order to achieve orgasm. Chapter 4, The Menstrual Curve of Sexual Impulse: this chapter is dedicated to the study of female sexuality; more specifically the influence of the menstrual cycle on sexual impulse. Ellis believed that there were three curves of menstruation, and that when these all peaked simultaneously, women would be overcome with a wave of sexual desire. Chapter 5, The Synthesis of Dreams: A Study of a Series of One Hundred Dreams: Ellis describes his method of “dream synthesis”, a method of studying dreams inspired by his fellow academic Sigmund Freud. This method was intended to uncover sexual fantasies and their origin, but Ellis acknowledged the fact that improvements had to be made. Chapter 6, The Conception of Narcissism: this chapter relates narcissism to sexuality, exploring how it can result in sexual deviations and its role in psychoanalysis. Here Ellis again refers to Freud’s work. Chapter 7, Undinism: this chapter is dedicated to undinism, a sexual perversion that Ellis himself experienced in which one gets aroused by the sight of a woman urinating. Ellis believed that it was a combination of heredity and infantile convulsions that produced the predisposition of developing this perversion. Chapter 8, Kleptolagnia: this chapter is again dedicated to a fairly unfamiliar perversion called kleptolagnia: the state of being sexually aroused by theft. Ellis suggested that the development of this sexual deviation can primarily be traced back to childhood, where small stolen items acted as symbols for the individuals secret sexual desires. Chapter 9, The History of Marriage: the final chapter of the book, recounts the history of marriage and its role In a wide variety of sexual perversions.  Reception and influence  All seven volumes of Studies in the Psychology of Sex were widely accepted in the scientific community, even with the progressive perspectives in which it portrayed human sexuality and perversions. Despite this, the book was not published in England until the middle of the 20th century, as it was strongly believed that putting Ellis’ ideas into the public would increase the rates of individuals with sexual perversions. For a long time, concepts like eonism and undinism were assumed to be effects of other psychological disorders such a schizophrenia. Ellis’ innovative take on these perversions and their origins attempted to normalise them and demonstrate that these individuals can be functioning members of society. A few years prior to Ellis' publication of the first volume in his series, Krafft-Ebbing, an Austrian professor of psychiatry, also took an interest in the sexual impulses of transgender individuals. After the publications of both Krafft-Ebbing's and Ellis' studies, other sexologists and psychologists began to show interest in these studies as well. Magnus Hirschfeld, a German sexologist, began to similarly explore the sexual impulses and behaviours of transgender individuals, and eventually gender reassignment surgery. With the help of medical professionals, the first full gender reassignment surgery was completed in Hirschfeld's clinic in 1931 on Lili Elbe. Although Ellis' book was not published everywhere until years after its initial release in the United States, it opened the door to a more accepting view on transgenderism and other sexual perversions, and for the first time disconnected these concepts from mental illness.  Transgenderism in the 21st century  Although transgenderism is said to be the modern equivalent and expansion on Ellis’ eonism, exact equivocation may not be possible. Although there are many similarities, today transgenderism is separated from transvestitism; a distinction that was not as evident in Ellis' works and his eonism seems to incorporate both transvestism and transgenderism. This blurred distinction is further emphasized by the fact that medical procedures available nowadays were not available during Ellis' time. The first official gender reassignment procedure was performed in 1931 – 3 years after the publication of Ellis' last volume - on Lili Elbe, a Danish transgender woman living in (Germany). Regardless of the exact equivocation of eonism, transgenderism is still a complicated topic today. While homosexuality was legalised under the Sexual Offences Act of 1967 and helped to normalise different sexual practices, it was not until 2002 that the U.K. officially declared transgenderism as not being a mental illness, and even later in 2004 that it was allowed for these individuals to legally change their gender. The Equality Act 2010 introduced in the UK introduced new anti-discrimination laws, requiring the equal treatment of individuals, irrespective of their gender or transgender status, age, sexual orientation, race, beliefs, or disability. This and many other initiatives that followed rapidly gained traction in support of the LGBT community.

Gameplay  Dangerous Driving is a racing game and considered by the developers as a spiritual sequel to the Burnout series. Players, after selecting a car and track, attempt to beat the other races (computer- controlled, or other online players). Dangerous Driving includes the same crash elements from Burnout; players can ram opponents into the sides of the track or oncoming damage to cause them to crash (known as Takedowns), temporarily stopping them from racing before their car respawns and they can continue on. By performing Takedowns or other driving stunts like drifting, they build up a Nitro meter; once past a certain threshold they can activate Nitro which gives them a speed boost while some part of the meter is filled.  Development  Three Fields Entertainment was formed by Alex Ward, Fiona Sperry, and Paul Ross, former members of Criterion Games, the original developers of the Burnout franchise, which was published by Electronic Arts (EA). Around 2011, EA assigned the Need for Speed series to Criterion, de- emphasizing the Burnout series, and then later in 2013 moved about 80% of Criterion's staff to Ghost Games to continue Need for Speed. This move left Ward and Sperry concerned about Criterion's state within EA, and decided to leave, along with Ross, to start Three Fields. One of Three Fields' founding goals was to recreate a Burnout game on their own terms. As they were a small team (up to seven by the time of Dangerous Driving compared with the 90 they had when Burnout 3: Takedown was shipping), lacking any assets they had from Criterion, they had to take a slower approach towards this goal, and instead planned on developing less ambitious games that were all aimed towards providing the internal support they needed to get to a Burnout game. These games included Dangerous Golf, which help to establish the destruction system essential to Burnout, Danger Zone, which added in driving elements in a closed environment, and its sequel Danger Zone 2, which added larger environments for driving on. These intermediate games were done on limited budgets and within a short time scale, so lacked some elements that they knew they needed to address by the time Dangerous Driving was to be released. While these games were not blockbuster sellers, the revenues from each helped to fund the development of the next game. The small size and limited resources also helped to enhance their efficiency in producing assets. Ward noted that back when they developed Burnout 2, it had taken 40 staff over two months to put together a single level, while with Dangerous Driving, their small team was able to complete a whole build within that time. Due to its development budget, Dangerous Driving does not include any in-game music, but instead integrates with Spotify to allow players to create their own playlists for the game. Dangerous Driving was released on 9 April 2019. The game shipped without online multiplayer, but this was added on 24 May 2019.  Reception   Accolades  The game won the award for \\"Game, Original Racing\\" at the NAVGTR Awards.  Sequel  Three Fields announced Dangerous Driving 2 for a planned release in late 2020 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and the Nintendo Switch. It is expected to be an open world format, similar in nature to Burnout Paradise.

It was designed by Watt and built in 1886. It is also known as Errowanbang Woolshed. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 23 June 2006.  History  Pre-European Prior to European occupation of the district, the area between Bathurst and Cowra was the home of the Wiradjuri people. Early exploration Following the crossing of the Blue Mountains in 1813 by Gregory Blaxland, William Lawson and William Wentworth, the surveyor George William Evans was sent to survey a road to the plains beyond. In 1815 he continued his work working southwest from the site of Bathurst through the areas now known as Charlotte Creek, Hobby's Yards, Mount Macquarie, Lyndhurst and Gooloogong. In July 1815, Lawson was made Commandant of Bathurst. He died at his home, \\"Veteran Hall\\" on 16 June 1850. Errowanbang station Governor Darling opened the lands west of the Macquarie River for occupation in 1826. Lawson's eldest son, William Lawson the younger, was allowed to occupy \\"land beyond the limits of location\\" and with his father established seven stations west of the Great Dividing Range. Among these was Errowanbang in the parishes of Beaufort and Blake on Flyers Creek. A Church and School Estate was established to the east of Flyers Creek and Lawson the younger settled to the west of the creek also managing the Church and School Estate. When the Church and School Estate was resumed in 1835, he acquired some of the land. With the use of convict labour, Lawson the younger built a homestead on the property around 1827. The house was built of handmade bricks packed with cow hair and mud, stringybark shingles and cedar joinery. The cellar is thought to have also served as the pit for sawing timber during construction and later to house convicts. A fruit orchard was established close to Flyers Creek where Lawson the younger also planted willows. He built the first woolshed on Errowanbang, probably the first woolshed in the district. Built of bush timber with a high gable, it was 120 feet long and 40 feet wide and stood behind the homestead. It was destroyed by strong winds in 1967-8. He died in February 1865, and his younger brother Thomas James Lawson inherited the property, and married Eleanor M. Murray, daughter of the Surveyor-General W. R. Davidson, eight months later. Details of when grazier Henry Grimshaw Lomax purchased Errowanbang have not been researched, but he was in possession of the property by 1879. Little other information is known of this period, although he is believed to have added a kitchen wing to the homestead. Between 1878 and 1881 Lomax and Edmund Wigley Severne, trading as H. G. Lomax, conditionally purchased many hundreds of acres of crown land in the Carcoar area. In 1885 they dissolved their partnership and liquidated their assets. Lomax used legal manouevres to keep his ex-partner from discovering the full nature of the disbursement. Lomax sold Errowanbang to F. R. C. Hopkins and Alexander Wilson (brother of Sir Samuel Wilson) in November 1885. The sale included adjoining properties which had been conditionally purchased by Lomax, but when after a year Lomax had not produced, as promised, their certificates of conformity, Hopkins sued him for £2000. Around 1886 the present woolshed was built. Designed by an architect named Watt, it is a massive building with four levels. Built of white cypress pine at a cost of £5,000, it is reckoned to incorporate 5 tons of nails and bolts. The shed was designed with 40 stands and could hold 3,000 sheep. Also shearing sheep from Panuara station, Hopkins' ambition was to shear 100,000 sheep in one season. The best achieved was 90,000. Wilson left the partnership before 1900 and Hopkins became the sole owner of Errowanbang. The station was divided, Hopkins taking the eastern area of Flyers Creek and the name Errowanbang. To avoid confusion, the remaining part of the property containing the large c.1886 woolshed and the original homestead is generally now known as Old Errowanbang. Hopkins moved to Stokefield at Carcoar while he built a new home on the property. Hopkins continued to graze sheep and a small number of larger stock on his 19,750 acres until his death in 1916. Hopkins' son Rawdon inherited his father's estate. Much of the land which had been retained by Hopkins was resumed under the provisions of the Crown Land Consolidation Act of 1913 and Rawdon Hopkins was left with 5,568 acres. On his remaining land, Rawdon Hopkins ran his Corriedale Stud and built a new woolshed. This shed was burnt in 1928 and then rebuilt, incorporating much of the original structure. Sales of the resumed land proved to be very successful. 13 allotments and a reserve of 3,000 acres had been created from 13,300 acres with the reserved land being set aside for building up small farmers near Burnt Yards. 1,000 acres were also held as a mining reserve. 392 applications were received of which 362 were admitted to a ballot. The next owner of the western part of the original Errowanbang has not been properly researched, although around 1900 Charles Hebden moved into the original homestead. Hebden ran a thoroughbred blood horse stud as well as sheep and cattle on the property. On Old Errowanbang, Hebden was responsible for the construction of a water race system running from the north-east corner on Flyers Creek through to Wire Gully mine. A branch at Triangle ran south to the woolshed where it was intended to power the shearing equipment. This did not happen and the water was used for filling dams and supplying the homestead. Another water race ran from the eastern side of Flyers Creek, near Hopkins new homestead, to the Junction Reefs Mines. Around 1909, Hebden began to sell off some of his land including country in the Panuara area. Hebden died on Errowanbang in 1915. By that time his property was known as Errowanbang Limited. Hebden's nephew, Richard Officer, was the first manager and chief policy holder and managed the property until his death in 1930. Richard Officer and his wife renovated the homestead, adding a new wing to the house to provide accommodation for a classroom, a room for a governess, an office and a dressing room. Bathrooms were also added and the ceilings of the original part renewed. Errowanbang continued to run sheep, including a stud of Romney Marsh. Other stock included cattle and draught horses. The water race continued to operate although it frequently silted up. Eventually rabbit holes caused too many problems and it fell into disuse. After Richard Officer's death, his brother Ernie took over the management for a short time until Bill McKay came with his wife and two children. The McKays remained at Errowanbang until 1940. Ted Holland followed Bill McKay as manager until 1952 when this part of the property was resumed and opened for Soldier Settlements in 1952. A ballot was held for the 11 available blocks with J.W. Harries taking the homestead block. The homestead and outbuildings were used for the accommodation of some of the families and for builders working on new houses for the settlers. Some of the buildings around the homestead were purchased by settlers and (presumably) relocated. These included: * the overseer's cottage which was erected on John Moore's property * the cook house used as part of a woolshed by George Simons * the shearers' huts which were used for material for Frank Press's house * the showers from the shearer's quarters were purchased by Gordon Adamson. Old Errowanbang remains in the ownership of the Harries family. William Lawson (1774-1850) William Lawson was born on 2 June 1774 near London and was educated in London, becoming a surveyor. On 15 June 1799 he paid £300 for his commission in the New South Wales Corps arriving in Port Jackson in 1800 before being sent to serve at Norfolk Island. On his return to Sydney in 1806 he was promoted to a Lieutenant. After serving as aide-de-camp to Major George Johnston, commandant at Newcastle then in Governor Macquarie's Veteran Corps, Lawson retired to his grant at Prospect. In 1813 he joined the expedition across the Blue Mountains with Blaxland and Wentworth. Lawson returned to service in 1819 as Commandant of the settlement of Bathurst from where he spent time surveying the district, resigning from the post in 1824. During his explorations he discovered coal near Mount York, copper north of Bathurst and silver in the western country. Acquiring large areas of land west of the Great Dividing Range, Lawson became an important landholder as well as one of the 12 largest stockowners in the Bathurst district carrying sheep, cattle and horses. In 1843 Lawson became one of the first elected members of the Legislative Council after successfully standing for the seat of Cumberland. Lawson married Sarah Leadbeater with whom he had 11 children, four of who died in infancy. Sarah died in 1830 aged 48 and was buried at their Prospect property, Veteran Hall. Her remains were later transferred to the Lawson vault at St Bartholomew's Church at Prospect. William Lawson died on 16 June 1850 at Prospect. William Lawson the younger (1804-1861) William Lawson's second son (also called William) was born at Norfolk Island in 1804. After accompanying his father to Bathurst, he became the first native born white Australian to receive a grant of land for sheep grazing in the Western Country. In 1836, William Lawson the younger was appointed a magistrate and was a member of the Bathurst bench until 1852. Allowed to occupy lands \\"beyond the limits of location\\" he established and managed, with his father, seven pioneering stations including Errowan-bang on Flyers Creek. In 1832 he married Caroline Icely, sister of Thomas Icely of the nearby Coombing Park with whom he had ten children. After the death of his father, William Lawson the younger moved to Veteran Hall, Prospect where he died in 1861. Caroline died in 1875 Francis Rawdon Chesney Hopkins *See main article F. R. C. Hopkins Hopkins was born at Coolah Point near Mumbai in 1848, the son of a Royal Navy captain. He was sent to live with his uncle General Rawdon Chesney in Ireland. At the age of 16 he came to Australia to live with another uncle, Sir Samuel Wilson, a pastoralist in Victoria. Eventually he came to manage Pericoota station in the Riverina district where he married Sarah Jane Kennedy in 1884. Meanwhile, he had entered into partnerships with Messrs Robertson and Wagner, the owners of Pericoota, sharing properties in Queensland. Leaving Pericoota at the age of 38, he sold his Queensland interests and went into partnership with Alexander Wilson to own Errowanbang. The partnership was dissolved soon after, leaving Hopkins as the sole owner. Wilson was the Managing Director of Australian Estates at the time of the purchase and with Hopkins also had interests in gold and copper mining at Blayney. Hopkins later had interests in the Wire Gully gold mine. Hopkins was a founding member of the Pastoralists' Union in New South Wales. He was well known for his substantial efforts for the Rabbit Board and the Pastures Protection Board, serving for many years as chairman and director of the Carcoar Branch. Other bodies which Hopkins was involved in include the Montenegrin Fund, Allied Day Committee and the French Australian League. Hopkins was a keen writer, preparing a number of plays which were successful in Australia, Canada and the United States. He also wrote verse and a number of books. Hopkins died after falling down an old shaft on the property on 20 July 1916. It is thought that he was trying to make the shaft safe, having lost a number of sheep to insecure shafts. He was survived by his wife Sarah who died in 1942 and his son Rawdon Chesney Hopkins who died in 1973.  Description  Errowanbang woolshed is one of the largest woolsheds in the Central West. Built on the side of a hill, the shed has a unique plan based on four long wings linked in the centre by the main shearing floor. The shearing floor and the wool sorting, baling and storage areas cover four levels. Two wings of the shed are for penning sheep, one including a plunge dip and the other draughting yards. Adjacent to the plunge dip are the crooks etc. for controlling the sheep in the dip. The remaining two wings are divided along their length with one side for sheep waiting to be shorn and the other side of the division being the 40 shearing stands, 20 for each wing. The shearing stands open to a large sorting area, designed to be largely column free by the use of timber trusses supported on massive stone piers. The piers are clad in timber boarding on the shearing floor to avoid wool being caught on the timber. The stands are arranged so that the gun shearers worked in the centre of the space, closest to the sorting area with the slower shearers at the ends of the floor, where the distance for runners and sweepers collecting the wool to bring to the sorting area was the greatest. The sorting area is symmetrical about a diagonal axis. Three classing chutes are either side of the axis and feed wool to the baling level below. A floor above the baling area, the piece picking room is accessed from stairs behind the classing bins and has a chute which led to the main wool press. Tailings and other scraps could then be fed to the press from above. Chutes for the shorn sheep lead from the shearing area to underneath the shed and assist in bracing the structure. On the upper side of the chutes, the timber cladding has timber slats allowing sheep pushed against the ramp to have a foothold and not slip back. The original joinery for most of the stands survives, including the swing doors with their original hinges and the bracketed shelves. Next to the intersection of the two rows of shearing stands, a sliding door at low level provides access for the sheep dogs between the pens and the shearing floor. One end of the stands has been altered in the nineteenth century for mechanised shearing. The remaining 14 stands are still set up as they were for hand shearing. The baling area has two levels, the upper level with divisions to catch the wool fed from the classing chutes above. At the centre and on the lower level was the wool press, now removed although the base is evident in the floor. From here, the bales could be moved to a storage area. A large opening at the end of the storage area originally had a flap which folded down to allow the bales to be taken out onto carts or trucks for transportation. This has been replaced with a sliding door. The woolshed is built of cypress pine. The structure has stumps below floor level with timber posts and framing above. Wherever timber is likely to be in contact with wool, the timber is dressed and corners are chamfered. Additionally, the stone piers are faced with vertical timber boards in the shearing area and pens. The division for the shearing stands is clad with horizontal boarding. Large trusses with iron straps provide an open shearing and sorting area. Corrugated galvanised steel clads the walls and the roof. 6 over 6 pane double hung windows open to the shearing floor. Horizontal windows at high level on the walls open to the penning areas. At the walkways behind the sorting chutes, timber shutters opened as awnings to provide ventilation during shearing. A small engine room has been built on the end of one of the shearing wings, closest to the mechanised stands. The pipework for the water race from Flyers Creek which was intended to power the shears survives close to this room. The shed was reported to be in reasonable condition as at 25 July 2003, considering that only a small area of it was then used. Restumping had been partially undertaken in the past but needed to be completed. Most windows had been broken, largely due to hailstorms. The roofing was generally in good order although repairs of guttering were needed, particularly valley and box gutters.  Heritage listing  Errowanbang Woolshed is one of the most interesting woolsheds of the Central West region of New South Wales. It is perhaps unique in Australia in being built over four levels creating a complex but highly functional structure where each stage of the shearing and sorting process from penning the sheep to sorting, baling and storing has its own distinctive space. With 40 stands, Errowanbang Woolshed is one of the largest woolsheds in the region. Of these stands, 26 have never been adapted for mechanical shearing, providing clear evidence of two major phases of shearing practices in Australia. The original stands retain virtually all of their original fabric providing a clear picture of the working of hand shearing. Names painted on the stands provide evidence of some of the well known shearers who worked at the station in the nineteenth century. Designed by Watts, and one of a number of woolsheds designed by architects in the late nineteenth century, the quality of workmanship in the construction of Errowanbang Woolshed is probably unsurpassed in Australia. The massive stone piers supporting the trusses over the sorting area have contributed to the long term stability of the shed. Internally, details such as the stop chamfers on all corners of timberwork where wool is being moved, good quality hardware and mitred corners of timber flooring show an unusually high attention to detail in what would elsewhere be a utilitarian building. The penning wings of the shed are unusual in including a plunge dip and draughting yards. The incorporation of a plunge dip within the woolshed is possibly unique. Remnant pipes near the shed provide evidence of an unfulfilled attempt at using hydraulic machinery for shearing. They are the clearest surviving evidence of the very ambitious water races which once operated from Flyers Creek to Errowanbang. Hubert 2003 Old Errowanbang Woolshed was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 23 June 2006 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Old Errowanbang Woolshed is historically significant for its associations with the pastoral and woolgrowing industry of colonial and 20th century NSW, especially the central tablelands, and for the evidence it demonstrates of the significant, and evolving, processes of gathering and processing wool for clothing and other manufactured products. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. Old Errowanbang Woolshed is significant for its associations with the architect Watts and the small but important group of architects who designed woolsheds in the late 19th century. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Old Errowanbang Woolshed is of state significance for the technical innovations evident in its four- level design and the internal arrangement of pens and shearing spaces related to the speed of individual sheaers; is aesthetically distinctive as a large timber building of cypress pine with multiple stories on massive stone piers, stop-chamfered posts, mitred timber flooring and high quality hardware throughout the interior, and has landmark qualities as a rambling building that steps down the hillside in its countryside setting in the Flyers Creek valley. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Old Errownbang Woolshed has important associations with several generations of shearers, many of whom have their individual names painted on various pens; and contributes to the rural identity of the inhabitants of the Errowanbang area. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Old Errowanbang Woolshed is of state significance as a benchmark of the changing technologies of sheep shearing, with 26 hand-shearing pens and 14 later adapted to mechanical shearing, the only known internal plunge dip in the region (related to the weather conditions of the Tablelands), and the nearby water races associated with an attempt to develop hydraulic shearing equipment. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Old Errowanbang Woolshed is rare in the region and state as the only known example of its type (an architect-designed, multi-storied sheep shearing complex that could process the sheep almost entirely under cover) and for the exceptional interest of its design and construction detailing. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Old Errowanbang Woolshed demonstrates the principal characteristics of sheep shearing establishments in rural NSW built in the 1880s and successively adapted to changing shearing technologies.

Smolders (born 15 September 1960) is a Dutch politician, former professional ice hockey player, and entrepreneur. He worked as a refrigeration mechanic until he sold his company in 2001. The next year, he was elected member of the House of Representatives as a member of the party Pim Fortuyn List. He served in this position for less than a year. Since then, Smolders has been active in local politics in his home town Tilburg, being a member of the municipal council for most of this period. In 2019, he was elected member of the States of North Brabant. During his years as a refrigeration mechanic, Smolders also was a professional ice hockey player, having played multiple matches for the Dutch national ice hockey team.  Early life and career  Smolders was born on 15 September 1960 in Tilburg. His father was a mailman. Smolders attended vocational school, and graduated in 1977. In the following five years, he received two degrees in refrigeration, one from a college in 's-Hertogenbosch and one from a college in Ede. Alongside, Smolders worked as a refrigeration mechanic. After his education, he kept working in that field, and started his own company in 1984. Smolders sold his company, called \\"Smol Koeling\\", in 2001, causing him to declare himself financially independent. During that same time, Smolders was an ice hockey player of the Tilburg Trappers, playing a total of 341 games between 1977 and 1986. Furthermore, he was part of the Dutch junior ice hockey team and of the national ice hockey team, playing in 13 international matches for the latter team between 1978 and 1983.  Political career   National  Smolders was a candidate in the 2002 general election as a member of the Pim Fortuyn List. He was the 16th person on the candidate list of that party. During the election season, he was Pim Fortuyn's driver. Nine days before the election, Fortuyn was assassinated by Volkert van der Graaf. As Fortuyn's driver, Smolders witnessed the event, and said he followed the suspect afterwards until Van der Graaf was arrested by the police. After the election, he became a member for the Pim Fortuyn List in the House of Representatives. He left the lower house in January 2003.  Municipal  At the end of the 2003, he founded his own local political party called the Smolders List. In April 2004, Smolders said a man showed up at his home armed with a gun, saying he should leave politics. Smolders said he would stop as party leader because of the incident. The perpetrator was never found. Smolders joined the local Tilburg Elderly Party (TOP) at the end of 2004, saying he would be active within the party and opened up the possibility of running for a seat in the Tilburg municipal council for that party. Smolders participated with his own party, List Smolders, in the March 2006 municipal elections. His party won 5 out of 39 seats in the Tilburg municipal council, and he became a member of the council. While he was still a member of the municipal council, Smolders appeared on the ballot during the November 2006 general election. Smolders was the 19th person on the candidate list of the party One NL, which was founded a few months before the elections. However, the party did not win any seats in the House of Representatives. Smolders remained a council member in Tilburg. Smolders clashed with mayor Ruud Vreeman, who he accused of corruption and mismanagement. When Smolders was investigated for corruption (see #Legal affairs), he said the investigation was started by Vreeman as an excuse for mistakes Vreeman had made regarding the renovation of a local theater. Vreeman resigned because of the scandal surrounding the Midi Theater in October 2009 after a censure motion by the municipal council. When the next municipal elections took place in 2010, Smolders decided his party would not participate. He stated this was due to health reasons. Smolders re-entered politics in 2014, when he participated again with his party List Smolders in the municipal elections. He said it was his duty as a citizen to stop mismanagement. His party won five out of the 45 seats in the Tilburg municipal council, causing Smolders to become a member of the council once more. In 2017, Smolders was chosen \\"politician of the year\\" by the readers of the local news website Tilburgers.nl. During the next elections in 2018, his party received a plurality in the Tilburg municipal council. His party's seat number doubled to 10. Smolders called it a \\"historic victory\\". Although his party won the most seats in the municipal council of any party, it did not become part of the coalition that makes up the executive board. A demonstration against the fact Smolders's party was excluded was held in April and reportedly attracted about one hundred protestors including Smolders himself.  Provincial  Smolders appeared on the ballot during the 2019 Dutch provincial elections as lijstduwer of Forum for Democracy (FvD) in the province North Brabant. As lijstduwer, he appeared on place 15 on FvD's list for the election and he said he wanted to be elected with preferential votes. Smolders received 20,833 preferential votes, enough to become a member of the States of North Brabant, and was sworn in on March 28. Forum for Democracy received nine out of 55 seats in the States, becoming the second biggest party behind the VVD. Smolders remains a member of the Tilburg municipal council.  Legal affairs  In 2007, the mayor, Ruud Vreeman, filed charges against Smolders for leaking confidential information about alleged drug trade in a nightclub. Smolders defended himself by saying the information should not have been confidential in the first place. Shortly after, Smolders charged Vreeman with fraud. He alleged the mayor wrongfully provided redundancy pay for former members of the municipal council. The court said Smolders kept leaking after he was charged, and he was given a fine of €750 on appeal. In October 2009, Smolders was investigated after he was accused of leaking a report about the Midi Theater to several media outlets. The report, which criticized mayor Vreeman for holding back information about cost overruns, was made public three days after the leaking occurred. Smolders was not prosecuted, as no evidence was found he was behind the leaking. That same month, a Dutch governmental unit investigating corruption started an investigation into Smolders. According to the accusation, Smolders had asked a developer a €75,000 bribe to vote in favor of a project to build a shopping mall in Tilburg. The developer subsequently informed mayor Vreeman. Smolders denied the accusation of corruption. He said that he suspected Vreeman had been bribed into supporting the project, and that he wanted to test whether he would also be able to get a bribe from the company. According to Smolders, this was a failed plan to expose Vreeman's alleged corruption. In February 2010, it was announced that Smolders would not be prosecuted as no hard evidence was found.  Personal life  Smolders lives together with his partner, Jacqueline. They have one daughter and one son, who were born in 1988 and 1990 respectively.

The whole figure is composed of flowers, the skin of the face and lips are rose petals and buds, the hair is a colorful and lush bouquet, the eyes are belladonna berries. A daisy necklace adorns the neck, while the body is covered in a vast jungle of leaves of different shapes. Summer is also depicted by a woman who, unlike Spring, is facing right and is made up, not of flowers, but of fruits and vegetables. Cherries adorn the border of her hair and also make up her upper lip; her cheek is made of a peach, her nose of a cucumber, her ear of an eggplant and her eyebrow of an ear of wheat. Her dress is made of straw, with, on the Louvre copy, the inscription GIUSEPPE ARCIMBOLDO F (F standing for FECIT) on the collar and the year 1573 on the shoulder. An artichoke decorates her chest. Kaufmann, 61 Autumn is represented by a surly man with rough features looking to the left. The neck, made up of two pears and some vegetables, emerges from a partially destroyed vat, whose wooden slats are bound together with willow branches. His face is made of apples and pears, especially the cheek and nose, his chin is a pomegranate, while the ear is a mushroom, with a fig-shaped earring. The lips and mouth are made of chestnuts. His hair is made up of bunches of grapes and his bonnet of a pumpkin. Winter is represented as an old man, whose skin is a gnarled trunk, with the abrasions and swellings of the wood representing the skin wrinkles of old age.

The eye is a black cleft in the log and the ear what remains of a broken branch; his hair is a tangle of branches, accompanied on the back by a series of small leaves. His bare figure is animated only by the colors of lemon and orange, hanging on a branch from the man's chest, citrus being the only winter fruit in Italy. Kaufmann, 96 The man's dress is a simple straw mat: in the original version of the painting the old man wore a cape on which was inscribed an M and a crown, in this case certainly a memory of Maximilian II. Kaufmann, 97 Winter, the first season of the year in the Roman Calendar and therefore the most important of the four, was associated with the emperor even more directly among contemporaries. Thomas DaCosta Kaufmann The Mastery of Nature . Aspects of Art, Science, and Humanism in the Renaissance. Ed. University of Chicago Press. 1993. Pag.124 This series is analogous to another of Arcimboldo's sets called The Four Elements. Both series have the same number of pieces, and logically correspond to each other; Air to Spring, Fire to Summer, Earth to Autumn and Water to Winter. This pairing creates linked themes of chaos brought into harmony and the glorification of the Habsburg dynasty. In the early 20th century, Arcimboldo's work was relegated to the category of \\"macabre mockery\\" of Leonardo da Vinci 's cartoonish designs, which perhapsArcimboldo saw in Milan. The painter was probably not inspired by the composition of their heads, but the links between the two artists are unclear.

Retrieved 21 June 2018 Until the gradual standardization of English spelling in the last few centuries, English lacked any comprehensive system of spelling. Cornish names, particularly as they were anglicized from the original Cornish, historically displayed wide variations in recorded spellings as scribes of the era spelled words according to how they sounded rather than any set of rules. This means that a person's name was often spelled several different ways over a lifetime. As such, different variations of the Bossence surname usually have the same origin.

The union immediately affiliated with the Irish Trades Union Congress, and from the start worked closely with the British Union of Post Office Workers. The IPOEU was unhappy with the merger arrangements, and so it withdrew early on, to continue an independent existence. The union was soon renamed as the Post Office Workers' Union (POWU). From 1924 to 1957, the union was led by William Norton, who for much of this time also served as leader of the Labour Party. Under his leadership, the union steadily grew, from 4,000 members in 1930, to 7,302 in 1960. The small Transferred Officers' Protection Association amalgamated with the union in 1930, and the Post Office Clerical Association joined in 1958. The union became the Postal Telecommunications Workers' Union in 1984. In 1989, it merged into the Communications Union of Ireland, which renamed itself as the Communication Workers' Union.

Involvement in the Munich Massacre Graes had volunteered to work as one of 2,000 Olympic security guards during the 1972 Munich Olympic Games. Upon hearing of the hostage taking Graes rushed to 31 Connollystraße to volunteer as intermediary. According to Simon Reeve, author of the book One Day in September, Graes had a mature, easy manner which her superiors had hoped would put the terrorists at ease. At 8:10am Graes made her way to 31 Connollystraße to replace Frau Lauterbach, a young policewoman who had already gone to 31 Connollystraße to establish contact with the terrorists. Although Simon Reeve intimates that Graes volunteered to be an intermediary and was chosen by Manfred Schreiber for the task, it appears Graes went to the scene of her own volition and began to act as intermediary without any prior instruction from her superiors. She would act as the intermediary between the Black September leader Luttif Afif and the German delegation until the terrorists and Israeli hostages left 31 Connollystraße via the underground car park by bus, and then to waiting helicopters which were supposed to transport them to Fürstenfeldbruck Air Base. It was clear from the outset that Afif was quite comfortable with Graes, both could be seen chatting regularly in front of 31 Connollystraße when Afif was not involved in negotiations with the German delegation. Afif told Graes about his life, most of which was corroborated later by Palestinian sources. Afif offered Graes cigarettes and even shared food with Graes, at one point both could be seen eating bananas and then tossing the skins through the front door of 31 Connollystraße before the Afif picked them up. Aftermath Graes gave evidence to the official Bavarian pre-criminal investigation into the events of 5 September. In 1974 Graes was awarded the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany for her actions. She only rarely spoke about her involvement in the Munich crisis and refused all offers of money for her story regarding the events of that day. Death Graes died in Bottrop, Germany, aged 62.

It is also known as the tilted square sail, canted rectangular sail, or balance lug sail in English. In historical sources, tanja sail is sometimes incorrectly to referred as lateen sail or simply square sail. Etymology garay from Sulu commissioned by Thomas Forrest in his 1774 expedition to New Guinea Also called tanjaq, tanjak, tanja', tanjong, or tanjung sail. The Mandar people call it sombal tanjaq because when the wind blows the lower part of the sail (peloang) would \\"mattanjaq\\" (lit. \\"kick\\"). In colonial British records, it is sometimes written as \\"lyre tanjong\\", a misspelling of layar tanjong (layar means \\"sail\\" in Malay; layag in Philippine languages). Origin Early contact with Arab ships in the Indian Ocean during Austronesian voyages is believed to have resulted in the development of the triangular Arabic lateen sail. In turn, Arab ships are believed to have influenced the development of the Austronesian rectangular tanja sail. However, there are also historians who disagree with this. Johnstone, Shaffer, and Hourani considered this sail as a genuine invention of Nusantaran people, which in turn influenced the Arabs to develop their lateen sail.Shaffer, Lynda Norene (1996). Maritime Southeast Asia to 1500. M.E. Sharpe. A research by Lynn White concludes that the Arab and Indian lateen sail is actually an adaptation the lateen sail from the Portuguese ships (caravel), which arrived post 1498s.White, Lynn (1978), \\"The Diffusion of the Lateen Sail\\". Medieval Religion and Technology. Collected Essays, University of California Press, pp. 255-260. According to H. Warington Smyth, the Malay tanja sail is an adaptation and development of the primitive square sail, with boom at the head and the foot. The Malay tilted the sail forward, to bring the tack right to the deck, turning the sail into the most powerful of lifting sails on a wind. Characteristics 1863 illustration of padewakang ships in Sulawesi with furled and unfurled tanja sails Tanja sail can be distinguished by its canted/oblique design. The sail face is asymmetrical in shape and most of the area is elongated to the sides, rather than upward like those of lug sail. The 3rd century book \\"Strange Things of the South\\" (南州異物志) by Wan Chen (萬震) describes large ships which originates from K'un-lun (Southern country, either Java or Sumatra). The ships called K'un-lun po (or K'un-lun bo). He explains the ship's sail design as follows: The invention of this type of sail made sailing around western coast of Africa possible, because of its ability to sail against the wind. As noted by Hourani: > \\"The Malays were also the first to use balance-lug sail, an invention of > global significance. Balance-lugs are square sails set fore and aft and > tilted down at the end. They can be pivoted sideways, which makes it > possible to sail into the oncoming wind at an angle to tack against the wind > – to sail at an angle first one way and then the other, in a zigzag pattern, > so as to go in the direction from which the wind is blowing. Because of the > way the sides of the sail were tilted, from a distance it looked somewhat > triangular....

A smother crop is a thick, rapidly growing crop that is used to suppress or stop the growth of weeds. Smother crops have better root systems that help them compete with weeds for water, and as a result the root systems of weeds get weak. Meanwhile, the dense top growth of the smother crop suppresses the top growth of weeds. Effectively, smother crops successfully compete with weeds for vital resources (growth space, water and light) and inhibit their germination and growth. Once the smother crop has served its purpose, it is ploughed under along with the weakened weeds, thus providing green fertilizer. A good smother crop must compete strongly with weeds but minimally with the crop. Smother crops reduce dependence on chemical weed control, and are sometimes used in the transition to organic farming. Secondary benefits of such crops include helping nitrogen fixation in soil (if legumes are used) and reducing soil erosion. Alfalfa, hemp, rye, buckwheat, sorghum, Sudan grass, foxtail millet, sweetclover, marigold, silage corn are some examples of smother crops.

Played by William Zabka, he serves as the secondary antagonist of The Karate Kid as well as being Daniel LaRusso's main rival, appears briefly in The Karate Kid Part II, and is one of the main protagonists of the web television series Cobra Kai. Fictional biography Johnny Lawrence was born on August 20, 1967, and never knew his father. Johnny moved to the upscale neighborhood of Encino, California, after his mother Laura married Hollywood producer Sid Weinberg. A friendless Johnny was often verbally abused by his stepfather, especially after quitting drums, rollerskating, and magic lessons. As a result, Johnny would use his Walkman to drown out Sid's heckling. One day in 1979, while riding his bicycle, a 12-year-old Johnny discovered the original Cobra Kai dojo and spent the next five years learning karate under sensei John Kreese. Laura died in 2002, shortly before Johnny's son Robby Keene was born in February of that year. Johnny took his mother's death hard, and while grieving went on a drinking binge that caused him to miss his son's birth. Appearances The Karate Kid (1984) In The Karate Kid, Johnny is the top student of the Cobra Kai dojo, leader of the Cobra Kai gang, and two-time defending champion of the All Valley Under-18 Karate Championships tournament. Prior to the events of the film, his girlfriend Ali Mills broke up with him after a two-year relationship. One night at a beach party, Johnny confronts Ali about their breakup and starts getting violent. New Jersey native Daniel LaRusso, who recently moved to the area, tries to stick up for Ali, and Johnny beats him up with his karate skills. Over the next few weeks, Johnny and his Cobra Kai gang harass Daniel in and out of school. At the Halloween dance, Daniel soaks Johnny in the bathroom with a hose while he is rolling a joint, prompting Johnny and the other Cobras to chase him down and beat him until Mr. Miyagi, the maintenance man of Daniel's apartment building, intervenes and defeats Johnny and his gang. The next day, Mr. Miyagi confronts Kreese at the Cobra Kai dojo and proposes that Daniel and Johnny's feud be settled in the upcoming tournament. Kreese agrees, but warns that if they do not attend the tournament, both Daniel and Mr. Miyagi will be declared fair game to Cobra Kai. At the tournament, Johnny quickly advances to the finals, scoring three unanswered points against a highly skilled opponent in his semi-final match. When Daniel reaches the semi-finals, Bobby Brown, one of the more compassionate Cobras and the least vicious of Daniel's tormentors, reluctantly (under orders from Kreese) strikes Daniel's knee with an illegal kick, getting himself disqualified while Johnny looks at Kreese in disgust. Before Johnny is declared the victor by default, Ali informs the tournament announcer that Daniel will fight in the final round. During the fight, Daniel gets the upper hand and gives Johnny a bloody nose. Kreese orders Johnny to sweep Daniel's leg, an unethical move. Fearing his sensei, Johnny manages to land an elbow on Daniel's bad leg, receiving a warning from the referee. Upon the restart of the round, Johnny loses the match after Daniel lands a crane kick to his face. Having gained a new respect for his nemesis, Johnny personally gives Daniel the trophy. The Karate Kid Part II (1986) In The Karate Kid Part II, Kreese harshly reprimands Johnny for losing to Daniel, breaking his second- place trophy and locking him in a chokehold. The other Cobra Kai students plead for Kreese to let go of Johnny until Mr. Miyagi intervenes. Mr. Miyagi dodges Kreese's punches, causing Kreese to injure his hands from breaking two car windows. He further humiliates Kreese by mocking Cobra Kai's founding tenets and tweaking his nose after halting a fatal blow deathly close to its target. Following the incident, Johnny and his friends leave Cobra Kai forever. Cobra Kai (2018–) =Season 1= Cobra Kai takes place 34 years after the first film. Now in his 50s, Johnny is a divorced, down-on-his- luck alcoholic loner who is estranged from the now-teenaged Robby, spending most of his time drinking Coors Banquet beer and often resorting to bottles of whiskey when depressed. He struggles to make a living as a handyman in the San Fernando Valley, but is fired from this job after getting into an argument with a customer. He appears to be oblivious to most technology released after the 1990s, as he still carries a flip phone and is unfamiliar with the Internet and social media platforms such as Facebook. In addition, Johnny cites Iron Eagle and its sequel as his favorite movies and continues to listen to classic 1980s rock music. He also harbors a resentment of Daniel, who is now owner of a successful car dealership despite showing good sportsmanship to him by handing the trophy during the 1984 All-Valley Tournament. The duo re- encounter one another after Johnny's red Pontiac Firebird is towed to his dealership following a hit and run caused by Daniel's daughter Samantha and her friends. Johnny reluctantly allows Daniel to have the car repaired for free, but is enraged to find out that Samantha is Daniel's daughter. One night, Johnny steps in after witnessing his teenage neighbor Miguel Diaz being harassed by a group of rich bullies at a strip mall after they shove Miguel against his car, but is arrested in the process. He is bailed out by Sid, who offers to buy him out of his life with an undisclosed sum of money. Johnny initially rejects the money out of pride, but after reuniting with Daniel, Johnny uses the money to reopen the Cobra Kai dojo, with Miguel as his first student. After Miguel beats up the rich bullies in the school lunchroom, dozens of other students flock to the dojo. Johnny tries to enter Cobra Kai in the upcoming All-Valley Under-18 Karate Championships tournament, but he discovers that the dojo has been given a lifetime ban due to the ruthless actions of Kreese, Terry Silver, and Mike Barnes (from The Karate Kid Part III). Johnny approaches the All-Valley Committee and states that his Cobra Kai is run differently than it was under Kreese, claiming that Kreese has been dead for years and he has never had any association with or even heard of Silver or Barnes. Johnny explains that he alone holds authority over the dojo and that he endeavors to make a difference in the lives of local youth who have been bullied. The board voted to lift the ban and allow Cobra Kai to enter the tournament over the objections of Daniel, now also a committee member. As the dojo gains more students, Johnny gradually earns enough money to keep it afloat and pay back Sid, vowing to never return to him again. On the back of this success, Johnny trains his dojo even more rigorously. However, his conflict with Daniel is exacerbated by a series of misunderstandings, culminating with Daniel's cousin destroying Johnny's car and assaulting him supposedly in Daniel's name. Enraged, Johnny comes to Daniel's home to fight him, but Daniel's wife, Amanda, manages to defuse the conflict by inviting Johnny to breakfast to discuss the matter peacefully and persuades her husband to give Johnny a car from the trade-in lot of his dealership as compensation. While test driving a 2009 Dodge Challenger R/T, Johnny and Daniel make considerable progress coming to terms, until their return to Daniel's residence leads to Johnny discovering that Robby is Daniel's karate protégé. At that point, an enraged Johnny shoves Daniel, only to have Robby defend his teacher. At the All-Valley tournament, both Miguel and Eli (nicknamed Hawk) make it to the semi-finals, along with Robby. When Robby and Hawk fight, Johnny chastises Hawk for illegally attacking Robby's shoulder, which gets him disqualified and leaves Robby and Miguel to meet in the final match. When Miguel ruthlessly exploits Robby's injured shoulder against his sensei's wishes, Johnny realizes that his teaching methods have corrupted his students. Miguel wins the tournament and thanks Johnny for his guidance, but Johnny is too dejected by his actions to celebrate. He stops Robby before he can leave the arena and apologizes to him, which Robby accepts with reasonable politeness. Later that night, a very much alive John Kreese shows up unexpectedly at the Cobra Kai dojo to congratulate him. =Season 2= In Season 2, Johnny addresses the tactics committed by Miguel and Hawk during the tournament and downgrades his entire team back to white belt to further discipline them, banning any form of cheating or dirty fighting from the dojo despite their \\"no mercy\\" teachings. He also begins employing a stricter training regimen, going so far as forcing his students to push a full concrete mixer from the inside. To further promote his dojo, Johnny has his Dodge Challenger repainted black and decorated with Cobra Kai logos, and has the sound system replaced with a cassette player for his mixtape collection. Johnny initially rebuffs Kreese's attempts to reconcile, and blames him for ruining his life. After Kreese apologizes for his previous actions and repairs Johnny's second-place trophy, he relents and agrees to partner with Kreese by making him an observer before making him a co-sensei. In the meantime, Daniel reopens Miyagi-do in an attempt to compete with and undermine Cobra Kai by offering lessons for free. While Daniel initially has little success in these efforts, several Cobra Kai students defect to Miyagi-do after a group of students led by Hawk proceeds to vandalize the Miyagi-do dojo with the blessing of Kreese. Johnny eventually discovers that Kreese has been teaching his students the old ways of Cobra Kai behind his back and expels him from the dojo. During this time, Johnny buys a used laptop and discovers the Internet. He also upgrades to a smartphone, joins Facebook, and eventually finds love in Miguel's mother Carmen. At the same time, Johnny slowly reconciles with Robby. After a chance encounter at a restaurant, Johnny and Daniel make another attempt at reconciliation. But their uneasy peace proves short-lived after a misunderstanding involving Robby and Samantha, leading to a showdown between Daniel and Johnny in the latter's apartment. A massive conflict between the two dojos' students erupts on the first day of school, ending with Robby inadvertently putting Miguel in intensive care. Johnny's life and relationships are severely in limbo, with a missing Robby likely in legal trouble and Carmen breaking up with him over Miguel's injuries. Making matters worse, Kreese regains control of Cobra Kai and forces Johnny out, revealing that while Johnny was visiting his dying friend Tommy, Kreese made a deal with the landlord to take over the dojo. Most of Cobra Kai's students turn against Johnny and side with Kreese, who vows to never let them down. A guilt-ridden Johnny goes to the beach and gets intoxicated, haunted by Miguel's injuries and being betrayed by his students and Kreese. He throws his bottle of whiskey at his car, abandoning it and his smartphone, which he drops in the sand. He walks away, not noticing that Ali has sent him a friend request on Facebook. Reception Johnny Lawrence, as conceived in the original films, was an archetypal bully. Since the turn of the 21st century however, his character (along with that of Daniel LaRusso), has been more deeply developed. Notably in 2013, Macchio and Zabka made a guest appearance as themselves in the television sitcom How I Met Your Mother (\\"The Bro Mitzvah\\"). In the episode, Macchio is invited to Barney Stinson's bachelor party, leading to Barney shouting that he hates Macchio and that Johnny was the real hero of The Karate Kid. Towards the end of the episode, a clown in the party wipes off his makeup and reveals himself as Zabka. This influenced the 2018 web television series, Cobra Kai, which gives a balanced perspective for Johnny, Daniel, and other characters. Zabka continued to be a recurring character throughout the ninth season of the show.

History Gaelchultúr was founded in 2004 with the aim of promoting gaelic culture and language in Ireland. It has published several textbooks and provided courses since then. In 2013, the QQI/HETAC granted Gaelchultúr recognition as a third level institution with the ability to award recognised qualifications, thus giving birth to Coláiste na hÉireann. It occupies a unique position as the first independent third-level institution to operate through the medium of Irish. This, notwithstanding the foundation of Acadamh na hOllscolaíochta Gaeilge nine years previously, since the academy is considered a part of NUI Galway and therefore not independent. The company Gaelchultúr did not cease to exist after the foundation of Coláiste na hÉireann. It continues to operate, however the two names seem to be synonymous. View of Clare Street, Dublin; Coláiste na hÉireann visible at left Courses Postgraduate Diploma in Translation The flagship course provided by Coláiste na hÉireann is its Postgraduate Diploma in Translation (Dioplóma Iarchéime san Aistriúchán; NFQ Level 9). This is conducted over three semesters via mixed learning. As the face-to-face portions are limited to one Saturday per month, this programme does not exclude students who are also working full-time. The subject matter deals with translation theory, precision and richness of language, and translation practice. Topics in legal translation and translation technology are also taught. Certificate in Professional Irish Gaelchultúr offers courses leading to a Component Certificate in Professional Irish (Teastas sa Ghaeilge Ghairmiúil). These are available at differing language levels, from relative beginner to advanced. The category of the qualification varies from NFQ Level 3-6, depending on the language level. These certificates are aimed primarily at filling the substantial gap between many public sector bodies have between their statutory obligations with regard to provision of services in Irish, and their actual capabilities.  Collaboration   MA in Applied Irish  Beginning in 2008, Gaelchultúr collaborated with DIT's School of Languages, Laws and Social Sciences to run an MA in Applied Irish (MA sa Ghaeilge Fheidhmeach). The course was delivered for several years.

It provides access to education, to medical care (including the helping with training of medical practitioners) and supplies basic amenities, including sanitation and transport. Invited to give talks internationally, Slade's appearances as a public speaker have included the Oxford Human Rights Festival in 2018 and a TEDX talk in January 2017. She is the subject of a short film – \\"Happiness\\" – that is part of a schools education project set up by the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford. Slade received a Points Of Light Award, conferred by 10 Downing Street, from the British Honorary Consul Michael Rutland OBE and Lyonpo Damcho Dorji, Bhutan's Minister for Foreign Affairs, in January 2017. The ceremony took place at the Draktsho School for Special Children (which is supported by her charity) in the Bhutanese capital, Thimphu. She was also short-listed for the Asian Voice Charity Award for \\"Most Inspiring Individual in Charity\\" in January 2018. Having met children who are directly benefiting from Slade's endeavours, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge met with Slade and discussed her work during their 2016 tour of Bhutan. After rigorous training – and unusually for a mother (she has one son, Oscar, born 14 September 2006) – Slade was ordained as a Buddhist nun in Bhutan in February 2014, the first (and as of 2018 still the only) Western woman to have achieved this. Her autobiography, Set Free: A Life-Changing Journey from Banking to Buddhism in Bhutan, published in April 2017, reached the number 1 spot in the Amazon charts in the Religious Biography category and details the role of traumatic events in changing the course of her life. Slade gained one of only two first class honours degrees awarded by Goldsmiths College in Fine Arts in 1993 (the other going to fellow student Steve McQueen). But grief turned her away from a career as an artist/sculptor. It compelled her instead to become a \\"High- rolling, high-stakes banker\\" managing \\"accounts worth upwards of a $billion.\\" After being robbed and held hostage at gunpoint in her Jakarta hotel room by a man also carrying hidden knives, PTSD Post-traumatic stress disorder and a sharpened awareness of the value of life underpinned Slade's eventual decision to leave HSBC, although she returns there by invitation as a motivational speaker. Early life and education Emma Alexandra Slade was born on 16 July 1966 in Whitstable, Kent, the eldest of three children. Her sister, Katherine Lucy Clarke, was born on 31 May 1968, with brother Toby James Newcombe Slade following on 5 May 1970. Their mother, Zinnia Slade (née Devan), who was born in London, grew up near Chilbolton in Hampshire and went to finishing school. Whilst in London in the early 1960s, Zinnia met David Slade, an insurance broker with Willis, Faber and Dumas, who was born in Epping, Essex. They married in the parish church in Chilbolton and moved to Whitstable in Kent. Here, Zinnia Slade, who had been cared for by a nanny, was determined to become a stay-at-home mother and bring up her children herself. Emma attended Joy Lane Primary School, and on passing the Eleven Plus (known in Kent as the Kent Test), she attended Barton Court Girls Grammar. Describing herself as tall and shy, she gained eight O-levels and went to Sevenoaks School as a boarder in the sixth form. Gaining straight As in English, History, and Geography at A-level, she also passed the higher S-level in English and Geography. Offered an unconditional place at Cambridge to study English at Selwyn College, Slade was not required to sit the Oxbridge entrance exam. Attending Selwyn College between 1985 and 1989, and after swapping from English to History, she left in the autumn term of her final year, prior to graduation. After spending time with her parents, who had moved to Summit, New Jersey, whilst her father worked in Manhattan, Slade shaved off her hair and returned to Cambridge. Taking a job in an Iceland supermarket, she was asked to wear a wig, to which she set fire upon being accepted to the Art foundation course at Cambridge College of Arts and Technology (Later Anglia Ruskin University). Completing this, Slade landed a place on the prestigious Fine Art degree at Goldsmiths, University of London. She gained one of the only two first class honours awarded on the course to those who graduated in 1993. The other was given to her fellow student, future film director Steve McQueen. Career Banking Whilst she was in her final year at Goldsmiths, Slade's father was diagnosed with lung cancer. She told Lauren James of the South China Morning Post: \\"The first real shock was the death of my father when I was 26. When I was 10 or 11, my Dad had said he could see me going into investment banking. Until his illness I imagined I would be an artist or a curator. But, with his death, I could not continue with that plan. I needed to make sure I could make a living and not lean on mum.\\" After her graduation and working in an old people's home in Whitstable for a \\"few months\\", Slade applied to the HSBC global graduate scheme. After a series of tests and interviews held over a period of weeks, Slade was one of six people (and the only woman) out of hundreds of applicantshttps://news.efinancialcareers.com/binaries/content/gallery/efinancial- careers/articles/2013/07/agr-applications-per-place.jpg who was successful. Placed in London, Slade gained her Investment Management Certificate. She then embarked on the prestigious three-year Chartered Financial Analyst course, at that time run by AIMR. Slade completed the first level in New York, in 1995, whilst working in the fixed income and corporate bond investment team and living in mid-town Manhattan. Back in London and working for the Chief Investment Officer on Special Projects, Slade was assessing the fund management market potential of all the other European countries whilst completing the second level of her CFA exams. In July 1996, Slade was sent to Hong Kong, initially to work in marketing, and \\"became a South East Asian Emerging Debt Analyst\\" whilst studying for the third level of the CFA examinations (that included statistics, compliance, and equity and debt markets). She gained the qualification in 1997 and the highest marks possible in her annual appraisal that year. In September 1997, Slade was in Jakarta on a solo business trip (not on holiday as reported in the English press)) and was robbed and held hostage at gunpoint in her five-star hotel room by a man who was also carrying hidden knives. Subsequently, assigned a bodyguard, Slade continued with her four-day business trip and returned to work in Hong Kong. Receiving counselling, Slade was diagnosed with severe PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder). \\"It meant\\", she said, \\"suffering constant flashbacks.\\" In her description of the aftermath of her experience, there is no separation between the past and the present and \\"you lose trust in everything – in yourself, your body and the world around you.\\" This, combined with sudden unexpected hostility from a trusted boss, caused Slade to return to England. After receiving intensive two-week therapy at the PTSD unit at Ticehurst Priory, Slade returned to work for the Chief Investment Officer at HSBC in London, but found that \\"making money and having a career – two things she had equated with success and happiness – were a very small part of who she actually was,\\" saying, \\"Once you think you are going to die you do start to live your life in a different way. I had survived this experience and I wanted to explore more of what I could potentially do with my life.\\" Having been shown a picture of her captor, slumped, bloodied and in his underpants, by the police in Jakarta on the day of her ordeal, she says: \\"I just was absolutely overwhelmed with compassion for him, and for me, and for the whole situation. It definitely ignited something in me.\\" And \\"I wanted to explore more what it is to be a human being and what is this strange feeling of kindness we can have to each other even in these situations.\\" Slade resigned from HSBC in June 1998. She returned to HSBC in 2005 for three years, working in London until 2008 as an analyst in the hedge fund sector. Teaching yoga In the summer of 1998, Slade's mother paid for her daughter to take off on an 'alternative holiday' packed with courses such as 'making mosaics' on the Greek island of Skyros. Here, Slade tried a yoga class for the first time and discovered she was 'a natural' saying: \\"I had found my thing.\\" Slade then travelled the globe to study with the best teachers in order to become a yoga teacher herself; her teachers included Nancy Gilgoff in Hawaii, Tias Little in Santa Fe, New Mexico, Dena Ginsberg in Byron Bay, Australia, David Swenson in Costa Rica, and John Scott in Cornwall. Slade qualified in 2001 as a British Wheel of Yoga instructor and set up her ongoing yoga teaching practise, Whitstable Yoga, in a dedicated studio in Whitstable, Kent. Becoming a Buddhist In July 2003, she attended Kagyu Samye Ling Monastery and Tibetan Centre in Eskdalemuir in the Scottish Borders, for a series of short retreats to focus on her increasing interest in meditation and Buddhist philosophy, particularly in relation to its teachings on compassion – Chenrezig. (Avalokiteśvara in Sanskrit). Slade formally converted to Buddhism in 2003. In going to Bhutan in 2011, Slade realised a childhood dream. On that first visit, she had two meetings that would change her life. The first was a profound meeting with a man she assumed was a monk in the Druk Wangyal Lhakhang temple in the Dochula Pass, at an altitude of over 3,100 metres. The second was a fortuitous conversation with Brent Hyde, the General Manager of Paro's Zhiwa Ling Hotel, in which she was staying. Hyde mentioned that the hotel would need a yoga teacher over the Christmas period, and Slade got the job. Returning to Bhutan to teach yoga, Slade searched for the monk she had met at the temple, only to be told that he'd gone on retreat for three years. She felt that all was lost, but discovered that although the monk had gone on retreat, she had met not a monk, but a Lama. Lama Nima Tshering (meaning \\"Teacher Sun Long-lasting\\" – Tshe means life and ring means long in the Bhutanese language Dzongkha). Lama Tshering was not on retreat but in his home village, and he agreed to come and meet her at the Zhiwa Ling Hotel on 31 December 2011. Slade's tuition in the practice of Tibetan Buddhism began in the Shrine Room of the hotel on New Year's Day, 2012, with compassion prayers and the correct practice of the mantra 'om ma ni padme hung' the \\"concentrated expression of compassion\\". Continuing with tuition over regular phone calls from Slade's home in Whitstable to Lama Nima Tshering on his mobile phone in Bhutan, and on her trips back to the Himalayan Kingdom, Slade plunged into her studies. Her Lama suggested that she 'change her dress', swapping western clothes for the robes of a Buddhist monastic in 2012; she had already shaved her head. She was given the name Ani (meaning 'nun') Pema (Lotus) Deki (Blissful) in a 2013 naming ceremony performed by her Lama's teacher, Rinpoche Gyalsey Tenzin Radgye. Naming was a great honour, but she had yet to qualify as a nun. Becoming a nun was an avenue that Slade had assumed was closed to her, because she was bringing up her son in England and would not be able to complete the necessary retreats required to perform the qualifying practices. Making an unprecedented suggestion, Lama Nima Tshering told Slade/Pema Deki that whilst she must continue caring for her son, she had \\"the mind of a nun.\\" So she set about the fitting in the necessary Ngöndro (involving four sets of one hundred and ten thousand practises that combine visualisations, prayer and movement), with the demands of her daily life in Whitstable. Returning to Bhutan with her seven- year-old son in February 2014, Slade became the first (and as of 2018) the only Western woman to be ordained as a Buddhist nun in that country. Rinpoche Dorji Lopen, \\"the number two in the monastic structure in Bhutan\\" and who had performed the ceremony in which her Lama gave his vows, performed Slade's ordination ceremony. Continuing to study with her teacher in Bhutan and learning classical Tibetan – the language of the Buddhist texts – Slade explores the answers to her questions about their teachings, study and practise. Charity CEO / founder of Opening Your Heart to Bhutan Following a visit to Meritsemo, a small village in rural, remote Southwestern Bhutan, in April 2015, Slade set up a fundraising initiative with the help of one of her yoga students in Whitstable, Adrienne Shaw. Their mutual friend, Simon Knibbs (an IT specialist), set up the website, and they raised money initially to install cold showers and toilets in the local monastery before widening their operations to help the entire village, including improving facilities for the local school. Opening Your Heart to Bhutan was inaugurated as a British charity in 2016, helping children both with and without special needs across the country. It focuses on providing access to (and training to ensure) safe medical care and to education (including building a school for \\"specially abled Bhutanese children\\"). It supplies disability aids and basic amenities and sets up educational projects. After meeting some of the children directly benefiting from Slade's endeavours, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge subsequently met with Slade and discussed her work at a reception with the King and Queen of Bhutan at the Taj Tashi Hotel in Thimphu in April 2016. The charity's work is ongoing and effective thanks to expert local knowledge and Slade's own expertise in financial analysis. According to Slade, \\"No one is paid to run the charity and costs are kept at a bare minimum to maximise funds going directly to those most in need.\\" Opening Your Heart to Bhutan benefits from the entire proceeds from the sales of Slade's autobiography, Set Free: A Life-Changing Journey From Banking to Buddhism in Bhutan, written on the suggestion of one of her yoga students and with the blessing of her Lama. Author Slade's autobiography, Set Free: A Life-Changing Journey From Banking to Buddhism in Bhutan, written between April and October 2015, was published by Summersdale in April 2017. Also featuring Slade's ten teachings for everyday living, by May of that year it had hit the number one spot in both the Amazon Charts' 'Philosophy Biography' and 'Travel Writing' categories and number 6 in books overall. It has garnered positive reviews from press across the globe. Slade was recorded reading the text for the audio book release, and the title has been translated into Czech, Hungarian, and German. It is due for release in Italian in 2019. Public speaking As a public speaker, Slade has given talks internationally, including at the Foreign Correspondents Club In Hong Kong on 6 November 2017, and the Oxford Human Rights Festival in 2018. Her TEDx Talk in January 2017 took place in Sevenoaks Kent. Awards and recognition Emma Slade was awarded the British Prime Minister's Points of Light Award for her services to Bhutan. She received it from the British Honorary Consul Michael Rutland OBE and Lyonpo Damcho Dorji, Bhutan's Minister for Foreign Affairs, in a ceremony at the Drakstsho School for Special Children (which is supported by her charity) in Thimphu in January 2017. Rutland said: Slade was also short-listed for the Asian Voice Charity Award for \\"Most Inspiring Individual in Charity\\" in January 2018. As the subject of a short film, \\"Happiness,\\" Slade discusses her experience and understanding about what makes us happy, and suggests how this might be achieved. Produced by Green Lions, \\"Happiness\\" was part of a school project set up by the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford to raise awareness about the importance of compassion and its different aspects. Regarding compassion, Slade told Laignee Barron of Time magazine: \\"Mindfulness makes you calmer. Compassion makes you happier. I'm always going to encourage people to help others as a route to happiness. I believe in the transformative power of compassion.\\" Slade has appeared on radio and television in the UK, including in 2017 on Clare Balding's Sunday morning Radio 2 Show, with Davina McCall on Davina Hour, and Nicky Campbell's Big Questions. Personal life Slade's long-term relationship with an English sculptor, during which they lived together in Whitstable, Kent, ended in 2005 amidst complications that included Slade being informed that she was biologically unable to have children. Slade gave up teaching yoga to return to banking in London. There she met Mark, a fellow banker, and the two embarked on a brief relationship. As this ran its course, Slade discovered that she was pregnant. Though the couple are no longer together, their son Oscar was born in September 2006. Remaining friends, the two share parenting. Slade lives in Whitstable, Kent, teaching yoga and meditation. She continues to study Buddhist philosophy with Lama Nima Tshering and raises money for and runs her charity, Opening Your Heart to Bhutan, returning regularly to that country.

The Find X features a different design from traditional smartphones, as it has a mechanic pop-up camera. The phone has a screen to body ratio of 87%, the thinnest bezels in the market when it launched, and is considered the first \\"all screen\\" smartphone to be released. Specifications Hardware It is powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor, 8 GB of RAM, 256 GB of storage and operates on Android 8.1 (Oreo) which is Color OS customised. The pop up contains both the 25 MP front camera and dual 16 + 20 MP rear cameras. It also has a 3,730 mAh battery and is powered by VOOC fast wired charging. The Lamborghini edition of the phone comes with 512 GB storage and supports SuperVOOC fast wired charging which can charge from 0 to 100% in 35 minutes. According to Oppo, Find X will be its first phone to have global LTE compatibility which is crucial for the company to enter the European and North American market, the phone supports no fingerprint scanner to unlock the device and instead relies on facial recognition known as O-Face, which is done by the pop up taking as little as 0.5 s to pop up and unlock the phone. It is the first phone to feature an entirely virtualized (software-driven) proximity sensor, as there was no space on the front face to include such a physical sensor. The selfie camera has 3D Smart Selfie Capture that can simulate various lighting effects for portrait lighting and it has an 3D OMoji feature while the dual rear camera can recognize 800 scenes in 20 scenarios (Food, Pets, Snow, etc.).

The simultaneous sampling at higher latitudes was carried out by the Explorer 54 spacecraft until its failure on January 29, 1976, and then by Explorer 51, until it reentered on December 12, 1978. The same type of spacecraft as Explorer 51 was used, and the payload consisted of the same types of instruments except that the low-energy electron and UV nitric oxide experiments were deleted and a backscatter UV spectrometer was added to monitor the ozone content of the atmosphere. The 2 experiments that were deleted were more appropriate for the high-latitude regions.

A scion of the noble House of Neville, he was a son of Thomas Neville of Brancepeth and a nephew of Ralph Neville, 2nd Earl of Westmorland, and belonged to a senior but disinherited branch of the family. Humphrey and his family supported the House of Lancaster during the Wars of the Roses, while his junior but richer Neville cousins, chiefly represented the famous Earl of Warwick, supported the House of York. Humphrey almost single-handedly led the Lancastrian resistance during the early years of the reign of Edward IV, until he was executed in 1469, in the king's presence. Family Humphrey is said to have been born in 1439 at Slingsby Manor, near Malton, in Yorkshire. He was the eldest son and heir of sir Thomas Neville of Brancepeth (d. c. 1459) by Elizabeth, daughter of Henry Beaumont, 5th Baron Beaumont (d. 1413). He had a younger brother, Charles, and also an illegitimate one, George. Thomas Neville and his brothers, the Earl of Westmorland and Lord Neville (Humphrey's uncles), were sons of John Neville (d. 1420), the eldest son and heir of Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland, a powerful magnate from northern England. The earl's remarriage to Joan Beaufort, a sister of Henry IV, prompted him to disinherit John, his eldest son, in favour of his issue by Joan, the eldest of which was Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury. Upon Ralph Neville's death, most of the Neville family estates went to Joan Beaufort and her children. The senior Neville branch disputed their disinheritance, resulting in the Neville–Neville feud with the Earl of Salisbury. The dispute became entangled in the Wars of the Roses, with Salisbury and his son Warwick supporting the Yorkists while the senior branch supported the Lancastrians. The 2nd Earl of Westmorland became incapacitated and so the family cause was taken by his brothers. Humphrey's father Thomas died early in the conflict, while his uncle, Lord Neville, was killed at the Battle of Towton in 1461. Life account Humphrey shared the Lancastrian sentiments of the elder branch of the house of Neville, the offspring of Westmorland's first marriage, and he declared for Henry VI when, on 26 June 1461, he, with Lord Roos and others, made a descent into Durham as far as Brancepeth from Scotland, whither he had fled after Towton. Neville, who is described as 'esquire of Brancepeth', and filled the office of bailiff of Hexham, was captured and attainted in the parliament held in the following November. A Thomas Neville, clerk of Brancepeth, also attainted for the same offence, was no doubt a relative. Humphrey remained some time in the Tower, but ultimately managed to break out, and, returning to Northumberland, 'made commotion of people against our sovereign lord the king [Edward IV]'. But finally suing for pardon, the king, 'having respect to his birth,' took him into his grace by letters patent, and he was knighted. The family influence had doubtless been exerted in his favour. Nevertheless, in April 1464, Sir Humphrey Neville was again in arms with the Lancastrians at Bamburgh Castle, and, with eighty spearmen and some archers, lay in ambush in a wood near Newcastle for his distant cousin, John Neville, Lord Montagu, who was on his way to the border to escort the Scottish peace commissioners to York. But Montagu, warned in time, escaped the snare. Sir Humphrey would seem to have fought at the Battle of Hexham, and, flying southwards, took refuge in a cave on the banks of the Derwent, which here for some distance forms the boundary between Northumberland and Durham. He and Sir Ralph Grey, the defender of Bamburgh Castle, were alone excepted from the amnesty proclaimed on 11 June, and one contemporary document, printed in the notes to Warkworth's 'Chronicle', almost implies that he, too, was in Bamburgh. But, as Bamburgh surrendered to the Earl of Warwick at the end of June, this is improbable. Humphrey Neville is said to have remained in his cave, leading the life of a freebooter for five years, until, in the summer of 1469, Edward IV fell into the hands of the Earl of Warwick and was carried captive into the north. The Lancastrians had given their assistance to the movement against Edward, and were apparently dissatisfied with the use Warwick made of his victory. Sir Humphrey, whose attainder had been renewed in January 1465, once more came forward and raised the standard of revolt on the border. Warwick had to release the king before he could get forces to follow him against Neville, but then easily suppressed the rising. Humphrey and his brother Charles were captured, carried to York, and executed there on 29 September in the presence of Edward IV. The Latin extract quoted by Surtees without giving his authority, according to which Neville was captured in Holderness, may possibly contain a confusion of the Yorkshire with the Durham Derwent. According to Surtees, Neville left a son, Arthur Neville (d. circ. 1502) of Scole Acle, who had two sons: Ralph Neville of Scole Acle and Coveshouses, in Weardale; and Lancelot Neville, who married Anne, daughter of Rowland Tempest of Holmeside. Ralph Neville's grandson, Ralph Neville, died in 1615, leaving only a daughter Anne, and with her this branch of the Nevilles, the Nevilles of Weardale, seems to have died out.

Born in Mallow, County Cork, McDonnell began working in the local Érin Foods factory. He joined the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union (ITGWU), and in 1974 was elected as secretary of his local branch. He focused on supporting union members in the food processing, local authority and health industries, and gradually came to national prominence. In his spare time, he completed a degree in economic and history with University College Cork. The ITGWU became part of SIPTU in 1990, and McDonnell was appointed as its south west regional officer, the largest region in the union. McDonnell stood to become general secretary of SIPTU in 1997, defeating Brendan Hayes and Carolann Duggan. Along with Hayes, he was considered part of the \\"mainstream\\" of the union. The first leader of SIPTU to be elected when not living in Dublin, McDonnell benefited from an 80% turnout among members in his south west region, but also won in some other areas, such as many Dublin branches. As leader, McDonnell prioritised expanding the social partnership programme, believing that the unions could win more concessions, such as a £5 minimum wage and mandatory union recognition. Because SIPTU, at the time, expected leaders to retire when they reached the age of sixty, he committed from the start to serving a single five-year term. In 2001, McDonnell was additionally elected as treasurer of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU). After retiring from his union posts in 2003, the ICTU nominated him to serve on the board of Fáilte Ireland, the tourism development agency.

During the Euromaidan she worked as a medic in the Kyiv-2 battalion and saw combat in the city of Debaltseve after it was taken over by Russian-aligned rebels in 2015. She was killed in an ambush by unknown attackers on 30 October 2017. Her husband Adam Osmaev, a leader of the Dzhokhar Dudayev Battalion, was injured in the ambush but survived.  Early life  Okueva was born an only child in Odessa in 1983 to a Chechen father and a Polish mother from the North Caucasus. Okueva stated that she did not know her father due to his early death. She lived with her family in Moscow and Grozny before moving back to Ukraine in 2003 after fighting on the side of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria the Second Chechen War, having converted to Islam at the age of 17. Then she changed her name. First name of Amina Okueva was Natalia Nikiforova. After she married Isa Mustafinov, she changed her name to Amina. She became Okueva after her second marriage and did not change her name any more. Upon arrival in Ukraine she enrolled at the Odessa National Medical University where she specialized in general surgery before working as an intern at a local hospital. She was married three times; her first husband, Isa Mustafinov, whom she married in 2000, died in 2003 during the Second Chechen war. Islam Tukhashev, her second husband, was deported from Ukraine for illegally staying in the country and was later sentenced to life imprisonment in Russia for the murder of Russian intelligence officers in Ingushetia; due to his residency status the marriage was not registered in Ukraine. In 2009 she met Adam Osmaev, who is currently accused of attempting to assassinate Vladimir Putin; they later had a wedding ceremony but did not officially register the marriage.  Euromaidan, military, and political activities  After the start of Euromaidan she joined a unit of Afghanistan veterans by staffing a medical tent during the protests. She joined the \\"Kyiv-2\\" battalion to serve as a paramedic in Eastern Ukraine after the start of the conflict, but she did not practice medicine much while she was there, and directly participated in the Battle of Debaltseve in Luhansk Oblast. She also served as press secretary for the Dhozkhar Dudaev International Peacekeeping Battalion. She ran in the 2014 Parliamentary election as a self- nominated candidate in the Suvorovskyi Raion of Odessa while she was a police officer of the Ministry of Internal Affairs; she received only 3.72% of the vote, putting her in ninth place.  Attempted assassination  A man masquerading as a French journalist from Le Monde opened fire on Okueva and her husband while they were in their car on Kyrylivska Street in Kyiv on 1 June 2017. In the attack her husband was seriously injured but she was not, and in the process managed to fire four rounds into the attacker; the police were able to detain the suspect and begin proceeding, in which they initially identified him not as a French journalist but as a citizen of Ukraine by the name of Aleksander Dakar; he was later identified as Arthur Abdulayevich Denisultanov, who is suspected of killing Umar Israilov, a former bodyguard of Ramzan Kadyrov; Israilov had accused Kadyrov of supporting human rights violations. Arthur Denisultanov was, as part of a prisoner exchange, released and handed over to the Donetsk People's Republic on 29 December 2019.  Death  Okueva was killed in a military-style ambush on 30 October 2017 near the village of Hlevakha, Kyiv Oblast. Unidentified attackers opened fire on the car containing her and her husband while it slowed by a railroad crossing, firing five rounds into her including two fatal rounds into her head. Her husband Osmaev was only injured in the leg and began first aid before calling for emergency services and driving away, but was not successful in his efforts to save her. Spokesman for the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine stated that the Russian military may have been involved, although the identity of the attackers remains unknown. Okueva was buried was buried in Dnipro in the Muslim section of the Krasnopil cemetery near the Dnieper A memorial sign in honor of Isa Munayev was unveiled in Dnipro, Radio Free Europe (7 August 2018) on 1 November 2017, next to the grave of Isa Munayev, where she stated in her will she wanted to be buried. Her family did not attend the public farewell ceremony fearing that the event could become a target for an attack, and the funeral itself took place under armed guard. In November 2019 the Kyiv City Council decided to rename the Projectna Street in Kyiv's Shevchenkivskyi District after Okueva as part of Ukraine's national decommunization process. In Kyiv, they decided to name the streets in honor of Okueva and Abolmasov, The Ukrainian Week (12 November 2019) In June 2020 the Dnipro city council decided a new street in the city's Amur-Nyzhnodniprovskyi District wil be named after Okueva; an earlier attempt to rename the local Populus Street in her honour had not been supported by its residents.

It has leathery, oblong to wedge- shaped leaves of about 7½ cm long and 2½ cm wide, deeply incised near the tip with seven to ten teeth. It has initially yellow, later carmine coloured flower heads. The 2 cm long bracts have slender, recurved tips. From the center of the perianth emerge long styles that jointly give the impression of a pincushion. It is called Robinson pincushion in English and Robinson- kreupelhout in Afrikaans. Flowers can be found between September and December. It naturally occurs in the south of South Africa.  Description  Leucospermum pluridens is an upright, rigid, evergreen tree-like shrub of up to 3 m (10 ft) in diameter, that emerges from a woody trunk of up to 20 cm (8 in) in diameter. The trunk and lower branches are covered by a smooth grey bark. Characteristically, young plants branch only sparsely from the stiff upright stem, but older plants develop more branches. The flowering branches are stout and woody, ¾–1 cm (0.3–0.4 in) across, with a thick grey felty or spiderweb-like covering consisting of short cringy hairs. The leaves are set alternately and slightly overlapping, hairless and leathery, oblong or broadly inverted lance-shaped to wedge-shaped, 5½–10 cm (2¼–4 in) long and 2–3½ cm (0.8–1.4 in) wide. The tip of the leaf is rounded, often deeply incised and bears seven to ten very prominent rounded teeth. The flowerheads are egg- shaped, about 8 cm (3¼ in) high and 6 cm (2.4 in) across, seated or have a very short stalk, mostly individual but sometimes grouped with up to four together on a flowering branch. The common base of the flowers in the same head are narrowly cone-shaped with a pointy tip, 3½–4 cm (1.4–1.6 in) long and about 1 cm (0.4 in) wide. The bracts subtending the head are oval, keeled, with a very long narrowing and hook-shaped tip, up to 2 cm (0.8 in) long, with a row of long hairs along the edges, the inner surface shiny and carmine- coloured in living specimens. The bract subtending the individual flower is cartilaginous in consistency, keeled and wraps around the base of the flower, about 1 cm long and 6 mm wide, with long pointed tip that curves slightly inwards and with a row of long hairs along the edges. The perianth is 4-merous. The lower part of the perianth called tube, that remains merged when the flower is open, is about 10 mm (0.40 in) long, cylinder-shaped, somewhat compressed sideways, hairless at its foot and slightly powdery higher up. The middle part (or claws) is initially yellow, becoming bright carmine, roughly hairy on the inner surface, with long straight hairs between short felty hairs. The claw facing the middle of is hairless near the base. The upper part (or limbs), which enclosed the pollen presenter in the bud, are broadly lance- shaped with a pointy tip, each about 5 mm long and 2 mm wide, felty, those facing the centre of the head and the sides with in addition long silky hairs. The limb facing the edge of the head is less densely felty than the other three. From the centre of the perianth emerges a slender tapering and the upper part slightly curved to the center of the head, style of 5–6 cm (2.0–2.4 in) long and about 1½ mm thick. The thickened part at the tip of the style called pollen presenter is orange in the lower half and yellow in the upper half, cone-shaped with a pointy tip, about 2 mm (0.08 in) long and 1 mm wide long, with a green groove that functions as the stigma across the very tip. The ovary is subtended by four white, awl-shaped scales of about 2 mm (0.08 in) long.  Differences with other species  Leucospermum pluridens differs from its close relative Leucospermum glabrum because it has felty to spiderweb-like, grey indumentum on the flowering branches, the pointy, narrowly cone-shaped acute common base of the flower head, exceptionally long (up to 2 cm) bracts subtending the flower with a long pointed and recurved tip and edges with a row of long hears and leaves with six to nine deep incisions.  Taxonomy  As far as we know, Margaret Levyns was the first to collect of the Robinson pincushion in 1938 on the Rooiberg Pass, south of Calitzdorp. Since it also can be found on the north facing slopes of the Outeniqua Mountains near the Attaquas Kloof, which was traveled by Francis Masson, Carl Peter Thunberg and other collectors, it is curious that this striking shrub seems to have been overlooked for a very long time. John Patrick Rourke realised it was a new species, which he described in 1970 and called Leucospermum pluridens. Leucospermum pluridens is assigned to the tree pincushions, section Conocarpodendron. The species name pluridens is a compounding of the Latin words pluris meaning \\"many\\" and dens meaning \\"teeth\\".  Distribution, habitat and ecology  The Robinson pincushion grows on the lower northern slopes of the Outeniqua Mountains near \\"Klein Moeras Rivier Spruiten\\", Saffraan Rivier and Kruis Pad, at 500–600 m (1600–2000 ft), and on the southeastern slopes of the Rooiberg at an altitude of 750–1050 m (2500–3500 ft). On both locations, the species occur, in the so-called Arid Fynbos, a transitional vegetation type on the interface between fynbos and Karoo. This is most evidently demonstrated at Kruis Pad where this species can be found associated with Aloe ferox and several Cotyledon, Elytropappus, and Restionaceae on dry, hot, north facing hills. Within the distribution of the Robinson pincushion the average annual precipitation is 250–400 mm. This makes the requirements (10–15 in annual precipitation) of L. pluridens quite different from those of its close relative, L. glabrum. The species also grows in the Baviaanskloof. The fruits are ripe about two months after flowering, when they fall to the ground. Here they are gathered by ants that carry them to their underground nest, where they remain until they germinate after a fire has removed the overhead vegetation cover.  Conservation  The Robinson pincushion is considered near threatened. Its distribution is severely fragmented, restricted to an area of . For unknown reasons, its population size has declined in the past, but seems to have stabilised now.

He was a co-founder of the Behavior Genetics Association. Early life and education Ginsburg was born on July 16, 1918 in Detroit, Michigan. His parents, Sonia and Morris Ginsburg, were both recently arrived Jewish immigrants from Russia. He received his undergraduate education at Wayne State University, where he was originally a journalism major, before switching to majoring in English, and then becoming a biology major in the second semester of his junior year. He graduated from Wayne State cum laude in 1939, and received his master's degree from there in 1941. He then enrolled in a summer class in zoology at the University of Chicago, where he received his Ph.D. in 1943 under the supervision of Sewall Wright. Career Ginsburg joined the faculty of the University of Chicago in 1946, where he helped develop an undergraduate natural science program, of which he was later the chair. Also in 1946, he and his family began taking summer trips to Bar Harbor, Maine, and he began conducting research at the Jackson Laboratory in mice and rabbits. He continued to conduct research at the Jackson Laboratory every summer until the 1980s. In 1963, he was appointed the William Rainey Harper Professor of Biology at the University of Chicago, a position he held until leaving the university's faculty in 1968. That year, he joined the faculty of the University of Connecticut, where he co-founded the Department of Biobehavioral Sciences in 1969. He headed this department from 1969 to 1985. He played a major role in founding the Behavior Genetics Association, and hosted its first meeting on the University of Connecticut's campus in 1971. He retired from the University of Connecticut in 1997, after which he became an emeritus professor there; he remained an active researcher even after his retirement. Research Ginsburg conducted research in many different animal species, including fruit flies, dogs, mice, and humans. Early in his career, while at the University of Chicago, he began researching the behavior genetics of mice before moving to research coyotes and subsequently wolves. His initial goal was to breed wolves that did not display the aggressive behavior characteristic of their wild counterparts. He subsequently continued this research at the University of Connecticut, where he started the Wolf Project in a protected enclosure on the university's campus. This nine- year project aimed, among other things, to assess the behavioral factors that underlie mating dynamics in wolves. Honors and awards Ginsburg was a two- time fellow of the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences: once in 1956 and once in 1965. He was also a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Psychological Society, the Animal Behavior Society, and the International Society for Research on Aggression. In 1980, he received the Dobzhansky Memorial Award from the Behavior Genetics Association. In 2001, he received the International Behavioral and Neural Genetics Society's Award for pioneering and continuing contributions to the field. Personal life and death Ginsburg married Pearl on August 29, 1941; they were married until her death in 1998. They had three children: Judy, Deborah, and Faye. Benson Ginsburg died on August 17, 2016 in Storrs, Connecticut, at the age of 98.

Rose reportedly had gunshot residue on his hand. Allegheny County Medical Examiner Daniel Wolfe said the residue was not necessarily the result of Rose firing a gun and could have come from Rosfeld’s weapon. He was transported to McKeesport Hospital where he was later declared deceased. Following the shooting, Rosfeld was charged with criminal homicide. After a 4-day trial, Rosfeld was acquitted on all counts. Background Rose was 17 years old when he died. He had worked as a community volunteer and was a student at Woodland Hills High School, where he took Advanced Placement classes. According to the family attorney, Rose had no significant criminal record prior to his death. His mother had been a clerk for another police department. His maternal grandfather had been a police officer for more than 35 years in a different jurisdiction. Rosfeld had been sworn in to the East Pittsburgh Police Department only a few hours before the shooting, and trained with the department for three weeks prior. He had seven years experience with other police departments, including those in the Pennsylvania towns of Oakmont and Harmar, and the University of Pittsburgh. Rosfeld left the University of Pittsburgh “after discrepancies were found between one of his sworn statements and evidence in an arrest.“ Shooting On Tuesday June 19, 2018, there was a drive-by shooting in North Braddock around 8:30 p.m. Just 10 minutes later, police stopped a car matching witness descriptions of the silver Chevrolet Cruze used in the drive-by shooting. The police observed bullet holes on the side of the car. A video recording taken by a bystander shows police ordering the driver to step out from the car. While the driver was being handcuffed, Rose and the third occupant, Zaijuan Hester, ran from the car. Rosfeld fired three rounds, and Rose was struck by all three. He was pronounced dead at McKeesport Hospital. In the video, a woman's voice is heard saying, \\"Why they shooting at him? All they did was run, and they shooting at them.\\" [sic] Police said that Rose had been unarmed when he was shot. Hester escaped, but was later arrested.  Earlier drive-by shooting  Hester was charged with the drive by shooting. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette published video footage showing Rose in the front passenger seat of a Chevrolet Cruze, while Hester fired through the rear window behind him. Contradicting that video evidence, drive-by victim William Ross told investigators on January 17, 2019 that Rose was in fact the individual who had shot him: \\"The beef was between me and him, that car came by, he shot me, I ran to the store.\\" Allegheny County District Attorney Stephen Zappala stated that Rose had an empty 9-millimeter handgun magazine in his pocket, and officials stated there were two guns in the car, a 9-millimeter handgun and a .40-caliber handgun. According to police, Hester had fired the .40-caliber handgun. Trial testimony from a scientist at the Allegheny County Medical Examiner’s Office showed that Rose had gunshot residue on his hands at the time he was shot and his DNA was found on the 9mm pistol found under the passenger seat. Allegheny County Medical Examiner Daniel Wolfe said the residue didn’t necessarily mean Rose fired a gun. During the trial, Rosfeld's attorney additionally claimed that Rose had stolen one of the handguns found in the car during an armed robbery of his employer just hours before he was shot. However, this was ruled inadmissible by Judge Alexander Bicket, as information regarding the gun theft was unknown to Rosfeld when he conducted the felony traffic stop. Indictments Rosfeld was placed on leave and the Allegheny County Police Department began an investigation. The Allegheny County Medical Examiner's Office later classified Rose's death as a homicide and said that Rose died of a gunshot wound to the torso. On June 26, Rosfeld was arrested and charged with criminal homicide, after detectives stated that there were inconsistencies in the officer's testimony. Rosfeld was released on bail by the district judges overseeing the case and according to authorities appeared remorseful during interviews. Rosfeld was charged with criminal homicide, was arraigned, and had unsecured bail set at $250,000. His trial began on March 19, 2019 and concluded on March 22, 2019. Rosfeld was found not guilty of criminal homicide. Hester was arrested on June 26, 2018 and detained at the Shuman Juvenile Detention Center. Police stated that Hester had been on juvenile probation and had cut his ankle bracelet. Hester was charged with aggravated assault, criminal homicide, receiving stolen property, and firearm charges. Reactions The Washington Post reported that Rose was the first person killed by the East Pittsburgh Police Department since at least 2015. On June 25, Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto told reporters \\"there should be a trial” before a jury regarding the death of the young man and the fate of the police officer. On July 30, it was calculated that the Pittsburgh Police force paid out over $1 million in overtime for forces who monitored protests.  Protests  = June 2018 = Protests attended by hundreds of people were held on June 20 and June 21 in front of the Allegheny County Courthouse in Downtown Pittsburgh. On the night of June 22, protestors marching on the Parkway East freeway slowed traffic for miles; subsequent protests took place near PNC Park on Pittsburgh's North Shore and in Pittsburgh's South Side neighborhood. A visiting for Rose was held on June 24, and his funeral held at the Woodland Hills Middle School on June 25. = July 2018 = The preliminary hearing for the officer was relocated to the Allegheny County Courthouse due to security concerns given the continued protests in the city. On July 8, while protesting on Route 30 in North Versailles, four protestors were hit by a car that drove through the march. One person was arrested and one person was taken to the hospital. The protests continued, with the goal of bringing visibility to and awareness of the shooting. On July 26, Pittsburgh city officials issued a new protest policy due to continued disruption of the city's roadways and bridges. This policy does not prohibit protests, but does prohibit unpermitted protestors from blocking traffic or shutting down specific \\"red zone\\" areas, and during limited high-traffic times in \\"yellow zone\\" areas. On July 27, protestors at Grant Street and Forbes Avenue confronted the Public Safety Director and Police Chief. One of the protestors, Nicky Jo Dawson, complained that the new policy \\"put further restrictions on people who are peacefully protesting against an oppressive system.\\" = March 2019 = Following the trial of Rosfeld, multiple demonstrations took place. The largest was three days after the trial on March 25, in which over a thousand people marched through the streets of Downtown Pittsburgh. The march was escorted by the police. This protest coincided with a walkout of schools and universities, including Chatham University, the University of Pittsburgh, Taylor Allderdice High School, and Obama Academy. Smaller protests took place after, in which protestors occupied businesses and disrupted traffic.  2018 Community birthday celebration  On July 12, 2018, members of Rose's community in Rankin, Pennsylvania came together to celebrate his 18th birthday. The celebration was motivated by his mother as a way to bring the community together. The event offered food for participants, and the organizers donated 250 backpacks of books to members of the community.

Academic career She worked as a historical researcher from 1897 to 1900. In 1899 she was awarded the Alexander medal by the Royal Historical Society for her essay entitled 'The Relations of the Crown to Trade under James I.' In 1902 she wrote Volume 3 of the series 'English History Illustrated from Original Sources' covering the period from 1399-1485. Civil Service career From 1900 to 1907 she was co-founder of and served as honorary secretary of the Registry and Apprenticeship Committee of the Women's University Settlement in Southwark. From 1907 to 1915 she worked as an organiser and inspector for technical classes for women and trade schools under the London County Council Education Committee, and was on the Board of Education consultative committee from 1908 to 1913. There she was described as a woman of enthusiasm, industry and organising ability, and she developed the trade schools for girls to a high technical standard and took a major role in the successful reconstruction of evening institutes. In view of her expertise in job placement and technical training she was approached by the Board of Trade in 1915 to lead its wartime programme for substituting women's for men's labour. In 1916 she was appointed as chief woman inspector of the Labour Exchanges and Unemployment Insurance Department of the Board of Trade, which was transferred in 1917 to the Ministry of Labour, she was concerned with the recruitment of women for a wide range of activities, including the women's branches of the armed services, munitions work, agricultural labour and clerical work in government departments. The Times later accredited her as being, during the war,‘largely responsible for directing women's services in the Army, on munitions, and on the land.' For this work for the war effort she was awarded the CBE by George V in 1918. She was a strong believer in women's abilities and spent much energy and time attempting to secure a larger place for women in the work force in general and the Civil Service in particular. At the end of World War I she was put in charge of the Women's Training Department of the Ministry of Labour. In 1923 she was promoted to the post of assistant secretary, the first woman in the Civil Service to rise so high, and she was put in charge of the Juvenile Employment Section. In this role she established close contacts with industry and business and so could promote practical schemes for fostering the employment of young people. Retirement She retired from the Civil Service in 1933 and devoted her time to gardening and needlework as well as sitting as a co-opted member of the Education Committee of the Devon County Council until 1939.

The treaty sought to establish a date for war with France waged by an Anglo- Habsburg alliance. The treaty was between the English King Henry VIII and Spanish King and Holy Roman Emperor Charles V and signed by representatives of the interested parties and subject to papal agreement. Cardinal Thomas Wolsey was the chief representative for the Kingdom of England and Margaret of Savoy represented the Habsburg interests.  Terms of the Treaty  The treaty was a secret document that detailed plans for a war with France, conducted against them by an Anglo-Habsburg alliance, by March 1523. It demanded that from February 1522 each party was to make allowance for their leader's to be able to move freely across the Channel between England and the Habsburg Low Countries in order to raise money and men for the war. 3000 troops were recommended to complete the task of protecting the movements of Henry VIII and Charles V. Historian John Guy suggests the treaty detailed for a 'Great Enterprise' to be established between the two allies, as Charles V worked through French possessions in Italy and Henry VIII invaded Northern France itself. Both were to land with an agreed 10,000 cavalry and 30,000 troops, though the treaty makes specific provision for England to be able to use some of Charles V's forces in that figure. The allies were expected to meet their objectives by November or further action was to be taken, namely Papal interdicts. Charles V was even expected to finish his Italian efforts by the 15th May 1523.  Reality of the Treaty  Throughout the alliance's lifetime, the relationship between Henry VIII and Charles V was marked by English scepticism after Ferdinand II of Aragon let the English down in 1511. Though 1523 was the suggested start date, a small English expedition, led by the Earl of Surrey, assaulted Picardy in 1522 with little real consequence or notable victories. The offensive's date was delayed until 1524 through the 1522 Treaty of Windsor between Henry VIII and Charles V, possibly to further drain French finances being spent in Italy. In 1525 the 'Great Enterprise' was abandoned and the constantly oscillating foreign policy of Wolsey and Henry switched outlook towards France and away from Spain in the 1525 Treaty of the More.

The location today is the site of the district of Pachten in the municipality of Dillingen, Saarland. Origin Contiomagus was founded during the colonization phase after Caesar's conquest of Gaul from 58 to 51 BC. The location on the intersecting trunk roads Trier-Straßburg and Metz-Mainz as well as the existence of a ford across the Saar (Saravus) and the proximity to the valleys of Prims and Nied favored the development of Contiomagus. Coin finds indicate that the settlement originated around 10 BC and lasted for 200 years. The name of the place, \\"Contiomagus\\", consists of the Celtic word component \\"magus\\" (market) and the short form \\"Contio\\" for Condate/Confluentes (confluence). As a \\"confluence\\" one must assume the mouth of the Prims into the Saar, located in the immediate vicinity of Contiomagus. A similar name has the place Konz (Contionacum) at the mouth of the Saar into the Moselle. The route of the Roman road from Metz (Divodurum) to Mainz {Mogontiacum) ran through the Nied valley and crossed the Saar at Contiomagus, continuing along the banks of the Prims and the Theel via Lebach and Tholey to the Rhine. In 244 AD, the crossing of the Saar was improved by the construction of a wooden bridge at Contiomagus. The road from Trier (Augusta Treverorum) to Straßburg (Argentoratum) divided at Zerf. The southern route led from Beckingen along the Saar Valley and went via Contiomagus and Saarbrücken (vicus Saravus) to Straßburg, while the northern route passed through Tholey and Schwarzenacker, then rejoined with the Saar valley route. Both routes were connected via the cross-connections Contiomagus-Tholey and Saarbrücken-Schwarzenacker. Development There were already settlements of the Celtic tribe of the Treveri in the vicinity of today's Dillingen, around the Limberg, on the Prims, and at the mouth of the Nied at the arrival of the Romans. A sword from the late La Tène was found in 1967 in Pachten (Leipziger Ring). In the years 58–51 BC Caesar's troops conquered the area along the Saar. The region was located at the border between the Celtic tribes of the Treveri and the Mediomatrici. The names of the carvings of the \\"Pachtener Sitzsteine\\" (seating, presumably from a cult theater) suggest the settlement of both tribes in the Pachten area. Contiomagus was primarily a trading town. According to the testimony of Ausonius, a court official of Emperor Valentinian I (r.364–375), there was merchant shipping on the Saar. The chief locations were the bridges in Sarrebourg (pons Saravi), Saarbrücken and Pachten (Contiomagus). In the 3rd century, Contiomagus was threatened by the Germans, and 275–276 it was destroyed by the Franks at the beginning of the Migration Period. During reconstruction, a fort was built. Mercury Stone (Pachten Museum) In the Roman Empire, the Civitas of the Treveri, including Pachten, belonged to the province of Belgica Prima, with its provincial capital at Trier. The Treveri gradually assimilated Roman culture, the Celtic language maintained itself in the country well into the 4th century AD. Celtic religion mingled syncretistically with the Roman deities (the \\"Interpretatio Romana\\"). The custom of erecting votive stones to the gods was widespread. From Pachten two such stones have been preserved: the Contiomagus Stone and the Merkur Stone. The latter was found in 1847 on the first plowing of a marshy spot in the \\"Nachtweide\\". The inscription of the white sandstone sculpture (39 × 23 × 10 cm with a letter height of 3 cm) reads: DEO MERCVRIO C OLONI CRVTISIO NES FERVNT DE SVO PER DANN VM GIAMILLVM Translation: \\"The coloni of Crutisio had this [stone] erected to the god Mercury by Dannus Giamillus.\\" In the immediate vicinity lay the shards of urns, jugs and small consecration vessels. Coloni are tenant farmers who depend on a large landowner. From this it follows that at the time of the dedication of the stone a villa must have existed in Pachten or the immediate vicinity. The discovery of the sacred stone led to the assumption that the ancient name of today's Pachten was \\"Crutisio\\", but this assumption was refuted by the discovery of the Contiomagus stone. Contiomagus Stone (Pachten Museum) The Contiomagus stone was found during excavation work October 22, 1955. The stone had been re-used as the foundation stone of a corner tower of the fort of Contiomagus. The grayish-yellow sandstone is 66 × 45 × 28 cm with the height of the inscribed part 46 cm. The upper part of the stone of is broken off and missing. The existing relief piece presumably represents a seated goddess, who is dressed in a tunic, which has strong drapery. To the right of the goddess a small animal, perhaps a dog, is visible to the viewer. The inscription, whose letters have a height of about 4 cm, reads: . O . D . . T . PRITONAE . DI VINAE . SIVE . CA . . IONI . PRO . SALVTE VICANORUM . CONTI OMAGI . ENSIVMTER TINIUS . MODESTUS F . C . V . S . A possible translation might be: \\"To the divine Pritona or Ca…ioni for the safety of the inhabitants of Contiomagus Tertinius Modestus.\\" Pritona can be interpreted as a river goddess or goddess of trade. The first and last lines of the dedication are written in abbreviations and heavily weathered. During temporary storage of the find in Saarbrücken it was misused by workmen, out of ignorance, as a support for the processing of building materials and thereby suffered further damage. As a result, the scientific interpretation of the first and last lines is still controversial. Another indication of the veneration of Mercury in Pechten is the small sculpture of the god from years around the beginning of the 3rd century, discovered in 1961 during the excavation for construction of a factory. Statuettes of other Roman and Egyptian gods were also found. The following centuries brought a period of prosperity for Pachten, expressed by the size of the village and the number of excavation finds, especially in the cemetery. Long before archaeological research into the history of Pachten was undertaken, the existence of a Roman settlement was known. The Benedictine monk Dom Calmet in his 1757 history of Lorraine (Histoire de Lorraine) has an entry. In the following century, the Saarlouis judicial counselor and notary Nicolas Bernard Motte (Manuscrit tiré des archives même de Sarrelouis et de ses environs) studied Roman Pechten. The most intense and fundamental research on this period was done by Philipp Schmitt, who served as pastor in Dillingen from 1833 to 1848 (Der Kreis Saarlouis und seine nächste Umgebung unter den Römern und Kelten). During the great drought of 1842 by the growth differential he was able to trace numerous foundations of ancient Pachten's buildings in the meadows of former farming villages. Schmitt estimated a population of about 2000 people for Gallo-Roman Pachten. In 1865 Georg Balzer interpreted some of the foundations discovered by Schmitt as a Roman fort. In the years 1891 and 1935 systematic excavations of the Landesmuseum Trier took place in Pachten. They discovered an extensive Roman civil settlement between today's railways in the east and the Wilhelmstrasse area. Similarly, a Frankish graveyard was found near the medieval village church, probably in the vicinity of a late Roman burial ground. Bird statuette from a child's grave The Roman burial ground in the Margarethenstraße was discovered accidentally in 1950 and excavated by the Conservatory of Saarland through the 1960s. The excavations uncovered over 500 graves, each with three to 14 items grave goods. Of particular importance are the terracotta figures, which are probably all from children's graves and are interpreted as toys. During the construction work following the canalization of the Saar, in the summer of 1985, the remains of a Roman road were discovered that led from the Saar to the fort and the settlement, dating back to the second century AD. 2009 reconstruction of a tower of the Roman fort The peace of the Gallo-Roman vicus was severely disturbed by invasions of the Germans beginning in the 3rd century. Pachten was nearly razed to the ground during the invasion of the Franks in 275–6. Burnt layers and buried coin hoards, placed in the ground for safekeeping by the population, point to this troubled era. One such treasure with 4000 coins, probably from the middle of the 3rd century, was found in 1858. In the last third of the 3rd century the construction of a Roman fort led to a revival, which is marked by numerous finds. The fort had a width of 134 m in east-west direction and was 152 m long. The walls were 2.9 m thick. At all four corners were square towers (6.73 m) with a wall thickness of 2.25 m. In the years 1961-63 and 1965 a temple complex with cella and surrounding columned gallery was found within the fort, in the southeast corner. Seats from the cult theater (Saarlandmuseum Saarbrücken) A possible cult center is also suspected in the area of today's parish church of St. Maximinus. The fort was destroyed at the end of the 4th or the beginning of the 5th century. The sandstone blocks found in the fortifications between 1961 and 1963, measuring up to 2.6 m in length and featuring names in large lettering, were interpreted by the researchers as the seats of a small cult theater from the second half of the 2nd century, belonging to a temple complex. Mosaic floor from the Villa Hylborn (Museum Pachten) Outside the Roman Vicus, in the area of today's road between Dillingen and Beckingen, the old B 51, a large Roman complex of a villa with five buildings on Hylborn was excavated based on the discoveries by Philipp Schmitt in the 1970s. The complex was begun in Celtic times in 90 BC and lasted to 234 AD. The largest building has a length of 68 m. The rooms partly enjoyed hypocaust heating and black and white mosaic floors, which are decorated with right- and left-turning swastikas. The luxurious building facilities also included a wooden water pipe, whose hollowed oak trunks were connected with iron sleeves and supplied the system with fresh spring water. By tree-ring dating the water pipe could be dated to the year 163 AD. Ursus stone IN PACE QUI ESCIT UR SUS INNOCEN S QUI VIXIT AN III D XLVI Here rests in peace the innocent Ursus, aged 3 years and 46 days. The presence of Christians in Pachten is indicated by finds such as the Ursus Stone, the tombstone of a three-year-old boy, discovered in the old church. The special meaning of the stone lies in the Chi Rho monogram XP, which was surrounded by two pigeons carved on the stone, in contrast to the other inscriptions. Such inscriptions are very rare in rural areas, since Christianity developed there later than in urban settlements. The peculiar orientation of the church to south-southwest-north-northeast, in the direction of the old Roman road, and the patronage of Maximin of Trier, who died in 346, indicate that already in late antiquity there was a Christian church in Pachten. When the later Romanesque church was torn down for construction of a Neo-gothic church in 1891 tombs from the Merovingian period were also discovered. These Frankish- Merovingian tombs were fenced with Roman stones. Based on further grave finds in the vicinity of today's church it appears that Pachten in the post-Roman period, lay in ruins only a short time, if at all, and was repopulated by at least the 7th century. Finds Systematic investigations in the 20th century have to date uncovered more than 560 graves and the remains of temples, theaters, villas and houses. Most date to the third and fourth centuries AD. A wealth of glass, metal objects, remains of colored wall plaster, heaters, and pottery attest to prosperity. During construction work on the Dillinger Hütte site a grave was found in 2009 documenting the change from Celtic to Roman ways of life.Saarbrücker Zeitung vom 23. Juni 2009 The replica of the tombstone of a child attached to the church of St. Maximin in Pachten shows symbols of the role of Christianity at that time. One of the 16 towers of the fort was rebuilt in 2009. Many finds are on display in the Museum Pachten. Further reading * Glansdorp, Edith: Das Gräberfeld „Margarethenstraße“ in Dillingen-Pachten.

Securities and Exchange Commission, 585 U.S. ___ (2018), was a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States on the status of administrative law judges of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Court held that they are considered inferior officers of the United States and so are subject to the Appointments Clause and must be appointed through the President or other delegated officer of the United States, rather than hired.. As \\"inferior\\" officers, their appointments are not subject to the Senate's advice and consent role.  Background  Like many other government agencies, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) uses administrative law judges (ALJ) to act as a judge in resolving disputes for the agency related to administrative law, those laws that describe how the agency is run. Prior to this case, through November 2017, the SEC had selected ALJ through an in-house hiring process, without seeking consult of the President or officers. The case and the election of President Donald Trump, which put more pressure on the use of ALJs in the government made the SEC formally announce on November 20, 2017, that they would be appointed by its five commissioners to align with the Constitution's Appointments Clause and eliminate the constitutionality questions raised by this case. In 2012, investment adviser Ray Lucia promoted a retirement investment strategy called \\"Buckets of Money\\" through several seminars. The SEC believed Lucia was offering misleading information in the presentations and charged Lucia and his investment company under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. SEC ALJ Cameron Elliot was assigned the case, and after hearings, ruled against Lucia, fining him and barring him for life for participating in the investment industry. Lucia appealed the case to the SEC, arguing that Elliot's position was considered an \\"officer of the United States\\" by being able to pass judgement and, as per the Appointments Clause, must be appointed to that position by the President or other officers with delegated authority to do so; Elliot had not gone through such a process. As such, Lucia argued that Judge Elliot was not empowered to issue the ruling. The SEC rejected Lucia's claim that ALJs were officers of the United States; the ALJs used by SEC may issue decisions with significant ramifications for those charged, but the decisions are reviewed by the SEC Commissioners, who are appointed by the President, before they are approved and implemented. To the SEC, they considered that the ALJs, to fulfill their duties, needed to be only employees of the agency, as was the case with Judge Elliot, and did not need to be appointed, it and dismissed Lucia's appeal. Lucia's argument was not the first time the question of ALJ's status had been raised in courts, but in at least two previous cases, the United States courts of appeals had ruled that the question was a matter of administrative review, not a constitutional question. Lucia's case at the SEC led one of the SEC commissioners hearing the case to question whether ALJ must be appointed or not. Lucia appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which also aligned with the SEC in that ALJs did not serve officers of the United States. Upon an en banc hearing within the Court of Appeals, the full ten- member panel was split, forcing them to issue a per curiam decision that maintained the SEC's stance. Supreme Court Lucia petitioned to the Supreme Court for writ of certiorari in July 2017 and asked to rule if ALJs are officers of the United States and so are subject to the Appointments Clause. The Court granted to hear the case in January 2018, with oral arguments set for April 23, 2018. During the case's review in lower courts, the United States government had backed the SEC's stance. With the election of Donald Trump as President, the government's stance had changed to favoring the argument that ALJs should be appointed. The SEC had already changed its process of hiring ALJs prior to the Supreme Court decision by requiring appointments to be approved by a vote of the Commission. In its brief to the Supreme Court, the government also held the stance that as ALJs should be appointed and able to be dismissed at the discretion of the President or other delegated officer. The Court did not consider that question during oral hearings and internal debates. Decision The Court announced judgment in favor of Lucia on June 21, 2018, reversing and remanding to the circuit court by 7–2. The decision affirmed Lucia's statement that ALJs are officers of the United States since they are effectively given quasi-judicial executive power and so must be appointed by the President or a delegated officer. The Court ruled that Lucia must now have a new hearing before a different, properly- appointed officer from the SEC but otherwise did not comment on any other aspect of the case. The majority opinion was written by Justice Elena Kagan and was joined by Chief Justice John Roberts, as well as Justices Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Neil Gorsuch. Concurring and dissenting opinions Justice Thomas also wrote a concurring opinion, joined by Gorsuch. The decision is expected to allow any entity with a pending case before an SEC ALJ to request a new ruling, but the ruling was crafted as to prevent completed cases from being reopened; it is unknown if this case would apply to cases open at other agencies besides the SEC. Justice Stephen Breyer concurred in part with the judgment and dissented in part, with Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor joining in his dissent, which agreed that the appointment of ALJs by SEC staff, rather than the commissioners themselves, was illegal. That was because of a violation of the Administrative Procedure ActLucia, 585 U.S. at ___ (Breyer, J., dissenting)(slip op. at 2). and so it was unnecessary to address the constitutional question.Lucia, 585 U.S. at ___ (Breyer, J., dissenting)(slip op. at 3). In addition, Breyer argued that it was problematic to determine the \\"inferior Officer\\" status of ALJs without first deciding the \\"pre-existing Free Enterprise Fund. question— namely, what effect that holding would have on the statutory 'for cause' removal protections that Congress provided for administrative law judges.\\"Lucia, 585 U.S. at ___ (Breyer, J., dissenting)(slip op. at 12). Finally, Breyer disagreed with the need for a hearing before a different ALJ, as it is not clear that the Constitution requires a hearing before a different \\"Officer\\" after an Appointments Clause violation.Lucia, 585 U.S. at ___ (Breyer, J., dissenting)(slip op. at 14). Sotomayor also wrote a dissenting opinion, joined by Ginsburg, which stated that ALJs should not be treated as officers as their judgments are not treated as final and binding.

She was known for her work on worms, specializing in polychaetes. She was the world authority on polynoidae during her career.  Life and career  Pettibone studied at Linfield College and received her BS in 1930. In 1932 she received her MS from the University of Oregon, and in 1947 her PhD from the University of Washington. Pettibone began in 1930 as a research and laboratory assistant at the University of Oregon until 1933. She then became a biology instructor at St. Helen's Hall Junior College in Portland, Oregon, from 1935 to 1942, and at the University of Washington, Seattle in 1945 to 1949. In 1949 she moved to Washington, D.C. and became a research associate at the Johns Hopkins University and the Office of Naval Research. Then in 1953 she became an Associate Professor of zoology at the University of New Hampshire until she moved back to Washington, D.C. in 1963 to work at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History as the Curator of Polychaetes. Pettibone retired in 1978 because of the federal age mandatory retirement rules, but was still active in her field as a Curator Emerita until a few years before her death. She has 33 species and 3 genera named after her.  World War II  During WW2 Pettibone worked in a shipyard for the war effort. As she was in line for her interview she overheard that the men that were in the other line to sign up for welding jobs were going to be paid much more than the women applying for secretarial work. She switched lines and became a welder. She was a quality control manager in her welding section before the war ended.  Publications  While at the University of New Hampshire Pettibone wrote part 1 of her work called \\"Marine Polychaete Worms of the New England Region\\", which was published in 1963. It was so popular it was re-printed twenty years later, in 1983. During her career she published 84 papers, most of which were single- authored. She authored 77 genera and 172 species. 73 genera and 147 species remain valid today.

Ilfrey was known as Happy Jack for his cheerful disposition, and his ground crews in England nicknamed each of his planes \\"Happy Jack's Go Buggy\\". Youth Jack Milton Ilfrey was born on July 31, 1920, in Houston, Texas. He attended Mirabeau Lamar Senior High School and the University of Houston, before completing a civilian pilot training program in 1939 at Texas A&M; University. He joined the United States Army Air Corps in April 1941 as an aviation cadet, and graduated on December 12, 1941 in Class 41-I at Luke Field, Arizona, being commissioned as a second lieutenant. Entry into the war and combat in North Africa Ilfrey was first assigned to the 94th Fighter Squadron, 1st Fighter Group, equipped with the Lockheed P-38 Lightning. His unit moved from California to Maine in early 1942 in preparation for Operation Bolero, the United States Army Air Forces' movement to England. The 1st Fighter Group was then transferred to North Africa after Operation Torch in November 1942. On November 15, 1942, he was on a ferry flight from England to North Africa when one of the drop tanks on his P-38 malfunctioned and he ran low on fuel. He landed at an airfield in Portugal, and was informed, as Portugal was a neutral country, that he would be interned for the duration of the war. Ilfrey managed to convince the Portuguese to refuel his plane, and when a major asked to inspect it, Ilfrey agreed. Ilfrey was seated in the cockpit showing him the controls when he suddenly pushed the throttles forward, knocking the major off the wing and roaring down the runway. Ilfrey landed in Gibraltar, and then flew to North Africa. He was berated by his commanding officer for nearly causing an international incident, but the commander of the Twelfth Air Force General Jimmy Doolittle, stepped in on his behalf. He flew P-38F-1-LO, serial number 41-7587, nicknamed \\"Texas Terror\\" (left tail boom)/\\"The Mad Dash\\" (right tail boom). He scored five and a half aerial victories and damaged two enemy aircraft, becoming what many believe to be one of the first, if not the first, pilot to reach \\"ace\\" status while flying a P-38. During 1943, he was sent back to the United States to become a P-38 instructor in California. He completed 72 combat missions and 208 flying hours with the 1st Fighter Group. He was promoted to captain on April 5, 1943. War in Europe 20th Fighter Group P-38 Lightnings in June 1944 In the spring of 1944, he was posted as squadron commander of the 79th Fighter Squadron of the 20th Fighter Group, the famous \\"Loco Busters\\", where Ilfrey was known for his fearlessness. He flew a P-38J-15-LO, serial number 43-28431, nicknamed \\"Happy Jack's Go Buggy.\\" On May 24, 1944, he scored two more confirmed aerial victories on a mission over Berlin, Germany; one of them by ramming. A Messerschmitt Bf 109 collided with the right wing of Ilfrey's P-38 during aerial combat maneuvers, tearing off four to five feet of the wing tip; the German plane crashed, but Ilfrey managed to return to base in England. On June 13, 1944, after attacking the La Possonniere (Maine-et-Loire) railway bridge, he saw a locomotive at the Lion-d'Angers station. While attacking this objective, his aircraft was hit by anti-aircraft artillery fire. One of his engines caught fire and he parachuted, landing heavily on a farm building, his parachute having opened too low. Ilfrey was deep behind enemy lines. He was taken in by a friendly French family, who gave him shelter, food, a bicycle, and false identity papers as a deaf-mute farmer named \\"Jacques Robert.\\" He eventually reached the Allied front line, and on June 20, 1944, he was back in England. After his escape, instead of being returned to the United States as most other evaders were (to prevent the enemy from extracting valuable information about resistance networks from them if they were captured again), Ilfrey returned to the 79th Fighter Squadron which was converting to P-51 Mustangs. He flew P-51D-5-NA 44-13761, obligatorily nicknamed \\"Happy Jack's Go Buggy.\\" In early December 1944, his tour ended and he returned to the United States. He completed 70 combat missions and 320 flying hours with the 20th Fighter Group. Ilfrey spent the rest of the war in a staff position on the Pacific coast. He was discharged on December 28, 1945, with the rank of major. His final tally was seven and a half confirmed aerial victories, with two enemy aircraft damaged.

Bronner, \\"frenetically jump and gyrate on stage in Amish garb.\\" Band member Ezekiel has stated that they use the clothing as a gimmick, but not in a disrespectful manner. Growing up, the band members did not have much exposure to music outside the Amish community. They sang to Ausbund and heard bits and pieces of music from cars passing through their community.

The name of the song refers to a phrase tattooed on the back of Yue Fei, and a mantra with which he is commonly identified. The lyrics of the song allude to the Jin–Song Wars, in which Yue Fei played a pivotal role. Basis The title Loyalty to the Country refers to a popular semi-historical legend surrounding Yue Fei. According to these accounts, Yue Fei had the Chinese characters jin zhong bao guo (simplified Chinese: 尽忠报国; traditional Chinese: 盡忠報國; pinyin: jìn zhōng bào guó; literally: \\"serve the country with the utmost loyalty\\") tattooed across his back by his mother to ensure his dedication to the state. According to The Story of King Yue Who Restored the Song dynasty (《大宋中興岳王傳》), one of the earliest Ming era works chronicling the general, Yue Fei would show the tattoo to soldiers when he detected that they wished to desert, and he implored a number of his men to have the characters tattooed on their backs. The legend has undergone a number of fictionalisations across its centuries long history, and remains a popular element of Chinese folklore today.

It was produced by Jimmy Balderston and Nic White with assistance from Darren Cordeux. Background and promotion The coordinates on the album cover, 42ºS 147ºE, are the coordinates for the state of Tasmania. Their first single from the album, \\"Got to Give\\", was released on 16 June 2017 with an accompanying music video for it following a month later. The band released the second single \\"Let it Slip\\" on 13 April 2018, with its corresponding music video releasing a month later. On 1 June, the band released their third single \\"Clothes I Slept In\\". Shortly after the release of their single \\"Got to Give\\", they performed a national headline tour. The band performed a six-date national tour to promote album in August 2018. The band announced another national tour for 2019, this time for their single \\"The Clothes I Slept In\\". The tour is set to be the band's longest, spanning two months and twenty-one dates performing in regional hubs of all states. Critical reception Stay received positive reviews. Wall of Sound in a 6/10 review said: \\"If you love the Australian indie rock sounds favoured by Triple J at the moment, this album is for you. It’s emotive, uncomplicated and consistent. If you like your rock heavier, then maybe give it a miss.\\" Rating the album 8.5/10, Alexander Crowden of Beat said: \\"With Stay, Luca Brasi emerge as one of the country’s best rock bands, period.\\" Hysteria rated the album 7/10 and praised vocalist Tyler Richardson saying: \\"As a vocalist, Richardson is at the top of his game on Stay. He carries the same raw bite and thick Tassie accent as is signature to Luca Brasi, but LP4 presents him biting with more passion than punkiness.\\" Jonty Cornford of KillYourStereo scored the album 65/100 stating: \\"Given their track record, this isn’t so much a dip in quality as it is a gentle leaning back on the work that they’ve done to get where they are today.\\" Track listing Track listing adapted from AllMusic.

Angelo (Daniel Padilla) now works as a baker in the humble bakery owned by Lolo Greggy (Tirso Cruz III) — the man who saved Angelo during an accident. Meanwhile, Lia (Andrea Brillantes) fails to accept the events which causes her to become rude and snobbish. After two years in jail, Eduardo (Ian Veneracion) is finally released and decides to rekindle his love with Amor (Jodi Sta. Maria), much to the detriment of Lia. Amor decides to let Eduardo court her which results in him proposing to her.

As Newfoundland was being administered by the Commission of Government, and had no functioning parliament, the British declaration of war on Germany automatically brought Newfoundland into a state of war with Germany on 3 September 1939. Raising of the Newfoundland Militia The period between the two World Wars saw great political turmoil in the Dominion of Newfoundland, resulting in the suspension of responsible government and the appointing of the Commission of Government resulting the Newfoundland reverting to the status of a Crown colony. The presence of the German Navy in Atlantic waters threatened the security of the colony, and in September 1939 it was decided to raise a local defence militia unit for the defence of the island. The Newfoundland Militia was tasked with guarding strategic positions on the island, including the dry docks, water supply, and oil reserves in St. John's and the Newfoundland Broadcasting Company's radio station in Mount Pearl. Later, these guard duties were expanded to include the maintenance of a coastal defence battery on Bell Island to protect the Wabana Iron Ore Mines, and mines and docks throughout the rest of the island. Following the Fall of France in 1940, Newfoundland's defensive position was seen as being more precarious. This led to Canada assuming responsibility for the defence of Newfoundland with the establishment of 'W Force': various infantry, artillery, and anti-aircraft garrison forces to be stationed on the island. The Newfoundland Militia was immediately placed under command of W Force and, eventually, under command of a Canadian commanding officer. In addition to its infantry defence duties Newfoundland also maintained the 1st Coastal Defence Battery, a coastal defence battery on Bell Island to protect the approaches to the island where bulk carriers loaded iron ore from the Bell Island Mines. On the night of September 4, 1942 U-153 entered Conception Bay and sunk the SS Saganaga and SS Lord Strathcona. Responding to naval ships firing their guns at a target in the water, 1st Coastal Defence Battery manned their guns and attempted to fire on the same location; however, the U-Boat escaped. This was the only occasion that 1st Coastal Defence Battery fired its guns in anger. Newfoundland Regiment The efforts of the Canadian Army to expand and train the militia to professional standards resulted in the Newfoundland Militia being re-designated the Newfoundland Regiment on March 2, 1943. The regiment stayed in a home-defence role, but in addition to these duties was also tasked with training excess recruits for the two regiments of the Royal Artillery that were recruited in Newfoundland for overseas service. By the end of the Second World War, 1,668 Newfoundlanders had enlisted for service in the Newfoundland Regiment. 17 members of the militia were killed on December 12, 1942 during the Knights of Columbus Hostel fire in St. John's.  Royal Artillery Service  Beginning in 1940, Newfoundland began recruiting citizens for service in two Royal Artillery units: the 57th (Newfoundland) Heavy Artillery Regiment and the 59th (Newfoundland) Heavy Artillery Regiment, though during the war, the 57th transitioned into a field artillery regiment and was redesignated the 166th (Newfoundland) Field Artillery Regiment. Both artillery units were initially assigned to coastal defence duties in Britain, resulting in a backlog of recruits in Newfoundland who could not be immediately posted to either artillery unit. To make use of these excess recruits, the Department of Militia decided in 1942 to utilize the artillery regiments as a training and recruit depot for artillery recruits. These individuals enlisted into the artillery regiments, and were deployed overseas as they were needed. By the end of the war, 820 of the 1,668 members had deployed overseas with the Royal Artillery (representing roughly 20% of Newfoundland's artillery commitments), while a further 447 trained gunners were in Newfoundland awaiting transport to Europe on VE Day. Counting the men still in Newfoundland, 1,267 Newfoundland soldiers were assigned to the Royal Artillery during the Second World War.  166th (Newfoundland) Field Artillery Regiment  A British 25 pdr Gun, which the 166th (Newfoundland) Field Artillery Regiment used. The 166th Regiment was first deployed to North Africa as part of the British First Army in the closing months of the North African Campaign. The regiment served in Tunisia until the end of the campaign, suffering 24 members killed in action. In Tunisia the 166th supported soldiers of the French XIX Corps, specifically the Goumiers. The regiment remained in North Africa during the invasion of Sicily, not deploying to the island until the end of the campaign. The Newfoundlanders deployed to Italy in October 1943 with the British Eighth Army, where it remained until the end of hostilities in 1945. The Regiment rotated between various divisions within the Eighth Army, including the 8th Indian Division and the 2nd New Zealand Division; the New Zealanders were under the command of Bernard Freyberg who had commanded the 88th Brigade in which the Royal Newfoundland Regiment served during the First World War. During the campaign, the 166th participated in major actions such as the Battle of Monte Cassino, and numerous soldiers of the regiment received decorations for bravery. One such individual was Captain Gordon Campbell (Cam) Eaton, who was awarded the Military Cross in 1943 while serving as a forward observation officer. Eaton went on to serve in the Canadian Forces following 1949 with the reformed 166th Regiment, R.C.A., and was appointed Honorary Colonel of the Royal Newfoundland Regiment and later received the Order of Canada.  59th (Newfoundland) Heavy Artillery Regiment  BL 9.2 inch Mk II howitzers of 57th (Newfoundland) Heavy Regiment, Royal Artillery As a heavy artillery regiment, the 59th remained in England on coastal defence duties until 1944. In July, following the Normandy Landings, the 59th crossed the English Channel and on July 6 disembarked at Courseulles-sur-Mer where the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division had landed a month before. Once in France, the 59th served as part of the Army Group Royal Artillery of the British 21st Army Group. The unit first went into action supporting Battle of Caen, and later bombarded German forces in the Falaise Pocket. From here, the 59th participated in the major battles of North-West Europe, including supporting the advance of XXX Corps during Operation Market Garden and in support of American forces during the Battle of the Bulge. The 59th ended the war in Germany, firing its last shots against Hamburg on May 2, 1945. During the North-West Europe campaign, the main guns of the 59th were the 7.2\\" Howitzer and the American-made 155mm 'Long Tom'.

Originally built in 1856 as the Texas Asylum for the Blind, the complex was used for a variety of purposes through the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. It was acquired by the University of Texas after World War I and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. History On August 16, 1856, the Texas Legislature enacted a measure providing for the establishment of a Texas Asylum for the Blind (now known as the Texas School for the Blind and Visually Impaired) in Austin. The state leased the Neill–Cochran House as a temporary site for the asylum while a permanent building was constructed. The asylum facility was built between 1856 and 1857 at a cost of $12,390 (). In 1857 the asylum moved into its building, where it operated until the end of the American Civil War in 1865, at which point the campus was commandeered by General George Armstrong Custer, who used the facility as his family's residence while contributing to the occupation and Reconstruction of Texas. In 1866 the asylum was restored, and it occupied the campus from then until 1915, while the program was renamed the Texas Blind Institute in 1905 and then the Texas School for the Blind in 1915. During this period the complex was expanded with the construction of several additional buildings. During World War I the School for the Blind was displaced by a military pilot training program, and a barracks was added to the complex. After the war the School for the Blind relocated to a new and larger campus, and the original asylum facility spent several years housing the Texas State Hospital for the Senile. Little Campus In the mid 1920s the growing University of Texas at Austin purchased the campus from the State Hospital system, after which it came to be known as the \\"Little Campus\\" (by contrast with the main campus to the northwest). The university built a women's dormitory called the Little Residence Hall and renovated the existing buildings into a men's dormitory. The facility was again commandeered for military training during World War II, reverting to the university's use after the war's end. On August 13, 1974, the Little Campus was declared a United States historic district and added to the National Register of Historic Places. In 1987 the area was officially renamed the \\"Heman Sweatt Campus,\\" in honor of former UT law student and African-American civil rights plaintiff Heman Marion Sweatt. Today, many of the Little Campus's historic structures have been demolished to make room for redevelopment, but two buildings remain: the asylum's original building, now known as the Arno Nowotny Building, holds the office of the director of the university's Dolph Briscoe Center for American History, and John W. Hargis Hall houses the university's Undergraduate Admissions Center. Architecture Hargis Hall, one of two historic buildings remaining in the Little Campus The original 1857 asylum building (now the Nowotny Building) is a two-story Italianate structure of rough limestone with red brick detailing. The main facade features five sets of paired windows with limestone sills framed in brick and topped with brick segmental arches. The corners are reinforced with brick quoins, and a wide first-story portico extends to both sides of the main entry. A brick cornice marks the roofline, above which the gray metal roof is punctuated by an octagonal Italianate dome. The building was designed and built by Abner H. Cook, an Austin architect who had recently designed the Texas Governor's Mansion. The other surviving building, Hargis Hall, is a two-story Victorian Italianate structure of tan bricks with limestone detailing formed by the joining of two older buildings, one built in 1889 and one in 1900. The many windows have limestone sills and are topped by limestone segmental arches with distinct keystones. A dark red cornice supports the gray metal roof, from which there rises a square clock tower on one side and a shorter square tower on the other.

The Iron Man is a 1930 animated film which was directed by John Foster and Harry Bailey. It was produced by The Van Beuren Corporation, and released by Pathé, a film distributor which had the newsreel Pathé News. The film was also part of the early sound cartoon series entitled Aesop's Sound Fables. However, although the film is part of that-said series, the film is actually not based on a fable written by Aesop. Another abnormality with this film is that although it was released in 1930, the copyright notice on the actual film reads in roman numerals MCMXXIX, which translates to 1929.  Plot  thumbupright 1.17 The Iron Man in outer space. The film begins with a male cat walking down the street singing and playing a musicbox. He then descends onto a neighborhood. He plays there until Farmer Al Falfa, a recurring character in the Aesop series, looks out of his window, and describes the music as \\"rotten\\". He then gets out of his house, and asks the cat to leave. He compiles, by running off the screen. The farmer, then chases a pair of chickens, who were there when the cat first descended onto the neighborhood. They then fly up onto a branch of a tree. Once up there, one chicken lays an egg and flings it at the farmer. The farmer, for retaliation, acquires a saw, and climbs up the tree, nearly falling off it whilst climbing. Once at the same level as the chickens, he brings out his saw and begins to cut. As soon as they realise that the farmer is cutting off an individual branch, which would make the farmer fall off the tree. The chickens retreat to the trunk of the tree. However, the tree branch comically stays standing, whilst the rest of the tree collapses. The farmer then descends from the branch to the ground. However, the branch hits him and the animals, who were watching the ordeal, starts to laugh at him. The farmer then returns home. Once he is back home and sitting on the stair leading to his front door, the postal service arrives with a package which is delivered via a horse drawn carriage. That package is an machine, an iron man. Once the farmer opens up the package. The robot starts to dance, with the farmer following along. During the dance, the robot kicks the farmer. So, in retaliation, the farmer kicks the robot back. This causes the robot to malfunction, by gradually increasing in size, until it is bigger than the Earth. The robot then explodes. The farmer then laughs at the animals. Until, the debris comically falls from space and reassembles the robot. Both the farmer and the animals run from the robot in the closing shot of the cartoon. The film ends with a moral, which is portrayed with a duck and a sleeping Milton Mouse, the only time he is featured in this cartoon. The duck states that, \\"An oyster is a fish dressed up like a nut\\". The duck's statement wakes up the sleeping mouse. The duck then tugs at the mouse's fishing pole, mistaking Milton that he has caught a fish. Milton proceeds to pull at the pole, which results in him falling off the duck and into the water. The film ends with the duck laughing.  Characters  This cartoon, unlike other Aesop Sound Fables at that time, does not features Rita Mouse and features Milton Mouse only once. Milton is featured in the moral which is at the end of the cartoon. Instead, another recurring character entitled Farmer Al Falfa is featured in this cartoon, portrayed as the main character, he unexpectedly receives the iron man via post. Other characters in the film are a variety of species of animals, and the iron-man, who chases after all the characters at the end of the cartoon.  Reception  The film gathered positive reviews from the film magazines at that time.Motion Picture Hearld, September 19, 1931 The Motion Picture News said that the film has \\"nearly everything needed in a short of pen-and-ink variety\\", and also said the film's music created \\"many laughs when tied up to the antics to the cartoon characters\\". The magazine's closing comment is that \\"A good slapstick, or a short dramatic number will go along well with this.\\"  References   External Links  * * Category:1930 films Category:1930s American animated films Category:1930 animated films Category:American films Category:American black-and-white films ","title":"The Iron Man (1930 film)"},{"id":"57735828","text":"Mořic Hruban The Catholic-National Conservative Party in Moravia (), was a Czech catholic political party in Moravia.

She was an early employee of the Hispanic Society of America in New York City, with a specialty in sculpture. Her expertise expanded to American sculpture with her work at Brookgreen Gardens in South Carolina, and she died an honorary trustee. Her work also included advising the magazine of the National Sculpture Society. She was the author of preeminent studies on Spanish sculpture and American sculpture. Personal life Gilman was born in Thornton, New Hampshire, on October 31, 1899, on a farm to parents Alice May (Hazeltine) Gilman and Jeremiah Gilman. She had one older brother. Her early education was in a one- room schoolhouse. She attended Simmons College in Boston, receiving her B.S. in library science in 1920. From 1922 through 1923 Gilman attended the School of American Sculpture. In 1935 she married Herbert Proske, who was born and raised in Germany. She loved puns and wordplay, including composing some of her own poems, such as \\"Pride\\", inscribed on a plaque at Brookgreen Gardens. In her later life, she lived in Ardsley, New York with her cat, \\"Pretty Boy.\\" Proske died on February 2, 2002, in Ardsley, New York, at the age of 102.  Career   Hispanic Society of America  In 1920, she was hired after an interview with Elizabeth du Gué Trapier as an art book cataloger at the library of the Hispanic Society, without any art experience. In 1922, Archer Milton Huntington, founder of the Society, selected six women, of which she was one, to focus deeply on topics within the Society's collection. He asked if she would focus on sculpture, to which she agreed. He encouraged her growth through annual trips to Spain, as well as lessons in Spanish and sculpture. She went on to catalog the collection of sculpture of the Hispanic Society. She developed close friendships with Trapier and Alice Wilson Frothingham, two other women hired by Huntington to curate art and ceramics, respectively. They traveled to Europe together. As they began publishing, they styled their writings after Ernest Hemingway. She was curator of the museum from 1968 through 1969. Proske held numerous positions at the Hispanic Society, including Chief of Prints and Photographs, Assistant Curator of Sculpture, Research Curator of Sculpture, and then Curator of the Museum. She worked at the Hispanic Society for 52 years, from 1925 through 1973. She was appointed Curator Emerita of Sculpture in 1973, after her retirement from the position in 1972.  Brookgreen Gardens  Later, after the founding of Brookgreen Gardens, she was encouraged to expand into American sculpture by Huntington. She cataloged the collection of American sculpture of the 19th and 20th centuries of the collection of Brookgreen Gardens, the first garden of American sculpture open to the public. Proske authored a key source of study for American figurative sculpture from the 19th and 20th century works at Brookgreen Gardens. Specifically, Proske held expertise in the work of Anna Hyatt Huntington, a co-founder of Brookgreen Gardens. Proske was a board member from 1937 to 1945. During her tenure and beyond, she was the editor and curator of the Garden's publications.

He was associated for many years with the Shawinigan Water and Power Company, of which he was president from 1933 to 1939, and with the Montreal Tramways Company. He is considered the architect of the hydroelectric development of the Saint-Maurice River in central Quebec.  Biography  Born in Elmira, New York, in the southwest of the State of New York, in October 1878, he moved with his family to Buffalo, where he attended elementary and high school together with his twin brother Joslyn. He enrolled at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. Although his twin brother died in January 1897, Smith continued his studies and received his degree in mechanical engineering, with electrical option in 1900. The 1900 Cornell yearbook describes him as a discreet and studious young man who had military ambitions before he chose to put his energies into his electrical engineering program. After he graduated, he worked as an industrial designer for a manufacturing company and for the Pan-American Exposition which took place in Buffalo in 1901. He later joined the engineering firm of Wallace C. Johnson, in Niagara Falls, as a draftsman. In September 1902, Johnson and Smith arrived in Shawinigan Falls to help with the construction of the hydroelectric facilities of the Shawinigan Water and Power Company. The company offered Smith a job as superintendent and he moved to Montreal. Smith rose through the ranks and became general superintendent in 1906, chief engineer in 1909, vice president in 1915 and vice president and general manager the next year. He succeeded J. E. Aldred as president of SWP in 1933. Smith had been associated with the SWP's major hydroelectric developments for the company's first 40 years - Shawinigan-2, Grand-Mère, La Gabelle, Rapide-Blanc and La Tuque generating stations – as well as management of the Saint-Maurtice River which gained him the title of \\"Architect of the Saint-Maurice\\". He was also involved with the design and construction of the des Cèdres power station in the Soulanges sector of the Saint Larence River together with Montreal Light, Heat and Power between 1913 and 1915. Smith's work provided SWP with a reputation for excellence and innovation in engineering. Under his leadership, the company developed expertise in managing power generation from rivers, doubling the productivity of Quebec's rivers. As well, the electric boilers developed by SWO's engineers allowed the company to make use of its surplus of electricity during the Great Depression of the 1930s. In 1919, SWP established a consulting engineering firm, Shawinigan Engineering. Smith sat on the boards of directors of several companies, including Quebec Power, Canadian Light & Power, Montreal Light, Heat and Power, Dominion Bridge Company Limited, Saguenay Power Company and The Royal Bank of Canada. He was president of the Montreal Tramways Company, a precursor of the Société de transport de Montréal, from 1924 to 1939. In 1928, he was president of the Engineering Institute of Canada, and he was named as a governor (member of the board of directors) of McGill University in 1931. He was a member of several professional associations, including the Institution of Civil Engineers in the United Kingdom. He died at his home on Sydenham Avenue in Westmount on June 24, 1939, after a long illness. He was 60 years old.

The Department termed it an \\"emergency influx care facility\\" and named it the Tornillo Influx Facility. When it was built in June 2018, the capacity was 400 minor immigrants with a one month contract. It was later expanded to a capacity of 4,000 minors. As many as 2,800 teenagers were held at the site before its closure was announced in January 2019. This made it one of the largest facilities in ORR's Unaccompanied Alien Children Program. All immigrant children had left the facility by January 11, 2019. Nearly 6,200 minors cycled through the facility within the seven months it operated. The area was previously used for a few months in 2016 to process migrant families and unaccompanied minors.  About  Bunk beds inside the tents The tent city in Tornillo, Texas was created in order to \\"house the overflow of immigrant children, many of whom have been separated from their parents,\\" according to NBC News. It was run by the Administration for Children and Families which is a division of the United States Department of Health and Human Services. The tent city was meant to be a temporary shelter and was the first one constructed to house children who have been separated from their families under Trump's \\"zero tolerance policy\\" for families entering the United States illegally. United States Representative, Will Hurd, said that \\"he was told that only teenage boys were at the facility -- and that they were children who had entered the country by themselves.\\" However, U.S. Representative Beto O'Rourke said that children who were separated from their families were also housed in the tent city. It is unclear whether the minors housed in the tent city were separated from their families or had been apprehended without adults present. The shelter was located near the Tornillo Land Port of Entry on the border of Texas and Mexico. It was designed to start taking in 360 children, with further plans for expansion. The entire facility was built within 24 hours of the federal government confirming the location of the shelter. The location was confirmed on June 14, 2018 and by the next day, 100 children were already located on site. The shelter had the capacity for 4,000 children. The shelter apparently doubled in size from June 18 to June 19, according to aerial photographs taken by Reuters. Tents housing the children were air- conditioned, according to a spokesperson from DHS. The tents could hold up to 20 children and 2 adults at a time. The tents had bunk beds. There was no shade in the area surrounding the tents. The tent city facility also had showers, toilets, medical facilities, meeting spaces and fire trucks. It was fenced in with chain link fencing topped with barbed wire. There is one adult for every ten children and minors receive three meals a day and snacks. It has been estimated by DHS that it costs $775 per migrant child per night to house them inside the tent city. On June 21, 2018, mayors from the U.S. Conference of Mayors and politicians from across the United States were denied entry to the tent city. Hurd was able to tour the facility on June 15.  Operations  Operations were contracted to BCFS Health and Human Services, a San Antonio faith-based nonprofit. Costs were estimated to be between $750-$1,200 for each minor per night. As of November 2018, the 2,100 staffers had not passed FBI fingerprint background checks, a requirement waived by Scott Lloyd, now former director of HHS’s Office of Refugee Resettlement. BCFS has operated facilities for unaccompanied migrant minors in multiple states since the Obama administration.  Criticism  Texas State Senator José Rodríguez called housing children in the shelters \\"totally inhumane and it is outrageous.\\" The area was currently experiencing 100 to 105 degrees Fahrenheit weather. Texas State Representative César Blanco said that housing immigrant children in tents was \\"dehumanizing and tarnishes Texas' tradition of welcoming immigrants.\\" United States Representative Beto O'Rourke led hundreds on a protest march to the site of the tent city on June 17, 2018. US Representatives Rosa DeLauro (of Connecticut) and Lucille Roybal-Allard (California) called for the closure of the camp in a December 3, 2018 letter to HHS Secretary Alex Azar. In the letter, they stated, \\"The administration is using this facility, which is on federal land and unregulated by State child welfare authorities, to evade requirements and standards for the care of children.\\"Rosa De Lauro and Lucille Roybal-Allard, Letter to Alex Azar, December 3, 2018.  Closure  According to Kevin Dinnin, president of BCFS, the camp closure initiated after the contractor refused to continue expanding operations. The day after the refusal, Department of Health and Human Services announced that the strict background requirement for sponsor households would be reversed, expediting the rate of sponsorship placements. It was announced that all detained children had been sponsored or transferred to other shelters on January 11, 2019.

It was an unofficial offering of the 16th Venice Biennale of Architecture and ran from 24 May to 1 July, 2018. Between 22 February and 7 April 2019, the second edition opened at Ludlow 38 in New York City. In late 2019, the final chapter of the project opened at ArkDes, the Swedish Centre for Architecture and Design, in Stockholm and ran from 20 September to 10 November, 2019.  Exhibition  The Cruising Pavilion darkroom at ArkDes, Stockholm The Cruising Pavilion at ArkDes, Stockholm looking at the bedroom The exhibit in Venice sought to depict places where gay men historically looked for casual sex and hookups, including \\"non- conventional venues such as parking lots, parks, bathroom stalls, and dark rooms.\\" The design of the exhibition included glory holes, a semblance of dark rooms, and aspects seeking to demonstrate aspects of hooking-up including narrow stairs and multiple levels. The show presented ways LGBT people \\"have shaped space and the ways in which architecture has therefore in turn shaped space for them.\\" Cruising as a practice and the spaces in which it happens were explored and made safe in the exhibition, all while challenging the heteronormativity commonly expressed in the Venice Biennale of Architecture itself. This is especially dramatic given the implications of online and dating apps such as Grindr. The exhibition in New York explored the different directions by which cruising practices have evolved. The exhibition in Stockholm, which took place in a national gallery, explored the intersection of cruising and architectural environments. According to critic Michael Bullock, \\"in a little less than two years, [Cruising Pavilion] has gone from a renegade operation to an institutionalized project shown in a national museum, though ironically it found its most distinguished venue in a city of 2.4 million people with only one official gay bar.\\"  Artists  The Cruising Pavilion at ArkDes, Stockholm *Cruising Pavilion in Venice, was curated by Pierre-Alexandre Mateos, Rasmus Myrup, Octave Perrault and Charles Teyssou.

The novel is set in a small town in Cévennes and concerns two pairs of mixed gender dysfunctional adult siblings, one French and one English who become entangled in a dispute over property. Plot Audrun is an elderly woman who lives in a small shack she has inherited in a small town in Cévennes where she has always lived. Her older brother terrorized her when they were children and as an adult lives a lonely life in their childhood home, which he has partially ruined through hoarding. When he asks Audrun to come help him clean out the house she discovers that he has plans to sell it for roughly half a million euros. Anthony Verey is an elderly antiques dealer who is quickly becoming insolvent. Realizing his life is stagnating he calls his sister, Veronica, who is living in Cévennes with her lover, Kitty, while they collaborate on a book. To Kitty's distress, Veronica offers to let Anthony stay with them indefinitely until he feels better. Anthony forms the idea of buying a home near Veronica and permanently resettling. Aramon, Audrun's brother, continues to make her life hell, telling her that the small shack she built near their childhood home is an eyesore and if any of it crosses onto his property line he will tear it down. Because the shack was hastily built Audrun is unsure of its legality. She begins to contemplate murdering her brother. Anthony visits Aramon's house, the Mas Lunel, which he falls in love with but refuses to buy after seeing Audrun's shack. He goes to visit another property and never returns. Veronica launches an extensive search for him and as she does her relationship with Kitty, who hated Anthony, falls apart. In the meantime Aramon has been getting increasingly ill, experiencing blackouts which he had much earlier in his life as a teenager when he and his father began raping Audrun after Bernadette, Audrun and Aramon's mother died. Audrun suggests to Aramon that Anthony was there the day he disappeared but as Aramon was experiencing a prolonged blackout he cannot remember if this is true or not. Audrun continues to feed Aramon's paranoia and, after he finds Anthony's car in his garage, he withdraws the house for sale and bars all visitors. When a family friend asks if her daughter can bring some schoolchildren on their property for a picnic Aramon refuses, but Audrun permits them to lunch on her side of the property. One of the children then discovers Anthony's body in a pool of water. When the police come to investigate Audrun deliberately lets slip that she saw Anthony and Aramon together a second time. In actuality, after an unsatisfactory viewing of another country home, Anthony had decided to buy Mas Lunel and Audrun, wanting to block the sale, persuaded him to accompany her to the river where she murdered him, planted the body in a small pool, and then hid his car in Aramon's garage. Aramon is arrested but Audrun's victory is short lived. After a dry summer season forest fires break out in the region and one of them destroys the Mas Lunel. Audrun decides to raze Mas Lunel and let nature take over the land. In prison Aramon is treated for ulcers, makes a few friends, and finally approaches something close to happiness for the first time in years. One day Audrun decides to visit him, bringing him a branch of white cherry blossom which they both remember as a positive memory from when they were children. Aramon finally apologizes to Audrun for his abuse.

The effluent flowed into the Balog River down to Agno River and San Roque Dam. At least four more major discharges were reported: on August 4, 11, and 30, and September 13.

Originally it was part of the Chao Phraya River. In the past, the course of the Chao Phraya was longer than in the present. Those who travel by boat must cruise along the river, which took more than one day, until the reign of King Chairachathirat (1534–46) of the Ayutthaya Kingdom who ordered the construction of a canal bypassing a loop of the Chao Phraya River, known as Khlong Lat Bangkok (คลองลัดบางกอก; Bangkok Short-Cut Canal), thus reducing travel times and changing the course of the Chao Phraya, which now flows along the new canal. The old course became what is known today as Khlong Bangkok Yai (lower section) and Khlong Bangkok Noi (upper section). Mouth of Khlong Bangkok Yai where it connects to the Chao Phraya River flanked by Wichai Prasit Fort and Wat Kalayanamitr In the reign of King Taksin (1767–82) of Thonburi Kingdom, he founded a new capital on the west side of the Chao Phraya River. So, the banks of Khlong Bangkok Yai became the residence of many people, including much of the nobility, giving rise to the names Khlong Bang Luang or Khlong Bang Kha Luang (คลองบางหลวง, คลองบางข้าหลวง; Canal of Nobles). Khlong Bangkok Yai was also the first canal in Thailand to have lampposts installed. The current length is 6 km (about 3 mi), passing through Bangkok Yai, Phasi Charoen and Thon Buri Districts. Khlong Bangkok Yai is now a waterway and drainage. It is also a major site of cultural tourism of Bangkok. There are many houses of worship on both sides, such as Wat Molilokayaram, Wat Hongratanaram, Wat Nuannoradit, Wat Kalayanamitr, Wat Paknam Bhasicharoen, Wat Kuhasawan, Bang Luang Mosque, Tonson Mosque, and Kudi Charoenphat, and also historic places such as Khlong Bang Luang Artist House, Talat Phlu or Wichai Prasit Fort.

It was written by series creator Michael Schur and directed by executive producer Drew Goddard. It aired on NBC in the United States on September 19, 2016, airing back-to-back with the second episode \\"Flying\\". The series focuses on Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell), a woman who wakes up in the afterlife and is introduced by Michael (Ted Danson) to \\"The Good Place\\", a Heaven-like utopia he designed, in reward for her righteous life. She realizes that she was sent there by mistake and must hide her morally imperfect behavior and try to become a better person. The episode earned a Nielsen rating of 2.3/8 in the 18–49 demographic and was viewed by 8.04 million viewers. It earned positive reviews from critics, praising the writing and Bell's and Danson's performances. Plot Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell) finds herself in a waiting room, with the words \\"Welcome! Everything Is Fine.\\" written on the wall. She then enters a room where a man named Michael (Ted Danson) awaits her. He informs her that she is dead, killed after a line of shopping carts in the parking lot of a supermarket pushed her into the oncoming path of a truck which was advertising erectile dysfunction pills, and the space they are in is a Heaven-like utopia called \\"The Good Place.\\" Michael gives her a tour throughout the Good Place before getting her to meet with newcomers and watch an informational video. In the video, Michael explains that every action humans make in their life gives them either positive or negative points depending of their choices. After a person dies, their total points are tallied and only people with very high points are allowed into The Good Place. Eleanor earned her spot for saving lives as a lawyer that defended people on death row. Also, every person in the Good Place has a soulmate, a person with whom to spend their eternal life together. After presenting Eleanor with a house designed specifically for her preferences, Michael introduces her to her soulmate, Chidi Anagonye (William Jackson Harper), a Senegalese ethics professor. When Michael leaves, Eleanor reveals to Chidi that everything Michael said about her life is wrong and she's not the person he says she is. Eleanor made a living by knowingly selling a worthless supplement to the sick and elderly and was crass and uncaring, not recalling any good action she's ever done. Michael then introduces Eleanor and Chidi to Tahani Al-Jamil (Jameela Jamil) and her soulmate Jianyu Li (Manny Jacinto), their neighbors. Tahani is a wealthy philanthropist while Jianyu is a Buddhist monk who has decided to keep his vow of silence. While on a party hosted by Tahani and Jianyu at their mansion, Chidi begins to question whether to help Eleanor or not. The next morning, Eleanor wakes up to discover that many things that represent her crass comments about her life and her insults to Tahani at the party are wreaking havoc on the Good Place. Chidi tells her that remaining in the Good Place is cause for the incident and her actions are affecting it. Eleanor then asks Chidi to help her become a better person just as Michael knocks on the door to inform them of an emergency meeting. Production Development NBC issued a press release on August 13, 2015, announcing it had given the then untitled show a 13-episode order based purely on a pitch by Michael Schur. On January 2016, it was announced Drew Goddard was going to direct the first episode. According to Schur, the premise and idea was to include religious elements into the series after doing research on various faiths and groups, but he decided to scrap the plans, instead going for a concept that included all faiths that was diverse and free of religious views. \\"I stopped doing research because I realized it's about versions of ethical behavior, not religious salvation,\\" he says. \\"The show isn't taking a side, the people who are there are from every country and religion.\\" Schur also points out that the setting (shot in San Marino, California's Huntington Gardens) already had the feeling of a pastiche of different cultures, stating that the neighborhoods will feature people who are part of nondenominational and interdenominational backgrounds that interact with each other regardless of religion. The series' setting and premises, as well as the serialized cliffhangers, were modeled on Lost, a favorite of Schur. One of the first people he called when he developed the series was Lost co-creator Damon Lindelof. In an interview, he remarked, \\"I took him to lunch and said, 'We're going to play a game [of] 'Is this anything?'\\" He then added, \\"I imagine this going in the Lost way, with cliffhangers and future storylines.\\" His discussions with Lindelof were a key factor in why he \\"didn't pitch [the show] to NBC until [he] had the whole idea, because of hearing [Lindelof] talk about the process of writing a show that has these qualities and how hard it can be.\\" Instead, he planned out the season and where \\"the big tentpole episodes\\" would go; this plan would deviate little during production of the first season. Casting On January 12, 2016, it was announced that Kristen Bell and Ted Danson had been cast in the lead roles for the series. The first synopsis of the show was also released, stating that the show was set to revolve around Eleanor designing her own self-improvement course with Michael acting as her guide – although the afterlife element had always been a part of the series, as Kristen Bell has stated she was aware of the first- season finale twist when she signed onto the show. William Jackson Harper was cast as Chris on February 11, 2016, though the character was renamed Chidi. Jameela Jamil was cast as Tessa on February 25, 2016, and her character was renamed Tahani. On March 3, 2016, Manny Jacinto was revealed to have been cast as a \\"sweet and good-natured Jason\\" whose \\"dream is to make a living as a DJ in Southern Florida\\". On March 14, 2016, D'Arcy Carden was cast in the final series regular role as Janet Della-Denunzio, a violin salesperson with a checkered past – though the character was completely reworked, she retained her original first name in the series. Reception Viewers In its original American broadcast, \\"Everything Is Fine\\" was seen by an estimated 8.04 million household viewers and gained a 2.3/8 ratings share among adults aged 18–49, according to Nielsen Media Research. This means that 2.3 percent of all households with televisions watched the episode, while 8 percent of all households watching television at that time watched it. With these ratings, The Good Place was the second most watched show on NBC for the night, behind The Voice, first on its timeslot and fourth for the night in the 18-49 demographics, behind Kevin Can Wait, The Voice, and The Big Bang Theory. Reviews Overall, the episode received generally positive reviews from critics. In a review from an advance screening at San Diego Comic-Con, Matt Fowler of IGN gave the episode a 7.2 out of 10. He described the show as \\"a whimsically bureaucratic look at the afterlife\\" that could \\"stand on its own as a slice of unique, fun TV.\\" He noted that Bell and Danson \\"delight\\" but \\"the rest of the ensemble needs work.\\" Dennis Perkins of The A.V. Club gave the pilot and the following episode, \\"Flying\\", an A-. He praised Schur's version of the afterline, remarking that \\"the good place’s rules and eccentricities [are] fairly bursting with comic ingenuity and fiddly little bits of weirdness that promise a renewable supply of laughs and interest.\\" He also called Bell \\"the perfect choice for Eleanor, as her innate brightness keeps us rooting for Eleanor to brazen her way through her mistaken admittance to paradise.\\" In another review of the first two episodes, Noel Murray of Vulture gave 4 out of 5 stars, calling the show \\"clever, funny, and pleasantly familiar.\\" He remarked, \\"Teasing a few mysteries is always a strong way to launch a series, though The Good Place doesn’t dwell on them at the expense of telling good jokes.\\" References External links * * Category:2016 American television episodes Category:The Good Place episodes ","title":"Everything Is Fine (The Good Place)"},{"id":"57736318","text":"A force-sensing capacitor is a material whose capacitance changes when a force, pressure or mechanical stress is applied. They are also known as \\"force-sensitive capacitors\\". They can provide improved sensitivity and repeatability compared to force-sensitive resistors but traditionally required more complicated electronics.  Operation principle  Typical force sensitive capacitors are examples of parallel plate capacitors. For small deflections, there is a linear relationship between applied force and change in capacitance, which can be shown as follows: The capacitance, C, equals \\\\varepsilon A /d , where \\\\varepsilon is permeability, A is the area of the sensor and d is the distance between parallel plates. If the material is linearly elastic (so follows Hooks Law), then the displacement, due to an applied force F, is x=F/k, where k is the spring constant. Combining these equations gives the capacitance after an applied force as: : C =\\\\varepsilon A /(d_{nominal}-F/k) , where d_{nominal} is the separation between parallel plates when no force is applied. This can be rearranged to: : C = (\\\\varepsilon Ad_{nominal} + \\\\varepsilon AF/k)/(d_{nominal}^2-F^2/k^2) Assuming that d_{nominal}^2 >> F^2/k^2 , which is true for small deformations where d_{nominal} >> x , we can simplify this to: :C \\\\simeq(\\\\varepsilon Ad_{nominal} + \\\\varepsilon AF/k)/(d_{nominal}^2) It follows that: :C \\\\simeq C_{nominal} + \\\\varepsilon AF/kd_{nominal}^2 :C \\\\simeq C_{nominal} + BF where B = \\\\epsilon A/kd^2 , which is constant for a given sensor. We can express the change in capacitance \\\\Delta C as: : \\\\Delta C = BF  Production  SingleTact makes force-sensitive capacitors using moulded silicon between two layers of polymide to construct a 0.35mm thick sensor, with force ranges from 1N to 450N. The 8mm SingleTact has a nominal capacitance of 75pF, which increases by 2.2pF when the rated force is applied.  Uses  Force-sensing capacitors can be used to create low-profile force- sensitive buttons. They have been used in medical imaging to map pressures in the esophagusand to image breast and prostate cancer.

Everard Napier (9 October 1888, Preston, Lancashire – 15 December 1957, Silchester, Hampshire) was a British tropical physician and professor of tropical medicine, known for his 1946 textbook Principles and Practice of Tropical Medicine and his 1923 book, coauthored by Ernest Muir, Kala Azar: A Handbook for Students and Practitioners. Napier graduated from St John's School, Leatherhead and then studied medicine at St Bartholomew's Hospital, qualifying M.R.C.S. and L.R.C.P. in 1914. From 1915 to 1918 he served in the R.A.M.C. He served in the Mediterranean and in Egypt, in hospital ships and troop transports, and then in Mesopotamia, where he succeeded Hugh W. Acton as pathologist. During WWI Napier also served in Bombay, where he succeeded Robert Knowles as pathologist, and then returned to England in 1919. Acton and Knowles became professors at the newly formed School of Tropical of Medicine at Calcutta and persuaded Knowles to join the staff as a pathologist and special research worker in kala-azar. Ernest Struthers and Napier advanced the hypothesis that the sand-fly transmitted kala-azar. He remained at Calcutta's School of Tropical Medicine for 22 years, becoming in 1935 a professor of tropical medicine (as successor to Ernest Muir) and later the School's director. In 1943 Napier left India. For the Indian Medical Gazette he served as assistant editor for five years and editor for ten years. In 1943 he went to New York City's Columbia University as a visiting professor and while there completed his 1946 textbook Principles and Practice of Tropical Medicine. After his return to England in 1946, he became editor of the Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.

Simon. The film is a remake of the 2010 French film of the same name, originally called À bout portant. It stars Frank Grillo, Anthony Mackie, Marcia Gay Harden, Teyonah Parris, Boris McGiver, and Markice Moore. It was digitally released on Netflix on July 12, 2019. Plot Abe Guevara is caught in a shootout at a residential home that results in the death of District Attorney Joshua Gregory. He is chased on foot and attempts to escape with his brother Mateo, but Abe is hit by a car, and is subsequently sent to a local hospital. A pair of homicide detectives, Regina Lewis and Eric Masterson, are assigned to the case. Paul Booker, an everyman ER nurse, is assigned to oversee Abe's recovery at the hospital. Mateo, determined to break Abe out in order to pay off a debt with Big D, an influential gangster, kidnaps Paul's pregnant wife Taryn and coerces Paul into working for him. Paul breaks out Abe on his stretcher, and evade detectives Lewis and Masterson just shortly after they arrive. Abe reveals that he is in possession of a flash drive, that can expose several corrupt police officers; while making the deal to distribute the flash drive to Gregory, they were ambushed, and Abe was wrongfully incriminated for his death. Abe arranges to meet Mateo at a bus station, but realizing that it is a sting operation, they incite a shootout and flee, engaging in a car chase. After fighting off more cops at a car wash, they escape on foot. Seeking a new car, they consult a local gangster, Cheetah. Lewis and Masterson arrive, and hold them all at gunpoint. Masterson realizes that Lewis is one of the corrupt cops on the drive, leading her to kill both Masterson and Cheetah. Paul kills her accomplice Jones while she is distracted with incoming reinforcements. Abe rendezvouses with Mateo, but he is ambushed for the drive as well by one of Lewis' men, who abduct Taryn. Abe and Paul arrive at the rendezvous, only to find Mateo mortally wounded. He succumbs to his injuries, and dies. Lewis threatens the two, revealing that she is holding Taryn hostage. Having taken into his possession security footage that incriminates Lewis of her corrupt actions, Abe finalizes a deal with Big D and pays off his debt. Big D stages a distraction outside the police precinct, both to accommodate to Paul and Abe, but to also capture footage for a movie he is developing. Disguised as a first responder and a police officer, Paul and Abe incapacitate Lewis, and save Taryn, who goes into labour and gives birth to their baby boy. In the aftermath, Lewis is killed by police reinforcements after Abe exposes her corruption. One year later, Paul and Taryn celebrate their baby boy's first birthday, who they name Matty in Mateo's honor. Abe smiles upon seeing a picture of Matty's first birthday cake, and drives into the sunset, tailed by a black SUV.

It was designed by John McDonald and built in 1892 by the New South Wales Public Works Department. The property is owned by Roads and Maritime Services, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 20 June 2000.  History  State transport and public works records indicate that it was built in 1892 for a cost of A£2,964.  Description  The bridge consists of two truss spans flanked by two timber girder spans at each end (one and one span at each end). All are supported by timber piers with piles driven into rock. The bridge width is between kerbs at its narrowest. It was reported to be in generally fair to good condition as at 13 September 2005, with maintenance by Roads and Maritime Services as it is a functioning road bridge.  Heritage listing  This bridge is a McDonald timber truss road bridge. Timber truss road bridges were extensively used in New South Wales because of the high quality of local hardwoods and the shortage of steel during the early decades of settlement of the state. The timber truss was highly developed for bridges in New South Wales, perhaps more so than anywhere else in the world at that time. The McDonald truss is a significant evolutionary link in the development of timber road bridges in New South Wales and has three standard span lengths, , , and . At March 1998 there were seven McDonald truss road bridges remaining in New South Wales, this bridge being a representative example. The bridge has been assessed as having State Significance. Crankies Plain Bridge was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 20 June 2000 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. McDonald truss bridges have historical significance because timber truss bridges were developed and refined in Australia to achieve the highest level of timber bridge construction for the time of their design and the McDonald truss is an important recognisable design in the evolution of timber truss bridges in NSW. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. McDonald truss bridges have aesthetic significance because they are evocative of Australian methods of bridge construction, in their materials, scale and configuration they reflect and express nineteenth century technologies and experiences and for the time of their design and construction they demonstrate the best quality design available. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. McDonald truss bridges have social significance because their size and location contribute directly to the local area and they are a strong element in the local address.

Early life Mary, who was known as Minnie, was born on December 12, 1850 at Powel House, her family home in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She was the daughter of William Henry Rawle (1823–1889) and Mary Binney (née Cadwalader) Rawle (1829–1861), both from prominent old Philadelphia families, the Rawles and the Cadwaladers. She had one younger brother, who died young of diphtheria in 1860, around the same time her mother died. Her father, with whom she had a warm relationship, was a prominent attorney in Philadelphia with Rawle & Henderson, a firm founded by her great-grandfather in 1783. When she was eighteen years old, her father remarried to Emily Cadwalader, the daughter of Thomas McCall Cadwalader, her mother's cousin and Mary's own cousin twice removed. Her paternal grandparents were William Rawle Jr. and Mary Anna (née Tilghman) Rawle, the granddaughter of Chief Justice Benjamin Chew. Her great-grandfather was William Rawle, the U.S. District Attorney in Pennsylvania who was a founder, and first president, of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania, a president of the Pennsylvania Abolition Society, and a trustee of the University of Pennsylvania for 40 years. Her mother was the eldest daughter of John Cadwalader, a U.S. Representative and Federal Judge, and his first wife, Mary (née Binney) Cadwalader, a daughter of Horace Binney, also a U.S. Representative who was known for his public speeches as well as the founding of the Hasty Pudding Club at Harvard. Society life In 1892, both Mary and her daughter were listed as \\"Mrs. F.R. Jones\\" and \\"Miss Beatrix Jones\\" in Ward McAllister's \\"Four Hundred\\", purported to be an index of New York's best families, published in The New York Times. Conveniently, 400 was the number of people that could fit into Mrs. Astor's ballroom. In her New York Times obituary, it stated: > \\"She held an unquestioned position in the small circle of men and women who > directed New York's society at the close of the last century, and after the > letting down of the bars in recent years she continued to be regarded as one > of those for whom exclusiveness still had value.\\" She was known for the artistic salon at her New York home, where she entertained the most prominent authors and artists of the day, including Augustus Saint-Gaudens, John Singer Sargent, novelist Francis Marion Crawford, John LaFarge, and Henry Adams (who considered her and novelist Howard Sturgis his best friends). Minnie was known for her \\"wider view of the world\\" than most 19th century women, and her close relationships with men, which she viewed as the \\"most natural, and even desirable, thing in the world.\\" Personal life Photograph of Mary's daughter, architect Beatrix Farrand. On March 24, 1870, she was married to Frederic Rhinelander \\"Freddy\\" Jones (1846–1918) in New York City. Jones was the elder son of George Frederic Jones and Lucretia (née Stevens) Rhinelander Jones. His younger sister was famed Pulitzer Prize winning novelist Edith Newbold (née Jones) Wharton, known for her novel The Age of Innocence. Minnie and Freddy lived at 21 East 11th Street, which she retained after their divorce, living there for 50 years in total. Together, they were the parents of one child: * Beatrix Cadwalader Jones (1872–1959), a prominent landscape architect who in 1913 married Dr. Max Farrand (1869–1945), a Stanford and Yale University historian who served as the first director of the Huntington Library. Max was the brother of Cornell University President Livingston Farrand. Minnie and Freddy began living apart in 1891, five years before divorcing in 1896, and thereafter was known as Mrs. Cadawalader Jones. Despite their divorce, Minnie remained close friends with her ex-husband's sister Edith. When Freddy died at his residence in Paris in 1918, neither Minnie or Edith mourned him. On September 22, 1935, en route back to New York City after spending summer at Le Pavillon Colombe, Wharton's home on Rue de Montmorency in Saint-Brice-sous-Forêt, Minnie died of pneumonia in London, England. Edith coordinated the funeral arrangements and she was buried at St John the Baptist Churchyard in Aldbury, Hertfordshire, England, next to fellow writer Mary Augusta Ward. Philanthropy She was active as a volunteer worker at the New York City Hospital School, where she eventually became the chairwoman of the advisory board of the Nursing School. Legacy The Jones' summer home or cottage, known as the Reef Point Estate, in Bar Harbor on Mount Desert Island in Maine. Mary deeded Reef Point to her daughter Beatrix in 1917. After Mary's death in 1935, her daughter and son-in-law turned Reef Point into a horticultural study center. Published works * A Book About Fans; The History Of Fans and Fan-Painting (with M. A.

He was involved in treaty negotiations with the U.S. government. In 1879, he fought during the Meeker Massacre. Eight years later, his family members were attacked during Colorow's War. He was placed in the Jefferson County Hall of Fame in recognition of for the contributions that \\"he made to our county and, indeed, our state and nation.\\" Early life Colorow was born a Comanche about 1810. Five years later there was a battle in Northern New Mexico which resulted in him being kidnapped by the Muache band of Utes. He received the nickname \\"Red\\" or \\"Colorado\\" for his particularly red skin, as compared to the Utes. Career Colorow Point Park, in Golden, Colorado is listed on the National Register of Historic Places Colorow was a skilled horseman and warrior. He traveled across the trails of Colorado, having known many chiefs of other tribes, fur trappers, military men, and the Spanish. He visited Colorado towns. He engaged in battles with the Arapaho, one near Aspen where he was called a hero and another at North Table Mountain and South Table Mountain that was so severe that the Utes and Arapaho did not want to return to the area. In 1856, a band of Arapaho and Cheyenne stole about 40 Ute horses. With Nevava and Ouray, Colorow fought for the stolen horses and although outnumbered eight-to-one were able to retrieve them and killed four of the enemy. Colorow traveled with the band and more than 1,000 horses and goats to the foothills of the Rocky Mountains near present-day Denver. A camp was first established on Lookout Mountain until fresh pastures were required. They then moved to Rooney Valley, east of Dinosaur Ridge near Morrison. They stayed near mineral springs, called \\"Iron Spring\\". Other Native American tribes—Cheyenne, Arapaho, Kiowa, and Companche—visited the springs, but the visits were always peaceful there. Colorow held tribal councils at \\"Inspirational Tree\\" or \\"Council Tree\\" at the foot of Dinosaur Ridge. He used a cave near Morrison for temporary shelter, which was named for him, Colorow's Cave. The town of Mount Vernon was built in the area in 1860, and Rooney Ranch that was built in their grazing area. He also spent part of each summer with his band in the Roaring Fork Valley between Aspen and Gunnison, Colorado. He was a sub-chief by 1868 and was considered for the chief of the Northern Ute. He was involved in treaty negotiations with the United States government and met with President Ulysses S. Grant at a reception in Denver in 1873. He identified himself as a Yampa and Grand River Ute when he signed the 1878 treaty. During the Meeker Massacre (1879), he first tried to negotiate for peace and ultimately was said to have stabbed Nathan Meeker in the mouth to stop his lies. The conflict led to Utes being put on reservations. Colorow left for the Uintah and Ouray Indian Reservation in August 1881, and under a treaty he continued to hunt in western Colorado and did not spend much time on the reservation. In 1887, some minor incidents occurred near Meeker, Colorado, which caused a Rio Blanco County sheriff to establish a posse and hunt down Utes. He burned down Chipeta's camp and injured many of Colorow's family members, include sons, sons-in-law, and grandsons. Utes had begun to return to Utah when a state militia of about 1,000 men began shooting at them. They were rescued by Buffalo Soldiers from Fort Duchesne. The incident, which caused the loss of more than $30,000 () in property, was called Colorow's War. Personal life He married three women, who may all have been sisters. His first wife, Recha, gave birth to three of his children Uncompahgre Colorow, Patchoorowits \\"Gus\\", and a girl named Topollywack. Recha died when riding a horse; she fell off the horse and her foot was caught in the stirrup and she was dragged to her death. He had six other children with sisters Poopa and Siha by 1857. He died on the Ouray Reservation on December 11, 1888 and was buried three days later.

Size comparison The Obusier de 400 Modèle 1915/1916 were French Railroad Howitzers that saw action during the First World War and Second World Wars. The mle 1915/1916 was the largest caliber Railroad Howitzers in service with the French Army during the First World War. History Although the majority of combatants had heavy field artillery prior to the outbreak of the First World War, none had adequate numbers of heavy guns in service, nor had they foreseen the growing importance of heavy artillery once the Western Front stagnated and trench warfare set in. Since aircraft of the period were not yet capable of carrying large diameter bombs the burden of delivering heavy firepower fell on the artillery. Two sources of heavy artillery suitable for conversion to field use were surplus coastal defense guns and naval guns. However, a paradox faced artillery designers of the time, while large caliber naval guns were common, large caliber land weapons were less common due to their weight, complexity, and lack of mobility. Large caliber field guns often required extensive site preparation because the guns had to be broken down into multiple loads light enough to be towed by a horse team or the few traction engines of the time and then reassembled before use. Building a new gun could address the problem of disassembling, transporting and reassembling a large gun, but it didn't necessarily address how to convert existing heavy weapons to make them more mobile. Rail transport proved to be the most practical solution because the problems of heavy weight, lack of mobility and reduced setup time were addressed. Design Perhaps influenced by the success of the German's Big Bertha howitzer at the Belgian forts at Liège, Namur, and Antwerp, and the French fort at Maubeuge the French Army issued a requirement for new heavy artillery capable of destroying deeply dug in German trenches and concrete fortifications. Existing coastal defense guns and siege mortars had proven to be only moderately effective, so the new weapon would need to be much larger. Range and velocity were not primary considerations. Instead, high angle fire, projectile weight, and explosive yield were the primary considerations. Since the mle 1915/1916 were classified as howitzers instead of guns this meant that the barrel did not need to be very long. Since there wasn't enough spare industrial capacity or materials to produce a new weapon it was decided to convert surplus naval gun barrels instead. The barrels There were two models of howitzer produced the mle 1915 and mle 1916 which were differentiated by the gun barrels used: * On July 22, 1915, at the request of the French GHQ, the Ministry of War ordered the construction of eight model 1915 howitzers and rail carriages from Saint Chamond. The barrels for these howitzers were a conversion of existing Canon de Modèle 1887 L/42 naval guns which were shortened to 25 calibers and bored out to . The barrels came from the decommissioned pre-dreadnought battleship Brennus and the two Valmy-class coastal defense ships. Six barrels were converted in 1915, with three others following in early 1916. Of the nine barrels converted, eight were rail mounted while the ninth tube served as a test piece on the Gâvres firing range. * A second order was placed in January 1917 for four more model 1916 howitzers and rail carriages with three spare tubes. The barrels for these howitzers were a conversion of existing Canon de Modèle 1912 L/45 naval guns which were shortened to 25 calibers and bored out to 400 mm. These came from the canceled Normandie-class dreadnought battleships. Both the mle 1915 and mle 1916 had the same general characteristics and used the same projectiles. The theoretical barrel life was 1,000 shots and in case of heavy barrel wear it was planned to bore the barrels out again to , but this was never implemented. Before and after Compare the original naval gun and the modified howitzer, the mle 1915/1916 barrel is 25% shorter, the largest projectile weighs nearly twice as much, the muzzle velocity is only 60% of the original, and the range of the projectile is slightly less despite firing at greater angles of elevation. {  + Comparison of the 340 mm mle 1887 & 400 mm mle 1915/1916 ! !Length !Projectile !Velocity !Range - mle 1887  L/42    at 18° - mle 1915/1916  L/25    at 65° } Other conversions With the success of the mle 1915/1916 in mind, the French Army requested more howitzers be built. However, a lack of 340 mm barrels suitable for conversion forced them to find an alternative. The alternative was to convert surplus Canon de Modèle 1887 L/45 naval guns to using the same process of shortening the barrels, boring them out and building rail carriages for them. The resulting eight howitzers and four spare barrels were called the Obusier de 370 modèle 1915 and they served alongside the Obusier de 400 Modèle 1915/1916 in both World War I and World War II. Rail carriage The railway carriage for the howitzers was called the affut à Berceau Saint- Chamond and was used on a number of different railroad guns. The howitzers were mounted on rectangular steel bases, which were suspended on two railroad bogies. The rear bogie had four axles, while the front bogie had six axles. The number of axles was determined by the weight limit for European railways of 17 tonnes per axle and 17x10 = 170 tonnes. Since the barrels were naval guns that were not intended for use at high angles of elevation the trunnions were relocated relatively far forward and the howitzers were nose heavy which is why the front bogie had more axles than the rear. The howitzers had a Welin breech block and used separate loading bagged charges and projectiles. To load the howitzer the barrel was lowered to -8° and a loading ramp to the howitzer's breech could be erected. The howitzers had a hydro-pneumatic cradle recoil system where the cradle recoiled up a slightly inclined rear deck which helped return the howitzer to battery after firing. The carriage used ground platform anchoring and the rear bogie could be jacked up to help absorb recoil. The carriage used a car traversing mount so traverse was limited to a few degrees each side of the howitzers centerline. The howitzers normally required two days of setup before firing, which consisted of reinforcing an area of track with wooden beams and digging a pit for the earth anchor and another for howitzers breech at high angles of elevations more than 45°. There were also four jack stands that could be lowered onto the platform and fastened to the timbers to provide a stable firing platform. Battery organization French railroad batteries usually consisted of two trains. The first was the firing train, with a locomotive, a workshop wagon, two ammunition carriages, and one or two railway guns. The second was the administrative train, with a locomotive, additional ammunition carriages, a headquarters wagon, three or more berthing carriages, a kitchen wagon, and carriages for construction material and lifting equipment. In 1916 there were four batteries and in 1918 six batteries, each with two howitzers per army. Each battery was commanded by a captain of artillery, with a lieutenant and a total of 125 men. First world war Verdun The first use of the mle 1915/1916 was during the Battle of Verdun. Two mle 1915/1916's (those of the 77th Battery of the 3rd Foot Artillery Regiment) were deployed 13 km (8.1 mi) to the south-west at Baleycourt to participate in the preparation for the French counteroffensive on October 21, 1916. It is estimated that 373 rounds of 370 mm and 400 mm were fired during this battle. Fort Douaumont was the first to be hit and then Fort Vaux. On October 23, 1916, of the fifty or so shells striking the fort, six pierced the concrete, earth, and masonry defensive works. The first exploded in the infirmary, another in the hallway, three others smashed a casemate attached to the barracks and lastly, a munitions depot was hit, triggering a fire. Explosions and toxic gases forced the German garrison to evacuate the fort, allowing the French to reoccupy it the next day. The Somme The next use of the mle 1915/196 was during the artillery preparation of the Battle of the Somme. From June 30, 1916, they shelled the commune of Morcourt and reduced the fortified villages of Herbécourt, Estrées, and Belloy-en-Santerre to ruins. Second Battle of the Aisne In April 1917, the French offensive on the Chemin des Dames was accompanied by attacks north of Reims. The preparatory artillery strikes targeted the forts of Brimont, Witry-lès-Reims, and Berru, as well as tunnels and shelters under Mount Cornillet and Mont-sans-nom. The three tunnels were up to underground and could contain up to 3 battalions which could be used for German counterattacks. Aerial photographs showed the entrances and the ventilation shafts of this subterranean complex. This, supplemented by information provided by a prisoner, led to them being targeted. The first 12 shots targeted the tunnel's entrances to seal in the Germans. On May 20, 1917, the ventilation shafts were targeted and one of the shells, fired from Mourmelon-le-Petit penetrated the 30 meters of limestone and exploded in the tunnel's gallery killing more than 400 who died from the explosion, tunnel collapse, and asphyxiation. United States service At least two of these weapons were operated by the 53rd Coast Artillery Regiment, Coast Artillery Corps in France during World War I (almost all US Army-manned heavy and railway artillery in that war was operated by Coast Artillery units). The US Army built a one-off experimental 16-inch (406 mm) railway howitzer M1918 with some influence from the French design. Based on experience with these weapons, the Coast Artillery abandoned the low-angle disappearing carriage (after deploying one at Fort Michie, New York) for its next generation of large coast defense guns, the 16-inch gun M1919 and the 16-inch howitzer M1920. Barbette carriages with an elevation of 65 degrees were designed for the new weapons to allow plunging fire as enemy ships approached; this type of carriage was later used for new installations of 16-inch ex-Navy guns in World War II. Second World War All twelve howitzers were deployed to batteries of the 371° Regiment of the ALVF (Artillery lourde sur voie ferrée) in the Alsace and Lorraine area to reinforce the Maginot Line defenses. However, they saw no action due to a lack of targets in those sectors. After the French Armistice, eight of these were used by the Germans under the designation 40 cm Haubitze (Eisenbahn) 752(f). Two batteries ( Nos. 693 and 696) were composed of three howitzers each and were engaged during the Siege of Leningrad, the other two acted as spares. None are thought to have survived World War II.

Pickett, a professor (now emeritus) at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology in Terre Haute, Indiana. It was published as part of Harlan Davidson's American Biographical History Series.  Synopsis  Divided into six parts, the book chronicles Eisenhower's early life, wartime service, presidency and retirement. In addition to telling Eisenhower's life story, the book was a re-examination of his political legacy, part of a trend challenging previous historians' views of his presidency as weak. With access to previously classified documents from both the United States and Soviet Union, as well as eight months of research at the Eisenhower Library, Pickett was able to show a different side to Eisenhower. Eisenhower's approach to issues of power and strategy is a consistent theme throughout the book. Although Pickett acknowledges that Eisenhower's corporate ties and dislike of New Deal policies made him \\"[fail] to understand the problems of the poor, the elderly, and the many who suffered discrimination,\\" he argues that Eisenhower also brought to the White House a set of skills and experience that made him perhaps uniquely suited for handling the problems of the Cold War, helping to create the conditions for the peace, prosperity and economic growth that were the hallmark of the 1950s. The book suggests that the strategic talents Eisenhower displayed as Supreme Commander of Allied forces were not only the key to victory in Europe during World War Two, but carried over usefully to his second career as a civilian politician. Despite his military background, he believed in avoiding war and that the Cold War was a largely political and economic rather than military crisis. Despite Eisenhower's serious misgivings about the rise of corporate power and the military-industrial complex, which he warned against in his 1960 farewell address, Pickett suggests that Eisenhower's coolheadedness and focus on international affairs helped leave the world more stable than it was before his presidency, and established the dominance of the United States as both a world power and a haven for the world's refugees. Critical response Reaction to the book was positive. Indianapolis Star reviewer Lawrence S. Conner called it a \\"concise and readable\\" work that helped to revise previous historians' \\"harsh assessments of Eisenhower.\\" In the journal Presidential Studies Quarterly, Herbert Parmet called the book a \\"gracefully written … wise little book,\\" offering a view of Eisenhower as a politician who \\"understood and moved with the rhythms of history.\\" Writing in the Journal of American History, reviewer Robert J. McMahon called it an \\"admirably compact and lucid survey\\"; he felt that Pickett was not critical enough of Eisenhower's failures, but also felt the book had \\"marked strengths\\" including a lively writing style that made it an effective introduction to the Eisenhower era. Pickett followed up the book in 2000 with Eisenhower Decides to Run: Presidential Politics and Cold War Strategy, a look at the events and decisions that shaped the 1952 Republican Party presidential primaries and general election.

The canal, along with its counterpart Khlong Bangkok Yai, was constructed in 1552, during the reign of King Chairachathirat of the Ayutthaya Kingdom. He ordered the construction of a canal bypassing a loop of the Chao Phraya River to shorten travel time. The river was diverted through the new canal, and the old route became the two canals known today as Khlong Bangkok Yai and Khlong Bangkok Noi. In the early-Rattanakosin period, there was a floating market where vendor's boats and wooden houseboats mingled, lining up along the waterways to Bang Bamru and Bang Khun Non.

The vehicle is currently being marked with a price from 288,000 yuan to 298,000 yuan ($42,600-44,000). History Development of the BJ80 was reported as early as November 28, 2011 when spy shot photos revealed a concept vehicle, initially known as the BJ80V. The patent for the vehicle was revealed on February 15, 2012. At the time, the BJ80VJ's engines were taken from Nissan- made 2.0/2.2 engines. These were made with manual-only transmissions. Chinese media announced that development of the BJ80 started in 2012 with the BJ80V being made for the civilian market with the BJ80VJ made for the People's Liberation Army and other government agencies with the initial price set at 200,000 Yuan. The BJ80V debuted in April 2012 at the Beijing Auto Show as a concept vehicle. The PLA announced that the BJ80 would be deployed in a variety of roles, including command, utility and scout roles. On November 4, 2013, the PLA was said to be developed an airborne assault vehicle based on the SUV's chassis. Deliveries of the military-based SUV were reported to have started in early 2016 with Yongshi (勇士, Brave Warrior) markings at the rear SUV door. In December 30, 2013, there were rumors that the BJ80 could have a Saab-based 2.0 turbo engine. It was later confirmed that it would a Saab 2.3 turbo petrol engine. The SUV, now known as the BJ80, was unveiled as another concept vehicle for the 2014 Beijing Auto Show in April for production. BAIC mentioned that it would be known as the BJ80C during the BAS event. The price was announced at 300,000 Yuan. The use of the 2.8-liter engine instead of the 3.2-liter diesel engine was finalized by BAIC, but the former would be used for PLA vehicles. During the show, BAIC representatives claimed that the display vehicle was using a 4.0 V8 engine with an automatic transmission system in place. The BJ80C vehicle was unveiled at the 2015 Shanghai Auto Show. A BJ80C Safari vehicle was also unveiled in the show. On November 22, 2016 at the Guangzhou Auto Show, BAIC unveiled a version of the BJ80 meant for riot control duties, only available on special orders. It was made in cooperation with Transamerican Auto Parts, an American aftermarket-parts manufacturer that market parts for Jeeps and other off-road cars. On April 20 2017, Protean Electric has unveiled a prototype BJ80 PHEV vehicle at the Auto Shanghai 2017 convention to demonstrate its feasibility as an electric vehicle for potential buyers. Military variants of the SUV are equipped with a Cummins 2.8 liter four-cylinder diesel engine, having a max output on 160hp and 360nm. They're equipped with BeiDou Navigation Satellite System as a standard feature.http://auto.sina.com.cn/zz/2017-08-07/detail-ifyiswpt5672559.shtml 1st Generation (2016-2019) On February 16, 2016, the BJ80D was reported to be seen on the road of China, being made with a diesel engine only. The BJ80 is marketed with either 2.8-liter turbodiesel with 163 HP and a 6-speed manual gearbox or a gasoline engine 2.3 T (250 HP) with either a manual or automatic transmission, both 6-speed. The manual and automatic transmission has the Reverse gear on the upper left with a dial-type switch to change from high to low gear on the lower right side of the gearstick. The BJ80 was subsequently launched by BAIC on November 3, 2016 without the C included in the name. On December 26, 2016, BAIC released a luxury version of the BJ80 with new front and rear bumpers, new alloys, red brakes, a new bonnet with an air scoop and two individual rear seats instead of the 3-seat bench. Derivatives =6x6= On April 24, 2018, BAIC unveiled the 6x6 version of the BJ80 for the Beijing Motor Show. =SVOS 80= At IDET 2017, the Czech armored vehicle company SVOS unveiled the SVOS 80, presented by SVOS in cooperation with BAIC as a proof of concept. It is planned to offer the SVOS 80 for export throughout Europe. There are also plans to market the SUV for military use outside of China. According to SVOS, the vehicle was developed in order to provide a cheap alternative to the Land Rover Defender. The SVOS 80 has a 2.8-liter, four-cylinder Cummins diesel engine rated at EURO 4 emissions compliance, developing 120 kW and 340 Nm torque. A ZF automatic gearbox is fitted, coupled to a two-speed transfer case with selectable four-wheel drive. =IVM G80= Innoson Vehicle Manufacturing has announced the development of the IVM G80 for the African market on December 11, 2017.

An update was released on June 2020 with a 3.0 TT V6 engine and an 8-speed automatic transmission. In 2015, rumors were abound that Daimler were not pleased with BAIC copying the look of the G-Class Wagon with plans to force the company to kill the marketing of the vehicle. While the G-Wagon has influenced it, aspect of the vehicle was also based on Beijing Qishi S12, a Beijing-made Jeep Cherokee. In 2018, the BJ80 was put in a test against the G-Wagon in Yongding, Anhui Province under PLA supervision.https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/2178414/chinese- militarys-road-sport-utility-vehicle-toughest-planet Critics have accused the PLA of conducting the tests in favor of the BJ80 due to them supervising and evaluating the two SUVs since Mercedes has more experience and history in manufacturing and marketing the G-Wagon.

She and her husband Percy Ure conducted important excavations at Ritsona in Boeotia, Greece, making her one of the first female archaeologists to lead an excavation in Greece.'Biography of Annie Ure', Ure Museum of Greek Archaeology. Reading: 2016. Biography Annie Dunman Hunt was born in Worcester on January 3, 1893, to George Henry Hunt, a watchmaker and jeweller, and his wife Elizabeth Ann. In her childhood, she attended Stoneycroft School, a girls' boarding school in Southport, and in 1911, Hunt was accepted to University of Reading to read Classics. As Reading did not yet have a university charter, she received her B.A. from the University of London in 1914. After spending the duration of the First World War teaching at the college's Classics department, she married her former professor Percy Ure in 1918, who had personally asked for Hunt to fill in for the members of staff who had been conscripted in the war.A Short Biography of Professor Percy Ure Commemorating 100 Years of the Classics Department Collection 1909–2009. Reading: Sally Fox, 2009. In the years 1921 and 1922, the Ures excavated in the Greek hamlet of Ritsona, Boeotia, resuming excavations that had been started by Percy and Ronald M. Burrows between 1905 and 1909.A.J.B. Wace, 'Archaeology in Greece, 1919-21', The Journal of Hellenic Studies 41 (2): 265-6. doi:10.2307/625501 The site was believed to correspond to the ancient necropolis of Mykalessos, a town mentioned in Thucydides' Peloponnesian War to have suffered a massacre at the hands of Thracian mercenaries. Focused primarily on burials, the excavations produced a significant host of Boeotian pottery, which were important in their contribution to the classification and dating of Greek ceramics.S.C. Bakhuizen, 'Salganeus and the Fortifications on Its Mountains', 1970, p. 18, cited in H. McAllister, The Princeton Encyclopedia of Classical Sites, 1976.V, Sabetai. 'Ronald M. Burrows and Percy N. Ure in Boeotia', Academy of Athens, 2006. (archive copy) Percy and Annie co-authored several important books on finds at Ritsona, and in 1922 founded Reading's Museum of Greek Archaeology. Ure assumed an honorary role as its first curator, a position she kept until her death. During these years, she travelled for study and research in museums across Europe, and was elected as a corresponding member of the German Archaeological Institute. Annie also taught at the Abbey School and within the Department of Classics at the University of Reading. Together, the Ures published well as over fifty articles on Greek pottery, until Percy's death in 1950. In 1954, Ure published a collaborative volume alongside her late husband in the international Corpus vasorum antiquorum series, which covered about half of the current Ure Museum collection. This monograph was described as a 'monument to their exacting diligence', and covered 'lesser known styles and classes of Greek pottery, seldom encountered in the plates of other fasicules'. It 'won wide aclaim' at an academic meeting in Lyon in 1956. Ure died 13 July 1976, at the age of 83, ten days after receiving an Honorary Doctorate from the University of Reading. She was survived by her two children, Bill and Jean.  Publications  *A. Ure. 1922 A Black-figure Fragment in the Dorset Museum, Journal of Hellenic Studies 42: 192-97. *P. Ure and A. Ure. 1927.

It was built from 1840 to 1874. It was also known as Banks Inn. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The Old Sir Joseph Banks Hotel is a large former bayside hotel of considerable historical and architectural worth, which remains virtually intact from early Victorian times. The building was begun by Thomas Kellet and J. Drew in 1840, and it (then known as the Banks Inn) had by the 1850s developed gardens, a private zoo and provision for outdoor sports. It became a popular weekend and holiday pleasure ground. About 1860, a further single storey wing to the east was added. The main two-storey north wing was added 1870 in Italianate style. It was bought in 1884 by entrepreneur Frank Smith, who set up famous running races from 1884–92, and later passed into hands of breweries. In 1920, a new hotel was built on Botany Road - the modern Sir Joseph Banks Hotel - and both the old hotel's name and license were transferred to the new hotel. It remained vacant until being sold to James Ruttley in 1930, and remained in the family as a residence for many years. The hotel was again sold, restored and converted into apartments 2000. A new apartment block was built next to the former hotel at that time.  Description  The former hotel consists of a large complex of stuccoed brick. The first part was begun in 1840, being a two-storey Georgian building, with flanking single-storey wings, named the Banks Inn. About 1860, a further single storey wing to the east was added with curved facade and verandah and steeply pitched hipped roofs. The main two- storey north wing was added 1870 in Italianate style, heavily ornamented with slab. It featured parapets and two storey cast iron verandahs and an interior of carved cedar.

The law is known informally in New Zealand public, media and government circles as the \\"three-strikes law\\". The bill passed its third reading on 25 May 2010. It was supported by the conservative National and libertarian ACT parties but was opposed by the Labour, Green, and Māori parties. It became law when it received royal assent on 31 May 2010. Legislative features The Sentencing and Parole Reform Act 2010 creates a three-stage system of increasing consequences for repeat serious violent offenders. The Act covers 40 qualifying offences comprising all major violent and sexual offences with a maximum penalty of seven years or greater imprisonment, including murder, attempted murder, manslaughter, wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, sexual violation, abduction, kidnapping, and aggravated robbery. Since the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 prohibits retroactive application of laws to disadvantage an offender, the law only applies to offences committed on or after 1 June 2010. A first warning is issued after an offender who is aged 18 or over is convicted of a qualifying offence. Once the offender has received a \\"first-strike\\" warning, it stays on their criminal record permanently unless their conviction is overturned. The warning must be given verbally by the Judge and followed up in writing for it to be valid. If the offender is subsequently convicted of another qualifying offence, they receive a final warning. If they are sentenced to a term of imprisonment, they will serve that sentence in full without the possibility of parole. The first and final warnings will stay on the offender's record. On conviction of a third qualifying offence, the court must impose the maximum penalty for the offence on the defendant. The legislation stipulates that if the offence the court must also order that the sentence be served without parole, unless the qualifying offence is manslaughter or court considers that it would be manifestly unjust. In cases of manslaughter, a minimum non-parole period of 20 years applies instead, unless the court considers that it would be manifestly unjust, in which case the standard 10-year non-period for life imprisonment applies. If the second or third qualifying offence is murder, then the court must impose a sentence of life imprisonment without possibility of parole, unless it deems it manifestly unjust to do so.Sentencing and Parole Reform Act 2010, Section 86E In the case a previous qualifying offence is overturned, the courts must set aside all other qualifying offences' sentences and warnings, and re-sentence and re-warn as if the overturned offence never occurred. Sentencing judges for second and third qualifying offences must state in their sentencing judgment the sentence they would have given but for the Act to assist in case of re-sentencing.Sentencing and Parole Reform Act 2010, Section 86F and 86G History The Sentencing and Parole Reform Act was first introduced into the New Zealand House of Representatives on 18 February 2009. Per New Zealand Parliamentary process, the proposed law went through three readings. It passed its first reading on 18 May 2009. The select committee reported back to the House on 26 March 2010, recommending the bill to proceed with modifications. The largest modification was changing the third strike penalty from life imprisonment with 25 years non-parole to the maximum sentence without parole, after the Attorney-General found the original penalty breached the cruel and unusual punishment provisions in the New Zealand Bill of Right Acts. The Sentencing and Parole Reform Bill passed its second reading on 4 May 2010. On 25 May 2010, the Act passed its third and final reading; becoming law on 31 May 2010. While the ruling National and ACT parties supported the Sentencing and Parole Reform Act, the government's support partner the Māori Party joined the opposition Labour and Green parties in opposing the law's passage. Since its passage, the so-called \\"three-strikes law\\" has been controversial in New Zealand society. Critics have criticized the Sentencing and Parole Reform Act for its alleged punitive approach to justice and for disproportionately affected the Māori community. By contrast, it has been supported by conservative advocacy groups such as the Sensible Sentencing Trust and Family First New Zealand. In August 2016, the Court of Appeal in R v Harrison & Ors established the scope of the \\"manifestly unjust\\" provision in section 86E. The Crown appealed two cases involving murder as the second qualifying offence where the sentencing judges exercised the manifestly unjust provision and refused to give the mandatory sentence of life imprisonment without parole. The first qualifying offence in each case was indecent assault and wounding with intent to injure, both which carry a maximum penalty of 7 years imprisonment and therefore at the bottom of the scale of serious violent offence. The Court dismissed the appeal, ruling that in order to not breach the cruel and unusual punishment provisions in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act, manifest injustice had to have a broad scope. This ruling has effectively made section 86E of the Act unenforceable, at least if murder is a second qualifying offence following a non-homicide first qualifying offence. Following the formation of the Labour coalition government after the 2017 general election, Labour's Justice Minister Andrew Little announced that it would be scrapping the three-strikes law. Little argued that the law was doing little to facilitate rehabilitation of violent offenders and was contributing to New Zealand's growing prison population. Little's announcement was criticized by ACT Party leader David Seymour. On 30 May 2018, Justice Minister Little announced that the Labour coalition government would be taking steps to repeal the \\"three-strikes law\\" in early June. In response, the Sensible Sentencing Trust's founder Garth McVicar commissioned a poll of 965 adults which claimed that 68 percent of New Zealanders approved of the law and 20 percent did not; including 63 percent of Labour supporters and 48 percent of Green supporters. On 11 June 2018, Andrew Little announced that the Government would be abandoning its efforts to repeal the \\"three-strikes law\\" due to opposition from its coalition partner, the populist conservative New Zealand First.

S. G. Taylor as a Regiment Commander. At the beginning of the First World War (1914-1918). So that time many non- combatant soldiers and skilled and unskilled laborers were also recruited from Bengal. In middle 1916, the British Government decided to create a regiment of Bengali soldiers. At first, it was called Bengali Double Company. These Double Companies, each consisting of 228 soldiers, are thought to annex with Indian Army as a regiment. The Bengali Double Company raised the first Bengali Battalion on 26 June 1917. It was named the 49th Bengalee regiment or briefly the 49th Bengalee. It was disbanded in 1920. Formation Governor of Bengal Lord Carmichael announced to form Bengali Army companies at the concluding session of the Legislative Council in Dhaka On 7 August 1916. That time the leaders of Bengal also decided to form a Bengali Regiment Committee to extend cooperation to the government in recruiting companies. And then the central office was established in Calcutta (now Kolkata) and many branch offices were formed at all districts and at some major subdivisions. The committee ran campaigns through public meetings, newspaper publicity, and other means to enthuse people to join the Bengali Double Companies where important leaders, zamindars, and social leaders also attended these meetings. The government very earnestly solicited their cooperation. The programme to recruit Bengalis for the Double Companies began on 30 August 1916 at the Fort Williams Cantonment in Calcutta. The first ten soldiers of the Bengali Double Company left Calcutta on September 12 for Naushera for training. Subsequently, more groups of recruits left for Naushera. There the 46th Punjab Regiment was in charge of their training. The first regiment of 228 soldiers of the Bengali Double Company arrived in Karachi in January 1914 after four months of training at Naushera. This Bengali Battalion was not like an ordinary army unit. Basically, young men from educated middle-class families had joined as soldiers. Many of them were in jobs with good salaries before joining the army. Some had graduation, masters or law degrees. Some young sons of nawabs and zamindars and of rich families also joined the Bengali Battalion. Although Indian soldiers were not allowed to rise as commissioned officers, but £115 million was paid from the Indian exchequer. In the war Monument in College Square in Kolkata The first battalion of the Bengali Regiment divided into three groups left Karachi in July 1917 to take part in the Mesopotamian war and by mid-September reached Baghdad. But in Baghdad a good number of soldiers became sick and some of them died. So that the 49th Bengalis were transferred from Baghdad to the city of Azizia and by mid-March to Al Kut. Still, there was no significant improvement in their health in Al Kut. Then, towards the end of October, they were sent to Tanuma near Basra. While at Al Kut, Tanuma and Azizia, the Bengalis performed mainly security duties alongside receiving military training. By November 1918 armistice was declared. At Tanuma the Bengalis performed the post-war rehabilitation duties. Some of the soldiers were engaged in Baghdad and elsewhere. After the Mesopotamian war, there was a revolt in Kurdistan in April 1919. As many as 235 Bengalis were engaged in suppressing this rebellion. After coming back to Kolkata in August 1920, the Bengali Battalion got disbanded on 30 August 1920. After the first battalion of the 49th Bengali Regiment left for Baghdad in July 1917, its remaining soldiers stayed in Karachi and continued to receive military training. This group of the Bengalis was called Karachi Depot. A group of the Bengali Battalion that stayed in Calcutta was called Calcutta Depot where the new recruits stayed. The soldiers of the Karachi Depot also used to stay here while in transit from leave or on some duty. As a large number of soldiers from East Bengal were recruited in September 1918, a Depot was also opened in Dhaka called Dhaka Depot. Some of the soldier from the Platoon are Shamal Bhattacharya (Dhaka), Jagadish Chandra Bose (Dhaka), Satyanarayan Bose (Dhaka), Abdul Rahman (Dhaka) Suresh Chandra Bose (Dhaka), Mohan Dey (Dhaka) Harshgovinda Dey (Chittagong), Bharat Chowdhury (Faridpur), Surendranath Ghosh (Faridpur), A.

To honor their memory a commemorative statue was erected at Calcutta College Square in August 1924. In one side of the monument, inscribed in the words: The other three sides of the memorial base contain the names of the 49 Bengalis killed in the Great War of 1914–1918. It also contains the following information of Reg. No., Rank, Date of Death, District from which come. The districts are Midnapore, Mymensingh, Murshidabad, Nadia, Calcutta, Jessore, Burdwan, Pabna, Chittagong, Khulna, Barisal, Faridpore, Pabna, 24-Parganas and Tripura (Tipperah). Some Bengali soldiers and officers received awards and recognition for their meritorious services in Mesopotamia. These recognitions were published in the official gazette. In July 1919 a victory march (rally) and peace celebration were held in London. Soldiers and officers from different parts of the world took part in it. One British officer and one Indian officer and two soldiers represented the 49th Bengali Regiment at this celebration.

She made considerable efforts to make JPL more diverse.  Early life  Ling was born in China and survived the Japanese bombing of Hong Kong. She studied at Canton College. She emigrated to the United States to attend college, and ended up studying at University of Notre Dame. She was the only woman to major in mathematics.  Career  Ling's brother worked at JPL, and she thought the job would be perfect for her. Ling was a supervisor for the computing group at JPL. She made efforts to only employ women computers during the late 1950s and early 1960s - the programming group used to call themselves \\"Helen's Girls\\". Ling's group were responsible for performing trajectory calculations. Ling encouraged women to attend night school and obtain the correct qualifications to work alongside her at JPL. At the time, women at JPL were forced to quit if they became pregnant. Instead of losing her talented team, Ling rehired women returning from maternity leave. The author Nathalia Holt believes that \\"a lot of women ended up becoming computer scientists and engineers at JPL thanks to Helen's guidance\\". Her high school crush, Canton College's student body president Arthur Ling, emigrated to America and married Ling. Ling developed software for the IRAS, Magellan, the TOPEX/Poseidon spacecraft and Mars Observer. She retired from JPL in 1994. Ling developed software for many missions over the years, including the Infrared Astronomical Satellite, Magellan, Mars Observer and Topex/Poseidon. Her work was respected by Charley Kohlhase, the Voyager mission designer, who didn't want anyone else to develop his software. Ling retired in 1994 but still keeps in touch with her former colleagues. She lives in South Pasadena, Calif., with her husband Art. Ling is referenced in the book Rise of the Rocket Girls by Nathalia Holt, a biologist and science writer. The \\"rocket girls\\" worked outside of the home when only 20 percent of women did so.

Fang went on to start AsianWeek, the first and largest English language newsweekly for the Asian American community, and the Fang Family became the first Asian Americans to own major American newspapers including the Independent Newspaper Group and The San Francisco Examiner. “Capitalizing on the fact that Chinatowns were becoming tourist attractions” across America, Fang's Chinatown Handy Guides took a unique approach of not only promoting Chinatowns as a tourist destination, but also as a place of interaction between Chinese Americans and white Americans. The San Francisco edition featured an “international group of businessmen and pastors” gathering for “bible class conducted each week in a local pharmacy.” The New York City edition included photos of Chinese children as part of a fundraising drive for the Red Cross, and another photo of “visiting Congressmen” being welcomed in Chinatown. Later academics described the books as “intended to boost (Chinatown’s) flagging tourist economy”, and as luring “sightseers with a predictable dim sum glossary, the origin story of chop suey, and a tutorial on how to hold chopsticks.” But the Chinatown Handy Guides also sought to characterize the development of the nation's Chinatowns as important contributors to America's economy. Each edition included a history of the specific Chinatown in that city, and quantified the economic contributions of the Chinese community, claiming for example, that in 1958 it was “safe to estimate that in Greater New York there (were) over 2,000 restaurants representing a total investment of over $100 million dollars, 500 stores, markets and curio shops and 5,000 laundries owned by Chinese.” Each guidebook also included “Points of Interest” and advertisements from local Chinatown establishments. The tourist booklets featured photos of many prominent Americans in Chinatown from President Richard Nixon to U.S. Congressmen and Senators. Republican Mayor George Christopher of San Francisco offered a welcome letter for the SF edition, while New York's Democratic Mayor Robert F. Wagner Jr. demonstrated how to use chopsticks in the NYC edition. Hollywood stars pictured visiting Chinatown ranged from Lucille Ball to Danny Kaye. The only African American pictured in Chinatown was Nat King Cole in San Francisco. History and distribution John T.C. Fang immigrated to the United States in 1952 and studied journalism at the University of California, Berkeley campus. Afterwards, he traveled to New York City where he published the first Chinatown Handy Guide in 1958. At the end of that year, Fang went to Chicago's Chinatown where the cold winter nearly prevented him from completing that city's edition. In 1959, Fang returned to the West Coast and published the San Francisco and Los Angeles editions of the Chinatown Handy Guide. After launching all four books, Fang returned to Taiwan as a successful publisher and entrepreneur, and married his wife Florence Fang, before the couple returned to America and John began working in the newspaper industry. Fang used a number of business, publishing and marketing techniques to promote Chinatown tourism. This included creating dual revenue streams – one from advertisements placed in the booklets by Chinatown restaurants and merchants, and another revenue stream from single copy sales as the booklets were sold for $1 each (including postage and handling for mail-in orders!) Fang also produced innovative marketing materials to promote the books. A 1960 brochure promoting the Chinese New Year Festival exhorted tourists to get “more enjoyment from your Chinatown visit” by purchasing a Chinatown Handy Guide, “available at Macy’s, White House (department store), Emporium, City of Paris, Woolworth’s and all leading department and book stores and Chinatown gift shops.” Orientalism and cultural impact The Chinatown Handy Guides were published at the height of the American Civil Rights Movement. With their focus on Chinese Americans however, the booklets promoted integration of Chinese in America rather than fighting against segregation practices that African Americans faced in southern states. Fang was a Chinese American who published his work during a time when \\"San Francisco entrepreneurs recognized the retail potential of the model family concept” to serve as “both a political defense mechanism and a means to strengthen (the Chinese community’s) economic muscle.” Facing eighty years of anti-Chinese policy since passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882, many Chinese leaders in the 1960s (including Fang) hoped to soften American attitudes by portraying the Chinese community as industrious, family-oriented and non-violent. As later researchers noted, “Chinese Americans came to rely on the trope of nondelinquency to advance their social-political ambitions—a tactic that enabled a reconciliation of claims to full citizenship with the replication of racial distinction.” The Chinatown Handy Guide prominently included features like “Chinatown’s Pride: No Juvenile Delinquency Problem,” “San Francisco Hail Chinese as Law-Abiding,” and “Mutual Love of Children and Elders Is the Basis of Chinese Family Life.” All editions of the book proudly proclaimed: “Chinatown is not concerned with finding a cure for juvenile delinquency. It has a preventive in its exemplary family life.” The 1960s also marked the beginning of the end for “the usage of ‘Oriental’ or ‘Orient’ as a catch-all phrase for Chinese and Japanese” people. Popularized at the beginning of the 20th Century in the 1900s, the term ‘Oriental’ had replaced the earlier use of ‘Mongol’ or ‘Mongoloid’ as descriptors for people of Asian descent. ‘Oriental’ was still the most accepted term for Asians in 1960 as the Chinatown Handy Guide proudly called Chinatown the “Oriental Colony” on its front cover, and repeatedly used the term ‘Oriental’ throughout its text. Later as founder of AsianWeek newspaper, Fang would play an important role in replacing the term ‘Oriental’ with ‘Asian’ as the accepted terminology for describing the pan- ethnic Asian Pacific Islander population which grew dramatically in the United States after passage of the 1965 Immigration Act. Even in his later years, Fang continued to be considered an expert on Chinatown and the Chinese community, commenting to The Christian Science Monitor in 1998 on how Chinese born in America were moving out of Chinatown into the suburbs. The Chinatown Handy Guide is catalogued at the Library of Congress and continues to be used as a historical resource both for its text and its photographs. The books have also become memorabilia, an original copy recently sold for $425 as a part of a batch of scarce Chinatown ephemera. Other publications John T.C. Fang's company, the Chinese Publishing House was an active publisher of books and directories focused on Chinatown and the Chinese community in America.

Early life  James William Foots was born in Jamieson, Victoria on 12 July 1916, the son of William Foots, who worked as an explosives expert in the Jamieson gold mines and his wife Ethel Allen. His mother died when he was three, and he and his brother were raised by their grandparents. He attended Coburg High school where he completed his studies as the Dux of the school. He won a scholarship to attend the University of Melbourne, but was compelled to complete another matriculation year, when it was felt he was too young to attend University. He graduated with a degree in Mining Engineering in 1937.  Career  Foots took up work at the Zinc Corporation mine in Broken Hill, and married Thora Thomas in 1939. During World War II, he and colleague, George Fisher worked on the creation of underground fuel storage tanks in Darwin during persistent bombing raids, before returning to work in Captain's Flat and Broken Hill in 1946. Foots moved to Mount Isa Mines, Queensland in 1952. He rose to the position of general manager of Mount Isa Mines Limited in 1955, succeeding George Fisher. Foots continued to lead the company later as chief executive and chairman of MIM Holidings Ltd, where he helped the group to expand metal production of lead, silver, copper and zinc. Foots was appointed to the Senate of The University of Queensland in 1970, and also held the position of Inaugural Chairman of The University of Queensland Foundation from 1982 to 1985. He was a governor of the foundation until 1992. He helped to establish the Julius Kruttschnitt Mineral Research Centre in 1970, in recognition of Kruttschnitt's work in Mt Isa and in helping to develop the Silver Mine acquired by the university in Indooroopilly. Foots was chancellor of The University of Queensland from 1985 to 1992. He was director of Uniquest from 1993 to 1997. He was a chairman of Westpac from 1987 to 1989. He was president of the Australian Mining Council and the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy in 1974. He was on the board of Castlemaine Toohey's Limited from 1983 to 1985, the National Mutual Life Association of Australasia Limited from 1982 to 1985 and ASARCO Incorporated 1985–1987. Foots died in Caloundra, Queensland on 21 August 2010. He was survived by his children and grandchildren. His wife Thora died in May 2010.  Legacy  Foots established a number of scholarships to support students in Mining Engineering, Chemical Engineering and Metallurgical Engineering. A building was also named in his honour at the St Lucia campus of The University of Queensland. A bridge in Mount Isa bears his name (2009).

A remake of the 1986 Kannada film Africadalli Sheela and inspired by the works featuring Sheena, Queen of the Jungle, the film stars Suresh, Sahila Chadha, Nizhalgal Ravi and Kanchana.  Plot  A doctor (Nizhalgal Ravi) goes deep into the dark continent of Africa with his wife to help tribals. The couple are killed before that can be done, and their daughter is raised by apes, growing up to be Sheela (Sahila Chadha). The doctor's father sends an expedition to search for his son. Unknown to him, the members of this expedition have other goals. How one of the expedition's members (Suresh) checkmates their moves and does the rescue forms the rest of the plot.  Production  Kizhakku Africavil Sheela is a remake of the 1986 Kannada film Africadalli Sheela, and was also inspired by the works featuring Sheena, Queen of the Jungle. The film was shot predominantly in Zimbabwe. Directed by Dwarakish, it was also produced by him under his banner Dwarakish Chitra. Sahila Chadha, who starred as the eponymous Sheela in Kannada, reprised her role in the remake.  Soundtrack  The soundtrack was composed by Bappi Lahiri.  Release and reception  Kizhakku Africavil Sheela was released on 14 January 1987. In a review dated 6 February 1987, The Indian Express felt the film largely resembled the \\"listless\\" television series Appu Aur Pappu as it was \\"stilted and trashy\\" like the dubbed Telugu action films that were common in that era. The reviewer criticised the characterisation of the villains, but praised the \\"catchy disco rhythms\\" composed by Bappi Lahiri, and Disco Shanti's \\"raw appeal\\".

Australia is a secular country with legislated separation of church and state and with no state religion. The nation has over 13.5 million people who identify asreligious and 7.1 million who identify as irreligious. Relevant legislation protecting religious freedoms include sections of the Constitution of Australia, Federal anti-discrimination laws and State/Territory-based human rights acts and anti-discrimination laws. As these freedoms are not protected in a single piece of legislation, but rather appear as sections, clauses and exemptions in other acts or laws, legal religious freedom protections are often a source of great debate and difficult to discern in Australia.  Religious freedom laws   Federal level  The Constitution of Australia prohibits the Commonwealth from establishing laws which create, force or prohibit any religion. It also restricts the Commonwealth from using religion as a qualifier or test in order to hold public office. Section 116 of Chapter V. The States in the Australian Constitution reads: > The Commonwealth shall not make any law for establishing any religion, or > for imposing any religious observance, or for prohibiting the free exercise > of any religion, and no religious test shall be required as a qualification > for any office or public trust under the Commonwealth. The section is based on the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. The article does not prohibit the states of Australia from implementing such laws, meaning legislation at the state level could provide for restriction or enforcement of religion.  State and territory level  Two referendums were held on whether to restrict the ability of states to legislate laws that may impede religious freedoms: the 1944 Australian Post-War Reconstruction and Democratic Rights referendum and 1988 Australian referendum. Both failed to achieve a majority of support amongst the states and therefore did not pass into law. In theory, Australian State and Territory Governments can therefore pass laws impeding religious freedoms. Some states and territories have implemented a bill or charter of rights which include freedom and protection for religion, such as Section 14: Freedom of thought, conscience, religion and belief in: * Human Rights Act 2004 (Australian Capital Territory) * Charter of Human Rights & Responsibilities Act 2006 (Victoria) These legislated acts are based on the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Australia was a signatory in 1966 despite no direct legislation to permit these freedoms. These acts do not prevent the passing of laws that impede any rights mentioned (including religious freedoms), but they do create a process by which all legislation must be scrutinised for human rights implications, and must be accompanied by a statement of compatibility with human rights before they can be passed by the relevant Parliament. In cases where the legislation is not compatible, it may still be passed despite contradicting these human rights acts.  Anti-discrimination laws  Anti-discrimination laws addressing unfair treatment on the basis of a range of attributes, including religion, also apply at the state and federal level. These laws contribute to religious freedoms by allowing Australians to practice religion without fear of consequence from the executive, organisations or individuals. This is achieved by prohibiting detrimental treatment as a result of an individual's religious appearance, beliefs or observances. Some argue these laws are inconsistent at the state level and may be limited at the federal level.  Federal level  The Australian Human Rights Commission Act 1986 defines discrimination as: > (a) any distinction, exclusion or preference made on the basis of race, > colour, sex, religion, political opinion, national extraction or social > origin that has the effect of nullifying or impairing equality of > opportunity or treatment in employment or occupation;  State and Territory level  State and Territory legislation prohibits unfavourable treatment on the basis of an individual's personal characteristics, but to varying degrees and with varying detail. Personal characteristics includes religious beliefs or activities in anti- discrimination legislation for the majority of states, and as such these laws may be seen to support religious freedom by prohibiting unfair treatment using religion as a basis. Further, anti-discrimination acts States where religious beliefs and activities are protected include: *Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (Western Australia) *Discrimination Act 1991 (Australian Capital Territory) *Anti-Discrimination Act 1991 (Queensland) *Anti-Discrimination Act 1996 (Northern Territory) *Anti-Discrimination Act 1998 (Tasmania) *Equal Opportunity Act 2010 (Victoria) Two other state acts apply narrower protection to 'religious appearance or dress' (Equal Opportunity Act 1984, South Australia) and 'Ethno-religious or national origin' (Anti-Discrimination Act 1977, New South Wales). It has been suggested that both states update their laws in order to align to the rest of the States and Territories.  Religious exemptions  General religious exception or exemption clauses exist within the various federal and state human rights acts with the aim to ensuring religious activities or observances are not impacted or inhibited by the protections provided by each act. These exemptions therefore protect freedom of religion by permitting what would otherwise be considered discrimination if it is in the context of \\"an act or practice of a body established for religious purposes that conforms to the doctrines, tenets or beliefs of that religion or is necessary to avoid injury to the religious sensitivities of adherents of that religion.\\" In the case of the Australian Human Rights Commission Act 1986, for example, an exemption is provided: > Discrimination ... does not include any distinction, exclusion or > preference: > (d) in connection with employment as a member of the staff of an institution > that is conducted in accordance with the doctrines, tenets, beliefs or > teachings of a particular religion or creed, being a distinction, exclusion > or preference made in good faith in order to avoid injury to the religious > susceptibilities of adherents of that religion or that creed. Varying groups have argued that existing religious exceptions and exemptions go too far and impede the rights of individuals, whilst others argue the correct balance has been struck, and yet others petition for wider-reaching religious exemption clauses.  Judgements and interpretations  Court 2 of the High Court of Australia, Canberra. The High Court has issued few judgements in direct relation to freedom of religion. There have been few tests involving religious freedom put before the High Court of Australia. Judgements from the Court are generally considered to interpret the primary piece of legislation relating to religious freedom, Section 116, narrowly. Church of the New Faith v Commissioner for Pay-Roll Tax (Vic) In the 1983 judgment of the High Court in Church of the New Faith v Commissioner for Pay-Roll Tax (Vic), the court was primarily concerned with whether Scientology was a religion (and therefore entitled to tax exempt status). In judgement, the Court found that Scientology was a religion and argued that the definition of religion must be flexible, but also remain sceptical of false claims. Justices Ronald Wilson and William Deane set out five \\"indicia\\" of a religion: > (i) That the collection of ideas and practices involved a belief in the > supernatural (being something that could not be perceived by the senses); > (ii) That 'the ideas relate to man's nature and place in the universe and > his relation to things supernatural' ; (iii) That the adherents accept > certain ideas as requiring them or encouraging them to observe particular > codes of conduct or specific practices having some supernatural > significance; (iv) The adherents themselves form an identifiable group or > groups; (v) The adherents themselves see the collection of ideas, beliefs > and practices as constituting a religion. In this judgement Section 116 was interpreted more broadly than in previous cases. The justices held that Section 116 provides fundamental guarantees to freedom of religion: > The development of the law towards complete religious liberty and religious > equality... would be subverted and the guarantees in s. 116 of the > Constitution would lose their character as a bastion of freedom if religion > were so defined as to exclude from its ambit minority religions out of the > main streams of religious thought. Adelaide Co of Jehovah's Witnesses Inc v Commonwealth In the 1941 the Commonwealth Government declared Jehovah's Witnesses to be a risk to national security, indicating they were believed to be \\"prejudicial to the defence of the Commonwealth\\" and the \\"efficient prosecution of the war\\" due to their following ideals of another Kingdom. Police occupied premises of the religious group, prompting a lawsuit heard by the High Court in which Jehovah's Witnesses argued their rights granted under Section 116 of the Constitution were infringed. The court held that the National Security (Subversive Organisations) Regulations 1940, under which the Government had taken action, did not infringe against Section 116, but that the government had exceeded their \\"defence power\\" in section 51(vi) of the Constitution. Jehovah's Witnesses have since continued to practice in Australia unabated.  Criticism and status quo  The absence of a Federal Bill of Rights (or Human Rights Act) which provide a guarantee of religious and other freedoms in almost all other western democracies, has been noted as a primary failure to solidify the current de facto and de jure rights to freedom of religion in Australia. The Australian Human Rights Commission has criticised the lack of protections for religious freedom alongside other de facto freedoms and has recommended the introduction of a Bill of Rights to formally protect the rights of people. Others have highlighted that religion and religious freedoms are already well- protected, including with exemptions to anti-discrimination legislation. Frequently highlighted examples include religious schools having rights not extended to other institutions, including the ability to fire teachers who do not align with the institution's religious beliefs for any reason. This occurred in the case of the Perth South Coast Baptist College and teacher Craig Campbell who was sacked for coming out as homosexual in 2017.  Ruddock Review  Philip Ruddock, chair of the Religious Freedom Review  Report commission  Following the passage of same-sex marriage legislation in Australia in 2017, a federal review was commissioned by the Turnbull Government to examine the suitability of current religious freedom protections, specifically within the context of the new Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Act 2017. The Religious Freedom Review was chaired by Philip Ruddock, the former Attorney-General for Australia at the time same-sex marriage was banned by the Howard Government in 2004, and had no associated terms of reference. The review panel was composed of Ruddock alongside Jesuit priest Frank Brennan, former judge Annabelle Bennett, Human Rights Commission president Ros Croucher and constitutional lawyer Nicholas Aroney. The expert review panel first met on 10 January 2018, and on 18 May the final review was handed to the Turnbull Government. The Government has declined to release the review in full pending cabinet discussion on its recommendations. The Ruddock review has been interpreted as a way to allow the speedy passage of Dean Smith's marriage bill and to postpone discussions of religious freedom. Proponents of the Ruddock Review argue it is necessary to ensure that religious freedoms are upheld in the wake of religious objection to same-sex marriage, whilst opponents highlight that further protections for religion are not necessary and will occur at the expense of an individual's right to be free from discrimination (particularly in the case of same-sex marriages). Groups such as the Victorian Aids Council and Australian Human Rights Commission have argued that a comprehensive Bill of Rights -rather than an exclusive religious freedoms law- should be implemented as this would also give full effect to Australia's obligations and commitments under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights by enshrining all fundamental rights.  Government response  Turnbull's government indicated it would not release the report received in May 2018 until it had been considered in full by the government. Following the deposition of Malcolm Turnbull as Prime Minister, his replacement Scott Morrison indicated his government would not release the report or form a full response to it before the end of 2018. This drew criticism from Michael Kirby and Kerryn Phelps given the timing of the Wentworth by-election, as voters would not have an understanding of any changes to religious law potentially instituted by Australia's first Pentecostal Prime Minister. Despite a senate motion ordering its release ahead of the by-election, the government refused to comply, claiming that a release would \\"harm the public interest\\" and interfere in cabinet consideration. The Prime Minister Scott Morrison suggested in an ABC Radio interview that the Ruddock review had recommended that people of different religions have the same protections as other attributes such as gender and race.  Leaks and media coverage  On 9 October 2018, extracts of the review were leaked to Fairfax Media, which reported that schools affiliated with a religion \\"would be guaranteed the right to turn away gay students and teachers under changes to federal anti-discrimination laws\\" recommended by the review. The Prime Minister initially defended this, but stated that the media coverage of the leaked report was \\"confused\\". Religious schools have held the right to discriminate against teachers and students on the basis of their gender or sexual orientation since 2013, however the Ruddock report recommended that schools additionally be required to hold a publicly available policy and put the best interests of the child first. Following further media coverage and public pressure, the Labor opposition announced their support would be lent to the government should it seek to repeal the discrimination law exemptions already in existence which allow religious schools to ban students based on their sexuality. The Morrison Government subsequently agreed to introduce a bill to parliament with that aim. The Australian Greens and Labor opposition have further committed to revoking discrimination exemptions that also allow discrimination against teachers based on their sexual orientation, however the government has so far not indicated its position. The full recommendations of the review were subsequently leaked to Fairfax and reported on 12 October 2018. It also must be noted that under common law, Freedom of Religion also means Freedom FROM Religion.

He was suffect consul in the nundinium of September-October 141; his colleague's name is not known.Werner Eck, \\"Die Fasti consulares der Regungszeit des Antoninus Pius, eine Bestandsaufnahme seit Géza Alföldys Konsulat und Senatorenstand\\" in Studia epigraphica in memoriam Géza Alföldy, hg. W. Eck, B. Feher, and P. Kovács (Bonn, 2013), p. 73 His full name is Titus Caesernius Statius Quinctius Statianus Memmius Macrinus. Statianus was the younger son of the procurator Titus Caesernius Statius Quinctius Macedo; the name of his older brother is Titus Caesernius Quinctianus, suffect consul in a nundinium around the year 138.Géza Alföldy, Konsulat und Senatorenstand unter der Antoninen (Bonn: Rudolf Habelt Verlag, 1977), p. 347 The Caesernii were a leading family of Aquileia.Alföldy, Konsulat und Senatorenstand, p. 303  Life  His cursus honorum up to his consulate is known from the dedication to a statue set up at Cirta in the imperial province of Numidia. The first office Statianus held was in the decemviri stlitibus judicandis, one of the four boards that formed the vigintiviri; membership in one of these four boards was a preliminary and required first step toward a gaining entry into the Roman Senate. Next he was comes Augusti in Oriente, or a companion of the emperor Hadrian during his tour of the eastern provinces around the year 129.Alföldy, Konsulat und Senatorenstand, pp. 350 His service near the emperor led to his service as quaestor as a candidate of the emperor, and upon completion of this traditional Republican magistracy Statianus would be enrolled in the Senate. He held the Republican magistracy of plebeian tribune, which was followed by the special assignment to recruit soldiers in Transpadane Italy (missus ad dilec[tu]m juniorum a Divo Hadriano in regionem Transpadanum). He then returned to Rome where he held the magistracy of praetor; Géza Alföldy dates his tenure as around the year 135. After he stepped down as praetor, Statianus was commissioned legatus or commander of Legio XIV Gemina, which at that time was stationed at Carnuntum in Pannonia Superior; Alföldy dates his service around the period from the year 136 to 138. Then he was appointed the emperor's legatus in Africa. This language reflects his actual role in North Africa: his appointment made him the commander of Legio III Augusta, which was stationed at Lambaesis, which although technically made him commander of another legion, this in fact made him governor of a stretch of Roman territory adjacent to the Roman province of Africa modern scholars refer to as Numidia. Alföldy dates his tenure in Roman Numidia from around the year 138 to 141, covering the date of Hadrian's death and the succession of Antoninus Pius.Alföldy, Konsulat und Senatorenstand, p. 247 During that time he became the patron of the cities of Cirta and Timgad, and it was at that time a statue was erected in his honor at Cirta. Since upon holding this post a senator most often immediately acceded to the consulate, as was the case with Statianus, he was likely admitted to the Roman priesthood of the sodales Augustales prior to being sent to command the III Augusta. Only one appointment for Statianus is known after his consulate: an inscription found at Pontailler-sur-Saone attests to his appointment as governor of Germania Superior; Alföldy dates his tenure from around 149 to 152.Alföldy, Konsulat und Senatorenstand, p. 228 How much longer Statianus lived after returning to Rome from Germania Superior is unknown. Alföldy dates his birth around the year 105, which would make him 47 when he left Germania Superior; based on what we know of Roman demographics, it is possible that Statianus lived about fifteen more years.

Originally started as the fourth generation Volkswagen Jetta in North America and the Volkswagen Bora in other parts of the world, it went through a few heavy facelifts, and production carried on with new updates long after the international Volkswagen Bora was out of production. __TOC__ First generation (1J; 2001) Volkswagen Bora I facelift rear The original Volkswagen Bora started out as a rebadged MK4 Jetta. The Bora in China received a facelift in the summer of 2006, with a Passat Mk5.5 lookalike face which is a rebadged City Jetta. The model available in Mexico, Canada, Brazil and Argentina from 2008 was likewise facelifted with the same design found in China. There is also a heavily modified Jetta called the Volkswagen Lavida for the Chinese market, developed by Shanghai Volkswagen on the same platform.  Bora HS  A hatchback version (i.e. the Golf) is also available after the facelift, and is badged as the Bora HS. Production began in 2006 and ended in 2008. Second generation (2007) The Bora received a complete makeover in 2007, being marketed as the New Bora, and from 2010, only as the Bora. This new model was developed by FAW-Volkswagen and is still being based on same platform as Golf IV, but using some components from the newer PQ35 platform. The Bora had a major facelift in December 2012, and a sportier and more premium trim level was created called the Volkswagen Bora Sportline. Third generation (2016) Volkswagen Bora III rear In March 2016 the model received another complete makeover featuring a completely redesigned exterior while continuing the platform, the engines, and the interior of the previous generation. Price for the Bora starts from 104,800 yuan to 149,800 yuan. This generation is still available as of May 2019 as the Bora Classic with three trim levels and pricing is between 106,800 and 116,800 yuan (15,440 to 16,890 USD). Volkswagen C-Trek The FAW- Volkswagen later launched a lifted wagon version of the updated Bora called the Volkswagen C-Trek. Fourth generation (2018) 2018 Volkswagen Bora rear In April 2018, FAW-Volkswagen revealed a new Volkswagen Bora sedan based on the MQB platform. The new model is similarly sized compared with the just revealed Volkswagen Lavida Plus which also stands on the MQB platform. The new Volkswagen Bora is available in the Chinese car market in September 2018 with prices starting from around 115,000 yuan.

Life  Johanna Maximiliana Großrubatscher was born at Neustift, a small village that had grown up around an Augustinian monastery just outside Brixen/Bressanone, about 40 kilometres (25 mi) north of Bolzano. Caspar Großrubatscher, her father, was a Pfleger (senior public administrator) originally from nearby Ladinia. She grew up in Merano where she was taught by the artists J. Kapeller and Makart, an uncle of the better remembered Vienna artist Hans Makart. By the time she was 21 Johanna Großrubatscher had already made a name for herself as a gifted and patriotic artist, producing meticulously detailed pictures of some of the many castles in the Burggrafenamt district surrounding Merano and the adjacent Vinschgau region. In 1823 the newly founded Innsbruck-based Association of Patriotic Museums (\\"Verein des vaterländischen Museums\\" / Ferdinandeum) commissioned her to produce \\"an accurate depiction\\" of the main gates at the Tyrol and Zenoburg Castles. In the Wars of Liberation (against Napoleon) Joseph Hormayr had chosen the main keep of the Tyrol Castle as the \\"National sanctuary\\" (\\"Heiligtum des Landes“ \\"). The images should be sufficiently detailed to be useful to students of medieval arts, and also to facilitate analysis and interpretation of old solutions to technical and construction challenges. In 1828 she married Johann Isser von Gaudententhurn. He was employed as a Landrichter (another form of government official). His work involved postings to a succession of district administrative centres in the southern part of the Tirol. The couple made their home successively in Riva (1828), Lavis (1831), Stenico (1832), Pergine (1834) and finally, in 1835, returning to Cavalese (where they had previously been posted briefly back in 1830). Johanna became the mother to seven recorded children. She also found time to continue with her art, producing drawings of castles across the Tirol, from the Inn valley to the north to the Lake Garda area in the south, also taking in neighbouring areas such as Liechtenstein, the Vorarlberg and parts of what has subsequently become known as Baden-Württemberg. In 1850, in connection with her husband's work, the family moved to Innsbruck, which is where they lived till Johann's death in 1863. Most of Johanna's pictures ended up in the collections of the Austrian National Library in Vienna and of the Tyrolean State Museum (Ferdinandeum) in Innsbruck. They are still regarded as important sources for research on castles in the area. They are valued for their attention to detail and are also helpful in \\"folklore research\\" since the artist frequently included small \\"genre scenes\\", generally showing working people, which provide contemporary context for the overall images. In particular, the images present the artistic mood of those times, characterized by a certain empathy with nature and a yearning for a return to (a romanticised vision of) the middle ages. One person who came across Johanna von Isser's collection of approximately 400 views of mountains and castles was the London artist- businessman Thomas Allom. He used her paintings as templates for paintings of his own and, in particular, for steel engravings. Prints from the steel engravings were published by Allom in Fleet Street, London, in a slim volume which also contained texts from Joseph Hormayr (1782-1848). As a result Johanna von Isser acquired an international reputation for her views of mountains and castles. As well as Thomas Allom, there were other English artists who used Johanna Großrubatscher's as templates. These included Samuel Lacey, T. Barbor, W. Taylor and H. Winkles. There were others who took Thomas Allom's derivative works as their templates. After her husband died some sources state that she relocated to Salzburg while others state that she moved in with the family of her daughter Alma who had married Hermann Reinhart von Thurnfels und Ferklehnen and lived at Varna di Bressanone. There is agreement that she later moved back to Innsbruck which is where she lived for some years until her death there.

A Terrible Vengeance () is a 2018 fantasy action horror mystery thriller film directed by Egor Baranov and starring Alexander Petrov in the title role. It is the third and the final film in the title trilogy. The film’s plot follows a resurrected Nikolai Gogol (as he died in the last movie) as he continues to try to find and stop the murderous and mysterious Dark Horseman, with the returning help of Inspector Yakov Petrovich Guro (Oleg Menshikov), only to stumble upon a shocking truth. https://echo.msk.ru/news/2268366-echo.html The film was released in Russia and worldwide on August 30, 2018 and has received positive reviews.Мистический триллер «Гоголь. Вий» выиграл праздничный уик-эндКассовые сборы в России и СНГ за уик-энд 5-8 апреля, 2018: «Гоголь. Вий» стартовал на 2 % лучше первой части Plot The series begins with cutting frames from Gogol's films. Start and Gogol. Viy: the Arrival of the Dark rider and killing the first victim of the Horseman, the conversation Yakov Petrovich Guro Gogol about the Rider, first acquaintance Guro Gogol, arrival in Dikan'ka and familiarity Yakov Petrovich and Guro with Binh, familiarity with Gogol Danishevsky, swinging on the swings at the Oak tree with Lisa, the first murder in Dikanka, the battle of Guro in a burning house with the Rider, opening the chest, Yakov Petrovich, ad special provisions in Dikanka, Vasilina meeting with the witch Uliana, output mavok from the pond, the battle with the Wii, the murder of women Rider, the fall of Gogol (lethargy). Chapter five. Rider's Lair Soon after Gogol’s death, Binh names him guilty for the deaths of the Cossacks and the young women at the hands of the Dark Horseman, since he was the one who ordered them to be hidden in the barn. Bomgart is unable to perform a post-mortem analysis on Gogol’s body, while Vakula’s daughter Vasilina (who secretly has magic abilities) proclaims denial about Gogol’s demise. Gogol’s body is buried at Dikanka’s graveyard, with Binh, Vakula, Bogmart, and Lisa presiding. Gogol awakens in the afterlife, where he meets his father and a noseless and bandaged man. The man tells Gogol \\"Live, Dark One.\\", resurrecting him. Gogol manages to get out of the coffin while the appalled crowd looks on. Gogol is soon arrested by Binh, who presumes him as the Dark Horseman, and locked up at the police headquarters. Yakim is also willingly locked up. He reveals to Gogol that the man who resurrected him was a man with ties to his family’s past; At the time of Gogol’s birth, his father was acquainted with the man. When Gogol’s mother gave birth to him, he was stillborn. However the man managed to resurrect the child, and the story was kept secret from Gogol. Meanwhile, Alexey meets Oksana (whom he is able to see) and offers her to keep Gogol away from Dikanka in exchange for bringing her back to life. Villagers suddenly attack the headquarters, subduing Binh, Yakim and Binh’s assistant. They attempt to burn Gogol at the stake, but Vasilina uses her abilities to create rain, saving Gogol. The villagers then try to hang Gogol, when their leader is suddenly shot in the leg. The shooter reveals himself to be Yakov Petrovich Guro, who survived the Dark Horseman’s attack as seen in the first chapter. He tells the mob to disperse, threatening them with execution and exile to Siberia, which they do. Guro reveals to Gogol that he has been manipulating the events after his presumed death in his attempt to find the real Dark Horseman. Gogol reveals that he suspects Alexei as the Horseman. As a result, Gogol, Guro, and Binh decide to search Alexei’s estate. At first, they are unable to find anything, but Gogol uses his visions to find the handle which opens a passage behind the fireplace. They go through the passage, discovering a cave. Inside they find Oksana with water gushing out of her mouth, a sign that she is being resurrected. Alexei suddenly appears, and Binh shoots him dead in the chest, surprising everyone as the Dark Horseman could not be taken down easily. Oksana suddenly comes to life, only to be killed seconds later by the Horseman, who absorbs her blood, creating a vortex. When the vortex recedes, the trio are appalled to see Lisa, revealing her to be the Dark Horseman. Chapter six. Terrible Vengeance The events of the present time and 163 years ago are shown in parallel. 163 years before the principal events of the film, the Cossack ataman is sent to repulse the Polish invaders led by sorcerer Kazimierz. Only one Cossack comes back from the whole army, saying that the Poles have broken them, the ataman was killed, and they will soon attack. The daughters of the ataman, Liza and Maria, turn to the sorceress-hermit, and she says that the Polish sorcerer can be defeated by wearing a tongued hoop: then Kazimir will lose his power and become mortal, but the price for his murder will be terrible. Nevertheless, Lisa and Maria, having crept into Casimir's tent, seize him and take him away to be surrendered. Along the way Kazimir says that his curse ends only when he loves someone, and asks Maria to let him go: if she answers him in return, he will be able to renounce witchcraft and become a man. Lisa decides to finish off the sorcerer on the spot, and enters with Maria in battle, until she falls, stumbling into the abyss. In anger, Liza beheads the Kazimir. However, his still living head tells her that she is now under the same curse and that every thirty years she needs to sacrifice twelve girls and one resurrected, not knowing death, until she falls in love herself. Maria is met in the next world by a fiery voice, telling her to go back: if she kills her sister, she can live, and until then she will wander in the guise of an old woman. In the present day, Guro fetters Lisa with the same conjured hoop, and during the interrogation confesses that he is not going to bring her to court: on the orders of the secret society, he must deliver the immortal Horseman to St. Petersburg so that he shares the secret of eternal life with the Russian Empire. In case of refusal, he threatens to kill Gogol. After listening to the conversation, Nikolai and Binh rush to stop Yakov Petrovich, and Binh, in order not to let him carry out his plans, shoots at Lisa. Hearing from her that Gogol himself was to be the thirteenth victim, but for his love Lisa spared him and instead killed Oksana - also resurrected - Gogol removes the bewitched hoop, and Liza again becomes an immortal Horseman. Hardly having coped with Guro, Liza, Gogol and Binh see on the threshold old woman Kristina from the village, which suddenly turns to Maria. She kills Binh and mortally wounds Gogol, and forces Liza to give her immortality to Nicholas, before decapitating her, like her sister did to Casimir. Vasilina, who sensed Gogol being in trouble, manages to save Gogol and Guro by distracting Maria long enough for Gogol to put the hoop around Maria's neck, making her mortal. Impressed, Guro offers membership in a secret society, since his mission was crowned with success, because the immortal is captured. After receiving a refusal, he returns to St. Petersburg. Gogol, along with Bogmart, Valkula and Binh's assistant, bury Binh at Dikanka's graveyard, promising to keep the events that happened here a secret, before departing. Gogol returns home, and inspired by Liza's praise of his work, begins to write a new novel based on his adventures. In St. Petersburg, Gogol presents his work, titled \\"Evenings on a Farm Near Dikanka\\" and receives a standing ovation. He then encounters a witch trying to kill him, but is saved by Pushkin and Lermontov. Having introduced themselves as members of a brotherhood which is at odds with Guro's society, they invite Gogol to join their ranks, and he agrees.

It lies in Milange District of Zambézia Province, 40 km SSW of the town of Milange. Mount Chiperone rises from the surrounding plains, 50 km south of the Mount Mulanje massif in southern Malawi. The plains to the north are part of the Central African Plateau, about 400–450 m altitude. The plains to the south are lower, 200–350 meters elevation, descending towards the Zambezi River. The valley of the Shire River, part of the African Rift Valley system, lies 35 km to the west.

Darwin Initiative Award 15/036: Monitoring and Managing Biodiversity Loss in South-east Africa's Montane Ecosystems. Accessed 22 June 2018. About 100 square kilometers of the mountain lie above 600 meters elevation, with around 4915 hectares above 800 meters elevation, 2770 ha above 1000 meters, and only 110 ha over 1800 meters. Flora The plant communities on Mt. Chiperone vary with elevation and exposure. Miombo woodland is predomiant below 1000 meters elevation. Most of the woodland below 800 meters elevation has been cleared for cultivation, with most of the remaining woodland on the northern and western slopes. Brachystegia spiciformis is the predominant tree in the woodland, forming a 10-15 meter high canopy. B. utilis is more common on drier ridges and shallower soils, forming an open canopy of 8-10 meters. Both species are dry- season deciduous, and canopy cover ranges from 80% to 20%, with a well- developed grass layer covering the ground underneath. Associated trees include Bridelia micrantha, Combretum molle, Pericopsis angolensis, Pterocarpus angolensis, Erythrina abyssinica, Cussionia arborea, Uapaca kirkiana, Uapaca nitida, Psorospermum febrifugum, Parinari excelsa, and Faurea saligna. Above 1000 meters elevation, the woodlands transition to medium-altitude forests. The main tree species are Newtonia buchananii, Strombosia scheffleri, Rinorea convallarioides, Chrysophyllum gorungosanum, and scattered large Khaya anthotheca. Albizia gummifera, Macaranga capensis, and Trema orientalis are found at the forest edges, and where the forest transitions to woodland. High- altitude forests are found above 1600 meters elevation.

Salvaged Treasures of Ancient Thrace Between 15 April and 21 June 2009, a large team from the Thrace Foundation and Russia's State Museum of Eastern Art presented an exhibition titled The Salvaged Treasures of Ancient Thrace in Moscow, which featured elements from the Vassil Bojkov Collection. The exhibition was part of The Year of Bulgaria in Russia initiative and was held under the patronage of Russia's and Bulgaria's Ministries of Culture. The Other Museum This exhibition was the first public event of the new Bulgarian Union of Private Collectors. The organisation was established in March 2010, with Professor Valeri Stefanov as its chair. Sofia's National Gallery of Foreign Art unveiled the exhibition on 7 June 2010. Art objects grouped into sections – archaeology, fine arts, numismatics, phaleristics, philately, weapons and their accessories, and ethnography – were gathered for the exhibition to show the special interests of private collectors. Thrace and the Ancient World This exhibition was opened at the National Museum of History on 21 March 2011. It was organised by the Thrace Foundation, the National Museum of History and the Bulgarian Union of Collectors, with Professor Ivan Marazov as its curator. More than 230 exhibits of ancient Thracian art were selected for the exhibition, the earliest of which were bronze weapons dating from the 2nd millennium BC. The most remarkable objects included silver rhytons with gilding and protomes of a lion, ram, horse, goat, snake and calf. They were made between the 5th and 6th century BC. Thracian Gold from Bulgaria. The Legends Come to Life This exhibition took place between 30 September and 30 November 2013 at the State Historical Museum in Moscow. It was a joint exhibition featuring historical treasures from ancient times of Bulgarian state and private museums: National Museum of History, Regional Archaeological Museum – Plovdiv, Regional Museum of History – Vratsa, Regional Museum of History – Ruse, Regional Museum of History – Lovech, Thrace Foundation with the private Vasil Bojkov Museum and the museum of the Arete-Fol Foundation. The Golden Fleece. The Path of the Argonauts This was the seventh exhibition of objects from the Vasil Bojkov Collection. It was held from 16 March 2018 to 10 June 2018 at the National Art Gallery (The Palace). The exhibition titled The Golden Fleece. The Path of the Argonauts Road featured 62 artefacts, 16 of which were shown to the general public for the very first time. The exhibition allowed visitors to follow in the footsteps of the Argonauts on their Fairy tale adventures. The exhibits transported the audience to ancient sacred places, such as Delphi and Samothrace, Thracian kingdoms, the lands of the legendary Amazons, the land of the sun Colchis and the holy island of Crete. Publishing Another key activity of the Thrace Foundation is the publication of scientific literature relating to the promotion and preservation of Bulgaria's cultural heritage. In 2004, the Thrace Foundation established a publishing house of the same name.

There are official organizations, such as Courage International, as well as stand-alone events, scholarly studies, comments, and teachings from the highest levels of the Catholic Church, as well as individual parish outreach. Vatican Pope John Paul II  During the pontificate of Pope John Paul II, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith issued a letter that asked \\"the bishops to support, with the means at their disposal, the development of appropriate forms of pastoral care for homosexual persons.” Benedict XVI, who as Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger was one of the signatories of the 1986 letter of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith on the Pastoral Care of Homosexuals This letter, addressed to all the bishops of the Catholic Church, was entitled On the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons. This was signed by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger as prefect. The letter gave instructions on how the clergy should deal with, and respond to, lesbian, gay, and bisexual people. Designed to remove any ambiguity about permissible tolerance of homosexual orientation resulting from the earlier Persona Humana—and prompted by the growing influence of gay-accepting groups and clergy—the letter was particularly aimed at the church in the United States.John L. Allen, Benedict XVI: A Biography, Continuum, 2005, p201 It affirmed the position that while homosexual orientation is not in itself a sin, it is nevertheless a tendency towards the \\"moral evil\\" of homosexual activity, and therefore must be considered \\"an objective disorder\\". The letter went on to say that when homosexual activity is the result of deliberate choice, it is not made inculpable by natural sexual orientation.Robert J. Dempsey, \\"The Catholic Church's Teaching about Same-Sex Marriage\\" in The Linacre Quarterly, vol 75 (2008), p. 77 Furthermore, the letter argues that this natural homosexual orientation is \\"essentially self-indulgent\\" since homosexual sexual acts are not procreative and therefore not genuinely loving or selfless. The letter condemned physical and verbal violence against gay people,Jeffrey Siker, Homosexuality and Religion but asserted that condemnation of violence did not mean that the homosexual orientation was good or neutral or that homosexual sexual acts should be permitted. However, it added that human beings, being made in the image and likeness of God, could not be reduced to either heterosexuals or homosexuals. Instead, it affirmed that every person, gay or straight, \\"has a fundamental identity: a creature of God, and by grace, his child and heir to eternal life.\\" The letter also said that accepting homosexual acts as morally equivalent to married heterosexual acts was harmful to the family and society and warned bishops to be on guard against, and not to support, Catholic organizations not upholding the Church's doctrine on homosexuality—groups which the letter said were not really Catholic.Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, Letter on the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons, 1 October 1986 This alluded to LGBT and LGBT-accepting Catholic groups such as DignityUSA and New Ways Ministry, and ultimately resulted in the exclusion of Dignity from Church property. Critics have described the document as teaching \\"that a gay male or lesbian sexual identity is not to be celebrated, nor is it properly seen as a source of pride\\". The claims that accepting and legalizing homosexual behaviour leads to violence were seen as controversially blaming gay people for homophobic violence and encouraging homophobic violence.McNeill, The Church and the Homosexual, 4th ed, p154 Referring to the AIDS epidemic, the letter, McNeill writes, blamed AIDS on gay rights activists and gay-accepting mental health professionals: \\"Even when the practice of homosexuality may seriously threaten the lives and well-being of a large number of people, its advocates remain undeterred and refuse to consider the magnitude of the risks involved\\".\\"Some Considerations Concerning the Catholic Response to Legislative Proposals on the Non-Discrimination of Homosexual Persons\\", Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. July 1992. Andrew Sullivan called this comment \\"extraordinary for its lack of compassion\\"John L. Allen 2005, p. 202 and added that \\"some of [the letter's] clauses read chillingly like comparable church documents produced in Europe in the 1930s.\\"John L. Allen 2005, p. 203 In a statement released in July 1992, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith expanded on the letter and stated that discrimination against gay people in certain areas, such as selecting adoptive or foster parents or in hiring teachers, coaches, or military service members, is not unjust, and thus permitted. Pope Francis In an interview on 28 July 2013, when discussing homosexuals (both in general and their place in the clergy) and answering a question as to whether there was a \\"gay lobby\\" in the Vatican, the pontiff said, \\"If someone is gay and is searching for the Lord and has good will, then who am I to judge him? The Catechism of the Catholic Church explains this in a beautiful way, saying...: 'no one should marginalize these people for this, they must be integrated into society.'\\" According to two gay rights activists, Marcelo Márquez and Andrés Albertsen, Bergoglio expressed support for the spiritual needs of \\"homosexual people\\" and willingness to support \\"measured actions\\" on their behalf in private conversations with them. These remarks have been seen as an encouraging change of tone from the papacy, so much so that the American LGBT magazine The Advocate named Pope Francis their Person of the Year for 2013. On 2 October 2016, Pope Francis spoke in favor of pastoral care for and including transgender Catholics in the church, stating priests should \\"accompany them spiritually\\" and that they should never be turned away, even if they have undergone gender transition and sex-reassignment operations. Francis once held an audience with a Spanish transgender man, who had transitioned from female to male, and his wife. In April 2018 Pope Francis met with Juan Carlos Cruz, a survivor of sexual abuse by Chilean priest Fernando Karadima. Cruz discussed with Francis in detail how his sexual orientation was used by Latin American media and news outlets to discredit his report of abuse and label him as a pervert and liar. In a private conversation between the two, Francis reportedly said to Cruz, who identifies as gay, in regards to his sexuality, \\"You know Juan Carlos, that does not matter. God made you like this. God loves you like this. The Pope loves you like this and you should love yourself and not worry about what people say.\\" On 26 August 2018, while in Ireland, Pope Francis said that homosexual people existed in the whole history of humankind. He also said Catholic parents should talk with their homosexual children and that they shouldn't \\"thrown out\\" of the family. In a press statement the following day, he declared that homosexuality is not an illness. 2014 Synod on the Family At the 2014 Synod on the Family, the interim report asked if the Church was capable of guaranteeing gay Catholics \\"a place of fellowship in our communities\\" and \\"accepting and valuing their sexual orientation, without compromising Catholic doctrine on the family and matrimony.\\" It added that gay people have \\"gifts and qualities to offer the Christian community.\\" Cardinal Donald Wuerl argued that it was \\"not so much a change in the teaching of the Church, but a way of saying it that is far more inviting, far more welcoming.\\" The final report speaks of the giving of appropriate pastoral care, in harmony with the Church's teaching, to LGBT Catholics and that gay people \\"ought to be received with respect and sensitivity.\\" After the vote, Archbishop Paul-André Durocher wrote on his blog that \\"I have the impression many would have preferred a more open, positive language. Not finding it in this paragraph, they might have chosen to indicate their disapproval of it.\\" Cardinal Vincent Nichols said he did not think it a good paragraph, because the absence of the key words \\"respect\\", \\"welcome\\", and \\"value\\" meant it did not go far enough. He gave assurance that there was no question in the synod of endorsing the idea of same-sex marriage or of changing the Church's teaching on sexual morality. Other bishops worried that more welcoming language \\"could be read as code- words for the Catholic Church going soft on its moral teaching.\\" The interim report's statements on homosexuality were described by gay rights advocates as \\"a seismic shift in tone toward acceptance of gays.\\" One priest commentator said that the language used \\"represents a revolutionary change in how the church addresses the LGBT community,\\" pointing to the document's lack of use of phrases such as \\"intrinsically disordered.\\" The attitude change on homosexuality signaled by the interim report was welcomed by gay groups such as DignityUSA, who said that the \\"positive language\\" used \\"is more affirming and will give many people hope.\\" 2015 Synod on the Family At the larger followup Synod on the Family in 2015, Courage International and Ignatius Press sponsored an event at the Angelicum on homosexuality that featured Cardinals Robert Sarah and George Pell. The Global Network of Rainbow Catholics also held an event that they said hoped would bring \\"LGBT voices to the Synod\\" at the Centre for Pilgrims Santa Teresa Couderc. During the Synod debates, the rejection of \\"exclusionary language\\" towards gays was a topic of discussion. One Synod member, who was not publicly identified, said that gay Catholics \\"are our children. They are family members. They are not outsiders. They are our flesh and blood. How do we speak about them [positively] and offer a hand of welcome?\\" According to Archbishop Mark Coleridge of Australia, there was strong support in the early days of the assembly for using a \\"less condemnatory approach,\\" especially regarding language, when pastorally caring for and speaking about gay Catholics, on the order of 70% in favor and 30% opposed. Archbishop Charles Chaput of the United States echoed this thought in an interview, saying that the phrase \\"intrinsically disordered\\" turns people off and \\"probably isn’t useful anymore.\\" While making clear that any new language adopted should make clear the Church's teaching, he said that this particular phrase should be put \\"on the shelf for a while, until we get over the negativity related to it.\\" Irish Archbishop Diarmuid Martin also told the assembly that the successful campaign in his country to legalize gay marriage used \\"what was traditionally our language: equality, compassion, respect and tolerance.\\" The final report repeated Church teaching that every person, gay or straight, should be treated with dignity and not face unjust discrimination, but also reaffirmed that marriage was between a man and a woman. It did not describe how the Church should minister directly to them, but did say that there should be outreach. 2018 Synod on Youth The 2018 Synod of Bishops is focused on youth and the issues facing them. Among other topics, the concerns of LGBT youth will be discussed. In responses to surveys distributed by the Church, many LBGT youth said they wish to \\"‘benefit from a greater closeness’ and experience greater care from the Church.\\" As such, the concerns of gay youth \\"who, above all, want to remain close to the Church,\\" will be a special concern. The preparatory working document also insisted that the Church must be open and welcoming to all, including LGBT Catholics, those of other faiths, and those of no faith at all. Secretary General Lorenzo Baldisseri said at the release of the working document that the Church is making a special effort to engage the LGBT community because \\"we are open. We don't want to be closed in on ourselves.\\" The Synod will also discuss the challenges the Church sometimes has in explaining the Church's teaching on sexuality to contemporary society. Saying that \\"No bishops’ conference offers solutions or recipes,” the document insists that \\"the question of sexuality must be discussed more openly and without prejudice.\\" The preparatory working document for the synod used the acronym LGBT, the first time it had been used in an official Vatican document. It stated that “some LGBT youth” wanted to “benefit from greater closeness and experience greater care by the church.” Pontifical Biblical Commission In December 2019, the Pontifical Biblical Commission published a book length document, \\"What is Man? An Itinerary of Biblical Anthropology,\\" that includes a nine page discussion of homosexuality. It calls on the church to provide more pastoral care for LGBT Catholics in order \\"to implement that service of good that the Church must assume in its mission on behalf of mankind.\\" United States United States Conference of Catholic Bishops The National Conference of Bishops met with DignityUSA in 1975. At a 1976 conference on social justice, five of the Conference's recommendations promoted pastoral care for LGBT people and opposed discrimination against them. In the same year, the Conference wrote to American Catholics that gay men and women \\"should have an active role in the Christian community.\\" The bishops added that \\"the Christian community should provide [LGBT people] a special degree of pastoral understanding and care.\\" =Human Sexuality: A Catholic Perspective for Education and Lifelong Learning= The US bishops called on \\"all Christians and citizens of good will\\" in 1991 \\"to confront their own fears about homosexuality and to curb the humor and discrimination that offend homosexual persons. We understand that having a homosexual orientation brings with it enough anxiety, pain and issues related to self-acceptance without society bringing additional prejudicial treatment.\\"Human Sexuality: A Catholic Perspective for Education and Lifelong Learning, 1991, p. 55 =Always Our Children= The bishops of the United States published in 1997 a letter entitled Always Our Children, as a pastoral message to parents of gay and bisexual children with guidelines for pastoral ministers. It told parents not to break off contact with a gay or bisexual son or daughter; they should instead look for appropriate counseling both for the child and for themselves. The letter said that, while homosexual orientation is not sinful, homosexual activity is immoral, but gay people must be accepted with respect, compassion, and sensitivity, and allowed to participate actively in the Christian community, and even, if living chastely, to hold leadership positions. One of the pastoral recommendations it made to church ministers was \\"Welcome homosexual persons into the faith community, and seek out those on the margins. Avoid stereotyping and condemning. Strive first to listen. Do not presume that all homosexual persons are sexually active. Learn more about homosexuality and church teaching so your preaching, teaching, and counseling will be informed and effective.\\" It added that \\"it is not sufficient only to avoid unjust discrimination. Homosexual persons 'must be accepted with respect, compassion and sensitivity.'\\" It also noted \\"an importance and urgency\\" to minister to those with AIDS, especially considering the impact it had on the gay community, and the bishops \\"reject[ed] the idea that HIV/AIDS is a direct punishment from God.\\" They closed by saying that \\"nothing in the Bible or in Catholic teaching can be used to justify prejudicial or discriminatory attitudes and behaviors.\\" =Guidelines for Pastoral Care= The 2006 Guidelines for Pastoral Care issued by the Bishops' Conference said it was \\"sad to say\\" that many LGBT Catholics felt unwelcome, rejected, and alienated from the Church. The document called for \\"outreach programs and evangelization efforts... to be mindful of such persons,\\" and said that a \\"welcoming stance of Christian love by the leadership and the community as a whole is essential for this important work.\\" It also says: \\"It is deplorable that homosexual persons have been and are the object of violent malice in speech or in action. Such treatment deserves condemnation from the Church’s pastors wherever it occurs.\\" Diocesan efforts =Ministries= Bishop Walter Sullivan established the first diocesan pastoral outreach program to LBGT Catholics in the US, the Sexual Minorities Commission, in 1976. Also that year, Bishop Francis Mugavero called for the church to provide greater \\"pastoral understanding and care\\" for LGBT people. The Diocese of Trenton established a position to reach out to sexual minorities in 1979. The National Association of Catholic Diocesan Lesbian and Gay Ministries (later the Catholic Association for Lesbian and Gay Ministry) was established in 1995. By 1997 it represented over 30 dioceses from around the United States and had an executive director. As of 2012, it had more than 200 caregivers in 25 states and an office in Berkeley, California. The Diocese of San Jose in California has a Catholic LGBT Ministry Council. Along other things, it hosts a monthly \\"All Are Welcome\\" Mass at a rotating parish throughout the diocese. The Archdiocese of Los Angeles has a Catholic Ministry with Lesbian and Gay Persons that was established in 1986, shortly after Roger Mahony was established as archbishop. The Archdiocese of Seattle established a ministry in 1988. By 1990, there were also official ministries in St. Augustine and Los Angeles. By 2001, ministries in the Diocese of Cleveland, the Archdiocese of Cincinnati, Diocese of Orlando, the Diocese of Charlotte, and the Diocese of Rochester were established. Joseph Michael Sullivan, auxiliary bishop of the Diocese of Brooklyn and chairman of the Social Development and World Peace Department of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, commissioned a docudrama of the lives of LGBT clerics and laity. Full of Grace was performed to coincide with the first visit of Pope Francis to Philadelphia in 2015. Charles J. Chaput, the archbishop of Philadelphia, had given instructions that no LGBT-related event could take place at a Catholic building during the Pope's visit to the World Meeting of Families and had several Catholic groups evicted from Catholic premises. As a result, Full of Grace, a Catholic docudrama, was performed at a Protestant church—Philadelphia's historic Christ Church—days before the Pope arrived. =Masses, synods, and pilgrimages= At a 1997 Mass for LGBT Catholics and their families at the Cathedral of the Sacred Heart in Richmond, Virginia, Bishop Walter Sullivan opened the liturgy by saying, “You belong here. It’s about time somebody says that to you.” Robert W. McElroy, the Bishop of San Diego, held a diocesan synod on the family in October 2016 that called for improved ministry toward gay and lesbian Catholics. “Our belief is that all people who are gay or lesbian or transsexual or bisexual, all those who face issues of sexuality, they are all members of our family and the family of God,” McElroy said. The summer before, the diocese invited the local chapter of DignityUSA to attend \\"Catholic Night\\" at a San Diego Padres game. In June 2017, Cardinal Joseph Tobin, Archbishop of Newark in the USA, held a \\"Pilgrimage\\" Mass specifically for LGBT Catholics from around New York and the five dioceses in New Jersey at the Cathedral Basilica of the Sacred Heart. Many of the attendees were married to same-sex spouses, and participated in the Sacrament of Holy Communion. It was reported, however, that Tobin subsequently received hate-mail from Catholics opposed to the move. The director of New Ways Ministry indicated that this was a positive first step, contrasting with a church leadership that has for decades \\"been so silent, and unwilling to dialogue, and unwilling to pray with L.G.B.T. Catholics\\". The event was organized by gay ministries within the Church of the Sacred Heart in South Plainfield, New Jersey, and the Church of the Precious Blood in Monmouth Beach. =Writings= Bishop Thomas V. Daily issued a pastoral letter in 1993 in which he said: \\"It is evident that the pastoral care of our homosexual brothers and sisters is increasingly becoming a matter of urgency in our society.\\" Daily wrote that \\"The homosexual person, striving to live a chaste life, is no different than any other human person and is to be afforded the same respect, Christian love and dignity.\\" He added that \\"It is deplorable when homosexual persons are the object of malice in speech or in action or when they are deprived of their basic human rights. Prejudice and discrimination against homosexual persons are not only uncharitable, they are unjust.\\" Calling on the Church to do more, Bishop Walter Sullivan wrote in 1983 that > “we cannot remain satisfied that, once we have clearly articulated the > official Church position on homosexuality, nothing else remains to be done > in the area of pastoral care for homosexual people and education on this > topic for the larger human community, including the families and friends of > homosexual people. This is especially true in those cases where the teaching > of the Church itself has been presented in such a way that it has been the > source or occasion of some of the pain and alienation that many homosexual > Catholics experience. We cannot overlook those injustices, including > rejection, hostility, or indifference on the part of Christians, that have > resulted in a denial of respect or of full participation in the community > for homosexual people. We must examine our own hearts and consciences and > know that each of us stands in need of real conversion in this area.\\" =Comments= During Lent in the Great Jubilee of 2000, Cardinal Roger Mahony apologized to those that he or the Roman Catholic Church may have offended, including: “I ask pardon of our Catholic homosexual and lesbian members when the church has appeared to be non-supportive of their struggles or of falling into homophobia.” Cardinal Blase Cupich of Chicago has also suggested that the Catholic Church should respect and use words such as \\"gay\\" and \\"lesbian\\" as a way of more effectively reaching out to the LGBT community. Clergy and Religious The National Federation of Priests' Councils adopted a platform supporting the \\"civil rights of homosexual persons\\" in 1974. The National Coalition of American Nuns adopted a similar stance the same year. In 2018, the Association of U.S. Catholic Priests adopted a resolution calling for the church to adopt more welcoming language when speaking about LGBT people, and for church-wide ministries for them and their families. England and Wales The Catholic Bishops of England & Wales issued \\"An Introduction to the Pastoral Care of Homosexual People\\" in 1979. It repeated Catholic teaching that sexual activity was only licit within a marriage and that both homosexual and heterosexual orientations are morally neutral. The Introduction stated that all Catholics, including LGBT Catholics, have equal rights to the sacraments and it strongly denounced prejudice and discrimination: \\"As a group that has suffered more than its share of oppression and contempt, the homosexual community has a particular claim upon the concern of the church.\\" It added: \\"Homosexuals have a right to enlightened and effective pastoral care with pastoral ministers who are properly trained to meet their pastoral needs.\\" After the 1999 London nail bombings that targeted London's LGBT population, special Masses were held that specifically welcomed lesbian and gay Catholics, their parents, and families. It resulted in a vibrant community being formed with new converts to Catholicism, and it attracted the attention and support of Cardinal Cormac Murphy O'Connor. In 2007, a special ministry for LGBT Catholics, particularly those in Soho and Piccadilly, was established. In the early 21st century, the Church of Our Lady of the Assumption and St Gregory in Soho hosted \\"one of the most successful LGBT Catholic parishes in the world\\". For six years, these \\"Soho Masses\\" offered twice-monthly services \\"particularly welcoming to lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgendered Catholics, their parents, friends and families\\". In 2013, under pressure from the Vatican, they were forced to move to Church of the Immaculate Conception, Farm Street, in nearby Mayfair; Archbishop Vincent Nichols attended their first Mass there in 2013. Cardinal Basil Hume stated that \\"Homophobia should have no place among Catholics. Catholic teaching on homosexuality is not founded on, and can never be used to justify homophobic attitudes.\\" He has also said: \\"In upholding the dignity of people who are homosexual the Church is being consistent to its teaching.\\" Hume also taught that, in addition to prayer and the sacraments, pastoral care for LGBT Catholics should include \\"a respectful attitude and a sympathetic understanding.\\" Elsewhere In Germany, Cardinal Reinhard Marx, president of the German Bishops’ Conference, called on German priests to provide better pastoral care for gay Catholics. Bishop Charles Scicluna of Malta attended a May 2014 event organised by the Maltese Catholic gay rights group Drachma to mark International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia. In Ireland, Archbishop Diarmuid Martin of Dublin reacted to concerns over anti- gay comments in the media by saying that \\"anybody who doesn't show love towards gay and lesbian people is insulting God. They are not just homophobic if they do that — they are actually Godophobic because God loves every one of those people.\\" In April 2016, the Bishop of Lexington in Kentucky, John Stowe, spoke at a New Ways Ministry national conference and indicated that he admired and respected LGBT people who remained steadfast to the church even though the church had not always been as welcoming.New Ways Ministry, \\"Bishop Stowe brings message of admiration and respect\\", May 22, 2017 – https://www.newwaysministry.org/2017/05/22/symposium-bishop-stowe-brings- message-of-admiration-and-respect/ Italian Archbishop Matteo Zuppi has said that Church teachings on sexual ethics \\"have not been followed up with a commensurate pastoral program—one that doesn’t simply restrict itself to the cold application of doctrinal guidelines, but instead transforms them into a journey of accompaniment.\\" Organizations Courage International In response to the push within the United States for greater recognition within the Church for gay men and lesbian women, Cardinal Terence Cooke of New York City invited John Harvey to establish a ministry that would reach-out and minister to gay Catholics to help them \\"live chaste lives in fellowship, truth, and love.\\" Initially Harvey worked with Benedict Groeschel of the Franciscan Friars of the Renewal to establish Courage International in 1979. The first meeting was held in September 1980 at the Shrine of Mother Seton in South Ferry, and chapters were subsequently established in a small number of other countries (Canada, Australia and 11 Latin American and European countries). Up until the 1990s the organisation was an active supporter of conversion therapy, believing gay people could be turned \\"straight.\\" The organization no longer supports conversion therapy. The group generally consists of laymen and laywomen usually under anonymous discretion, together with a priest, to encourage its members to abstain from acting on their sexual desires and to live chastely according to the Catholic Church's teachings on homosexuality.\\" Its annual conference in the US usually attracts around 350 delegates. The organisation has been criticised by Catholic gay groups such as New Ways Ministry who argue that outreach and welcoming needs to also extend to those who do have sexual relationships. Critics have also complained that Courage is effectively promoting is \\"mandatory celibacy for gays and lesbians.”Patricia Montemurri, 6 March 2014, \\"Detroit Archdiocese to encourage gay Catholics to be chaste in Courage sessions\\", Detroit Free Press:https://web.archive.org/web/20150715031454/http://archive.freep.com/article/20140306/NEWS06/303060114/Chaste- Gay-Catholic-Courage-Group-Archdiocese-of-Detroit Global Network of Rainbow Catholics The Global Network of Rainbow Catholics, an organization of 13 different groups ministering to LGBT Catholics, met for the first time at the 2014 Synod on the Family. They held an event in Rome titled \\"LGBT Voices to the Synod\\" at the 2015 Synod on the family. At the close of the Synod they said that they were hopeful and felt it was the \\"beginning of a new era of inclusive pastoral care for and with LGBT people and their families.\\" In their statement the network said that while they had hoped the Synod would go further, they appreciated the “expressions of apology” for what it termed “harmful and inaccurate language” sometimes used when discussing gay people. New Ways Ministry New Ways Ministry was founded in 1977 by Sister Jeannine Gramick and Father Robert Nugent after Bishop Francis Mugavero called on Catholics to reach out in “new ways” to lesbian and gay Catholics. Publications Building a Bridge In 2017, Rev. James Martin, a Jesuit priest in the US, published Building a Bridge: How the Catholic Church and the L.G.B.T. Community Can Enter Into a Relationship of Respect, Compassion and Sensitivity. In the book, Martin outlines several ways each side can treat the other more charitably: for example, calling on church leaders to use terms like \\"gay\\" and \\"L.G.B.T.\\", instead of phrases like \\"afflicted with same-sex attraction\\". The preface to the Italian version of the book was written by Archbishop Matteo Zuppi of Bologna. The book has also been translated into Dutch, French, and German. Martin also argued that to expect a sinless lifestyle from gay Catholics, but not from any other group, is a form of \\"unjust discrimination\\" and that gay people should not be fired for marrying a same-sex spouse. Cardinal Joseph Tobin and Cardinal Kevin Farrell contributed blurbs to the book. However, a number of Catholic institutes, including Theological College in Washington, The Order of the Holy Sepulchre in New York, and Cafod in the UK subsequently cancelled events at which Martin was due to speak, after pressure from conservative Catholics who threatened to withhold funding. Robert McElroy, the Bishop of San Diego, rallied to support Martin and criticized those who had tried to vilify him and distort his writings. Nevertheless, Martin was subsequently invited to give a keynote address at the Vatican-sponsored World Meeting of Families held in Dublin in summer 2018.New York Times, John Gehring, \\"Can the Catholic church evolve on LGBT rights\\", 5 July 2017 – https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/05/opinion/pope- francis-catholic-church-lgbt.html Marianist Social Justice Collaborative The Marianist Social Justice Collaborative publishes \\"Addressing LGBT Issues: A Resource for Educators.\\" It states that, \\"As members of the Marianist Family, who are part of the larger Body of Christ, we are called to attentiveness and concern for the growth, protection and well-being of all those entrusted to our care, including those in our classrooms who are gay, lesbian or still coming to understand their sexuality.\\" The guide \\"offers a Catholic rationale, perspective and orientation for addressing these issues and ministering among lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) youth,\\" including living up to \\"our responsibility to combat bullying and to bring understanding, respect and acceptance to all students.\\" It adds: \\"Supporting LGBT students does not condone sexual activity any more than supporting heterosexual students condones sexual activity.

Inspired by apocalyptic stories of the decline of Buddhism, in about 609 CE he conceived a project to carve Buddhist sutras onto stone tablets or steles to preserve them.Ledderose 2004, Lee 2010 . The project began ca. 611 with major donations from the Empress and her brother Xiao Yu in 611 CE.Tsukamoto Zneryū cited in Lee 2010: 46-7 Other donations soon followed and Leiyin Cave was completed ca 616 CE. Once begun, the project was to continue, off and on, for 1000 years and produced the most extensive collection of sutra engravings in China. Jingwan lived in a tumultuous period of Chinese history. He lived through the persecution of Buddhism during the Northern Zhou dynastyYong and Yongyou 2010: 138. The Sui Dynasty finally reunited China as one empire after almost two centuries of division, but then rapidly seemed to lose control. A series of failed military campaigns against Korea, by Emperor Yang led to widespread rebellion and the eventual assassination of the Sui Emperor in 618. The Tang Dynasty quickly replaced the Sui, but it took some years to impose order on the empire, and thus for much of Jingwan's career there was social and political turmoil, which seems to have fuelled his apocalyptic tendencies. Jingwan left notes on his progress and in them also a moving account of his belief that the world was falling into a dark period in which Buddhism would disappear completely. Like Christian millennialists, Buddhist eschatology had long predicted the end of the world, although in Buddhist terms this was a cyclic phenomena, occurring in three ages. Jingwan had used scriptural references to determine that he was living in the age of the End of the Dharma (末法 Mòfǎ), in which the Buddha's teachings would completely disappear. Indeed he estimated that the dark age had begun in 553.Ledderose 393 Unlike Christian eschatology, after a long period of no Buddhism, the Dharma would be re-established by the next Buddha Maitreya. The 17th Century travelogue, 帝京景物略 (pinyin: Dìjīng jǐngwù è) by Liu Tong, links Jìngwǎn to the Tiantai monk and noted prophet of the decline of Buddhism, Huìsī, however there are no surviving earlier references to this association.Ledderose 2004: 393 Stone Sutras Phase One Jingwan's initial effort was create the Leiyin or Thunder Sound Cave and line the walls with Buddhist sutras, primarily the Saddharmapuṇḍarikā-sūtra, the Vimalakīrti-nirdeśa, and the Prajñāpāramitā-vajracchedikā, along with extracts from a variety of other texts.Lee 2010: 46 The cave was probably developed from a natural opening in the cliff face in a ridge now called Shijingshan or Stone Sutra Mountain, one of a complex of peaks in the Fangshan complex. In all 19 texts, engraved on 147 stone slabs were set into the walls of the cave in two or three registers.Ledderose 2004: 385 Leiyin cave seems to have intended to be an open shrine where people could come in and read (and likely worship) the sutras.Lee 2010: 44 Phase Two Having completed the Leiyin Cave, Jingwan began to expand, eventually creating a total of nine caves. However, in these subsequent caves the stone slabs were not installed on the walls, but densely stacked. Once a cave was full, it was sealed with a heavy stone door. Jingwan had expressed his wish that the collections not be disturbed unnecessarily.Ledderose 400. Lothar Ledderose has characterised this change as \\"changing the audience\\" and has suggested that it was a gradual transition. In phase one, the sutras in Leiyin Cave were meant to be read by living people. With the subsequent caves the audience was imagined to be people in the future.Ledderose 2004: 390 ff.

It has a single erect, channelled, linear leaf and up to four deep blue flowers. It is similar to T. pauciflora but is distinguished from that species by its slaty grey flower buds and a different lobe on top of the anther. Description Thelymitra odora is a tuberous, perennial herb with a single erect, non-fleshy, channelled, linear leaf long and about wide with a purplish base. Up to four deep blue flowers wide are borne on a flowering stem tall. The flower buds are a slaty grey colour. The sepals and petals are long and wide. The column is white or pale blue, long and wide. The lobe on the top of the anther is tube-shaped and dark coloured with a yellow, slightly notched tip. The side lobes curve sharply upwards and have mop-like tufts of white hairs on their ends. The flowers open on warm, humid days. Flowering occurs between late October and early-November. Taxonomy and naming Thelymitra odora was first formally described in 2010 by Robert Bates from a specimen he collected near Lobethal in 2007. The description was published in the Journal of the Adelaide Botanic Garden. The specific epithet (odora) is a Latin word meaning \\"having a smell\\" or \\"fragrant\\", referring to fact that this is one of the few thelymitra to have a fragrance. Distribution and habitat This thelymitra is only known from the southern Mount Lofty Ranges where it grows in seepage areas and on the edges of firebreaks.

It is first recorded in the 1811 in Hammer's die deutschen Kartenspiele and is still played as a family game in parts of German-speaking Europe. It is a member of the trick avoidance group of playing cards.

Suit must be followed if possible. The trick is taken by the highest card of the suit led. There are no trumps.  Scoring  Whoever takes the fewest card-points wins 5 chips, second fewest 4, third fewest 3. Ties are settled in favour of the eldest player, but a player taking no trick beats one who merely takes no card-points. A player winning every trick is paid 4 each by the others and a player taking 100 or more in card-points, but failing to win every trick, pays 4 each to the other players. In these cases, the pool remains intact and the same dealer deals again, as also if all four take the same number of card-points.  Variant  Ace may count 5 points instead of 11, and each player adds 1 point per trick to his total of card points, which may be classified as the easiest form to play the game  References   Literature  * _ (1983). \\"Bassadewitz\\".

It has a single thread-like, cylindrical leaf and a single deep blue, streaked flower. It is similar to T. mucida but is distinguished from that species by its filiform leaf and smaller flower. Description Thelymitra orientalis is a tuberous, perennial herb with a single thread-like, cylindrical leaf about long and wide with a red base. A single deep blue flower with 6 to 8 darker streaks, up to wide is borne on a flowering stem up to tall. The sepals and petals are long and wide. The column is a rich purple colour, long and about wide. The lobe on the top of the anther is black with a yellow tip divided into two parts with wavy edges. The side lobes have a few yellow hairs. Flowering occurs between late October and early-November and the flowers only open on hot days. Taxonomy and naming Thelymitra orientalis was first formally described in 2010 by Robert Bates from a specimen he collected in The Marshes Native Forest Reserve near Millicent in 2003. The description was published in the Journal of the Adelaide Botanic Garden. The specific epithet (orientalis) is a Latin word meaning \\"of the east\\", referring to fact that this orchid is related to T. mucida which is mainly a Western Australian species. Distribution and habitat This thelymitra grows in damp heath in high rainfall areas. It is found in western Victoria and the far south-east of South Australia.

KSYK) is a private secondary school located in Kulosaari, Helsinki, founded in 1940. It is an international school, teaching in both Finnish and English. The school comprises both lower secondary (yläaste) (grades 7–9) and upper secondary or gymnasium (lukio) stages, with approximately 900 pupils in total. Kulosaari is one of the leading gymnasia in the country by exam results. __TOC__ History The school was founded in 1940, when Kulosaari was still a separate municipality within the Greater Helsinki area. It was the first Finnish-language oppikoulu in the capital's eastern suburbs. The school was incorporated as a private limited company, and remains privately owned. When secondary education in Finland was reformed in the 1970s and 1980s, as part of which many private schools were nationalised, Kulosaari managed to retain its independence despite facing strong political pressure and many attempts to either close it down or take it under local authority control. Facilities The school operated originally from a residential building called 'Domus' near the present site, until 1955 when its own purpose-built facilities, designed by architect Jorma Järvi, were completed. The original school building is based around a central auditorium. Over the years the school has been extended several times, most notably and extensively in 1966 and 2000. A new library wing was added in 2015, and the 'School of Rock' music facility in 2017. Additional facilities now include gym, library and cafeteria. Principals The current principal is Mr Lauri Halla (since 2007). Previous principals were: * Kyllikki Kovero (1940–1945) * Erkki Kansanaho (1945–1954) * Kauko Joustela (1954–1956) * Matti Karstikko (1956–1978) * Kyllikki Laakso (1978–1991) * Kyllikki Vilkuna (1991–2007) Academic activities Since the 1990s Kulosaari has had an international focus, and now operates as an international school, teaching in both Finnish and English; pupils can choose to study in either language, or bilingually. The teaching staff consists of a mix of native Finnish and English speakers. In addition to the Finnish matriculation exam or ylioppilastutkinto, the Finnish secondary school leaving qualification, pupils can choose to study for the Cambridge A Levels. Admission to the lower secondary school's Finnish intake is primarily, although not exclusively, reserved for local Kulosaari residents. Admission to the English and bilingual stream is based on entrance exams. Admission to the gymnasium (upper secondary) stage is based on the applicant's lower secondary school grades. KSYK was ranked the 3rd best gymnasium (lukio) in the country, based on the 2018 matriculation exam results. Extracurricular activities Kulosaari Secondary School hosts an annual model United Nations event, called the Helsinki International Model United Nations or HELIMUN, where 9th grade pupils from Kulosaari as well as several other Finnish and some overseas schools take part in simulating the operation of the UN, to discuss and debate international issues. The May 2018 HELIMUN was the 18th edition of the event. An autumn ball (syystanssiaiset) as well as a sports day are organised annually. Throughout the academic year there are also initiatives themed around topics such as languages, arts and sciences.

No contestants were chosen on the spot; videos of their performances were viewed by all judges and hosts together before they decided on the best 10. During the course of the shows, the 10 contestants went through 7 rounds of performances in order to secure a spot in the grand finale. Each round, the contestants performed in a different genre of comedy and, unlike most competition television series, there were no eliminations till the last round. Comedic genres the contestants performed in included anecdotal, topical, observational, improv, sketch, comedy of terrors, and alternative comedy. Before each round, the contestants were mentored in each genre by one of the judges, who is touted as the expert of that specific type of comedy. The contestants had a week to prepare fresh material and practice before performing that set live in front of an audience and the judges. After their performance, each contestant was given a score, between 1 and 10, by both the audience and all the judges (except for the expert for that round). Each contestant was given feedback by the judges before revealing their score. Two separate scores were revealed to each contestant - an average of the audience's score and an average of the judges'. The mean of both scores became the final score of the round for each contestant. The finals scores were aggregated each round and, at the end of the 7th round, 5 contestants receiving the best aggregate scores were given places in the finale. For round 4 (improv), the 10 contestants were separated into 2 groups of 5. Each team was scored and their team's score also became the contestant's individual score. For round 5 (sketch), the contestants were paired up and there were 5 performances. Similarly to round 4, each pair was scored, which then became both contestants' individual scores. Aggregates of the points received by all performers each round were given to the mentor of that week. The best mentor was revealed in the grand finale and Naveen Richard came first and Kaneez Surka and Kenny Sebastian were first and second runners-up, respectively. For the grand finale, the top 5 contestants performed in the Royal Opera House, Mumbai on 20 December 2017. They were allowed to perform in any of the 7 forms of comedy they were mentored in, including a combination of them. They were scored in a similar process as the previous rounds however, the scores were not aggregated with their previous scores. At the end, Nishant Suri, the contestant with the highest score, won the competition along with prize money of 10,00,000. Selection process and format Season 2 On 10 October 2018, auditions for season 2 took place. This year the top 22 applicants auditioned for the judges in Mumbai itself on the main Comicstaan set. Applicants had to submit an application to the comicstaan website and then the shortlisted few (around 100 people) met with producers and submitted themselves for vigorous background checks. The top few were invited to Mumbai to audition for the judges. The judges debated and scored the top 22 and based on an 8-hour grueling debate session, they select the top 10 contestants. During the shows, the 10 contestants went through 7 rounds of performances to secure a spot in the grand finale. Each round, the contestants performed in a different genre of comedy and, unlike most competition television series, there were no eliminations till the last round.

In 2019, auditions took place, applicants had to submit an application to the comicstaan website and then the shortlisted few met with producers and submitted themselves for vigorous background checks. Then top 6 contestants were selected. During the shows, the 6 contestants went through 7 rounds of performances to secure a spot in the grand finale. Each round, the contestants performed in a different genre of comedy and, unlike most competition television series, there were no eliminations till the last round. Comedic genres the contestants performed in included anecdotal, topical, observational, sketch, comedy of terror and character work. Before each round, the contestants were mentored in each genre by one of the judges, who is touted as the expert of that specific type of comedy. The contestants had a week to prepare fresh material and practice before performing that set live in front of an audience and the judges. After their performance, each contestant was given a score between 1 and 10, by both the audience and all the judges (except for the expert for that round). Each contestant was given feedback by the judges before revealing their score. Two separate scores were revealed to each contestant - an average of the audience's score and an average of the judges'. The mean of both scores became the final score of the round for each contestant. The final scores were aggregated each round and at the end of the 7th round, 3 contestants receiving the best aggregate scores were given places in the finale. For the grand finale, the top 3 contestants perform in any of the 7 forms of comedy they were mentored in, including a combination of them. They are scored in a similar process however, the scores were not aggregated with their previous scores. In the end, the highest scorer wins the competition along with prize money of ₹10,00,000.

Users can pay businesses, transfer money to one another using a mobile app, linked to their credit card or (any local) bank account. As of May 2020, the service had over two million active users, out of a Hong Kong population of 7.3 million.  History  On its launch on 8 February 2017, heavy traffic meant that some users were unable to register, leading to media dubbing the service \\"Play Me\\". Topping up was only possible from a Visa or Mastercard credit card, with a limit of HK$10,000 per month. In April 2018, the app won the FinTech Grand Award in the official Hong Kong ICT Awards. From June 2018, users were able to link to a local bank account, with monthly top- up limits raised to HK$30,000, or HK$50,000 with a verified residential address. At the same time, PayMe launched an online shopping payment service, in collaboration with HKTVmall. In July 2019, PayMe introduced the support of FPS (Faster Payment System) for transfer and top-up, along with a complete redesign of the app. At the same time, PayMe lowered the top-up limit for credit cards to HK$2,000 per month.  Features  PayMe was introduced as a standalone mobile app, offering P2P social payment. Users register via a Facebook account or Hong Kong mobile phone number and authorise access to a credit card or local bank account (not necessarily a HSBC account), from which the balance can be topped up, and a bank account to receive money. There are no transaction fees. When the PayMe account balance is too low to make a given transaction, the app automatically withdraws the necessary funds from the registered bank account or card. The social networking interaction component allows users to send and request money, and split bills with others, similarly to Venmo in the United States. When the user makes a transaction, the details are posted on the social timeline, and available for other users to see, subject to privacy settings. The app encourages users to add friends, by searching for available contacts in the app. If a user makes a transaction to a non-PayMe user, a sharable payment link is created that can be distributed through social media such as WhatsApp. When the user opens the link, they can choose to collect the money by inputting their bank account, or receive it by creating a new PayMe account.

It was designed and built by the Metropolitan Water Sewerage and Drainage Board. It is also known as SPS 38, Mascot Sewage Pumping Station and SP0038. The pumping station is owned by Sydney Water, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 18 November 1999.  History  SPS 38 was the first pumping station constructed to serve the newly installed SWOOS No.1, which superseded the Botany-Rockdale Sewage Farm (ceased 1911). This action was the product of a Parliamentary Inquiry held between 1905-1908, in which it was decided to divert the sewage of the southern, western and Illawarra suburbs from the Botany and Rockdale Sewage Farms to discharge into the ocean near Long Bay. A gravitation scheme was decided upon, supplemented in places by the introduction of a slight gradient to aid in transportation. The construction of this ocean outfall sewer was carried out by the Public Works Department (PWD) and put into commission in 1919. SPS 38 was constructed to service the low-lying areas of the Cooks River Estuary and Ascot Racecourse.  Description  SPS 38 is a conventional low-level sewage pumping station (LLSPS) with a circular concrete substructure housed within a single storey Federation Free Style industrial building. Adjacent to this is a three-pump machinery well. Externally there is a slate gambrel roof with terracotta hip and ridge cappings, two timber louvered gambrel vents, projecting gable and exposed eaves with V-jointed T & G ponding boards. The masonry is well-burnt brown brick, timber framed double- hung windows with sandstone sills, brick arches and recent security grilles; entrance consisting of steel roller shutter door, recessed brick reveal and a rubbed sandstone lintel inscribed with the letters \\"MWS & DB 1915\\". Rainwater goods consist of fibre cement gutters, rainwater heads and downpipe. Internally the ceiling is lined with V-jointed T & G boarding with a large scotia cornice. There is a large ventilation grille centered on the ceiling; walls of painted brickwork and chequer plate flooring. SPS 38 is located adjacent to an inspection hall and substation which are of similar appearance. The buildings themselves stand alone in a grassed area adjacent to the old water pumping station. They can be prominently seen from General Holmes Drive and as a group have landmark value. This SPS is substantially intact. There is damage to the masonry around window security fittings, and the stone sills are severely weathered. The projecting rails which would have been fixed to the projecting gable are no loger in situ.  Heritage listing  This Station was the first of an original group of low level Sewage Pumping Stations constructed to serve the SWOOS No.1 in 1916. It is a representative example of a simple, robust and well-proportioned Federation Free Style industrial building, the architectural expressions of which can be found in the structural detailing of the facade, superb brickwork, and roof forms. In addition, the mechanical components housed within the building have potential industrial archaeological value.

It was first described in a patent in 1997 and then in a literature paper in 2003.18-methyl 16-methylene 19-nor pregnane derivatives as progestins, pharmaceutical compositions containing them and process for the preparation thereof. https://patents.google.com/patent/WO1997023498A1/en 18-Methyl-SGA is the C18 methyl or C13β ethyl derivative of segesterone acetate (SGA; 16-methylene-17α-acetoxy-19-norprogesterone), and shows 3 to 10 times the progestogenic potency of SGA in bioassays. This is analogous to the case of the 19-nortestosterone progestin norethisterone and its 18-methyl derivative levonorgestrel, the latter showing substantially increased potency relative to the former similarly. As SGA is already one of the most potent progestins to have been developed, with 100-fold the potency of progesterone and 10-fold the potency of levonorgestrel in bioassays, 18-methyl-SGA is an extremely potent progestogen, among if not the most potent known. SGA is a highly selective progestogen. Like SGA, 18-methyl-SGA shows negligible affinity for the androgen receptor. While 18-methyl-SGA has not been assessed at the other steroid hormone receptors, it is expected to be highly selective for the progesterone receptor similarly to SGA. 18-Methyl-SGA shows over 16 times the affinity of progesterone for the progesterone receptor expressed in rat uterus. In terms of oral bioavailability, it is known that SGA is not active orally, while the oral activity of 18-methyl-SGA is unknown. The addition of an 18-methyl group to SGA is unlikely to affect its rate of delivery from sustained release systems. As such, 18-methyl-SGA should be ideally suited for use via routes of administration like subcutaneous implants and transdermal patches. { class=\\" mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\\" style=\\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: none;\\" + class=\\"nowrap\\"  Comparison of potencies of selected progestogens in animals - !

The Penguin Book of Card Games. London: Penguin (2008), p. 113. . is an historical card game for four players in which three play against a soloist. It is one of the earliest games to use the terms Bettel – a contract to lose every trick – and Mord - a contract to win every trick. It is still played in Germany today.  History  Brandeln is recorded as early as 1829 in the Neuestes Allgemeines Spielbuch which states that its origin is uncertain, but that it is a thoroughly German game whose features were adopted by some of the \\"newer French and English games\\" and even by Ombre. Brandeln continues to be regularly published in German and Austrian games compendia from that time until the present day.  Rules   Cards  The game is played with 28 cards from a 32-card deck of French playing cards with the Eights removed.  Ranking  In the trump suit the Jack (Bube) and the Seven are the highest trumps; the ranking runs thus: Jack > Seven > Ace > King > Queen (Dame) > Ten > Nine In the other suits the ranking of card values for taking tricks is the usual: Ace > King > Queen > Jack > Ten > Nine > Seven  Preparation  Seating and dealing is as per normal. Dealing, bidding and playing are all in clockwise order. Each player is dealt seven cards in packets of two, three and two again.  Bidding  The player to the left of the dealer is forehand and the first to bid. *If he believes he can win three tricks in one of the four suits, which then become trumps, he says \\"Brandle\\" (\\"Ein Brandel\\") or \\"I'll brandle\\" (\\"Ich brandle\\"). *If he passes, bidding passes to the second, third and fourth players. The bidder can also be outbid by 4, 5, 6 tricks, but can play the Brandel by which he is outbid, himself. The player does not announce the suit in which he intends to \\"brandle\\" until he has won the auction. If a player call a Bettel (\\"Beggar\\"), he is offering not to take any tricks. A Bettel beats a 6-trick Brandel. The highest contract, which beats all the others, is Mord, in which is where a player has to take all 7 tricks.  Playing  The player who has announced the highest bid wins the auction and leads to the first trick. Players must follow suit or, if not able to, play a trump. In a Bettel contract, in which there are no trumps, players must play a higher card if they can.  Scoring  Points for winning are awarded as follows: * 3-trick Brandel - 3 points * 4-trick Brandel - 4 points * 5-trick Brandel - 5 points * 6-trick Brandel - 6 points * Bettel - 7 points * Mord - 8 points If the declarer (the winner of the auction) loses, he pays the 3 defenders the same amount each. Over- and under-tricking does not count.  References   Literature  * _ (1829). Neustes Allgemeines Spielbuch. C.

Historically development has spread from the lower areas upstream, and in the 2000s there has been growth in commercial and residential land use in the upper basin. Hydrology Stoney Creek is in the inner coastal plain of North Carolina, an area with slow streams and large swamp areas. From upstream to downstream the creek's tributaries are Stoney Run, Howell Creek, Reedy Branch and Billy Branch. The upper watershed contains slowly moving blackwater streams, low lying wooded swamps and marsh floodplains. Often the streams flow through swampy areas. There are many small dams in the upper watershed made by farmers or beavers. About 42% of the floodplain is developed, 28% used for agriculture, 23% is forested and 6.1% is wetlands. The area is prone to flooding. Annual rainfall is about with highest rainfall from June to September, usually from thunderstorms. Waste water is not discharged into the creek.

Her major contribution to the discipline was three edited collections of newly-found diplomas that acquired a scholarly authority and place as the direct successor of Theodor Mommsen and Herbert Nesselhauf. She also edited the diplomas for publication in The Roman Inscriptions of Britain.  Education and career  Although her first degree was awarded in Psychology from University College London in 1948, in 1960 she started a university extension course in archaeology. She earned a diploma with distinction from the Institute of Archaeology in 1967, and she gained her PhD some six years later. Her thesis topic was on the auxiliary regiments of the Iberian peninsula. After being awarded her doctorate she lectured at the London University extramural department and the Inner London Education Authority. She undertook her research for over thirty years with minimal help in kind from a number of institutions, including an Honorary Research Fellowship at the Institute of Archaeology and then at the Institute of Classical Studies in Senate House. Much of her work took place in a tiny room she was granted on the fourth floor of the Institute of Archaeology. Through her numerous publications she made sure the discovery of new military diplomas were made promptly available, travelling widely within Europe to do so, and making her expertise available in connection with the diplomas emerging from eastern Europe. Through her publications she illuminated the potential for Roman military diplomas as a source material and the significance of the information that could be gleaned from their study. For example, one diploma, issued to a soldier in the army of Britain on 23 March 178, was found in Bulgaria. It was shown to Margaret in the 1990s, and she showed it was possible to clarify—and challenge—part of the account of the suppression of an invasion of Britain given by the Graeco-Roman historian Cassius Dio. Her work was noted for its care, skill and rigor.  Honours  Margaret Roxan was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1981, and was a corresponding member of the German Archaeological Institute. She was awarded an emeritus fellowship by the Leverhulme Trust in 1993, which held a conference in her honour in May 2002.  Personal life  Margaret Roxan (née Quantrill) was born on 21 January 1924 in Hackney, London. In 1945, she married David Roxan, a journalist, with whom she had five children, and remained married to him until his death in 1999. She died on 26 June 2003.  Selected publications  * 1977 (with J.

It was released on April 19, 2019, by 604, School Boy and Interscope Records as the fourth single off of the record. It is a midtempo funk-pop, synth-pop, disco, electropop and dance song influenced by soft rock. Background and release \\"Julien\\" was written at Maderas Village, Nicaragua in August 2016. Jepsen revealed that the title was inspired by an ex-boyfriend with whom she had a \\"romantic weekend\\" in Quebec City, saying that she found the name \\"musical\\" and has been trying to write it into a song since they met, going through multiple different songs of the same name. She stated, however, that the song itself is not about a specific person, but is a metaphor of \\"what it is to have that person that is maybe the one that got away\\". The singer described \\"Julien\\" as \\"the heart\\" of Dedicated and stated that it is about an \\"everlasting fantastical love\\" that follows you for the rest of your life. Jepsen posted a line from the song and announced its release date on social media on April 16, 2019. It was released as an instant download alongside the pre-order for Dedicated on April 19, 2019 as the fourth single off of the album. The song was performed live throughout The Dedicated Tour. Composition and lyrics \\"Julien\\" is a \\"squelchy\\" and \\"shimmery\\" midtempo funk-pop, synth-pop, disco, electropop and dance song composed in the key of A minor. It has a tempo of 119 beats per minute and influences of soft rock. Its instrumentation consists of a \\"clean, robotic\\" and \\"driving\\" beat, \\"soft\\" and \\"swelling\\" guitars, as well as \\"slippery\\" synths. Lyrically, the track is a \\"simmering reflection on fleeting romance\\", which portrays Jepsen as a \\"wounded animal, searching for a way to cauterize her injuries as she lies on the road to heartbreak\\". Jepsen \\"sings about somebody she wishes she was with\\" and \\"tells the story of a long lost love that she prays will come back but knowing deep down that he probably won't\\" on the song. Critical reception Mark Young of Mxdwn called the song the \\"centerpiece of the album\\", and complimented the synthesizers used in the beginning of the song. Young also praised the buildup verse to pre-chorus to hook, writing that it is \\"perfectly executed\\". Writing for Pitchfork, Anna Gaca noted the \\"windshield-wiper synths that open Julien\\", \\"pointing to Jepsen's other guiding aesthetic: chill disco\\". Music critics Heather Phares of AllMusic and Anthony Fantano highlighted \\"Julien\\" as one of the best songs on Dedicated.

The Qur'an differentiates between two manasiks: The Manasik of Hajj, has to be donein the month Dhu al-Hijjah and The Manasik of ʿUmra, which can be performed any time of the year. The knowledge of manasik is an independent part of Fiqh.  Qur'anic statements  The Arabic term mansak or mansik, to which manāsik forms the plural, is nomen loci to the Arabic word nusuk. The term nusuk occurs even in the Qur'an in Sura 2:196, where it refers to a sacrifice that has to be made as a substitute if the pilgrim prematurely carves his head hair. As a nomen loci, the term mansak thus refers to a place of sacrifice.Hans Wehr: Arabisches Wörterbuch für die Schriftsprache der Gegenwart. Arabisch-Deutsch. 5. Aufl. Harrasowitz, Wiesbaden, 1985. S. 1270.language German However, it has undergone a change of meaning over time. Even in the Qur'an itself, the term is used for certain sacrificial rites. In this sense, the term already appears in two places in the 22nd Sura named after the Hajj, in verse 34 and verse 67. In addition, the plural term occurs twice in Sura 2 in connection with pilgrimage. In the first passage, Sura 2:128, Abraham addresses the petition to God to show him and his Muslim offspring the rites (manasik). In the second passage, Sura 2:200, believers are called upon to commemorate the manasik of God, as they had inherited thought of their fathers. The term is already used in the Qur'an for the entirety of the pilgrimage ceremonies.  History  One of the earliest experts in manāsik was the Prophet's Compassionate Abdullah ibn Umar. From him, it is reported that he alternately went one year to Hajj and the other year to 'Umrah.Ibn \`Asakir: Ta'rīḫ madīnat Dimašq . XXI, p. 163, 192. During the pilgrimage season (mausim) he was then active as Mufti. al-Fasawī: \\"Kitāb al-Ma'rifa wa-t-tārīḫ.\\" Baghdad 1975, Vol. I, p. 491. Together with Abd Allah ibn Abbas he delivered his Fatwa - Sessions on the arrival of the pilgrims. Al-Dhahabi: \\" Siyar a'lām al-nubalā \\" Beirut 1981, Vol. III, p. 222. One of the earliest monographic treatises on the entirety of the pilgrimage rites is the Kitāb al-Manāsik of (died 735/6). The first part of this work is preserved in the tradition of his disciple Sa'īd ibn Abī'Arūba (died 773). Later, numerous other Manāsik works were written. As reported by Christiaan Snouck Hurgronje, who was in Mecca at the end of the 19th century, the Manasik were taught to the pilgrims in their own colleges before the pilgrimage began.Christiaan Snouck Hurgronje: \\"Mecca. Volume II: From Today's Life\\". Nijhoff, Hague, 1888-1889. P. 292. Digitalisat Today, Indonesian children are given the opportunity to learn the pilgrim rites with models of the Ka'aba. There are several general guidelines for Umrah and Hajj General Ethical Guidelines When Umrah / Hajj that must be known by pilgrims when in Medina and Mecca wants to do Hajj or Umrah. Things that we may not apply in the country should be done in the Holy Land such as maintaining courtesy towards other people from many countries.

He began his career with Preston North End, but never appeared for their first team, and played non-league football for Tamworth, Colne, Droylsden, Stalybridge Celtic, Bamber Bridge, Congleton Town, Ramsbottom United and Darlington, before signing for Scottish Premiership club St Mirren in 2018. After spending time on loan at Kidderminster Harriers, he was released by St Mirren, and signed for Bradford (Park Avenue) in September 2019 after a short second spell with Darlington. He also played for Longridge Town before moving to Australia. Life and career Preston North End Heaton was born in Preston, Lancashire, and attended All Hallows Catholic High School in nearby Penwortham. He first played for his local Football League club, Preston North End, as an under-seven, signed for them as an under-eight, and progressed through the ranks, taking up a two-year scholarship in 2013. In November 2014, he joined Tamworth of the Conference North on a work experience loan. Because of injuries and suspensions, he went straight into the starting eleven for the visit to Lowestoft Town the following day, and played the whole of a 3–2 defeat. He established himself as a regular in the side, and finished the season with 22 league starts. After his scholarship ended in June 2015, Heaton was the only one of his year group to be taken on as a professional: he signed a one-year contract with the option of a second. He was given squad number 29, and was included among the substitutes for the visit to Sheffield Wednesday in October; Preston lost 3–1, and Heaton remained unused. In November, he rejoined Tamworth on loan, but this time he made only four appearances over a two-month spell. He finished the season on loan at Colne of the North-West Counties League. He was sent off on his debut, conceding a penalty that tied the scores in the local derby against Barnoldswick Town, but his team went on to win. He contributed three more league appearances as the team gained promotion to the Northern Premier League. Heaton was released by Preston in the summer of 2016 when his contract expired. Non-league football After interest from Championship clubs Reading and Wigan Athletic and trials with non-league teams including AFC Fylde and Bamber Bridge, Heaton signed for Droylsden of the Northern Premier League Division One North. He soon moved up two tiers to Stalybridge Celtic of the National League North, but made just two appearances at that level before returning to the NPL Division One with Bamber Bridge. By the end of the season he had been on the winning side in the Challenge Cup final and earned himself a new one-year contract. In the summer of 2017, he agreed to join National League North club Darlington, but the move collapsed over personal terms, complicated by a collarbone broken while playing in a pre-season fixture for his potential employers. He remained a Bamber Bridge player, and spent a month on loan at Congleton Town to regain match fitness. Released by Bamber Bridge in mid- October, he then played three matches for Northern Premier League Division One team Ramsbottom United on a non-contract basis, before finally joining Darlington in mid-November. Although happy in his work as a delivery driver, Heaton was open about his ambition to return to full-time football as soon as possible, and hoped that Darlington was \\"the right move for me to hopefully help me progress\\". Initially, he was seen as a work in progress: Darlington's management team, Tommy Wright and former centre-back Alan White, told him \\"You'll not play regularly but you'll get your chance, you'll be involved\\". By February, he had established himself as a regular in Darlington's starting eleven, and in March, he signed a new two-year contract \\"to give him the wage improvement that he deserves\\". He finished the season with 22 league appearances. St Mirren Together with Darlington teammates Luke Trotman and Joe Wheatley, Heaton was selected to attend a course at Jamie Vardy's V9 Academy designed to help non-league players get into professional football. He attracted attention from a variety of clubs including Everton and Middlesbrough before manager Alan Stubbs signed Heaton and another player from the V9 Academy course, Cody Cooke, for Scottish Premiership club St Mirren. Heaton signed a three-year contract; the fee, officially undisclosed but reported in the media as £75,000, was described on the club's website as the largest paid by St Mirren \\"in around 25 years\\". Heaton was an unused substitute for St Mirren's opening fixture, in the League Cup against Kilmarnock, and made his debut in their second group match, at home to Spartans of the Lowland League on 17 July. He played the whole match as St Mirren won on penalties. He made one more appearance in the League Cup and turned out for St Mirren's under-21 side in the Scottish Challenge Cup, but four selections as an unused substitute were as close as he came to a Premiership debut. He returned to English football in January 2019 when he signed for Kidderminster Harriers on loan until the end of the season, but made only eight National League North appearances. He was released by St Mirren in July 2019. Return to non-league football Heaton rejoined Darlington on a non- contract basis in August 2019. He played seven times in the National League North, mostly as a substitute with Louis Laing and Terry Galbraith preferred at centre back. Standing in for the unfit Galbraith away to King's Lynn Town at the end of August, he made defensive errors that contributed to both goals in a 2–0 defeat, and was allowed to leave after just five weeks with the club. He signed for Bradford (Park Avenue) on 13 September, and made his debut the following day in a 1–1 draw at home to Spennymoor United in the National League North.

It is formed from mifepristone in the liver by the enzyme CYP3A4 via monodemethylation, and circulates at concentrations higher than those of mifepristone. The metabolite retains partial but considerable affinity for the progesterone receptor (PR) and the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) ( = 21% and 61% of that of mifepristone for the human forms of these receptors, respectively). On the basis of actions that are apparently independent of its hormonal activity, metapristone is being researched as a potential cancer metastatic chemopreventive agent.

His complexion and physical appearance have been compared to John Belushi,Jon Lovitz, and Steve Zissis, with a comic voice comparable to Nathan Lane's. He prefers the Practical Aesthetics school of thought, pioneered by David Mamet, William H. Macy and Robert Bella, but has actively participated in various other acting styles and techniques. Hirsh starred as himself in an improvised Thesis project directed by Washington University senior Lora Ivanova in 2003. I See (You See) was a one-act play starring five actors, one of which would be audience-voted to strap a video camera to their head while playing out suggestions for improvisational scenes. The piece, mostly comic, was met with positive reception. Hirsh's most notable performance was his portrayal of Sir Vashya Shontine in Tennessee Williams' one-act play, Me, Vashya, written in 1937 during the playwright's short tenure at Washington University.The Source, PAD to debut Williams play Me, Vashya, February 6, 2004 The complete script was later published in the compilation The Magic Tower and Other One-Act Plays by publisher New Directions.Google Books, The Magic Tower and Other One-Act Plays, April 25, 2011 Me, Vashya was performed as a World Premiere production with The Glass Menagerie as part of the Washington University in St Louis Tennessee Williams Symposium in February 2004.The Source, 20 years after his death, a Tennessee Williams work is staged for the first time, December 19, 2003 Hirsh's third World Premiere production, Six Seconds in Charlack, by Washington University alumni Brian Golden premiered on April 28 of 2005.The Source, Six Seconds in Charlack: Hotchner- winning play to debut April 28-May 1, April 20, 2005 Charlack was later performed on New York City's Off-Off-Broadway circuit at the Clemente Soto Vélez Cultural Center in August 2009.Theatermania, 6 Seconds in Charlack, August 28, 2009 Theatrical Performances *The Wizard and the Shepherdess (1998) as Narrator *All in the Timing (2001) as Don *Alice in Wonderland (2002) as Humpty Dumpty *Once in a Lifetime (2002) as Herman Glogauer *I See (You See) (World Premiere, 2003) as Himself *All's Well That Ends Well (2003) as Parolles *Guys & Dolls (2003) as Nathan Detroit *School for Wives (2003) as The Notary *Me, Vashya (World Premiere, 2004) as Sir Vashya Shontine *Cabaret (2004) as Herr Schultz *Downsize (2004) as Walter *The Fantasticks (2004) as El Gallo *Six Seconds in Charlack (World Premiere, 2005) as Scoop and TSA Officer *Tick, Tick...

Following a divorce from Aline Gray in 2009, filmmaker Parthiban Shanmugam proposed the creation of a biographical film starring Hirsh and Atlanta singer/songwriter Debbie Aviva Kessler. The film's style would mimic My Dinner With Andre, in which the bulk of the picture was a completely improvised conversation between the two main characters, as well as footage from Hirsh and Gray's actual wedding, with a subsection devoted to Primal Therapy as the film's penultimate sequence. 3 Cats and a Man screened only once on May 17, 2012 in France.IMDb, Unhappy with the outcome, Shanmugam had the film re- edited and retitled Pikuach Nefesh: Saving DanielIMDb, in 2016. The latter gained more attention due to Shanmugam's burgeoning social media presence, and was released through Amazon Prime Video in 2017. The film received generally negative critical reviews, with one user commenting, \\"Daniel is not a particularly interesting person, in fact he is pretty boring,\\" and another, \\"The characters are odd, and I didn't find myself liking either of them. More like feeling sorry for them. I give the main character credit for loving the film \\"Harold and Maude,\\" though.\\"  References  Category:1982 births Category:Living people Category:20th-century American comedians Category:20th- century American male actors Category:20th-century American writers Category:21st-century American comedians Category:21st-century American male actors Category:21st-century American writers Category:American film producers Category:American male comedy actors Category:American male comedians Category:American male television actors Category:American male writers Category:American male screenwriters Category:American television writers Category:Male actors from Milwaukee Category:Writers from Milwaukee Category:Filmmakers from Milwaukee Category:Washington University in St. Louis alumni Category:American male television writers ","title":"Daniel Hirsh"},{"id":"57740494","text":"Jerzy Piskun (4 June 1938 - 16 July 2018)Zmarł Jerzy Piskun, dwukrotny olimpijczyk i wicemistrz Europy w koszykówce was a Polish basketball player.

It was created and written by Karl Pilkington and Richard Yee (who also directed the series). Pilkington stars as both lead characters, playing his namesake Karl, and the voice inside his head that takes the form of his Doppelgänger. The series is set around Ladbroke Grove in London and follows Karl, a bored taxi driver who has been dumped by his girlfriend Zoe and moves in with his elderly American aunt Norma, and is struggling to get his life back on track. Karl's closest companion is the voice in his head, a sardonic, outspoken alter ego who takes the form of his double – it's the uncensored true version of Karl that says what he really thinks without the risk of offending others. As Karl attempts to move on from the break up and sort out his life, the voice in his head appears periodically to guide, criticise and dispense his unorthodox philosophy of life. Pilkington and Yee have worked together since 2009 on An Idiot Abroad and The Moaning of Life. Sick of It is the first scripted project they have collaborated on.

Record sales reached the peak in 1999, when 600 million people spent an average of $64 in buying records, bringing a total of $40 billion sales of recorded music. Sales continued declining in the 21st century. The collapse of record sales also made artists rely on touring for most of their income. By 2019, record sales had accounted for less than half of global recorded music revenue, overtaken by streaming.https://www.ifpi.org/news/IFPI-issues-annual- Global-Music-Report According to Guinness World Records, Michael Jackson's 1982 album Thriller remains the best-selling album in history, with an estimated 66 million copies sold worldwide. \\"Candle in the Wind 1997\\" is the best-selling physical single of all time with 33 million copies sold. Although precise worldwide sales figure is hard to obtain, it is widely acknowledged that the Beatles have sold more records than any other artist in the history of recorded music. History Before the existence of recording medium and its player, the music industry earned profit through selling musical compositions on sheet music. The very first sales chart published by Billboard magazine in the United States was the Sheet Music Best Sellers chart. Following the invention of the phonograph by Thomas Edison in 1877, the music industry began hiring singers to record songs made by composers. Due to the length limit of recording media, singles were the only available commercial releases. In 1900, the US record sales is estimated at about 3 million copies. The music industry continued its growth, and by 1921 the value of record sales in the US reached $106 million with 140 million records being sold. Album sales were first reported by Billboard magazine on March 24, 1945. However, the album definition at the time was barely boxes containing a set of several singles, such as Glenn Miller by Glenn Miller, as well as Selections from Going My Way and Merry Christmas by Bing Crosby. Technological developments in the early twentieth century led to the development of the vinyl LP record as an important medium for recorded music. In 1948, Columbia Records began to bring out 33 rpm twelve-inch extended-play LPs that could play for as long as 52 minutes, or 26 minutes per side. Musical film soundtracks, jazz works, and thematic albums by singers such as Frank Sinatra quickly utilized the new longer format. Billboard launched its first regularly published weekly albums chart, Best Selling Popular Albums, on March 24, 1956. During the 1950s and into the 1960s, 45 rpm seven-inch single sales were considered the primary market for the recording industry, while albums were a secondary market. The careers of notable rock and roll performers such as Elvis Presley were driven primarily by single sales. Album sales reached its peak in English-language popular music from the mid 1960s to the mid 2000s (known as \\"album era\\") in which the album was the dominant form of recorded music expression and consumption.Synopsis of \\"When Albums Ruled the World.\\" from BBC Four's The Golden Age Of The Album series. Retrieved 5 January 2014. From the early 1980s, the CD became the dominant format for both albums and singles, due to factors such as higher audio quality, durability, ease of use, and longer playing time. In 1986, Dire Straits' Brothers in Arms became the first album in history to sell over one million copies on CD. In October 2005, \\"Hollaback Girl\\" by Gwen Stefani was the first single ever to sell one million digital downloads.https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/stefani-peas-lead- singles-boom-106080/ Downloads have been in decline since 2013 as consumers have moved away from a purchase/ownership model towards a streaming model. Marketing A crowd buying records in the Dusty Groove store during the Record Store Day, April 2014. Aside of paid advertising in print or broadcast media, radio airplay is one of the most important tools to sell records. A research commissioned by one of major label groups stated that \\"four out of five music purchases can be traced to radio airplay. In 2007, Record Store Day was inaugurated to bring together fans, artists, and thousands of independent record stores across the world. The 2013 event of Record Store Day was credited with the highest U.S. vinyl sales, and the 2014 edition resulted in independent retailers recording the highest percentage of physical album sales, since the SoundScan system was introduced in 1991. Merchandise bundles In 2004, Prince became the first major artist to bundle his album, Musicology, with tour ticket purchases, giving copies of the album to each audience upon entrance to the venue. Those copies were counted as sales for the album on the Billboard 200 chart during its corresponding week of each concert. This strategy led Billboard and Nielsen SoundScan tighten up their policy on how tickets bundled with albums would count for charting purposes. Travis Scott bundled his 2018 album Astroworld with his 28-piece merchandise line, which contributed to first-week sales exceeding 270,000 traditional units and a number-one debut on the Billboard 200. RIAA summary by format, in million copies per year.https://www.riaa.com/u-s-sales-database/ Financial loss At times, labels over-shipped records to retailer due to the high expectation of commercial response. However, when records fail to be sold to consumers, retailers may return the unsold copies to the label. In January 2008, media reported that over one million unsold copies of Robbie Williams's album Rudebox were sent to China to be crushed. EMI owner Guy Hands said, \\"Roughly 85% of what EMI does get to release never makes a profit, in part because of the cash spent signing bands and partly due to ill-made bets on the number of CDs the market requires for particular acts.\\" In 2011, Amazon sold an estimated 440,000 copies of Lady Gaga's Born This Way in its first two days at a price of 99 cents. This promotional campaign caused a loss of over $3 million for the company. In 2014, U2's album Songs of Innocence was released for free on iTunes. Apple's deal with U2 and the band’s label, Universal Music, which stands to lose more than a million full-price sales because of the free download offer, guarantees $100m worth of high-profile marketing for the album. Second-hand record sales The sale of second-hand albums and singles continues into the 2020s, with many record stores having a used section, as well as pawn shops such as CeX, Cash Generator, Cash Converters,https://www.thefranchisemagazine.net/owners- stories/achieve-1-million-turnover-with-cex-192 and the emergence of eBay, MusicMagpie, Alibris and other dedicated websites.https://www.forbes.com/sites/billrosenblatt/2018/09/18/vinyl-is- bigger-than-we-thought-much-bigger/https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment- arts-43973448 See also *Record label *Record collecting *Music recording certification *List of best-selling music artists *List of best-selling albums *List of best-selling singles *Album-equivalent unit References Category:Recorded music Category:Sales Category:Music industry ","title":"Record sales"},{"id":"57740751","text":"Alkemstone is a 1981 video game published by Level-10.

The war lasted between February 1789 and April 1793 and was fought in the context of the Russo-Turkish War (1787–1792) and local power struggles. The Souliotes achieved a defensive victory but failed to foment a big Christian insurrection as originally planned. Background With the outbreak of the Russo-Turkish War in August 1787, Russian Empress Catherine the Great laid out her plans to incite revolts across Ottoman Greece. Proclamations calling the Greek clergy to lead a war of liberation against the Ottomans were printed in September 1787 and February 1788. In March, Admiral Samuel Greig and Major-General Ivan Zaborovsky were tasked with signing alliances and facilitating revolts among the Christian populations in Dalmatia, Albania and Greece. The Russian consulate in the Heptanese activated its network of sleeper agents who had originally been recruited before the Orlov revolt. Louitzis Sotiris and Himariot Panos Bitsilis begin recruiting soldiers in the area of Epirus, while Antonis Psaros and Lambros Katsonis built a small naval force in Italy. For the most part Russian plans did not materialize as the Baltic Fleet failed to reach the Mediterranean Sea. Without its assistance most of Russia's local allies refused to take part in the rising. In March 1788, Sotiris reached Preveza where he delivered Russian proclamations to the chieftains of the Souliotes. He recruited numerous persons to man Katsonis' fleet destined for the Aegean Sea. He also managed to convince the Souliotes to swear an oath of allegiance to Catherine in September in return for patents granting them military ranks in the Russian army. On 3 March 1790, the leaders of the greatest Souliote clans reconfirmed their oath in written form, promising to fight against the Muslims of Rumelia. In May 1788, Ali the newly appointed pasha of Ioannina received orders to head north to assist the Sublime Porte in its war against the Austrians. When Ali was informed by Lassalle, the French consul in Preveza, of the upcoming Souliote revolt, he launched a recruitment drive in Ioannina in order to defend the Pashalik of Yanina. Conflict Hostilities began in February 1789, when Ali Pasha's men attacked a group of Souliotes in Louro and stole their cattle. The Souliotes responded by launching an offensive from the Lakka village and killing any Muslim they encountered. Ali Pasha dispatched an army of 3,000 Turco-Albanians to pursue the Souliotes back into their mountain strongholds. Hoping to divide Ali's lands between themselves Ibrahim Pasha of Vlorë, Mustapha Pasha of Delvinë, Cham Aghas and the Beys of Gjirokastër secretly aid the Souliotes and open a new front against him in Korçë. The Souliotes thus found themselves temporarily allied with their erstwhile enemies. In May, Ali Pasha receives a firman from the Ottoman sultan, supporting his war against Souli. Ali Pasha captures Souliote lands laying beyond mount Tomaros, however he offers them peace to focus his attention on their allies. Seeing that Russian aid has yet to arrive and the treaty will result in their appointment as armatoloi, the Souliotes sign the peace agreement in June. A small minority of Souliotes that were not included in the treaty continue their armed struggle, robbing and massacring civilians regardless of their religious affiliation as far as Makrynoros and Pindus. Ali Pasha defeats Mustapha Pasha and Ibrahim Pasha in a series of clashes that take place in the vicinity of Kastoria and Korçë that last throughout the summer. Admiral Gibbs who replaced Zaborovsky, scolds the Souliotes for abandoning the service of the Russian crown in an official letter. Confusion ensues after Sotiris, Bitsilis and the Souliotes exchange accusations of embezzling Russian funds. Realizing that the longevity of their peace with Ali Pasha depends entirely on the outcome of the Russo-Turkish War, the Souliotes dispatch two representatives to the Russian court in Saint Petersburg to clear their name. They are denied an audience in December 1789 but are granted admission in April 1790, receiving the empress' support. Ali Pasha buys or seizes lands surrounding the Souliote villages and chases bandits and rebellious armatoloi into Venetian held Parga. In May 1792, he gathers 10,000 to 20,000 troops in preparation of an offensive against the Beys of Gjirokastër. The Souliotes are also called upon to participate but only Lambros Tzavelas and 70 of his men turn up. Tzavelas is immediately imprisoned and Souli is revealed to be the real target of the campaign. Georgios Botsaris organizes the defense of the four Souliote villages, Lambros Tzavelas promises Ali the support of his clan but betrays him and joins the defenders. On 27 July 1792, the two sides face off at Kiafa, where Ali Pasha is defeated and forced to retreat to Ioannina and initiate peace talks. According to Christoforos Perraivos, the battle resulted in the death of 2,000 Turco-Albanians and 74 Souliotes, while 97 Souliotes were wounded. A Venetian chronicle puts Ottoman casualties to 600. Talks last until April 1793, when the final peace treaty is signed. The rights of the Souliotes are upheld and Ali Pasha pays them ransom for the prisoners of war they had taken at Kiafa. Fotos Tzavelas the son of Lambros Tzavelas was released from Ottoman captivity, but his clan is blamed for the war by the Souliotes and lost its former prestige.

Biography  Jones graduated from Cardiff University with a degree in zoology, before working as a science teacher in the UK and Greece. Next, Jones worked as a research assistant at the British School at Athens, before undertaking an MPhil and then PhD in Archaeology at the University of Cambridge. After completing her PhD, Jones worked in the Department of Urban Archaeology, Museum of London, before commencing an academic post at the University of Sheffield in 1984. In 2004 Jones was appointed Professor of Archaeology. Jones has pioneered the development of archaeobotanical methodologies including ethnobotany, crop- processing analysis, weed ecology, and aDNA, and archaeobotanical research in Greece. Early work used ethnographic observations of crop-processing in Greece to produce models which could be applied to archaeobotanical remains. From the 1990s onwards, Jones has worked with colleagues including Amy Bogaard to develop the application of functional weed ecology to archaeobotanical assemblages in order to reconstruct past crop husbandry. More recently, Jones has been utilising DNA of modern landraces to investigate the spread of domesticated cereals into Europe, and working to develop the application of stable isotope analysis to archaeobotanical remains. Jones is noted for her skill in teaching and research. Jones is credited with initiating archaeobotanical study in Greece, training Greek archaeologists in archaeobotany and initiating the recovery of macroscopic plant remains from archaeological sites. Jones was elected as a Fellow of the British Academy in 2013. She is a vice-president of the British School at Athens, and serves on the editorial board of the Journal of Archaeological Science.

After leaving the Ballets Russes in 1927 she set up her own company, with Anton Dolin, engaging George Balanchine and others as choreographers.Kisselgoff, Anna. \\"Vera Nemtchinova, 84, Dies; Diaghilev Star and Teacher\\", The New York Times, 24 July 1984, p. B6 After she retired from dancing Nemtchinova settled in New York in 1947, where she established a studio as a ballet teacher. She was twice married, both times to dancers: first Nicolas Sverev (with whom she had danced in the Diaghilev company) and then Anatole Oboukhov, of the Mariinsky Ballet company. She died in New York, at the age of 84.

NBDA assumes that social transmission of a behavior follows the social network of associations or interactions among individuals, since individuals who spend a lot of time together, or who interact more have more opportunity to learn from each other. Therefore, NBDA infers social transmission if the spread of a novel behavior follows the social network of a population. NBDA thus allows the study of social learning to be linked to animal behavior research that uses social network analysis. NBDA was introduced by Franz & Nunn and further developed by Hoppitt, Boogert, & Laland.  Implementation  NBDA requires prior knowledge about the underlying social network of a population. In an observational study, the order (or timing) at which individuals in the population acquire a behaviour or information is recorded. NBDA then tests whether the spread of information or behaviour is explained by the previously determined network or not. Because more closely associated individuals are more likely to interact with each other, information is assumed to travel along social ties. If there is a good match between the diffusion of information and the underlying network social transmission is assume. Otherwise, it is assumed that information was asocially acquired (e.g. trial and error, mistakes, etc.).  Application  NBDA does not only serve as a tool for the detection of social learning, but also allows the estimation of the strength of the social transmission effect. In addition, several individual-level variables can be included in the analysis, which have potential influence on an individual's learning rate (e.g. gender, rank or age), and can also be used to model the effect of, and statistically control for potential ecological and genetic influences. NBDA has been successfully used in a number of studies to identify and quantify the effects of social transmission on the spread of behaviors in both wild and captive animal populations such as starlings, chimpanzees or humpback whales  Examples  * Lobtail-feeding in humpback whales * Foraging strategies in tits * Moss-sponging in chimpanzees  References   External links  * Category:Ethology Category:Research methods Category:Networking algorithms Category:Social networks ","title":"Network-based diffusion analysis"},{"id":"57740854","text":"What Men Want is a 2019 American romantic comedy film directed by Adam Shankman and starring Taraji P. Henson, Aldis Hodge, Josh Brener, Erykah Badu, Richard Roundtree and Tracy Morgan. The film is a loose remake of the 2000 film What Women Want. The plot follows a woman who – after drinking a potent concoction given by a shaman – gains the ability to hear men's inner thoughts. The screenplay was written by Jas Waters and Tina Gordon Chism. The film was released in the United States on February 8, 2019, by Paramount Pictures and BET Films. It grossed over $72 million worldwide. Like What Women Want, it received mixed reviews from critics, although Henson's performance was praised. Plot Ali Davis is a successful sports agent in Atlanta who feels boxed out by her male colleagues. When she is passed over for a promotion at Summit Worldwide Management, her boss Nick explains that she does not connect well with men. Determined to succeed in a man's world, Ali announces that she will sign up-and-coming basketball star Jamal Barry. After getting drinks with her father, Ali flirts with the bartender, Will. They have sex at his home, where Ali encounters his young son, Ben. At a photo shoot, Ali stands up for her client but angers Joe \\"Dollah\\" Barry, Jamal's father and manager. At her friend Mari's bachelorette party, Ali is introduced to Sister, a psychic. To help Ali \\"connect with men\\", Sister gives her \\"fey lougawou\\" (Kalanchoe pinnata) tea to drink. While dancing with her friends at a club, Ali is knocked unconscious. Waking up in the hospital, she hears the thoughts of her doctor. Ali and her assistant Brandon realize that she has gained the ability to hear men's thoughts. They track down Sister, who convinces Ali that her power is an asset. Using her newfound ability, Ali learns about a poker game attended by her fellow agents and Joe. She shows up uninvited but impresses Joe, and is invited to join Summit's meeting with Jamal. Ali saves her coworker Kevin's pitch to Jamal and Joe; Kevin later confronts Ali, and reveals that he had voted to make her partner. Discerning that Joe does not trust a woman without a family, Ali passes off Will and Ben, who have come to return her misplaced driver's license, as her husband and son. She invites them all to an NBA game, where – unbeknownst to Will or Ben – she uses her \\"family\\" to further impress Joe. On a double date with Will, Mari, and Mari's fiancé James, Ali hears James' cheating thoughts, and also hears that Will only has thoughts for her. They have sex, with Ali using Will's thoughts to fully satisfy him. The Summit office is shocked to discover that agent Ethan has quit and signed Jamal himself, withdrawing him from the NBA draft to play in China instead. Nick berates Ali, stating that the only reason he will not fire her is because she is a black woman. He reveals her family charade to Will, who tells Ali to stay away from him and Ben. At Mari's wedding, Ali hears James' thoughts and, angrily dismissing Brandon's attempt to intervene, she drunkenly announces that James slept with Mari's cousin. She also reveals that her friend Ciarra's husband is cheating on her, and a brawl breaks out. Ali is again knocked unconscious. She wakes up at the hospital, realizing she can no longer read minds. With her father's advice, Ali reconciles with Brandon and her friends. She finds Jamal, who explains that he does not want to go to China, and Ali tells him to follow his heart. Jamal decides to stay, and becomes the first NBA draft pick. Ali is promoted to partner, but quits to start her own agency with Kevin, as well as Brandon, finally making him an agent. Arriving at Ben's birthday party, Ali asks Will for another chance, and he agrees. The three of them go for a walk as Ali reveals more plans for her agency. Cast Production In 2017, Paramount announced that it was fast- tracking a remake of the 2000 Nancy Meyers film What Women Want. On November 14, 2017, it was announced that Taraji P. Henson would star in the lead role. On February 2, 2018, Adam Shankman signed on to direct the film. Max Greenfield and Tracy Morgan were later added to the cast. Brian Tyler composed the music in the film. The soundtrack was released at Lakeshore Records.  Release  What Men Want was released on Digital HD on April 23, 2019 and on Blu-ray and DVD on May 7, 2019. Reception Box office What Men Want grossed $54.6 million in the United States and Canada and $17.6 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $72.2 million, against a production budget of $20 million. In the United States and Canada, What Men Want was released on February 8, 2019, alongside The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part, Cold Pursuit and The Prodigy, and was projected to gross $18–20 million from 2,912 theaters in its opening weekend. It made $6.6 million on its first day (including $1.25 million from Thursday night previews). It went on to debut to $19 million, finishing second behind The Lego Movie 2. In its second weekend, the film grossed $10.9 million, finishing fourth, and then $5.2 million in its third weekend, finishing sixth. Critical response On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 41% based on 143 reviews, and an average rating of 5.07/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Admittedly uneven but easy to like, What Men Want proves a gender-swapped remake can work – and the odds are substantially improved with Taraji P. Henson in the lead.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 49 out of 100, based on 29 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"A-\\" on an A+ to F scale, while those at PostTrak gave it an 82% overall positive score and a 69% \\"definite recommend.\\" The Hollywood Reporters Justin Lowe praised the film's pacing and jokes and said it featured a \\"predictably satisfying conclusion.\\" Writing for The Washington Post, Sonia Rao gave the film two out of four stars, calling it a \\"so-so gender-flipped remake\\" and praising Henson's performance, while adding, \\"It would make a perfectly fine airplane movie. Or maybe save it for the bachelorette party.\\" On February 26, 2020, the film was among the 26 films of 2019 awarded the ReFrame Stamp.

The surname Ard was first found in the historic county of Ayrshire (Gaelic: Siorrachd Inbhir Àir) in southwest Scotland, and the ancient Strathclyde-Briton people of the region, which today consists of the Council Areas of South, East, and North Ayrshire in the present-day region of Strathclyde, were the first to use the name. Retrieved 23 June 2018 The family likely came from the village near Hurlford in East Ayrshire, which would suggest that that location is likely the name's actual area of origin. Retrieved 23 June 2018 Until the gradual standardization of English spelling in the last few centuries, English lacked any comprehensive system of spelling. Medieval Scottish names, particularly as they were Anglicized from the original Gaelic, historically displayed wide variations in recorded spellings as scribes of the era spelled words according to how they sounded rather than any set of rules. This means that a person's name was often spelled several different ways over a lifetime. As such, different variations of the Ard surname usually have the same origin.

It is not a competitive antagonist of the estrogen receptor (ER) like conventional antiestrogens such as tamoxifen or fulvestrant; instead of binding to the ligand-binding site of the ER, ERX-11 interacts with a different part of the ERα and blocks protein–protein interactions of the ERα with coregulators that are necessary for the receptor to act and regulate gene expression. It was designed to bind to the coregulator binding region of the ERα and inhibit the ERα/coactivator interaction, although its precise binding site and mode of action have yet to be fully elucidated and understood. Nonetheless, it is clear that ERX-11 binds within the AF-2 domain of the ERα. ERX-11 is an orally active small-molecule tribenzamide compound which shows good antiestrogenic potency in vitro and minimal indications of toxicity in vivo in animals, even at doses much higher than the therapeutic doses. The compound mimics a nuclear receptor binding motif that appears to be critical for the interaction of the ERα with its coactivators. It is able to disrupt interactions between the ERα and 91 ERα-binding coregulators, including , , and . ERX-11 blocked estradiol-induced proliferation in 8 of 8 ER-positive breast cancer cell lines, with values ranging between 250 nM and 500 nM, and was as effective as tamoxifen and fulvestrant in inhibiting the growth of the ZR-75 and MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines. It was inactive in ER-negative breast cancer cell lines. In contrast to conventional antiestrogens like tamoxifen and fulvestrant, ERX-11 was found to block both ligand-dependent and ligand-independent ER signaling as well as ER signaling in both therapy- sensitive and therapy-resistant breast cancer cells. In addition, it disrupted interactions between the ERα and many ERα-binding coregulators not affected by conventional antiestrogens like tamoxifen (33 of 88 proteins, or 37.5%). It also induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells, unlike tamoxifen. Efforts are underway to assess ERX-11 in human clinical trials.

He is the director of several high-profile films, including Haytarma in 2013 and Another's Prayer in 2017. He has expressed opposition to the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation and his films about the fate of several prominent Crimean Tatars have been praised throughout Europe but criticized by the Russian far-right.  Early life  Seitablayev was born in 1972 in Yangiyo‘l, then part of the Uzbek SSR. His parents were deported to Uzbekistan in the Sürgün since Crimean Tatars were one numerous ethnic groups to experience en-mass exile in the Stalin era. He attended school in Uzbekistan and remained in there with his family until they moved back to Crimea during the Perestroika era in 1989, where he began his film career in 1992 after graduating from the Crimean Cultural Enlightenment School.  Career  From 1992 to 2004 he worked at the Simferopol State Crimean Tatar Theater, where he directed several plays including works of Alexander Pushkin. In 2005 he began working at the Kyiv Academic Theatre of Drama and Comedy on the left-bank of Dnieper. In 2009 he directed his first film, Quartet for Two. In 2013 he directed the movie Haytarma (English: Return) based on the real life of Amet- khan Sultan, a Crimean Tatar flying ace and twice Hero of the Soviet Union who witnessed the Sürgün but managed to avoid deportation due to his father's Lak ancestry and the intervention of Timofey Khryukin, commander of the 8th Air Army. The film was praised by the Kyiv Post as \\"must-see for history enthusiasts\\" and criticized by Komsomolskaya Pravda for depicting the NKVD officers doing the deportation as violent while portraying the deported women and children in a much more sympathetic light. Russian consul in Crimea Vladimir Andreev said the film was \\"distorting the truth\\", and attacked the movie for being made by Crimean Tatars, who he said deserved to be deported, but he admitted that he did not actually watch the film, and based his opinion that the movie was inaccurate only because it was made by Crimean Tatars. However, Andreev's orders telling Russians invited to the film to not attend resulted in several Russian generals invited to the premiere cancelling, though some still saw it. Andreev's comments sparked a huge backlash that led to his resignation, while Seitablayev jokingly thanked Andreev for giving the movie free advertising. In 2015, Seitablayev's family and film were featured in an Unreported World documentary about the Russian annexation of Crimea. From 2016 to 2017 he directed Another's Prayer, based on the real life of Saide Arifova, a kindergarten director who saved over 80 Jewish children during the Holocaust by switching their ethnicity listing and teaching them to imitate Crimean Tatar customs and language to hide them from the Gestapo. Eventually the Nazis suspected she was involved in hiding Jewish children and tortured her, but she refused to betray any names. After the Red Army retook control of Crimea she saved them again by explaining to the NKVD that the children were Jewish, not Crimean Tatar, and hence were allowed to stay in Crimea instead of being deported to the desert. The film debuted on 18 May 2017, the anniversary of the Sürgün. Originally the film was supposed to be filmed in Crimea, but after the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation in 2014 it was decided that the filming would be done in mainland Ukraine and Georgia.  Personal life  On 29 May 2018, he released a statement in support of Oleg Sentsov, a film director arrested in Russian-controlled Crimea. He is married to actress Ivanna Dyadyur, and has three children. His daughter Nazli is an actress, dancer, and model who also had a role in Haytarma.  Awards  * Order \\"For Merits\\" III degree - for significant personal contribution to state building, socio-economic, scientific and technical, cultural and educational development of Ukraine, significant labor achievements and high professionalism (August 24, 2017) * Laureate of the State Prize of Crimea - for the role of Macbeth in the play \\"McDuff\\" (\\"McDuff\\" - the name of Shakespeare's play \\"Macbeth\\" in the Crimean Tatar version). * Winner of the Kyiv Pectoral Theater Award for the role of Romeo in the play Romeo and Juliet. * Nariman Aliyev's Ukrainian film \\"Home\\" was recognized as the best foreign film 7th International Bosphorus Film Festival, and Akhtem Seitablaev, who starred in the film, received the award for best male role. * Winner of the Vasyl Stus Prize 2020.

The ensemble, which includes a paten, a chalice, and a straw, is currently on display at The Cloisters.  Description  In Catholicism, the Eucharist is a liturgical rite that is performed as a holy sacrament. In the course of the ceremony, bread and wine are consecrated and considered changed in substance into the body and blood of Christ and are then consumed by the participants. The ceremony is considered of great importance, and thus special items are made exclusively for use during the sacrament. These items are commonly made of valuable materials such as gold or silver, earthly elements strongly associated with Christ. The principal items used are a plate (called a paten) and a chalice; the paten holds the communion bread, while the chalice holds the wine.  Paten  The paten in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art dates to the late 13th century. The piece was likely made for the monastery of Saint Trudpert in Southern Germany. Made from gilded silver, the plate depicts four figures arranged in a four-pointed cross centered around a golden disc. At the top of the cross, Christ is depicted holding a chalice. On the sides of the cross, two figures from the Old Testament flank Christ; the priest-king Melchizedek to Christ's left, Abel to his right. Saint Trudpert is seen at the bottom of the cross, indicating that the patern was made for the monks of Saint Trudpert.  Chalice  The MET possess in its collection a chalice from Medieval Germany; as with the patern it is displayed with, the chalice is likely from the monastery of Saint Trudpert in Germany. The chalice, done in silver, gold, and niello, is intricately detailed and adorned with jewels. The chalice's relief metalwork depicts scenes from scenes from the New Testament and the Twelve Apostles.  Straw  The third item in the ensemble is a straw, also known as a fistula or calamus, used to sip the wine held by the chalice. Historically, a straw was needed to ensure that none of the consecrated wine was spilled during the Eucharist. Made from gilded silver, the straw features an intricate, vine-like grip made from silver and studded with gems. File:Paten MET DP366853.jpgThe paten, made from gilded silver.

It is now in the Louvre in Paris. It shows Louis IX of France wearing 16th century armour and a crown and holding his family symbol of a fleur de lys and the traditional sceptre of the kings of France. Gregorio Marañon and Manuel Bartolomé Cossío argue the model was a patient at the Hospital del Nuncio or an old print. Louis was the grandson of Alfonso VIII of Castile, meaning that in the late 16th century he was revered in both France and Spain, particularly since no Spanish king was canonised until Ferdinand III of Castile received the honour in 1671. The work was commissioned by Luis de Castilla, the painter's friend and future executor – the saint was also Luis' name saint. For a period the work was in the collection of the château de Chenonceau, before being acquired by its present owner in 1903. A recent restoration has revealed a cityscape in the background, showing Toledo.

Miller, 425 U.S. 435 (1976), was a United States Supreme Court that held that bank records are not subject to protection under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.United States v. Miller, . The case, along with Smith v. Maryland, established the principal of the third-party doctrine in relation to privacy rights. Background In 1973, sheriffs for Houston County, Georgia discovered an undocumented whiskey distillery, first by seizing a truck with distillery equipment and arresting its drivers, and later investigating a warehouse fire in the town of Kathleen and discovering distillery equipment there. They identified the warehouse property leaser as Mitch Miller of Georgia. The Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Bureau (ATF) of the United States Treasury Department, investigating the case, requested that local banks, holding Miller's accounts, provide all paperwork of his bank transactions to date via a grand jury subpoena duces tecum, rather than a warrant; the banks complied without notifying Miller. The financial records supported evidence that Miller had rented the truck, radio equipment, and sheet metal to support the distillery, and he and four others were charged with conspiracy (by selling tax-free whiskey), possession of distilled spirits, and possession of an unregistered still. The trial was held at the United States District Court for the Middle District of Georgia. During the defense, Miller attempted to prevent the bank records from being submitted as evidence, claiming these were illegally obtained, as such records should be protected from illegal search and seizure under the Fourth Amendment. The District Court rejected Miller's arguments, and resulted in a conviction with a sentence of three years in prison for Miller. Miller argued on the use of bank records as evidence to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, which reversed the District Court's findings. Miller had attempted to argue that the Bank Secrecy Act, which required banks to make microfilm copies of all checks they processed, was unconstitutional, the Firth Circuit recognized that the Supreme Court had validated the Act's constitutionality through California Bankers Ass'n v. Shultz,. but this did not allow for the types of actions that the ATF used. The Fifth Circuit cited Boyd v. United States for the proposition that \\"a compulsory production of a man's private papers to establish a criminal charge against him...is within the scope of the Fourth Amendment\\".. The court ruled that the Bank Secrecy Act did not overrule Fourth Amendment protections, and overturned the District Court's ruling.United States v. Miller, 500 F.2d 751 (5th Cir. 1974), rehearing denied, 508 F.2d 588 (5th Cir. 1975). Supreme Court The government petitioned the Supreme Court to hear their appeal, asking whether the privacy rights of the Fourth Amendment covered the method that the ATF had acquired the bank records. Oral arguments were presented on January 12, 1976, with a decision issued on April 21, 1976. The majority decision was given by Justice Lewis Powell, with all but Justices Brennan and Marshall joining, reversing the Fifth Circuit's decision. Powell determined that the bank records were not the private papers of Miller, but instead owned by the banks as part of its necessary business operations. Reiterating points made in California Bankers Ass'n v. Shultz, Powell stated that there is no expectation of privacy that a customer of a bank has when they do business through the bank, as checks, deposit slips and other paperwork are elements of commercial transactions. The Supreme Court remanded Miller's case back to the Fifth Circuit. Justice William J. Brennan Jr. dissented, identifying that a similar case, Burrows v. Superior Court,Burrows v. Superior Court, 13 Cal. 3d 238, 529 P.2d 590 (1974). had been decided in the California Supreme Court that ruled that bank records were protected under the Fourth Amendment, in a manner consistent with California Bankers Ass'n v. Shultz, which the Court could have used for this case. Justice Thurgood Marshall also dissented, reiterating his dissent from California Bankers Ass'n that he believed the Bank Secrecy Act was unconstitutional and would lead to violation of Fourth Amendment rights. Impact United States v. Miller, along with Smith v. Maryland,. which dealt with the privacy of telephone records, established the concept of a third-party doctrine that has been used by the courts to determine to what extent Fourth Amendment protection expectation of privacy covers. This doctrine generally finds that information that a person provides voluntarily to a third-party no longer is covered by expectation of privacy, and the government can obtain such information without a warrant.

After a debut at the Edinburgh International Film Festival, it was released on 29 June 2018 on Netflix. It also had a limited release in select Curzon Cinemas in the UK from 21 October to 16 November 2018. The film is set in Scotland and concerns incidents on a hunting trip to the remote Scottish Highlands, and stars Jack Lowden and Martin McCann. Plot An aggressive Edinburgh businessman, Marcus, takes his boarding-school friend, Vaughn, whose fiancée is newly pregnant, on a weekend hunting in the Scottish Highlands. Vaughn has never hunted before. They stay at a village pub, where they meet Logan, a community leader who bemoans the village's weak economy; and two young women, Kara and Iona. After dancing and drinking, Marcus leaves with Kara, despite being warned to stay away. Vaughn and Iona nearly kiss but Vaughn mentions his pregnant fiancée, so they have another drink instead. Early next morning, Marcus rouses a hungover Vaughn for their hunt. On the way, Vaughn deduces Marcus has used cocaine and chastises him. Vaughn realises he has forgotten ammunition for his rifle, so Marcus lets him borrow one of his guns, despite this violating the strict firearm laws. On the hunt, the pair happen upon a deer in a clearing, and Vaughn aims at a doe’s head; but it suddenly turns, causing Vaughn to shoot and kill a boy, unseen behind the deer. The boy's father arrives and, in a fit of grief, picks up Vaughn's gun and points it at him; but Marcus shoots the man. Vaughn wants to tell the police about the incident but Marcus convinces him they will be arrested as murderers. Marcus hides the bodies and they drive off, hoping to claim that they were hunting in another area. However, Marcus is told by a petrol station owner that Logan said no other hunters are around and convinces a traumatised Vaughn they can only protect themselves by returning after nightfall and burying the bodies. They return to the village and are invited to dinner by Logan and his brother Al; Logan asks if Marcus can help him find investors who might revitalise the community. At night, they bury the bodies. Marcus recovers the bullets, using a knife to dig Vaughn's bullet out of the boy's skull, over Vaughn's objections. They return just before dawn but are spotted by the B&B; owner's young son. The next day, their departure is thwarted when Brian, another of Logan's brothers, slashes their tyres and attacks Marcus for sleeping with Kara and giving her cocaine. At the garage, the mechanic tells Marcus the repairs will take a day. They return to the pub to hire a taxi, but find the driver drunk. On Logan's orders, Brian offers an aggressive and insincere apology, while complaining that the locals are beholden to \\"city twats\\" because they might bring in money. While Marcus is in the toilet, Vaughn speaks to Al and Iona and realises the deceased were Logan's nephew and brother-in-law. Al's suspicions are raised when Marcus, upon returning, asks about \\"them\\" despite having only heard that Logan's nephew was missing. Logan asks them to help with the search, which they accept for fear of arousing suspicion. A dog leads the party to the bodies. While the group dig them up, Marcus and Vaughn attempt to flee, but their fuel tank is ruptured by a bullet from Brian. Fleeing on foot, Vaughn stumbles and is injured by the dog, which Marcus stabs to death. As the group closes in, Marcus leaves Vaughn. Brian savagely beats Vaughn before being pulled off by Logan; the rest pursue Marcus. Logan and Brian take Vaughn to a farm, where he confesses. Brian wants to kill them but Logan, realising their deaths would be punished, insists on involving the police instead. Brian objects, claiming there is insufficient evidence and Vaughn will change his story to protect himself. As Brian moves to kill Vaughn, they hear the group has caught Marcus. Vaughn is locked in a guarded barn. The next morning, Logan gives Vaughn an ultimatum: he must kill Marcus, or Brian will kill them both. Vaughn refuses, even after being reminded of his fiancée and unborn child, and breaks down in tears. Eventually, at gunpoint, he kills Marcus. The locals hide Marcus's jeep and, before Vaughn's fiancée arrives, Logan instructs him to tell the police that Marcus drove north. Months later, an unnerved Vaughn wakes up to his crying child. He cradles him, but has a haunted look.

It was originally classified as a rubidgeine gorgonopsian, and would have been the first member of that clade from outside of Africa if that identification had been valid. However, it may instead be a combination of the tooth of a gorgonopsian and the braincase of a dicynodont, and may be a nomen dubium. History Leogorgon klimovensis was named in 2003 by the paleontologist Mikhail Ivakhnenko. The genus name honors the paleontologist Leonid Tatarinov. The holotype, PIN 4549/13, is a partial braincase from the Klimovo-1 locality in Vologda Oblast, Russia, and pertains to the Sokolki Faunal Assemblage. Ivakhnenko also referred an incisor tooth from the same locality to the new species. He interpreted the fossils as representing a large rubidgeine gorgonopsian, the first found outside of Africa, and noted that it was especially similar to Dinogorgon. In 2008, however, Ivakhnenko noted that, due to its poorly known anatomy, Leogorgon could be a relative of the Russian Phthinosuchidae rather than the sole Russian representative of Rubidgeinae. In 2016, a rubidgeine identity was formally rejected by paleontologist Christian Kammerer, as the features which Ivakhnenko stated supported its assignment to Rubidgeinae are actually present in other gorgonopsians, and in fact the braincase has no uniquely gorgonopsian features at all and may be from a dicynodont. The referred incisor is from a gorgonopsian, but cannot be distinguished from incisors of the contemporaneous Inostrancevia. Recent evidence suggests that African gorgonopsians form an endemic group.

The bridge connects the Mozambican capital Maputo, on the northern bank, with its disjunct suburb of Katembe on the southern bank. Construction work began in 2014 and the bridge officially opened November 10, 2018. The construction work was carried out by the Chinese China Road and Bridge Corporation; a large part of the project is financed by loans from the Chinese Exim Bank. The bridge is the longest suspension bridge on the African continent, replacing the Matadi Bridge, completed in 1983 in the Democratic Republic of Congo, for this distinction.  History  Completed bridge piers of the bridge under construction between Maputo and Katembe (view of the southern bank of Katembe; September 2016) The idea of a bridge over the Bay of Maputo – analogous to 25 Abril bridge over the Tagus in Lisbon – had already been planned for many years. In 1989, the World Bank financed the urbanisation plan for Maputo, which included the construction of a bridge. It was only thanks to the end of the civil war, the numerous investments in the course of the gas and oil boom and the associated strong economic upturn in Mozambique that the Mozambican government was able to tackle the project. The government opened an expression of interest procedure in November 2008. Following a visit by the then Portuguese Prime Minister José Sócrates in 2010, financing by the Portuguese state was originally planned. However, due to the country's massive financial and budgetary crisis, the commitment could not be fulfilled. After a visit by Mozambican President Armando Guebuza to the People's Republic of China in August 2011, both countries agreed on financing of the project by China. The construction work is being commissioned by the state-owned development company Maputo Sul, which is also responsible for the construction of the ring road. The construction itself will be carried out by the Chinese building and civil engineering group China Road and Bridge Corporation. According to China Daily, up to 2000 jobs are to be created. The German engineering company GAUFF Engineering advises on construction supervision. The first preparatory construction work began in June 2014 After some delays – especially in the resettlement of residents in the Maputo neighborhood of Malanga – the bridge was inaugurated on 2018-11-15.  Description of the construction  Construction work on the northern part of the bridge (September 2017) The four-lane suspension bridge is 3041 metres long and crosses the bay at a height of 60 metres. The northern viaduct (foreland bridge) is 1097 meters long, approximately S-shaped and is connected to the Praça 16 de Junho roundabout (connected to the EN1/EN2/EN4 highways) in the Maputo neighborhood of Malanga. The southern viaduct is 1264 meters long and consists of precast elements. It is directly connected to the road to Ponta do Ouro. Originally, pylons were also planned in the bay itself, but they were removed after a change of plan so as not to unnecessarily obstruct shipping traffic. A span of 680 metres is bridged without pillars between the two pylons located on the banks. This makes the bridge the largest of its kind in Africa. The main supporting cables are each connected to a solid anchor block via steel structures in the north and south. The extremely high loads of the structure required pile foundations with diameters of 1.50 m to 2.20 m. The piles reach 110 m deep into the claystone. The two pylons are 141 m high, and at a height of about 40 meters there is a crossbar for the roadway. The individual prefabricated steel elements for the carriageway are 25.60 m wide and 12 m long. These were fabricated in China and installed from a ship lying near the quay wall. The project also included the extension of the road from Katembe to the border town of Ponta do Ouro (129 kilometres) and between Boane and Bela Vista (63 kilometres), including bridges over the Maputo, Futi and Umbelúzi rivers. After completing the bridge, extending the EN1 trunk road over the bridge to [Ponta do Ouro] was possible.  Costs  The costs are expected to amount to about 726 million US dollars, of which 85 percent (681.6 million US dollars) will be financed by special loans from the Chinese Exim Bank. These have a term of 20 years at an interest rate of four percent. Another 10 percent (US$72.5 million) will be awarded on other terms via the Exim Bank, 5 percent will be borne directly by the Mozambican state.  Impact  Previously, the direct (and fastest) connection was the ferry of the state shipping company Transmarítimo Previously, the road between Katembe and Boane to Ponta do Ouro was not asphalted, and could become impassable, especially in the rainy season. Although Katembe belongs to the city of Maputo, the spatial separation of the two parts has an immense impact. While Maputo, especially the city centre, is heavily urbanised and has a good two million inhabitants on the north bank of the city, most of the buildings on the south side are one-storeyed, the roads are unpaved and there is a lot of undeveloped space. An estimated 15,000 to 20,000 people currently live in Katembe. The transport takes place between both shores either by car and passenger ferry or via another detour via Boane (main roads EN2/EN200). With the completion of the bridge and the extension of the road to Ponta do Ouro, a massive population growth of up to 400,000 inhabitants is forecasted for Katembe. The entire southern shore is also to be urbanised. According to the strategic plan for the urbanization of Katembe by the engineering office Betar, approximately 9,510,000 square meters (and thus 58.9 percent of the total area) are to be reserved for residential buildings. 3,270,000 square meters (20.3 percent of the total area) are earmarked for the service sector, 1,880,000 square meters (11.7 percent) for industry. The extension of the road to Ponta do Ouro and KwaZulu-Natal (South Africa) is intended to massively shorten the travel time. A joint tourism plan with the South African province of KwaZulu-Natal and the Kingdom of Swaziland aims to attract more visitors to southern Mozambique.  Criticism  The high costs of building the bridge and the connected road to Boane and Ponta do Ouro have been massively criticised by Mozambican publicist Carlos Nuno Castel-Branco. In his opinion, the bridge would cost a seventh of the money if it were built in China. Former mayor of Maputo, Eneas Comiche, also criticizes the high costs. Scientist Américo Matavele pointed out that Castel-Branco did not take into account the costs of the connected roads in his invoices. According to an analysis report by the Economist Intelligence Unit, an analysis company of The Economist Group, interest rates on the loans of the Chinese Exim Bank are also relatively high. The Mozambican government prefers these, although it has far more favourable financing options at its disposal. The criticism of the bridge construction project is illustrated. In early November 2014, numerous Mozambican workers went on strike for several days. They complained about poor working conditions, wrong contracts and late salary payments. Furthermore, numerous families are affected by resettlements in the course of the construction project. The contractor Maputo Sul estimates the number of families to be relocated at 920, for which new four-storey houses with two to four-room apartments are to be built as a replacement. Resettlements began in 2015.  Awards  The bridge has received worldwide attention and recognition in specialist circles. In addition to the FULTON Award 2017 and 2019 - the highest distinction for concrete structures in the southern states of Africa - in June 2019 in New York the bridge was also awarded the \\"Award of Merit\\" of the Engineering News-Record (ENR) as winner in the category \\"Global Best Projects\\".

One of his watches was presented to Lord Nelson who was wearing it when he was killed by a sniper at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. Others were made for George III. Biography Emery set up as a watch and clock maker at Cockspur Street, Charing Cross, London. He arrived in England from Geneva in the Republic of Geneva. He was made an honorary member of the London Clockmakers Company. He made good quality cylinder watches and used the pivoted detent escapement. Thomas Mudge had invented the lever escapement in around 1755, giving timepieces their characteristic ‘tick-tock’ sound. Emery was the first watchmaker to use lever escapement and made some improvements.  Family  Josiah Emery married Anne Jacob (1739-1769) on 4 July 1762 at St Martin in the Fields, Westminster. He had signed the marriage license and its bond on 1 July as 2Josias Emery, of the parish of St Ann [Soho, Westminster], watchmaker, bachelor, age 30.\\" Through this first marriage Emery was connected to Westminster-based goldsmiths, jewellers, watchcase makers, and clockmakers, several of them Huguenot or of Huguenot descent. Emery’s wife Anne Jacob was the eldest daughter of Jean Jacob (1709-1787), also known as John Jacob, a Huguenot goldsmith who had arrived in London c.1732. Jean Jacob’s wife, Emery’s mother- in-law, was Anne Courtauld (1709-1793), eldest daughter of Augustin Courtauld (1686-1751) the Huguenot goldsmith of St Martin’s Lane in Westminster, and ancestor of the Courtauld family of textile and art collection fame. Emery’s aunt by marriage, Esther Courtauld (1711-1763), Augustin’s second daughter, had married Etienne/Stephen Goujon (1696-1778), also of Huguenot descent and an eminent watchcase maker in Gerard Street, Westminster. Emery’s sister-in- law Judith Jacob married in 1767 George Cowles, also goldsmith, originally from Gloucester, who had been apprenticed in 1751 to Anne and Judith’s uncle Samuel Courtauld (1720-1765), goldsmith, with premises in Cornhill opposite the Royal Exchange in the City of London. In 1765, George Cowles went into partnership with Samuel’s widow Louisa Perina Courtauld née Ogier (Louisa Courtauld) after Samuel’s sudden death age 44. The Louisa Courtauld & George Cowles partnership lasted until 1777, by which time Samuel junior was 25. Emery was also related by marriage, a little more distantly, to Thomas Johnson (c.1727-1775), clockmaker of Grays Inn Passage, who had married Anne Courtauld’s first cousin Anne Bardin (1717-1761). Thomas and Anne’s only surviving son John Johnson (1757-1800) became a clockmaker at the same premises in Grays Inn Passage after his father’s early death.  Residence and premises  Josiah’s premises on Cockspur Street are recorded in Westminster Rate Books and Land Tax Records 1767-1791, and he served on the parish coroner’s inquest jury on occasions in 1771, 1773, 1777 and 1780. The precise address on Cockspur Street is recorded variously at no.2, no.3, no.33 and facing Pall Mall. His brother—in-law Denis Jacob, jeweller and Anne’s half brother, had his premises at 37 Cockspur Street, and the coroner’s inquest into the death of Denis’ wife at home in Nov 1777, refers to the Emerys being the next door neighbours of the Jacobs. There are no records for Josiah Emery in Westminster after 1791.  Death  Josiah Emery died in Chelsea on 2 July 1794, leaving a very short Will written the same day and in French, his mother tongue, leaving all his estate to his second wife Susanna (née Smith b.1746) except £10 to his unmarried and only surviving child Elizabeth. Josiah was buried in the Jacob family vault in St Martin in the Fields Westminster on 7 July 1794, on the same day and together with his niece Mary Jacob, last surviving child of his brother-in-law Augustin Jacob. Louis Recordon took over the business at 33 Cockspur Street in 1797.  Daughter  Emery’s only surviving child was his daughter Elizabeth b.1765 by his first wife Anne Jacob. Elizabeth married William Reynolds in 1810. We glimpse that Elizabeth was a woman of learning and interested in history. Her uncle Augustin Jacob died with no surviving issue in 1811, sharing his considerable estate between his two surviving siblings and 10 nephews and nieces. To Elizabeth he left family portraits, and most of his book collection, including his books in French: Martin’s French Bible, the French Book of Common Prayer as published 1678, and four volumes of ‘Gil Blas’, and others; also history books in English: Plutarch’s Lives, Josephus’ Jewish Wars, a “Miscellaneous History from the Creation of the World to William the Conqueror”, as well as Chambers Dictionary in 2 folios, a Biographical Dictionary and others.

Yow became known on social media as style influencer Andrea Chong's Instagram photographer since 2015. He has accrued more than 100,000 followers on Instagram as of June 2018. Plagiarism scandal Yow gained widespread media attention in June 2018 after some of the images on his Instagram account and personal website were discovered to be edited or composited photos made from stock images, or from images found on sites such as Pinterest and Reddit. Acting on a tip-off, Singapore-based news site Mothership.sg broke the story on 20 June, providing, in two articles, 21 examples of plagiarised photos, together with their originals, including 10 examples in which Yow was digitally added onto the scene. Many photographs carried captions implying authorship, such as \\"Hours well spent waiting for this!\\"; one photograph was claimed to be taken with a Sony camera that Yow was engaged to advertise. The revelations provoked a strong response from members in the local photography and blogging communities, such as Xiaxue and Mrbrown, who condemned Yow for misleading his audience. In response to the allegations of plagiarism, Yow claimed that the image rights have been purchased and that his commercial clients were aware that stock images were used in the collaborative social media posts. He also defended the captions on his Instagram posts, saying he had never claimed that they \\"were taken live at the scene depicted\\". Sony Singapore and Uniqlo have declined to comment on whether they were aware of the stock image usage. Subsequent to the widespread circulation of the story, on 21 June, Yow removed all images from his Instagram feed and issued a statement in which he apologised for making use of others' photographs and misleading his followers with false captions. He maintained that the \\"end-products\\" of his collaborations with his friends \\"remained honest and fair\\". On social media, the Daryl Aiden Challenge emerged, which entailed digitally adding oneself into the scene depicted by a stock photo. Corporate brands such as the budget airline Scoot, F&N; Seasons and Shopee, and bloggers like Xiaxue updated their social media accounts with posts parodying the incident. The media attention in June allowed Yow to gain greater popularity and thousands of additional followers by the time he resumed uploading posts to his Instagram feed on 14 September. Yow's first post after the hiatus featured an image of burning prints of the plagiarised photos being thrown into the air. In the same post and in disappearing stories, behind-the-scene videos and photos of the shoot were posted, demonstrating the veracity of the images. Behind-the-scenes material continued to be included for many of Yow's subsequent posts.

Its residents were mostly African American, African Caribbean, and Puerto Rican, and comprised one of the largest black communities in New York before World War I. San Juan Hill was bound by 59th Street to the south, West End Avenue to the west, 65th Street to the north, and Amsterdam Avenue (part of Tenth Avenue) to the east. The site is now occupied by Lincoln Center, a complex dedicated to the performing arts. Etymology There are different opinions as to why the area was called San Juan Hill. Some critics say that it refers to the Spanish–American War of 1898 fought in Cuba. It is also said that it was because African-American veterans from the war lived in the area. Others say that the name was given to the area due to the constant racial gang fights between African-Americans and Irish-American gangs. History African Americans moved into the area around the late 19th century from Greenwich Village, where an earlier black community existed. Before the construction of Lincoln Center and the subsequent destruction of San Juan Hill, jazz and art thrived in this area as its popularity began to grow. The neighborhood had a jazz club called \\"Jungle Cafe\\" nicknamed the jungle by the members of the neighborhood. This term was used by Milton Mezz Mezzrow, a white jazz clarinetist. Mezzrow was introduced to jazz while living in Harlem, where he heard recordings of James P. Johnson, the pianist from San Juan Hill in which he said \\"Here’s a boy from the Jungles who makes all the other piano players look sick!” Moreover, this basement club was where Charleston was reputedly born and got its start. The area's musical history continues today at Jazz at Lincoln Center. Historian Marcy S. Sacks writes that San Juan Hill had many tenement basement clubs ranging from dives to higher-level clubs. And that there were also poolrooms, saloons, dance halls, and bordellos. San Juan Hill had many black churches that, according to historian Marcy Sacks, moved into the area around the 1880s and 1890s. Among these were St. Mark's Methodist Episcopal, Mt. Olivet Baptist, as well as St. Benedict the Moor Church in neighboring Hell's Kitchen. The area had numerous community and fraternal organizations, such as the Grand United Order of Odd Fellows, Negro Elks, and the Colored Freemasons. This community also attracted war veterans returning from the Spanish- American War of 1898 which could have given rise to its name. Aerial view of the construction of Lincoln Center and demolition of San Juan Hill, 1962 Displacement San Juan Hill was mostly erased due to 20th century sweep of \\"urban renewal\\" to create Lincoln Center, displacing thousands of families, and leaving a number of people never to know the neighborhood existed. In the early 20th century African Americans started to move from San Juan Hill to Harlem. The black population decreased while the Puerto Rican population grew. More Puerto Rican families started moving there in the 1950s coinciding with a massive influx of Puerto Rican migration after World War II. In the 1940s the neighborhood of San Juan Hill was designated as a slum and called \\"the worst slum district of New York City\\" by the New York City Housing Authority. In 1947, the City of New York made San Juan Hill an area for redevelopment. Parts of San Juan Hill, from 61st to 64th Streets along Amsterdam to West End Avenues were demolished in 1947, and the Amsterdam Houses were completed in 1948. More than 1,100 families, mostly black and Puerto Rican, were evicted to build the Amsterdam Houses. During this time, the displacement of more than 7,000 lower-class families and 800 businesses happened, mainly being due to the price increase regarding the renewal process of clearing up the slums. Although 4,400 new housing units were intended for future residents. The rent of rooms after the urban renewal project took place would range from $40-$50 a room, which was too high for the original residents. However, few tenement houses still stand today, one exception being Phipps Houses on 63rd Street. The buildings make up the oldest affordable housing units that led to the move of the working class and quality of life that was rare for the people of color during this time. Moreover, Roseanna Weston, a resident of San Juan Hill who lived in this housing said that she remembered that before living in Phipps houses, her family lived in a run-down tenement. Known as the ideal tenement, it was one of the last tenement buildings left standing after the demolition of San Juan Hill. Declaring the area of San Juan Hill a slum later became the first step in a city redevelopment project in the name of urban renewal. Robert Moses, a developer and chairmen of Committee on Slum Clearance and leader of such destructive urban renewal projects throughout most of the 1950s and 1960s, used a federal program to claim the land in the area of San Juan Hill under eminent domain. This law was Title I of the 1949 Housing Act, giving federal backing for urban renewal projects. These projects created middle-class housing while displacing lower-income families, and made room to create Lincoln Center. This post-WWII transformation of San Juan Hill neighborhood is said to have been an early example of urban gentrification. In the 1950s, the neighborhood was almost completely torn down and Lincoln Center was built. The land was obtained by Moses using eminent domain turned a multi-ethnic community into an elite cultural venue, unaffordable to the families he displaced. By 1955, Robert Moses struck a deal with the Met Opera to develop the neighborhood north of Columbus Circle into a home for the arts. Other organizations such as Fordham University, the New York Philharmonic, and the Juilliard School of Music soon followed suit moved their headquarters and campuses to the center. The area had been the home of over 17,000 residents. Construction on the development project started in 1959. Legacy Lincoln Center in 2010 San Juan Hill was known as the birthplace of the Charleston and Bebop. Today, Lincoln Center is the home of the New York City Opera, New York Philharmonic, New York City Ballet, and the Metropolitan Opera. Location work for the film West Side Story (1961) used parts of San Juan Hill following the condemning of the neighborhood's buildings; piles of debris from recently demolished buildings feature in many shots. Notable residents Thelonious Monk in 1947 Thelonious Monk, the jazz pianist, grew up in San Juan Hill, raised in the Phipps houses on West 63rd street. A portion of a street in the old San Juan Hill neighborhood was named after Thelonious Monk. After his death, Monk's family created the Thelonious Monk Foundation to help improve music education throughout the United States. Jazz pianist Herbie Nichols was also born in the neighborhood, and became a friend of Monk later in life. Pianist James P. Johnson, one of the pioneers of the stride style of piano playing family moved to San Juan Hill in 1908. Johnson composed the Roaring Twenties popular song \\"Charleston\\". Notable historian Arturo Schomburg, of the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, lived in San Juan Hill with his first wife and 3 sons. Barbara Hillary the first African-American woman to reach the North Pole, and then the first African-American woman to reach the South Pole, and therein the first African American woman to have reached both poles, was born in the neighborhood.https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/barbara-hillary-1st- black-woman-at-north-south-poles-dies/2221012/ References External links * WEEKEND HISTORY: San Juan Hill Category:History of New York City Category:Populated places established by African Americans Category:African- American history in New York City Category:Former New York City neighborhoods Category:Neighborhoods in Manhattan ","title":"San Juan Hill, Manhattan"},{"id":"57741643","text":"Ann O'Dea is an Irish businesswoman, the co-founder and CEO of Silicon Republic and the CEO of Inspirefest.

It was built between 1823 and 1844. It is also known as Wellington Convict and Mission Site - Maynggu Ganai, Wellington Valley Settlement, Wellington Aboriginal Mission and Government Farm Site. The property was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 22 March 2011.  History  Wellington was founded as a convict agricultural station in 1823, the only Government settlement after Bathurst, west of the Blue Mountains. In 1827 \\"special\\" convicts, i.e. middle class or educated convicts who were thought to be receiving special attention were removed to Wellington to keep them out of sight. By 1831 convicts had erected buildings for the Commandant, military, stores, engineers, blacksmiths, carpenters, government officials and the convicts as well as structures such as a lime kiln and stockyards. From 1825, the settlement also housed the Police Magistrate, several constables and the Mounted Police. In 1831 the convict agricultural station ceased operation leaving behind only a small military presence. The London-based Church Mission Society moved into the settlement to create an Aboriginal mission. The mission was originally attended by two couples Rev William Watson and his wife Ann, who were the first appointed to this position by the London-based office, and Rev Johann Handt, a German missionary with experience in Liberia, and his wife Mary Crook, eldest daughter of the renown South Seas missionary, William Pascoe Cook. The missionaries abandoned the settlement in 1844. The Wellington Valley Settlement Site is located in the valley formed by the junction of the Bell and Macquarie rivers. The original inhabitants of this land are the Wiradjuri people here referred to as the Wellington Wiradjuri. The ethnological and archaeological evidence discussed in the Conservation Management Plan for the Maynggu Ganai Historic Site by Griffin NRM shows that there is considerable evidence of the Wellington Wiradjuri's relationship with the land, which includes the Settlement Site, prior to the arrival of Europeans. The journals kept by the missionaries show that the cultural and material practices of the Indigenous inhabitants were continued after the European settlement was established. In the 1820s settlement by Europeans at Bathurst grew rapidly, the population increased dramatically along with the amount of land occupied and cleared. This caused tensions between Aboriginal people and the colonists, with Governor Brisbane declaring martial law for a period in 1824. Wellington Valley was at this time considered to be the outer limits of the colonial frontier. There was no official settlement in the area apart from some unofficial grazing. A government presence was established at Wellington Valley to provide a secure outpost for further settlement and growth of the colony. The valley was occupied as a convict agricultural station in 1823. Lieutenant Percy Simpson was put in command of establishing the settlement and within three years had cultivated of land and constructed 40 buildings with the labour of 80 convicts. From 1926 the colonial government began winding back the numbers of convicts sent to Wellington with a view to reducing the overall scale of the settlement. This changed when in 1827 the settlement became the destination for difficult convicts or \\"specials\\". The treatment of middle or upper class convicts had been of concern to the colonial administration for some time. There was unease that these convicts were given preferential treatment that did not reflect their criminal status. It was recommended by Commissioner Bigge that they be given light work and banished from the centres of population. From 1827 these \\"special\\" convicts were sent to Superintendent John Maxwell at the Wellington Valley Settlement. One of the Overseers at the settlement, George Brown, was convicted of the murder of a seven year old Aboriginal girl. Governor Darling insisted Brown be tried: \\"the natives should be satisfied that whites are made answerable for every outrage committed against them.\\" This was an early instance in Colonial Law where the rights of Aboriginal people were upheld. By 1830 the settlement was becoming \\"costly and unproductive.\\" There were very few convicts remaining at the settlement and the agriculture station finally ceased operation in December 1830. By comparison with other penal settlements such as Port Macquarie, Moreton Bay or Norfolk Island; Wellington was a small enterprise which had minimal support from the Colonial Office. It was established exclusively as an agricultural enterprise (albeit on a small scale) on the inland frontier of the colony, whereas all the others were on the coast. Part of the settlement continued to be used by the government for military use in order to defend the frontier and provide security in the area. The rest of the settlement was given to the Anglican (London) Church Missionary Society. Augustus Earle, an artist, visited the site in 1826 as part of his travels with the Beagle. He painted Aboriginal people, the Wellington Caves, Government House and the Wellington area. Conrad Martens sketched and painted scenes around Wellington in late 1820s and early 1830s. Missionaries The first missionary sent to Wellington Valley was John Harper who previously worked at the Blacktown Native Institution. Harper spent 1825 and 1826 at the settlement and published reports about his interactions with the Aboriginal population in the Sydney Gazette. These accounts are the earliest written record of Aboriginal society in this area. The Secretary of State for the Colonies invited the Church Missionary Society (CMS) to establish a mission for Aboriginal people, giving assurances that it would be supported from public funds. Governor Bourke obtained funding from the Legislative Council and gave the Church Missionary Society permission to occupy the Government buildings in the Wellington Valley convict settlement, forming the Wellington Valley Mission, one of the earliest to \\"Civilize and Christianize\\" Aboriginal people in Australia. The Rev William Watson, a member of the Church of England, and the Rev Johann Simon Christian Handt, a Lutheran minister, together with their wives, arrived in the Wellington Valley on 3 October 1832. They were granted and ₤500 per annum to run the mission. The cost of transporting supplies from Bathurst or Sydney was extremely high and as local supplies would reduce the cost, crops of wheat and maize were planted and stock including sheep, cattle and pigs were grazed. Rev Watson became known to Aboriginal people as \\"Eaglehawk\\" as he a reputation for kidnapping or removing Aboriginal children to the Mission. A drought in the early days made it almost impossible to provide enough food for the mission. On Saturday 2 March 1833 Watson recorded the following in his journal. \\"Our men attempted to plow [sic], but broke the coulter [blade] immediately owing to the ground being so dry and hard. We have had very little rain for a long time. Our garden and indeed vegetation in general is almost parched up. Scarcely any food for the cattle.\\" By 1835 the mission station showed prosperity but little evidence of spiritual advancement. There was a growing uneasiness about the effectiveness of the mission and evidence of conflict with the settlers, the judiciary and between the missionaries themselves. In 1837 Handt moved away because of his wife's poor health and was replaced by James Günther who also fought with Watson. William Porter worked as the Agriculturalist from 1838-42, but was later found to have acted inappropriately towards some of the Aboriginal women around the mission. Watson attempted to gain control of any Aboriginal children he could get his hands on, gaining a reputation as an eagle hawk, and kidnapper among the Aboriginal women. Eventually Watson left Wellington Valley and, taking the children with him, established a new mission called Apsley. In 1839 the Church Missionary Society decided that the Rev Watson should be removed. Watson went ahead to establish a more successful private mission about four miles from the settlement on the Macquarie River (Apsley Mission). The Rev Gunther continued to operate the mission at the settlement but his annual reports of 1841 and 1842 showed little hope for the success of the venture. The Church Missionary Society withdrew its support and after a personal inspection by Governor Gipps, the Mission Station at Wellington Valley was closed in 1844.  Description  The Wellington Convict and Mission Site is located south of the town of Wellington, it is on the slope of the hills facing to the west. The site is an archaeological site which is located under paddocks, roads and various urban development such as the western portion of land to Mitchell Highway (Curtis Street) which is partially covered by backyards, houses and fences. There are no standing buildings or ruins from the convict or mission occupation. The most important building, Government House, was located on the brow of the hill looking out across the Bell River and the valley. The soil of the site is red clay loam of basaltic origin with a covering of weeds. There are a number of Kurrajong and Ironbark trees on the slopes and on the brow of the hill. There is little other vegetation. The possible foundations of a number of the original buildings have been tentatively located and identified from the maps of the period and the descriptions of the site given in journals and in reports to the Government and the Colonial Office. Remnants of the settlement include: Government House foundations, about under the soil and river pebbles at the site on Lot 1 DP 120160; remains of a blue granite path on Lot 58; foundations of two military barracks;No 1 on Lot 1, DP 129997 and No 2 on Lot 355 foundations of two mud huts on Lot 355; three dumps of original handmade bricks at the site of Government House on Lot 1, under trees on Lot 58 and on Lot 50; and Artefactual material (including horseshoes and lengths of chain) which may date from the settlement. Pioneer Cemetery located on Lot 7018 of DP 1020768 also forms part of the subject site. The cemetery was established by the first commander of the convict station, Lieutenant Percy Simpson, away from the convict settlement. The earliest burial dates from 1825. The cemetery reportedly contains burials of Aboriginal people from the missionary period of the site, along with former missionaries Reverend Watson, his wife Anne and their infant child.  Condition  As at 4 October 2001, Lots 49-50, 56, 58-59 of DP 756920, Lots 1-2 of DP 129997, Lot 1 of DP 405152 and Lot 1 of DP 120160 have been used mainly for agricultural purposes and are relatively undeveloped. Archaeological relics and deposits (such as the remains of walls, fences, wells, rubbish pits and privies) relating to the early convict station and mission, may be present on these lots. Agricultural activities (ploughing for example) are likely to have disturbed archaeological material located in the upper layers of the soil, on some of these sites. The Maynggu Ganai Historic Site CMP indicates that there has been some displacement of artefactual material as a result of erosion. Lots 1-4 of DP 156995, Lots 361-362 of DP 578699, Lot 355 of DP 531300, Lot 216 of DP 756920 and part Lot 324 DP 43505 have been substantially disturbed by later development which includes residences and associated structures, industrial and agricultural buildings. As a result of this development and associated landscaping activities, archaeological material present on these sites is likely to be have removed or be found in a disturbed context. Cypress and Watson Avenue, Wheelers Lane and the Mitchell Highway run through the Wellington Convict and Mission Site. Archaeological relics and deposits may lie under these roads. Road works will have disturbed archaeological material in the upper layers of the soil but deeper deposits may be intact. Archaeological evidence has been previously identified on a triangle of land between the Mitchell Highway and the Old Bathurst Road alignment has had located on this site. The site has a high degree of integrity as a large portion of the site has never been built on. Areas that do have built structures are one phase buildings as their location on the outskirts of a rural town has alleviated any pressure for development.  Modifications and dates  The mission settlement was abandoned in 1844. Following the closure of the mission, the settlement buildings were dismantled for their bricks another materials useful to the residents of Wellington and surrounds.  Heritage listing  As at 12 November 2010, Wellington Convict and Mission Site - Maynggu Ganai is a rare cultural landscape with extensive archaeological evidence of the second colonial outpost established on the frontier west of the Blue Mountains. It was established in the 1820s as a convict agricultural station and by 1827 had become a destination for educated or middle class convicts or \\"specials\\". The place was the centre of ongoing first contact between the Wiradjuri and the British settlers. The contact between the two cultures and the way each subsequently evolved is part of the physical history of the place. Occurring on the frontier of the colony the settlement made possible subsequent pastoral expansion. It has the potential to provide rare physical evidence of the way of life at a remote rural convict settlement. The place has very high potential to reveal new information about an inland convict agricultural station; providing material for comparative analysis of later sites. The convict station later became the first inland Aboriginal mission in Australia and is an early example of the forced institutionalisation of Aboriginal children. The place is of high social and cultural significance to the Wellington Wiradjuri in particular the descendants of those associated with the Mission. The place has social significance for its role as the original Wellington settlement and it plays an important role in defining the cultural identity of the town of Wellington. Wellington Convict and Mission Site was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 22 March 2011 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Wellington Convict and Mission Precinct is historically significant as the site of the first ongoing contact between British colonists and the Wellington Wiradjuri. The settlement occurred on the frontier of the colony and made possible subsequent pastoral expansion. The place is historically significant as a remote convict agricultural station for difficult and \\"educated\\" convicts. It provides rare physical evidence of the way of life at a rural convict settlement. The murder of an Aboriginal girl by Overseer Brown and the 1927-28 court case is important evidence of early application of colonial law in relation to Aboriginal people. The Wellington mission was the first inland mission in Australia and the first of a series of missions around Wellington. The mission archives are in themselves highly significant due to the record of the Wiradjuri culture made by the missionaries, including a record of the Wiradjuri languages. The Wellington mission is historically an early example of the forced removal of Aboriginal children from their families. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The Wellington Convict and Mission Site is historically associated with the Indigenous people of the Wellington Valley (Wiradjuri) for whom the place was a site of prolonged first contact with the colonists. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The Wellington Convict and Mission Site's cultural landscape has some aesthetic value associated with its location on hills overlooking the Bell River and the surrounding mountain peaks and ranges. The landscape is a relatively intact rural colonial landscape which has had minimal change since it was depicted by Augustus Earle in 1826. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Wellington Convict and Mission Site - Maynggu Ganai, is of social and cultural significance to the community of Wellington and the wider Indigenous community. Descendants from the original Wellington Wiradjuri have an association with the place, particularly through the descendants of those associated with the Mission. To the Wellington community the place plays an important role in defining the cultural identity of the town of Wellington, as the place where the town originated. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The archaeological remains and documentary evidence relating to the Wellington Convict and Mission Site have the potential to contribute new knowledge about the past of Wellington, and about the history of culture contact, convictism and missions in Australia and in the broader colonial world. The place has very high potential to reveal information that may not be available from other sources. Whilst the written records for the site are extensive and refer to at least 40 buildings, the entire settlement may have had many more structures which can only be found through further archaeological investigation. Existing documentary research is reasonably extensive however the physical evidence of the place has never been fully investigated. The archaeology of the Wellington Convict and Mission Site is likely to reveal otherwise unknown information about rural convicts and cultural exchange between the Wiradjuri and colonists on the frontier. The Wellington mission is one of the earliest mission sites and is likely to be the most intact archaeological site of the early missions. The place has the potential to provide new understanding on the convict agricultural station and early colonial trade and exchange; providing material for comparative analysis of later sites. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Wellington Convict and Mission Precinct is a rare archaeological site. The site was originally a convict agricultural station from 1823 and an Aboriginal mission until 1845. It has the potential to provide rare physical evidence of a convict agricultural station providing a unique opportunity to understand the rural convict. The site also has the potential to provide the earliest surviving physical evidence of an Aboriginal mission, other than Blacktown Native Institution. The Wellington Convict and Mission site was the location of the first Anglican mission and the first inland mission in Australia. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.

The school was established in 1947 when Russia was part of the USSR and is named after Aleksandr Vasilyevich Fedotov, a test pilot who was killed in an aircraft crash in the 1980s.  History  The school was established in 1947 at the Soviet Union's Gromov Flight Research Institute in Zhukovsky near Moscow, to train personnel involved in conducting test flights primarily within the Russian aviation industry. They underwent theoretical and practical training to allow safe and effective flight testing of the aircraft and on- board equipment. Initially there were three departments: for training test pilots for fixed-wing and rotary wing aircraft; and air navigators to be employed by the Soviet design bureaus (OKB), research institutes (like GFRI, etc.) and production plants. Later, with completion of the initial training schedules, such separation became less formalized. There also were special classes for training test pilots to serve as civil aviation research and testing personnel working for the GosNII GA. The school is named after Aleksandr Vasilyevich Fedotov. The school was named in 1984 after Fedotov died in a test flight accident that year. Alexandr Krutov, then chief of the school, told in his interview (2018) that in the Soviet times the school trainee were selected mostly in the Air Force. The flight service department at the ministry of aviation industry knew how many test pilots would be needed for the entire industry. When pilots were studying, they did not know where they would work: at the aircraft plant, or at the Flight Research Institute, or in OKB. Currently, pilots are taken sent to study at the school by their employer which is less effective. Generally any company-employer choose a person having an apartment to live, with local residence permit, who already has everything, but not by the fact that he is the best pilot. Earlier, in Soviet Air Force, there were two or three divisions, each of three regiments, and from each regiment one person was chosen as a candidate for enrolling. The division chose the best one and finally the school received about 12 people. That time the best of the best studied at the state expense. Now the education is paid by the pilot's employer. Training of one person costs from 5 to 20 million rubles.  Training  Currently, FTPS is licensed by the ministry of education as an additional professional education establishment and provides training for test pilots and navigators, flight test engineers and operators involved in flight testing, as well as the air traffic controllers and maintenance engineers. The course curriculum for aircrew training is divided into two major components: theory of flight and flight testing; simulators and flight training. Fixed and rotary wing aircraft are available for training from the fleet of the Gromov Flight Research Institute. International students who have attended the course or subsets of the full course include mostly pilots, from China, France, Laos, the United Kingdom and the United States.

It is the cradle of Yangqi sect of Linji school, on of five schools of Chan Buddhism. History Tang dynasty The temple was built as \\"Guangli Chan Temple\\" () by a renowned Chan master Chengguang () in 753, during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong in the Tang dynasty (618-907). It was enlarged by Chan master Zhenshu () in the Dali era between 766 and 779. Song dynasty During the ruling of Emperor Renzong (1023-1063) in the Song dynasty (960-1279), Yangqi Fanghui (), the Eighth Patriarch of Linji school and the founder of Yangqi sect, was invited to be the new abbot. He renamed the temple \\"Putong Temple\\", which has been used to date. Ming dynasty In 1374, at the dawn of Ming dynasty (1368-1644), monk Siguan () restored the temple. Qing dynasty In 1736, in the 1st year of Qianlong period in the Qing dynasty (1644-1911), monks of Putong Temple raised funds to renovated and refurbished the temple. In 1826, five years after the coronation of Daoguang Emperor, heavy rainfall in the mountain caused a catastrophic flood, Putong Temple was struck by it. In 1844, the reconstruction project of the temple was launched. The reconstruction took 7 years, and lasted from 1844 to 1850. People's Republic of China On July 1, 1957, the Jiangxi Provincial Government inscribed the temple as a provincial level cultural heritage. In 1966, Mao Zedong launched the ten-year Cultural Revolution, the Red Guards attacked the temple and the government forced monks to return to secular life. After the 3rd Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, according to the national policy of free religious belief, Putong Temple was reopened for worship on. In February 2010, Huitong () was proposed as the new abbot of Putong Temple. Two years later, Shi Yongxin, the abbot of Shaolin Monastery, was unanimously chosen as Huitong's successor. In June 2013, the Stupa of Chengguang and the Stupa of Zhenshu were listed among the seventh group of \\"Major National Historical and Cultural Sites in Jiangxi\\" by the State Council of China. Architecture Putong Temple occupies a building area of and the total area including temple lands, forests and mountains is over .

List 19th century *O novo guia da conversação em portuguez e inglez (Pedro Carolino, 1855), Portuguese–English phrasebook written by a man who could not speak English, instead relying on a Portuguese–French phrasebook and a French–English dictionary. The book came to public attention when it was republished in 1883 with the title English as She is Spoke, although that phrase does not appear in the original book. It is notorious for Carolino's literal translation of idioms, which produces unintentionally humorous translations. *The Virginians (William Makepeace Thackeray, 1857–59): historical novel set around the American Revolutionary War, a sequel to Henry Esmond. An apocryphal story claims that Thackeray once confessed to Douglas William Jerrold that The Virginians was \\"the worst novel he ever wrote,\\" while Jerrold replied, \\"No. It's the worst novel anyone ever wrote.\\" In fact, Jerrold died before the first volume of The Virginians was published. J. A. Sutherland agreed to a degree, calling it Thackeray's worst major novel. John Halperin called it \\"the worst book ever produced by a great novelist.\\" Jack P. Rawlins wrote that \\"The Virginians is a bad book – dissatisfying in the reading, acknowledged as dull and dried-up by Thackeray.\\" What Is to Be Done (1863) by Russian socialist author Nikolai Chernyshevsky is considered one of the worst books of the 19th century. *What Is to Be Done? (Nikolai Chernyshevsky, 1863): written in prison in four months by a literary critic and radical, What Is To Be Done? advocates the creation of small socialist cooperatives based on the Russian peasant commune, but oriented toward industrial production. The author promoted the idea that the intellectual's duty was to educate and lead the laboring masses in Russia along a path to socialism that bypassed capitalism. The book inspired many Bolsheviks, including Vladimir Lenin, who wrote a pamphlet with the same title in 1901. However, Mark Schrad observed in Vodka Politics that \\"there is no real plotline or tension, and the environment and characters are stagnant. It has been called the worst novel ever written. Chernyshevsky himself even admitted that his novel contains neither talent nor art, but only 'truth.'\\" Adam Weiner observed on Politico that \\"The czar’s censor had given the novel a pass, reasoning that the dreadful writing style would damage the revolutionary cause.\\" *The Social War (Simon Mohler Landis, 1872): a commercially unsuccessful utopian science fiction novel. Jess Nevins described it in io9 as \\"reprehensible trash, the most objectionable utopia of the 19th century, and the worst science fiction novel of that period\\". *Irene Iddesleigh (Amanda McKittrick Ros, 1897): published by the author's husband as an anniversary present, Irene Iddesleigh is often described as the worst novel ever written, with purple prose that is circumlocutory to the point of incomprehensibility. It was \\"popularised\\" by Barry Pain who called it \\"a thing that happens once in a million years.\\" Mark Twain called it \\"one of the greatest unintentionally humorous novels of all time,\\" while the Inklings competed to see who could read one of Ros's works for the longest without laughter (cf. The Eye of Argon below). In his book Epic Fail, Mark O'Connell wrote \\"Ros’ prose amounts to a sort of accidental surrealism. There is an intention toward metaphor—a lunge in the general direction of the literary—but an obvious misunderstanding of how such things work (and often, for that matter, how syntax works).\\" *The Complete McGonagall (William McGonagall, published between 1877 and 1902): doggerel poetry originally published as broadsheets and then later in collections, usually titled some variation on Poetic Gems. Modern printings collect all of McGonagall's work into a single volume. His lack of knowledge of scansion, deafness to metaphor, inappropriate rhythms, weak vocabulary, and ill-advised imagery combine to make his poetry unintentionally comedic. 20th century Mein Kampf (1925) by a then-unknown Adolf Hitler's diatribe filled with anti-Semitism and that came to influence the Nazi party, was also named one of the worst books of the 20th century. *The Lair of the White Worm (Bram Stoker, 1911): a horror novel revolving around a remote area of England haunted by a gigantic worm. The novel was badly received by historians of the horror genre. H. P. Lovecraft, in his essay Supernatural Horror in Literature, stated that Stoker \\"utterly ruins a magnificent idea by a development almost infantile.\\"H.P. Lovecraft, Supernatural Horror in Literature. Reprinted in Stephen Jones & Dave Carson (eds.) The World's Greatest Horror Stories. New York : Barnes & Noble Books, 2004. (p.45) Les Daniels criticised the \\"clumsy style\\" of the novel and expressed disappointment that the author of the acclaimed Dracula could also write what Daniels regarded as a poor novel.Les Daniels, Living in Fear: a history of horror in the mass media, New York: Scribner, 1975, , p. 63.

London: St. James Press, 1998, , (pp. 574). *Mein Kampf (Adolf Hitler, 1925): Autobiography and political treatise written in Landsberg Prison by Adolf Hitler, then the leader of the National Socialist German Workers' Party. Hitler posits a Jewish conspiracy to gain world leadership, speaks of the evils of communism, Marxism, parliamentary democracy, and of the need of the German people to seize Lebensraum (\\"living space\\") from the Slavic peoples to the east. When Hitler gained control of Germany in the 1930s, the ideology expounded in Mein Kampf would lead to the Second World War, the Holocaust, and tens of millions of deaths. Mein Kampf has been described by many writers as the \\"most evil book in history,\\" and its publication has been illegal or restricted in many countries since the defeat of Nazism in 1945. However, contrary to popular belief, it was never illegal in Germany. Apart from its politics, the book itself has been criticised for its writing style; Hitler's fellow fascist dictator Benito Mussolini called it \\"a boring tome that I have never been able to read\\" and called Hitler's views \\"little more than commonplace clichés.\\" Sally McGrane of The New Yorker wrote \\"Hitler's seven-hundred-page screed [...] is so unreadable that, despite its ubiquity during the Third Reich [...] it is unlikely that most Germans actually cracked the book open. It is full of bombastic, hard-to-follow clauses, historical minutiae, and tangled ideological threads, and both neo-Nazis and serious historians tend to avoid it.\\" *Dildo Cay (Nelson Hayes, 1939): Novel about the white owners of a salt mine worked by slaves on an island off Jamaica. The title refers to dildo cactuses. Pennsylvania State University's Jonathan P. Eburne wrote \\"It is so earnestly bad as to call its own existence into question [...] the product less of an unsteady hand than of a resoundingly tin ear, [with prose] so categorically graceless as to supersede camp and plunge straight into ontological confusion. [...] the novel parades the typically forgettable qualities of other undistinguished midcentury fiction: tawdry displays of local color, liberal deployments of racism and misogyny, textbook Oedipal conflicts, and the hypertrophic use of italics.\\" Despite this poor reception, Dildo Cay was a bestseller, inspiring a film adaptation, Bahama Passage (1941).The Worst Book Ever Is 'Dildo Cay'Publishers Weekly *Across the River and into the Trees (Ernest Hemingway, 1950): Novel about an American ex- soldier who is dying of heart disease, spending a Sunday afternoon hunting ducks in Venice and remembering his experiences of World War I.

(2003). \\"The Stones of Venice, Time and Remembrance: Calculus and Proust in Across the River and into the Trees\\". The Hemingway Review. 22.2. 20–29 Critics claimed the novel was too emotional, had inferior prose and a \\"static plot\\", and that Cantwell was an \\"avatar\\" for Hemingway's character Nick Adams.Meyers, Jeffrey. (1985). Hemingway: A Biography. New York: Macmillan. The novel was also criticized for being an unsuitable autobiography, and for presenting Cantwell as a bitter soldier.Mellow, James. (1992). Hemingway: A Life Without Consequences. New York: Houghton Mifflin. J. Donald Adams in the New York Times called it \\"one of the saddest books I have ever read; not because I am moved to compassion by the conjunction of love and death in the Colonel's life, but because a great talent has come, whether for now or forever, to such a dead end\\". Maxwell Geismar wrote, \\"This is an unfortunate novel and unpleasant to review for anyone who respects Hemingway's talent and achievement. lt is not only Hemingway's worst novel; it is a synthesis of everything that is bad in his previous work and throws an unpleasant light on the future. It is so dreadful, in fact, that it begins to have its own morbid fascination.\\" Philip Rahv wrote that \\"The first thing to be said about this novel is that it is so egregiously bad as to render all comment on it positively embarrassing to anyone who esteems Hemingway as one of the more considerable prose-artists of our time [...] This novel reads like a parody by the author of his own manner—a parody so biting that it virtually destroys the mixed social and literary legend of Hemingway that has now endured for nearly three decades.\\" *Valley of the Dolls (Jacqueline Susann, 1966): Novel about three women who become friends in the post-war Broadway and Hollywood, and become dependent on pills.

Despite the negative reviews, it was successful enough to be eventually adapted for the big screen one year later and a sequel a decade after. *Naked Came the Stranger (various authors, 1969): a collaborative effort by twenty-four journalists under the leadership of Mike McGrady as a criticism of contemporary American writing; McGrady believed that any book could succeed commercially if enough sex was thrown in, and to that end constructed a deliberately incoherent, badly written, sexually explicit novel. It indeed became a bestseller, and sales went up even more once the hoax was revealed. *The Eye of Argon (Jim Theis, 1970): a heroic fantasy novella notorious for purple prose and genre cliché; attempting to read The Eye of Argon out loud without laughing became a popular party game among fantasy readers. = 1990s = *Worlds of Power: Metal Gear (Alexander Frost, 1990): a novelisation of the 1987 video game Metal Gear, it was described as possibly the worst book ever written by Den of Geek's Luke McKinney: \\"This must have been a secret plot by Nintendo of America to destroy any interest in reading which may have lurked within loyal players. And this book is so bad it might cause your brain to forget how to read in self- defense.\\" *Dazzle (Judith Krantz, 1990): a romance novel set in Southern California in the 1980s, in which celebrity photographer Jazz Kilcullen negotiates life and love while contending with her half-sisters who aim to sell off her father's Orange County ranch. John Sutherland described Dazzle as the \\"vulgarest\\" novel he had ever read, and listed it among the 20 worst bestsellers of the 20th century. Michael Dirda of the Washington Post called it \\"unremittingly, heart-sinkingly dull. [...] merely a string of romance narrative cliches tied loosely together by sex scenes every 50 or 60 pages.\\" He later described it as the worst novel he had ever read: \\"Even the sex in the book was boilerplate, a totally meretricious work.\\" Publishers Weekly said \\"Never a disciple of realism, Krantz's interweaving of plots here is too contrived and her relationships, both familial and amatory, too oblique. Her purple prose takes on ever deeper hues, and her customary parade of hyperbolic description is in constant evidence.\\" *Borderliners (Peter Høeg, 1993): a novel about three children who attend a private school in Copenhagen in the 1970s, and then realise that they are part of an experiment. The Irish Times critic Eileen Battersby called it \\"arguably one of the worst books ever written [...] a heavy-handed, monotone polemic [...] the author rehearses every gripe he has ever had about the Danish education system in a novel so unsubtle and woodenly executed as to leave the reader searching for splinters.\\" *The Jam: Our Story (Rick Buckler and Bruce Foxton, 1994): music biography by two members of the mod revival band The Jam. Brian Boyd of The Irish Times called it \\"The worst book ever written\\", noting how obviously the two were bitter at being overshadowed by Paul Weller: \\"the text is littered with disguised snide remarks about their frontman, the two obviously didn't want to ruin their chances of another big payday if a Jam reunion is still on the cards, so they don't go for a full-on assault [...] You finish the book not only realising why Weller hasn't spoken to either of them since their last gig together but also perplexed at how such an obviously clever man managed to tolerate the two of them for so long.\\" *Left Behind: A Novel of the Earth's Last Days (Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins, 1995): post-apocalyptic Evangelical Christian fiction describing the events of the End Times from a premillennial dispensationalist interpretation of the Book of Revelation. Depicts the travails of several survivors who are \\"left behind\\" after the Rapture removes all godly, righteous people from the earth. Despite its commercial success, Left Behind received terrible reviews from mainstream critics. In the London Review of Books, John Sutherland wrote \\"Criticism lacks terms adequate to describe the narrative feebleness of these novels.\\" Fred Clark of Patheos wrote a lengthy analysis of Left Behind and its sequels, calling them \\"The World's Worst Books\\" and discussing the Evangelical subculture from which they derive. In The Escapist, Phil Owen criticised the protagonists for their lack of concern for anyone but other Christians. In The Verge, Adi Robertson observed that \\"With its unpleasant characters, glacial pace, and bizarre preoccupation with phone calls and travel plans, Left Behind may be one of the dullest books [...] to ever hit the bestseller lists.\\" 21st century = 2000s = *The Da Vinci Code (Dan Brown, 2003): A mystery thriller novel following secret societies and the struggle between the Priory of Sion and Opus Dei over the possibility of Mary Magdalene and Jesus having had children together. The Da Vinci Code was widely criticized for its many factual inaccuracies and clumsy prose style. Salman Rushdie called it \\"a novel so bad that it gives bad novels a bad name,\\" while Jodi Picoult said \\"I don't understand the hype over such a poorly written novel – and as an author who does all her own research, I know better than to consider myself an expert in the field I am writing about.\\" Linguistics professor Geoffrey Pullum said \\"Brown's writing is not just bad; it is staggeringly, clumsily, thoughtlessly, almost ingeniously bad.\\" Despite this, the book became a worldwide bestseller and was also successfully adapted into a movie alongside two sequels. *Fan-Tan (Marlon Brando and Donald Cammell, 2005): written in 1979, Fan-Tan was not published until after Brando's death. It was described by Paul Constant of The Stranger as \\"The Best Worst Novel Ever\\", saying that \\"Every line of every page struggles to be as purply out of control as it can be. ... The book simultaneously repulses and attracts, groaning under the weight of its pretension.\\" *Atlanta Nights (various authors, 2005): a collaborative novel created in 2004 by a group of science fiction and fantasy authors, with the express purpose of producing an unpublishably bad piece of work, so as to test whether vanity press PublishAmerica (which insisted it was not a vanity press, but a publisher with stringent standards) would still accept it. They did, only to rescind their offer when the hoax was revealed. *Twilight novel series (Stephenie Meyer, 2005–2008): Although commercially successful and having spawned an also successful movie franchise, the vampire romantic novel series has always been met with mixed to negative critical response, often strongly negative. The Odyssey ranked the series No. 1 in its list of the five worst books of all time, Psychology Today called it \\"Worse than just a bad book\\" due to its dubious moral messages and TheTopTens ranked it No. 1 in its list of the ten worst books of all time. *American Vertigo: Traveling America in the Footsteps of Tocqueville (Bernard-Henri Lévy, 2006): a travelogue by controversial French philosopher Bernard-Henri Lévy, The Economist's \\"Schumpeter\\" column called it \\"perhaps the worst book on America ever written [...] which compounds its uselessness by mentioning Tocqueville, the author of the best book on America ever written, in its subtitle.\\" In a scathing review in The New York Times, Garrison Keillor wrote \\"Bernard-Henri Lévy is a French writer with a spatter-paint prose style and the grandiosity of a college sophomore.\\" = 2010s = *Fifty Shades of Grey (E. L. James, 2011): an erotic novel based on a piece of Twilight fan-fiction, Fifty Shades depicts the BDSM relationship between aloof billionaire Christian Grey and naive student Anastasia Steele. As with The Da Vinci Code, many articles collected lists of the \\"worst lines,\\" particularly those in which Anastasia discusses her \\"inner goddess.\\" As well as being poorly written, many reviewers criticised the relationship between Christian and Anastasia, which was seen as abusive rather than romantic. *Save the Pearls: Revealing Eden (Victoria Foyt, 2012): a dystopian young adult novel, Save the Pearls features a post- apocalyptic setting in which pale-skinned \\"Pearls\\" and dark-skinned \\"Coals\\" are in conflict. The attempt at racial commentary was widely viewed as clumsy and poorly-handled, if not outright racist. In The Guardian, Imogen Russell Williams panned it for \\"awful prose with negligible plot\\", adding \\"the whole thing is remarkable for repetition, incoherence, and prose which makes EL James look like Hector Hugh Munro.\\" *Die Abenteuer des Stefón Rudel (Stefan Knapp, 2012): this self-published sci-fi adventure novel by a widely unknown German amateur author gained a small cult following in Germany due to its poor plotting, awkward word choices, and plentiful spelling and grammar errors. German blogger Christian Schmidt called it the worst book he had ever read. German satirical site Der Postilion called it \\"the maybe worst book of all time\\". Swiss comedians Andreas Storm and Catherine Störmer featured the book in their stage program and called it \\"the worst book ever written in German tongue\\". *Empress Theresa (Norman Boutin, 2014): a self-published science fiction novel, first noted for its unusual cover, a very poorly-drawn image of a female general with large breasts. In the novel, a ten-year-old girl merges with an alien entity, giving her superhuman powers; as she comes of age, she is forced to put these powers to use for the good of mankind. Boutin has achieved notoriety with his hostile responses to critics. YouTuber Fredrik Knudsen's review of the book has received nearly three million views.Empress Theresa  Down the Rabbit Hole by Fredik Knudsen on YouTube *List of the Lost (Morrissey, 2015): a 128-page novel about a 1970s American sprint team written by musician Morrissey (known for being the leader of the 1980s rock group The Smiths). Reviews were uniformly negative, often bordering on hostile. The Daily Mail asked \\"What on earth was [publisher] Penguin thinking?\\" In The Telegraph, Charlotte Runcie described the novel as \\"poorly conceived, awkwardly expressed and lazily imagined.\\" John Niven of the New Statesman, responding to critics who wrote that the book may have been improved by a strong editor, opined that \\"asking a decent editor to save this book would have been like asking a doctor to help a corpse that had fallen from the top of the Empire State Building.\\" *Charles Darwin: Victorian Mythmaker (A. N. Wilson, 2017): a biography of biologist Charles Darwin with an anti-evolution viewpoint. Jerry Coyne, writing in Dawn, called it \\"The worst book about Charles Darwin ever written\\" and \\"a grossly inaccurate and partisan attack on both Darwin and evolution.\\" The Guardian and New Scientist also gave it extremely negative reviews. *Bob Honey Who Just Do Stuff (Sean Penn, 2018): political satire by the two-time Oscar-winning actor about a serial killer. Described by Cracked.com as \\"the worst novel in human history,\\" Mark Hill observed that \\"Penn writes like he's looked up every single word in his thesaurus except \\"dictionary.\\" The novel was also criticised for racist and misogynistic content. In The Guardian, Sian Cain called Bob Honey \\"repellent and stupid on so many levels.\\" The novel does have some high-profile defenders, including acclaimed novelists Salman Rushdie and Paul Theroux. Despite the reviews, a sequel was made one year later as Bob Honey Sings Jimmy Crack Corn. *The Mister (E. L. James, 2019): an erotic romance novel by the author of the Fifty Shades trilogy depicting the relationship between an English aristocrat, Maxim Trevethick, and his Albanian housemaid, Alessia Demachi. It was panned by literary critics. The Guardian described it as \\"A coked-up lord bonks a trafficked Albanian immigrant as the Fifty Shades of Grey author swaps BDSM for dispiritingly creepy power games\\" and adding that \\"There is a complete dearth of emotional maturity that is genuinely unsettling.\\" Jezebel wrote \\"the narrative is so committed to sexualizing Aleissa’s vulnerability and powerlessness that the result is offensive.\\" The Atlantic said it was \\"hopelessly retrograde and dismally unentertaining.\\"In 2019, it was featured on the podcast series 372 Pages We'll Never Get Back.

Lacca Champion, a brindle dog trained by Pat Mullins was voted the Greyhound of the Year after winning the 1978 English Greyhound Derby. Paddy Keane became the first trainer to win both the English Greyhound Derby and Irish Greyhound Derby following the 1978 Irish Greyhound Derby win by Pampered Rover. Tracks Ramsgate owners Northern Sports bought Oxford in April, with the proviso from the council that the Stadium must be used as a recreational Stadium until 1983. The Managing Director David Hawkins changed the stadium name back to Oxford Stadium from Cowley Stadium; Bob Newson was appointed the General Manager and Jim Layton would soon arrive as Racing Manager from Catford. Northern Sports also owned Doncaster and then added independent track Long Eaton to their portfolio bringing four tracks under their banner. Brandon Stadium in Coventry opened on 19 September. Independent track Cambridge had a second attempt at NGRC racing on 24 November; the previous attempt had only lasted five months. This second spell would be more successful with top trainers Joe Cobbold, Natalie Savva and Pat Mullins taking attachments at the track over the next couple of years. Watford closed on 30 October; the site would now only be used by the football club. As a consequence the BAGS contract went to Willenhall. News The Greyhound Racing Association (GRA) made a profit which helped pay back some of their debt. The sale of the land that formerly housed Harringay Arena boosted the profits. Trainer Phil Rees Sr. retired from training and his licence was handed to his son Phil Rees Jr. The latter chose not to take part in the trainer's championship because he had qualified by virtue of his fathers achievements in 1977. Gordon Hodson returned from Australia to take up a contract trainer's position at Brighton and two respected trainers Sid Ryall and Dave Barker retired. After a decade at Brighton, Peter Shotton took the role of head of racing at Wembley followed to the track by his assistant Jim Cremin. Other Racing Managers on the move were Jim Simpson to Romford from Crayford, Des Nichols moved to Brighton from Romford just one year after taking over from Les Cox. Paul Richardson took the chair at Brough Park and Gosforth replacing Tony Smith who switched to Crayford. At Hall Green Assistant Racing Manager Horace Peplow retired after 50 years on the racing staff and was replaced by Simon Harris son of former trainer the late Roger Harris. John McCririck was brought in as an investigative reporter for the Sporting Life. In 1978, McCririck was voted the Specialist Writer of the Year in the British Press Awards. His stories included a sting that he had exposed based on the fact that Extel, who used to broadcast commentaries into betting shops, gave the off-times for greyhound races in minutes, without the refinement of seconds. By briefly delaying the commentaries, criminals were able to back dogs after a race had started. During the same year McCririck took the lead in covering the Rochester Stadium coup. The track had decided to hold a dual distance event with heats over 277 metres and a final over 901 metres, unusual competitions were seen as an interesting way of presenting racing by several management teams. Two greyhounds trained by Jack Purvis both won sprint heats, Leysdown Pleasure at 33-1 and Leysdown Fun at 4-1. They had been backed off course by five South London men winning a reputed £350,000. Fun was withdrawn from the 901 metre final and Pleasure finished last, not staying the distance. BOLA advised its members to withhold payment and the Big Four Bookmakers refused to pay out. The NGRC held an inquiry and found no evidence of rule breaking. The police submitted a report to the DPP (Director of Public Prosecutions) who also took no action. It appeared that a legitimate coup had been staged and a protest resulted where 800 betting shop offices had their locks super-glued for not paying out. It was not until 1985 that a judge agreed that bookmakers were not liable to pay out. Competitions Greenfield Fox trained by Ted Dickson continued his fine form carried over from 1977 by claiming the Scurry Gold Cup in April from favourite Lacca Champion. Another Pat Mullins greyhound Paradise Spectre (the Grand Prix champion) won the Guys and Dolls trophy and won 18 consecutive races from 9 September 1977 to 4 February 1978. Dickson had a superb year winning the Trainers Championship at Monmore, where he gained five winners, Donals Greatest, Rip Perry, Kudas Toy, Lesleys Charm and Black Legend.

It is now in the Galleria nazionale di Parma. It is signed at the bottom right-hand corner. It shows the artist returning to a theme he had first painted five years earlier, in a work now in Dresden. In the 17th century it is recorded as being in the Palazzo Farnese in Rome, as shown by a seal on its reverse. It was most probably commissioned directly from the artist by cardinal Alessandro Farnese - the painter had come from Rome to Venice in 1570 and was recommended to Farnese by Giulio Clovio, then in the service of the Farnese family. He had found an admirer in the cardinal's librarian Fulvio Orsini. Another reason for thinking it was a direct commission are portraits of members of the Farnese family in the background, which are not present in other two paintings by El Greco of the same subject - one is in the Gemäldegalerie in Dresden (produced during his first stay in Venice) and the other in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York (from the time of his arrival in Spain). One of the figures in the group on the left seems to be Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma and in the middle of the line cardinal Ranuccio Farnese, the latter being a post-mortem portrait.

White City remains the top earner with an average meeting tote turnover of £55,677, some £5,000 more than closest rival Walthamstow Stadium. Desert Pilot, a white and brindle dog and Kilmagoura Mist, a brindle bitch, were voted joint Greyhound of the Year. Desert Pilot won the Select Stakes and Wembley Summer Cup, Kilmagoura Mist won the St Leger. Sarahs Bunny, a kennelmate of Desert Pilot won the 1979 English Greyhound Derby. Tracks Three tracks closed, Rochester (4 October), Halifax and the Horton Road Stadium in Gloucester (6 July). News The BGRF (British Greyhound Racing Federation) went into voluntary liquidation, the organisation body that had only been formed in 1977 between the NGRC and track promoters had been a disaster. Bizarrely despite the financial losses of the body a new replacement called the British Greyhound Racing Board was set up within months, with the aim to promote and elevate the greyhound racing industry, to improve the welfare and rules of racing. Leeds closed their track kennels and lost three top trainers in the process, Joe Kelly, Tommy Brown and Jim Brennan (better known for his spell at Sheffield). Kelly was recruited by Racing Manager Terry Meynell and moved into the kennels of the late Harry Bamford, who had died aged just 40 while Brown and Brennan retired. Contracted trainers replacing them at Leeds were Pete Beaumont, Jim Brown and Ray Andrews. New Southend trainer Tom Lanceman also supplied runners for Ipswich, he was one of the first ever trainers to take up a dual attachment. Lanceman also trained the Grand National winner Topofthetide to a second successive win, the greyhound had won in 1978 for Tim Forster at odds on. Lacca Champion was retired after the Derby and Joe De Mulder, former trainer and father of Geoff De Mulder died. Competitions A newcomer called Sports Promoter reared by Pat and Linda Mullins broke the track record over 400 metres at Cambridge in his first race and went on to win the Romford Puppy Cup and Sporting Life Juvenile. The Olympic returned after an eight year absence, the event was resurrected by Brighton. John Honeysett won a closely fought Trainers Championship at Crayford after defeating John Coleman by just two points. Both had three winners on the night, Honeysett (Sandpiper Folly, Langford Dan, Triple Aspect), Coleman (Noble Brigg, Head Prefect, Our Rufus). Ireland The Bord na gCon announced a massive 60% hike in prize money. The grand re-opening of Galway was on 25 May, with the modernisation costing over £500,000.

The increase in tote turnover indicated a significant increase in spend per head because attendances had decreased significantly. The decrease could partly be blamed on 200 less meetings but the fact that tracks charged a 17% tote retention would have been another factor. Regardless of blame it was the lowest attendance return on record, even less than the first full year of racing in 1927. Sport Promoter, a brindle dog was voted Greyhound of the Year. He won Gold Collar at Catford Stadium and the Grand Prix at Walthamstow Stadium. Tracks Nottingham Greyhound Stadium opened on 24 January. Ladbrokes closed Willenhall for development and cut prize money at Perry Barr and Monmore. Eastville Stadium suffered a major fire, and the majority of the south stand was destroyed causing more than £1 million worth of damage. Later in the year some consolation arrived in the form of a Bookmakers Afternoon Greyhound Service (BAGS) debut in November, and along with Hackney would become the backbone of the betting shop service. Monmore also joined the BAGS, which is currently supplied by White City Manchester, Hackney, Wembley and Harringay. Bletchley in Milton Keynes under the new promotion of Reg Young rejoined the NGRC under the permit scheme and would become known as Milton Keynes Stadium instead of Bletchley. Maidstone and Long Eaton would leave the scheme and the Knott family sold their interest in Poole Stadium. News An outbreak of Parvovirus killed hundreds of pups in the early part of the year. The Greyhound Racing Association (GRA) continue to recover from their debt and repay creditors. Arthur Hancock retired as a trainer at Brighton and was replaced by GRA trainer Derek Knight who had previously been at Shawfield. Ireland The Bord na gCon increase prize money by a further 25%. Knockrour Slave won the Irish Laurels for the second successive year and break the Cork Greyhound Stadium track record in the final recording 29.00 sec. Competitions 1979 Greyhound of the Year Desert Pilot reached the St Leger final at Wembley Greyhounds and performed well but lost out to Fair Reward trained by Bob Young with Decoy Sovereign runner up. Decoy Sovereign was trained by the Cobbold family Joe Cobbold and wife Doreen and had been bred by Brenda Baggs, wife of Gary Baggs who were helping the Cobbolds at the time. Decoy Sovereign easily won the Scottish Greyhound Derby final, the fawn dog defeated a good field. A greyhound called Rahan Ship has been ante post favourite for the Glasgow classic but had been withdrawn following the wrong form being printed in the racecard. The NGRC instigated an inquiry and some track officials lost their jobs before the dog returned to Ireland.

B. Johnson or Napoleon B. Johnson) was born on January 17, 1891, in Maysville, Oklahoma (then in Cherokee Nation, Indian Territory). He was the oldest child of John Wade and Sarah (née Mays) Johnson, who had three other children, as well. John Johnson was half Cherokee, and his wife was white, making Napoleon and his siblings one-quarter Cherokee. The father was a professional stock trader and an elder in a local Presbyterian church. John raised his son like any other native Cherokee boy and saw to it that he started his education in a local Presbyterian mission school.Herley, Samuel H. \\"The Coming Tide\\": Viewpoints on the Formation of U.S. Federal Indian Termination Policy, 1945-1954. April, 2010. Dissertation Presented to the Faculty of The Graduate College at the University of Nebraska In Partial Fulfillment of Requirements For the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy. He moved to Claremore in 1905, which he called his home most of his life. Harlow, Victor Emmanuel. \\"Rogers County.\\" Makers of Government in Oklahoma. p. 720. Harlow Publishing Co. 1930. Accessed June 22, 2018. His formal education ended with a Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.) degree at Cumberland University. In 1908, Napoleon apparently felt the urge to venture more widely. After visiting a naval recruiting station in Oklahoma City, he won parental approval to enlist. According to Herley, he became quite homesick while even before he arrived at a naval base in California. Still, he persisted, and spent a month training aboard the U.S.S. Pensacola, before returning home. It was the end of his naval career. Johnson graduated from Mary Gregory Memorial School, a Presbyterian mission school, at Anadarko in western Oklahoma in 1909. After graduation from high school, Johnson joined the federal Indian Service, working first at a variety jobs in Tower, Minnesota, the Otoe-Missouria agency at Red Rock, Oklahoma (1913-14), and the Chilocco Indian Agricultural School at Chilocco, Oklahoma (1914-17). He later graduated from the state University Preparatory School (later renamed Oklahoma Military Academy), and attended Henry Kendall College (now Tulsa University). Johnson re-entered the military during 1918, this time enlisting in the U.S. Army. After his discharge, he worked briefly for the Osage Indian Agency legal department, then returned to Claremore where he was appointed Assistant District Attorney for Rogers County, Oklahoma. The biographical sketch written by Harlow in 1930 noted Johnson's interest in tribal and educational affairs. Early years Johnson was educated in the Anadarko schools, Mary Gregory Presbyterian Mission, Eastern University Prep School, Henry Kendall College (later renamed as the University of Tulsa), where he spent two years. Then he went to Cumberland University, where he earned the LL.B. degree in June, 1921. He returned to Oklahoma, where he passed the bar exam and became a licensed attorney, then went to work in the legal department of the Osage Agency, before moving back to Claremore. Johnson worked for the U.S. Indian Service in 1913–17, then became assistant county attorney for Rogers County, Oklahoma in 1923–25, then county attorney 1925–28. Herley wrote that Johnson was elected to another term as county attorney in 1930, which he resigned in 1931 to open his own law practice; he continued for three years, when he was appointed as district judge for the Oklahoma Twelfth District. Harlow's biographical sketch noted that Johnson attended tribal meetings at Talequah and \\"...takes unusual interest in tribal affairs and educational work for Indians.\\" Harlow also wrote that in 1920, Johnson was listed as a registered Democrat and County Attorney for Rogers County, Oklahoma. p.717. Herley noted that about 1925, Johnson began participating in Democratic conventions in Oklahoma City. Indian activism Consistent with his political party affiliation, Johnson actively supported Franklin D. Roosevelt and his New Deal Program in the early 1930s. He was soon disappointed, and particularly disagreed with the new Democratic Commissioner of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), John Collier. Although Johnson was a member of the Cherokee tribe, his views about the organization needed to cope with the massive Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) extended much farther than a single tribe. The National Congress of American Indians (NCAI) held its first convention in Denver, Colorado, in 1944. Initially, Johnson was reluctant to attend, but was talked into going by some of his many friends in Oklahoma. His level of education, knowledge of the American legal system and how to work within it, status as a judge and his natural skills as a leader impressed attendees who had not previously known him. He was unanimously elected president of the NCAI. About 80 delegates from 50 tribes and associations in 27 states came together at the Cosmopolitan Hotel in Denver, Colorado, on November 15, 1944. The delegates then created ten permanent committees and elected an executive council, consisting of four officers and eight councilmen. By November 18, the council had passed 18 resolutions that concerned three main topics: (1) sovereignty, (2) civil rights and (3) political recognition for all Indians. These became the platform NCAI would address during the coming year. Within a year, NCAI claimed to have over 300 members, from nearly every tribe in the U.S. Johnson served as president until 1952. \\"The Founding Meeting of NCAI.\\" National Congress of American Indians. Accessed June 24, 2018. By 1952, Johnson was hearing warnings that many members felt that his approach was ineffective in combating the political leaders who continued to press for termination of Federal benefits to Indians. Some members even claimed that NCAI was controlled by \\"...a small clique of its present officers,\\" and \\"stooges of the Indian Bureau.\\" An astute politician, Johnson announced that he was resigning as President of NCAI, and would be replaced by W. W. Short. Oklahoma Supreme Court Scandal Judge Corn's Confession On December 9, 1964, former Oklahoma Supreme Court Justice, N. S. Corn, then 80 years old and serving an 18-month sentence in a federal prison for income tax evasion, gave a sworn statement to the government detailing his involvement in the crime of bribery. The document named two other Supreme Court justices, Napoleon B. Johnson and Earl Welch, plus several other people as also participating in the scheme. Corn also admitted that he could not recall failing to receive a bribe in any of the 24 years he had served on the court. Ten days later, Corn was freed early. O'Hern, Linda Burkett. \\"Supreme Court Scandal Examined.\\" NewsOK. February 23, 1967. Accessed June 22, 2018.\\"Schaefer, Ralph. \\"Judiciary’s dark days recalled.\\" Wagoner County American-Tribune. December 12, 2012. Accessed June 22, 2018 One copy of Corn's affidavit was sent to Federal Judge Stephen Chandler. Simply having Corn's affidavit in hand was not enough to start a battle for reform. Chandler then called one of the most recently elected Supreme Court judges, William H. Berry, for a private meeting at Chandler's home, where Berry read the document and agreed that somehow the document must be made public. With Chandler's agreement, Berry contacted Oklahoma County Representative, G. T. Blankenship, who was appalled by what the document revealed. Berry assured Blankenship that if he would read Corn's affidavit aloud from the House floor, he (Blankenship) would be protected by legislative immunity and could not be sued. The representative agreed to do this. After the legislature reconvened in January, 1965, Blankenship asked for the floor and began to speak. Apparently, the subject was still a well kept secret. The House remained in absolute silence throughout the speech. The stunned Democratic members began to shout cries of \\"Politics!\\" But the press reported the entire story to the public and would not let go. The Oklahoman printed a stirring editorial about how the state needed to reform the way judges were elected. So many powerful politicians believed that they had greatly benefitted from the status quo, that many people expected serious retribution against Blankenship. Governor Henry Bellmon ordered the State Board of Investigation to sweep the legislator's house for electronic eavesdropping devices, thinking that the opposition would likely try to destroy his credibility. He was also warned to go straight home every night after work - no stops for drinks or dinner at bars and restaurants for the same reason. Investigation and Impeachment On March 9, 1965, Supreme Court Justice Johnson took a lie detector examination concerning the allegation that he received $7,500 in return for a favorable ruling. He failed. Following that, the Oklahoma State House of Representatives passed bills of impeachment against him. The Oklahoma State Senate convicted him, automatically removing him from office and ending his judicial career.\\"This month in OK History.\\" March 9, 2017 Accessed June 22, 2018. After Johnson's conviction, Justice Berry wrote a book, Justice for Sale: The Shocking Scandal of the Oklahoma Supreme Court, detailing his views of the scandal. In it, he placed much of the blame on the system Oklahoma used for selecting judges, especially those trying to become appellate judges. Berry called the old system, in which bribes were simply passed off as \\"campaign contributions,\\" \\"...a scandal waiting to happen.\\" Burck Bailey, president of the Oklahoma Bar Association, said in a 1988 address to the OBA:\\"The villain in this sordid affair may be the method used in Oklahoma to fill judicial office.... The potential for corruption is inherent in the system. These payoffs, (as claimed by Cargill and Corn) were simply ‘campaign contributions’.\\"[http:// www.okbar.org/members/Members/PresidentsMessage/January2016.aspx Isaacs, Garvin A. \\"Will We Let History Repeat Itself?\\" Oklahoma Bar Journal.

Attendances had decreased significantly for the second year running, although party due to 200 less meetings it was a worrying time for the industry. Track tote retention remained 17% and government tote tax 4%. Decoy Boom, a fawn bitch was voted Greyhound of the Year. She won the BBC TV Trophy, GRA Stakes, Scottish Marathon, Stow Marathon and Longcross Cup. Tracks Chesterton Greyhound Stadium and Maidstone joined the NGRC permit scheme. Two independents opened Brownhills and Skegness. News Tim Hale and Derek Bowman replaced Racing Manager Harry Bridger at Leeds; the track owners Ladbrokes later announced the site would be used for industrial development in the near future. Towards the end of the year the country suffered terrible weather and the majority of the horse racing fixtures were cancelled. This meant that extra afternoon race meetings were organised to help the betting shops. Extra fixtures were organised by Hackney, Bristol, Monmore, Cambridge, Romford and Crayford. This provided an opportunity for tracks to negotiate a better deal for the future to combat the drop in attendances blamed on the betting shops, however they failed to do so preferring to take short term cash benefits instead. The Greyhound Racing Association (GRA) announced that they had repaid two thirds of their debt. The business was doing well from its greyhound racing income which begged the question as to how the company allowed themselves to get into such debt in the first place. Leading trainer Pat Mullins died in March after collapsing whilst working at his kennels in Manningtree. He had suffered a heart attack the previous year and had been warned by doctors to avoid stress. His wife Linda Mullins would take over the kennels. The leading independent trainer Charlie Lister took out an NGRC licence and would soon gain some success, his first breakthrough was with Swift Band, who won the 1981 East Anglian Derby. Competitions Marbella Sky won the Scottish Greyhound Derby at Shawfield Stadium, and later finished runner up in the Edinburgh Cup at Powderhall Stadium. The greyhound (still a puppy) faced an exciting future but was then stolen from the Wakefield kennels of his trainer Ray Andrews. He was never recovered. A new major event was inaugurated at Wembley called the Blue Riband and would replace the long running Wembley Spring Cup which had been one of the first major competitions in the greyhound racing calendar. The Grand National at White City went to Bobcol trained by Norah McEllistrim; the black dog had already won the Springbok crown the previous year. The hurdler went on to score a hat-trick when travelling to Powderhall and winning the Scottish Grand National. Lauries Panther, a black and white dog, whelped in April, 1980 by Shamrock Sailor out of Lady Lucy, was owned by Laurie James and trained at Romford by Terry Duggan and appeared on the racing scene in the Bobby Jack Puppy Cup run at Wimbledon Stadium in November, followed by the Christmas Puppy Cup at Romford. He performed well and would be aimed at the Pall Mall Stakes the following year.

He showed very good form as a two-year-old in 1897 when he won three of his five races and finished third in the Middle Park Plate. In the following year he ran fourth in the 2000 Guineas and was fancied for the Epsom Derby before being scratched from the race. He returned in September to win the St Leger, upsetting the Derby winner Jeddah but did not race again. He stood as a breeding stallion in Ireland and France but was not a great success although he did sire a top-class performer in Llangibby and an influential broodmare in Silver Fowl. Background Wildfowler was a \\"cobby\\" chestnut horse with four white socks bred at the Barronstown House stud in Ireland (then part of the United Kingdom) by Henry Greer, who owned the colt during his racing career. Greer sent the colt to be trained by Sam Darling at Beckhampton who took a share in the ownership. Wildfowler's sire Gallinule was an exceptionally fast and precocious horse who won the National Breeders' Produce Stakes as a juvenile in 1886. He later became a very successful breeding stallion whose other offspring included Pretty Polly and Night Hawk. Wildfowler's dam Tragedy won the Irish Derby in 1889 and went on to be an influential broodmare whose other descendants have included Birds Nest, Chelsea Rose, La Lagune, Lagunette and Sicambre. Racing career 1897: two-year-old season On his racecourse debut Wildfowler contested the Plantation Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse in July and looked to be lacking in both fitness and experience as he finished third behind Lucknow and Stream of Gold. Wildfowler won the Rous Plate at Doncaster Racecourse on 9 September, beating the filly St Ia in \\"decisive\\" fashion. In the Autumn Breeders' Foal Plate at Manchester two weeks later he won again, beating the subsequent 1000 Guineas winner Nun Nicer into second place. At the first October meeting at Newmarket, Wildfowler claimed his third consecutive victory by taking the Rutland Stakes. In the Middle Park Plate over six furlongs at Newmarket on 15 October, Wildfowler started the 7/2 second favourite. Ridden by John Watts he finished third behind Dieudonne and Disraeli, beaten three lengths and a head. 1898: three-year-old season On his first appearance of 1898 Wildfowler was beaten at odds of 1/10 by his solitary opponent in the Drakelow Stakes at Derby Racecourse. In the 2000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket on 27 April Wildfowler was ridden by Fred Allsopp and started at odds of 10/1 in a thirteen-runner field. He tracked the leaders before taking the lead in the last quarter mile but was overtaken in the closing stages and finished fourth behind Disraeli, Wantage and Ninus. Wildfowler was among the leading fancies for the Epsom Derby on 25 May but was withdrawn a week before the race. The 123rd edition of the St Leger was contested over fourteen and a half furlongs at Doncaster on 7 September and saw Wildfowler, with Charles Wood in the saddle, start the 10/1 second choice in the betting. The Derby winner Jeddah was made the 5/6 favourite while the other ten runners included Disraeli, Pheon and Ninus. Heckler set the pace from Ninus before Jeddah took the lead entering the straight. Wildfowler came from well off the pace, overtook the favourite just inside the final furlong and drew away to win by four lengths from Jeddah, with six lengths back to the 25/1 outsider Bridegroom in third. Wildfowler was put up for auction at Newmarket on 26 October and was bought by Henry Greer for 5,500 guineas in a transaction which saw Greer buy out Sam Darling's share in the horse. Stud record At the end of his racing career, Wildfowler was retired to become breeding stallion at Greer's stud. In 1908 he was sold for 5,000 guineas and exported to France. Wildfowler died in 1917 at the Bel-Ebat Stud in La Celle-Saint-Cloud, France. The best of his offspring was Llangibby, who was placed in the 2000 Guineas in 1905 before winning the Eclipse Stakes as a four-year-old in 1906. His daughter Silver Fowl produced Fifinella and was the female-line ancestor of many other major winners.

He currently competes part-time in the ARCA Menards Series West, driving the No. 42 Chevrolet for Jefferson Racing, and part-time in the ARCA Menards Series, driving the No. 17W Chevrolet for Steve McGowan Motorsports. Racing career 2016: West Series debut After racing in the Pirelli World Challenge, Rodgers began racing in the NASCAR K&N; Pro Series West in 2016, driving for team owner Dave Hanson. He made his debut at Sonoma Raceway, finishing in 17th. He ended the season with four top-ten finishes. 2017: Breakthrough with Kevin Harvick Sonoma in 2017 Rodgers returned to the series in 2017, running full-time in the K&N; Pro Series West for Jefferson Pitts Racing. He opened the season with four consecutive top- five finishes. At Sonoma, Rodgers qualified on pole position, earning his first career pole in the series. While he led early, Rodgers was eventually passed by 2014 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series champion Kevin Harvick, finishing second. Rodgers said after the race, \\"For some funny reason, I had a feeling as far back as four weeks ago that it was going to be me and Kevin coming into turn 11 on the last lap. And sure enough, there we were. He ran a really good race, I learned a lot from him. We were able to lead some laps there in the beginning. It doesn't feel too bad to finish second today.\\" Harvick, meanwhile, was impressed with Rodgers' performance, stating, \\"That was really what this was all about, to shine a little light on a kid like Will and race against him and give him the recognition he deserves. I want to keep supporting the series and bring that bright light on some of these kids who need the opportunity.\\" The race became a turning point for Rodgers' career; in May 2018, Autoweek writer Matt Weaver argued that Rodgers had \\"gained more from his graceful defeat than if he had won the race without the participation of a Cup Series veteran.\\" Rodgers spoke of the race as having done \\"wonders for my career. We got a lot of attention....I can't say enough about how helpful Kevin was. He put me on his radio show and told the world that he respected me. That was huge.\\" Rodgers ran the rest of the season for Pitts' team, adding another second-place finish at Evergreen Speedway. Rodgers also ran the two road course races in the 2017 NASCAR K&N; Pro Series East season. Rodgers earned his first career K&N; Series win at Watkins Glen International, holding off Rubén García Jr. after García hit the wall attempting to overtake him. After the race, Harvick, despite not participating in the event, visited Rodgers in Victory Lane to congratulate him on the win. Rodgers also won the second road course race of the season at New Jersey Motorsports Park. 2018: Road course dominance, ARCA debut Rodgers celebrates his West Series win at Sonoma in 2018 In 2018, Rodgers returned to Jefferson Pitts Racing for the K&N; West season opener at Kern County Raceway Park. After finishing a disappointing 16th, Rodgers moved to Bob Farmer's team for the doubleheader at Tucson Speedway. He finished ninth and seventh in the first and second race respectively. On June 16, Rodgers returned to the East Series to run again at New Jersey Motorsports Park. He won the race after qualifying second and leading 49 of the 55 laps, earning his third road course victory in four such races at the K&N; level and establishing himself as one of the series' road course ringers. Two days before the race, Harvick reaffirmed his support for Rodgers and argued, \\"When the road course stuff shows up, Will is probably capable of being in an Xfinity race or a Cup race. In the right equipment on a road course, he'd be a top-10 competitor.\\" The next week, Rodgers returned to Sonoma for the K&N; West race; while Harvick did not enter the 2018 race, a total of five Cup Series drivers (Aric Almirola, William Byron, Daniel Suárez, Erik Jones, and Alex Bowman) did participate. Rodgers beat all of them, qualifying on the pole and winning his fourth consecutive road course race at the K&N; level. Rodgers later joined Levin Racing for the race at Gateway Motorsports Park. Before the 2018 ARCA Racing Series season-opener at Daytona International Speedway, Rodgers was also announced as a driver for Ken Schrader Racing for select races, including Daytona. The race was Rodgers' first on an oval track longer than one mile in length. At Daytona, Rodgers was involved in an accident in turn 4 on lap 21, which led to him finishing 25 laps down in 30th place. Rodgers then rebounded to finish eighth in his next race at Charlotte Motor Speedway. Later in the season, he set a new career- best finish with a sixth-place run at Michigan International Speedway. 2019: K&N; return at Sonoma and Xfinity debut Rodgers at an at-track event during the Sonoma race weekend in 2019 Rodgers began the 2019 season on the sidelines (working on the business aspect of his career by recruiting sponsors) but returned to Levin Racing for the K&N; Pro Series West race at Sonoma. He spent the week leading up to the event serving as a driver coach to fellow K&N; Pro Series driver Hailie Deegan. In July, Rodgers joined Brandonbilt Motorsports for his NASCAR Xfinity Series debut in the U.S. Cellular 250 at Iowa Speedway.

Early life Kernochan was born on December 8, 1842 in New York City in a house at 8th Street and Second Avenue. He was the son of Joseph Kernochan (1789–1864) and Margaret Eliza (née Seymour) Kernochan (1804–1845). His siblings included William Seymour Kernochan, James Powell Kernochan, Elizabeth Powell Kernochan Garr, John Adams Kernochan, Henry Parish Kernochan, Ann Adams Kernochan, and Frank Edward Kernochan. His father, who was born in Scotland and came to America in 1790 as a baby, was a dry goods merchant and banker that was a founder of the University Club of New York. His paternal grandparents were William and Esther Kernochan, Scotch-Irish Presbyterians who had a farm in Orange County, and his maternal grandparents were William Seymour and Eliza (née Powell) Seymour, an English family who lived in Brooklyn. He prepared for college at the Aaron N. Skinner's (former Presidents pro tempore of the Connecticut Senate) school in New Haven, Connecticut before enrolling, and later graduating, from Yale University with a Bachelor of Arts in 1863. At Yale, he was a member of Alpha Sigma Phi, Delta Kappa Epsilon, Skull and Bones, and Phi Beta Kappa. He then attended and graduated from Columbia Law School with a Bachelor of Laws in 1865, where he was valedictorian of his class. Career In May 1865, he was admitted to the bar of the Supreme Court of New York County. After a year spent traveling abroad, he joined the law office of Abraham R. Lawrence in New York City working there from 1867 until 1869. In 1869, he formed a partnership with his brother Frank under firm name of F. E. & J. F. Kernochan in New York, operating until 1873 when decided to stop practicing law. After that point, he practiced independently focusing on testamentary law, dealing with trusts and estates. From 1898 until 1918, he was president of Arminius Chemical Company, which owned valuable mines in Virginia. He was also a member of the board of directors of Astoria Steel Company. From 1909 to 1929, he served as a director of Lawyers' Title Company and of the Stephen Whitney Estate Company. Society life In 1892, Kernochan and his wife Mary were included in Ward McAllister's \\"Four Hundred\\", purported to be an index of New York's best families, published in The New York Times. Conveniently, 400 was the number of people that could fit into Mrs. Astor's ballroom. From 1893 to 1901, Kernochan was the president of New York Free Circulating Library (which was later absorbed by the New York Public Library) and was a charter member of New York City Bar Association in 1869. He was a warden of All Saint's Memorial Church in Navesink, New Jersey a member of vestry of Grace Church in New York City. Personal life On April 15, 1869, Kernochan was married to Mary Stuart Whitney (1849–1922), the daughter of William and Mary Stuart (née McVickar) Whitney. Her paternal grandparents were merchant Stephen Whitney and Harriet (née Suydam) Whitney. For many years, they lived at 11 East 26th Street, on the north side of Madison Square, until Kernochan and his wife hired the prominent architectural firm of Cross & Cross to build a large five story mansion at 862 Park Avenue (and 77th Street) in 1914. Together, they were the parents of five children: * Eweretta Kernochan (1870–1954), who did not marry. * William Kernochan (b. 1873), who died in infancy. * Frederic Kernochan (1876–1937), a Chief Justice of the Court of Special Sessions who married Elizabeth Howland (1885–1973). * Mary Stuart Whitney Kernochan (b. 1880), who married Courtland Smith (1884-1970), son of Orlando J. Smith, in 1929. * Whitney Kernochan (1884–1969), who married Helen (née Gaynor) Bradford (1894–1951), daughter of New York City Mayor William Jay Gaynor, in 1921. She was divorced from Edward Thomas Bedford, a son of oilman E.T. Bedford. His wife died at their country home in Bernardsville, New Jersey on August 11, 1922. He later resided at 907 Fifth Avenue. Kernochan died in New York City on August 17, 1929, and after a funeral service at Grace Church, he was buried at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, which was founded by his wife's grandfather. His estate was split between his four living children.

It sometimes lives symbiotically with a copepod or a comb jelly, and is prone to shed its arms, which then regenerate into new individuals. Description Echinaster luzonicus is normally a six-armed starfish but is often rather asymmetrical in appearance because of its habit of shedding arms. It is somewhat variable in colouring, ranging from red to dark brown. Both these colour morphs were collected off Heron Island in the Great Barrier Reef, and individuals seemed able to change their colour from red to brown and back again, possibly as a response to the amount of ambient light they received. Distribution and habitat Echinaster luzonicus is found in the tropical and sub-tropical western Indo-Pacific region. Its range extending from Madagascar and the east coast of Africa to Northern Australia, Indonesia and the Philippines. A common species, it is found on both reef crests and in the intertidal zone. Ecology Echinaster luzonicus feeds on bacterial and algal films that it extracts from the sediment. This species is unique in its genus in that it reproduces asexually by autotomizing its arms; the shed arm then regenerates, growing a new disc and further arms. This species has not been recorded breeding in any other way. A species of copepod, lives symbiotically on the oral (under) surface of Echinaster luzonicus; it is so cryptically coloured as to be almost indistinguishable from its host. Another associate of this starfish is the comb jelly, Coeloplana astericola, which grows in abundance on its aboral (upper) surface. Research A novel cyclic steroid glycoside has been isolated from the tissues of Echinaster luzonicus and has been named luzonicoside A. Four further cyclic glycosides containing carbohydrate fragments have since been named luzonicosides B to E; luzonicoside F, another glycoside, is an open carbohydrate chain steroid. These metabolites exhibit varying degrees of lysosomal activity.

Raised in 1889, it served in California during the Mexican border war from 1916 to 1917 and in France during World War I. In 1921 it was redesignated Headquarters Troop of the 24th Cavalry Division. On the eve of World War II, it was converted into Headquarters Company of the 103rd Anti-Tank Battalion. History Formation and early history Troop B dismounted, circa 1905 Upon return from deployment to the Mexican border, Troop B was given the liberty of the chamber of the Washington House of Representatives (pictured here in 2009). The front page of The Tacoma Times on April 30, 1917 Elements of Troop B of the 58th Machine Gun Squadron, pictured in Wyoming in 1923 The Tacoma City Troop of the Washington Territorial Militia was activated in 1889 and redesignated Troop B of the Washington Cavalry, an unnumbered cavalry regiment sometimes referred to as 1st Washington Cavalry, upon the accession of Washington to the United States that year. It served as the mounted escort to Governor of Washington Elisha P. Ferry during his inauguration in 1892. Following the 1902 death of Governor John Rankin Rogers, eight soldiers of Troop B were assigned to provide the guard of honor for the lying in state of Rogers' remains. In 1904, the troop participated in maneuvers at American Lake involving, in addition to other units of the Washington National Guard, elements of the Oregon National Guard and the United States Army. Deployments =Mexican border emergency= As of March 1916 the troop had an authorized strength of 103, and an actual strength of 55. During the Mexican border emergency of 1916, Troop B was among the Washington units called up and \\"performed the considerable feat of recruiting up to wartime strength and assembling at their mobilization camp in six days\\". The troop departed for Calexico, California by rail on June 30 and, by July 7, had set-up camp. In late July, Sergeant W.R. Tyree commented on conditions in Calexico in a letter to his wife: The following November, Governor Ernest Lister departed for California to visit the men in camp. Troop B remained on duty in California until early 1917 and was mustered out of federal service in Vancouver, Washington, in February of that year. Prior to dismissal, it was invited to the Washington House of Representatives and, by a resolution of that body, extended the liberty of the chamber, making it the only state legislature to give a National Guard unit the privileges of the house for service during the border emergency. During the Troop B deployment, discharged veterans of the unit organized a rump replacement to maintain \\"a semblance of a mounted organization in Tacoma\\" during that year's Preparedness Day parade. =World War I= Within a few months after its return from Mexican border service, Troop B was again mobilized due to United States entry into World War I. On September 19, 1917, it was redesignated for federal service as Company B, 116th Train Headquarters and Military Police, 41st Division and deployed to France. In correspondence home in February 1918, Corporal Charles Sweet remarked that: It was redesignated as 217th Company, Military Police Corps on November 1, 1918, and became the 267th Military Police Company on January 15, 1919.

In the article, “Three Paintings by El Greco,” Walter Liedtke theorizes that it was the nephew of Cardinal Guevara, Pedro Lasso, who commissioned his portrait. In Spain during this time it was a novelty to commission a portrait on one's self (outside of courtiers), therefore it is most likely a family member who commissioned this portrait. Conde de Los Arcos (Pedro Lasso), was an established patron of El Greco at the time when this portrait was commissioned. Lasso was a prominent member of the Spanish court and one of the only titled noble members among El Greco's group of friends and acquaintances. At the time of Lasso's death, he is said to have owned seven or eight El Greco paintings, although it is unclear whether the portrait of Cardinal Fernando Nino de Guevara was among this group. The commission of this painting likely occurred in the spring of 1600, when the Cardinal visiting Toledo for several weeks. As Katharine Baetjer notes, Guevara was named cardinal of San Martino ai Monti in 1596 and thereafter traveled to Rome. In 1599, the Cardinal then received a nomination and subsequent promotion to Inquisitor General of Spain, and made a trip to Toledo. It is possible that, during the Cardinal's visit to Toledo, Conde de Los Arcos may have recommended El Greco to his uncle. Although Guevara had siblings who could have commissioned his portrait, during this time, his sister's were dedicated to various convents and his brother, Rodrigo, lived primarily in the Spanish Netherlands and was likely not in Spain often enough to know the prominence and popularity of the work of El Greco. This portrait may have served as a celebration of family pride. Liedtke also notes that, “among the many works of art that Pedro Lasso collected and commissioned were family portraits and portraits of public figures, including famous churchmen and Spanish royalty.” Pedro Lasso may have used this commissions portrait of his uncle as a ‘public gesture,’ and placed it in a “residence, family chapel, or an institution such as a church that he was known to support.” If this portrait was hung in a public space, it would serve two purposes which elevated the family's status, having a prominent member of the church as a relative, and having a well-known artist (who by this time has received at least one commission for King Philip II) paint the portrait. The painting of the novel was fictionalised in the 1936 novel El Greco malt den Großinquisitor by Stefan Andres and the 2007 film El Greco (directed by Yannis Smaragdis) - the latter includes a fictional incident of the cardinal (played by Juan Diego Botto) trying El Greco before the Inquisition.

REMS applies only to specific prescription drugs, but can apply to brand name or generic drugs. The REMS program was formalized in 2007. The FDA determines as part of the drug approvals process that a REMS is necessary, and the drug company develops and maintains the individual program. REMS applies only to specific prescription drugs, but can apply to brand name or generic drugs. REMS for generic drugs may be created in collaboration with the manufacture of the brand name drug. The FDA may remove the REMS requirement if it is found to not improve patient safety. The REMS program developed out of previous systems dating back to the 1980s for monitoring the use of a small number of high-risk drugs such as the Accutane, which causes serious birth defects, Clozaril, which can cause agranulocytosis, and Thalidomide, which is used to treat leprosy but causes serious birth defects. The 2007 Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act created section 505-1 of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act which allowed for the creation of the REMS program for applying individual monitoring restrictions to medications. Some of the provisions required by the REMS program are training and certification of physicians allowed to prescribe the drug, requiring that the drug be administered in a hospital setting, requiring pharmacies to verify the status of patients receiving REMS drugs, requiring lab testing of patients to ensure that health status is satisfactory, or requiring that patients be entered into a registry.  Usage  As of 2018, there are 74 medications subject to REMS monitoring. 62% of these include \\"elements to assure safe use\\". These typically require clinicians or health care institutions to become certified prior to prescribing. 12% include only a \\"communication plan\\" REMS element which is informational in nature.

The film stars Bobby Soto, Cinthya Carmona, George Lopez, and Shia LaBeouf, and follows two enforcers (known as \\"tax collectors\\") working for a Los Angeles crime lord whose business becomes upended, resulting in one of them desperately protecting his family from an old rival. The Tax Collector was released in the United States on August 7, 2020, by RLJE Films, and received negative reviews from critics.  Plot  The film opens with a man named David Cuevas (Bobby Soto) and his wife Alexis (Cinthya Carmona) waking up. She tells him that she had a dream she was walking by the ocean and saw their kids drowning. She tried to save them, but they were trapped under what looked like a sheet of glass. David assures her it was just a dream. Their kids Casey (Aaliyah Lopez) and Dillon (Ricardo Gonzalez) come in to get them out of bed as Alexis’s sister Favi (Lana Parilla) and daughter Jazmin (Gabriela Flores) are coming. David has breakfast with his family before going off to work at a garage he owns. He chastises employee Lupe (Chelsea Rendon) for partying there and smoking weed. David’s partner Creeper (Shia LaBeouf) arrives, and they wait for a guy named Victor (Rene Moran), who is bringing them payment on behalf of his boss Big Lomas. David and Creeper are “tax collectors” for Wizard (Jimmy Smits), the biggest gangster in the area, and they collect a cut of what the other gangs earn through drugs or prostitution. Creeper, known for his violent demeanor, intimidates Victor, but he gives them their payment. The guys then go to David’s uncle Louis (George Lopez) to confirm Victor’s payment. David and Creeper continue about their day with other shady dealings from other gangs. They are called to resolve an issue with one of their guys when they take a Blood member hostage for sleeping with the man’s girlfriend. David comes in to tell them to let the man go before it gets ugly since they have no feud with Bloods. They let the man go and start beating the man who took him for trying to start something. David has the Blood brought back to the other gangsters peacefully while he settles things with their leader, Bone (Cle Sloan). They part on respectful terms after Bone says he wants to squash any beef between their gangs. David is then called by Alexis to handle a situation with a dress that Jazmin wanted for her quinceañera that was already taken by another girl. David goes to the store and promptly handles the issue. When David gets home that night, Alexis tells him that she counted the money from Big Lomas and that it came up short 20 grand. David and Creeper pay Victor a visit and threaten him, but he admits that he skimmed some money because his daughter has leukemia. After Victor proves it, David, being a devoted family man himself, lets Victor live, but he and Creeper take the money after Victor tells them where it is. David gets a text saying a gangster named Venom (Brian Martin Ortega) has 200 grand for them, but when they go to collect it, they are met by Wizard’s rival Conejo (Jose “Conejo” Martin), who says that Venom works for him now, so all the money earned belongs to him. David sits to tell him that he doesn’t know who he’s messing with, but Conejo isn’t afraid of Louis and forces David and Creeper to leave empty-handed. The guys go to Louis to inform him, and Louis says that Conejo and Wizard were rivals, but the former retreated to Mexico up until recently and has always had a reputation as a street terrorist, but in order to get rid of him, Louis needs to put it to a vote within 24 hours, as opposed to Creeper’s desire to just straight-up slaughter Conejo. Before going to bed, David asks Alexis what she saw in him. She knew he was someone she otherwise shouldn’t have been messing with, but she fell in love with him and originally wanted him to kill her abusive alcoholic father, but he got sober and prefers the life they have now. The next day, David is seen going to a self-defense class. The family holds Jazmin’s quince at the Cuevas house. While there, Louis leaves to go meet with Conejo. David’s sister Delia (Noemi Gonzalez) asks him if he has spoken to their father, but David says they don’t want to talk to each other. After David and Alexis share a dance, they are visited by Conejo’s girlfriend Gata (Cheyenne Rae Hernandez), who orders David and Creeper to leave and meet with Conejo. They go to a nightclub where Conejo presents them with Louis’s head and hands in a box. He uses this as incentive to get the guys to work for him, but David and Creeper leave silently. The guys are at the garage discussing plans to kill Conejo, but David doesn’t think it would be wise to go at him straight-on. Gata and some of Conejo’s other men start shooting up the place, killing some of the other men before Gata throws a pipe bomb in there. They capture Creeper but David gets away. He rushes to get Alexis and the kids to safety. As Alexis drives to the kids, David gets a video call from Conejo, where he forces David to watch Gata smashing Creeper’s legs with a hammer before bludgeoning him to death. David takes Alexis to a hotel room with the kids for safety and to arrange to stay with Favi. He leaves her with a gun for protection. He rushes to Lupe and Delia’s place where he digs up a stash of over $1.5 million to get away with Alexis and the kids. Before he leaves, Delia pleads with David not to let Alexis get involved with his business. When he returns to the hotel room, he discovers Alexis dead and the kids missing. He tearfully holds his wife and goes to clean the blood off of her. David later calls Favi and asks if the kids are with her, but she tells him she got a text from Alexis saying she was going to keep them. Conejo then calls David and tells him he has the kids and to meet him in two hours, or he will melt them in acid. Now on his own, David goes to the Blood house and asks Bone for help after telling him what has happened. Without hesitation, Bone gathers volunteers to help David go after Conejo and his men. They hit one of his drug houses and kill all but one of his men. They take him, torture him by dragging his face across the concrete before shooting him in the head after finding Conejo’s address on his phone. They arrive at the house and find Casey and Dillon safe, but nobody else except for Conejo’s grandmother is there. The kids go with Bone’s men, and the grandmother gives up Conejo’s location since she knows what a horrible person he is. Despite David’s objections, Bone is set on helping him see this to the end. David and Bone arrive at Conejo’s place. David strangles a guard while Bone is almost taken in by one of Conejo’s women and a gunman, but he fights and kills both of them. David bursts into Conejo’s room and opens fire, killing Gata while Conejo hides in the bathroom. He shoots at David until David shoots him in the arm, leading to them fighting hand-to-hand. Conejo almost suffocates David until he remembers the words from his self-defense teacher and finds inspiration within himself (in this case, Alexis) to fight back. He overpowers Conejo and smashes his skull with a broken sink. Bone prepares to take David to a friend who can patch him up, but he asks him to pull over briefly so he can call somebody. David calls Wizard, who is revealed to be his father. He thanks David for taking care of Conejo and says he is going to lead the business now, but David rejects any involvement with Wizard. After they hang up, Wizard holds up a rosary and says “Forgive me”.

But there's too little depth to make you care about the characters and too little imagination at work to make The Tax Collector pay.\\" Eric Kohn, of IndieWire, gave the film a \\"D+\\" and wrote, \\"With so much mismatched content and only 90-odd minutes to pull it off, The Tax Collector stuffs in the most exciting showdown into its closing minutes as an afterthought.\\"  References   External links  * Category:2020 films Category:2020 thriller films Category:2020 action thriller films Category:2020s buddy films Category:2020s crime thriller films Category:American films Category:American action thriller films Category:American buddy drama films Category:American crime thriller films Category:Hood films Category:Films shot in Los Angeles Category:Films directed by David Ayer Category:Films with screenplays by David Ayer Category:Films scored by Michael Yezerski ","title":"The Tax Collector"},{"id":"57742628","text":"Akanbi Wright who was also known as Akanbi Ege was a Nigerian musician from Lagos and an important figure in the early history of juju music, he was instrumental in the popular use of talking drums within that music genre.

Her areas of specialization include the history of philosophy, philosophical anthropology, philosophy of woman, existentialism, and personalism. Areas of competence include metaphysics, philosophy of God, epistemology and logic. Biography Allen was born Christine Hope Allen in Oneida, New York, on July 21, 1940.

She describes feminism as type of humanism and coined the term \\"personalist feminism.\\"Allen, Sister Mary Prudence. “Can Feminism be a Humanism,”in Women in Christ: Toward a New Feminism. Michele Schumacher, ed. (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2003): 251-284, 280-81. The philosophy of the human person and of human community is a major focus of her writing. She agrees with Aristotle's understanding of the relationship between soul and body, as well as his approach to science, but opposes his view that human males are superior to females. Like other feminists, she wants to eliminate the discrimination and violence that many women face, but, as a New or Personalist Feminist, she opposes abortion.. She also argues that gender identity is properly based on sex, that there is a conflict between gender reality and gender ideology, and that gender reality needs to be regained.Allen, Sister Mary Prudence. 2014. “Gender Reality,” Solidarity: The Journal of Catholic Social Thought and Secular Ethics: Vol. 4: Iss. 1, Article 1. Available at: http://researchonline.nd.edu.au/solidarity/vol4/iss1/1; “Gender Reality vs. Gender Ideology,” in John P. Hittinger and Daniel C. Wagner, Thomas Aquinas: Teacher of Humanity: Proceedings from the First Conference of the Pontifical Academy of St. Thomas Aquinas held in the United States of America (Cambridge: Scholars Publishinig, 2015). Allen's three-volume magnum opus, The Concept of Woman, is the culmination of a lifetime of the scholarly investigation into how womanhood has been understood throughout the history of philosophy. Allen argues that there has been a true development in the understanding of gender leading to integral complementarity. This understanding builds upon the thought of Aristotle and Augustine. She discusses three understandings of gender throughout history: gender polarity, gender unity, and gender complementarity. Gender polarity can appear either in its traditional form, in which men are considered superior to women, or in a reversed form, in which women are seen as superior. In its traditional form, gender polarity became dominant in philosophical circles for centuries under the influence of Aristotle. Gender unity holds that there are no significant differences between men and women. Gender complementarity can appear in one of two forms—fractional complementarity, in which men and women form two halves of a whole, and integral complementarity, in which men and women are whole on their own and together form something greater than two wholes.. Allen holds to the integral complementarity position..

The head of government is Andrej Babiš, leader of ANO. The cabinet was approved by the Chamber of Deputies on 12 July 2018 with a 105–91 vote. Background The general election in 2017 was won by ANO, led by Andrej Babiš, who received 78 seats out of 200, becoming the largest party. President Miloš Zeman appointed Babiš to form a government with other parties, but all other parliamentary parties had ruled out forming a coalition government with ANO due to a police investigation into Babiš's alleged subsidy fraud. In early 2018, Babiš lost a confidence vote when other parties voted against an ANO- minority government. In 2018, ČSSD decided to hold coalition talks with ANO. In April, the negotiations broke down. President Miloš Zeman subsequently gave Babiš a second chance to form a government. In May, ČSSD accepted talks with ANO, with KSČM also participating in talks to determine the conditions for its support of an ANO-ČSSD government. Government formation The cabinet consists of two coalition parties. ANO, the senior coalition partner in the government, has 10 ministers (including Prime Minister). The Social Democrats have four ministers and hold five ministries, due to the refusal of Czech President Miloš Zeman to appoint Miroslav Poche, the party's nominee for Foreign Minister. Jan Hamáček was appointed as temporary Foreign Minister. The coalition holds 93 seats in the Chamber of Deputies, eight seats short of a simple majority of 101 seats. The coalition therefore requires the support of another party to provide confidence and supply. KSČM agreed to support the minority government in exchange for cabinet support for several of their demands. With KSČM support, the government controls a majority of 108 seats. On June 15, 2018, following a party referendum, ČSSD formed a coalition with ANO. The cabinet was approved by the Chamber of Deputies in the early morning of 12 July 2018 with a 105-91 vote, during a parliamentary session which had begun the previous morning. During the debate, deputies from TOP 09 left the Chamber in protest (they later returned to vote against the government) while some deputies from the Christian and Democratic Union – Czechoslovak People's Party unfurled a soviet flag to protest against the government being supported by the Communist Party. Protests also took place in the streets of Prague against the role of the Communists in the government. Resignations over plagiarism Shortly after the formation of the cabinet, two ministers – Taťána Malá of ANO and Petr Krčál of ČSSD – resigned after being accused of plagiarism in their bachelor theses.Second minister resigns over allegations of plagiarism On July 24, 2018, another minister, Lubomír Metnar (Independent for ANO) also came under suspicion of plagiarism in his diploma thesis.

Hail! is a novella written by Harry Turtledove. It was published in e-book format by Swallow's End Publishing, June 5, 2018. Plot summary Shortly after the release of their film Duck Soup in mid-1934, the Marx Brothers eventually visit Nacogdoches, Texas and all four of them get caught in a lightning storm that transports them back in time to December 15, 1826 and arrive in the same town just as when the Fredonian Rebellion is breaking out. Having just completed their film Duck Soup, about a fictional Republic of Freedonia, the brothers actually know about the Fredonian Rebellion in some detail, particularly Julius \\"Groucho\\" Marx, who serves as the story's point of view. When they encounter Adolphus Sterne, the man who supplied the Rebellion, the Marx Brothers, despairing of ever returning to their own time, reveal their identity to Sterne, and agree to help the rebellion. This decision proves to have dire consequences for history resulting in the creation of a slave-holding \\"Confederal government\\" with a flag consisting of a white St. Andrew's Cross and 15 red stars well into the 20th century.

Whilst in Malta, Gargallo ruled with fear, to the point where no one dared to stand up to him. Consequently, there were clashes with the Inquisition in Malta and he was suspended by Inquisitor Cefalotto in 1582, as a result of his harsh rule. Gargallo also experienced financial difficulties whilst Bishop of Malta. Gargallo welcomed the newly formed order of the Jesuits to Malta. He also established a number of parishes, notably, St Paul's parish, St Dominic's parish and Our Lady of Damascus Greek Catholic parish, all in Valletta.

Independent district 28 senate candidate Mark Syms, husband of representative Maria Syms, was removed from the ballot after a Superior Court judge determined that his petitions contained over 900 forged voter signatures. This followed reports that incumbent district 28 state senator Kate Brophy McGee was supporting house candidate Kathy Petsas.

The geographical coordinates of the plant are 0°19'06.0\\"N, 32°36'27.0\\"E (Latitude:0.318333; Longitude:32.607500). Overview The Bugoloobi WTP, collects wastewater and sewerage from parts of the city, including Old Kampala, Mengo, Katwe, Nsambya, Kibuli, Mbuya, Nakawa, Naguru, Bukoto and Kamwookya. The new expanded STP is aimed at increasing and improving sanitation services in the city and reducing the pollution of the Nakivubo Channel, a surface-water effluent into Lake Victoria, thereby increasing the lake's environmental sustainability. The project involves the construction of an ultra-modern sewerage treatment plant in Bugoloobi, a sewerage pre- treatment plant in Kinawattaka, a sewerage pumping station on Kibira Road and a sewer network measuring . New areas to be added to the sewerage network include Bugoloobi, Kyambogo, Kasokoso, Kinnawattaka, Banda, Butabika and neighbouring areas. The bio-digesters in this plant, are expected to generate gases, which will be heated to generate of electricity, to be used internally in the plant. In addition, the solid wastes removed from the wastewater, are expected to be dried and sold as fertilizer, or as raw material for the manufacture of cooking briquettes. Ownership The water treatment facility is wholly owned by the National Water and Sewerage Corporation (NWSC), a government parastatal company, responsible for provision of potable water and sewerage services nationwide. Construction Construction began in May 2014, and is expected to conclude in 2018. NWSC plans to construct new sewerage treatment plants in Nalukolongo, between Ndeeba and Nateete, along the Kampala–Masaka Road and in Kajjansi, in addition the one in Lubigi, completed in 2014. Financing This project has received funding from (a) the government of Uganda, (b) the African Development Bank (c) the European Union and (d) KfW.

It received a developmental run from August 31, 2017 to October 15, 2017 on Stage 773 in Chicago, after several workshopping sessions at The Chicago Musical Theater Festival at Victory Gardens, The Los Angeles LGBT Arts Center, and at the Marriott Theater in Chicago. Synopsis Act I The musical begins with an elderly Albert Cashier remembering his youth as a soldier in the Civil War (\\"Ghost Boy\\"). A flashback is shown about Young Albert enlisting into Company G of the 95th Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment, where Sergeant Collins is mustering troops (\\"Battle Cry of Freedom\\"). Young Albert meets several other men, including Billy Middleton, Walter Suiter, and Jeffrey N. Davis. Young Albert then ponders his potential, and how he will impact on the war (\\"Bullet in a Gun\\"). The flashback ends, revealing an older Cashier, still refusing to receive a bath. Albert appears to liken this to a skirmish he experienced, and we see Young Albert and fellow soldiers fighting Confederate troops (\\"I'm Alive\\"). Young Albert impresses his newfound friends with his use of a rife, but is ultimately knocked unconscious by a rebel. Jeffrey N. Davis pulls him off the field to safety. Older Albert becomes confused as he tries to remember his childhood in Ireland, when the only person he remembers is a small girl (\\"What is Real?\\"). Nurse Smith enters, and attempts to get Albert to take a bath, but he refuses. He is saved by his doctor, who is concerned about Albert's mental state as well as physical health, and orders the nurse to give Albert a steak each Friday to strengthen his constitution. Young Albert sits at a fire with the African-American soldier Walter Suiter, and they argue about whether a rainstorm is coming. Young Albert laughs off Walter's conviction, and tactlessly says \\"That's your imagination-but then again I had always heard you slaves were full of imagination.\\" Walter replies that he is not, or ever was, a slave, and rain begins to pour (\\"Following the Sound\\"). Young Albert meets Jeffrey again, is exasperated by his constant nervous chatter, but declares each other friends(\\"Brothers in Arms\\"). Back in 1901, Albert is brought his weekly steak by hospital attendant John Curtis, who tells him about his dream to go to Chicago and sing (\\"Chicago\\"). Nurse Smith comes in to see John singing and dancing, and fires him for unprofessional behavior. Albert gives John money for a train to Chicago, and he leaves. Back in 1863, the Siege of Vicksburg is commencing, and the soldiers see death for the first time (\\"Civilized\\"). Walter is shot and killed during the battle, as well as Billy Middleton and Sergeant Collins. Afterwards, only Albert and Jeffery remain. Jeffery leaves to fight the last several Confederate soldiers, and Albert is left alone and taken captive (\\"Better\\"). The perspective changes back to the elderly Albert, who is appalled to hear he has been taken by a new doctor, who had ordered for him to be bathed. One of the hospital attendants gives Albert a drug that renders him comatose as Nurse Smith prepares to give him a bath. As she takes off his clothing, she sees that he has breasts. Act II The second act begins with both Alberts lamenting how they can never live in peace if they choose to live as themselves (\\"Praying for the Light\\"). Albert is in court being tried for impersonating a man and defrauding the federal government. The judge mocks Albert and tells him one of the witnesses coming to testify is Jeffrey N. Davis, who Albert has not seen in over 40 years. The scene changes to show Young Albert tied to a chair and being interrogated by two Confederate officers, and escaping(\\"What Will You Fight For?\\"). Meanwhile, Jeffrey is searching for Albert across the Mason- Dixie line, and begins to question whether he thinks of Albert as more than a friend, and comes to terms with his love for him (\\"Excuse Me, Sir\\"). Older Albert is being held in the hospital as the trial progresses, and is visited by Nurse Smith, who tries to convince him to give up acting like a man so he can be acquitted. He refuses, and she leaves angrily (\\"Woman to Woman\\"). Young Albert and Jeffrey find each other, and Jeffrey discovers Albert is not cisgender and proposes marriage to him, but Albert declines (\\"Perfect Home\\"). A bugle boy locates them and announces that the war is over. As Jeffrey rushes away to go prepare to go back to Belvidere, Albert contemplates his future, and how he could never be satisfied living as a woman (\\"I Gotta Try\\"). He runs away to create his own future, leaving Jeffrey behind. 40 years later, they meet again, and reflect fondly with each other. Albert's trial continues, and many of his fellow soldiers testify that he is a man, and the charge is dropped due to insufficient evidence. Nurse Smith returns, and takes Albert to the Watertowm State Hospital for the Insane, due to one of her attendants reporting him. Albert is forced to wear a dress and corset, which restricts his breathing and strains his body to the point of killing him (\\"Breathe. Walk. Home.\\"). His funeral is attended by soldiers from his regiment, and Jeffrey, who demands Albert be buried in his uniform. The play ends with Young Albert singing, \\"I can't deny, I heard the call.\\" (\\"Finale\\") Musical Numbers Act I * Ghost Boy- Albert and Young Albert * Battlecry of Freedom- Sergeant Collins, Young Albert, ensemble * Bullet in a Gun- Young Albert * I'm Alive- Albert, Young Albert, ensemble * What is Real- Albert * Following the Sound- Walter Suiter * Brothers in Arms- Young Albert, Jeffrey, ensemble * Chicago- John Curtis * Civilized- Walter, Sergeant Collins, Young Albert, ensemble * Better- Young Albert, ensemble Act II * Praying for the Light- Albert, Young Albert * What Will You Fight For?- Young Albert, Albert, ensemble * Excuse Me, Sir- Jeffrey * Woman to Woman- Nurse Smith, Albert * Perfect Home- Jeffrey, Young Albert * I Gotta Try- Young Albert * Breathe.

It is some 4000 to 5000 years old; however the reference to King Orry is to the 11th century local ruler Godred Crovan, who has a number of supposed burial places. Like Cashtal yn Ard, the structure is a multi-chambered Clyde cairn of coloured sandstone. The eastern part is semi-circular with a diameter of 12 m and a depth of 4 m. The eastern section is a row of three burial chambers. At the western end is a separate cist-like structure, excavated in 1930, with a menhir.

It's a compilation album, and shares the same concept with 1976's Ship of Memories. A total of 15 previously unreleased tracks and alternate versions are included on this set. Track listing  Production  From the CD's liner notes  Disc one   \\"Nature Is Our Friend\\"  The first of solo pieces by Thijs, recorded in early 2017 on his 1989 Muramatsu flute, especially for The Focus Family Album. Recorded by Geert Scheijgrond.  \\"Song for Eva\\"  The second of two tracks recorded during the Focus X sessions, but not included, due to its long length on an album which already flowed well. Eva is Thijs's second eldest daughter and the spoken word portion comes from «They Say That Hope Is Happiness» by Lord Byron (1788-1824).  \\"Riverdance\\"  The first piece from Pierre's Drum Poetry, an album he initially made for friends only from sessions to experiment into his own playing skills and techniques. Recorded by Marlies Helder.  \\"Victoria\\"  This is a vocal remix of the Focus X album track, which is also a shorter edit, previously unreleased until its appearance here.  \\"Two-part Intervention\\"  The first of two acoustic guitar tracks by Menno, which were recorded in June 2017 for inclusion on this compilation, a couple of weeks after the end of the Focus 11 sessions. It's called Two-Part Intervention because the piece two voices counter-parting, based on how Bach's two part Inventions. Menno commented «But I liked the word Intervention better, and I’m no Bach!».  \\"Mosh Blues\\"  When Focus is on tour in South America, the members often draw on the beautiful surroundings as inspiration to write new material, such as at MOSH Studios in São Paulo, on 18 March 2012. These writing and jamming sessions are usually with a view to later recording any material on future projects, but this instrumental was advanced enough to be mixed for release in its original form.  \\"Raga Reverence 1\\"  A track from second Swung album, simply called «Vol. 2», which features Bobby Jacobs, Pierre van der Linden and Menno Gootjes.  \\"The Fifth Man\\"  A track from the second Mosh Studios sessions on 13 April 2014. At one point these tracks were considered for «Focus 11», before being mixed for an EP, but that ideas ultimately merged into the ideas for The Focus Family Album.  \\"Song for Yaminah\\"  Dutch bass player Udo joined Focus in November 2016 and introduces his playing to the band's catalogue with two bass pieces recorded in June 2017. The song is dedicated to his one and only love.  \\"Clair- Obscur\\"  The first of two tracks from «Focus 11», these are a rare opportunity to hear early band reference mixes which are usually keep private. These two tracks are the very first view into the sessions for the album. Clair-Obscure is a technique in the art of painting, film of photography where the contrast of light and dark is stronger than reality.  Disc two   \\"Let us Wander\\"  The second of the flute pieces, which give us the opportunity to hear how Thijs carries his flute around on days off between shows, playing in nature when the moment inspires him. Recorded by Geert Scheijgrond.  \\"Birds Come Fly Over (Le Tango)\\"  This track was included on the Focus X album, with lead vocals by guest singer Ivan Lins, but this is an unreleased version including the original vocal track by Thijs.  \\"Spiritual Swung\\"  The second piece from the Drum Poetry album, which has no connection with the band Swung, and is another experiment by Pierre as reexamines his own playing. Recorded by Marlies Helder.  \\"Santa Theresa\\"  The first of two tracks recorded during the Focus X sessions, but not included on the album. This track was later included on the Focus X album as a bonus track in Japan only.  \\"Hazel\\"  The second of Menno's acoustic pieces to showcase his skill as an acoustic guitar player. This piece is inspired by the hazel colored eyes, rather than a person by that name.  \\"Fine Without You\\"  This take takes Mosh Blues and adds lead vocals by guest vocalist Jo de Roeck, who previously sang on Just Like Eddy during the \\"Focus 9 / New Skin\\" sessions. The vocal session was recorded on 11 June 2013.  \\"Raga Reverence 5\\"  The concept of the band Swung was to experiment and improvise during Focus soundcheck and downtime, before Thijs arrived, which resulted in various innovative improvised recordings by the trio.  \\"Five Fourth\\"  This track was written by Thijs and who brought manuscripts with him to the Mosh 2014 session and the band sight read the piece as they played it. Five-Four was recorded in that first take.  \\"Anaya\\"  Uno plays a custom built six string bass guitar on these tracks, which he has been playing since 1994. Anaya is the 9-year-old daughter of Yaminah.  \\"Winnie\\"  The second of two tracks that are the very first view into the sessions for the Focus 11 album. Winnie is named for Menno's daughter.

Less than 300 of them survive in both states combined, in three different populations of 100 each; one in northern California, one straddling the California-Oregon border, and one in Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area. The subspecies was in fact considered extinct until being rediscovered in the Six Rivers National Forest in 1996. They are most threatened by a lack of population expansion and by human-caused mortalities, including trapping and road mortality. While California has already banned all commercial trapping of martens, Oregon still permits it. In response, environmental organizations seek a ban on trapping west of Interstate 5. However, in California itself the marten is threatened by the increasing number of marijuana farms destroying its habitat in the area. In Washington, martens breed in alpine forests.

It was initially formed in October 1943 as the Queensland People's Party (QPP), which then absorbed the disbanded Queensland branch of the United Australia Party in 1944. In 1945, the QPP had an agreement with the newly formed Liberal Party, where in the \\"federal sphere\\", QPP would be the Queensland division of the Liberal Party and would run its candidates under the Liberal Party banner in federal elections. However, in the \\"state sphere\\", it would continue to exist individually under its own banner. In July 1949, the QPP was renamed to reflect its status as the Queensland division of the Liberal Party. Based predominantly in Brisbane and other cities in Queensland, from 1957 it held power as the junior party in a coalition with the state Country Party, later the National Party, until 1983 when the Liberals broke away and went into opposition. The party formed another coalition with the Nationals that took power in 1996 but was defeated in 1998. After a further decade in opposition, in 2008, the two parties merged to form the Liberal National Party of Queensland. History The centre-right in Queensland has a long history of splits and mergers, with much debate over whether to have a single party aiming to cover the whole state or to have distinctive voices for the metropolitan and rural areas. The Liberal Party was formed after a period that had seen three mergers and three splits in the preceding thirty years. Throughout its history it was beset by the question of relations with the Country/National Party until the two merged. Origins John Beals Chandler, the sitting Lord Mayor of Brisbane, was elected to the state parliament as an independent in the 1943 Hamilton state by-election on 9 October 1943. At the time the conservative forces in the parliament were united as the Country-National Organisation but this was under much pressure to split back into separate rural and urban parties which would happen the following year. Chandler disagreed with the Labor Party's collectivism, instead advocating mass capitalism and class-free politics, and this led him to found the Queensland People's Party (QPP) on 26 October 1943. The Country- National Organisation split up the following year, with the urban section once more becoming the state branch of the United Australia Party. However, by then the UAP was in terminal decline at all levels. The Queensland UAP was soon absorbed by Chandler's party.John Laverty, 'Chandler, Sir John Beals (1887–1962)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/chandler-sir-john-beals-9724/text17171, published first in hardcopy 1993, accessed online 22 June 2018. At the 1944 state election the party won seven seats, all in Brisbane. The Queensland People's Party contested elections in South East Queensland. Affiliation with the Liberal Party The following year, the national UAP was folded into the Liberal Party, and by April 1945, 17 non-Labor forces in Queensland joined the Liberal Party. However, the QPP declined to dissolve itself and join the Liberal Party, leading the Liberal Party the possibility to have to organise its own Queensland division. However, in May 1945, the QPP eventually reached an agreement with the Liberal Party, where the QPP agreed to become the local apparatus of the Liberal Party for federal elections. That meant in the \\"federal sphere\\" or relating to federal matters, QPP would be the Queensland division of the Liberal Party. During federal elections, QPP candidates would run under the Liberal Party banner and were bound by the Liberal Party policy and platform. In the \\"state sphere\\", QPP would run candidates under its own banner in state elections and were bound by QPP policy and platform. All candidates would be selected by a joint executive consisting of the state provisional executive of the Liberal Party and QPP representatives. Chandler was succeeded as leader in 1946 by Bruce Pie, a fellow Brisbane based businessman, who led the party to an increase to nine seats in the 1947 state election, offering a bold reform policy that at times clashed with the Country Party's aims.Paul D. Williams, 'Pie, Arthur Bruce (1902–1962)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/pie-arthur-bruce-11392/text20355, published first in hardcopy 2000, accessed online 22 June 2018. However both Chandler and Pie had business concerns, as well as the former's continued local government role, that meant they could not devote all their time to leading the party. Thomas Hiley took over the leadership in 1948.Manfred Cross, 'Hiley, Sir Thomas Alfred (Tom) (1905–1990)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/hiley-sir-thomas-alfred-tom-12634/text22763, published first in hardcopy 2007, accessed online 22 June 2018. Since 1946, there were attempts to rename the QPP to the Liberal Party, including an unsuccessful attempt in October 1948. Hiley was also opposed to a name change. In November 1948, the party expressed its intention to merge with the Country Party, with a potential name \\"Liberal-Country Party League\\", similar to the Liberal and Country League in South Australia. However, this was refused by the Country Party as mergers with other parties would violate its party constitution. On 8 July 1949, QPP delegates agreed to a name change and the QPP was renamed Liberal Party of Australia (Queensland Division) to be in line with other Liberal Party state divisions. Relations with the Country Party remained uneasy for much of the next decade through the leaderships of Hiley and then Kenneth Morris and it was not until 1956 that they were firmly settled.Stevenson, Brian \\"Frank Nicklin and the Coalition Government, 1957-1968\\", in Journal of the Royal Historical Society of Queensland volume 13 issue 11: page 404 Although the party polled between 20% and 30% of the vote over successive elections, it could not elect more than 11 members and was further hampered by the introduction of a malapportionment in 1949 that strengthened both the Labor and Country parties. The party was also almost entirely limited to electoral success in Brisbane, apart from the seat of East Toowoomba/Lockyer where future leader Gordon Chalk had gained the seat in 1947 and followed the rural parts in a redistribution. Coalition government 1957-1983 In 1957 the Labor Party in Queensland was engulfed in the split that had been growing in the party across Australia over the influence of communism. The sitting Premier Vince Gair was expelled from the party and led a breakaway Queensland Labor Party that sought to retain office.B. J. Costar, 'Gair, Vincent Clare (Vince) (1901–1980)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/gair-vincent-clare-vince-10267/text18159, published first in hardcopy 1996, accessed online 20 June 2018. However, when the state parliament resumed sitting, the Liberal, Country and rump Labor parties combined to block supply, bringing down the Gair government and leading to the 1957 state election at which the Country and Liberal coalition won power after a quarter of a century. The Liberals were still the smaller of the two coalition parties in the state parliament despite polling more votes, a position that was reinforced when the new government modified the malapportionment to its advantage despite some Liberal opposition.Stevenson, Brian \\"Frank Nicklin and the Coalition Government, 1957-1968\\", in Journal of the Royal Historical Society of Queensland volume 13 issue 11: page 405 Later in 1962 the Liberals secured the reintroduction of preferential voting which would allow the non-Labor vote to combine but also in the long term allowed for the two coalition parties to contest seats against one another.Stevenson, Brian \\"Frank Nicklin and the Coalition Government, 1957-1968\\", in Journal of the Royal Historical Society of Queensland volume 13 issue 11: page 408 However, for much of the first decade in power relations between the two coalition parties held well, helped by a determination to maintain the relation by Premier and Country Party leader Frank Nicklin and a succession of Liberal leaders including Kenneth Morris, Alan Munro, a brief return by Thomas Hiley and Gordon Chalk. In 1959 a Liberal convention passed a resolution to offer to merge with the Country Party \\"on any reasonable terms\\", but the latter rejected both this and a further offer in 1963. However tensions started growing on several fronts, which put pressure on the traditional allocation of seats between the two partners. Brisbane's growth was rapidly spilling onto the Redcliffe Peninsula, and the Gold Coast was also seeing growing urbanisation. Additionally, the Liberals were setting up new branches in traditional Country Party areas.Stevenson, Brian \\"Frank Nicklin and the Coalition Government, 1957-1968\\", in Journal of the Royal Historical Society of Queensland volume 13 issue 11: pages 407-408 The 1966 state election saw the Country and Liberal parties stand against each other in eight seats, but none changed between the coalition partners.Stevenson, Brian \\"Frank Nicklin and the Coalition Government, 1957-1968\\", in Journal of the Royal Historical Society of Queensland volume 13 issue 11: pages 409-411 Relations deteriorated during the premiership of Nicklin's longterm successor, Joh Bjelke-Petersen. The parties got off to a poor start when the previous premier, Jack Pizzey, died suddenly and Liberal leader Gordon Chalk was appointed as a temporary successor until the Country Party elected a new leader but at first tried to retain the office for himself until Bjelke-Petersen threatened to break up the coalition.Rae Wear, 'Chalk, Gordon William (Chalkie) (1913–1991)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/chalk-gordon-william- chalkie-15168/text26356, published online 2014, accessed online 20 June 2018. Bjelke-Petersen also moved to refine the malapportionment further, now dubbed the \\"Bjelkemander\\", which reinforced the Country Party's superior position. However steady urbanisation in the state increased pressure on relations between the parties as traditional Country Party areas turned into Liberal targets. An early conflict came in the Albert by-election in 1970. The electoral district of Albert, based around the Gold Coast, had been in Country Party hands since 1936 but over the 1960s saw increased electoral pressure from first independents and then the Liberals. The by-election saw the Country Party vote collapse and the Liberals take the seat, contributing to a challenge against Bjelke-Petersen though he narrowly survived a leadership challenge. There was little electoral change in the 1969 and 1972 state elections, but in the next few years the Country Party became increasingly assertive, changing its name to the \\"National Party\\" (a name adopted by its federal counterpart in 1982), standing in more urban seats and increasingly taking on the federal Whitlam government as part of greater assertiveness. The 1974 state election saw the Labor Party routed with both National and Liberal parties picking up seats. With Labor increasingly unviable as a party of government, conflict between the two coalition parties increased as they stood against each other in more and more seats. The Liberals were outpolled by the Nationals at the 1977 state election and subsequently diminished in influence in the cabinet. In government itself the two parties held together, with the Liberals suffering increasing division over tactics between the parliamentary leadership, the backbenchers and the extra-parliamentary party. Chalk had retired in 1976, succeeded by William Knox who lasted just over two years before being replaced by Llewellyn Edwards. However, despite backbench demands for a stronger Liberal approach, the leadership felt unable to deliver it. At the 1980 state election the Nationals gained further seats at the expense of the Liberals, with tensions building further. The breakdown in relations spilled over in federal politics, leading to the two parties running competing Senate tickets at the 1980 federal election, costing the Coalition a seat and thus its majority. A growing group of Liberal members of parliament dubbed the \\"Ginger Group\\" increasingly challenged both their own leadership and the Nationals. In 1982 Angus Innes challenged Edwards for the leadership, despite Bjelke-Petersen declaring he would prefer a minority government to a coalition with Innes, and only narrowly lost by 12:10. Matters boiled over the following year when Terry White, the Liberal Minister for Welfare Services, voted against the government line in a debate on creating a public accounts committee to monitor public spending. This was in line with Liberal policy but against the government position, although White disputed the latter point. White was sacked from the government and successfully challenged Edwards for the leadership, with Innes elected as deputy. Bjelke-Petersen refused to appoint White as Deputy Premier, prompting White to tear up the Coalition agreement and lead the Liberals to the crossbench. The Nationals governed as a minority for a few months until the 1983 state election at which the Liberals were reduced to a mere eight seats. The Nationals were one seat short of an outright majority and soon two Liberals, Brian Austin and Don Lane, switched to the Nationals, supplying them with a majority to govern in their own right. The long path to merger Terry White was soon deposed as leader and replaced by the return of William Knox. However the Liberals were unable to recover much ground at the 1986 election which saw the Nationals consolidate their position and win an outright majority. Angus Innes became leader in 1988 as the National government was in decline, but proved unable to make any headway in the 1989 election which saw Labor take power for the first time in over thirty years. The new Labor government of Wayne Goss dismantled the \\"Bjelkemander\\" and as a result Brisbane now elected nearly half the state parliament. Furthermore, the preferential voting system was changed to optional preferencing, making it harder for the Nationals and Liberals to contest the same seats without risking loss to Labor. These changes would have the effect of altering the relationship between the two parties as the Nationals could no longer seek government in their own right but the Liberals initially instead sought to achieve senior status and steadily replaced the Nationals as the main conservative party on first the Sunshine Coast and then the Gold Coast. The Liberals elected their first female leader, Joan Sheldon, who was seen as less hostile to the National Party than Innes, but the parties contested the 1992 election separately and made no real advance. Two months after the election, Sheldon and Nationals leader Rob Borbidge signed a new coalition agreement, allowing them to present a united front in the 1995 election. The initial results saw Labor retain power with a one-seat majority, but this was overturned when the result in one seat was declared void and the Liberals won the subsequent by-election. With the support of an independent, the National-Liberal coalition took power, holding it until 1998. However the coalition faced a strong threat from the rise of Pauline Hanson's One Nation party that challenged on issues such as multiculturalism, gun ownership and native title. One Nation's appeal resonated well the Nationals' heartland of rural and regional Queensland. The Coalition also suffered a backlash against the introduction of gun control laws after the Port Arthur massacre. At the 1998 election the Coalition lost much support to One Nation and fell from power. The election also saw the Liberals poll more votes than the Nationals for the first time in over a quarter of a century despite the latter winning more seats and this outcome would recur for the next decade. However they remained behind in seats and conflicting approaches to One Nation voters and transfers meant the two parties were undermining each other's approach. At the 2001 election, the Coalition only suffered a two-percent swing. However, the Liberals were all but wiped out in Brisbane, falling to only one seat there, that of leader David Watson. They only won two other seats in that election, those of Shelton and Bob Quinn, who replaced Watson as leader after the election. This was easily the worst showing for the urban non-Labor party in Queensland since it adopted the Liberal banner. The next seven years saw the Liberals in the awkward position of having been incredibly weakened by both the Nationals and Labor but also facing a potentially easier route to senior status over the Nationals, as the latter had been almost wiped out on the Gold and Sunshine Coasts with the Liberals starting to retake the seats. The party made only limited advances at the 2004 and 2006 elections. While it seemed increasingly likely the Liberals would be the larger party in any future coalition government, it also presented the awkward question of which party leader would be Premier, a question that Bruce Flegg, who replaced Quinn as leader in 2006, struggled to answer. A proposal was made in 2005 to merge the two parties but this provoked much opposition, including from the federal governing coalition. Following the federal defeat in the 2007 election and the proposal was revived, and in July 2008 under leader Mark McArdle the party agreed to merge with the Nationals as the Liberal National Party, with McArdle as the merged party's deputy leader. The merged party has full voting rights with the Liberal Party and observer status with the National Party, even though at the time more of its elected members were former Nationals. The merged party has so far lasted a decade, but from time to time calls are made for the parties to demerge from both Liberals and Nationals. John-Paul Langbroek, from the Liberal side of the merger, took over the leadership following the resignation of founding leader Lawrence Springborg. It was the first time in 84 years that the non-Labor side in Queensland had been led by someone aligned federally with the Liberals or their predecessors. Langbroek gave way in 2011 to another former Liberal, Brisbane Lord Mayor Campbell Newman, who led the party to a record landslide victory in 2012, including all but three seats in Brisbane. The LNP was rolled out of office after only one term in 2015. Brisbane city government As well as state elections, the Liberals also regularly contested the elections for the City of Brisbane, the largest local authority in Australia. The position of Lord Mayor of Brisbane was made a directly elected one in 1982, with the Liberals first winning the post in the 1985 election with Sallyanne Atkinson. The party also won a majority on the council and held both in the 1988 election. Following Atkinson's defeat in the 1991 election, the Liberals did not win the mayoralty again until the 2004 election when Campbell Newman won the post but with a Labor majority on the council. Newman was re-elected in 2008, this time with a Liberal majority on the council. Leaders {  - ! Leader ! Date started !

Life and career Papadopoulos was born on the Aegean island of Kea. Kea was among the islands occupied for several years by the Russians during the Russo-Turkish War of 1768–1774, before they were returned to Ottoman control in the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca. Papadopoulos, who must have been around fifteen at the time, probably accompanied the departing Russians. He was educated in the Greek Gymnasium established by Grigory Potemkin and attached to the Engineering and Artillery Gentry Corps. In 1781 he entered the officer corps. During the Russo-Turkish War of 1787–1792, he took part in the Siege of Ochakov (1788) and other battles against the Ottomans. For his distinguished actions near Koushan, he was promoted to the general staff. Upon the conclusion of peace with the Sublime Porte, Papadopoulos accompanied the Russian ambassador to Constantinople and composed a description of the two major roads leading to the city. With the outbreak of the War of the Third Coalition in 1803, Papadopoulos formed a battalion and an artillery command with twelve guns from the garrison of Kamenets, with which he went to Corfu (part of the Russian- dominated Septinsular Republic). There in 1804 he was engaged in organizing the Republic's regular army, the Greek Legion. In the same year he was promoted to major general. In 1804 he also published in Corfu, in Greek and Italian, a military manual for the instruction of the Greeks in modern warfare (Διδασκαλία στρατιωτική προς χρήσιν των Ελλήνων, \\"Military Teaching for the use of the Greeks\\"). In 1805, he published the Legion's regulations (Ερμηνεία της συνισταμένης Λεγεώνος των Ηπειρωτο-Σουλιωτών και Χιμαρο-Πελοποννησίων, \\"Explanation of the combined Legion of Epirote-Souliots and Himariot- Peloponnesians\\"), where he exhorted its readers to remember that they are descendants of the ancient Greeks, to emulate the deeds of the celebrated Pyrrhus and Skanderbeg, and bring new glory to the Greek name. In autumn 1805 he led the troops of the Greek Legion to participate in the Anglo-Russian invasion of Naples, alongside 14,000 Russian and 10,000 British troops. The expedition was cut short, however, by Napoleon's decisive victory at the Battle of Austerlitz in December. In February 1806, the Anglo-Russians were forced to abandon the Italian mainland to the French. In 1806 he commanded the Russian forces operating at the Bay of Kotor. He particularly distinguished himself in the capture of Castelnuovo on 19 September 1806, after a seven-hour battle. In late 1806 he was named colonel-in-chief of the . Taking command of the regiment and all the Greek troops in the Ionian Islands, he successfully countered the threat of Ali Pasha of Ioannina. He established three legions at the mainland outpost of Parga in 1807, and organized the defences at Lefkada (Santa Maura), threatened by Ali Pasha with attack. Following the Peace of Tilsit (1807), with his regiment he returned to Russia via Austria. He joined the Russian Army of the Danube during the Russo-Turkish War of 1806–1812, and distinguished himself again in several combats with the Turks, until his death in battle before Shumla on 11 June 1810. His epitaph was delivered by the Orthodox Metropolitan of Ungro-Wallachia, Ignatios II. It was published by the Greek scholar Periklis Zerlentis in 1887. Family Papadopoulos had no sons, but his daughter Maria Emmanuilovna (died 1873) became a notable presence in Odessa for her numerous charitable works.

Douglas McGee (1926-1993) was a 20th-Century American professor of philosophy at Bowdoin College. Background Charles Douglas McGee was born in 1926. He spent his early years in Oklahoma and served in Army infantry during World War II. In 1949, he graduated from Northwestern University and in 1950 obtained an MA. In 1957, he received a doctorate from Harvard University. Career McGee taught at Vassar College for nearly 10 years. In 1963, he joined the Bowdoin College faculty as associate professor of philosophy. In 1967, he was promoted to full professor. He served as chairman of Bowdoin's department of philosophy several times. On June 30, 1993, he became professor emeritus. Personal life and death McGee married Rose Adamek in 1950, and they had one daughter and one son. They divorced in 1972 and he later married Phoebe Hurley. In 1953, while a doctoral candidate at Harvard University, McGee wrote a letter to Life magazine in response to the essay \\"Is Academic Freedom in Danger?\\" by Whittaker Chambers, stating: > Sirs: > When a mob is in action, the number of its leaders is less important than > the nature and consequence of their influence. The extent of the influence > of those now alleged to be threatening academic freedom is not to be > measured by the number of investigating congressmen, nor even in the comic > or unpleasant posturings of local vigilante groups, but in the confused and > suspicious attitude of the American public. A citizenry led to mistrust > academic freedom by some political leaders and some of its press is only too > likely to rise in righteous panic and crush those freedoms. If academic > people seem over sensitive, it is because they occupy exposed positions, and > in a general attack are not only the first to falI but may fall long before > their fellow citizens discover an assault is under way. Though Mr. Chambers > would have us believe alarms from academic outposts are false, his > \\"argument\\" fails to support that conclusion. > C. Douglas McGee > Cambridge, MA For many years McGee attended the International Wittgenstein Symposium in Kirchberg am Wechsel, Neunkirchen district, Lower Austria, Austria. He retired there in 1993 and died there age 67 on December 22, 1993, from a heart attack. Works In his book The Recovery of Meaning, McGee addressed a crisis in the fields of ethics and theory of knowledge. In a passage typical of his humanist ethics, he wrote: > If personal morality had a compelling rational basis, the moralist could > rest his case on rational demonstration and deduce the certain canons of > moral rationality. In fact no ultimately rational ground is available, and > to insist on its necessity is one road to moral disaster. Not rationality > but reasonableness is what we can reasonably hope.

He began playing high school basketball for St. Anthony Catholic High School, where he became embroiled in eligibility issues in his second season. He transferred to Aspire Basketball Academy as a junior and was a consensus five-star recruit entering college. Early life Bassey was born in Lagos, Nigeria, where he played soccer until age 12, standing at the time. At that age, he was discovered by a youth basketball coach while Bassey was selling fried chicken on the side of a road and wearing flip-flops that were too small for him. He stopped playing soccer soon after, instead focusing on developing his basketball skills. At age 14, Bassey was named most valuable player (MVP) of basketball camp Giants of Africa, a program established by Toronto Raptors executive Masai Ujiri. High school career At age 14, at a height of , Bassey moved to the United States to continue his basketball career at St. Anthony Catholic High School, a private school in San Antonio, Texas. Before the season began, in November 2015, recruiting expert Frank Burlison considered him one of, if not the best prospect in his class. Commentator Fran Fraschilla said, \\"I don't think I've ever seen a freshman as talented as this kid,\\" while scout Clark Francis labeled him the top prospect from San Antonio since Shaquille O'Neal. In his high school debut, against Stony Point High School, Bassey recorded a triple- double of 20 points, 10 rebounds, and 10 blocks. He closed the season averaging 20.2 points, 17.1 rebounds, and 5.9 blocks per game, making the MaxPreps Freshman All-American First-Team. St. Anthony finished with a 32–6 record and a runners-up finish at the Texas Association of Private and Parochial Schools (TAPPS) championship game, despite coming off a 7–15 record in the prior season. In April 2016, Bassey played in the International Game of the Jordan Brand Classic, scoring 14 points and grabbing 12 rebounds en route to winning MVP. Before his sophomore season, Bassey was named to the 2016–17 All-USA preseason boys basketball team by USA Today High School Sports. He was also included among 50 players in the preseason watchlist for the Naismith Trophy. However, before playing any games, Bassey was ruled ineligible by the TAPPS, without explanation from its executive director. St. Anthony soon appealed the ruling, which sidelined Bassey and two other team members, with principal Rene Escobedo calling it \\"unjust.\\" Despite the suspension, Bassey made his season debut on November 29, 2016, scoring nine points off the bench against A. C. Jones High School. His team's head coach Jeff Merritt was subsequently fired for playing an ineligible player. In early December 2016, St. Anthony withdrew from the TAPPS and joined the Texas Christian Athletic League (T-CAL), allowing Bassey to become eligible again. At the Mike Miller Classic against Washington High School in January 2017, he recorded 25 points, 12 rebounds, 6 blocks, and 3 assists. In April, at an Adidas Gauntlet tournament, Bassey averaged a double-double, prompting recruiting service Rivals to compare him to a young Dwight Howard. On July 7, 2017, Hennssy Auriantal, Bassey's legal guardian in the United States and assistant coach at St. Anthony, was dismissed from the school's program. In August, it was announced that Bassey would leave the team as well, with his immigration records being transferred to DeSales High School in Louisville, Kentucky. For his junior season, he began playing for Aspire Basketball Academy in Louisville, while attending school at DeSales. On June 14, 2018, Bassey reclassified to the class of 2018 and announced his commitment to play college basketball at Western Kentucky under head coach Rick Stansbury. When asked about Bassey's recruitment, Stansbury said, \\"Why shouldn't a young man go somewhere where he has a chance to be special and be impactful. That's what we sold him on.\\" College career On November 6, 2018, Bassey debuted for Western Kentucky, recording a double-double of 11 points and 12 rebounds in a 73–55 loss to Washington. During Bassey’s freshman season at Western Kentucky he averaged a double-double with 14.6 points per game and 10 rebounds per game. There was speculation that he might declare for the NBA Draft following his freshman season. However, he decided to return for his sophomore season. He broke his tibia in a win against Arkansas and had to undergo surgery, ending his sophomore season. Through 10 games he was averaging 15.3 points, 9.2 rebounds and 1.6 blocks per game.

At the time, Bassey considered moving back to Nigeria, but his father Akpan Ebong Bassey encouraged him to stay for financial reasons. Canadian-born basketball coach Hennssy Auriantal, who runs the Yes II Success organization that brings international players to American private schools helped bring Bassey to the United States. On March 31, 2017, Auriantal and his wife were granted conservatorship over Bassey. Bassey's father later filed a petition to reopen the case and give Nigerian basketball tournament organizer John Faniran custody over his son, but the petition was dropped due to lack of verification.

He was on a ticket with Joe Markley, who had won a Republican primary for lieutenant governor. Their ticket lost to the ticket of Democratic Party candidate Ned Lamont and running mate Susan Bysiewicz, cross-endorsed by the Working Families Party, on November 7, 2018. Born and raised in North Haven, Connecticut, he is a former business executive of General Electric, 3i Group plc, UBS, and Dollar Financial Group. On August 14, 2018, Stefanowski won the Republican primary in the 2018 Connecticut gubernatorial election. On August 15, 2018, President Donald Trump endorsed Stefanowski's campaign. Stefanowski resides in Madison, Connecticut. Early life Stefanowski's father, Bob Stefanowski, was the scoreboard assistant for the Yale Bowl. Stefanowski graduated from North Haven High School in 1980. He earned a B.S. in accounting from Fairfield University in 1984 and an MBA from Cornell University in 1992. Stefanowski began as an auditor in Hartford, Connecticut for PricewaterhouseCoopers after graduating from Fairfield University. Professional Stefanowski's tenure at General Electric began in 1994 where he held multiple senior roles through 2007. In 2003, Stefanowski became president and CEO of GE Commercial & Industrial Finance and then proceeded in 2004-2005 to serve as president and CEO of GE Telecom, Media & Technology Finance. Stefanowski worked at the GE Capital headquarters in Norwalk, Connecticut. From 2008 to 2011, Stefanowski was chairman and managing partner of 3i Group plc in London, England. He then served as chief financial officer of UBS, where he restructured the Investment Bank to meet Basel III regulatory requirements. From 2014 to 2017 he served as CEO of Dollar Financial Group in London and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Political career On September 16, 2017, Stefanowski announced that he would run for governor for the August 14, 2018 Republican primary. He campaigned on phasing out the state income tax, corporate income tax, reducing business entity taxes, and eliminating the gift tax and the estate tax, in addition to using zero-based budgeting and creating a Taxpayer Bill of Rights. Stefanowski's campaign's first television commercials aired on January 24, 2018, in the Hartford-New Haven and New York markets criticizing Democratic Governor Dannel P. Malloy and promoting Stefanowski's economic plan co- authored with Reagan Economic Policy Advisory Board member Arthur Laffer. Stefanowski further criticized outgoing Governor Dan Malloy for spending over $15 million of taxpayer money on political campaigns and has refused to accept taxpayer money for his campaign. The Wall Street Journal reported that Stefanowski funded his campaign with a combination of fundraising and his own money, but that he had declined to state how much of his own money he would spend. Stefanowski received support for his economic plan from Laffer and Larry Kudlow. Additionally, he received endorsements from former Republican competitor Peter Lumaj, state representative Noreen Kokoruda, state senator Len Suzio, and former U.S. Comptroller General David M. Walker, Middletown Planning and Zoning Commissioner Tyrell Brown, Middletown Board of Education member Edward Ford, Jr., and Shelton Mayor Mark Lauretti. Following his nomination, on August 15, 2018, Trump endorsed the campaign. On April 3, 2018, Stefanowski wrote a letter to state Republican Chairman J.R. Romano that he would petition his way onto the August primary ballot by collecting signatures of 2 percent of registered Republicans statewide, or 9,081 signatures. Stefanowski was present to collect signatures at the state Republican Party convention on May 11–12 at Foxwoods Resort Casino in Mashantucket, Connecticut where the party endorsed Danbury Mayor Mark Boughton, but his name was not placed into formal nomination. On June 5, 2018, prior to the June 12 petitioning deadline, Stefanowski submitted over 12,000 signatures to Connecticut city and town registrars. On June 18, 2018, he became the second individual to petition to get onto the ballot in the state of Connecticut, and the first to do so in a gubernatorial election, following approval of 10,951 signatures from the Secretary of the State’s Office. Republican Peter Schiff was the first to petition onto a primary ballot in Connecticut during the U.S. Senate election in Connecticut in 2010. Stefanowski received an AQ rating from the National Rifle Association Political Victory Fund, or NRA-PVF, on July 30, 2018. The New York Times reported that Stefanowski “promised to fight further restrictions on guns” in Connecticut. Gubernatorial election On August 14, 2018, Stefanowski won the Republican nomination for Governor of Connecticut. He faced Democrat Ned Lamont and petitioning candidate Oz Griebel in the general election on November 6, 2018.

Strathern’s Alberta Newspapers, 1880-1982: An historical directory (Edmonton: University of Alberta Press, 1988), p. 37. The first English- language Jewish newspaper in Canada was Montreal’s Jewish Times, Dec. 10, 1897 (Lewis Levendel, A Century of the Canadian Jewish Press: 1880s-1980s. Ottawa: Borealis Press, 1989, chapter 1). and the earliest attempt to produce a Western Canadian regional Jewish newspaper in English.In 1906 The Echo, a Yiddish-language newspaper “devoted entirely to the interests of the Jewish population of western Canada”, appeared for a short time (Arthur A. Chiel, The Jews in Manitoba. University of Toronto Press, 1961, p. 124). Canada’s first Yiddish weekly, Der Keneder Adler, proclaimed in its first issue that it would “faithfully represent Canadian Jewish interests” (“To the Jews of Canada,” Keneder Adler, August 30, 1907, translated by David Rome, Through the Eyes of The Eagle: The Early Montreal Yiddish Press 1907-1916. [Montreal]: Véhicule Press, 2001, p. 33). Reuben Brainin’s Der Veg, a competing Montreal Yiddish newspaper launched in September 1915, aimed to be a “strictly up-to-date newspaper for the Jews of Canada” (The Fourth Estate, New York, January 23, 1915, p. 25). It lasted two years (Rome, p. 46). Like many other efforts to publish Jewish newspapers in Canada between 1891 and the first decades of the 20th century,Several such attempts are cited in Abraham Rhinewine, “The Jewish Press in Canada,” in Arthur Daniel Hart (ed.), The Jew in Canada (1926; Toronto: Now & Then Books, abridged facsimile edition, 2010), p. 457; “Clearly there was no lack of Winnipeg [Jewish] papers [pre-1914] in the Momma Loshen [Yiddish], but their life expectancies were far from impressive” (Stuart E. Rosenberg, The Jewish Community in Canada. Vol. 2, Toronto: McClelland and Stewart Ltd., 1971, p. 166]. it proved to be ephemeral.Harry Gutkin’s Journey Into Our Heritage (Toronto: Lester & Orpen Dennys, 1980), pp. 179-81 lists four Yiddish-language newspapers in Winnipeg published between 1900-21 which failed to survive for long. Gutkin dates the Guardian, the first English- language newspaper in Winnipeg, to 1920, with it surviving only half-a-year. The major Anglo-Jewish newspapers in Western Canada did not appear until the Jewish Post of 1925 and Western Jewish News of 1927.  Background  Jews first came to the Prairie Provinces of Western Canada in 1877.“Jews in Western Canada to mark centennial of settlements,” JTA Daily News Bulletin, August 25, 1976, p. 4. Although there were only about 3,000 Jews in Winnipeg (Western Canada’s largest city) in 1905 out of a total population of some 80,000 people,Clarence I. de Sola., “Winnipeg,” Jewish Encyclopedia vol. XII (New York: Funk & Wagnalls, 1906), p. 535. Arthur Chiel notes that “the Jews of Manitoba early desired a press of their own”Chiel, The Jews in Manitoba, p. 123. to such an extent that in 1914, the Canadian Israelite (founded in 1910) became the only Yiddish daily newspaper in Canada, when it converted from a weekly.Chiel, The Jews in Manitoba, p. 125. The Canadian Western Jewish Times was operated by Winnipeg-born Jewish brothers Jacob Bell Barron (1888–1965)For information about the Barrons, see “Family Histories,” in Land of Promise: The Jewish Experience in Southern Alberta 1889-1945 (Jewish Historical Society of Southern Alberta, 1996), p. 246. and Abraham Lee Barron (1889–1966).A.L.

Smith, Calgary’s Grand Story: The making of a Prairie Metropolis from the viewpoint of two Heritage buildings (University of Calgary Press, 2005), page 88. Calgary’s population had increased by over 1000% in the previous 10 years, going from 4,398 in 1901 to 43,704 in 1911,Max L.

Smith, Calgary’s Grand Story: The making of a Prairie Metropolis from the viewpoint of two Heritage buildings (University of Calgary Press, 2005), page 112-3.  History  In 1914, Abraham Barron was listed as the Business Manager in Calgary of The Canadian Western Jewish Times, with an office at 6 Thomson Block in Calgary. Henderson’s Calgary City Directory For 1914 (Calgary: Henderson Directories Alberta, Ltd. 1914), pp. 295, 482, 1031. At the time, there were 14 other newspapers and periodicals in the city.Henderson’s Calgary City Directory For 1914 (Calgary: Henderson Directories Alberta, Ltd. 1914), p. 1031. The launch of The Canadian Western Jewish Times as a monthly, published from Winnipeg but with associate editors across Western Canada, was noted in the March 1914 issue of Printer and Publisher, a trade publication.“A new monthly publication for the Jews of Western Canada is soon to be published at Winnipeg. It will be known as the Canadian Western Jewish Times and will have associate editors in Western Canadian cities. A. L. Barron is business manager,” Printer & Publisher vol. XXIII (March 1914), p. 74. The newspaper was previously thought to have been “published briefly in Calgary” (Gutkin, Journey Into Our Heritage, p. 179). The first issue of The Canadian Western Jewish Times, with Jacob Barron as Editor-in-Chief, is dated April 1914 (the equivalent Hebrew date of Nisan 5674 is cited). The cover was designed by Stafford & Kent, with the seal done by P. Waterman, both of Calgary. The claimed staff of 16 came from across Western Canada, with correspondents in British Columbia (Vancouver); Alberta (Calgary, Edmonton, and Lethbridge); Saskatchewan (Moose Jaw and Regina); and Manitoba (Winnipeg).The cover of The Canadian Western Jewish Times for April 1914 is reproduced in The Jewish Star, Calgary Edition, August 22, 1980, p. 7 and Gutkin, Journey Into Our Heritage, p. 179. The first issue included a half-page advertisement for kosher for Passover spirits, providing an early indication of the concern for kashrut in the Calgary area.“’Kosher is Class’ in Calgary,” The Jewish Star, Calgary Edition, Dec. 12, 1980, p. 1.  Publication dates  There is only one known surviving issue (Volume I, Number 1) of The Canadian Western Jewish Times.Bibliographers had identified the newspaper from at least 1970, but had not located a copy of it (Gloria M.

His career began in his teens as one of the tresviri monetalis, the most prestigious of the four boards that comprise the vigintiviri; assignment to this board was usually allocated to patricians or favored individuals.Anthony Birley, The Fasti of Roman Britain (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1981), pp. 4f This was followed by a commission as military tribune in Legio XXX Ulpia Victrix, which was stationed at Colonia Ulpia Traiana, the future Xanten. Upon returning to Rome, Quinctianus quaestor as a candidate of the emperor, a prestigious achievement, and upon completion of this traditional Republican magistracy he was enrolled in the Senate. At the completion of his term, he became a comes Augusti per Siciliam Africam et Mauretaniam, or a companion of the emperor Hadrian during his tour of Sicily, Africa and Mauretania around the year 128. Quinctianus returned once again to Rome, where two more of the traditional Republican magistracies followed: plebeian tribune then praetor peregrini. Géza Alföldy dates his praetorship to approximately 131.Alföldy, Konsulat und Senatorenstand unter der Antoninen (Bonn: Rudolf Habelt Verlag, 1977), p. 350 After he stepped down as praetor, Quinctianus held four appointments from the Emperor. The first was again as comes Augusti, only this time he accompanied the emperor Hadrian on his tour of Illyricum and the eastern provinces; Alföldy dates this to approximately 131 and 132. He was then commissioned legatus or commander of Legio X Gemina then stationed in Judea; Alföldy dates his command of the legion from approximately 133 to 136. The last two offices he was appointed to before his consulate was curator of the Via Appia and prefect of the alimentus, which he likely held from the year 136 to 138.Alföldy, Konsulat und Senatorenstand, p. 294 n. 56 Between his praetorship and consulate, Quinctianus also was admitted to the Roman priesthood of the sodales Augustales.

He negotiated a series of cultural exchanges with the Soviet Union, which indirectly created the setting of the Kitchen Debate between Richard Nixon, the Vice President of the United States, and Nikita Khrushchev, the Premier of the Soviet Union.  Biography  Lacy, the son of politician Sterling Byrd Lacy, was born in Mesa County, Colorado. His ancestral home was in Virginia, where he spent parts of his childhood. Lacy graduated from the University of Colorado. Career at the State Department Trained as an economist, Lacy joined the State Department in 1944 or in 1946, after working at the War Production Board and the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. In 1950, while serving as the chief of Philippines and South Asian affairs, he met with Bishop Ngô Đình Thục and Cardinal Francis Spellman to discuss Catholicism in the State of Vietnam, a policy the State Department would later support, which would later come to fruition in the policies of Thục's brother, Ngô Đình Diệm, as head of South Vietnam. Ambassador to Korea On March 15, 1955, he was nominated as ambassador to Korea, to succeed Ellis O. Briggs; previously, he had served as deputy chief of mission in Manila for several years. Sworn in on March 28, he arrived in Seoul on May 8. By the end of the week, he had presented his credentials to Syngman Rhee. His tenure as ambassador was strained, as tensions were high: riots and unrest occurred against the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, as South Koreans considered the commission to be tainted by Communist influence, and demonstrations rocked the United States Embassy and his residence; the Eighth Army began tightening restrictions on the black market, which Korean men saw as unfairly targeting them; and foreign businessmen, including Americans, charged that they were being unfairly taxed by the South Korean government; all of which contributed to an inability to work with Rhee. Thus besieged on all sides, Lacy soon began his early departure as ambassador to Korea: on October 15, President Eisenhower accepted his resignation due to \\"ill health\\", a contrived excuse. He was succeeded by Walter C. Dowling in mid-1956. (Indeed, after Lacy left, it was noted that U.S. policy at the time seemed specifically tailored to angering Rhee and South Koreans.) Later career After his time as ambassador, Lacy worked as a special assistant to Secretary of State John Foster Dulles. In 1958, while serving as the President's Special Assistant to East-West Exchanges, he negotiated with the Soviet diplomat, G.N. Zaroubin, to begin a series of cultural and scientific exchanges between the two nations: these would lead to, in the words of Glenn T. Seaborg, \\"cooperation in peaceful nuclear applications\\" and \\"exchanges in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy\\". It was also considered to be a \\"major cultural agreement\\" for which Lacy received much credit. By establishing a means of meeting and exhibition, exchanges also lead to the Kitchen Debate between Nikita Khrushchev, then the Premier of the Soviet Union, and Richard Nixon, in 1959.. Before he retired in 1961, he served as deputy commandant of the National War College. Personal life In 1943, he married a British widow, Margaret Innes Franks, whose husband had died at the Battle of Dunkirk. With her, he had a son before their divorce; he later married Kirsten Magelssen, with whom he had a daughter; before marrying a third time, to Elizabeth. William Sterling Byrd Lacy died on December 11, 1978, at the age of 68, survived by his third wife and children.

The house was built in 1886-1887 in the Italianate architectural style, and is named after the architectural historian, Carol Peterson.  History  Prior to the construction of the Peterson House, in the mid-nineteenth century the ground was occupied by a mansion that stretched from Butler Street to the Allegheny River. The mansion was owned by Anna H. Irwin who died around the early 1880s.(Deed Book 12815: 365), Allegheny County. Following her death, her property was subdivided into building lots that fronted 46th Street. The lot which now stands at 172 46th Street was purchased by David Sisk on June 15, 1886. On September 24th, 1886, David, and his wife Elizabeth, received a permit to commission construction for the two-story brick house.“Building Permit Dockets.” City of Pittsburgh. 1886. Records list Sylvanus W. McCluskey as both the building contractor and the architect for the house. The house was occupied by many different owners since that time, until in 2006 it was conveyed to Carol Peterson. Carol Peterson was an architectural historian whose writings and work contributed to Pittsburgh’s historiography, and advanced historic preservation of the city’s resources. Peterson lived at 172 46th Street for nearly 16 years, and this is where she wrote the majority of her works. Peterson passed away in December 2017 after a seven year battle with breast and lung cancer, at the age of 58. Peterson’s works include her Pittsburgh House Histories, which detailed the histories of nearly 2,000 individual houses in the Pittsburgh area.Pittsburgh House Histories. Accessed: https://www.facebook.com/Pittsburgh-House- Histories163356233687884/ She also co-authored Allegheny City: A History of Pittsburgh’s North Side with the late former Pittsburgh Steelers owner Dan Rooney.Allegheny City: A History of Pittsburgh’s North Side. Dan Rooney & Carol Peterson. University of Pittsburgh Press, 2014. She also made numerous other important contributions to recognizing and preserving Pittsburgh’s history, and received many civic, professional, and preservation awards for her works. Her house was nominated in March 2018 to become a City Historic Landmark by Preservation Pittsburgh.  Architecture  The house was designed by architect Sylvanus McCluskey in the Italianate architectural style. The examples of the Italianate style can be seen with the symmetry of the primary façade, the one-over-one double-hung windows, and the stone lintels that are flush with the brick façade. In the interior, the four-panel doors with porcelain knobs, the flared newel posts and spindles, the non-symmetrical door and window trim, and the marble and wood mantels with arched openings all are characteristics of Italianate architecture. This style of architecture was made popular through the published works of architect Andrew Jackson Downing in the mid-1880s.PHMC. Italianate Villa/Italianate Style 1840-1885. Italianate architecture is relatively common throughout Pittsburgh, but the Peterson House maintains a high degree of integrity that is representative of the Lawrenceville row house archetype.

Career Skudder started his career as an animator, director, writer, producer, storyboard artist, and voice actor at the animation studio, Six Point Harness. While he was working on different projects for Six Point Harness, he was co-developing a web-series for Mondo Media with Zack Keller called, Dick Figures.

Ed and Zack then started to make 49 more episodes. Skudder also voiced Red, Raccoon, and Mr. Dingleberry in Dick Figures. Dick Figures was doing so well that they both created a Kickstarter to fund the feature-length film, Dick Figures: The Movie (the first feature-length animated production by Mondo Media and Six Point Harness).

History  Akhsitan I's reign saw raids of Rus' which sailed from Volga and threatening shores of river Kura. They crossed the Caspian Sea on 73 ships and, having dropped anchor near island Ruinas (Sari), went up the Kura to Lemberana. At the same time, the Kipchaks occupied Derbent and, having proceeded to the south, occupied citadel Shabran. During the period Sharvan had established close matrimonial ties with the Christian Kingdom of Georgia, and the Georgian kings had several times supported Sharvan in its struggle against al-Bab (Derbent). Akhsitan called his ally George III of Georgia, which in 1173 or 1174 accompanied the Georgian army on an expedition to Shirvan up to the Caspian shores, where George with the future Byzantine emperor Andronicus recaptured the fortress of Shabaran from the invaders from Dernemt for his cousin, the Shirvanshah Akhsitan I and strengthened the Georgian dominance in the area. Yevgeni Pakhomov and Vladimir Minorsky thought the invasion was initiated by the ruler of Darbent, Bek-Bars b. Muzaffar. According to Minorsky, \\"the initiative of Bek-Bars was independent of Kiev, and he must have used bands of free-lances (Brodnici) who were roaming in the south, as a prototype of the future Cossacks\\". Georgian sources speak of the Khazars, but do not mention Rus' in connection with this event. Peter Golden argued that the Rus' mentioned by Khaqani were Volga pirates who came in 73 ships.

Infection in humans is believed to be widespread, based on a 1972 report detecting Keystone virus antibodies in 19–21 percent of the people tested in the Tampa Bay region. The first laboratory isolation of the virus from a human case occurred in Florida in 2016, and was reported in 2018. Identification took almost two years after the case actually occurred, when blood samples taken from the subject in 2016 were analyzed retrospectively by researchers studying the incidence of Zika virus in the Florida population. The Aedes atlanticus mosquito is a demonstrated vector. The virus transmits transstadially through the different stages of the insect's life: A female mosquito may lay eggs carrying the virus, which hatch into infected larvae, eventually maturing into adults that can infect mammals while injecting their anti-coagulant saliva during a bite.

Early life and education Madison was born in Cleveland, Ohio in 1923 to Robert James Madison (1899–1951) and Nettie Brown Madison (1900–1974). His father trained as an engineer but was unable to find employment in that profession. He had three younger brothers, two of whom, Julian and Bernard, also joined the family architecture firm. He attended East Technical High School in Cleveland, graduating with honors in mathematics and science. In 1940, he entered the School of Architecture at Howard University, but interrupted his studies to serve as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army during World War II. He was a member of the U.S. Army's African-American 92nd Infantry Division and served in Italy, receiving three combat ribbons and the Purple Heart.http://dd214chronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/DD214JanFeb2018.pdf In 1946, he resumed his architecture studies at Case Western University, despite experiencing racial discrimination from the dean of architecture, graduating with a bachelor's degree in architecture in 1948. He was the first African- American to graduate from Case Western's School of Architecture, as well as the first to gain a degree in architecture in Ohio. He entered Harvard University's Graduate School of Design in 1951, studying under Walter Gropius, and received his master's degree in Architecture in 1952.Foundation, Cleveland. \\"Establishing a legacy of giving today and tomorrow\\", 10, November, 2014. Madison briefly taught architectural design and site planning at Howard University as an assistant professor, before being awarded a Fulbright Scholarship to study abroad. He was the first African-American architect to be selected for this scholarship. He studied urban design at the École des Beaux- Arts, Paris, in 1952–53. Architectural career Madison (front middle) with his employees at Madison & Madison in 1972 On July 17, 1954, Madison established the Robert P. Madison International architectural firm in Cleveland, Ohio.Robert P. Madison International This was the first black-owned architectural firm in Midwestern United States. The firm initially struggled financially due to the progressive foundation of the company. In 1957, the firm entered every design competition announced and won Third Prize and Honorable Mention in the Ohio Home Competition. In 1958 the firm's design of the Mount Pleasant Medical Center won best design by the Cleveland Chamber of Commerce. In 1965 the firm was selected to design the U.S. Embassy Office Building in Dakar, Senegal, West Africa. Its design won an award and recognition by the U.S. Department of State Foreign Building Operations. Madison has stated that this achievement was one of his proudest moments. According to Crain's Cleveland Business, Robert P. Madison International is ranked no. 9 among architecture firms in northeast Ohio.http://www.crainscleveland.com/article/99999999/DATA/500010553/architectural- firms He retired in 2016. Designs and buildings During the last 20 years, Robert P. Madison International has been both the lead and associate architects for the design of major projects in the Cleveland area, including the renovation of the Cleveland Public Library and design of its new Louis Stokes wing, the Downtown Hilton Hotel,Downtown Hilton Hotel Horseshoe Casino Cleveland, Cleveland Medical Mart and Huntington Convention Center, Cleveland Museum of Art, Cleveland Museum of Natural History, Quicken Loans Arena (now Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse), Cleveland Browns Stadium (Now FirstEnergy Stadium), Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum, Great Lakes Science Center, GCRTA Waterfront Line, Willard Park Garage, Cleveland Hopkins International Airport Concourses C and D and Cafe, and the North Coast Harbor Master Plan.

Contested over 90 laps on the road course, it was the 22nd race of the 2018 Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series season. Chase Elliott scored his first career win in this race after holding off a hard-charging Martin Truex Jr. who was the defending winner from last year. This (as of now) was the final race for Brian France as the CEO of NASCAR, as he was arrested for DUI hours after the race occurred. Jim France was the CEO starting at Michigan. Report Background Watkins Glen International Watkins Glen International (nicknamed \\"The Glen\\") is an automobile race track located in Watkins Glen, New York at the southern tip of Seneca Lake. It was long known around the world as the home of the Formula One United States Grand Prix, which it hosted for twenty consecutive years (1961–1980), but the site has been home to road racing of nearly every class, including the World Sportscar Championship, Trans-Am, Can-Am, NASCAR Sprint Cup Series, the International Motor Sports Association and the IndyCar Series. Initially, public roads in the village were used for the race course. In 1956 a permanent circuit for the race was built. In 1968 the race was extended to six hours, becoming the 6 Hours of Watkins Glen. The circuit's current layout has more or less been the same since 1971, although a chicane was installed at the uphill Esses in 1975 to slow cars through these corners, where there was a fatality during practice at the 1973 United States Grand Prix. The chicane was removed in 1985, but another chicane called the \\"Inner Loop\\" was installed in 1992 after J.D. McDuffie's fatal accident during the previous year's NASCAR Winston Cup event. The circuit is known as the Mecca of North American road racing and is a very popular venue among fans and drivers. The facility is currently owned by International Speedway Corporation. =Entry list= {  style=\\"font-size:95%\\" - ! ! Driver ! Team !

Through Field Agent's mobile app, “agents,” as the company calls its app-users, search for and complete relatively basic tasks inside stores and other locations. These tasks, which generally pay agents between $2–12 per completion, include in-store display audits, price checks, out-of-stock audits, competitive assessments, mystery shops, and other jobs that commonly include photo requests and survey questions. The Field Agent crowdsourcing platform also powers the firm's retail-specific search engine, Jicco, which supplies businesses on-demand photos and information from inside stores. Launched in 2010, Field Agent's mobile app has been downloaded approximately one million times in the United States alone. Field Agent also maintains operations in several other markets, including Canada, Mexico, Australia, South Africa, and the United Kingdom.  History  Field Agent was conceived in 2009 when founders Rick West, Henry Ho, and Kelly Miller began considering how the smartphone, specifically the iPhone 3, could change the way companies gather location-specific, retail information. West was quoted as saying, “We began to see how the average consumer armed with an iPhone could penetrate certain barricades that had gone up in the retail world.” On April 17, 2010, Field Agent's mobile app launched on the App Store, generating 3,000 downloads in the first 20 minutes.

The drawing depicts a piece of industrial machinery in his hometown of Lancaster, Pennsylvania. The work is currently in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.  Description  A principal member of the Precisionist art movement, Charles Demuth's work was often concerned with structures, machines, and logos.Charles Deumuth; American Modernist. Charles Demuth Museum, Lancaster Pennsylvania. URL: http://www.demuth.org/_files/live/DA- PRESENTATION.pdf This interest is reflected in his 1920 work Machinery, which depicts a piece of industrial equipment in his hometown of Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Demuth dedicated the drawing to his friend, American poet William Carlos Williams.“I Saw the Figure 5 in Gold”: Charles Demuth's Emblematic Portrait of William Carlos Williams URL: https://caa.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00043249.1987.10792360#.Wy2G0KdKiUk The painting itself depicts a cyclone separator set in front of a factory wall. The detail of Machinery exemplifies many aspects of Precisionism; the background and the machine's body are made of hard-edged lines, while the machine's tubing is more fluid, seemingly flexible. Demuth uses the shadows cast by the centrifuge to add depth to the painting and to emphasize the roundness of the machine. In addition, the various shades of gray seen on the metal contrast the red and brown of the background, while also complementing the gray, white, and black of the wall's windowpanes. A singular spot of yellow is used to draw the viewer to the progression of the machine's feeding tubes, which serve a dual purpose; the light metallic tubes tie the drawing together, while at the same time segregating the darker windows from the lighter red of the brick.

It was built from 1889 to 1890. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The building is on an allotment originally owned by early colonist T. A. Matthews. The building was erected in 1889/90 for Dr Sides as a medical centre and residence. The building was named after Mr Towers, a chemist who worked with him. It survived the 1890 flood and a severe fire. Typhoid epidemics broke out after the flood in 1890 leading to the closure of all private wells. In all probability the hastily erected extensions at the rear could have occurred about this time to cope with the epidemics. In 1908 the Council building was burnt down, destroying all records of original buildings and early photographs. Succeeding doctors used the Towers Drug Company Building until 1920. After World War II there was a boom period and a building revival. The main shopping centre swung from Mitchell Street to Oxley Street. In the 1960s-1970s the building was used as a residence and the first floor side verandah closed in for extra bedrooms. It would have been about this time that the rear extensions to form a separate house would have been completed. Extra toilets were also constructed upstairs. Between 1970 and 1975 the first floor was used as a coffee house for teenagers and dancing took place. Some fabric damage was caused to the building during this period prior to a notice being placed on the building by Council preventing further use of the first floor. Subsequent events indicate that the old and the new plumbing carried out was not of good workmanship. In 1976 a hairdresser took the lease to the front shop and extra plumbing was carried out. At the same time leaks in the plumbing were repaired. From 1976 stresses and subsequent major cracking of the building had taken place, probably accentuated by the general drying out and shrinkage of the foundation material, in particular the periphery footings. The Bourke and District Historical Society used the premises from 1976 to 1996 as a museum and craft shop.Branch Managers Report 1985 The building was subject to an interim conservation order which lapsed in 1984. In 1985 the Heritage Council placed a Permanent Conservation order on the building. The building was restored in 1985 with funding/grant from the Heritage Council of NSW. In 2018, the building is being used for serviced apartments, known as the Bourke Apartments, and for commercial office space.  Description  The building consists of a two-storey structure at the front of the block and a single storey extension to the rear. The front section is basically of brick construction, with a lightweight first floor extension in the North West Corner. The rear section is partly brick, with a larger fibro extension to the rear. The brick construction represents several stages of development. The building was constructed originally only to the rear of the present shops, extended to the rear of the two storey section without making any jointing, thence with straight joints an infill section and eventually to the rear, again with straight joints. Both floors are timber, and some internal walls to the first floor also lightweight construction. Footings are concrete.Hughes, Trueman, Ludlow 1981  Heritage listing  Towers Drug Company Building was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The building is significant in the streetscape of Bourke.

It measures . The artist presented it to Leeds Art Gallery in 1895. It is the second of three major paintings by Waterhouse that depicts scenes from the Tennyson poem, \\"The Lady of Shalott\\", between the first - The Lady of Shalott - in 1888 and the third - I Am Half- Sick of Shadows, Said the Lady of Shalott - in 1915. In Tennyson's poem, the Lady is confined to a tower on an island near Camelot, cursed not to leave the tower or look out of its windows. She weaves a tapestry, viewing the outside world only through reflections in a mirror behind her. The painting depicts the pivotal scene in the third part of the poem: the Lady spies \\"bold Sir Launcelot\\" in her mirror: the sight of the handsome knight and the sound of him singing draws her away from her loom to the window, golden yarn still clinging around her knees, bringing down the curse upon her as \\"the mirror crack'd from side to side\\". She leaves the tower to take a boat across the river, but meets her death before she reaches Camelot. The cracked mirror reveals part of the scene, echoing a device used in William Holman Hunt's 1853 painting The Awakening Conscience and also in Hunt's version of The Lady of Shalott (1888-1905). The Victoria and Albert Museum holds Waterhouse's sketchbook with preliminary drawings for his 1888 and 1894 paintings of the Lady of Shalott. A study is held by Falmouth Art Gallery. An oil sketch for the painting was sold after his death in 1917 and disappeared. It was rediscovered in 2003 in Iceland, having been bought in London by a fisherman many years before. It was shown in a photograph of Waterhouse held by the National Portrait Gallery, and differs in some ways from the final painting, in which the lady wears a white dress: the dress is red in the sketch. Waterhouse chose a red dress for his third painting of the Lady of Shalott, I Am Half-Sick of Shadows, Said the Lady of Shalott. The sketch was sold in 2003.

His work was often done in collaboration with his brother Étienne Sergent. Biography Edmond Sergent photograph by Genia Reinberg. (courtesy of Wellcome Trust) Edmond Sergent was born in Philippeville, today Skikda, in Algeria. He studied medicine at the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Algiers. He was an intern in the hospitals of Algiers in 1896. In 1899, he studied microbiology in Paris in the laboratory of Émile Roux of the Pasteur Institute.. Upon returning to Algeria, he was put in charge of a permanent mission in Algiers, where he inaugurated a Pasteur Institute of which he became the director in 1912 and continued in that capacity until 1963. His time was divided between his work in Algiers and his studies of protozoology under the direction of Félix Mesnil and of entomology under the direction of Eugène Louis Bouvier. Because of the Sergent brothers' outstanding reputation for their work on malaria, the French Ministry of War sent both brothers in 1916 to Salonika to take measures against the malaria which afflicted 60,000 men of the Corps expéditionnaire d'Orient stationed in Macedonia. In the second half of his career, Edmond Sergent not only worked on malaria but also did research on many diseases of humans, other mammals, and plants. He retired to Andilly, Val-d'Oise and died there in 1969. Edmond Sergent had a strong personality, sometimes bringing him into conflicts with the people around him. Passionate about his native Algeria, he had a strong family spirit, often working his brother Étienne Sergent on the same scientific projects. Edmond Sergent's artistic talent was expressed in many photographs and drawings that he made in Algeria. Photos and drawings published in Research From 1900 to 1910, he conducted research on malaria in the Algerian marshlands, developing preventive methods of sanitation. However, the widespread practical applications of his methods were delayed by WW I and administrative obstacles. From 1927, in collaboration with his brother Étienne, he applied his methods in a 360 hectare area of the marsh of Ouled Mendil, which was part of the marshes of Boufarik. In addition to his work on malaria, he did important research on role of the body louse for Borrelia recurrentis in relapsing fever (1907–1908) and the role of Phlebotomus in the transmission of cutaneous leishmaniasis (1904–1921). His discoveries also concern veterinary diseases such as: the trypanosome cycle of the dromedary disease called \\"le debab\\" in Algeria (1902); malaria transmission in the pigeon by Lynchia maura, a fly belonging to the family Hippoboscidae (1906–1919); and transmission by ticks of bovine babesiosis. He also did research on yeast and plant diseases such as: the role of Drosophila in the contamination of yeast cultures involved in alcoholic grape fermentation; and the identification of a Fusarium-type fungus as the causal agent of baioudh, a disease of the date palm.

The film is about paint on a wall drying, lasting for 10 hours and 7 minutes. The film was created by Charlie Lyne in order to force the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) to have to watch all 10 hours to give the film an age rating classification, as a protest against censorship and the prohibitive cost to independent filmmakers (usually £1000 per film) which the BBFC classification requirement imposes.  Overview  The BBFC charged a flat £101.50 fee per film, plus a £7.09 per minute fee, to classify a film. Hence the more money committed to the project, the longer the submitted film could be. Charlie Lyne started a Kickstarter page in order to raise money to make the film as long as possible. He had filmed 14 hours of paint drying on a wall in advance, in case he raised enough money to show all the footage. Lyne raised more than £5,936 from 686 backers. The film was released on 26 January 2016 with the runtime of 10 hours and 7 minutes. The BBFC gave the film a U rating.

Spacecraft and Mission AEM-2/SAGE spacecraft. Explorer 60 was developed and built at the Boeing Aerospace consisting of two distinct modules: the spacecraft base module and the instrument module. The base module is a small, hexagonal prism containing power, command, communications, data handling and attitude control subsystems to support the instrument module. The base module includes a PCM (Pulse-Code Modulation) telemetry data system and a communications subsystem that makes use of a conical log spiral S-band antenna and two VHF antennas. The base module is spin-stabilized, with 3-axis stabilization provided by an active reaction wheel and a magnetic torquing system (the attitude determination hardware consists of 5 Adcole 2-axis DSS, 2 Hughes HS scanners, and a TAM). The required attitude determination accuracies are: roll 0.7°, pitch 0.5°, and yaw 2.0° in operational mode.

San Beda has won all but one of its semifinals match-ups with Perpetual since the Final Four era, with Perpetual winning in 2004, but losing in 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2016. Prior to the game, Perpetual's wins, and its playoffs appearance, were in danger of being forfeited as several of its players played in a ligang labas game while serving residency. The league sternly reprimanded the team as it found out that the players represented a school-based team, which is allowed by the league rules.

Shiryaev was also a pioneering animation director who is credited with invention of stop motion animation. Early life Alexander Shiryaev was born into an artistic family; both of his parents performed at the Bolshoi Theatre: his mother Ekaterina Ksenophontovna Shiryaeva was a ballet dancer, member of corps de ballet, and his father Hector (Viktor) Cesarovich Puni was a flautist who studied under Cesare Ciardi.Alexander Shiryaev. St. Petersburg Ballet. From Reminiscences of the Mariinsky Theatre Artist memoirs from the Notes by Film Historian magazine № 67, 2004, pp. 61—101 (in Russian) According to the Soviet ballerina Ninel Yultyeva, he was an illegitimate child, raised under his mother's surname.Adagio of My Memory fragment from the 2006 book of the same name by Ninel Yultieva published in the Vatandash magazine (in Russian) His paternal grandfather Cesare Pugni was a famous Italian composer of ballet music who moved to Russia in 1851 to work for Imperial Theatres. Alexander's cousin Ivan Puni was a well-known Russian avant-garde artist. At the age of nine Alexander entered the Saint Petersburg Imperial Theatrical School where he studied under Marius Petipa, Pavel Gerdt, Platon Karsavin and Lev Ivanov. He graduated in 1885 and in a year became a member of the Mariinsky Theatre troupe. Ballet career Shiryaev quickly rose to fame. During the studies he already managed to learn almost the entire repertoire of Mariinka, thus he easily substituted solo performers, both in classical and character roles. Shiryaev's musical talent and extraordinary visual memory gained him a place of Marius Petipa's assistant and tutor. He easily recollected all movements, reconstructing and finishing ballets after his teacher. He helped to stage The Seasons, Harlequinade, The Trial of Damis, among others. As a ballet master he helped Petipa to bring back such ballets as Coppélia, The Little Humpbacked, The Pharaoh's Daughter, Tsar Kandavl or Le Roi Candaule and Giselle. Around the same time he became deeply interested in character dance. In 1891 Shiryaev, aged 24, opened and headed the first character class under the Theatrical School. He studied and implemented elements of Russian, Hungarian, Spanish and other national dances into his ballets. He was the first performer of the Buffoon part in The Nutcracker (the role was edited out from later productions) which he also staged, gaining praise from Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky himself. He also performed the buffoon dance from Mlada, Russian dance from Dubrovsky, dance of jesters and skomorokhs from The Merchant Kalashnikov and other operas directed by Lev Ivanov. Some of his famous ballet performances include Carabosse in The Sleeping Beauty, Ivanushka in The Little Humpbacked Horse, Quasimodo in La Esmeralda, Harlequin in Harlequinade, Dr. Coppélius in Coppélia and Abderakhman in Raymonda. In 1905 a new director of Imperial Theatres made Shiryaev leave the theatre. After that Shiryaev spent a lot of time touring around Europe. He also opened a training school in London; his students later joined the troupe led by Anna Pavlova. After the October revolution he worked both as a dancer and a pedagogue in the Mariinsky and Alexandrinsky Theatres, restoring forgotten ballets. In 1921 he left the stage and became a teacher at the Leningrad Choreographic Institute where he had worked for the rest of his life. Among his students were such acclaimed artists as Michel Fokine, Fyodor Lopukhov, Pyotr Gusev, Galina Ulanova, Yury Grigorovich, Nina Anisimova. Animation During his 1904—1905 visits to London Shiryav acquired a 17.5 mm film Biokam camera and started filming ballets, as well as making home movies involving his family, comedy and trick films. His suggestion to film primary dancers of the Mariinka for free was rejected by the theatre management.Nina Alovert. Belated Premier. Past Pages Come to Life article from the Russian Bazaar magazine, January, 2005 (in Russian) After that he built an improvised studio at his apartment where he carefully recreated various ballets by staging them using hand-made dolls which he created from either clay or papier-mâché; they were 20—25 centimeters tall, and their body parts were connected by thin wire which provided plasticity. He then filmed them on camera, frame by frame. In the process he also made thousands of sketches, catching every movement, also turning them into a filming reel so that one could watch the entire dance in form of a cartoon. From 1906 to 1909 Shiryav produced a number of pioneering stop motion and traditionally animated films. This happened at least several years before Ladislas Starevich — another influential Russian animator who had been long credited with invention of stop motion animation — produced his first films. Although Shiryav didn't hold much interest in animation as an art form, but rather saw it as an instrument in studying human plastics, using his films for educational purposes.Anna Kisselgoff. Critic's Notebook; Pioneering Russian Films Show Ballet Master's Wit article from New York Times, January 14, 2005Peter Lord. The start of stop-frame article from The Guardian, November 14, 2008 During the Soviet period those films were mostly forgotten, although Fyodor Lopukhov and some other memoirists mentioned his animation experiments in their books.Valeria Nosova (1983). Ballerinas. — Moscow: Molodaya Gvardia, pp. 48—51 Ninel Yultyeva described how Shiryaev produced around 1700 drawings and filmed them just to demonstrate one complex dance to his students. For a Hindu dance from La Bayadère he prepared clay figures and made them repeat every movement on camera; his film was later used during the restoration of Marius Petipa's ballet at the Mariinsky Theatre. In 1995 a Russian documentarist and ballet historian Viktor Bocharov started researching information on Shiryaev's animation experiments. He was soon contacted by Daniil Savelyev, a ballet photographer who personally knew the family. He got hold of the entire archive from the last wife of Alexander Shiryaev's son and kept it safe. Bocharov spent many years trying to get financing from Roskino in order to restore the films and produce a documentary.Larisa Malyukova. Viktor Bocharov: Cinema Is a Great Detective Story interview from Iskusstvo Kino №5, May 2009 (in Russian) In 2003 he finally released the one-hour movie entitled A Belated Premiere which included fragments of different films by Shiryaev. Around 2008 Bocharov finally managed to get fundings from the Pordenone Silent Film Festival in order to restore the negatives. Around the same time he got in contact with Aardman Animations who also became involved in restoration and digitizing process. The films were subsequently shown at various international film festivals.Pordenone diary 2008 – day seven at The Bioscope blog, October 22, 2008The Program \\"The Arceology of Cinema\\": Alexander Shiryaev by the Kinoproba film festival Personal life and memory Alexander Shiryaev was married twice. His first wife was a ballerina Natalia M. Matveeva who also performed at the Mariinsky Theatre.Natalia Matveeva and Alexander Shiryaev during the Spanish dance, Swan Lake, 1985 photo at the official Mariinsky Theatre website Their only daughter who had also trained as a character dancer drowned in 1912, and his wife died of grief shortly after. In 1924 he married a drama actress R. Pomerantseva, but, according to the ballerina Ninel Yultyeva, the marriage was also unhappy; after Ninel's mother and father — a well-known Soviet writer Daut Yulty and a close friend of Shiryaev's — were arrested in 1937 as \\"Bashkir bourgeois nationalists\\", she was raised by Shiryaev who called her his granddaughter. Shiryaev played a small part of choreographer Skripochkin in the 1923 drama film Comedienne directed by Aleksandr Ivanovsky. In 1938 he published a textbook Basics of Character Dance together with Alexander Bocharov and Andrei Lopukhov. It was re-released in 2007.Andrei Lopukhov, Alexander Shiryaev, Alexander Bocharov (2007).

These countries share a border tripoint at Trifinio biosphere reserve, and also aspects of classical cultures, history, society, and politics. The Northern Triangle of Central America is the three Central American countries of Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. The term is used with respect to the countries' economic integration, and their shared challenges, including widespread poverty, violence, and corruption, which have prompted many to become refugees fleeing the three nations.Amelia Cheatham, Backgrounder: Central America's Turbulent Northern Triangle (last updated October 1, 2019). The Northern Triangle is one of the Western Hemisphere's poorest regions; as of 2018, all three countries were in the bottom 20% of Latin American nations by GDP per capita. An estimated 60% of Hondurans and Guatemalans subsist below their national poverty lines in those countries, much higher than other Latin American nations. Collectively, remittances make up nearly 18% of the Northern Triangle's economic output. The group of countries has signed trade agreements with Colombia, the United States, and Mexico. The agreement with Mexico began in 2001, later involved the Mesoamerica Project, and expanded to Costa Rica and Nicaragua in 2011. The Northern Triangle has struggles with chronic violence, attributable to longstanding civil war and political instability in the region and expansive criminal networks, such as the transnational criminal organizations, including 18th Street (M-18) and Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13). Harsh anti-crime policies, enacted by Northern Triangle governments starting in the early 2000s, in most cases failed to reduce crime and may have backfired by dramatically expanding prison populations, a fertile ground for gang recruitment. This region has one of the highest rates of intentional homicide for a country. According to the United Nations, in 2016 there were 27.26 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants in Guatemala, 82.84 in El Salvador, and 56.52 in Honduras. The homicide rate declined somewhat by 2019--with 22 homicide per 100,000 inhabitants in Guatemala, 51 per 100,000 inhabitants in El Salvador, and 40 per 100,000 inhabitants in Honduras--but remained markedly high. The Northern Triangle has also experienced high rates of both immigration and migration. Research conducted by the PEW Research Center found that between the years 2007 and 2015, the number of immigrants from this region into the US has risen by 25% According to surveys and other research conducted in this region, the majority migration and immigration levels can be attributed to the social, economic and environmental plight they face.

The enlistment period was six months with re-enlistment possible. Each scout received a uniform, firearm and drew rations. Scout duties ranged from carrying mail between commands to tracking down traditional enemies perceived as hostile by the Army in far ranging military campaigns. Detailed to secure the horses in located enemy camps, the scouts were often the first to engage in battle. The Arikara took part when the Army protected survey crews in the Yellowstone area in the early 1870s.

In 1868, Osage scouts found Cheyenne chief Black Kettle's camp, leading to the Battle of Washita River. To commanders of the frontier Army, the need for native scouts with special skills not easily found among ordinary soldiers was pressing. On August 1, 1866, the \\"Act to increase and fix the Military Peace Establishment of the United States\\" came into force, and the Army could now legally enlist a certain number of native scouts, but no more than 1,000 nationwide at any time, as long as needed. The enlistment and the life at the garrisons On May, 1868, the first Arikara enlisted at Fort Stevenson, to duplicate the success of the Pawnee scouts already enlisted in Nebraska. All recruits came from the tribal police force of chief White Shield. Initially armed with infantry rifles, they soon received Spencer repeating carbines in addition to other equipment. They were paid 40 cents a day for the use of their own horse. Additional members later enlisted at Fort McKeen down river. Strikes Two, Pretty Crow, Elk Tongue and other Arikara made the tour in three days in bull boats. The Army provided clothing including under-clothes, a flannel shirt, footwear and a plumed hat.Libby, Orin G. (1920): The Arikara Narrative of the Campaign against the Hostile Dakotas, June 1876. Bismarck. Some scouts lived with their immediate family at the scout quarters of the garrison. Arikara like Forked Horn and Black Fox served as cooks for the scout unit. They received pay in the amount of 16 dollars per month disbursed every second month and scouts received an addition 12 dollars per month if they rode their own horse. Service history At Fort McKeen Bull Neck and Paint travelled from Like-a-Fishhook Village to Fort McKeen by bull boat and enlisted there.

However, Arikara second chief Son of the Star still encouraged the men to enlist. Protecting surveying crews Arikara scouts formed part of the forces assigned to protect crews surveying a route from Bismarck, North Dakota to Bozeman, Montana for the Northern Pacific Railway in 1873. The Dakota had attacked crew members and soldiers the year prior,Robertson, Francis B.: We Are Going to Have a Big Sioux War. Colonel David S. Stanley's Yellowstone Expedition, 1872.

Lincoln and London expedition from Fort Abraham Lincoln (formerly Fort McKeen, moved further to the south) to the Black Hills in the Great Sioux Reservation. Because the Black Hills are considered sacred to the Lakota, and were barred from white encroachment by treaty, many foresaw a Lakota attempt to halt the expedition. Accordingly, it was protected by both Infantry and Cavalry. George A. Custer was in command.:Reiger, John F. (Ed.) (1985): The Passing of the Great West. Selected Papers of George Bird Grinnell.

The later U.S. scout Running Wolf gives the names of the killed Arikara as Bear-Turning, Little Crow, Standing Bear, Black Shirt and the former U.S. scout Bear-Going-in-Woods. The expedition set off with a number of young Santee Sioux serving as scouts beside the Arikara, and Bloody Knife along with Lean Bear taking lead roles. Some of the 22 members in the scout group, as recalled by Strikes Two and Bear's Belly, were Enemy Heart, Young Hawk, Goose and Red Horse. The scouts rode ahead of the columns and guarded their flanks, so that they were \\"covering much country\\". One morning the Arikara discovered a small hunting camp of Oglala Lakota in the Black Hills. All the Arikara scouts rode up and struck a single man in the village with their horse whip. Cautiously, a few returning hunters visited the camp of the whites. Upon their return, a mounted Lakota tried to take a Santee scout's firearm, but failed and fled, with he or his horse hit by a shot. Neither the hunter nor the fleeing camp was overtaken by the pursuing Arikara. An old Lakota was held captive for a few days and then released. Accounts of these events differ to some degree. The later Indian enthusiast George Bird Grinnell was invited to join the Black Hills expedtion as a collector of birds and fossils. Grinnell rode together with Luther H. North, brother to the leader of the Pawnee scouts. \\"Lute talked Pawnee fluently, and this was a password to the good graces of all the Rees [Arikara].\\" Once, a scout went a long way round to offer Grinnell and North water, and when in camp, some scouts came to watch Grinnell skinning the bird specimens he had collected, and discuss the day's events. The Great Sioux War, 1876 Arikara Indian Strikes Two enlisted as scout at Fort McKeen in 1872. This photograph was likely taken at Fort Berthold Indian Reservation in August 1912, when he and other Arikara scouts told their story to Orin Grant Libby from the State Historical Society of North Dakota In 1876, the second chief Son of the Star informed a number of Arikara in the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation about an expedition against some Sioux commanded by \\"Long Hair\\" or Custer. The father of Young Hawk, Forked Horn, enlisted immediately and said his son would go as well. Twenty-three additional Arikara enlisted similarly. A few days later, Red Bear joined after being scolded by Son of the Star. During the Little Bighorn campaign, the 38 Arikara engaged there worked to protect base camps, and were dispatched as riders, forming a part of the front battle line. The scouts were the first to parade at the departure from Fort Abraham Lincoln. On the way westward to the Yellowstone, scouts on high hills guarded the camp throughout the night, while those in camp were always near the tent of Custer, who would occasionally visit with them. The scouts served as mail carriers between the camp and the fort, and in addition to letters to the soldiers, Red Bear brought moccasins for the scouts from their wives at the garrison. Skilled hunters like Strikes Two and Goose each earned more than 100 dollars during the expedition by selling specific cuts of game at fixed prices to the soldiers. Slowed by the advance of the accompanying wagon train, the Cavalry separated from it at the confluence of the Yellowstone and the Powder rivers. The infantry, along with scouts such as Tall Bear and Black Porcupine, guarded the wagons. Realizing that a large number of Lakota were somewhere in the Yellowstone area, the field scouts received orders to retreat to this position in case of defeat. On June 21, a scouting party returned to camp with news of a large Lakota trail near the Rosebud River. Now trailing the enemy, the scouts sang their sacred songs, seemingly encouraged by Custer. \\"Custer had a heart like an Indian…\\" declared Red Star, \\"…if we ever left out one thing in our ceremonies he always suggested it to us.\\" Six Crow Indian scouts joined the Cavalry for similar reasons as the Arikara. The area ahead was traditionally Crow territory, and acknowledged as such by the Lakota in the 1851 Treaty of Fort Laramie. Since then, the Lakota had taken over the eastern Crow land, including more recently the Bighorn River areaLubetkin, John M.: The Forgotten Yellowstone Expedition Surveying Expeditions of 1871. W.

A reconstruction of an Sign left by the Dakotas on their trail First sergeant Bobtailed-Bull advanced up the Rosebud on one side of the river with a group of scouts, while Red Bear and Soldier directed another group on the opposite bank. Close behind came the mounted troops. By the end of the day, they came to the place of a recently moved Lakota camp. Signs and drawings left by the Lakota were understood to show Lakota confidence in case of battle. Bull and Red Star, along with other Arikara followed four Crow scouts in an advanced search. Lieutenant Charles Varnum joined as Army leader of the scouts, along with Charley Reynolds. The Crow guided the whole party, being in their own territory.Varnum, Charles A.

Custer consulted the remaining scouts and assigned their role in a planned attack to drive away as many enemy horses as possible. The group again mounted and rode throughout the night. During a quick breakfast Bull and Red Star arrived with news of a located enemy camp. Custer followed Red Star to a nearby hill where the Crow scouts had discovered the Lakota camp in the distance. Custer preferred to wait and station his troops around the camp during the night but the Crow convinced Custer that the Lakota were well aware of the presence of the Army and Custer readied his troops for a quick attack. The 22 Arikara present assembled, and the experienced warriors encouraged the young scouts. They rode ahead, found a lone Lakota tipi and counted coup on it. Here they were overtaken by the mounted troops and reproached by Custer for going against his orders to disperse the enemy horses and render them on foot prior to a Cavalry charge. Dickinson. He was a long time scout at Fort Stevenson. In 1876, he departed Fort Abraham Lincoln together with the rest of the scouts taking part in the Great Sioux War. The best mounted scouts followed the fast moving Cavalry on the way to Little Bighorn River. They, along with Little Sioux, Red Bear and 11 scouts crossed the river south of the Lakota camp along with the troops under Major Reno. Red Star, Boy Chief and Strikes Two escaped with 28 Lakota horses. When skirmishing began, both scouts and soldiers dismounted and formed a line. Bloody Knife joined, wearing a black handkerchief with blue stars given him by Custer, and informed Young Hawk and the other scouts that a number of horses had been taken from the enemy. Some were retaken by the Lakota later. The fight grew more intense. During a general retreat, a number of Arikara and two Crow took shelter in a thick grove on the east side of the river. Here, Goose was shot in the hand, while the Crow scout White Swan was wounded in both the hand and leg. Lakota attempts to drive the scouts out into the open failed, and Custer's attack further north drew the Lakota away. The scouts left the thicket, and flying a white flag, headed for a hill where they could see the flag of the U.S. troops. They managed to reach Major Marcus Reno's forces, pursued by the returning Lakota. Here they received word that Bob-tailed Bull had been killed. Other scouts reached Reno's troops. A number stayed, while some drove around 40 captured horses towards the depot on the Powder River, as ordered in case of defeat. As night fell, four scouts carrying a copy of the same message tried to break through the ring of Lakota surrounding Reno Hill, but were turned back. About noon the next day, the Lakota broke camp. Shortly after, some went down a ridge west of their abandoned location. Assuming them to be soldiers, Young Hawk and his father rode towards them. The two scouts returned to the hilltop and reported the location of the party. An officer told them, \\"Now let us go and look for Custer's body.\\" On the battlefield, a soldier directed the scouts to the dead body of an Arikara in a grove, possibly that of Bloody Knife. The body of Little Brave, who had also been killed was never found. Young Hawk led a pony with the wounded Goose on a travois to the steamboat Far West stationed at the mouth of the Little Bighorn River. The first Arikara scouts reached the Infantry camp at the Powder. When they recounted what had happened, all the soldiers doubted them. Some scouts continued carrying mail during the following days, while other worked to locate the scattering Lakota. In September, General George Crook and his men were in dire need of supplies when they followed the trail of a Lakota camp southward to the Black Hills. Some of the fivePorter, Joseph C.

The Arikara accompanying Crook started on their way to Fort Abraham Lincoln with a message asking for relief, and carried the urgent telegram to its destination in only three days. Later In 1889, the scouts paraded through the city of Bismarck on the 4th of July. They formed the United States Volunteer Indian Scouts in 1912. Despite promises to the contrary, most of them never received a pension. In memory of Custer, the old scouts composed and sang a song on Memorial Day in 1917. Some of the descendants of the scouts still sing the \\"Custer Song\\".

CCE is one of the components of the international space mission AMPTE, which also includes MRI, designed by West Germany, and UKS, provided by the United Kingdom. Characteristics Charge Composition Explorer was instrumented to detect those lithium and barium tracer ions from the IRM released that were transported into the magnetosphere within the CCE orbit. The spacecraft was spin-stabilized at 10 rpm, with its spin axis in the equatorial plane, and offset from the earth-sun line by about 20 degrees. It could adjust attitude with both magnetic torqueing and cold gas thrusters. Instruments The satellite carries 5 scientific instruments that are used to measure the composition of the particles in the magnetosphere throughout their energy spectrum and the changes that affect them with the objective of determining the main processes governing their excitation, their displacement and their disappearance. CCE must also detect the lithium and barium ions released by the MRI satellite and transported in the magnetosphere: * THPCE (Hot Plasma Composition Experiment): mass spectrometer designed to measure ions whose energy is less than 17 keV per electric charge. It includes an instrument to measure electrons with energy between 50 eV and 25 keV by breaking them into 8 energy bands. * MEPA (Medium Energy Particle Analyzer): measures the spectrum and energy of the magnetosphere particles whose energy per nucleon ranges from 10 keV (for oxygen) to 6 MeV. * CHEM (Charge-Energy-Mass Spectrometer): Mass spectrometer measures the mass, the charge and the energy spectrum and the incidence of the main ions whose atomic mass goes from hydrogen to iron and whose energy is between 0.3 keV and 300 keV. * PWE (Plasma Wave Experiment): measures plasma waves on 5 frequencies. * MAG (magnetometer): fluxgate magnetometer mounted at the end of a rod. Result of the mission Starting in 1989, the satellite encounters problems with the control module and the energy collection system and finally breaks down on July 18, 1989.

The slopes of the mountains at the mid-altitudes are covered by Temperate coniferous forest. The ecoregion is in the Palearctic realm, with a cold semi-arid climate. It covers .  Location and description  The ecoregion stretches some 2,500 km from the Kuznetsk Alatau mountains in the west, across the western and eastern Sayan Mountain ranges, to the southeastern shores of Lake Baikal. The ecoregion covers the forested mid- altitudes of the mountains, with a lower bound ranging from 600 to 900 meters about sea level (depending on local conditions), and an upper bound of 1,800 meters. This ecoregion is one of high biodiversity, due to its position on the meeting lines of climate and floral zones, and the many micro-climates created by the mountainous terrain and steep river valleys.  Climate  Because of its altitude and distance from the ocean, the ecoregion has a subarctic climate (Köppen climate classification Dfc). This indicates a continental climate characterized by short, cool summers, and very cold, long winters, with wide differences between day and night temperatures. This region is also heavily influenced by the high barometric pressures over Mongolia. The Altai mountains on the west of the ecoregion capture humidity in the winds from the west; precipitation is accordingly higher on the western side of the ecoregion than the drier east.  Flora and fauna  The mid-altitude forest belt can be divided into three sub-zones. The highest is the 'Light Needle-Leaf Sparse Taiga' zone (1,400 meters to 1,800 meters), an open canopy forest of Larix sibirica (Sibirian larch), with notable shrub and grass layers. The 'Dark Needle-Leaf Taiga' zone (900 meters - 1,400 meters) if dominated by Abies sibirica (Siberian fir) and stands of Pinus sibirica (Siberian pine) and Picea obovata (Siberian spruce). The 'dark taiga' zone (600 meters to 900 meters) has the same trees as the middle sub-zone, but more vertically developed shrub and grass layers, and richer soil. Over 800 species of flora are recorded in the ecoregion.  Protections  Officially protected areas in the region include: * Altai Nature Reserve (\\"Altaisky\\"). An IUCN class Ia \\"strict ecological reserve\\" (a Zapovednik) located in the north and east of Altai Republic. (Area: 8,812 km2). * Baikal Nature Reserve (\\"Baikalsky\\"). An IUCN class Ia \\"strict ecological reserve\\" (a Zapovednik) located on the southeast shore of Lake Baikal and the neighboring central part of the Khamar-Daban Range, in southern Buryatia. (Area: 1,657 km2). * Khakassia Nature Reserve (\\"Khakassky\\"). An IUCN class Ia \\"strict ecological reserve\\" (a Zapovednik) covering two large mountain areas (alpine and mountain-steppe), and a cluster of seven steppe sites located within the left bank of the Minusinsk Hollow. (Area: 2,675 km2). * Kuznetsk Alatau Nature Reserve. An IUCN class Ia \\"strict ecological reserve\\" (a Zapovednik) located on the Kuznetsky Alatau, a mountain ridge in the Altai-Sayan mountain region in southwestern Siberia, in the watershed of the Tom River and the Chuly River.

History The first concert hall A concert hall was among the attractions when Tivoli Gardens first opened its doors in 1843. It was a rectangular, wooden building designed by Harald Conrad Stilling. Hans Christian Lumbye was music director and chief conductor from 1843 until 1872. He wrote almost 700 compositions for the orchestra, especially polkas, valses and galops. The Glass Hall Building from 1863 The concert hall was expanded by Johan Andreas Stillmann in 1863. The building was once again adapted in 1885. The building became known as Teatersalen after a new Tivoli Concert Hall was inaugurated in 1902. The Glass Hall was subject to schalburgtage in 1944 and subsequently rebuilt by Poul Henningsen in 1946. Stig Lommer was artistic director of annual summer revues from 1949. The opening show was called Festfyrværkeri med Hornbækrevyen. Lommer left the Glass Hall in the late 1950s. Osvald Helmuth and Max Hansen were prominent acts in the period until 1973. Otto Lington was band leader in 1951-52 and again from 1958 to 1973. Aage Stentoft was director of the Tivoli Theatre from 1973. The casts of his summer revues included actors such as Ulf Pilgaard, Per Pallesen, Marguerite Viby and Dirch Passer. Passer had a stroke during a performance in the Glass Hall on 3 September 1980 and died in the ambulance. Stentoft retired shortly thereafter. Klaus Pagh then served as artistic director of the Tivoli Revue from 1981 to 1987. The building was refurbished in 1998. The Tivoli Revue was revived in 2003 in a partnership with the Dr. Dante Theatre. In 2004, it changed its name to Tivoli Varieté with Søren Østergård as artistic director.

The Catholic Church teaches that while being gay is not a sin in and of itself, any sex outside of marriage, including between same-sex partners, is sinful, and therefore being gay makes one inclined towards this particular sin. A number of Roman Catholics and Catholic groups have sought to change Church teaching to allow for sexual acts between members of the same gender, the acceptance of same-sex relationships, and for gay marriage. Some of these advocate for gay Catholics and other LGBT people. Some also provide ministry to gay Catholics, while others have led protests against Church teaching. Protests have included vandalizing churches and disrupting masses. In several cases they have faced censure or discipline from the Church authorities. Some in the Catholic laity also believe homosexual activity is morally acceptable and that gay relationships should be recognized. Objections to Church teaching There are two main camps of theologians who dissent from the Church's teaching. The first accepts the church's claims that heterosexuality is the norm and moral ideal, but believes that departure from that ideal may be acceptable and that it need not be enforced with public policy. The second questions or rejects the claim that heterosexuality is more natural or moral than heterosexuality. They argue that it is \\"natural\\" for a gay person to desire sex with someone of the same gender and so those relationships should be celebrated as heterosexual ones are. Some who disagree with the Church's condemnation of sexual acts between members of the same sex make the general argument that it emphasizes the physical dimension of the act at the expense of higher moral, personal, and spiritual goals. Some gay and lesbian Catholics and their supporters also feel that the practice of total, life-long sexual denial risks personal isolation. Movements DignityUSA DignityUSA was founded in the United States in 1969 as the first group for gay and lesbian Catholics shortly after the Stonewall riots. It developed from the ministry of Father Patrick Xavier Nidorf, an Augustinian priest. It set out the belief that gay Catholics can \\"express our sexuality physically, in a unitive manner that is loving, life-giving, and life- affirming.\\" It also seeks to \\"work for the development of sexual theology leading to the reform of [the Church's] teachings and practices regarding human sexuality, and for the acceptance of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender peoples as full and equal members of the one Christ.\\" In 1980, the Association of Priests in the Archdiocese of Chicago honored the Chicago branch of Dignity as the organization of the year. Meetings were initially held in San Diego and Los Angeles, before the organization ultimately became headquartered in Boston. It later spread to Canada. With the publication in 1987 of \\"On the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons,\\" which instructed bishops not to provide facilities for organizations that did not uphold official Catholic teaching on homosexuality, Catholic bishops in Atlanta, Buffalo, Brooklyn, Pensacola and Vancouver immediately excluded Dignity chapters, and \\"within a few months the organization was unwelcome on church property anywhere.\\" Call to Action Following a conference in Detroit in 1976 a group called Call to Action (CTA) was established to advocate a variety of changes in the Catholic Church, including in the Church's teaching on sexual matters such as homosexuality. It drew its mission from the US Bishops' 1976 Call To Action conference, in response to the Second Vatican Council, and in particular to its challenge to lay Catholics who had tended to defer initiatives entirely to the clergy.'Mission', Call to Action website http://cta-usa.org/history/ In 1996, the bishop of Lincoln, Fabian Bruskewitz, subsequently excommunicated all members of the group within his diocese. An appeal by the Nebraska Chapter was rejected by the Congregation for Bishops in 2006. Nevertheless, the organization has continued with a wide range of activities including annual conferences and regional groups, and in 2013 it attempted to broaden its appeal under the tagline \\"Inspire Catholics, Transform Church.\\" New Ways Ministry Two of the best-known advocates for a more accepting position on homosexuality within the Catholic fold have been the Salvatorian priest Robert Nugent and the School Sister of Notre Dame nun Jeannine Gramick, who established New Ways Ministry in 1977 in the United States of America. This was in response to Bishop Francis Mugavero of Brooklyn who had invited them to reach out in \\"new ways\\" to lesbian and gay Catholics. As early as February 1976, Mugavero issued a pastoral letter entitled \\"Sexuality: God's Gift,\\" defending the legitimate rights of all people, including those who were gay and lesbian. He said that they had been \\"subject to misunderstanding and at times unjust discrimination.\\" In addition to gay and lesbian Catholics, the letter also spoke to the widowed, adolescents, the divorced, and those having sexual relations outside of marriage, stating: \\"we pledge our willingness to help you ... to try to find new ways to communicate the truth of Christ because we believe it will make you free.\\" These sentiments inspired the pastoral efforts by the co-founders to build bridges between differing constituencies in Catholicism. In 1981, New Ways Ministry held its first national symposium on homosexuality and the Catholic Church, but Archbishop James Hickey of Washington, D.C., wrote to Catholic bishops and communities, asking them not to support the event. Despite this, more than fifty Catholic groups endorsed the program. Both Nugent and Grammick were later formally disciplined in 1999 when the Vatican imposed lifetime bans on any pastoral work involving gay people, declaring that the positions they advanced \\"do not faithfully convey the clear and constant teaching of the Catholic Church\\" and \\"have caused confusion among the Catholic people.\\" The move made Nugent and Gramick \\"folk heroes in liberal circles,\\" where official teaching was seen as outdated and lacking compassion. Similarly, the American bishops Thomas Gumbleton of Detroit and Matthew Clark of Rochester, New York, were criticized for their association with New Ways Ministry, and their distortion of the theological concept of the \\"Primacy of Conscience\\" as an alternative to the actual teaching of the Catholic Church. Rainbow Sash Movement The Rainbow Sash itself is a strip of a rainbow-colored fabric which is worn over the left shoulder and is put on at the beginning of the Liturgy. The members go up to receive Eucharist The Rainbow Sash Movement covers two separate organizations created by and advanced by practicing LGBT Catholics who believe they should be able to receive Holy Communion. The sash was first worn at a Mass in London, although the movement moved its focus to Melbourne, Australia, in 1998. It has been most active in the United States, England, and Australia. Part of the movement split to form the Rainbow Sash Alliance USA, based in Minneapolis in 2004. The Rainbow Sash itself is a strip of a rainbow colored fabric which is worn over the left shoulder and is put on at the beginning of the Liturgy. The members go up to receive Communion.\\"Rainbow Sash Movement at London's Westminister Cathedral\\" If denied, they go back to pews and remain standing, but if the Eucharist is received then they go back to the pew and kneel in the traditional way. Supporters of the sash were keen to use it as a \\"symbol of pride, dignity, and challenge\\", but sought to reassure clergy that their actions would be \\"prayerful, reverent, and peaceful in word and action\\". In 1998 members of the movement attended Mass at the cathedral in Melbourne, where Cardinal Pell refused them all Communion before publicly rebuking their actions to the applause of other parishioners. Members of the movement also took action during Mass in Chicago in 2001 where they were likewise refused. However, members did receive Communion from officiating priests in Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, Rochester, NY, New York City, New Orleans, St. Cloud, Minnesota, and St. Paul in 2003. In 2005, Archbishop Harry Joseph Flynn, bishop of the Archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis, said that the decision to take Communion lay with individual Catholics as to their state of grace and freedom from mortal sin, but that receiving Communion should not be used as a protest. Commenting on why he refused to administer communion, Cardinal Francis Arinze, said that members of the Rainbow Sash Movement disqualified themselves from Communion by displaying their opposition to the Church's teaching. Chicago Cardinal Francis George has said that \\"no one wants to refuse to give Communion; it's a painful thing to do. The policy, however, is about the worship of God, which is not to be instrumentalized or manipulated by any group.\\" Arguing that because the \\"basic criterion for receiving Communion is unity in faith and in moral discipline,\\" the bishops of the United States have a policy \\"to refuse Communion to anyone who used its reception as an occasion to protest.\\" The movement in Illinois also planned to hold in a cathedral prayer for legalization of same-sex marriage in 2013, an initiative that Bishop Paprocki of Springfield called blasphemous. Catholics United Catholics United was formed in 2005 in the United States as a non-profit, non- partisan political organization aimed at \\"changing the narrative\\" concerning the engagement of religious belief in public politics by pushing for progressive policies. It has no official status within the Catholic Church, but has had a significant effect on the religious and political debate in the U.S. In March 2010, former director Chris Korzen appeared on CNN to challenge the Archdiocese of Washington, DC's protest of a law requiring employers to grant benefits to same-sex partners. In May 2010, Catholics United criticized a Boston-area Catholic school's decision to deny admission to the child of a lesbian couple. It has also criticized the Catholic Church for its opposition to same-sex marriage, and for breaking ties to the Boy Scouts of America when the latter changed its policy to reach out to gay members. Other gay- positive Catholic groups There are other groups operating around the world. Some organize prayer meetings and retreats and make common cause in their desire to maintain their Catholic faith without hiding their sexuality. Some have called for official recognition of permanent partnerships as an effective way to curb homosexual promiscuity. In Germany there is \\"Homosexuelle und Kirche\\" (HuK); in France, \\"David et Jonathan\\" (with 25 local branches); in Spain, \\"Coorinadora Gai-Lesbiana\\"; in Italy there are a number of groups based in different parts of the country—\\"Davide e Gionata\\" (Turin), \\"Il Guado\\" (Milan), \\"La Parola\\" (Vicenza), \\"L'Incontro\\" (Padua), \\"Chiara e Francesco\\" (Udine), \\"L'Archipelago\\" (Reggio Emilia), \\"Il Gruppo\\" (Florence), \\"Nuova Proposta\\" (Rome), and \\"Fratelli dell' Elpis\\" (Catanaia); in the Netherlands, \\"Stichting Dignity Nederland\\"; in Mexico, \\"Ottra Ovejas\\"; and in South Africa, \\"Pilgrims.\\" Clergy In a letter of 25 July 1986, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith rebuked moral theologian Charles Curran for his published work and informed the Catholic University of America in Washington that he would \\"no longer be considered suitable nor eligible to exercise the function of a professor of Catholic theology.\\" Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, the Prefect of the Congregation, expressed the hope that \\"this regrettable, but necessary, outcome to the Congregation's study might move you to reconsider your dissenting positions and to accept in its fullness the teaching of the Catholic Church.\\" Curran had been critical of a number of the Catholic Church's teachings, including his contention that homosexual acts in the context of a committed relationship were good for homosexual people. This event \\"widened the gulf\\" between the Catholic episcopacy and academia in the United States. Also in 1986, Archbishop Raymond Hunthausen of Seattle was required to transfer authority concerning ministry to homosexuals to his auxiliary bishop. Hunthausen had earlier been investigated by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith for allowing Dignity, the association for gay Catholics, to hold Mass in Seattle cathedral on the grounds that \\"They're Catholics too. They need a place to pray.\\" As a result, according to John L. Allen, \\"bishops had been put on notice that pastoral ministry to homosexuals, unless it is based on clear condemnation of homosexual conduct, invites serious trouble with Rome.\\" James Alison, an English priest and formerly a member of the Dominican Order, has also argued that the teaching of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith On the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons regarding gay people is incompatible with the Gospel, and states that \\"it cannot in fact be the teaching of the Church.\\" In A Question of Truth, the Dominican priest Gareth Moore states that \\"there are no good arguments, from either Scripture or natural law, against what have come to be known as homosexual relationships. The arguments put forward to show that such relationships are immoral are bad.\\" Father John J. McNeill has written that since gay people experience their sexual orientation as innately created, to believe that it is therefore a tendency towards evil would require believing in a sadistic God; and that it is preferable to believe that this element of Church teaching is mistaken in arguing that God would behave in such a way. LGBT-friendly publications 1970s In 1976, John J. McNeill, an American Jesuit and co-founder of Dignity, published The Church and the Homosexual, which challenged the Church's prohibition of same-sex activity. It received significant media attention, and argued for a change in Church teaching and that homosexual relationships should be judged by the same standard as heterosexual ones. The work had received permission from McNeill's Jesuit superiors prior to printing but, in 1977, the permission was retracted at the order of the Vatican, and McNeill was ordered by Cardinals Joseph Ratzinger and Franjo Šeper not to write or speak publicly about homosexuality. In a statement, McNeill responded that this approach risked exacerbating the AIDS crisis, as \\"gay men most likely to act out their sexual needs in an unsafe, compulsive way, and therefore expose themselves to the HIV virus, are precisely those who have internalised the self-hatred that their religions impose on them.\\" In 1986, the Society of Jesus expelled him for \\"pertinacious disobedience\\" from the Order, as punishment for openly ministering to gay and lesbian Catholics. McNeill remained a priest until his death but was not permitted to say Mass thereafter. In 1977, a collective theological study on human sexuality was published, after being commissioned in 1972 by the Catholic Theological Society of America. The Society, however, did not approve the study after members of its board of directors criticized its scholarship, reflecting tensions between conservative and revisionist theologians about how the Church should approach the issue. Reaction to the publication of the report demonstrated that division and dissent from the Church's teaching on sexuality was common among United States theologians, even within the Catholic Theological Society of America itself. The British academic, John Cornwell, writing about the episode in 2001 explained that the theology contained within the report was contentious because it extended the Vatican II focus on the procreative and unitive purposes of marital sexuality, to additionally emphasise the creative and integrative aspects. He went on to criticize the \\"oversimplification of the natural law theory of St. Thomas,\\" and argued that the Church should recognize that \\"homosexuals enjoy the same rights and incur the same obligations as the heterosexual majority.\\" 1980s In 1983, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith attempted unsuccessfully to block publication of Father Robert Nugent's book, A Challenge to Love: Gay and Lesbian Catholics in the Church, although Cardinal Ratzinger did succeed in forcing Bishop Walter Sullivan of Richmond to at least remove his name from it, where previously the latter had lent his support. Nugent had established the gay-positive New Ways Ministry in 1977 with Sister Jeannine Gramick to reach out to gay and lesbian Catholics, but was stopped from administering the sacraments in 1983 after complaints from conservative clerics. In 1984, Cardinal Ratzinger asked Archbishop Gerety of Newark to withdraw his imprimatur from Sexual Morality by Philip S. Keane, and the Paulist Press ceased its publication. Keane had stated that homosexuality should not be considered absolutely immoral but only \\"if the act was placed without proportionate reason.\\" The Catholic tradition had suffered \\"historical distortions,\\" Keane argued, and should be \\"ever open to better expressions.\\" In 1986, Cardinal Ratzinger wrote to Bishop Matthew Clark of Rochester, instructing him to remove his imprimatur from a book aimed at parents talking to children, Parents Talk Love: A Catholic Handbook on Sexuality written by Father Matthew Kawiak and Susan Sullivan, and which included information on homosexuality. Support for gay marriage In 2003, fewer than 35% of American Catholics supported same-sex marriage. However, a report by the Public Religion Research Institute on the situation in 2013 found that during that decade support for same-sex marriage has risen 22 percentage points among Catholics to 57%: 58% among white Catholics, 56% among Hispanic, with white Catholics more likely to offer \\"strong\\" support. Among Catholics who were regular churchgoers, 50% supported, 45% opposed. A spokesperson for DignityUSA suggested that Catholic support for gay marriage was due to the religion's tradition of social justice, the importance of the family, and better education. In 2013 in England and Wales, 27 prominent Catholics (mainly theologians and clergy) issued a public letter supporting the government's move to introduce same-sex civil marriage. In January 2018 German bishop Franz-Josef Bode of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Osnabrück said in an interview with German journalists that blessing of same-sex unions in Roman Catholic churches in Germany is possible,NDR.de: Bischof für Segnung von homosexuellen Paaren (German), 10 January 2018 as did German Cardinal Reinhard Marx in February 2018. In 2006, Father Bernard Lynch became the first Catholic priest to undertake a civil partnership in the Republic of Ireland. He had previously had his relationship blessed in a ceremony in 1998 by an American Cistercian monk. He was subsequently expelled from his religious order in 2011 and legally wed his husband in 2016. In 2012, a group of sixty-three former Catholic priests in the USA publicly announced their support for Referendum 74, which would make Washington the nation's seventh state to legalize marriage between same-sex couples. In a statement, they said: \\"We are uneasy with the aggressive efforts of Catholic bishops to oppose R-74 and want to support the 71 percent of Catholics (Public Religion Research Institute) who support civil marriage for gays as a valid Catholic position.\\" In October 2014, Wendelin Bucheli, a priest in Bürglen in the west of Switzerland, was removed from his diocese by the local bishop after performing a blessing for a lesbian couple. He said he had discussed it with other members of the clergy before making the decision to acknowledge the relationship. In several cases, clergy or laypeople have been fired from jobs at Catholic schools or universities because of their support for LGBT rights campaigns, or their marriages to partners of the same sex. In one case, a Jesuit high school refused to fire a teacher after he entered into a gay marriage. As result, the local bishop designated the school as no longer Catholic. In the United States, more than 50 people have reported losing their jobs at Catholic institutions since 2010 over their sexual orientation or identity, according to New Ways Ministries. Lay opinion United States The United States has the fourth largest Catholic population in the world. Research conducted by the Public Religion Research Institute has indicated that Catholics who leave the Church are more likely than those who leave other religions to say the reason was concern about \\"negative religious treatment of gay and lesbian people\\". A 2011 report by the same organisation found that 73% of American Catholics favoured anti-discrimination laws, 63% supported the right of gay people to serve openly in the military, and 60% favoured allowing same-sex couples to adopt children. The report also found Catholics to be more critical than other religious groups about how their church is handling the issue. In June 2015, data from Pew Research suggested that 66% of American Catholics think it is acceptable for children to be brought up by with gay parents. More generally, 70% thought it acceptable for a gay couple to cohabit. Less than half believed that homosexuality should be regarded as a sin (44% of Catholics compared to 62% of Protestants); and a majority would like the Church to be more flexible toward those who are in same-sex relationships, including the right to have marriages recognised. In August 2015, a poll jointly commissioned by the Public Religion Research Institute and the Religion News Service was released suggesting that on issues such as LGBT rights there is \\"a widening ideological gulf between Catholic leadership and people in the pews,\\" as well as a more progressive attitude among Catholics compared to the US population more generally: 60% of Catholics favor allowing gay and lesbian couples to marry legally, compared to 55% of Americans as a whole. Most Catholics (53%) said they did not believe same-sex marriage violated their religious beliefs; 76% of Catholics also said that they favored laws that would protect LGBT people from discrimination (alongside 70% of Americans overall). Finally, around 65% of Catholics oppose policies which permit business owners the right to refuse service to customers who are LGBT by citing religious concerns (compared to 57% of Americans). Elsewhere A 2014 poll commissioned by the US Spanish-language network Univision of more than 2,000 Catholics in 12 countries (Uganda, Spain, the US, Brazil, Argentina, France, Mexico, Italy, Colombia, Poland, the Philippines, and the DRC) found that two thirds of respondents were opposed to the idea of civil same-sex marriage, and around one third was in favor. However, the level of resistance varied between economically developing and developed countries, with 99% of respondents opposed in Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo; but a majority in favor in Spain (63%) and the US (54%). Additionally, in all countries a majority of those polled said they did not think the Catholic Church should perform marriages between two people of the same sex—although the results again ranged with support strongest in Spain (43% in favour) to Uganda (99% against). In January 2014 the former president of Ireland, Mary McAleese, strongly criticized the Catholic Church's approach to homosexuality in a lecture to the Royal Society of Edinburgh: \\"I don't like my church's attitude to gay people. I don't like 'love the sinner, hate the sin'. If you are the so-called sinner, who likes to be called that?\\" Her comments were welcomed by the Irish Association of Catholic Priests. The German bishops conference reported in February 2014 that in Germany \\"the Church's statements on premarital sexual relations, homosexuality, on those divorced and remarried, and on birth control ... are virtually never accepted, or are expressly rejected in the vast majority of cases\\"; and that there was \\"a 'marked tendency' among Catholics to accept legal recognition of same-sex unions as 'a commandment of justice' and they felt the Church should bless them, although most did not want gay marriage to be legalised.\\" A YouGov poll held in the United Kingdom in 2015 found that Catholics had a more liberal attitude towards gay marriage than Protestants, although both groups are less accepting on the issues than the public as a whole: 50% of Catholics support gay marriage (compared to 45% of Protestants, and 66% of people in the UK as a whole). World Values Survey Using data from the World Values Survey, Austrian political scientist Arno Tausch examined the opinions on homosexuality of respondents who identified as \\"practicing\\" Roman Catholics (attending Mass at least once a week). He found that homosexuality is broadly tolerated much more in developed than in developing countries, with the former Communist countries of Eastern Europe in a middle position. The majority of practicing Roman Catholics in many countries, including New Zealand, Canada, the United States, Australia, and Britain, would accept a gay neighbor. Similarly, a majority in some countries reject the opinion that homosexuality can never be justified. Tausch concluded that in a number of countries, the rejection of homosexuality among practicing Roman Catholics is weaker than the societies in which they live. Protests Over recent decades a number of gay rights activists and supporters have protested inside and outside of Catholic church buildings. In many cases such protestors were Catholic, yet angry at feelings of marginalization. There was concern that the Church's teaching on homosexuality and the use of condoms had contributed to the AIDS crisis. As the number of deaths of gay and bisexual men rose rapidly during the 1980s, a sense of \\"urgency\\" to take action developed; activists argued that this was \\"a necessary step in fighting the war on AIDS and homophobia\\". ACTUP =Stop the Church= The first \\"Stop the Church\\" protest was held on 10 December 1989 by the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP) and Women's Health and Mobilization. The demonstration took place at St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York while O'Connor was celebrating a Mass attended by Mayor Edward I. Koch and other political leaders. ACTUP opposed the public positions of the Church which they felt were hurtful to people with AIDS, and the Church's pro-life views. Some tried to \\"storm\\" the church, but police stopped those who were obvious protesters from entering. The crowd grew to 4,500 gathered outside. Originally, the plan was just to be a \\"die-in\\" during the homily but it descended into \\"pandemonium.\\" A few dozen activists entered the cathedral, interrupted Mass, chanted slogans, blew whistles, \\"kept up a banchee screech,\\" chained themselves to pews, and laid down in the aisles to stage a \\"die-in.\\" One protester, \\"in a gesture large enough for all to see,\\" desecrated the Eucharist by spitting it out of his mouth, crumbling it into pieces, and dropping them to the floor. One-hundred and eleven protesters were arrested, including 43 inside the church. Some, who refused to move, had to be carried out of the church on stretchers. The protests were widely condemned by public and Church officials, members of the public, the mainstream media, and some in the gay community. =1990 Boston ordination= During an ordination of priests in Boston in 1990, ACT UP and the Massachusetts Coalition for Lesbian and Gay Civil Rights chanted and protested outside during the service. The protesters marched, chanted, blew whistles, and sounded airhorns to disrupt the ceremony. They also threw condoms at people as they left the ordination and were forced to stay back behind police and police barricades. One man was arrested. The demonstration was condemned by Leonard P. Zakim, among others. =Saint Vincent's Catholic Medical Center= In the 1980s, as the gay population of Greenwich Village and New York began succumbing to the AIDS virus, St. Vincent's established the first AIDS Ward on the East Coast and second only to one in San Francisco, and soon became \\"Ground Zero\\" for the AIDS-afflicted in NYC. The hospital \\"became synonymous\\" with care for AIDS patients in the 1980s, particularly poor gay men and drug users. It became one of the best hospitals in the state for AIDS care with a large research facility and dozens of doctors and nurses working on it. ACT UP protested the hospital one night in the 1980s due to its Catholic nature. They took over the emergency room and covered crucifixes with condoms. Their intent was both to raise awareness and offend Catholics. Instead of pressing charges, the sisters who ran the hospital decided to meet with the protesters to better understand their concerns. Others in the United States In November 1986, two \\"mobsters\\" from the Lavender Hill Mob, a radical gay activist group, dressed as priests and disrupted a Mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York City being said Cardinal John O'Connor. The disruption came as a protest to the Catholic Church's recent condemnation of homosexuality. They unfurled a banner that said they were gay and would not be silenced. A few weeks later, the group wrote a check for $3,200 so that eight members could attend a charity dinner attended by wealthy New York Catholics, and hosted by the Archbishop of New York. They disrupted the event, unfurled the same banner, and canceled the check before it could be cashed. After On the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons was published, Dignity began staging a series of protests in what they called the Cathedral Project. They would respectfully participate in Mass until the homily began. At this point they would stand up and turn their backs on the priest. They were then escorted out of the church by ushers while police stood by in the back of the church. In 1989, gay activists in Los Angeles acting under the name of \\"Greater Religious Responsibility\\" (GRR) splattered red paint, representing blood, on four churches to protest Archbishop Roger M. Mahony. They also pasted posters of Mahoney calling him a murderer. This was in response to Mahony having chaired a meeting of Catholic bishops to publicly reject the use of condoms as a way to combat the spread of AIDS. Mahony had called 'safe-sex' a \\"myth, which is both a lie and a fraud.\\" One anonymous priest whose rectory was vandalized told the Los Angeles Times that \\"This is a horrible struggle for us priests who are trying to be pastoral.\\" The annual meeting of the bishops of the United States in 2000, including a Mass, was interrupted by a series of protests by gay activists from Soulforce, the Rainbow Sash, and others. The protests came at the end of a year of protests for Soulforce, several of which resulted in arrests, including 104 at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception. Seven protesters tried to receive the Eucharist while wearing a bright rainbow-colored sash to indicate they were gay, but were denied it by the administering priest. In the United States, there is a policy \\"to refuse Communion to anyone who used its reception as an occasion to protest.\\" Outside the US In January 1998, 39-year-old Alfredo Ormando set fire to himself in St Peter's Square, Vatican City, as a political protest against the Catholic Church's condemnation of homosexuality. He died shortly after from his injuries. In Belgium in 2013, four topless women from FEMEN drenched archbishop André-Joseph Léonard with water during a public event to protest the Church's position on homosexuality.

Early life The brother of Graenum Berger, Samuel David Berger was born on December 6, 1911, in an Orthodox Jewish family. At the University of Wisconsin, where he studied economics and philosophy under Selig Perlman, he met his future wife, Margaret Fowler. In 1938 and 1939, he also studied at the London School of Economics, with a particular focus on the British trade union movement. Foreign Service career During World War II, he worked in lend- lease matters, and served in the United States Army, ending the war as a captain. After the war, he proceeded to join the Foreign Service. A career Foreign Service officer, he was posted to London, Tokyo, and New Zealand; during his service as a political advisor in Tokyo, his assessment of the Japanese Communist Party was opposite to that of Vice President Richard Nixon, who reassigned him to New Zealand. Ambassador At the time of his nomination as United States Ambassador to Korea, in April 1961, he was serving in Greece. Confirmed by the Senate on June 12, he arrived in Seoul on June 24, in the immediate aftermath of May 16 coup, noting that the relationship between the United States and the Republic of Korea remained strong; a theme that he echoed when he presented his diplomatic credentials to Yun Posun, referring only to a \\"period of transition\\". Though he would try to prevail upon Park Chung-hee to hold elections, the efforts came to naught. Whilst ambassador, he was promoted to the rank of career minister in July 1962. As ambassador, Berger cultivated a reticent attitude toward the media, as evinced by his moniker, \\"Silent Sam.\\" All the same, he contributed to a rapprochement between Korea and Japan, and laid the groundwork for the future prosperity of Korea. In 1964, he was replaced by Winthrop G. Brown. Later career After his service as ambassador, Berger (like his predecessor as ambassador, William S. B. Lacy) served as a deputy commandant of the National War College, before returning to the State Department as Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs. In February 1968, President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed Berger Deputy Ambassador to South Vietnam, where he arrived on March 24; during his time there, he sometimes stood in for the ambassador, Ellsworth Bunker. In January 1969, he married the widow of Admiral George Pressey in Hong Kong. In 1972, he left South Vietnam, believing the Communists would not win, and returned to the United States, where he worked at the Foreign Service Institute before he retired in 1974. After his death from cancer in 1980, his brother, Graenum Berger, wrote a book about his service.  References   External links  * Samuel David Berger at the United States Department of State website.

The character of Medea lives in Paris with Jason, who leaves her. * In 2009, Medea was shot by director Natalia Kuznetsova. Film was created by the tragedy of Seneca in a new-for-cinema genre of Rhythmodrama, in which the main basis of acting and atmosphere is music written before shooting. * In the 2013 television series Atlantis, Medea is portrayed by Scottish actress Amy Manson. * In the 2015 television series Olympus, Medea is portrayed by actress Sonita Henry. * In 2016, Olivia Sutherland plays Medea in the MacMillan Films staging of Euripides classic. * Between June and August 2016 the Cuban Broadcasting Radio Progreso presented the 60 chapters series The Mark of Medea written by Orelvis Linares and directed by Alfredo Fuentes.

The second one drowns her own four year daughter in a pond because the baby disturbed her plans of living with her lover.  Theatre  * Helen McCrory played Medea in the Royal National Theatre's acclaimed production in 2014.  Video games  * Liquid Entertainment's 2008 video game Rise of the Argonauts portrays Medea as a dark sorceress and a defector from a cult of Hecate-worshiping assassins. * Summoned as Servant Caster in mobile game Fate/Grand Order in two variants: as an adult who experienced Jason's betrayal already and as a young teen in the time of her just meeting Jason called \\"Medea Lily\\". In the stories of Fuyuki, Older Medea is darkened and has become an antagonist, while in the Okeanos storyline, where her younger self lies with Jason in the ship, Argo, she is both the protagonist and the antagonist.

Buda. Rick Loomis of Flying Buffalo Games stated in 1985 that the Nuts & Bolts of PBM (first called Nuts & Bolts of Starweb) was the first PBM magazine not published by a PBM company. He stated that \\"It was a fun magazine, but somewhat ahead of its time, and it had no financial backing.\\" Afterward, the name changed to Nuts & Bolts of Gaming. Cover of a 1984 issue with cover art by Larry Brenza. Evolution The editors of Flagship Magazine stated that the Nuts & Bolts of Gaming was \\"the oldest PBM magazine\\". According to Rick Buda, the initial issues were a fanzine for Starweb and were made of a \\"Xeroxed copied sheet folded in half … that made four, crude pages\\". Buda explains how the publication was named as follows: > I was enamored with The Berserker character [from Starweb], and really > [started] the zine to discuss strategies for playing that part to the hilt. > That is actually the source of the name, twofold in its reference. One – The > robotic image of machinery (Nuts & Bolts), and; Two – Getting down to > particulars within the characters (get down to the nuts and bolts of > something). Buda stated that, after demand increased, he and Rick Loomis increased the size of the publication, changed the publication rate to bi-monthly, and renamed it to the Nuts & Bolts of PBM. Buda incorporated the magazine as Bolt Publications after the load became unmanageable, changing the name once again to Nuts & Bolts of Gaming. In 1984, Bob McLain from Gaming Universal offered to acquire the publication, but Gaming Universal ceased publication before the deal went through, after a run of three issues. As the publication had been preparing for the transition versus the next issue, it then \\"collapsed\\" and published no further issues. Contents The Nuts & Bolts of PBM was a review, tactics, and news magazine about play-by-mail games. Reception W.G. Armintrout reviewed The Nuts & Bolts of PBM in The Space Gamer No. 48. Armintrout commented that \\"This magazine is a disappointment. Nuts & Bolts needs contributors who have something to say and know how to say it. I can't recommend this magazine until it shapes up.\\" References Category:Bimonthly magazines published in the United States Category:Defunct magazines published in the United States Category:Magazines established in 1980 Category:Magazines disestablished in 1984 Category:Play-by-mail magazines ","title":"The Nuts &amp; Bolts of PBM"},{"id":"57745420","text":"The Play-offs of the 2018 Fed Cup Americas Zone Group II were the final stages of the Group II Zonal Competition involving teams from the Americas.

The series was created by Tony Basgallop who also wrote for the series and executive produced it alongside M. Night Shyamalan, Ashwin Rajan, Jason Blumenthal, Todd Black, and Steve Tisch. Production companies involved with the show include Blinding Edge Pictures, Escape Artists, and Dolphin Black Productions. Mike Gioulakis served as the series' cinematographer. On October 3, 2019, it was reported that the series was scheduled to be released on November 28, 2019. Ahead of the series premiere, on November 22, 2019, it was announced that Apple had renewed the series for a second season. Shyamalan stated that he envisions the series to stretch for 60 half-hour episodes, or six seasons. Casting On August 22, 2018, it was announced that Lauren Ambrose and Nell Tiger Free had been cast in leading roles. On November 30, 2018, it was reported that Rupert Grint had joined the main cast. On December 4, 2018, it was announced that Toby Kebbell had been cast in a starring role. Filming Servant was filmed in Philadelphia from November 2018 to March 2019. Exterior scenes took place in Philadelphia's Center City near Spruce and 21st Streets. A set for the interior of the Turner home was built in a former paint factory in Bethel Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania. In March 2020, Apple TV+ shut down production on the series due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In September 2020, production resumed to finish the last four remaining episodes of season 2. Italian chef Marc Vetri served as a food consultant for the cooking scenes. Reception On Rotten Tomatoes, the series holds an approval rating of 84% based on 55 reviews, with an average rating of 7.11/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Though Servant slithering mystery often wanders into dark, crowded corners, its claustrophobic atmosphere and powerful performances build enough tension to keep viewers hooked.\\" On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 66 out of 100 based on reviews from 19 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Lawsuit In January 2020, Francesca Gregorini filed a lawsuit against Servant producers including Tony Basgallop and M. Night Shyamalan, the production companies involved, and Apple TV+, alleging copyright infringement for her 2013 drama film, The Truth About Emanuel. Basgallop and Shyamalan responded that neither had seen her film and that any similarity is coincidence. On May 28, 2020, a federal judge threw out the copyright lawsuit against M. Night Shyamalan and Apple, ruling that the TV show is not similar enough to the film to merit a lawsuit.

While the core concept of the film was to have a house float into the sky with balloons, the filmmakers needed a rationale for why a character would do such a thing. Their solution was to show the entirety of a married couple's relationship from the first day they met to the day the wife died. They envisioned it as a wordless montage that would play like a series of polaroid home movies. Pete Docter always felt that an expository sequence to open the film was important, as if you do not love the characters, \\"then you're not along for the ride.\\" In an early draft of the Ellie-Carl meeting, Carl is trying to capture a bird with a trap and Ellie punches him in the face, yelling about animal rights. This led into a montage sequence of a \\"lifelong sneak-attack punching game, lending the script some heart in a 'non-sappy' way\\", according to the Huffington Post. Co-director Bob Peterson said \\"we thought that was the funniest thing\\", noting that even when Carl visited Ellie's sickbed, she gives him a feeble slap. Nevertheless, the test audiences did not warm to the sequence. Docter explained \\"We showed it, and there was silence. I guess they thought it was too violent or something\\". From that point on, the filmmakers went with a sorrowful version of the sequence. In one cutting room session, one part of the sequence in which Ellie is despondent having learnt she is not able to have children, received many notes from members of the studio, believing the moment may have pushed things too far. As a result, the scene was cut, though later put back into the film. Director Pete Docter explained: \\"You didn’t feel as deeply [without the scene] — not only just [with] that sequence, but through the whole film. Most of the emotional stuff is not just to push on people and make them cry, but it’s for some greater reason to really make you care about the story.\\" The Married Life piece was the first assignment Michael Giacchino had on the film. He explained: \\"We knew that was going to be one of the most difficult scenes in the film, so we tackled that first, and I was just working really hard to make that scene really work because I knew that was going to inform the rest of the story\\". Originally he had written a different piece to be played in that part of the film, but Pete Docter requested a song that would play as if from one's grandmother's music box. In the shower, Giachinno conceived of the new composition. After recording the initial piece, they went back to make touch- ups at various points to match the emotional tone of the visual sequence.  Plot  The scene \\"sketch[es] out Carl's early married life with childhood sweetheart Elie\\". In general definitions, the 'sequence' excludes the earlier parts of the film's prologue in which Carl watches a filmreel about Charles F Muntz and has a dialogue sequence with Ellie. The sequence is \\"only minutes in length and almost completely silent\\". The sequence begins with a flash at their wedding, and then shows how they fix up the house where they met so that it matches Ellie's childhood drawing. We are then shown three snippets of their new life: cloud watching, working at the zoo, and reading together. On one cloud watching session, Carl points to a cloud and says something that makes it look like a baby. They decide to conceive a child and prepare a nursery, but as the music slows, the two learn at the doctor's office that they are unable to have children, leaving them devastated. At their house, Carl brings her childhood scrapbook, which consoles her. They begin to keep a spare change jar to save up for Ellie's dream trip to Paradise Falls. However, several events, included a flat tire and house damage, cause them to break open the jar early. A montage of Ellie tying Carl's ties follows, showing them get ready for each day of work at the zoo. It is followed by them slow-dancing at home, now in their old age, the spare change jar having been shelved and forgotten. As they fix up their house where they'll spend their retirement, Carl looks upon Ellie's art, representing her dream trip, and realizes he has yet to fulfill his promise, which almost stops the music entirely. He goes to a travel agency and uses to funds to buy tickets for Paradise Falls, and takes Ellie cloud watching, bringing the tickets with him to surprise her. However, Ellie struggles to reach Carl and collapses as her husband runs to her side. As instruments drop out of the harmony, Carl brings a dying Ellie a balloon to the hospital as she once brought him one. Ellie pushes her scrapbook to him, and he kisses her on the head. We fade to a funeral in the church where they married. Carl is still holding the balloon. As he climbs up the steps, they become the steps to his home. He sadly disappears into the door and pulls the balloon in after him. As the music ends, we fade to black.  Analysis  The sequence uses \\"visual techniques and musical sound to accomplish all the above functions without relying on dialogue\\". According to the filmmakers, it was intended to come across as a memory. For the paper Creating an emotional impact without dialogue: the case study of Pixar's Up, Michaela Wozny created a mood chart of the sequence. Carl is seen as sympathetic throughout the rest of the film \\"due to [his] helplessness against the often-cruel, vindictive power of fate.\\" The musical themes established during this sequence play throughout the rest of the film, changing in timbre depending on the context, as an emotional anchor to the relationship of Ellie and Carl.  Critical reception and legacy   Visual sequence  The Guardian described the sequence as \\"remarkable\\", \\"brilliant \\", a \\"masterclass in narrative exposition\\", and thought the childlessness reveal would be emotionally affecting to the audience. The Telegraph described it as \\"one of the most extraordinary openings to a film\\", live-action or otherwise, noting that in the context of a larger film it: \\" dares to risk alienating\\" the audience animated films are generally targeted towards, and threatens to topload the drama thereby making the rest of the film a letdown. The Washington Post deemed it \\"touching\\". CinemaBlend described it as a \\" heart-wrenching rollercoaster of emotions \\" and a \\" bonanza of bittersweetness\\". The LA Times writes that it \\"details the highs and lows of two lives with poignancy and depth.\\" The Guardian deemed Ellie's death to be a \\"heart-wrenchingly understated \\" scene. GQ felt the montage had \\" sheer emotional power \\" and in 2018 wrote it still \\"f***s me up\\". Uproxx deemed it \\"beautifully depressing\\" and \\"as good as Pixar gets\\". Rotoscopers felt the sequence \\"shatters the stereotype of animation being strictly for children\\". Sean Wilson of Den of Geek wrote the sequence left him a \\"weeping husk of a man\\".  Music  The Hollywood News felt the Married Life composition enveloped and evolved the scene.  Awards and nominations  Michael Giacchino won the Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Composition for \\"Married Life\\", at the 2010 ceremony.

To make ends meet, Polina founded a family folk music ensemble. Soon, however, she realizes that her children were worthy of a better fate, and she makes a desperate decision to escape the Soviet Union by hijacking the commercial airliner the family was traveling aboard.

Early life and family Lin Hsien-tang's earliest Taiwan-based ancestor was Lin Shi, who traveled the Taiwan Strait in 1746. Lin Hsien-tang was born in 1881 to and his wife. Lin Hsien-tang's mother died when he was young, and he was raised by his grandmother. Lin was tutored at home and became a wealthy landlord based in Taichung. He was born to the , whose ancestral home is the Wufeng Lin Family Mansion and Garden, located in Wufeng District. Lin was a member of the , established in 1902, and offered his house as the headquarters for the group. Lin Hsien-tang became patriarch of the Lin family in 1904, when the son of , , moved to China after his father's death. Lin Tzu-keng later renounced Japanese citizenship and became the first Taiwanese to be granted Republic of China citizenship in 1913. Despite living in Japanese Taiwan, Lin Hsien-tang spoke only Hokkien and did not learn Japanese. He married Yang Shuei-hsin. Later life and activism Lin Hsien-tang was an admirer of Liang Qichao; the two met in Japan in 1907. Liang stressed to Lin that China would be unable to help end Japanese colonialism in Taiwan, and advised against armed rebellion. They met again in Taiwan in 1911. Subsequently, Lin co-founded several sociopolitical initiatives against Japanese rule. The , established by Lin in 1914 with the help of Itagaki Taisuke, espoused assimilation and equality between Japanese and Taiwanese. In 1920 the published its first issue. The publication was funded by Lin Hsien-tang, Lin Hsiung-cheng, Koo Hsien-jung, and . Lin Hsien- tang was a cofounder of the Taiwanese Cultural Association and Taiwanese People's Party. Lin took leadership roles in both organizations. While leading the Taiwanese Cultural Association, Lin headed the Petition Movement for the Establishment of a Taiwanese Parliament to secure Taiwanese representation within the imperial Japanese government. Starting in 1921, Lin submitted annual petitions to the Imperial Diet, asking to convene a Taiwan Provincial Assembly. The initiative, taken over by the League for the Establishment of a Formosan Parliament in 1923, was unsuccessful, and ended in 1934. In 1926, Lin and Chen Hsin founded the Tatung Trust Company. In May 1927, Lin embarked on a year-long trip across the world, spending most of his time in Europe and the United States. His travel writings included frequent social commentary, and appeared in Taiwan Minpao from 1927 to 1931. After he returned to Taiwan, Lin and founded the in 1930, which advocated for local autonomy. Several members of the Taiwanese's People's Party that joined the new alliance were expelled from the party, and Lin withdrew from the party in protest. Lin's work with the alliance resulted in the local elections of 1935. Lin himself was named to the House of Peers. The alliance disbanded in August 1937, after the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War. Near the war's end, Lin and five others from Taiwan went to Shanghai to meet Kuomintang-affiliated officials and Taiwanese expatriates based in the city. While in Shanghai, Lin and his delegation were invited to attend the signing of an instrument of surrender between Yasuji Okamura and He Yingqin. However, the group did not arrive in time for the ceremony. Lin began learning Mandarin, and lent his support to the Kuomintang. Lin met with Chen Yi immediately upon Chen's arrival in Taiwan on 24 October 1945. Lin became a member of the Kuomintang in November of that year, and was later appointed to the Taiwan Provincial Assembly, then known as the Taiwan Representative Council. The provincial legislature forced land reform, despite objections from landowners, several of whom were targeted during the 228 Incident of 1947. Otherwise, the legislative body held little power, and Lin attempted to resign several times, only to be refused. As a result, Lin left Taiwan for Japan on 23 September 1949, on leave for medical treatment. Lin ignored all calls to return to Taiwan, and he died in Tokyo in September 1956. Legacy Lin Hsien-tang’s Travel Writings from around the Globe, based on Lin's writing while overseas from 1927 to 1928, was posthumously published after Lin's secretary finished editing it in Lin's stead.

The film stars Puneeth Rajkumar, Anupama and Rachita Ram in lead roles. P. Ravi Shankar plays the antagonist, Chikkanna and Sadhu Kokila play supporting roles. While B. Saroja Devi makes guest appearance. Its score and soundtrack is composed by D. Imman, whilst the cinematography is by Vaidy S. The film had a record 1,394 shows on the first day in Karnataka.  Plot  Central Minister Ghanshyam Yadav (P. Ravi Shankar) is intercepted by some goons. Gagan Dixit (Puneeth Rajkumar), who is returning from Kolkata, saves Yadav from the brawl that ensues. Gagan later realizes that the fight was a staged act by Yadav in order to gain sympathy votes. Gagan reports to newspaper editor Avinash (Avinash) and publishes this story anonymously. Gagan meets up with his old friend Keshav (Chikkanna), and they decide to rent a haunted house owned by Namadev (Sadhu Kokila). Despite Keshav's objections, Gagan decides to go through with renting the house. Gagan convinces Keshav by saying that since he has a sacred thread on his right wrist, they will be fine. Gagan also unsuccessfully tries to call a phone number of someone he is trying to find. They go to a mobile network's office to obtain the location of the number that Gagan is trying to call. They meet with Sakshi (Rachita Ram), the manager, who refuses to give it. After story about the fake fight is published, Yadav becomes infuriated, and many ads are removed from the newspaper. To rectify this, Avinash sends Gagan to do a special write-up on Yadav by interviewing him in his private jet. Since Gagan had rescued Sakshi from goons in her office, she had agreed to give the location. After a fairly tense interview in the air, the plane lands in Bellary, and Yadav is ambushed as Gagan leaves. Gagan initially believes it to be another fake fight before realizing that blood is being shed, unlike in the last fight. Gagan then saves Yadav from the ambush, putting himself in the good graces of Yadav. Yadav then gives Gagan the name of \\"Appaji\\" and tells him that he is indebted to Gagan. As Gagan visits Sakshi, she refuses to give the location since Namadev has revealed that it was their fake plan to gain location. Gagan revisits Sakshi's office to obtain details of number but hears Sakshi's father has experienced a heart attack. Gagan takes Yadav's help to rescue her father just in time. Due to this, Sakshi changes her opinion about Gagan and agrees to give details about the phone number and starts to fall for him. After various supernatural activities in the house, Keshav quarrels with Namadev. Gagan tries to break up the fight and consequently loses his sacred wrist thread. He starts experiencing supernatural activities in the house later that night. The next day, Gagan finds some spectacles in a drawer, and decides to wear them. After wearing them, his behavior begins to change. Gagan goes to interview Saroja Devi at a country club; while interviewing her, he notices his vision blurring. He wears the spectacles to regain focus, and he completely shifts his focus on the man in the pool. Gagan relentlessly beats up the man and fights off any security who try to hold him back, occasionally asking the man \\"Why did you kill me?\\" before the man escapes, and Gagan loses consciousness. Gagan wakes up and sees everybody looking at him and asks Keshav \\"What happened ?\\" Gagan and Keshav go to Yadav's birthday bash where they get drunk. Yadav embraces him, and Gagan wears the spectacles to regain focus. He proceeds to beat up Yadav mercilessly in a similar fashion to his previous fight. Yadav survives, and Gagan wakes up in prison, with no idea of what happened at the party. Gagan gets bail on the case of mental illness, and the media quickly picks up Gagan's story, focusing that he lives in a supposedly haunted house. An observer (Prakash Belawadi) explains the suicide of his niece Shruthi, which occurred in that house. Sakshi then reveals that the location of the number of the person Gagan wants to know is the same house. Gagan is shocked and reveals the person to be Shruthi. Shruthi (Anupama Parameswaran) was a junior lawyer who befriended Gagan after reading the article he wrote on the disabled. She starts living with him in Kolkata. They both prepare articles to file a case against Yadav. He proposed her and asked her to call him after she reaches Bengaluru for her answer, but he hadn't received a call from her since their meeting, hence Gagan was searching the location of that number. Gagan is then taken to Guruji's (Achyuth Kumar) ashram instead of a mental hospital, where a puja is being performed to get rid of the spirit that has invaded Gagan. Gagan wears the spectacles as the pooja is being performed, which is revealed to be the same spectacles that Shruthi wore. He violently kills Yadav's lawyer, before moving to Yadav. Yadav holds Shruthi's uncle as hostage before someone delivers a final blow. The film flash-forwards to the court where Guruji says that he has seen the violent nature of the spirit while doctors say that he has multiple personality disorder. The court orders Gagan to be sent to a mental hospital due to multiple personality disorder. The film then flashes back to the fight, where Gagan stabs Shruthi's uncle before violently killing Yadav. Gagan then reveals to Guruji that he was never possessed by anyone. Gagan recalls his video chat with Shruthi after she had gone home and witnesses Yadav, the lawyer, and her uncle murdering her. Gagan said that in his mind, the thought of taking revenge came but never any spirit. He then plotted revenge and gave himself a possessed facade using the spectacles. Gagan explains that he will be proven both spiritually and scientifically innocent by the court of law and forces Guruji to lie in front of media. Back in court, Gagan is in a mental hospital van and sees Guruji in a car who without blinking eyes, looks at him. As Guruji's car leaves, he smiles indicating that he has completed his revenge and the title Natasaarvabhowma (Emperor of Actors) has gained full meaning.

At one time a leading member of the Democratic Party of Serbia (Demokratska stranka Srbije, DSS), he has served with the Serbian Progressive Party since 2010. Early life, career, and private life Šormaz was born in Drvar, in what was then the Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. His father was a judge and his family moved frequently in his youth; he lived at different times in Lebane, Negotin, Velika Plana, and Požarevac. He is now based in Smederevo and has a background in labour relations.DRAGAN ŠORMAZ, Otvoreni Parlament, accessed 22 June 2018. Šormaz is a huge fan of hard rock and heavy metal. According to an article in Danas, he once told his colleagues of his disappointment at having to attend of political meeting while Metallica and Def Leppard were playing in Sofia, Bulgaria.D. Petrović, \\"Ličnost Danas: Dragan Šormaz\\", Danas, 13 May 2010, accessed 22 June 2018. Political career Democratic Party of Serbia Šormaz joined the DSS on its formation in 1992. He was an opponent of Slobodan Milošević's administration throughout the 1990s and led the DSS municipal committee in Smederevo in 2000; in an interview from this period, he said that police had threatened members of his party with arrest if they took part in an anti-Milošević protest.\\"Police threaten opposition against supporting independent media,\\" British Broadcasting Corporation Monitoring Service: Central Europe and Balkans, 20 May 2000 (Source: Beta news agency, Belgrade, in Serbo-Croat 1507 gmt 18 May 00). Milošević was defeated by DSS leader Vojislav Koštunica in the September 2000 Yugoslavian presidential election, an event that precipitated a large-scale change in Yugoslavian and Serbian politics. The DSS contested the subsequent 2000 Serbian parliamentary election as part of the Democratic Opposition of Serbia, a broad and ideologically diverse coalition of parties that had opposed Milošević's regime. Šormaz received the sixty-first position on the DOS's electoral list and was awarded a mandate after the list won a landslide victory with 176 out of 250 seats.Избори за народне посланике Народне скупштине одржани 23. децембра 2000. године и 10. јануара 2001. године, ИЗБОРНЕ ЛИСТЕ (Демократска опозиција Србије – др Војислав Коштуница (Демократска странка, Демократска странка Србије, Социјалдемократија, Грађански савез Србије, Демохришћанска странка Србије, Нова Србија, Покрет за демократску Србију, Лига социјалдемократа Војводине, Реформска демократска странка Војводине, Коалиција Војводина, Савез војвођанских Мађара, Демократска алтернатива, Демократски центар, Нова демократија, Социјалдемократска унија, Санxачка демократска партија, Лига за Шумадију, Српски покрет отпора – Демократски покрет) , Republika Srbija - Republička izborna komisija, accessed 30 March 2017. (From 2000 to 2011, parliamentary mandates were awarded to sponsoring parties or coalitions rather than to individual candidates, and the mandates were often awarded out of numerical order. Šormaz did not automatically receive a mandate by virtue of his position on the list.)Serbia's Law on the Election of Representatives (2000) stipulated that parliamentary mandates would be awarded to electoral lists (Article 80) that crossed the electoral threshold (Article 81), that mandates would be given to candidates appearing on the relevant lists (Article 83), and that the submitters of the lists were responsible for selecting their parliamentary delegations within ten days of the final results being published (Article 84).

After the election, the DOS formed a new administration under the leadership of Democratic Party (Demokratska stranka, DS) leader Zoran Đinđić. In 2002, the DSS left the DOS and moved to the opposition, emerging as prominent rivals of the DS. Đinđić was assassinated in 2003. The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was officially reconstituted as the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro in February 2003, and the Assembly of Serbia and Montenegro was established as its legislative branch. The first members of this body were chosen by indirect election from the republican parliaments of Serbia and Montenegro, with each parliamentary group allowed representation proportional to its numbers. Only sitting members of the Serbian assembly or the Montenegrin assembly, or members of the Federal Assembly of Yugoslavia at the time of the country's reconstitution, were eligible to serve. The DDS was permitted seventeen members in the federal assembly, and Šormaz was included in the party's delegation.\\"Poslanici nove države\\", Glas Javnosti, 20 February 2003, accessed 31 May 2018. He served in this role until a new federal assembly delegation was selected in early 2004; he also continued to serve in the National Assembly during this time. Šormaz received the thirty-sixth position on the DSS's electoral list for the 2003 parliamentary election and was awarded a mandate after the list won fifty-three seats.Избори за народне посланике Народне скупштине одржани 28. децембра 2003. године, ИЗБОРНЕ ЛИСТЕ (ДЕМОКРАТСКА СТРАНКА СРБИЈЕ - ВОЈИСЛАВ КОШТУНИЦА) , Republika Srbija - Republička izborna komisija, accessed 28 April 2017.PRVA SEDNICA, 27.01.2004., Otvoreni Parlament, accessed 24 June 2018.

He also stated that Serbia could resolve the status of Kosovo by military means if it so chose, provided the international community did not interfere, although he added, \\"that is not the option we choose.\\" He argued in favour of a political solution with Kosovo and Metohija receiving greater autonomy as a province in Serbia.\\"Serbian politicians cautious over Radical assertion of possible conflict,\\" British Broadcasting Corporation Monitoring European, 19 December 2004 (Source: Politika, Belgrade, in Serbian 15 Dec 04 p 3).

This controversy led to a serious rift between the parties.\\"Serbian president's party sees criticism of NATO as 'party politics',\\" British Broadcasting Corporation Monitoring European, 21 August 2007 (Source: Glas javnosti, Belgrade, in Serbian 20 Aug 07).

Shultz, 416 U.S. 21 (1974), was a US Supreme Court case in which the Court held that the Bank Secrecy Act, passed by Congress in 1970 requiring banks to record all transactions and report certain domestic and foreign transactions of high dollar amounts to the United States Treasury, did not violate the First, Fourth, and Fifth Amendments of the US Constitution..  Background  The Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 was passed as Congress had come to recognize that bank records had a high value in criminal investigations and regulatory actions from both domestic and foreign sources. The Act at passage had two key titles: Title I requiring banks to record all bank transactions and Title II to report certain events triggered by these transactions to appropriate government authorities, such as domestic transactions that totaled more than within a single day or the transfer of funding in or out of the United States exceeding . After the Act was passed and the processes used to enforce it were established by the United States Department of the Treasury, several groups sought to challenge the Act on several constitutional counts and filed suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California around June 1972, requesting a restraining order from implementation of the Act. The groups included bank customers, the Security National Bank, the California Bankers Association, and the American Civil Liberties Union. Their primary complaint identified that the record keeping and reporting requirements of the Act violated Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable search and seizure; other complaints included challenges based on the First, Fifth, Ninth, Tenth, and Fourteenth Amendments. The District Court granted the order while it reviewed the case. Ultimately, the three-judge panel ruled that nearly all of the Act was constitutional, but it found that the Title II reporting requirements on domestic transactions represented an unconstitutional violation of Fourth Amendment protection since it could allow the Treasury to obtain under subpoena all bank records of a person. Supreme Court Both the plaintiffs and the government filed appeals on the mixed conclusion from the District Court to the Supreme Court. The Court opted to combine the three separate petitions into a single case: * The California Bankers Association, which represented banks operating in California, argued that the Title I record- keeping requirements violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, as it placed an unreasonable expectation on the banks, and that this also violated the rights of privacy offered by the First Amendment. * The Security National Bank, the ACLU, and the various bank customers asserts, in addition to the California Bankers Association, that the Title II reporting requirements related to foreign transactions violated the First and Fourth Amendments, as well as creating compulsory self-incrimination against the Fifth Amendment. * The United States Government appealed on the constitutionality of the Title II reporting requirements for domestic transactions, arguing that the Court should have reviewed the Treasury's process for any Fourth Amendment violations, and not the Act itself. Oral hearings were given on January 26, 1974. The Court issued its opinion on April 1, 1974. Justice William Rehnquist delivered the majority opinion, which was joined by Justices Burger, Stewart, White, Blackmun, and Powell. The decision ruled across ten points from the three petitions but effectively found that neither the recordkeeping requirements of Title I nor the reporting requirements of Title II of the Act violated First, Fourth, or Fifth Amendment rights or due process rights under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. The decision affirming the constitutionality of the law also expressed concern that some of the parties, such as the bank customers, the California Bankers Association, and the ACLU, did not show any direct harm from the Act and so lacked Article III standing to challenge the law. Justice Powell wrote a concurring opinion, joined by Justice Blackmun, which affirmed that having a reasonably-high amount, , requiring recording and reporting did not violate privacy rights, but he expressed concern that more government intrusion into bank records could impact privacy rights. Justice Douglas wrote a dissenting opinion. He was joined in part by Justice Brennan on points related on his opinion that the California Bankers Association had standing in the case and that there were significant privacy rights that could be violated by having banks record every transaction of their customers, which the government could have the capability to pull. Justice Douglas continued in his dissent concerns that through the Act, Congress gave the Secretary of the Treasury powers at their discretion that could violate the Fourth Amendment. Justice Brennan also wrote a dissenting opinion, further expressing on Justice Douglas' opinion about the Act giving Secretary of the Treasure excessive powers that would invade privacy rights. Justice Marshall wrote another dissenting opinion that stated Katz v. United States allowed the records to be kept by banks under the Act to be seen as an intangible extension of a person's private property and so the Act violated the Fourth Amendment.

Some of the most vicious gangs, like the Dooney Boys and the 39ers Gang, moved to other cities and clashed with each other in a violent gun battle. New Orleans gangs became involved in violent crime and murders in host cities like Atlanta, Houston, North Las Vegas, Oklahoma City, and Sacramento. In 2012, Mayor Landrieu formed the Multi-Agency Gang (MAG) Unit, which is the key enforcement component of the Group Violence Reduction Strategy (GVRS).

He is widely celebrated for saving tens of thousands of Jews in Nazi-occupied Hungary during the Holocaust from German Nazis and Hungarian Fascists during the later stages of World War II. He received many awards for his humanitarian activities.  Honours  Wallenberg was nominated twice for the Nobel Peace Prize, in 1948 by more than 50 qualified nominators and in 1949 by a single nominator At the time, the prize could be awarded posthumously, but the concept of such awards was controversial.  Argentina  In Buenos Aires, there is a monument in honour of Wallenberg at a park. It is a replica of the London monument by Philip Jackson, was unveiled in 1998 and can be seen from the Figueroa Alcorta Avenue, in Recoleta neighbourhood.  Australia  In Melbourne, a small memorial in honour of Wallenberg stands at the Jewish Holocaust Museum and Research Centre; a monument by the sculptor Karl Duldig dedicated to him is at Kew Junction on the corner of Princess Street and High Street, Kew; and a tree and memorial seat are in Carlisle St at St Kilda Town Hall. The Australian Centre for Clinical Neuropharmacology in Melbourne adopted the name 'The Raoul Wallenberg Centre' on the occasion of Raoul Wallenberg's 89th birthday. In Sydney are a Raoul Wallenberg garden and sculpture in Woollahra, and a statue inside the Jewish Museum of Australia. Commemorative trees have been planted in front of the federal Parliament and in many other locations. Established in 1985, Raoul Wallenberg Unit of B'nai B'rith in Melbourne, Australia, with Max Stern & Co, a leading stamp dealer in Melbourne, and Australia Post, released a limited edition Raoul Wallenberg Stamp Sheet and Envelope Set to mark the Unit's 25th anniversary in 2010. The Stamp Sheet shows a photo of Raoul Wallenberg together with a brief outline of his life, a monument in honour of Raoul Wallenberg by artist, Karl Duldig, in the Raoul Wallenberg Garden at Kew Junction, Melbourne, and ten 60 cent Australia Post stamps with tabs of Raoul Wallenberg from early childhood to adult soldier. The Envelope has a transparent front to show the Stamp Sheet; a Schutzpass is shown on the back accompanied by an explanation. To commemorate the Centenary Year, a limited number of the Raoul Wallenberg Stamp Sheet were stamped with a special Centenary cancellation. These are available from Raoul Wallenberg Unit of B'nai B'rith in Melbourne. Raoul Wallenberg Unit requested clergy around the world to speak about Raoul Wallenberg and his heroic deeds - 'One Person can Make a Difference' - from their pulpits over the weekend 3–5 August 2012 which coincided with the date of his 100th birthday, 4 August 2012. Raoul Wallenberg Reserve in the neighbourhood of Yokine in Perth was dedicated in honour of Raoul Wallenberg. The small park is located in close proximity to many of Perth's Jewish institutions including a Jewish Day School, aged care facility, community centre, sports club and orthodox synagogue. Wallenberg was named Australia's first honorary citizen in April 2013, during his centenary year. Frank Vajda AM was saved by Wallenberg in 1944 from the pro-Nazi Arrow Cross Party and campaigned for decades for him to be recognised with the award. A ceremony at Government House, Canberra, to mark the occasion was held on 6 May 2013, and was attended by Governor-General Quentin Bryce AC CVO, Prime Minister Julia Gillard, and Opposition Leader Tony Abbott. Vajda also attended the ceremony, as did the son of World War II resistance fighter John Farkas, who was the last person known to have seen Wallenberg alive. George Farkas described the award as \\"recognition that some people can do unbelievable good in the face of reprehensible evil\\". A 70 cent Raoul Wallenberg postage stamp and associated philatelic items were released by Australia Post on 5 October 2015, one of three to by honoured in this manner by Australia; the other two are Mother Teresa and Nelson Mandela.  Austria  In the 22nd district of Vienna a street was named \\"Raoul-Wallenberg-Gasse\\".  Canada  Wallenberg was made the first Honorary Citizen of Canada in 1985; and the government declared 17 January, the day he disappeared, as \\"Raoul Wallenberg Day\\" in Canada.

The University's Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning also awards Wallenberg Scholarships to exceptional undergraduate students in their final Senior-Year studio class, which is given to enable students to broaden their study of architecture to include work in distant locations, following Wallenberg's Grandfather's wish for him to be a \\"citizen of the world\\". The projects which won the scholarship in recent years addressed Chinese relations, nuclear accident cleanup, and the recent thaw of US-Cuban relations. The Scholarship gives out on average anywhere between $10,000 to $20,000 for travel-related expenses.

Background  In November 1918, the remaining German units started to withdraw from the Donbass and the collaborating Ukrainian State under Pavlo Skoropadskyi collapsed. The Ataman of the Don Army Pyotr Krasnov, with the consent of Hetman Skoropadskyi with whom he had good previous relations, advanced into the Donbass with parts of the 3rd and 2nd Don divisions, entered Lugansk (November 19) and took controle of the Lugansk and Slovianoserbsk districts. By December 3, the Cossacks had entered Debaltsevo, Donetsk and Mariupol. However, after the defeat in the Voronezh–Povorino Operation and retreat to the Don of the main forces of the Don Army, it became clear that the 2 Don divisions alone could not hold out in the Donbass. That defeat and the successful advance of the Red Army in Northern Ukraine forced General Denikin to abandon the plan of an offensive up the Volga to Tsaritsyn, and he began transferring forces to support the retreating Don Army and to defend the Donbass and the Crimea, which had fallen under control of the liberal Crimean Regional Government. He did this to prevent the Red Army an access to the Northern Caucasus in the rear of his AFSR Army. Another consideration was the economic importance of the Donetsk basin. At the end of December 1918, Denikin moved parts of the 3rd division from Stavropol under the command of General Vladimir May-Mayevsky to the Donbass.  White offensive  On January 12, the Whites launched an offensive from Donbass to the area where Nestor Makhno's rebel detachments were deployed, took Polohy on January 20, and on January 21–22 attacked Gulyai-Polye. The fierce battles for Gulyai-Pole lasted several days, during which the village passed several times from hand to hand. The Black Guards took up to 1,000 casualties, and were forced to retreat to Gaichur station, after which the Makhno - White Guard front was stabilized. The Kozhevnikov Group, which formed the right wing of the Southern Red Front launched an offensive from Kupyansk towards Lugansk and the Donbass in the first half of January. By January 14 the Reds occupied Starobilsk and entered the Northern Donbass, having seized the stations Logvinovo, Popasnaya, Kramatorskaya, Slavyansk and came within 12 km of Bakhmut. On January 16 the Reds took Bilovodsk. Parts of the Ukrainian Front, which by mid-January had taken the Lozovaya-Sinelnikovo line, could strike the Donbass from the West, but Central Command, which did not attach much importance to the appearance of Denikin's units, entrusted the conquest of the region to the Southern Front alone. Kozhevnikov's units occupied Kostiantynivka and Bakhmut on January 20, and the next day they attacked towards the Don from Lugansk. On January 22-23, the Don Army counterattacked from Nikitovka, Lihoy, Millerovo and Debaltsevo, but were repulsed. From January 25, reinforcements for the May-Mayevsky detachment arrived. His task was to hold the Mariupol - Donetsk - Bahmut - Lugansk line. On January 31, Kozhevnikov launched a new offensive at the junction between the Volunteer and the Don units, around Debaltsevo. Two weeks of heavy fighting followed with attacks and counter-attacks. On February 8, the Makhno brigade recaptured Polohy, creating a serious threat to the flank of the Volunteers. On February 13-15, the Bolshevik High Command decided a gradual regrouping of the forces of the Southern Front from February 10 to March 6, in preparation for a final attack on the Donbass. The left flank of the Kozhevnikov group, together with the adjacent 8th Army, were to break through near Millerovo. In mid-February, Denikin began the transfer to the Lugansk area, the 1st Caucasus Equestrian Division of Andrei Shkuro, the First Kuban Cossack Division of the Corps of Viktor Pokrovsky, the First Terek Cossack Division under S. M. Toporkov and other units. Pokrovsky took command of the Corps, composed of the First Kuban and one of the Don divisions. By mid-March, the Caucasian Volunteer Army, whose front ran from Kolpakovo station to Volnovakha and Mariupol, numbered 12,000 soldiers. She was opposed by 40-50 thousand Reds.  March offensive of the Southern Front  On February 24, the Reds attacked the Baronsky station on the Debaltsevo-Lugansk line. Again, the area around Debaltsevo turned into the central point of the struggle in the Southern theater of the Civil War. After three weeks of almost continuous fighting in the Debaltsevo area, units of the 13th Red Army attacked from the Northwest on March 15 and forced the depleted Volunteer battalions to retreat from Debaltsevo. The Red Commander-in-chief Jukums Vacietis on March 12 ordered the Ukrainian Front to join forces with the Southern Front to liquidate the White Army in the Donbass. But its commander, Vladimir Antonov-Ovseyenko, said he did not have the resources for this, since they were necessary to repulse Petliura's advance to Kiev and deal with the Entente troops on the Black Sea coast. On March 20, the Red Army captured Donesk and by March 27 pushed the enemy towards the south and west of the Donetsk basin. The general situation at the front became unfavorable for the White Army. On March the Red 1st Zadneprovskaya division of Pavel Dybenko seized Melitopol, cutting the White Azov Front in two. Troops of the Entente left Kherson (March 8) and Nikolaev (March 16) and Makhno seized Berdyansk on March 15 and Mariupol on March 29. To the North, Makhno's detachments seized Volnovakha on March 17 and were preparing to advance on Taganrog. The commander of the Red Army Vatsetis demanded more decisive actions from the Southern Front in the Donetsk and Lugansk area. On March 27, he issued an order to seize the Donbass in the shortest possible time. A renewed offensive by the forces of the Soviet 13th and 8th armies was to begin on March 29. Makhno's force was sent to the right flank of the 13th Army to attack the Donbass from the Southwest. The 9th Red Division, withdrawn from the Ukrainian front, was sent from Ekaterinoslav. The 13th and 8th armies numbered 26,000 bayonets and 3,300 sabers, which were soon to be joined by the 12th Infantry Division (10,000 bayonets, 200 sabers). Makhno's force had another 10,000 soldiers, so the Reds could count on 40-50,000 soldiers, against 7,000 under May-Mayevsky and 19,000 under Pokrovsky. The offensive began on March 29 before all reinforcements had arrived, and the plan did not take into account the real situation of the 13th Army, which had suffered heavy losses during a month of heavy fighting. The Whites knew the enemy's plan and counterattacked. The division of Pokrovsky defeated the 41st Division on the 29th and threw it back on Lugansk. The 8th Army came to its help, but Pokrovsky easily defeated them and on April 2 threw it also back on Lugansk, which was only held thanks to the approach of units of the 12th Division. Shkuro broke through the front of the Reds at Krindachyovka and on March 30 took Debaltsevo. Then he turned south and surprised an enemy's division on the march, cut it to pieces and took 5,000 prisoners. For the next two weeks, Shkuro's force raged havoc in the rear of the Red Army.  April offensive of the Southern Front  The actions of Pokrovsky and Shkuro had prevented the advance of the Southern Front in the Donbass, but on April 1 Gittis developed a new plan. Using the fact that the water in the Donets began to subside, he decided to include the 9th Army in the operations in the Donbass. The 16th and 23rd Infantry Divisions, together with the left flank of the 8th Army and the 12th Division, were to advance in the direction of the right flank and the rear of the Volunteer Army. The April offensive had chances of success, as the forces of the Volunteer Army and the Shock Group of the Don Army did not exceed 15-16,000 soldiers, but then in the rear of the Reds the Vyoshenskaya Uprising began. To suppress it, it was necessary to divert 14,000 soldiers from the 8th and 9th armies. The 23rd Red division, which came from Kamianske and occupied the Repnaya station, was attacked and defeated by the Don Army's horse brigade under N.P. Kalinin, suffering heavy losses. The 16th Red division managed to gain a foothold in the Kalitva bridgehead but was held there for 4-5 weeks, by Kalinins troops. By April 19, the 9th Army ceased operations. On April 13, the 8th Army launched an offensive in the Kolpakovo district, but by April 26 had only advanced 10 km south of Pervozvanovka and 35 km southeast of Lugansk. There it was attacked by Shkuro's Corps, which inflicted several successive blows on the enemy, threw them back towards the west and took Lugansk on May 5. Also the 13th Army attempted a new offensive on the 18th, but the Whites took Yenakiyevo and for several days repulsed constant enemy attacks.  May offensive of the Southern Front  After four months of fighting, the opponents were exhausted, however, the Red command made one last effort to launch an offensive in the Donbass, taking advantage of the fact that the 10th Army had pinned down significant forces of Denikin. The offensive was undertaken in unfavorable conditions, since by May 8 Denikin had chased the 10th Army out of Manych, the Vyoshenskaya Uprising had spread in the Don, in the beginning of the month Grigoriev had rebelled in the Ukraine, and the center could not send significant reinforcements to the Southern Front, since all forces were needed to fight with Kolchaks Siberian Army. The 9th Army on May 10 crossed the Donets north of Gundorovskaya. The 8th Army launched the offensive on May 14, and on the next day retook Lugansk. The 13th Army attacked Ilovaisk and Kuteinikovo. Because of the lack of reserves, the initial successes of the Red advance turned out to be temporary. On May 19, Shkuro's units attacked the 2nd Ukrainian Soviet Army (Makhno group) and the right flank of the 13th Army (9th Division). On the first day the cavalry broke through their front and penetrated some 45 km in the direction of the station Yelenovka. By May 23, the front was broken over a width of 30 km, and Makhno's troops were pushed back some 100 km to the West. White victory The defeat of the Red Southern Front and the defeat of the 8th, 9th, 13th and 2nd Ukrainian armies allowed the Volunteer Army to launch a major attack towards the North and West. In June, the Whites undertook a successful offensive in Northern Tavria and in the directions of Yekaterinoslav and Kharkov. The 13th Army, made ever weaker by failed attacks on the White's positions, were counterattacked on May 22nd on the Khartsyzsk-Krinichnaya line. Shkuro's cavalry captured Donetsk (Yuzovka) and Avdeevka and the Kornilov division took Debaltsevo. The White cavalry broke through the front at the junction of the 13th and 8th armies, occupied Lugansk on 27 May and threatened to encircle the right flank of the 13th. On May 27-31, the 13th Army retreated in disorder to the North, stopping only a month later in the area of Novy Oskol, 250 km from the Donbass. On May 24, the Don cavalry of General A.S. Secretev crossed the Donets in the village of Dubova and struck at the junction between the 16th and 23rd divisions of the 9th Army, and on the 29th she already reached the Millerovo station, situated some 75 km in the rear of the Red Army. The 9th Army was cut in two and ceased to exist as a combat unit. Sources * * This is a translation of an article in the Russian Wikipedia, Бои за Донбасс (январь — май 1919).

It's a historic temple in the area of the Front Palace, similar to Wat Phra Kaew inside the Grand Palace. Because the temple is situated in a palace, no monks live inside it. The temple is located at 4 Rachini Road, Phra Borom Maha Ratchawang Subdistrict, Phra Nakhon District, Bangkok within Bunditpatanasilpa Institute in front of foot of Phra Pinklao Bridge opposite the entrance of Soi Rambuttri near Tha Chang Wang Na and Bangkok Tourism Division, Culture, Sports and Tourism Department, next to the National Theater. This temple is also known as Wat Phra Kaew Wang Na (วัดพระแก้ววังหน้า; literally: \\"Temple of the Emerald Buddha at Front Palace\\"). Wat Bowon Sathan Sutthawat was built by Prince Sakdiphonlasep, viceroy of King Nangklao (Rama III) in the early Rattanakosin era, but it was not finished in his lifetime. The temple was completed in the reign of King Mongkut (Rama IV). The mural in the interior depicts the legend of the Phra Phuttha Sihing Buddha image and the lives of the 28 Buddhas. The interior of the ubosot (ordination hall) contains traditional Thai-style murals. Currently the temple is not in use as a traditional religious site and is little known to the public. The Fine Arts Department often uses the ubosot for rituals such as wai khru (teacher appreciation ritual), krob khru (teacher initiation ritual), and other sacred ceremonies to do with traditional dance and musical artists.

Pinto ran as a candidate of the Israeli political party The New Right for the April 2019 Israeli legislative election, and ran as a candidate of the Yamina alliance in the September 2019 Israeli legislative election and in the 2020 Israeli legislative election. Her profession was an internship in a law firm.  Biography  Pinto was born to Deaf parents, and raised in the Krayot. Her mother is Deaf and blind and she has a younger brother who hears. Her mother is an actress in the theater \\"Nalaga'at\\". Pinto studied at the Carmel Zvulun Regional High School in the kibbutz Yagur, in the graphic design and social science trends, and received a full matriculation diploma with excellence. Pinto made most of her childhood with her mother's parents, as well as with her her signing parents. This way she acquired a full knowledge of two languages, Israeli sign language alongside the Hebrew language, which gave her emotional strength and self esteem between the two worlds. Since her childhood, she has seen the difficulty and lack of linguistic accessibility in her parents, who coped daily with the authorities and the general public. Pinto's life was also a daily struggle because of a lack of awareness in the public. When she grew up, she decided to devote her life to change this reality of Deaf and hard of hearing people. In the Israel Defense Forces Pinto served in the Israeli Air Force Technical Corps as a project manager of logistics in the Equipment Group, performed and conducted orders which were acquired in a large scale out of Israel, and coordinated front air bases on procurement and supply. She continued on a permanent service, and in 2009 she received an outstanding medal from the Air Force commander and the President's outstanding medal from Shimon Peres. In 2011, after completing her military service, she went to Bachelor of Laws studies at the Netanya Academic College and participated the excellence program of the college. During her studies, as a part of a course in labor law, she participated in a delegation to the International Labour Organization and the United Nations in Geneva. In 2013 she was a legal assistant of the Judge Benjamin Arnon in the Central District Court for a year, as a framework of the actual practice of law and judicial by the college. In 2014 she specialized by Member of Knesset Karin Elharar, and handled legislation, public appeals and assistance of adapting to people with disabilities. Since 2016 Pinto has been a lecturer in the course of \\"Translation at Courts and Police Investigations\\", at the studies of Sign Language Interpreting, Bar-Ilan University. In 2017 Pinto was an intern at the law office of Furth, Wilensky, Mizrachi and Knaani. Pinto lives in Ramat Gan, and is married to Michael Kadosh, a Deaf man who immigrated from the United States, is a player in the Israeli Futsal national team and is employed as an engineer in telecommunications in Israel. In February 2018 a son was born to them.  Public Activity  Israeli President's House at a special \\"Leadership and Disability\\" meeting, in which a research and a survey of the public attitudes towards leadership of people with disabilities were presented, January 2018 In 2014 Pinto joined as a student the \\"Shema for education and rehabilitation of Deaf and hard of hearing children and youth\\", and was employed as an instructor and an informal educational activity coordinator. Later she was appointed as a manager of the Gush Dan club, and led a fundraising evening for the enrichment of the children's clubs activity, which ended successfully. In May 2015, she represented Israel in India by a delegation on her own initiative with a Deaf partner, for an assistance and a legal-educational counseling to children and Deaf youth in Indore. Before the end of her role as the club director in 2016, she established with other Deaf founders, in order to promote the status of Deaf and hard of hearing people who used sign language, to recognize the equality of sign language and spoken languages, and to create an awareness to the need of the Deaf to be accessible and accepted by the general public. Afterwards, Pinto founded the campaign \\"I sign I am Equal\\" for changing the consciousness of the importance of sign language in public, and for promoting legislation of the Israeli Sign Language as a recognized language in Israel. Under this campaign, she led a awareness week of the Deaf people in September 2016,, September 18, 2016 whose title was \\"I sign, I am whole\\". The campaign swept hundreds of thousands of surfers, and the Education Minister Naftali Bennett joined it. Following the campaign, Ben- Gurion University of the Negev was the first university in Israel which recognized the Israeli Sign Language as an official language for the Deaf people in Israel. In March 2017, there was a ceremony at the Ben-Gurion University, in which Pinto gave a certificate of appreciation from the Center for the Deaf Studies to Rivka Carmi, the president of the university, for the university recognition in the Israeli sign language. In the early 2017, Pinto initiated a bill to make public service announcements on the television in sign language, which was led by MK Issawi Frej and MK Eitan Cabel. Pinto, in cooperation with the Ruderman Family Foundation, arranged a meeting of the actress Marlee Matlin with the community of the Deaf and hard of hearing people in Israel. The meeting was named \\"Sign of Success\\" and was held at the Tel Aviv Cinematheque. Over 300 people from Israel’s Deaf community came to the meeting, and Pinto guided the event. The event focused on breaking the glass ceiling of the Deaf people, and realizing the potential in the face of barriers and obstacles. Pinto raised a series of fundamental failures which Deaf and hard of hearing people encountered in Israel, in the print and broadcast media as well as in the Knesset committees. These failures were expressed by the lack of accessibility and absence of public recognition of sign language in the education system, employment, health and law.

She was sentenced to eight years in labour camp detention in 1937 and deported to Karaganda, where she is believed to have died during 1943/44.  Biography  Grete Wilde was born in Berlin into a family of butchers. She herself received a commercial education and embarked on a career of office work. She joined the Young Socialists in January 1919. She joined the recently launched Communist Party in 1921. She was a Communist youth leader in a district of Berlin till March 1922. That was when she joined the regional leadership team (Berzirksleitung) for the Young Communists for Berlin-Brandenburg. In Autumn 1923 she became secretary for the Berlin-Brandenburg Young Communists. Between 1924 and 1926 Grete Wilde represented Berlin in the secretariat of the Young Communist League Central Committee. She travelled to Moscow in 1927. Till 1930 she was a student at the International Lenin School. After that she became an instructor in the Cadre Department of the Communist International (\\"Comintern\\"). In 1931 she was posted to Vienna where she worked under Wilhelm Knorin as a Central Committee instructor with the Austrian Communist Party. Later she moved to Turkey where she undertook similar party work. In Ankara she became a close friend of the poet Nâzım Hikmet and his young son. Howeer, she was arrested and in December 1932 sentenced to a four-year prison term for \\"Communist activities\\". An amnesty enabled Wilde to return to the Soviet Union. She was given the party name \\"Erna Martens\\", and from 1935 worked in the Comintern's Cadre department in Moscow: her duties included gathering information on so-called \\"pests\\" (\\"Schädlinge\\") in the cadres. In Ankara she lived with Resat Fuat Baraner (1900–1968), a Turkish communist and Comintern representative. Their son Klaus was born in Moscow on 19 July 1935. Wilde and her colleague Georg Brückmann were closely involved in the \\"Great Purge\\". A large number of political exiles from Nazi Germany sought refuge in Moscow during the mid-1930s and there were concerns on the part of the leadership that these might include people who dabbled with the thought that Leon Trotsky might have made a better successor to Lenin than Joseph Stalin. Walde and Brückmann undertook verification checks on many of the German political exiles. They became directly involved with the Münzenberg Trust (\\"Apparat\\"). In the summer of 1937 Grete Wilde herself fell victim to the purges sweeping through the German expatriate community in Moscow. On 4 August 1937 she was excluded from the party group cadre, condemned for \\"[1] taking part in the faction struggle of the Ruth Fischer Maslow Group against the party leadership in 1923, [2] associating with elements hostile to the party and to the Soviet Union such as Schatzkin, Lominadse and Vujovic, [3] unprincipled opposition to the leadership of the Lenin School in 1928, [4] leading a group struggle against the Austrian Communist Party in 1931 and [5] incriminating a Turkish Party comrade to the Turkish Police\\". Grete Wilde was arrested by the NKVD in Moscow on 5 October 1937. She faced a special tribunal \\"on account of membership of the right wing Trotskyite anto-Comintern organisation within the Comintern structure\\". She was sentenced to eight years in a labour camp and immediately deported to deported to Karaganda, where she is believed to have died during 1943/44.  Klaus  Grete Wilde's elder brother, Arthur Wilde (1902–1958), was also a party activist. He emigrated in January 1934, working abroad under the party name \\"Franz Rotter\\" for the Internal Relations department of the Comintern and for Soviet Intelligence. He was active in China during 1934, and in Prague between 1935 and 1937. He returned to Moscow in October 1937, staying with the Comintern till 1939 when he took a teaching post at the Institute for Foreign Languages in Moscow. Later he became an instructor at an Antifascist School at Ogre in the Latvian SSR. He was permitted to return to Germany in April 1955. He arrived back with his wife and with his adoptive son, Klaus, his sister's son.

Nock was Chairman and managing director of the family hardware retail firm, Nock & Kirby, from 1925 to 1979, and was an Alderman of the City of Sydney, rising to become Lord Mayor for two terms in 1938 and 1939. Early life and career Norman Lindfield Nock was born on 11 April 1899 at Lindfield in the Colony of New South Wales, as the youngest child of Thomas Nock and Eliza Jane Simmonds. After receiving his education at Sydney Church of England Grammar School, at age 18 he joined the staff of Farmer & Co's department store in Pitt Street, Sydney. After being rejected for war service on medical grounds, Nock travelled to England in 1919 and worked at Selfridges in London, and later at John Wanamaker & Co in New York. Returning to Australia, Nock joined the family firm of Nock & Kirby, which his father had established in 1894 with Herbert Kirby, and left Australia again in 1923 to establish a branch of the company in London. Nock returned to Sydney in 1925 to take up the post of managing director of Nock & Kirby on the sudden death of his brother, Harold Thomas Nock. Nock undertook an expansion of the business and in 1933 opened a prominent new main store in George Street, Sydney. On 22 October 1927, he married Ethel Evelyna Bradford at St Philip's Church, Sydney. A member of the Retail Traders' Association of New South Wales since 1930, Nock was elected president in 1932. Political career This notability assisted when he joined the conservative Civic Reform Association, and was elected as an alderman for Gipps Ward of the City of Sydney at the 1934 election. In December 1937, when Archibald Howie declined to run for a third term as Lord Mayor, Nock was endorsed by the Civic Reform majority to succeed him for the 1938 term, and was subsequently elected unanimously, with the unusual concurrence of all Labor Party aldermen. As Lord Mayor, Nock caused a degree of controversy when he agreed in June 1938 to make Sydney Town Hall available for a lecture series by Felix von Luckner, a German naval officer and yachtsman, who had links to the Nazi Party. Nock defended his permission on the basis that he understood that the lectures were not of a \\"political nature\\". Nock stood for a second term as Lord Mayor in December 1938 and, in a reflection of his appeal across party divisions, was again elected unanimously with the dual nominations from the Civic Reform and Labor aldermen, which was described as a first for the City of Sydney. Described as having \\"gained the friendship and esteem of all members of the council\\" and \\"very popular in business and State political circles\\", Nock was knighted in the 1939 Birthday Honours, which was conferred by the Governor-General of Australia, Lord Gowrie. As mayor on the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, Nock declared to the 1939 congress of the RSL that \\"We must fight desperately for what we believe to be democracy. We must do what our forefathers did and what you gentlemen have done.\\" Nock later served as chairman of the Lord Mayor's Patriotic and War Fund. Although initially considering a third term as Lord Mayor, Nock decided to follow his Civic Reform party and support the candidacy of Stanley Crick for the 1940 term. In October 1941 Nock informed his colleagues that he would not be standing for re-election as an alderman at the December 1941 election. Later life In April 1940, Nock was appointed as a director of the board of the Royal North Shore Hospital and was later elected as chairman of the board, serving until his retirement in 1969. He also served as a director of David Jones Limited, with Charles Lloyd Jones praising his appointment because of his \\"close knowledge of the retail trade\\". In December 1944, Lloyd Jones stood down as Managing Director of David Jones and Nock succeeded him for a period of fifteen months. Nock also served as member of the National Health and Medical Research Council from 1946 to 1969, president (1954–1969) of the National Roads and Motorists' Association, and a director of Qantas Empire Airways (1961–1966). Nock oversaw the regional expansion of Nock & Kirby, with several new stores in suburban and regional locations opening throughout the 1960s. In 1973, Nock retired as managing director of the family firm, with his son, Graham, succeeding him. Nock nevertheless continued in the firm as chairman of the board until 1979. Graham Nock also served as an Alderman of the City of Sydney for Gipps Ward between 1962 and 1967. Survived by his wife and son, Nock died on 24 June 1990 at Kincumber and was cremated. A lecture theatre at Royal North Shore Hospital was named after him in honour of his role at the hospital and its status as a teaching hospital.

They were among the first African-American state legislators in the United States. Twenty-four of the members were ministers. After most of the legislators voted for losing candidates in the legislature's elections for the U.S. Senate, the white majority conspired to remove the black and mixed- ethnicity members from the Assembly. Most of the black delegates to the state's post-war constitutional convention voted against including into the constitution the right of black legislators to hold office, a vote which Rep. Henry McNeal Turner came to regret. The members were expelled by September 1868. The ex-legislators petitioned the federal government and state courts to intervene. In White v. Clements (June 1869), the Supreme Court of Georgia ruled 2-1 that black people did have a right to hold office in Georgia. In January 1870, commanding general of the District of Georgia Alfred H. Terry began \\"Terry's Purge\\", removing ex-Confederates from the General Assembly, replacing them with Republican runners-up and reinstating the black legislators, resulting in a Republican majority in both houses. From that point, the General Assembly accomplished the ratification of the 15th Amendment, chose new senators to go to Washington, and adopted public education. The work of the Republican majority was short-lived, after the \\"Redeemer\\" Democrats won majorities in both houses in December 1870. The Republican governor, Rufus Bullock, after trying and failing to reinstate federal military rule in Georgia, fled the state. After the Democrats took office they began to enact harsh recriminations against Republicans and African Americans, using terror, intimidation, and the Ku Klux Klan, leading to disenfranchisement by the 1890s. One quarter of the black legislators were killed, threatened, beaten, or jailed. The last African-American legislator, W. H. Rogers, resigned in 1907. Afterwards, no African American held a seat in the Georgia legislature until civil rights attorney Leroy Johnson was elected a Democratic state senator in 1962. The 33 are commemorated in the sculpture Expelled Because of Their Color, on the grounds of the Georgia State Capitol. List of legislators At that time, each State Senator in Georgia represented a single-member district made up of three contiguous counties, numbered from 1 to 44. Population was not considered when drawing State Senate districts. Each State Representative in Georgia represented a county, with counties having between one and three representatives depending on population.

It is on the grounds of the Georgia State Capitol in Atlanta. Inscribed on the base of Riddle's sculpture are the names of the 33 black pioneer legislators of the Georgia General Assembly elected and expelled in 1868 and reinstated in 1870 by an Act of Congress. The Georgia Legislative Black Caucus continues to hold annual events honoring the Original 33.

It contains one species, Nochnitsa geminidens. It the most basal known gorgonopsian and among the smallest members of the clade known to date. Discovery and naming Right side of the holotype block Nochnitsa is known from only one specimen, the holotype KPM 310. It was found in Vanyushonki Member of the Kotelnich red beds, along the Vyatka River in Kirov Oblast, which dates to the latest Guadalupian or early Lopingian epochs. Nochnitsa is named after the Nocnitsa, a nocturnal hag-like creature from Slavic mythology. Its name was intended as a parallel to the Gorgons, similarly hag-like creatures from Greek mythology, which are the namesake of many genera within Gorgonopsia and the clade as a whole. The name also reflects the nocturnal habits inferred for the genus. The type species name, N. geminidens, means \\"twin tooth\\" and refers to one of the autapomorphies of the species, postcanine teeth arranged in pairs. Description Nochnitsa is small for a gorgonopsian, with a skull only long. It had a relatively long snout with five incisors, a canine, and six postcanine teeth on each side. The postcanine teeth are autapomorphic for the genus in being arranged in three pairs of closely placed teeth separated by longer diastemata. In each pair, the posterior tooth is larger. The mandible is relatively slender and lacks a strong \\"chin\\", unlike other gorgonopsians. Classification Dentition Skulls of Viatkogorgon and Nochnitsa (reversed for comparison) Nochnitsa is the most basal known gorgonopsian. Paleobiology Nochnitsa was a small predator, unlike later gorgonopsians which were large-bodied apex predators. It was a relatively rare member of its ecosystem. The apex predators of the Kotelnich faunal assemblage were large-bodied therocephalians such as Gorynychus and Viatkosuchus.

It has been awarded since 1976 by the Axel Springer SE owned- tabloid BILD am Sonntag (BamS), since 2009 in cooperation with Auto Bild. The rules were tightened in 2017. For the first time, the results in everyday fuel consumption had an impact on the grading of the test cars. If the difference between the specified factory consumption and actual consumption was too large on a fixed test track, this led to the deduction of points. In addition, the vehicles were randomly inspected by the independent testing organisation DEKRA. If there were too many deviations from the legal limits applicable from September 2017, the car was disqualified. Tom Drechsler, Editor-in-Chief Auto of the BILD Group: \\"The new tests in the style of doping controls have two consequences: They make the price even more valuable: for the customers and for those who build the cars.\\" In the case of diesel vehicles, the DEKRA test was mainly concerned with nitrogen oxide emissions; in the case of petrol engines, the particle values were determined. The 2018 award ceremony was cancelled on 22 June 2018 due to the current exhaust gas manipulations. History The prize was initiated by the publisher Axel Springer, who commissioned the former BamS author Dr. Hermann Harster to carry it out. In contrast to other car awards such as the Car of the Year, the prizewinners are not determined by journalists or readers, but in two-day test drives by an independent jury of experts, racing drivers and prominent drivers. The award ceremony takes place annually in November in Berlin. With the assumption of editorial responsibility by Peter Maahn, then head of the Auto department at BamS, the criteria of the award were professionalized in 1979. Over the years, the Golden Steering Wheel has developed into an institution which, according to a survey, is the most important German award for automobiles. The award ceremony was broadcast on the ZDF television channel on 12 November 2000. Presented by Johannes B. Kerner, produced by Schwartzkopff-TV, the award winners were presented in Hangar 2 at Tempelhof Airport. After 21 years, Maahn handed over responsibility to his successor Joachim Walther in December 2000. In 2007, the Green Steering Wheel was awarded for the best environmental innovation for the first time. Since this year, Tom Drechsler, Editor-in-Chief Auto of the BILD Group and Editor-in-Chief AUTO BILD, together with Marion Horn, Editor-in-Chief of the BamS, bear overall editorial responsibility for the Golden Steering Wheel. The trophy The Golden Steering Wheel is made of gold plated brass and was designed in November 1975 by the then 82-year-old goldsmith Walter W. Franke.Artikel: Wir stellen vor: Künstler in Langenhorn - Walter W. Franke in De Börner, Langenhorner Heimatblatt, Nr. 12, Dezember 1983, Seite 1 u. 2 Within three days and nights, he carved a 32-centimeter- high pedestal and the 15-centimeter diameter steering wheel from wood. This wooden model then served as a model for the brass casting, which was finally covered with gold. The lettering on the base contains the name of the vehicle class, the vehicle, the manufacturer and the date on which the prize was awarded. The jury In the last 30 years, the international jury that participated in the decision included, among others: Sir Peter Ustinov, Michael Schumacher, Juan Manuel Fangio, Walter Röhrl, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, Thomas Gottschalk, Frank Elstner, Nina Ruge, Jörg Wontorra, David Coulthard, Peter Maffay, Barbara Schöneberger, Nick Heidfeld, Rolf Stommelen or Hans- Joachim Stuck. Only two jurors (Hans Herrmann and Erhard Schwind) have been involved in all 30 decisions to date. The jury traditionally consists of three different groups: technicians, motor sportsmen and celebrities. Each of the groups evaluates different criteria that correspond to their respective automotive know-how. The winner of the Honorary Steering Wheel is not chosen by the jury, but by a panel of BamS editors and publishers. A jury of experts from politics, environmental associations, the automotive industry and automobile clubs will decide on the Green Steering Wheel after a pre-selection by the readers. The Golden Steering Wheel is a reader's choice in the first step. They determine the four models per class that go one lap further and are tested in Balocco in northern Italy. An international jury of experts will examine the winning cars according to various criteria. Among other things, designers evaluate the design there, and connectivity experts check the networking of the cars. Celebrities such as entertainer Barbara Schöneberger and crime scene star Richy Müller rate the driving pleasure and racing drivers such as Formula 3 driver Mick Schumacher and rally legend Walter Röhrl transmission, suspension and brakes. The award ceremony Golden Steering Wheels (Goldene Lenkräder). Except for the years 2000 to 2002, the award ceremony always took place in the Axel-Springer-Haus in Berlin. In the three years mentioned, the Golden Steering Wheel was broadcast on ZDF from Berlin's Tempelhof Airport. The most famous award ceremony was on 9 November 1989, when the Berlin Wall fell. At that time, many guests of the event took the opportunity to visit the eastern sector of the divided city for the first time during the night without checks. Conversely, numerous residents of East Berlin spontaneously attended the after-show party. At the 1999 award ceremony, Nina Ruge suffered minor burns during the burning down of a stage firework, which met with a great response from the media.

And bullying in military means any act that causes physical or mental pain or personal insults to others in an abnormal manner, and the abnormal method means a method that goes against the law or an excessive method that goes beyond common sense. Hazing was enforced mainly under the pretext of establishing military discipline, despite evidence that it did not achieve that goal. Hazing resulted in cases of fragging and suicide, which are referred to as non-combat casualties.박휘락. (2014). 한국군의 악성 병영사고 예방책들의 평가와 대안. 한국의회학회보, 3(1), 155–177. Park, Hwee Rhak. (2014). An Evaluation and Alternatives on Preventive Measures of South Korean Armed Forces in the wake of Serious Accidents in the Barracks. The Korean Parliamentary Studies Review, 3(1), 155–177. History The cause of the hazing in Republic of Korea Armed Forces starts from the beginning of Korean army. So we have to know the history of Korean army first. Ministry of National Defense (South Korea) specifies the roots of its armed forces as the Korean Liberation Army. Which is an organization organized to liberate Korea from Japanese colonial rule. Unlike this definition, however, in the process of the establishment of the Korean Army under the command of the U.S. military government after liberation, military generals from Manchukuo Imperial Army and Japanese Army were at the center of Korean Army. In this process, the Japanese military culture were adopted to Korea army like beating, harsh behavior, strict ranking culture, inferior environment, and emphasis on mental power and it still remained. In addition, the system of conscription, which imposes only duties regardless of citizens' rights, and wages that are ridiculously low compared to other countries, have been combined, leading to an endless number of aimless hazing. Starting with the most basic violence, all kinds of incomprehensible malicious harassment are the main actions. There are also acts of torture among them. There are types of bullying beyond imagination, such as beating with a heated object or forcing to eat bugs. These hazing actions have led to numerous incidents, including a series of suicides or gun shootings caused by bullying. Current situation About 60 percent of the deaths in the South Korean military are suicides each year. According to the research, it has been confirmed that severe beatings, severe beating damage, beating experience, verbal abuse experience, and sexual violence experience have significant effects on the suicidal impulse of the respondent. {   1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 - Total death 343 416 330 359 273 248 230 182 164 158 150 135 124 128 121 134 113 129 143 111 117 101 93 81 75 86 86 - Suicide 129 155 100 103 92 102 101 82 66 79 69 67 64 77 80 75 81 82 97 72 79 67 57 54 51 56 62 } The above data are an annual comparison of total deaths and suicides in the military. Currently, South Korea is in a truce, and it is unusual for so many non-combatant deaths to occur. Also, more than half of the number of suicides among deaths can be seen as a big problem. South Korea's Defense Ministry wanted to bring suicide in the military to a personal level and compare it with the suicide rate in the outside world, but many experts refuted the claim. When joining the Korean military, conscripts were already undergo mental evaluation to screen out mentally ill people. And since there are many suicide prevention systems in the military, it is not right to compare them with external suicide rates. Psychology considers the cause of suicide as a distance, and the nearest cause is actually crucial to executing it. For soldiers, senior soldier is a more direct cause than the breakup of the outside world. Fortunately, the number of suicides in the military is gradually decreasing as a result of the lighting of military human rights and the establishment and activities of military human rights organizations Government actions South Korea's Defense Ministry issued a decree in 2011 to root out the above hazing actions. To ensure anonymous reporting, the agency also provides a service called Defense Help Call to receive reports of all possible crimes and violence that could lead to a suicide. And government has established a military human rights center to further ensure and interest in the human rights of soldiers. Contrary to these efforts, however, the proportion of conscripts has risen, leaving room for trouble. Currently, the government is preparing a policy to lower conscription standards, fearing that the nation's low birthrate will lead to fewer conscripts. Experts say such actions will eventually lead to problems by recruiting personnel who are unable to adapt to the closed military. Hazing in popular culture Since 80% of Korean men are conscripted soldiers and most of them have experienced hazing, it is not difficult to find them in the media.

He was born in Naples, Italy and died in Tehran, Iran. He was buried beside his wife in Doulab Cemetery. Photographing Iran An amateur photographer who spoke Persian, Turkish, and Greek, Pesce self-funded the expedition that produced the first photo collection of Iran's ancient monuments, and presented a copy to Naser al-Din Shah—who was himself a photographic enthusiast—on 29 April 1858. A second copy was also produced from the collection in the same year and was sent to Prince William I, King of Prussia. Another copy was donated to New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art; it contains 75 photographs and is probably the same album that was sent to the Prussian King. The oldest pictures in this collection were taken between 1852 and 1855. There are three photos of Naser al-Din Shah during his younger years and one group picture in the collection. Most of the images show the architecture of Iran during the 1800s. The images hold a unique historical value and illustrate the lives of people from different social classes, including members of the royal court. Although few women have been captured in the photos, it clearly documents the existing social hierarchy. Pesce's photos were shown at the World Harris Exhibition in 1867 and received an honorary award.وب‌گاه آفتاب Persepolis \\"View 20 – Persépolis.

Naser al-Din Shah, who had sent daguerreotypist Jules Richard on an unsuccessful mission to photograph Persepolis in 1850, greatly appreciated Pesce's work. During his reign, he also paid other photographers to come to Iran and capture historical sites.

Etymology  The name Kōpuaranga comes from Māori words meaning 'deep hole' and 'shoal of fish'.  History  The area was a temporary camp used by Scandinavians who had been brought in to clear and settle the Seventy Mile Bush, but could not take up their allotted land until it had been surveyed, and the area was thus known simply as The Camp or The Scandinavian Camp, the camp was officially closed on 31 December 1873, and an estimated 700 people had occupied the camp during its existence. In 1876 a Post Office was opened, named Opaki, however the settlement's name was changed to Dreyerton in 1881, after Danish interpreter Alexander Svend Dreyer, who had accompanied the pioneers and conceived the idea for a township. Dreyerton school was founded in 1885, and in 1897 the school had an average attendance of about forty. One amusing incident during the school's history was the school committee election of 1889, which fell through when only the committee members arrived, and refused to vote for themselves. The school was closed in 1975. The name was changed to Kopuaranga in 1906, after the government assigned railway stations Māori language names. The Wellington Education Board then changed the name of the local school to match the station, and the name of the settlement changed also. Kopuaranga railway station eventually closed in 1983. In December 2019, the approved official geographic name of the locality was gazetted as \\"Kōpuaranga\\".

According to Christian beliefs he converted to Christianity and was martyred on 3 May 1682; thus he is commemorated as a martyr on this day. The only mentions of him are in Christian hagiographies. Legend Ahmet lived in Constantinople during the 1600s and was an official in the Ottoman Turkish government before his conversion. Ahmet owned a Russian concubine whom he allowed to attend one of the Greek Orthodox churches in Constantinople. In time Ahmet began to notice that when his Russian concubine returned from church she was far more gracious and loving than she was before going. Intrigued by this, Ahmet obtained permission to attend the Ecumenical Patriarch's celebration of the Divine Liturgy in Constantinople. Due to his status and identity, his request was not refused, and he was given a special place when he attended. During the Divine Liturgy, Ahmet saw that when the Ecumenical Patriarch blessed the faithful with his trikiri and dikiri his fingers 'beamed' light onto the heads of the faithful Christians, but not his own. Amazed by this miracle, Ahmet requested and received Holy Baptism. Whatever happened during this period, one day a group of arguing officials asked Ahmet for his opinion of their dispute, to which he replied that \\"There is nothing better than Christian faith and Christian God\\". For this he was put before sultan and qadi. After torture and few chances to return to Islam he was subsequentially beheaded on May 3, 1682. He is celebrated on 24 December/6 January in Eastern Orthodoxy by name of Christódoulos (Greek: Χριστόδουλος).

Furr describes it as being \\"identical to Tapp but for the addition of a special announcement, allowing a Declarer to capitalize on a very good hand... spicing up the game considerably.\\"Furr (2009), p. 90. Point Tarock is sometimes confused with its close cousin, Illustrated Tarock.  History and etymology  Point Tarock is one of a family of classical Austrian card games known as Tarock games; so much so, that the area of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire, in which they have a strong tradition, has been described as 'Tarockania'.Tarockania at web.archive.org. Retrieved 19 September 2020. These games have been featured in literature such as Herzmanovsky-Orlando's Masquerade of the Genii and Johann Nestroy's Zu ebener Erde und im ersten Stock. There are numerous variations of Tarock, many still played today, including the challenging four- player games of Königrufen (the \\"game of kings\\"), Zwanzigerrufen and Neunzehnerrufen, the original three-handed game of Tapp Tarock and its derivatives, and the \\"attractive\\" two-hander of Strawman Tarock.Kastner, Hugo (2005). \\"König- oder Zwanz'ger-rufen? Nein, Strohmandeln!\\" in Kartenspiele, p. 38. The earliest known rules for Point Tarock are recorded (as Illustrated Tarock) by Löw in 1954 where he describes it as played \\"according to the rules of the normal Tarock game differing... only in the fact that there are new announcements\\" which the declarer can make and which commit him or her to winning additional points. In 1965, Beck switches the names of the two games referring to this version now as Point Tarock (Pointtarock) . He continues to do so for the next two decades. The only subsequent record of its rules is published by Alscher in 2004 where, again it is referred to as Illustrated Tarock, a name that, however, has become increasingly associated with its more popular and complex cousin.  Name  There is no consensus over the name of this game, which was variously called Point Tarock or Illustrated Tarock (Illustriertes Tarock). Confusingly its more complex cousin is also called Illustrated Tarock or Point Tarock or both. Since illustriertes implies \\"embellished\\", there is a logic in using Point Tarock for this variant which involves point-bidding and Illustrated Tarock for the more complex variant that is embellished (Dummett suggests \\"embroidered\\") with additional announcements and bonuses. The game may in any case now be obsolete, being noticeably absent from Bamberger's successor to Löw's and Beck's Tarock series. Cards The game is played with the 54-card French-suited Industrie und Glück deck. It includes 22 trumps numbered in Roman numerals with the exception of the highest, the Sküs or Fool. The second highest trump, the XXI, is known as the Mond while the lowest trump, I, is called the Pagat. The Sküs, Mond, and Pagat are together known as the Trull or \\"Honours\\" and are worth 5 points each. Other trumps are worth only 1 point. The 32 plain suit cards consist of four courts: King, Queen, Cavalier and Valet, along with four pip cards. The cards rank as follows: *In black suits: King, Queen, Cavalier and Valet 10, 9, 8 and 7 *In red suits: King, Queen, Cavalier and Valet, 1, 2, 3 and 4. Kings and Honours are worth 5 points, Queens 4, Cavaliers 3, Valets 2, and the pips 1. Like score counting in other Tarock games, 2 points are subtracted from each trick taken. There are 70 card points in each deal, so to win, the Declarer needs at least 36 points. Other than card points there are bonus points as described below.  Differences from Illustrated Tarock  Point Tarock is sometimes called Illustrated Tarock, for example by Furr, while others, such as BambergerBamberger (2011), pp. 43-49 and Dummett,Dummett, Twelve Tarot Games, pp. 131-146 refer to Illustrated Tarock as Point Tarock. The main differences are:Beck (1983), pp. 135-143 * Point Tarock has no Zweiblatt (\\"Two Card\\") or Einblatt (\\"One Card\\") contracts * The only announcements are those that offer to score specific numbers of points over 36 (hence the name) * Announcements may be made before or after exchanging with the talon; this affects the value of the contract Rules Shuffling and dealing Dealing takes places as in other three-hand Tarock games. After the cards have been shuffled and cut, the dealer sets out six cards face down on the table (the talon) and then deals each player 16 cards, anticlockwise, in two packets of eight each. Bidding Forehand, to the right of the dealer, now opens the bidding with \\"pass\\" or Dreier. Middlehand may also pass or raise to an Untern. The dealer, rearhand (Hinterhand), may pass or raise. Apart from Solo, the contracts must be bid for in ascending order. A player who has been overbid by a 'younger' or more 'junior' player may \\"hold\\" and has positional priority unless overbid again. The highest bidder becomes the declarer and plays alone against the other two players (the \\"defenders\\"). The bidding increments are as follows: * Dreier - 3 game points. * Unterer - 4 game points. * Oberer - 5 game points. In each case, the declarer exposes the talon, lays out the cards in order and takes either the first or last three cards from the talon. The declarer then discards three cards from her hand and places it onto her trick pile, these three count as her first trick. Kings or Trull cards may not be discarded; other trumps can't be discarded unless there is no other option. All discarded cards must be shown to the defenders. The remaining cards from the talon are added to the defenders' trick pile.  Announcements  Once the declarer has exchanged with the talon, she must decide how good her hand is and then announce the number of card points she will contract to win. The options attract additional game points and are as follows (points from Furr): * with 40 - 3 game points * with 45 - 6 game points * with 50 - 10 game points * with 55 - 15 game points Each bid also includes the lower ones and may be kontra'd in whole or in part. So the declarer may announce \\"with 50!\\" and an opponent may say \\"Kontra the 50!\\" which means the kontra only applies to scores of 50 or more.  Bonuses  The rules on bonuses are variable but typically include: * Pagat Ultimo: any player wins the last trick with Trump I, the Pagat * Valat: player takes all tricks  Winning  If the declarer achieves her target, she wins the points above. If she announced \\"with 50\\" but only scores 46 card points, she pays each defender 1 point i.e. 10 points for the lost \\"with 50\\" minus 3+6 for the won \\"with 40\\" and \\"with 45\\".

It has a single pointed leaf and usually a single white or cream-coloured flower with reddish brown markings. A relatively common species, it usually grows in swampy places. It is distinguished from other bunny orchids by the arrangement of its petals. Description Eriochilus helonomos is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single, egg-shaped glabrous leaf with a pointed tip, long and wide. Usually only a single flower but sometimes as many as three white or cream-coloured flowers about long and wide are borne on a stem, tall. The dorsal sepal is long and wide. The lateral sepals are long and wide and have pink markings on their underside. The petals have brownish red edges and are long and about wide. Unlike others in the genus the petals are pressed against the sides of the column. The labellum is long, wide and curves downwards. It has scattered clusters of dark red and white hairs. Flowering occurs from April to July. Taxonomy and naming Eriochilus helonomos was first formally described in 2006 by Stephen Hopper and Andrew Brown from a specimen collected near Denmark and the description was published in Nuytsia. The specific epithet (helonomos) is derived from an Ancient Greek word meaning \\"living in marshes\\", referring to the usual habitat of this species. Distribution and habitat The swamp bunny orchid grows in swampy places and in seepage areas on granite outcrops. It is found between Dongara and Cape Riche.

The episode was written by showrunner I. Marlene King and directed by Norman Buckley, it aired on June 10, 2014 on ABC Family and was watched by 2.72 viewers. Plot The episode opens with paramedics loading Ezra into an ambulance. Noel is being questioned by the police. Noel claims that he heard the gunshot and ran to the rooftop and found Ezra shot. Emily, Spencer and Hanna hold Aria back since they can do nothing to help Ezra and if Aria gets too close, she'll be spending the night at the police station answering questions. Afraid of being seen on the street, Alison watches from the balcony above, where she notices someone in a black hoodie lying on top of the ambulance as it drives away. At the hospital, Ezra is taken into surgery, while someone in a hooded figure watches on. Back on the streets, the girls have brought a burner phone and pepper spray. Emily is afraid that \\"A\\" will try to hurt Alison if they execute the plan they have come up with to keep 'A' away from Ezra. But Alison wants to go ahead with their plain since Ezra saved their lives and he is the only one who knows who ‘A’ is. Aria tells Emily that everything will finally over when Ezra pulls through and tells them who \\"A\\" is, but Emily is skeptical. Hanna calls the police with the burner phone, telling them that Ezra’a shooting wasn’t a random thing and he needs protection. With the first step of their plan executed, the girls split up with Aria and Alison heading one way and Spencer, Hanna and Emily heading in another. Hanna hands A's gun over to Aria as they leave. Emily is worried about Alison but Spencer and Hanna try to convince her that Alison has been hiding from ‘A’ in plain sight for the past 2 years and can take care of herself. At the Hastings house, Veronica is on the phone with Ashley. She asks Ashley to call if she hears from Hanna and assures her that they’ll do the same. Melissa is shocked that Spencer knew all this time that Alison is alive. Veronica wants to believe that Spencer only found about Alison, a month ago as claimed by the photo CeCe showed Holbrook since it was around that time that Spencer's erratic behavior started. Melissa blames Alison for all the things that have gone wrong in Spencer's life but Veronica wants to reserve judgment since they have no idea what Alison's been through. Melissa thinks that Alison is a “time bomb” but it's everything around her that explodes and everyone around her ends up getting hurt. Melissa can't believe Alison would let her friends and family think that she was dead. Melissa wants to tell Veronica something, but before she can, the police arrive at their front door. Exiting the subway, Aria is confused about how Ezra found them. Alison tells Aria she thinks Ezra was following 'A', and 'A' was following the Liars. Alison tells her that the only reason Ezra was looking for Alison was to win back Aria, but Aria doesn’t want to talk about him since he may not even be alive. Holbrook tells the Hastings that CeCe escaped custody. Holbrook thinks that since CeCe knows Alison is alive and the girls' location, Spencer could be in danger. He asks the family if there's anything else he should know. Melissa almost opens her mouth to say something but is stopped by Peter. He says there is nothing else that they have to say. Mona is at The Brew watching a news report saying that authorities are searching for the girls including Alison who was thought to be dead. Suddenly someone arrives and she says to them that Alison being alive changes everything. Someone dressed in black and wearing a doctor's coat tries to make their way to Ezra's operation theatre but cops show up there and the person turns around and leaves. Spencer, Emily and Hanna arrive at the hospital and spot the same hooded person. They head to the waiting room and sit down, pretending to read magazines. Aria and Alison also enter the hospital and rush to a nurse's station, asking about Ezra. The person in the black hoodie is watching Spencer, Emily and Hanna in the waiting room. Suddenly, over the PA system, Alison is asked to report to the emergency room. The hooded person sends a group text reading: \\"It's happening. Follow the leader.\\" Aria tells Alison to leave. The hooded figure goes into an elevator to pursue Alison and Emily, Spencer and Hanna follow. They watch on as the elevator closes with the hooded person in it and take the stairs. Alison leaves via the emergency exit. The hooded person follows Alison through the streets of New York to a playground where Alison hides herself, when suddenly from behind the hooded figure appears saying, “Want to play?” Spencer, Emily and Hanna show up, thinking that they’ve outsmarted ‘A’ and Alison pepper sprays the person. But suddenly dozens of other hooded people wearing masks arrive and start circling the four girls. The arrival of a passing police car chases them off. Meanwhile, Aria is alone at the hospital, waiting for Ezra's surgery to get completed. Aria overhears the doctor call Ezra's mother and tells her that the bullet has been removed and that he survived surgery. Back in Rosewood, Mona is on the phone with someone, telling them to stay on top of this and that they are mobilizing. She gets off the phone and tells someone that the girls are not in Philadelphia, but in New York. The person turns out to be Lucas. Lucas says that there were supposed to be more people here and Mona assures him they’re coming. At the Hastings residence, Melissa says to her father that she needs to tell Holbrook the truth, thinking that if Spencer knew the truth she would have a reason to come back home. Peter tells her that Veronica must never know what Melissa told Peter. Holbrook gets a call from the NYPD, telling him about Ezra's shooting. Holbrook jumps online and starts looking at Ezra's records. Aria is on the phone and updates the girls on Ezra. Aria says that since his mother's in Sydney and she's the only one there for him. The girls offer to come to the hospital but Aria thinks that the five of them together would look weird. Emily thinks Alison is the target now if ‘A’ can't get to Ezra. They need a place to stay safe for the night as Ezra won't wake up for hours and so Alison takes the girls to the Fitzgerald Theater. In a flashback, Alison recalls the first time she visited the theater with Ezra. Ezra claimed that a friend of the family worked at the theater and so they got to come there after hours. Alison talks about it must feel to stand there on the stage and be loved by so many people. She thinks that she can be an actress, to which Ezra replies that she already is since she narrates all her made-up stories which such conviction that it almost seems like she herself believes them. Just then, a janitor calls him Mr. Fitzgerald which is when Alison realized Ezra is rich. According to Alison, the theater doesn't open until noon the next day and so they should be safe there. They go to the concession stand to eat something since Spencer is hungry. Hanna, Spencer and Emily start talking about a TV show they are obsessed about, making Alison feel left out. Alison excuses herself to call a few friends and tell them she's okay since they’ve risked a lot to help her. Hanna follows Alison to try and listen to her call. Shana arrives at the hospital waiting room. She tells Aria that Alison sent her there to make sure Aria was okay, but Aria doesn't like it and thinks she doesn’t need someone to watch her. Shana is determined to stay. Later that night as Alison is asleep, Spencer thinks that Alison's already shutting them out again, but Emily says that if they were the ones who helped her, they’d want Alison to call them. Spencer thinks that they are the ones who risked a lot to help Alison. The girls then talk about the potential of having a life without \\"A\\". Hanna says that she wouldn’t mind taking up a sport, like field hockey. Spencer says that all she cared about was winning before and now all she wants is to be happy. Back at the hospital, Aria has fallen asleep. Shana picks up Aria's jacket, drapes it over her and walks away. Later, as the four girls are asleep, somebody enters the theater. A gloved hand is placed over Alison's mouth. It turns out to be CeCe. Ali is surprised that CeCe found her. CeCe tells Alison that they don’t just look alike, they think alike as well. Alison thinks that CeCe took a big risk coming to New York. CeCe says that she didn’t have a choice since she needs Alison's help. Meanwhile, at the Rosewood police station, Holbrook is researching Ezra and finds out that Ezra is actually a Fitzgerald. Alison and CeCe are at a diner, meeting up with Noel. Noel hands over to CeCe Alison's fake passport and ticket along with some money. Alison is upset because this might be the last time she sees CeCe. CeCe assures her that they’ll find each other again and they hug. CeCe thanks her and leaves. Aria wakes up and is told Ezra is in recovery. She finds Shana standing at his bedside. Ezra starts to wake, but his vitals plummet when she sees Shana. As doctors rush in to stabilize him, Shana sneaks out. Alison returns to the theater and finds Emily awake. Alison tells her that there are some things she doesn't need to know about but Emily isn't satisfied. Alison leads Emily away from the other girls. Mona addresses a group of people that includes Paige. The group has one thing in common: Alison mistreated them. Paige tells Mona that she's not scared of Alison anymore and that they are not what Alison used to call them. Mona retorts that Alison isn’t even back yet and she found a way to break up Paige and Emily. Paige tries to leave but Mona warns her that she can't protect Paige if she's not a part of this. As Paige opens the door, Melissa walks in, seemingly in charge of the operation, prompting Paige to stay. Away from the other girls, Alison tells Emily that Ezra was paying CeCe for information. CeCe was never redcoat and in fact dressed as red coat, in Ravenswood, to distract ‘A’ so that Alison could turn off the saw and save Emily's life. Alison says that she can’t share this with the other girls since CeCe killed a cop (Wilden) for her and if CeCe is caught boarding the plane, Alison will be an accessory as its Alison's face on the passport. Now that Emily knows about it, she's an accessory too. Suddenly, Hanna and Spencer walk in, saying that they can’t hear Aria on the phone. Alison says that Aria should call the houseline. Holbrook finds the Fitzgerald Theater website online. He calls the number for the theater and Alison answers, thinking its Aria. She hangs up when Holbrook recognizes her voice. Holbrook calls the NYPD and advises them to send an officer to the Fitzgerald Theater. Aria tries to call the girls but they're now too scared to answer the phone. Seeing the cop in Ezra's room leave, Aria returns to Ezra's side and takes his hand. He whispers something into her ear and she rushes out of his hospital room. Spencer and Hanna suggest that since Ezra is unable to tell them who ‘A’ is, Alison should use the passport and ticket that Noel gave her and leave. Alison admits that she gave them away to somebody who needed it more than her. Hanna and Spencer are furious that Alison is keeping secrets again and think no one needs to get out of the country more than Alison. The girls realize they need to leave and rush to the stage to gather their stuff. Suddenly the lights go off. When the lights come back on, Shana arrives holding a gun. Shana admits that she was the one who set fire to the lodge and locked them in, but Alison arrived late, foiling her plan. Shana says she found out who Alison really was when she was sent to Rosewood, by Alison, to ask questions. Shana was shocked by what she found out about Alison from the people she had hurt and that even Jessica was afraid of Alison. The girls tell her that she's sick, like Mona, but they can get her help. Shana says this is not a game to her and she's there for justice for what Alison had done to Jenna, whom she is in love with. Alison tries to convince her that Jenna is using her, but Shana tells her that that's what Alison does. She tells them that Jenna doesn’t even know Shana's here. Aria sneaks up behind Shana and ends up knocking her down into the orchestra pit. Blood pools from her head- Shauna's dead. The girls try to assure Aria that she did what she had to do. They all believe it's finally over. Spencer calls the police to report an accident. Meanwhile, CeCe boards the plane to Paris using Alison's passport and ticket with the name Vivian Darkbloom. In the last scene of the episode, three police officers arrive at the Theater and discover Shana's body.

Yeltsin ran as an independent candidate. His runningmate was People's Deputy and former soldier Alexander Rutskoy. Receiving more than 50% of the vote in the first round of the election, the Yeltsin-Rutskoy ticket won the election with an overwhelming margin over their closest competitors, the Ryzhkov-Gromov ticket. Thus Boris Yeltsin and Alexander Rutskoy were elected 1st President of Russia and 1st Vice President of Russia respectively. Background Yeltsin during the March 1991 referendum, campaigning in support of establishing a presidency On March 17, 1991, the all-Russian referendum on the introduction of the post of President of Russia was held. More than 70% of citizens voted for the introduction of the post of President, elected by direct vote. On 24 April 1991 the Supreme Council of Russia adopted the law \\"On the President of the RSFSR\\". Boris Yeltsin served as Chairman of the Supreme Soviet and was the head of the Russian SFSR. He had had strong favorability. Heading into the election, he was the most popular candidate. He was widely viewed to be the only candidate with a real chance to become President.смел, напорист, гоним... 25 лет назад Борис Ельцин был избран первым президентом РоссииКампания «несгибаемого Бориса» The alliances which would form the Democratic Russia apparatus which supported Yeltsin's candidacy, had been forged prior to his presidential candidacy, originally working in support of Yeltsin's successful push to create an office of the presidency. Campaign strategy The leader of the RSFSR, Yeltsin essentially campaigned as an incumbent. Having a vast lead, Yeltsin opted to avoid engaging his opponents. Yeltsin's support came not only from a liberal democratic base, but also from a broad coalition of a variety of social groups. Nevertheless, his core support came from a base which favored radical reforms. His greatest support was found in Russia's cities. He also found strong support among those who were most disadvantaged under the Soviet system. While the campaign period was very brief, both Yeltsin and Rutskoy still traveled to many regions of Russia and held meetings with voters. Yeltsin's campaign and its backers decided to conduct a low-key campaign. Rather than heightening emotions of voters, they sought to instead calm them. A key reason behind the decision to opt for a low key campaign was a desire to avoid fatigue among voters. For instance, when Democratic Russia held rallies attended by several hundred thousand supporters each on May 20 and June 10 in Moscow's Manezh Square, rather than riling voters up about key issues, those speaking at the rallies spoke lightheartedly and expressed their confidence in Yeltsin's chances of winning the election. Steering largely away from issues, only occasional criticisms of Yeltsin's opponents and of the communist order were delivered at these events. Organizers Yeltsin's campaign had decided that they wait until June before fully ramping up their efforts. They did this in the belief that Russians had become tired of politics, and that it would be off putting to overly-campaign. With Yeltsin having a strong lead, they deemed it unnecessary to conduct much beyond a \\"minimal campaign\\". Yeltsin made an effort to avoided creating optics of a direct association with the more extremist elements of the democratic movement. He wanted to avoid repulsing voters. On May 23 Yeltsin told Izvestia that he desired for the democrats to be less combative in their attacks on the center. Rather than employing the sorts of frenzied rhetoric that his opponents were using, Yeltsin instead opted to act the part of a measured statesman during the campaign period. This was intended solidify the perception of Yelstin as a capable leader and enhance the dynamic in which he was running as a de facto incumbent. The economic crisis and the serious antikomintern (the mood in society) influenced Yeltsin's decision to adopt a more serious tone of rhetoric. In his campaign rhetoric Yeltsin made a conscious effort to refer to his fellow citizens as rossiiany (a term referring to all the people living in Russian territory) as opposed to russkie (which, more specifically, tends to refer to ethnic Russians). As part of the democratic opposition to the communist Soviet establishment, Yeltsin benefited from the fever pitch which anti-communist tensions had reached in Russia. Yeltsin's campaign apparatus had immense access to printing resources, and, come the election, were able to flood the nation with posters and leaflets. Opponents, such as Vladimir Zhirinovsky lacked access to comparable resources. Campaigning Yeltsin was the only candidate of the democratic forces. Among the organizations that supported him were the Democratic Russia movement, the Democratic Party and the Social Democratic Party. On April 27 Democratic Russia nominated Yeltsin as their candidate. On May 3 the RSFSR Social Democratic Party nominated Yeltsin at their national conference. The Social Democratic Party also nominated Galina Starovoytova to be Yeltsin's running mate if he were to accept their nomination. Yeltsin refused both nominations. Rather of accepting any one party's nomination, Yeltsin instead opted to run as an independent. However, while refusing their nominations, Yeltsin received support from both parties. On April 29, during a meeting in Novokuznetsk with approximately 600 miners and local officials, Yeltsin took the opportunity to issue a number of promises aimed at earning the votes of miners. On the same day, Democratic Russia organized an event in Moscow in which thousands of supporters rallied for Yeltsin and collected signatures for his registration. Democratic Russia had been hoping to also organize a Red Square rally with a Moscow trade union organization, however these plans fell apart due to the trade union objecting to some of the more radical slogans which Democratic Russia used, which called for the resignation of Gorbachev. On May 16 an explosion occurred in room being used to store the signatures being gathered for Yeltsin's candidacy at the Democratic Russia headquarters in Moscow. The Baltimore Sun called it \\"the first political bombing in the capital for more than a decade.\\" Sovetskaya Rossiya placed blame on the Libertarian (Radical) Party of the Soviet Union for perpetrating the attack, however they denied involvement. Yeltsin was officially registered as a presidential candidate on May 20. A week afterwards, he embarked on a ten-day campaign tour. He started his campaign travels with a trip to Murmansk, where he was reported to have been hounded by enthusiastic crowds waving the flag of pre-revolutionary Russia and shouting \\"We love you, Boris Nikolaevich!\\". As he had on previous trips he had made to the distant regions of the Russian Federation, Yeltsin promised the local residents that his administration would devolve enough powers to the regions to enable them to solve their problems themselves. On this tour, Yeltsin subsequently traveled to Petrozavodsk, Voronezh, Perm, Chelyabinsk, Orenberg, and Sverdlovsk (the latter being Yeltsin's hometown and a strong bastion of pro-Yeltsin support). Although Yeltsin had earlier promised to participate in debates, during the campaign he opted against it. Two days before the election more than 20,000 supporters attended an afternoon rally in Moscow's Manezh Square. At the rally, chess champion Garry Kasparov delivered a speech encouraging a large turnout in support of Yeltsin. Democratic Russia leader Nikolai Travkin confidently spoke of Yeltsin's prospects. Eduard Shevardnadze spoke in support of Yeltsin's candidacy on the eve of the election, calling his likely election a \\"step in the right direction\\". In hopes of garnering the support of religious voters, on the eve of the election Yeltsin was interviewed on RSFSR state radio by Orthodox priests Vyacheslav Polosin (who was also a deputy of the Supreme Soviet and the cofounder of the Russian Christian Democratic Movement). On the day of the election Yeltsin's campaign deployed a vast number of poll watchers to observe voting stations across the country, in order to keep an eye out for any voter fraud that the Communist Party might conduct against him. Running mate selection Yeltsin's running mate Alexander Rutskoy In May 1991, speculation grew about who Yeltsin was going to pick as his running mate. Potential candidates were Vadim Bakatin, Gennady Burbulis, Dmitri Volkogonov, Gavriil Popov, Anatoly Sobchak, Galina Starovoytova, Sergey Shakhray, and Vladimir Bukovsky. It was reported that Yeltsin had reached an agreement with Bakatin for him to serve as his running mate, but that Bakatin had backed out after being convinced by Mikhail Gorbachev to instead challenge Yeltsin for the presidency. According to Yeltsin, until the last minute he had intended to choose between his two closest associates at time, which were Ruslan Khasbulatov and Gennady Burbulis. However, he ultimately felt they lacked charisma and were too unpopular with voters. Despite their key role in his campaign effort, Yeltsin did not consult the leaders of Democratic Russia about his running mate selection. On May 18, 1991 (the last day when it was still possible for him to choose a running mate) Yeltsin selected Alexander Rutskoy as his running mate.О. Мороз ТАК КТО ЖЕ РАССТРЕЛЯЛ ПАРЛАМЕНТ? (М. Издательство \\"Олимп\\", 2007) Rutskoy was a celebrated military veteran, a People's Deputy, and the leader of the newly-formed Communists for Democracy movement. The choice of Rutskoy was unexpected to many. Most of the candidates that had been widely anticipated were from the same political camp as Yeltsin. Rutskoy had not previously been a political ally of Yeltsin's. A prominent figure in the Communist camp, Rutskoy was a former ally of Gorbachev. He was also considered to be more conservative than Gorbachev. However, he had also shown an openness to democratic reforms. Yeltsin selected Rutskoy after deciding that he wanted a runningmate that could broaden support for the ticket. He hoped that Rutskoy's inclusion on the ticket could attract some conservative (anti- reform) voters, such as moderate-leaning members of the Communist Party, members of the military, and nationalists. While an unexpected choice, Rutskoy was not an extreme choice. He was a well-regarded Hero of the Soviet Union. He carried a strong military reputation, which was important to Yeltsin. Yeltsin's strongest opponent, Nikolai Ryzhkov, had selected a military hero to serve as his running mate. Yeltsin hoped that Ryzhkov would help him to attract the many conservative Russian voters who desired stability in society. Rutskoy hoped that his inclusion on the ticket would provide a ticket balance, and allow Yeltsin to attract votes from moderate communists. Yeltsin praised Rutskoy for his ability to understand the needs of military veterans and for his creation of the \\"Communists for Democracy\\" movement. Rutskoy declared that he would continue to be a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Russia, but that he still disagreed with its leadership (particularly with Ivan Polizkov). He encouraged all who wished to see Russia's greatness restored to vote for him and Yeltsin. Soon after his selection, Rutskoy came under fire amid allegations that he had been formerly supported by chauvinistic organizations such as Pamyat' and Otechestvo, and that he had been a strong opponent of the late academician Andrei Sakharov. Rutskoy defended himself by stating that while he had been one of the founders of Otechestvo (which he argued had bee started as a patriotic association), he rejected the chauvinistic views which it had since adopted. Rutskoy also said that he only disagreed with Andrei Sakharov over Sakharov's claim that the Soviet air force had bombed its own soldiers in Afghanistan, but that he otherwise he has great respect for Sakharov. Election result Yeltsin received 58.6% of the votes in the first round of the election, while the runner-up Nikolai Ryzhkov scored 17.2%. Having received more than 50% of the votes cast, Yeltsin had won the presidency outright in the first round, negating the need for a runoff to take place. Yeltsin received his greatest level of support Sverdlovsk Oblast (84.8%). His support was also extremely strong in other regions, receiving 70% in Chechen and Ingush Republic, Perm and Chelyabinsk Oblasts and in Moscow, between 65 and 70% in Dagestan, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara Oblasts, Khanty-Mansi and Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrugs and Leningrad.Избрание Б.Н. Ельцина Президентом РСФСР He saw his lowest share of votes in the Republic of Tuva (where they took third place, with 15.25% of the vote) and also in three national regions (Altai Republic, North Ossetian Republic and Agin-Buryat Autonomous Okrug) where he was supported by less than 30% of voters. Platform While Yeltsin had outlined some policy proposals during his campaign, he kept many of his positions intentionally vague. In order to appeal to a broader array of voters, Yeltsin mostly avoided answering questions about his specific political ideology. In general, Yeltsin was seen as a democratic-minded reformist. Yeltsin's unveiled his campaign's platform at a June 1 meeting of the Democratic Russia movement. He pledged to improve Russian living conditions within a two-year timeframe. As president, Yeltsin planned to pursue greater sovereignty and overall self-governance for the RSFSR. He called for many aspects of Russia's government would be transferred from the purview of the Soviet Union to the government of the RSFSR. He intended to obtain ultimate control over finance policy in the RSFSR territory and to pursue a transfer of all RSFSR industries, including military plants, to jurisdiction of the RSFSR government jurisdiction. He intended to pursue a sovereign foreign policy. He also proposed market reforms. During his campaign, Yeltsin also pledged that his government would return all property that had been confiscated from the Russian Orthodox Church. Yeltsin stated that he believed that the Soviet Union's military needed to be unified, well- armed, and highly capable. Yeltsin's stance on keeping the Soviet Union's military unified was a reversal of his earlier stance that the RSFSR should consider forming its own army Yeltsin stated that he believed that the Soviet Union's military needed to be unified, well-armed, and highly capable (which he had adopted after the January 13 attack in Vilnius). Yeltsin criticized the poor living standards experienced by military personnel and the difficulties faced by workers in the military-industrial sector. He also opposed using the army for domestic policing. He was the only candidate to support depoliticization of the armed forces. On June 9 in Sverdlovsk, Yeltsin declared that he would make Russia's military industries fund themselves. Campaign organizations The organizations which facilitated Yeltsin's campaign had descended from organizations that had earlier been developed to support his push for the RSFSR to establish a presidency. The campaign organization consisted of two leading entities, the official campaign committee and the Democratic Russia-run national initiative group. While Yelstin officially ran as an independent candidate, the latter organization nonetheless played a critical role in his campaign operations. Structure The campaign consisted of two components, a national initiative group and an official campaign committee. In the national initiative groups's chain of command was that neighborhood and factory organizations answered to district level committees, which answered to regional public committees, which answered to the committee's logistics group. A strategy group acted independent of the logistic group's authority. In the chain of command of the official campaign committee, regional representatives answered to the central office. Regional representatives of the official campaign coordinated with regional public committees of the national initiative group. Official campaign committee Gennady Burbulis served as the chairman of the official campaign committee The chairperson of the official campaign committee was Gennady Burbulis. He directly oversaw a staff of one hundred \\"trusted persons\\". =Central office= The campaign's central office was staffed by thirty paid staff as well as approximately 200 technical specialists and volunteers. =Regional representatives= Representatives of the campaign were located in each of Russia's federal subjects. They acted as the official conduit between the official campaign and regional public committees. National initiative group (Democratic Russia) The campaign's National initiative group, run by Democratic Russia, was chaired by Aleksandr Muzykansky, who, at the time, was the Vice Chairperson of the Moscow City Soviet. Muzykansky had previously been the lead organizer of Yeltsin's campaign in the 1989 legislative election. The national initiative group was a continuation of an existing Democratic Russia apparatus which had been formed (in advance of the March 1991 referendum) to support Yeltsin's push to establish a presidency. On May 18 and 19, national, regional, and district level organizers from Democratic Russia met in Moscow with a team of five campaign experts, led by Paul Weyerich and Robert Krieble from the United States-based Committee for a Free Congress. The experts provided them with campaign advice. =Strategy group= Members of strategy group consisted of Democratic Russia's five co-chairpersons and a number of advisors. Lev Ponomar was a member, as we was one of Democratic Russia's five co-chairpersons. =Logistics group= The logistics group had between five and eight paid staff members, whose efforts were supplemented by a number of volunteer staff members. The logistics group commanded field operations as the direct superior to the regional public committees. Regional public committees Regional public committees were located in each of Russia's federal subjects, overseeing the campaign's field operations in each subject. They were each run either by regional chapters of Democratic Russia, by affiliated political parties, or by both. The regional public committees were the key component of the campaign's operations, conducting a bulk of the work. Neither the regional public committees nor their subordinate units (district level committees, neighborhood and factory organizations) conducted canvassing. The campaign had opted against canvassing because, in many regions, they lacked enough volunteers to conduct impactful canvassing efforts. They also decided against it because they believed that, in the regions where they would be able to find enough volunteers, too many volunteers would be extremist democrats. They feared that such volunteers would be harmful if they represented the campaign to voters. The campaign instead relied on using advertising mail to distribute campaign literature to voters, often by having volunteers anonymously drop leaflets into mailboxes. =District level committees= District level committees were sub-regional committees tasked with overseeing campaign efforts in a number of districts. They were each run either by regional chapters of Democratic Russia, by affiliated political parties, or by both. =Neighborhood and factory organizations= Neighborhood and factory organizations were, respectively, local organizations dedicated to overseeing field operations and individual neighborhoods or efforts targeting the workforce in individual factories. They were run by local volunteers alongside either regional chapters of Democratic Russia, affiliated political parties, or by both.

Yeltsin was ultimately reelected, despite having originally been greatly expected to lose the election due to an immensely low level of public support prior to the official launch of his campaign. Background Yelstin's approval had tanked after he had introduced significant reforms meant to push Russia towards a market-based economy. He had eliminated the majority of Soviet-era price controls, privatized a large number of significant state assets, permitted the ownership of private property, welcomed free-market principles, and additionally allowed for a stock exchange to be established and for commodities exchanges and private banks to be created. While some Russians (largely oligarchs) thrived under his reforms, many others faced significant hardships as a result of them. A significant portion of the Russian populace had faced increased poverty under his leadership. Additionally, crime rates had significantly increased during his presidency. Yeltsin had originally risen to power on a populist message of anticorruption and an opponent of Moscow's establishment politics. A political maverick, he was cast-out by the Soviet political establishment. He found a base of support among liberal and pro-western democratic movements. In 1990, those movements united to form the Democratic Russia. This group held a base of power primarily in Moscow, Saint Petersburg, and the Urals. This political alliance brought him into power in June 1991, and helped him to resist a coup attempt in August 1991. The alliance formed the base of Russia's first noncommunist government. However, this alliance never merged into a single political organization. Yeltsin never officially joined the front, intending to maintain a level of separation between himself and partisan politics. Thus, it consequentially splintered, leaving him without a unified base of support. Under Yeltsin's leadership, Russia faced the stigma of being a fallen international superpower. Russia encountered a massive amount of corruption and lawlessness. Russia's economy also faced a decline in industrial production and the Russian populace's qualify of life and life expectancy declined. As president, Yeltsin had allowed for a far more free media to exist than his Soviet predecessors had. In doing so, he not only allowed Russians to enjoy Western pop-culture, but he also permitted open criticism of his own leadership to be published by the press. Yeltsin promised in May 1992 that he would \\"absolutely\\" not seek a second term. However, observers doubted the authenticity of this declaration. No Kremlin leader in 1,000 years had voluntarily stepped aside to make way for a successor. ;1993 White House following the 1993 constitutional crisis Following the 1993 Russian constitutional crisis, the Yeltsin government adopted a more nationalist and authoritarian agenda than they had previously championed. Yeltsin saw a favorable result in the 1993 constitutional referendum vote. However, at the same time as the constitutional referendum, the pro-Yeltsin and pro-reform Russia's Choice party fared disastrously in the legislative elections. Russia's Choice might have seen their prospects harmed by Yeltsin's own refusal to officially align himself with or endorse the party. A reason for Yeltsin's refusal to voice his support of the party might have been a desire of Yeltsin's to continue to separate himself from partisan politics,http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/RP96-70/RP96-70.pdf while another reason might have been tension between Yeltsin and key members of the Russia's Choice party such as Yegor Gaidar and Boris Fyodorov. Nevertheless, the party had been expected to garner as much as a 40% plurality of the vote. However, the party instead garnered merely 15.5% of the votes, placing behind Vladimir Zhirinovsky's Liberal Democratic Party, which received 22.9% of the vote. Zhirinovsky had successfully appealed to a chunk of the Russian electorate that had grown tired of both the communist leadership of the past and the current \\"democratic\\" leadership under Yeltsin. Zhirinovsky had espoused a protofascist views and \\"law-and-order\\" rhetoric laced with racist undertones. Combined, the core reformist (pro-Yeltsin) parties, including the Russia's Choice and Party of Russian Unity and Accord, received a mere 27.5% of the vote, whilst the core opposition parties received 43.3%. The underperformance of the pro-Yeltsin forces in the 1993 legislative election alarmed some in Yelstin's camp of an urgent need for Yeltsin to revive his faltering public image. ;1994 Over the course of 1994, Yeltsin became more and more separated from core reformist politicians and organizations. At the same time, Yeltsin was also becoming more and more separated from the coalition government and its leader, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. Instead, Yeltsin increasingly relied on the advice of First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets and his own bodyguard and confidant Alexander Korzhakov. Soskovets had been shaping Yeltsin's campaign strategy. ;1995 Our Home Russia fared poorly in the 1995 legislative election The result 1995 legislative election was not better for Yeltsin. Core reformist (pro- Yeltsin) parties performed marginally worse than 1993, receiving a combined 25.5% of the vote. Core opposition parties garnered 42.5% of the vote. The opposition Communist Party gained power in the 1995 legislative election. Its leader, Gennady Zyuganov, had a strong grassroots organization, especially in the rural areas and small towns. Zyuganov had appealed effectively to nostalgia for an era of Soviet prestige on the international stage and socialist domestic order. It was already clear at this time that Zyuganov was going to challenge Yeltsin for the presidency the following year. In the 1995 legislative elections, Zhirinovsky's Liberal Democratic Party placed second with 11.18% of the vote. Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin's centrist, non- reformist, party Our Home – Russia won 10.13%, placing third. The result of the 1995 legislative elections seemed to further indicate that support for Yeltsin's reformists was indeed in political decline. The largest reformist party at the time, Grigory Yavlinsky's Yabloko won only 6.9% of the vote. The next-largest reformist party, Yegor Gaidar's Democratic Choice of Russia, won a paltry 3.9%. Yeltsin's advisers viewed this as evidence that it would be disastrous for Yeltsin to campaign as a reformist/democrat. Indeed, polling in December placed Yeltsin behind both Zyuganov and Zhirinovsky. Campaign strategies Soskovets strategy Yeltsin's original, abandoned, campaign strategy had been devised by Oleg Soskovets in response to the defeat of pro- Yeltsin parties in the 1993 and 1995 legislative elections. Soskovets decided that for Yeltsin to win in 1996, he would need to adopt some of Zhirinovsky's style of rhetoric. Soskovets worked alongside others, such as Alexander Korzhakov, to devise a strategy. According to their strategy, Yelstin would need to position himself as an intermediate between the reformers and the Zhirinovsky-style protofascists by adopting the platforms of both. Yeltsin initially obliged, and took action to pivot and adjust his image accordingly. Abandonment of Soskovets strategy In late-January 1996, members of Yeltsin's inner-circle began to inform him that they were worried that Soskovets' strategy was a losing strategy. At the same time, Soskovets' standing with Yeltsin was severely harmed after he failed to complete the campaign's signature drive by the deadline that Yeltsin had assigned him. By February, Yeltsin had begun to abandon Soskovets' advice. At this time, several shadow campaigns were hard at work to support Yeltsin's candidacy, and were developing alternative campaign strategies for Yeltsin to adopt. By early February, Sergei Filatov (a former member of Yeltsin's government) had been appointed as the interim head of the campaign headquarters. Filatov was also tasked with laying the groundwork for Yeltsin's official campaign committee. Filatov's appointment consequentially supplanted much of Soskovets' authority within the campaign. On March 23, in a meeting with Anatoly Chubais and members of Semibankirschina that polling showed him to be headed towards a defeat. Panic stuck Yeltsin's inner circle after their meeting with the Semisbankirschina made it clear to them that the opinion polls indicated that Yeltsin could not win. Some members of the inner-circle, such as Alexander Korzhakov, urged Yeltsin to cancel or postpone the election in order to prevent a Communist victory.Россия Ельцина // The Wall Street Journal, 24 апреля 2007 Others, such as Yegor Gaidar, urged Yeltsin to forgo seeking a second term, so that they could instead run a reform-minded candidate that would capable of winning the election. Instead of abandoning his candidacy, Yeltsin reorganized his campaign organization. Yeltsin's own daughter Tatyana Dyachenko was instrumental in convincing him to replace Soskovets as his campaign head. While Yelstin distrusted his campaign advisors, he placed great trust in the advice of his daughter. On March 23, day after the meeting with the Semibankirschina team, Yeltsin fired Soskovets, officially ending the Soskovets campaign strategy. Adoption of a new campaign strategy The campaign's revised strategy became more clear after liberal figures solidified their control of the campaigns central leadership. They rejected the premise of the earlier Soskovets campaign strategy, believing that trying to appeal towards communists and fascists would be a losing strategy. Instead, they formed an entirely new strategy for his campaign. Russia lacked a strong party system, thus partisan divides were less a factor for campaigns than they were in democracies with more developed party systems, such as France, the United Kingdom and the United States. In both the 1993 and 1995 parliamentary elections, half of Russia's parliamentary seats were decided by voting in single-mandate districts. However, the other half was determined by a national system of proportional representation. Proportional representation encouraged the existence of a plethora of political parties and little incentive for party consolidation. In 1993, thirteen separate parties contested in legislative elections. In 1995, forty-three different parties did. This was seen by the campaign's new leadership as being problematic to Yeltsin's candidacy. They believed that in order to win he would need to convince voters that he was the lesser evil, which he would be unable to effectively do without first convincing voters that they had only two options. Essentially, the strategy was to manufacture a public perception that there existed a political duopoly consisting of Yeltsin and Zyuganov's Communist Party. They would instill such a perception in spite of the fact that Russia had a multi- party system. Under their new strategy, the campaign would work to recast Yeltsin as an individual single-handedly fighting to stave off communist control. The campaign framed a narrative that portrayed Yeltsin as Russia's best hope for stability. Under their new strategy, the campaign would also work to shift the narrative of the election into a referendum on whether voters wanted to return to their communist past (with Zyuganov), or continue with reforms (with Yeltsin). Rather than painting a new detailed vision for the direction in which he would take the nation during his second term, Yeltsin would provide voters assurances that the economic payoff of his reforms was around the corner, as well as stoke fears that Russia's economic situation would only worsen under communist leadership. The decision to frame the election as a referendum on whether Russia should move forward towards a market economy or move backwards towards communism would prove to be one of the more important decisions that contributed the campaign's ultimate victory. Also important to the campaign's new strategy was to highlight the left's radical views and to portray Zyuganov as a government bureaucrat with no practical leadership experience. Under their new strategy, the campaign campaign sought to replicate factors that had previously contributed to his victories in the 1991 presidential election and the 1993 referendums. One factor that it sought to replicate was the public's perception of his leadership. In 1991, Yeltsin had been widely seen as a vigorous leader. This was no longer the case. Thus, Yeltsin took an active approach to campaigning in order to project a revival of vigor. Another factor was for Yeltsin to highlight the divide between the moderate and radical sides of the left-wing and to capitalize off of the resulting political polarization. Yet another factor he replicated was the allocation of funds to popular causes, something he had also done in advance of the 1991 election and 1994 referendum. He also repeated tactics used in 1991 and 1993 by firing unpopular officials, slowing down the pace of economic reforms (a plurality of Russians felt that the reforms needed to be more gradual), and promising to pivot a number policies in the direction favored by the public. Another factor was to create an overwhelmingly pro-Yelstin media bias, similar to the one that Yeltsin had benefited from in the leadup to the 1993 referendums. Campaigning in first round Early developments Anatoly Sobchak, then Mayor of St. Petersburg, was considered to run as a candidate instead of Yeltsin Many predicted that Russia would succumb to the same trend as many other post- Soviet transition democracies, where nationalist politicians unseated incumbent leaders. Before Yelstin announced his intention to seek a second term, there was speculation that he would retire from politics due to his ailing health and the growing disapproval of his performance. At the time Yeltsin was recuperating from a series of heart attacks. Despite some efforts to revive the public's perception, Yeltsin still possessed a strongly negative image, with both domestic and international observers taking note his occasionally erratic behavior. Additionally, amid the aforementioned economic decline, Yeltsin encountered poor optics by enjoying the benefits of power, enjoying luxuries he himself had once criticized Soviet leaders for, such as chauffeured limos. Yeltsin's popularity came close to zero. According to the former Kremlin Chief of Staff Sergey Filatov, Yeltsin initially did not plan to participate in the elections, but with the success of the Communist party in the legislative elections, he changed this decision.Второй, понимаешь«Ельцин не хотел идти на второй срок» Former Yeltsin adviser Sergey Stankevich claimed that then Mayor of St. Petersburg Anatoly Sobchak was considered as a candidate for the presidency instead of Yeltsin, as Sobchak had all the necessary resources and was seen to have a chance of winning. However, at the end of 1995 Sobchak finally abandoned this idea, and Yeltsin still decided to seek re-election.«Ельцин был великий интуитивист»Как пресса избирала президента In January, Yeltsin distributed an internal memo, which was soon leaked in the press. The memo urged his government to undertake radical measures to ensure he would retain power. One of the suggested actions was to dismiss regional governors that did not provide a sufficient level of support to Our Home – Russia during the 1995 legislative elections. Other actions suggested in the memo were to channel government money into his election campaign, use state-run media to bolster his candidacy, cut funding to state-owned regional newspapers that supported opposition candidates, and to ensure that positions in the Central Election Commission were occupied by individuals favoring Yeltsin. On January 22, Yeltsin stated that he would announce the final decision on whether he was going to run sometime between February 13 and 15. Yeltsin commented, By this time, it was widely anticipated that, despite his unpopularity, Yeltsin was going to seek reelection. The days leading up to the announcement were characterized by a number of figures with connections to Yeltsin signaling whether or not they would support his reelection campaign. For instance, on February 5, Vyacheslav Kostikov, Yeltsin's former spokesman, indicated his opposition to Yeltsin's candidacy by delivering a crass and harshly-worded rebuke of the President. On February 8, Prime Minister Chernomyrdin denied long-standing rumors that he would seek presidency himself, declaring that Yeltsin had his, \\"complete and unconditional support.\\" Announcement of candidacy Yeltsin's campaign announcement was held in the Youth Palace Yeltsin declared his candidacy in his native Yekaterinburg On February 15, 1996, Yeltsin officially declared his intentions to seek a second term in a speech delivered at the Youth Palace in his native Yekaterinburg.Yeltsin: A Life by Timothy J. Colton While delivering his announcement, Yeltsin's voice was uncharacteristically hoarse. Yeltsin's announcement tried to portray a stark contrast between himself and Zyuganov. In his announcement Yeltsin declared, Yeltsin proclaimed in his speech, \\"the people want me to run a second time.\\" Despite Yeltsin making this remark insisting that the Russian public desired to see him run for reelection, polling indicated immense disinterest in his candidacy. On the day that he announced his candidacy, the majority of major polls showed him to be either in fourth or fifth place. Most political observers had already disregarded his prospects. Polling showed him to possess an approval rating of 6%. Joseph Stalin was found to be polling more favorably, scoring both lower negatives and higher positives than Yeltsin. Polling also found that the majority of Russians believed that Yeltsin was to blame for wrecking the country's economy. The campaign faced the challenge of convincing voters that despite bleak circumstances under his incumbency, Russia would fare better under Yeltsin's continued leadership.CNN Interactive: Pivotal Elections: Russian Elections; Candidates: Boris Yeltsin (1996) Many observers saw Yeltsin as an unpopular underdog. There were some observers who believed that Yeltsin still could be able to utilize his reputable political instincts combined with the immense patronage and power belonging to the presidency in order to pull off an upset victory. However, most saw his prospects of winning a fair election as incredibly dim. Yegor Gaidar was even quoted as saying, \\"No matter how you arrange the possible coalitions, it is hard to imagine that the president will win.\\" Winter 1996 By the virtue of Yeltsin's incumbency, his campaign effort was given access to a plethora of resources that no other campaign had. This meant that the advantage of his incumbency immense. While he was, on one hand, burdened by the failures of his incumbency, he was also provided substantial utilities by virtue his position as the head of the Russian government.https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1996/07/22/the-war-for-the- kremlin Yeltsin's campaign had access to the resources of agencies such as the FSB the FAPSI. Korzhakov's own analytic center and regional heads of administration who Korzhakov helped to appoint were willing to assist the campaign. The campaign used these resources for intelligence gathering and monitoring campaign spending, however they otherwise benefited only marginally from them. However, Yeltsin found other means of using his incumbency as a tool for his campaign. Being an incumbent, he could demonstrate his willingness to fulfill promises he was making on the campaign trail. In March he doubled a large number of pensions. This received flak from his opponents, who accused him of essentially buying votes, however, Yeltsin's team argued that he was simply doing his job as President.http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9604/22/russia.elex/index.html In early March, Yeltsin decreed that 40 million landowners in Russia would have the right to buy and sell property. This move made land a tradable commodity in Russia for the first time since 1917. Yeltsin hoped that this would benefit peasants and provide them a reason to embrace reforms, thus undermining their support for the communists. On March 15, the Communist Party, which constituted the largest faction in the State Duma, moved to pass a (largely symbolic) non-binding resolution denouncing the Dissolution of the Soviet Union. This played right into Yeltsin's hands. Allegedly, Yeltsin's aides had they laid the groundwork for the vote by giving nationalists in the Duma the go-ahead to vote with the Communists and by coordinating the proceedings so that only Yeltsin's least popular allies in parliament speak out against the resolution. When it passed, Yeltsin attacked the Communists by alleging that if one is to claim that the Soviet breakup was illegal, then Russia itself was an illegitimate state. This, seemingly inconsequential, vote now positioned Zyuganov as an apparent extremist. Polling ultimately showed that less than a third of Russian's approved of the resolution. The Communists proved unable to effectively respond to this development. Soon after this, Yeltsin's own poll numbers began to improve. On March 24, Chernomydrin announced that Our Home is Russia would back Yeltsin's candidacy. He also announced his intention to form a broad coalition of parties to back Yeltsin's campaign. On March 27, 1996, Yeltsin benefited from International Monetary Fund director Michel Camdessus' approval of a $10.2 billion loan for Russia.https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/23/world/russia-and-imf-agree-on-a- loan-for-10.2-billion.html Spring 1996 Throughout the Winter of 1996, Soskovets' strategy was losing traction. At the start of Spring, however, the strategy was entirely abandoned when Yeltsin fired Soskovets as his campaign manager. As was detailed previously, new campaign leadership was added to the campaign, and a new strategy was being adopted. Yeltsin's candidacy was officially filed on April 3. That same day, Democratic Russia leaders Lev Ponomaryov and Gleb Yakunin gave Yeltsin their personal endorsements, and encouraged members of their party to follow their lead. Boris Yeltsin at his campaign's first official rally on April 4 in Belgorod. Belgorod was seen as a communist stronghold. In the 1995 legislative election, 35% of its electorate had voted for the Communist Party in its party list vote, and they had elected in their single-district vote Nikolai Ryzhkov (Yeltsin's closest opponent in the 1991 presidential election). Immediately after officially filing his candidacy, Yeltsin launched his first campaign tour. He decided to travel to southern Russia's agricultural region, home to the Red Belt (where the Communists were particularly strong). He began his travels with a trip to the city of Belgorod. On his visit, Yeltsin was greeted with unexpectedly warm reception. Thereafter, the Yeltsin campaign staff arranged an exhaustive travel schedule for the president and Yelstin campaigned vigorously, maintaining a high media profile. Yeltsin traveled around the country and visited factories, met with voters, and faced hecklers.Вторая кампания Бориса Ельцина - 1996§1. Выборы Президента РФ в 1996 году. «Семья»: победа любой ценой As an advantage of his incumbency, Yeltsin had the liberty of traveling on the presidential jet. In contrast, Zyuganov had to travel by commercial flights. For his second campaign trip after being registered as a candidate Yeltsin traveled to Krasnodar on April 16. In Krasnodar Yeltsin announced new state handouts, promised veterans that he would increase their pension 125% within a month, pledged greater benefits for the Cossacks, declared building relations with the Commonwealth of Independent States to be Russia's most important foreign policy concern, and announced his intention to sign decrees stimulating the economic development of Krasnodar Krai and Russia's agro- industrial complex. Yeltsin also declared that Russia's Black Sea Fleet, partly based in Krasnodar Krai, to be a, \\"indispensable element of Russian strategic security.\\" Many of Yeltsin's early stump speeches had a forward- looking tone, promising a better future for all Russians, and seeking to reposition him as a unifying force in Russian politics. In an April speech Yeltsin said, Yeltsin worked diligently to convince Russian voters that he would be able to make it to the second round of the election and defeat Zyuganov. He was publicly dismissive of suggestions that a third force might coalesce.The 1996 Russian presidential election / Jerry F. Hough, Evelyn Davidheiser, Susan Goodrich Lehmann. Brookings occasional papers. In April, for the first time, a number of polls were showing Yeltsin leading Zyuganov. Polls also showed that Yeltsin's support was higher amongst younger, urban, and higher-income Russians, while Zyuganov's support was higher amongst older, poorer, and rural voters. Polling showed signs that Yeltsin had likely benefited some from his recent announcement of plans to peacefully end the conflict in Chechnya. Yeltsin also was benefiting from the Communist Party running a relatively poor campaign. The Communists had been rather unsuccessful in their marketing of Zyuganov's candidacy, failing to create appealing messaging. During the nation's Victory Day Celebration, Yeltsin gave an address to crowds in Red Square from atop Lenin's Tomb. He praised the Russian people, Russian soldiers, and the Allies (unlike Zyuganov, who failed to acknowledge the allied forces in the speech he delivered across town). After delivering his speech, Yeltsin broke with tradition and became the first Russian leader in 51 years to leave Moscow during the Victory Day celebration. Following a brief meeting with veterans in Gorky Park, he flew to Volgograd (Stalingrad), the site of some of the fiercest fighting during the war. Yeltsin said that, although the Volgograd region had consistently voted Communist in past elections, he felt morally obligated to visit the site due to its importance. Upon arriving in Volgograd, Yeltsin was reportedly greeted by crowds carrying signs saying \\"We love you\\" and \\"Yeltsin is a democrat.\\"Victory Day Celebration: From atop Lenin's tomb, President Yeltsin addressed the crowds in Red Square celebrating the 51st anniversary of the end of World War II. Yeltsin praised the Russian people, Russian soldiers, and unlike his Communist rival speaking across town, the Allies. Yeltsin also called attention the recently reinstated red flag labeling it \\"a living link between the generations.\\" He then became the first Russian leader in 51 years to leave Moscow during the Victory Day celebration. After meeting briefly with veterans in Gorky Park, Yeltsin flew to Volgograd (Stalingrad), site of some of the fiercest fighting during the war. Yeltsin explained, although the region has consistently voted Communist in recent elections, he felt morally obligated to visit a site of such importance. According to the government's ITAR-TASS press agency, crowds greeted Yeltsin carrying signs saying \\"We love you\\" and \\"Yeltsin is a democrat.\\" Yelstin campaigning on May 7 In early May, Yeltsin refused Zyuganov's challenge to hold a debate, saying, He went on to say, he did not have time to debate all of the ten candidates, and it would not be fair to debate just one. Over the Victory Day (May 9th) weekend, Yeltsin's campaign began a heavy advertising campaign. This was in violation of election laws, which mandated that candidates could not run television, billboard, or radio advertisements earlier than March 15. The advertisements were created for the campaign by the Russian advertising firm Video International. The advertisements starred veterans, and were commissioned by the Igor Malashenko (who was in charge of the campaign's image management and television advertising) to serve as the first step of an effort to Yeltsin's image among older voters. In May, Yeltsin's campaign saw a boost when The World Bank provided Russia a loan. Yeltsin's campaign got a boost from the announcement of a $10 billion loan to the Russian government from the International Monetary Fund. Yeltsin used trillions of rubles from the IMF loans to begin repaying government debt to state employees. At the May 17 CIS Summit in Moscow, leaders of the other nations that formerly composed the Soviet Union offered their collective endorsement of Yeltsin's candidacy. Yeltsin's campaign received a boost when on May 27, he and acting Chechen President Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev signed a cease-fire. Following the signing ceremony, Yeltsin boarded a plane and immediately embarked on a surprise six- hour trip to Chechnya, where he visited soldiers and declared victory. This fulfilled a promise that Yeltsin had made that he would personally visit war- torn Chechnya before the day of the election. On May 31, Yeltsin unveiled his official campaign platform in the city of Perm. The choice of location made headlines, as Perm was widely seen to favor the Communist Party. Perm was also thought to be especially unlikely to support Yeltsin because both the Liberal Democratic Party and the Communist Party had beaten pro-Yeltsin parties there months earlier in the 1995 legislative election. Yeltsin's campaign took a gamble by choosing to actively campaign in Perm, which ultimately paid-off when Yeltsin won the majority of its vote in the first round of the election, defeating Zyuganov by a wide-margin. Summer 1996 Campaign advertisements grace the Moscow Metro ahead of the June election By the summer of 1996, all major polls showed Yeltsin making notable gains. Back in April, Filatov sought for the campaign to avoid anti-communist campaigning (as this risked providing Zyuganov free publicity). However, by June, he had revised his approach, and the campaign issued direct criticism of the Communist platform. Despite the decision to negatively campaign against the Communists, Yeltsin himself rarely made attacks on his opponents in his campaign speeches. Near the end of the campaign, Dzhokhar Dudayev's widow endorsed Yeltsin for President of Russia. This further neutralized criticisms of his handling of the Chechen War. The campaign held GOTV in the run up to the day of the election. This included organizing rock concerts aimed at increasing youth turnout. A June concert at Red Square drew 100,000 attendees. In cities such as Perm, concerts were held the weekend prior to the election. Result of the first round The government's decision to allow a wide election-day voting window (with polls open from 8 AM to 10 PM) was believed to allow for a greater voter turnout. Experts speculated that a stronger turnout would benefit Yeltsin's campaign. Yeltsin confidently issued predictions that he would place first in the first- round. However, his campaign's leaders kept their cards fair closer to their chest. Ultimately, Yeltsin did win the first round, albeit by only 3 percentage points. In carrying 35% Yeltsin placed between five and ten points lower than public polling had predicted he would. However, he had placed relatively near the projections of the campaign's internal polling. Many in Yeltsin's camp were actually happy that the result was close. They believed that a close margin would help motivate pro-reformist voters to participate in the second round of voting. They had feared a landslide first-round result in his favor would lead Yeltsin's supporters to be less motivated to vote in the second round. Some viewed Yeltsin as benefiting from Russian voters in the 1996 election possessing a greater concern with choosing the candidate that championed the political and economic future that they preferred with Russia, rather than evaluating the incumbent's performance. Yeltsin had also benefited from the inadequacy of his opponents' campaign efforts. Much of the opposition were mired with technical ineptness, ideological confusion, and political baggage. Many of his opponents became their own enemies, making it completely unnecessary for Yeltsin to concentrate any efforts on combatting their candidacies. Campaigning in the second round After the results of the first round were announced, Yeltsin's campaign publicly expressed confidence that was that Yeltsin was going to win the next round, declaring their belief that most of Yavlinski, Zhirinovski, Lebed and Fyodorov's supporters were going to vote for Yeltsin in the second round. To emphasize this anticipated coalition of support, Yeltsin's campaign adopted the slogan \\"Now we are united!\\" Two days after the first round of voting, Yeltsin hired Alexander Lebed as his national security advisor and, in return, received Lebed's endorsement.https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1996/07/05/hard- up-workers-greet-yeltsin-win-with-little- joy/f675ef7e-ddfe-40cb-961a-70da0d476964/Law-and-Order Candidate Finds Himself in Role of Kingmaker, by CAROL J. WILLIAMS, Los Angeles Times, 18 June 1996 During the first round, Yeltsin had brokered a secretive arrangement in which Lebed had agreed to support him in the second round. Entering the second round, the predominate concerns of voters were the war in Chechnya, skyrocketing prices, unemployment, and economic decline. Voters also desired for whoever won the presidency to oversee timely control over the payment of pensions and salaries and achieve peace in Chechnya. Yeltsin's campaign aimed to convince voters that Yeltsin was successfully implementing measures to address all of these concerns. They also sought to convince the voters that Russia would not suffer a second Perestroika. Early in the runoff, the campaign encountered major road bumps. Days after the first round the campaign had to handle controversy in the fallout of the Xerox Affair. Additionally, Yeltsin's health presented significant obstacle to the campaign. In addition to firings related to the aforementioned Xerox Affair, there were a number of other shakeups in Yeltsin's presidential administration. Yeltsin fired Pavel Grachev, at the request of Lebed.https://articles.latimes.com/1996-06-26/news/mn-18697_1_yeltsin-fires- general A week into the runoff campaign, Yeltsin fell ill upon returning from a campaign visit to Kaliningrad. Yeltsin himself publicly insisted it was merely a cold or sore throat. Despite their heavy efforts to cover-up Yeltsin's health problems, the campaign failed to entirely conceal from the public that the president's health had deteriorated significantly over the course of the campaign. Rumors variably alleged that Yeltsin was, in fact, suffering from exhaustion, a breakdown, or depression. Months after the election, it would be disclosed that he had, in fact, suffered a heart attack. For a period of time after the heart attack, Yeltsin ceased making campaign appearance and disappeared from public view. To cover up Yeltsin's absence, Yeltsin's campaign team created a \\"virtual Yeltsin\\" shown in the media through staged interviews that never happened and pre-recorded radio addresses. He later returned to the campaign trail, however, with a drastically lighter travel itinerary than he had in the first round. During the runoff campaign, one of the advertising agencies working for Yeltsin's campaign printed over a million adhesive-backed posters with Zyuganov's image on them and the warning, \\"This could be your last chance to buy food!\\" These posters appealed to a genuine fear of hunger amongst the Russian populace, and were plastered on the windows of food markets all across the country. This proved to be an effective scare tactic. Posters were printed by the campaign in the closing weeks which warned \\"The Communist Party hasn't changed its name and it won't change its methods\\". By evoking unpleasant memories of communist rule, the campaign hoped to spur turnout amongst anticommunist voters and weaken the coalition between nationalists and Communists. Despite the tone of his campaign material, a little more than a week before Election Day, Yeltsin indicated a willingness to work with the Communists declaring that he was, \\"ready for dialogue and co- operation with all those for whom the fate of Russia is a top priority\\", including \\"honest Communists\\". Near the close of the runoff campaign, Lebed became a burden to the campaign. Lebed made several incendiary remarks, which attracted controversy. On June 26, just a week before the election. While addressing an assembly of Cossacks on behalf of the campaign, Lebed said particular Russian religious sects, including Mormons, were \\"mold and scum\\" which had been \\"artificially brought into our country with the purpose of perverting, corrupting, and ultimately breaking up our state\\". In these remarks Lebed said that such \\"foul sects\\", needed to be outlawed be outlawed because they posed \\"a direct threat to Russia's security\\". He argued that Russia needed \\"established, traditional religions\\", which he named as being Russian Orthodoxy, Islam and Buddhism (noticeably omitting Judaism from this list of acceptable religions). On the day of the election, when Yeltsin made an appearance at a polling station in order to cast his own vote, he was described as appearing \\"shaky\\", drawing further concerns about his health. Result of the second round Yeltsin won the final round of the election by a decisive margin, managing to defeat Zyuganov by nearly ten million votes. On the night of the election, Zyuganov publicly conceded the race to Yeltsin, and congratulated him on his victory. Yelstin was re-inaugurated as President the following month. Yeltsin's reelection defied a pattern amongst post-Soviet transition democracies of nationalists unseating incumbent leaders during their immediate bids for reelection. Platform and positions Yeltsin was generally seen as representing the status quo (as his reelection would effectively grant a continuation of his leadership and policies), whereas Zyuganov was seen as opposing the status quo. On some issues Yeltsin was seen as being to the right of Zyuganov, whilst on other issues he was perceived as being to the left of Zyuganov. Overall, however, Yeltsin was seen as a progressive or a liberal, while Zyuganov was seen as conservative. This primarily meant that Yeltsin was pro-reform and anti-communist, whilst Zyuganov was anti-reform and pro-communist. Yeltsin was characterized as a democrat, while Zyuganov was characterized as a nationalist. Yelstin was viewed as bolstering the causes of centrists, whilst Zyuganov was viewed as representing the nationalists. In early March, Soskovets, still the de-juror chairman of the campaign, publicly outlined the themes of Yeltsin's campaign as being, social support, strengthening Russian statehood, fighting crime, and emphasizing how government activities were promoting stability. On April 6 Yeltsin addressed a congress of his supporters. He announced that he would delay unveiling his campaign platform, until following month, claiming this was to prevent his opponents from \\"distorting or using\\" his program. However, Yeltsin did provide a very general overview of what his program might entail. He spoke on the themes of the family, fighting crime, ending the war in Chechnya, and strengthening CIS integration. Yeltsin promised that he would win so that \\"these elections will not be the last.\\" On May 31, Yeltsin announced his official campaign program at an event in the city of Perm. The platform was detailed in a 127-page document entitled Russia: Individual, Family, Society, State. His platform echoed much of his 1991 platform's rhetoric. It made promises to complete economic reform, to rewrite the tax code, compensate swindled investors, strengthen Russia's social welfare system and turn the nation's army into a modern professional fighting-force. In his platform, Yeltsin claimed to have pulled Russia back from the brink of catastrophe, bringing it toward a more definitive future. He took credit himself for overseeing the development of a multi-party democracy and the foundations of a liberal-market economy. He also credited himself for keeping Russia's territorial integrity intact, and reintegrating Russia with the world. In his platform, Yeltsin wrote, Economic policy Yeltsin promised to complete his economic reform, insisting that the reforms that had already been initiated should be carried-through. However, in an effort to boost his popularity, Yelstin promised to abandon some of his more unpopular economic reform measures. Yeltsin's enthusiasm for reform was markedly different than it had been in the early years of his presidency. Yeltsin now championed a more cautious and gradual approach to reform. Yeltsin also promised to rewrite the tax code and to compensate swindled investors. In late January and early February Yeltsin made promises to spend billions of dollars in support of coal miners in order to end workers strikes. This was the first of many populist spending promises Yeltsin would make during his campaign. Yelstin promised to pay wages and pension arrears and to raise pensions. In March, to demonstrate a willingness to deliver on his promises, Yeltsin doubled many pensions. Yeltsin promised easier loans to buy homes. Yeltsin promised to provide compensation to those that had lost their savings through the hyper-inflation of 1991-92. Such payments would be distributed in a manner prioritizing war veterans, the disabled, and elderly. Yeltsin promised farmers that he would cut their electricity expenses in half and would forgive nearly 23 trillion rubles in farm debt. Military Yeltsin promised to turn the nation's army into a modern professional fighting force. Yeltsin adopted a position favoring the abolition of conscription, proposing a gradual end to the policy to be completed by the year 2000. Yeltsin believed that Russia needed to ensure its military security, spite a decrease in world tensions. He condemned NATO expansion saying that the West was trying to '\\"reinforce its world leadership.\\" Yeltsin also called for military reform to adjust to the new strategic situation, arguing that instead of hundreds of divisions that exist only on paper, Russia's military needed, \\"a few dozen divisions made up of entirely professionals.\\" Yeltsin pledged to spend 2.8 trillion rubles on for research and development for defense sector. Yeltsin called for adopting a strong nuclear deterrent policy. =Ending the Chechen War= Yeltsin attempted to separate himself from taking responsibility for the unpopular military action in Chechnya, instead contending that his ministers should be the ones blamed. Yeltsin pledged to end the war in Chechnya. He also promised to spend trillions of rubles rebuilding the war-torn region. During his campaign, Yeltsin falsely claimed that he was already achieving a peaceful end to the conflict. He even went as far as erroneously denying reports that armed conflict was actively ongoing. Yeltsin saw his candidacy as tilting upon the public's perception of his ability to deliver a peaceful to the conflict. On March 31, in a televised speech to the nation, Yeltsin announced his long- awaited peace initiative for Chechnya. He conceded that his administration would be willing to hold discussions with Chechen leader Dzhokhar Dudayev, and would be willing to discuss some form of autonomy for Chechnya within the Russian Federation short of outright independence, perhaps modeled upon Tatarstan. He named Prime Minister Chernomyrdin, who was more favorably viewed by Chechens, as heading these efforts. He announced that troops would be withdrawn from areas already secured. He also announced amnesty would be granted to most Chechen fighters. However, in a deft political move, Yeltsin declared that the decisions as to which Chechens would be granted amnesty would be decided by the State Duma, which was controlled by the Communist Party. On May 27, Yeltsin's efforts received a boost when he and acting Chechen President Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev signed a cease-fire agreement. This temporarily suspended military operations in the Chechen Republic. Social policy =Welfare= Yeltsin promised to increase welfare spending and strengthen the nation's social welfare system. Yeltsin promised to provide free transportation to the elderly. He also promised a significant increase in the amount of money given in monthly pensions. Yelstin promised that, for frozen regions of Northern Russia, he would subsidize children's holidays and build retirement homes in the south for their miners. Yeltsin promised to provide students with scholarships for science students, and better pension plans for teachers. Soviet reunification Yeltsin made efforts to one-up the nationalists and communists on the issue of Soviet reunification by taking concrete actions. Yeltsin announced a series of agreements with states of the former Soviet Union pertaining to voluntary reunification. On April 2, Yeltsin and president Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus signed a treaty calling for further cooperation between the two nations. The treaty would establish a Union State. It would also establish a \\"Community of Sovereign Republics\\" that would include supranational bodies for the military, environmental, and technical fields. A common currency was envisioned by 1997, to be followed by a joint budget and constitution afterwards. However, the nations would keep their own flags and continue to be sovereign states. Image management Within the campaign council, Malashenko was tasked with managing television advertising and enhancing the president's image. Additionally involved in shaping Yeltsin's image was Georgy Rogozin, who was given offices on the eighth floor of the President-Hotel. The campaign council hired the country's leading campaign advisers, image consultants and advertising agencies. Igor Mintusev and Yekaterina Yegerova of the campaign consulting firm Nikola M were both hired to work on Yeltsin's image. The campaign also employed a number of media consultants, who were tasked with placing favorable articles in national and regional publications. Normally a private individual, Naina Yeltsina (left) made herself more available to the public To boost his image as a reformer, and to downplay the visibility of his reliance om his secretive team of Kremlin advisors (which played negatively with the public), Yeltsin strategically made campaign appearances alongside notable political figures from outside of his inner-circle. These included Luzhkov and Boris Gromov. During the campaign, Yeltsin's wife, Naina Yeltsina, normally a private individual, took a more public role, and met with the voters.1932 - родилась Наина Иосифовна Ельцина Retrieved 24 April 2007 The campaign made use of a number of catch-phrases, including \\"chose or lose\\" and \\"vote with your heart\\".The New Russia Personal health of Yeltsin At 65 years old, Yeltsin's health had been in grave decline, with his infamously heavy consumption of alcohol being a contributing factor. By the time he had announced his reelection effort, Yeltsin was facing significant health problems. He was recovering from a series of heart attacks. In 1995 alone, Yeltsin had suffered three heart attacks. Yeltsin campaigned energetically during the first round of the election in an effort to dispel concerns about his health. Nonetheless, it was visible at times that his health was indeed declining while he was on the campaign trail. For the benefit of his health while campaigning, Yeltsin temporarily gave up his heavy drinking. Yeltsin's campaign worked to conceal his ailing health from the public. Media A television tower in Moscow Yeltsin's campaign organized the most sophisticated media effort that Russia had ever seen. While the Communist campaign relied on old-school techniques, such as campaign rallies and leafletting, Yeltsin's team commissioned firms to conduct focus-group research, polling, consulting, and direct mail advertising on behalf of campaign. Throughout the first round of the election, Yeltsin maintained a high level of media presence. His approval benefited from this. Additionally, his wife, normally a private individual, made herself available for interviews with the media. In March 1996, NTV general director Igor Malashenko was made a member of Yeltsin's newly-established campaign council. Within the campaign council, Malashenko was tasked with managing television advertising and enhancing the president's image. Malashenko commissioned Video International, the same firm that supplied NTV with most of its advertising and television programming, to produce television sports, posters and leaflets for the campaign. He awarded additional contracts for direct mail and posters to Mikhail Semenov, who owned Russia's largest direct mail firm. Rather than asking voters whether they were better off under his leadership, Yeltsin's campaign sought to ask voters whether they believed that they would be better or worse off under Zyuganov's leadership. =Favorable media bias= Ostankino Technical Center The Yeltsin campaign successfully enlisted the national television channels (ORT, RTR, NTV) and most of the written press as agents in his campaign against Zyuganov. Supplementing the work of the numerous public relations and media firms that were hired by the campaign, a number of media outlets \\"volunteered\\" their services to Yeltsin's reelection effort. For instance, Kommersant (one of the most prominent business newspapers in the country) published an anti-communist paper called Ne Dai Bog (meaning, \\"God forbid\\"). At ORT, a special committee was placed in charge of planning a marathon of anticommunist films and documentaries to be broadcast on the channel ahead of the election. In the 1991 election, there were two major television channels. RTR had supported Yeltsin, while Public Television of Russia had criticized him and covered the views of a large number of his opponents. In the 1996 election, however, no major television network was critical of Yeltsin.https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/assessing- russias-democratic-presidential-election The networks marginalized all of Yeltsin's opponents aside from Zyuganov, helping to create the perception that there were only two viable candidates. This allowed Yeltsin to pose as the lesser-evil. Near the end of the election, however, the networks began also providing coverage to the candidacy of Lebed, who had already agreed to support Yeltsin in the second round. The European Institute for Media found that Yeltsin received 53% of all media coverage of the campaign, while Zyuganov received only 18%. In their evaluation of the biases of news stories, EIM awarded each candidate 1 point for every positive story they received and subtracted a point for every negative story they received. In the first round of the election, Yeltsin scored +492 and Zyuganov scored -313. In the second round of the election, Yeltsin scored +247 and Zyuganov scored -240. One of the reasons for the media's overwhelming favoritism of Yeltsin was their fear that a Communist government would dismantle Russia's right to a free press. There were instances of direct payments made for positive coverage (so-called \\"dollar journalism\\"). Another factor contributing to the media's support of Yeltsin was that his government still owned two of the national television channels, and still provided the majority of funding to the majority of independent newspapers. In addition, Yeltsin's government also was in charge of supplying licenses to media outlets. Yeltsin's government and Luzhkov, mayor of Moscow, flexed their power and reminded the owners, publishers, and editors that newspaper licenses and Moscow leases for facilities were \\"under review\\". Before his campaign, All-Russia State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company (RTR), the state television company, had reported critically on Yeltsin's policy in Chechnya. The day before he announced his candidacy, in a move some observers believed was an attempt to intimidate the media, Yeltsin accused Russia's state television and radio of peddling \\"a batch of lies\\" in its news reports and fired RTR's chief, Oleg Poptsov. Yeltsin replaced him with Eduard Sagalaev.Скандал вокруг ВГТРК разрастается. Госдума намерена вызвать Сагалаева на ковер Additionally, Yeltsin managed to enlist Russia's emerging business elite in his campaign, including those who ran media corporations. This included Vladimir Gusinsky, owner of Most Bank, Independent Television and NTV. NTV which had, prior to the campaign, been critical towards Yeltsin's actions in Chechnya, changed the tone of their coverage. Igor Malashenko, Gusinsky's appointed head of NTV, even joined the Yeltsin campaign and led its media relations in a rather visible conflict-of- interest. In early 1996, Gusinsky and his political rival Boris Berezovsky (chairman of the Board of ORT) decided that they would put aside their differences in order to work together to support the reelection Boris Yeltsin. In mid-1996, Chubais and Yeltsin recruited a team of a handful of financial and media oligarchs to bankroll the Yeltsin campaign and guarantee favorable media coverage the president on national television and in leading newspapers.Daniel Treisman, \\"Blaming Russia First\\", Foreign Affairs, November/December 2000. In return, Chubais allowed well-connected Russian business leaders to acquire majority stakes in some of Russia's most valuable state-owned assets.See, e.g., Led by the efforts of Mikhail Lesin, the media painted a picture of a fateful choice for Russia, between Yeltsin and a \\"return to totalitarianism.\\" The oligarchs even played up the threat of civil war if a Communist were elected president.Борис-боец // The New York Times, 30 апреля 2007 While the anti-communist pro-Yeltsin media bias certainly contributed to Yeltsin's victory, it was not the sole factor. A similarly anti-communist media bias in the run-up to the 1995 parliamentary elections had failed to prevent a communist victory. Additionally, Yeltsin himself had been able to win the 1991 presidential election in spite of a strongly unfavorable media bias towards him. Advertising Early advertising for the campaign sought to portray Yeltsin as a \\"president for all\\". Early billboards of the campaign included slogans such as \\"Yeltsin is our president\\" and \\"Yeltsin is president of all Russia\\". One particularly American-style campaign tactic that Yeltsin adopted was the use of direct mail letters. =Television commercials= Before the election, it was originally predicted that Yeltsin's television advertisements would likely resemble those that had been run by Our Home Is Russia in the week prior to the 1995 legislative elections. One such advertisement that had been run by Our Home Is Russia in 1995 featured a man on the street interview of voters, with respondents either replying Our Home Is Russia or the Communist Party. Those supporting the Communist Party were shown to be far more slovenly than those supporting Our Home Is Russia. This particular ad had conveyed an image of a close two-party race (in spite of reality being that Russia's political landscape was then a multi-party system) in order to urge voter turnout. This type of advertisement was seen as having the advantage of scaring voters into supporting Yeltsin as the lesser-evil, and encouraging turnout by portraying a razor-thin race. However, it was also seen as having the disadvantage of reminding the voters that they could vote for Zyuganov if they wish to see Yeltsin removed from office, essentially providing free advertising to the Zyuganov campaign. Yeltsin's television campaign mainly focused on repairing his own image, rather than issuing attack ads on Zyuganov. The challenge his campaign faced was that, due to Yeltsin's negative ratings and overexposure on television, it was believed he could not effectively deliver his campaign pitch himself. Instead, the pitch would need to be delivered indirectly. This meant that advertisements would not feature Yeltsin himself. A barrage of advertisements were released which featured working-class Russians, veterans, and elderly people providing testimonials in support of Yeltsin's leadership. The groups that were portrayed in these ads were demographics which typically voted for the communist party. Therefore, these ads aimed these testimonials towards peeling-away voters from demographics that typically leaned communist. Yeltsin's television advertising campaign avoided addressing difficult issues, such as the faltering economy. Mikhail Margelov, the head of Video International, said, Russian law prevented candidates from running advertisements before March 15. However, despite of this regulation, the Yeltsin campaign began broadcasting a set of campaign commercials under the guise of \\"public service announcements\\" earlier than was permitted. The Russian airwaves were flooded during on Victory Day with videos in which World War II veterans recalled their service and hinted at an ominous future under communist leadership. In one such video, a veteran remarked, \\"I just want my children and grandchildren to finally savor the fruits of the victory we fought for.\\" Finances Election laws specified that campaigns could spend up to $2.9 million. The campaign claimed that its official expenditures were $3 million. This amount does not accurately reflect the amount that was spent towards his campaign in both \\"unofficial\\" expenditures and outside expenditures. Estimates of the cost of Yeltsin's campaign extended into the hundreds of millions of dollars. Yeltsin had run continuous television advertisements that were purchased at $15,000-$30,000 per minute. He employed a large campaign staff, traveled extensively, and distributed enormous amounts of high-quality campaign material. Yeltsin's campaign was able to exceed spending limits, in part, by spending money through support groups separate from the official campaign organization. This took advantage of a loophole in which such groups were outside of the legal provisions relating to campaign spending limits. Additionally, Yeltsin's government found it necessary to force the Central Bank to provide it an extra $1 billion in order to begin to deliver on his campaign promises before the day of the election Support from business community Yeltsin's campaign received immense financial backing from the business community. An advantage of incumbency that the campaign benefited from was Yeltsin's ties to Oligarchs. Oligarchs gave significant funding to Yeltsin's campaign. Oligarchs that had benefited under his leadership felt obliged to support him in order to secure their own positions. Oligarchs believed that a communist victory would be devastating for them. Among the oligarchs supporting Yeltsin were seven that subsequently were dubbed \\"Semibankirschina\\". Yeltsin received the backing of businesspeople who were fearful of a communist victory. For instance, Yeltsin saw the support of oil executives such as Vagit Alekperov (head of Lukoil) and Rem Vyakhirev ( head of Gazprom) who were fearful of nationalization of oil under a Zyuganov presidency. As an advantage of his incumbency, Yeltsin had the liberty of traveling on the presidential jet. In contrast, Zyuganov had to travel by commercial flights. Oligarchs and businesses provided the campaign an amount that was estimated to be between $100 million and $500 million. However, as mentioned earlier, the official campaign spending was reported to be a mere $3 million. Following the election a financial fraud investigation arose from the Xerox Affair. =Loans for shares scheme= With the election approaching, strengthening support from Russia's new private business elite was believed to be critical to Yeltsin's reelection effort.https://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/polisci/faculty/treisman/PAPERS_NEW/Loans%20for%20shares%20Post- Soviet%20Affairs%20for%20website.pdf Beginning in 1995, Yeltsin's government began to use a loans for shares scheme in privatizing state-owned shares in companies. The auctions were rigged, being non-competitive and frequently controlled by favored insiders with political connections.Privatization in Transition Economies: The Ongoing Story - ed. Ira W. Lieberman, Daniel J. Kopf, p.112 The scheme was structured in a manner that made Yeltsin's victory a strong interest of the investors involved. The two-stage program was structured so that the loans would be made before the election, but the auction of the shares could only take place beginning after the election, making it of financial concern for them that Yeltsin would win the election. =Low-cost bonds scheme= David E. Hoffman of The Washington Post reported that, during the election effort, Russian oligarchs profited from special deals involving low-cost government bonds. This, consequentially, sweetened the business community's support of Yeltsin's reelection effort. Campaign organizations Central campaign The campaign's headquarters were in the President-Hotel Chubais, who became the head of the campaign Oleg Soskovets served as the campaign's original chairman. When it was first launched, the campaign's structure consisted solely of a campaign management team led by Soskovets. The management team had set-up shop at the campaign's headquarters on the ninth level of the President-Hotel. Yeltsin ultimately fired Soskovets as his campaign chairman on March 23, and hired Chubais to lead the campaign in his place. This represented a key change in the ideological slant of the campaign leadership. While Soskovets was a nationalist hardliner, Chubais was an avid reformer. Additionally, on March 19, Yeltsin had established new \\"campaign council\\" to lead the campaign. Notably, this campaign council featured a number of liberals, in contrast to the nationalist hardliners that had been appointed to the initial campaign management team. Among those that Yeltsin appointed to the newly-formed campaign council was Viktor Ilyushin, one of the predominate Kremlin insiders who urged him to abandon Skoskovets' campaign strategy. Additionally, after firing Soskovets as the head of his campaign, Yeltsin invited a number of shadow campaign groups to merge their operations with his official campaign effort. In doing so, Yeltsin handed-over much of the many responsibilities of the campaign to these groups. After integrating various organizations that had been supporting his candidacy, the structure of the central campaign lacked cohesion. Additionally, after the initial creation of the campaign council, the campaign briefly acquired complicated leadership arrangement. Yeltsin had not dissolved the original Soskovets campaign management team. While its leadership had joined the campaign council, they also continued to work independently and maintained offices on a separate floor from the rest of the campaign council members. Between both the campaign council and the original management team (which had not been dissolved), the campaign had acquired two competing leadership groups. However, the campaign council quickly emerged as the predominant leadership group, and ultimately negated the authority of the management team. Consequentially, with the campaign council emerging as the campaign's predominate leadership, liberals were in charge of a campaign that (under its original management team) had previously been run by nationalist-leaning hardliners. Yeltsin's daughter Tatyana Dyachenko was a key figure, serving as the de facto co-head of the campaign While Chubais was the official head of the campaign, being named both Yeltsin's campaign manager and chairman of campaign council, he managed the campaign largely in tandem with Dyachenko, who was the de facto co-head of the campaign. Dyachenko coordinated much of the campaign from her Motorola cell phone. Dyachenko used her phone very frequently to remain in constant contact with both her father and with members of the campaign operations. She served as the primary conduit of communication between Yeltsin and his campaign operation. Yury Yarov served as the campaign's executive head. Also involved in the central campaign was Georgy Rogozin, who was in charge of security, as well as some image-management. Rogozin was given offices on the eighth floor of the President-Hotel. Dyachenko also recruited her associate Viktoriya Mitina to work for the campaign. =Members of the campaign council= *Mikhail Barsukov -fired after Xerox Affair *Viktor Chernomyrdin *Anatoly Chubais chairman *Tatyana Dyachenko *Viktor Ilyushin *Alexander Korzhakov -fired after Xerox Affair *Yury Luzhkov *Igor Malashenko *Sergei Shakhrai *Yury Yarov *Nikolai Yegorov Ilyushin oversaw the overall campaign operations. He exerted strategic control over the campaign. Dyachenko was in charge of personal contact between Yeltsin and the campaign. Chubais was in charge of the campaign's finances. Chernomyrdin was in charge of financial policy. Malechenko was responsible for media relations. Luzkhov led the campaign efforts within the city of Moscow. =Analytical group= On March 19, simultaneously to forming the campaign council, Yeltsin also impaneled an \\"analytical group\\" to be led by Chubais. The organization enlisted the work of Dyachenko, Malashenko, Illyushin and Saratov as well as Valentin Yumashev, pollster Aleksandr Oslon, Vasily Shakhnovsky (chief of staff to Moscow's Mayor Luzhkov), Media-Most executive Sergei Zverev, and Duma deputy (and former deputy premier) Sergei Shakhrai. =Foreign consultants= Flush with money, the central campaign hired an extensive number of contractors for its campaign efforts. Most major research groups, think tanks, and public relations firms in Russia, at one point, worked for the campaign. However, with Russians being relatively new to electoral politics, the campaign campaign also solicited the advice of private consults from abroad. Among those advising the campaign was Tim Bell, a British political strategist that had helped shape the public-image of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Team of Americans A team of American political consultants consisting of George Gorton, Joe Shumate, and Richard Dresner advised the campaign. They all had notable experience in American political campaigns. Gorton had just recently worked on Pete Wilson's failed US presidential campaign and Dresner had previously worked on a gubernatorial campaign of Bill Clinton's. The three American consultants were hired in February by Soskovets, who hired them through a San Francisco firm with connections in Moscow. They were reportedly paid $250,000 for their consultation. Formally, their role was as advisors to the Yeltsin family. The team was given an unlimited budget with which to conduct focus groups and research. By this time, it was not unusual for experienced American consultants to be recruited to Russian campaigns. In fact, during Yeltsin's 1991 presidential campaign, the Democratic Russia-run national initiative group supporting his candidacy had held a two-day series of meetings in which they solicited advice from a team of five American consultants. Despite the fact that it was not unusual, Yeltsin's team did not want to risk allowing Zyuganov to exploit the presence of foreign consults in the Yeltsin campaign as a means to lodge xenophobia-laden attacks on Yeltsin. They especially worried that the optics created by the involvement of foreign consultants might play negatively amid the particularly nationalist tone of the 1996 election. To avoid such optics, the team of American consultants were kept isolated from the rest of the campaign, and remained a secret until after the election was over. They never met with Yeltsin himself, but instead sent detailed and unsigned memos to Dyachenko, with whom they worked closely. They worked out of two suites on the eleventh floor of the President-Hotel, directly across the hall from Dyachenko's office. To hide their involvement, the group claimed to be American businessmen conducting consumer research. Much of their advice proved to be obvious and redundant, however. While they subsequently claimed to have played a critical role in the campaign, this has been refuted by others in the campaign. Dyachenko, for instance, reported that none of their contributions were central to the campaign's planning or strategy. They had no apparent communications with campaign leaders such as Chubais and Malashenko. Because they had been hired by Soskovets, many of those leading the campaign distrusted and disregarded the consultants. Aleksandr Oslon commented on the role of the American advisors, stating, \\"when all the real decisions were made, they were not present.\\" Despite this, the Americans subsequently boasted about their role in the campaign in a Time magazine cover-story which hyperbolically proclaimed, \\"Yanks to the Rescue\\".http://content.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19960715,00.html National campaign structure Outside of its central leadership, the campaign consisted of two parallel structures. One was its formal national campaign organization, the second was an organization composed of outside groups. =Formal national campaign organization= The formal nationwide campaign was largely overseen by Yarov, also a member of the campaign council. Yarov was responsible for the national campaign's official organizational work. Under his guidance, the campaign employed local representatives all across Russia. The local representatives were typically individuals who served in local governments. Shakhrai, also a member of the campaign council, assumed a role of coordinating with regional leaders. This was similar to a role that Yegorov occupied on the campaign management team. =All-Russian Movement for Social Support for the President (ODOP)= The All-Russian Movement for Social Support for the President (also known as the ODOP) was an organization of Yeltsin's campaign which collaborated with outside groups providing their support to his candidacy. This formed the second nationwide structure of the campaign. The ODOP and Chubais' campaign council jointly served as the main drivers of Yeltsin's campaign effort. Originally, Boris Yeltsin saw support from several political leaders and organizations who each declared themselves to be his candidacy's primary nongovernmental sponsor. Vladimir Shumeyko announced that his social organization/quasi political party Reform's New Course would spearhead Yeltsin's reelection effort. Around the same time, the leaders of Our Home – Russia proclaimed that they were to be Yeltsin's primary campaign organization. After weeks of fighting between the two groups, Sergei Filatov started to form what would be the ODOP. The goal was to create a group that would serve as the campaign's predominant national support structure. The group took on the task of finishing the work to secure the requisite paperwork and signatures to officialize Yeltsin's nomination, a task which it finished by April 5.Вторая кампания Бориса Ельцина They thereafter convened the ODOP's founding congress on April 6. The founding conference made official the ODOP as an organization. It was immediately the most prominent organized movement supporting Yeltsin's candidacy. The organization drew membership from a vast array of more than 250 preexisting organization, including political parties, unions, civic groups and social organization. Among the groups were Reform's New Course, Our Home – Russia, Alexander Yakovlev's Russian Party of Social Democracy, Lev Ponomaryov's Democratic Russia and Arkady Volsky's Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs. The organization was led by Filatov along with Ilyushin. They located the organization's headquarters on the tenth floor of the President Hotel, just above Yeltsin central campaign's offices. They hired dozens of campaign managers from various political parties to help run the organization. These included former Press Minister Sergei Gryzonov, Presidential Chief of Staff Nikolai Yegorov, and President of the \\"Politicka\\" Fund Vyachelslav Nikonov. People's House A sub-organization of ODOP was named \\"People's House\\". This organization forged connections with citizen groups and was the unofficial disburser of campaign funds. This was also directly overseen by Filatov. Key members of ODOP leadership *Nikolai Filatov (co-head of ODOP; in charge of PR and People's House) *Viktor Illyushin (co-head of ODOP; national campaign organizer) *Nikolai Yegorov (in charge of regional work) *Vyacheslav Nikonov (in charge pre-election analysis) =Moscow campaign organization= A separate campaign organization existed in Moscow, dedicated to rallying votes in the nation's capital, which was a rare bastion of strong support for Yeltsin. This component of the campaign was established early on. On January 22, it was reported that Moscow mayor Yury Luzhkov had set aside his disagreements with Yeltsin to join his campaign. Luzhkov would be tasked with helping deliver Yeltsin votes in Moscow. =Relations between organizations= With the exception of Moscow, it was not clarified what organizations were to be the campaign's primary regional representative. Consequentially, four different organizations acted under the separate assumptions that their regional offices were the primary regional representatives of the campaign. In each region, the formal national campaign organization (led by Yarov) would appoint its own representative. The ODOP would appoint their own separate representative as well. Our Home – Russia, despite being a member of ODOP, would also appoint representatives of their own. A fourth organization, named NarodnyiDom, would also appoint their own representative. In some locations the regional representatives of these organizations worked together, but in other locations there was no coordination between them. While confusing, having multiple separate organizations also gave significant flexibility to the national campaign. In regions that had strong local parties and civic organizations, the campaign headquarters would often treat the ODOP as their main regional representative. Therefore, the campaign would benefit from the work of the existing grassroots organizations that composed the ODOP. However, in regions with weaker nongovernmental organizations, the campaign headquarters would often treat the official national campaign organization, headed by Yarov, as their main regional representative. This allowed them to avoid being \\"held hostage\\" to the demands of grassroots organizations that had little or no local influence. Outside groups While many outside groups supporting Yeltsin officially coordinated with the campaign through the ODOP, a number outside organizations functioned independently of the campaign. NarodnyiDom NarodyniDom (; ) was an outside organization supporting Yeltsin's campaign. The official claim was that the nationwide organization provided nongovernmental consultive social services to citizens and that its chapters served a social club for residents with free coffee and occasional entertainment. In actuality, campaign money was funneled through the organization to eschew detection. Vote or Lose Shirt from the Vote or Lose campaign Sergey Lisovsky organized the Vote or Lose campaign. Vote or Lose was a $10 million series of television programs and rock concerts in the style of Rock the Vote. It was a get out the vote campaign aimed at mobilizing the youth vote in support of Yeltsin.

While in France, Katharine movingly wrote her mother: \\"We drove back quite late we weren't very far from the front lines - say eight miles & the sky was lit by the guns - just like summer lightning & I felt that I saw just what Raymond & E must have seen every night.\\"\\"The Home of Our Delight: Mells and the First World War\\" Exhibit: www.homeofourdelight.org.uk Katharine was recommended for a Member of the British Empire (MBE) award for her performance of duty.\\"Mrs. Katharine Asquith.\\" First World War Volunteers, British Red Cross. https://vad.redcross.org.uk/Card?fname=katharine&sname;=asquith&id;=6750&first;=true&last;=true > Later life Raymond was killed in action on 15 September 1916 during the Battle of the Somme.

She welcomed many Catholic writers and thinkers such as Evelyn Waugh, Christopher Hollis, Douglas Woodruff, Siegfried Sassoon, Hilaire Belloc, Martin D'Arcy, and Ronald Knox.

Another prominent convert, close friend and frequent visitor to Mells was the poet Siegfried Sassoon who was received into the Roman Catholic church in 1957 and later buried in St. Andrew's churchyard. After the Second World War, in 1947, she welcomed Monsignor Ronald Knox to Mells as her unofficial private chaplain. Knox, himself a convert, had been Roman Catholic chaplain at the University of Oxford before the war. While a resident, Knox finished his re-translation of the Latin Vulgate Bible into English. Early in 1957, he was diagnosed with terminal cancer, and Katharine cared for him in person until his death later in the year. He was buried in the churchyard at St Andrew's, where Katharine was also buried on her death in 1976, at the age of 90.

Tuke dedicated much of his time encouraging humanitarian treatment for the mental ill. His knowledge is summarized and clarified in many of his medical books, in which he often takes controversial and novel standpoints. The presented book discusses the causes of mental disorders in relation to the maturation of society and considers factors which can positively contribute to the prevention of psychiatric diseases.  Historical context  Being part of the movement dynamic psychotherapy in the later 19th century, Tuke is acknowledged to be one of the earliest authors to coin the term \\"Psychotherapeutics\\". He combines psychological insights similar to Freud's psychodynamic therapy with a medical and somatic approach that Tuke adopted from his studies of medicine. Living in a time in which mental illness is no longer regarded as the consequence of having committed a religious sin, a more biological basis and environmental foundation of psychiatric diseases was established. An especially pronounced insight of this viewpoint is that mental illness is caused by genetical factors as well as influenced by nurture and is therefore treatable and may be even preventable.  The breakthroughs of the 19th century  In the 17th and 18th centuries there was a gradually increasing focus on the brain itself and how brain injury affects behavioral displays like in the famous case of Phineas Gage. Additionally, a growing interest in reflexes facilitated the viewpoint that behavior is not necessarily self- generated but can be also environmentally caused. However, despite the huge medicinal and factual progress in the study of the brain and its influence on behavior, the new insights did not yet contribute to an improved treatment of psychiatric diseases and brain injuries. Although there was an increasing interest in mental processes and behavior, until the middle of the 19th century psychology as a scientific study and subject itself was largely disregarded and rather considered to be a branch of philosophy. Irrevocably, this mindset turned enormously due to five scientific discoveries that enabled the development of modern neurophysiology and are still relevant for today's psychology. They were the discovery of the 1) cerebrospinal axis, 2) the growing impact of the reflex and its relation to mental functioning in studies by Marshall Hall (1790-1875), 3) the localization of brain functions such as the center of speech production (Broca's Area), 4) the discovery of the nerve cell by Camillo Golgi (1843-1926) and lastly, the 5) disentangling of the communication between neurons by Ramón y Cajal (1852-1934). All these findings consider a biological and physical basis by which behavior can be explained. This is also an opinion held by Tuke himself, as he not only waited for a proof of a physical basis for normal behavior but also as an explanation for what he terms \\"insanity\\".  The emergence of experimental psychology  Although psychology as an independent scientific study was largely discredited by well-known scientists and philosophers such as Immanuel Kant (1724-1804), scientists such as Johann Friedrich Herbart (1776–1841), took the issue as a reason to invent a mathematical basis for scientific psychology. Despite his unsuccessful attempts to quantify behavior, his efforts were taken up by the scientists Ernst Heinrich Weber (1795–18 78) and Gustav Theodor Fechner (1801–1887), aiming to measure the mathematical relationships between the physical magnitudes of external stimuli and the psychological intensities of the resulting sensations. Their vast and unique insights are later coined by the term \\"Psychophysics\\". Meanwhile, the breakthroughs in neuronal structure and physiology (the five most important listed above), evidenced a physical and biological nature of human functioning that can serve as the basis for scientific experiments in studying behavior. One of the principal founders of experimental physiology, Hermann Helmholtz (1821–1894), conducted experimental studies of a wide range of topics that would later be of huge interest to psychologists. The speed of neural transmission, the physical natures of sound and color and our perception of them count as some of the most important insights. Together with the German physiologists, psychologists and philosopher Wilhelm Wundt (1832-1920) he addressed more complicated psychological questions than had not been investigated experimentally in the past. Of particular interest for both was the nature of apperception, which is defined as the point at which a perception occupies the central focus of conscious awareness. To conduct all the studies, in 1879, Wundt founded the first laboratory worldwide that was specifically dedicated to original research in experimental psychology. Tuke himself as a physicist was largely interested in the practical and experimental part of psychology and psychiatry but contributed to the development of experimental psychology mainly by providing theories and hypothesis about biological and environmental factors that influence the mind and also cause mental illnesses. His research and findings are majorly based on observational studies and analysis of existing literature and statistics.  Content  The presented book discusses the causes of mental disorders in relation to the maturation of society and considers factors which can positively contribute to the prevention of psychiatric diseases. By considering the ecological and social conditions of people, starting in prehistoric times until the late nineteen hundreds, it is analyzed in twelve chapters how these factors and a steady growth in complexity of civilizations contribute to an alleged increase in prevalence of mental illnesses. He claims, that emotional and cognitive conflict is a natural human response to life's injuries, which he defines as the rapidly changing lifestyle during the British Industrial revolution from the Mid-18th century to early 19th century and the rising gap between the rich and the poor. Consequently, the majority of insane people would always be found in a civilized community.  Causes of insanity  In the first chapter, Tuke gives a broad overview about the diverse set of factors that he considers to be of vital importance when answering what causes and influences the development of insanity. By doing this, he acknowledges biological, societal, environmental, cultural, as well as religious and political factors. He claims, that all these factors accumulate and increase in intensity when societies became more complex and civilized. = Intoxication and defective nourishment = Throughout history, intoxication could be found in almost any community, especially the consume of alcohol but also of other stimulants. The intake of mind- and mood-altering drugs is distributed in time and space. Tuke claims, that intoxication leads to the exhaustion of the nervous system and inhibits it to function properly. This degeneration would accumulate in succeeding generations, especially when considering the increasing importance alcohol gains with the maturation of society. With a similar mechanism he describes that malnutrition contributes to an increased chance to develop insanity, which in his opinion could be evidenced by every underfed population. This would also apply to the British society at the time. Until the late 19th century, chronic hunger and malnutrition were the norm for the majority of the population of the world, including Britain. The life expectancy in Britain suffered immensely, in large part due to malnutrition. A usual worker of a factory usually did not exceed the age of 40. Partly the shortage of food can be explained by the fact that food supply in Great Britain was adversely affected by the Corn Laws (1815-1846). The Corn Laws, which imposed tariffs on imported grain, were enacted to keep prices high in order to benefit domestic producers. As additionally population grew exponentially in these years in urban areas, among others noticed by Thomas Maltus, not enough food could be provided and money was scarce among the lower ranks of society. All these factors increased poverty and malnutrition and may explain the high prevalence of insane people among the lower working classes of British Society. Not surprisingly, Tuke names pauperism too be one of the major influential factors causing insanity. = Dissolute Life, Depraved Habits and Disappointments in Love = Tuke was among the first scientists to recognize that emotional problems and general life satisfaction highly influence the mental health of a person, disregarding his societal rank. During the Industrial Revolution steadily rising standards caused changes in the mindset of society. An increased incidence of emotional conflict was the result of the competitive spirit of the modern civilization. When people compared their living standards, they often became dissatisfied with their own and luxury goods grew in importance. Tuke explains, that this kind of depression interferes with normal cognitive functioning and additionally, often leads to the consume of drugs and thus indirectly precipitates insanity. = Overwork = Another consequence of the industrial revolution in the 18th century was the increased number of hours per day that people belonging to the working class had to absolve with only little payment. As increasingly more factories were build, more workers were needed in total and a worker had to work on average more under terrible working conditions. Oftentimes, even children were used as workers in the factory to ensure the survival of the family. On average, children were paid less than 10 Cent for a fourteen-hours shift. However, also members from upper classes were confronted with an increased amount of work to maintain their business. According to Tuke, both, the mental and the physical exhaustion like business or monetary worries, lead to emotional stress which has similar effects on mental health as dissatisfaction with the own living circumstances. = Intellectual Strain = Intellectual strain in form of excesses of educational work, is also a potent cause Tuke introduces in his book. Similar to the physical overwork mentioned above, Tuke expects similar consequences for mental exhaustion. As with the industrial society also the external societal pressure rises, so did the urge for self-perfection and societal improvement. The pressure and overthinking in turn, is thought to cause sleeplessness which interferes with the proper formation of memories. Contrastingly, he underlines that the contrary, namely mental underload is also a dangerous factor considering the development of mental illnesses. He states that the upper classes of society are heading towards a style of living in which intellect is of minor importance as compared to luxuries and reputation. Less cognitive engagement would cause cognitive abilities to decline in the long-term and would also elevate mental tension. = Religious and political excitement = Political excitement is termed as one of the major influential factors that positively contribute to insanity. As society increases in size, opinions become more diversified. The traditionally and religiously shaped views become challenged, which according to Tuke interferes with the implementation of an ideal society. This would open room for insanity to arise and spread. Additionally, political and religious excitement is hypothesized to generally lead to emotional stress and upheaval which would disturb the mental equilibrium that is required in order to ensure mental health.  Prevalence of Insanity in the course of history  = Insanity in Prehistoric times = As compared to a completely uncivilized tribe, Tuke states that more mature communities are increasingly exposed to unfavorable psychological influences. Excessive as well as deprived education, the increasing acceptance of drug consume, and the competitive spirit rising in the course of history are claimed to be among the major causes of insanity. He emphasizes that this is not the result of civilization itself, but that humans have never realized the ideal of a society and are probably never able to fully apply it. Living in a civil society in his view means to reclaim from barbarism, intemperance, dissipation and pauperism and to support and help each other. According to Tuke, the prevalence of insanity in prehistoric times was the lowest because people were living in uncultivated tribes and were not interested in modern education. Moreover, although intoxication is reported in early times, the mind-altering drugs that Native tribes used or still use, are mostly used for rituals and only rarely in private. Hereby, Tuke refers to old Indian tribes that use Marihuana in some of their ceremonies. Additionally, even the so-called savages did not behave intemperate even when intoxicated. Moreover, according to Tuke, prehistoric tribes did not suffer from religious and political perplexities nor commercial speculation. People may believe in evil spirits or ghosts but this mental imbalance is counteracted by the belief in charms. All in all, Tuke explains that savages in the past and present live an uncultivated but satisfied life with no pursue after perfection and luxury. In his view, this renders them almost invulnerable to mental disease. Nevertheless, he stresses throughout his book that society itself is something every human should pursue and a savage life also has his own drawbacks, but insanity not being among them. = Insanity among the Jews and Egypts = According to Tuke, as time passes, intoxication became increasingly important. He refers to a biblical story, in which Noah planted a vineyard together with Satan. The bible also evidences that intemperate behavior while intoxicated became more prevalent. Yet, for example alcohol was not yet the scourge of society which it is in his opinion among some nations today. In generally, Jews are even considered to be sober and Egypts to have only rare experiences with alcohol in the public and private domain. Jews as well as Egypts are thought to live a simple but not savage life in accordance with nature and moral standards. As their lives are centered around food, they did not have experience scarcity. Tuke, explains that their agricultural lifestyle, prevented malnutrition and hunger even among the poor. As also the other risk factors do not apply to this period of time, Tuke explains this to be the reason for the himself found low prevalence of insane people at the time. = Insanity in relation to the working classes = In this chapter, he underlines with the statistics the immense increase of insanity in the last 20 years. He claims that 20 years ago, only one out of 577 was diagnosed to be insane, whereas this raised to 1 in 370. He is convinced, that alone these today's statistics yield enough ground to conclude that insanity is determined by the modern civilized society of industrialized Britain. Even totally diverse states of a nation lead to the same determination. He declares that he is aware, that this increasing number may be partially explained by more diagnoses in general as well as a rising awareness for mental illnesses. Nevertheless, he asserts that the statistics prove that this cannot solely be explained by these two factors and that when looking at history, clear signs exist that point towards factors that evolved with the maturation of society. However, he also observes a trend within the population at his time, in which it becomes obvious that most insane people are to be found in the pauper part of society. He attributes this to the absence of rational employment that seems to be present in the lower ranks of the community. Pauper people in his eyes, are victims of debasing habits, indulgence in vices, less literary and scientific pursuits and mental stagnation. The mentality of the lower classes seems to be coined by recklessness, drunkenness, poverty and misery which are all risk factors in developing mental illness. He terms this \\"uncivilized behavio[u]r in a civilized society\\". As moral and physical conditions are generally bad among the poor, the clear trend in prevalence seems obvious to him. Moreover, since the pauper population misses education and mental work, they often seek other ways for excitement mostly in a political manner. Their intense emotional disturbance, alternating between intense joy and disappointment, in combination with malnutrition and manifold miseries are clear factors that influence the mental health of a worker. He is aware that the dissatisfaction of life caused by the bad living and working conditions prove additionally counteractive to mental health and facilitate the intake of stimulants and the development of intemperate habits which only further exacerbate their misery. As also children and women are employed in the factories, no time can be provided to adequately teach and raise the children to ensure a healthy cerebral development to prevent insanity in following generations. He concludes that among the working class almost every influential factor that he mentions in the first chapter on the causes of insanity, especially apply to the working class. Member of this societal class are generally poor, underfed, oftentimes intoxicated, dissatisfied and disappointed and generally neither in physical nor in mental balance. He infers that by the maturation of society the gap enlarges and thus simultaneously gives rise to even more insanity. = Insanity among the upper classes = Although the prevalence of insanity seems to be rather absent in the upper classes of society, the statistics also identified a few cases of insanity among the rich. Tuke explains this by some of the prior mentioned factors that also apply to this rank of society. Admittedly, the prosperous people do not face physical overwork in the factories, but oftentimes severe mental work. He argues that the mental exhaustion caused by the maintenance of the business in many cases leads to mental fatigue and sleeplessness, which both interfere with proper memory formation. Business worry and money troubles lead to anxiety which disturbs the emotional and cognitive balance and thus concurs to the development of insanity. Additionally, the upper especially intellectual classes are confronted with immense societal pressure to perform at their best, further increasing anxiety. On the other hand, other parts of the higher classes are undereducated and their daily livings circle around the possession of luxury goods and to fulfil beauty standards. Another immensely critical factors lies in the enormous use of stimulants, especially alcohol, which is a daily practice in upper sections of the population. Alcohol is part of each meal and drunken because of boredom and reputation. This mindset is toxic in Tuke's eyes and more importantly degenerates cerebral structures.  Prevention of Insanity  Although Tuke is already aware that insanity is also partially favored by a specific combination of genetic material and thus predetermined, in the last chapters he designates some characteristics and habits which can avoid insanity and terms this \\"auto-prophylaxes\\". He emphasizes that in general a mentally as well as physically balances life is of great importance to ensure mental health. This can reached by enough sleep, physical and mental exercise and a generally healthy lifestyle. He further stresses to distance oneself from any type of intoxication as it interferes with the regular cognitive functioning and also harms the cerebral cortex. Next to the general physical conditions, he also points to the importance of a morally acceptable way of living by avoiding political and religious fanaticism and mysticism, \\"Mental safety will be greatly increased by pursuing that middle course between them with an honest appreciation of the laws of emotions\\". He underlines the importance of cheerfulness and to decrease the importance of luxury goods and reputation to ensure the health of the nervous system. Children should be adequately thought and formed according to religious moral norms and provided with knowledge, to assure a healthy cerebral development. As society decreases social pressure and diminished the gap between the rich and the poor, there is hope for the future to prevent the unfavorable trend civilization is heading to.  Reactions to his work  Despite his large contribution to today's knowledge about and theses on the sociocultural causes of mental illnesses, Tuke renders largely unknown after his death. This may be partially explained by the fact that he acknowledged himself only as a compiler of information rather than an innovator. However, he remains a major figure in British psychiatry in the late 19th century. During his lifetime he was a well-known scientist and psychiatrist whose work received much attention within the medical and psychiatric ranks. His contemporaries often regarded him as a \\"scientific sponge\\", gathering already existing knowledge about mental illnesses and aligning the findings with his social and societal observations. He was widely appreciated by taking controversial standpoints, even if they do not entirely match current scientific opinions and literature. During his visits of several asylums in 1853, he even raised international attention for his scientific and statistic work about the prevalence of mental disorders and the causes. As a consequence of his rich experiences abroad, Tuke was soon seen as an international expert on mental illness and was lecturing at York Medical School. 5 years later, in collaboration with John Charles Bucknill, he published the Manual of Psychological Medicine which served as a standard work for lunacy for years. As the joint editor of the Journal of Mental Science starting in 1880, he continues to be regarded as one of the most influential scientists from 19th century British psychiatry. Although he often focused on novel and rather uncommon phenomena, he was largely accepted and appreciated by leading British psychiatrists, neurologists and psychologists, including Jean-Marie Charcot, Hippolyte Bernheim and Victor Horsley with which he worked on the Dictionary of Psychological medicine. His widespread and even international recognition positively contributed the way with which his work was received. His books, including the Insanity in Ancient and Modern life, are often cited and referred to in scientific literature about sociocultural causes and influential factors contributing to insanity in the past and present. Additionally, he is often minorly mentioned in historical books about the emergence of psychology as a discipline. Tuke was among the first persons to recognize an increase in the prevalence of insanity by making use of statistics to identify possible causes, which he clarifies in great detail in Insanity in Ancient and Modern Life. As many of his other books, the book was used as a psychiatric workbook for classes on mental illness.  Other publications  Tuke wrote many medical books, especially focusing on the topic of insanity and mental illnesses and its causes and resulting implications for treatment. During his time when he conducted a new course on psychological medicine at York Medical School, he also published several case studies and notes on psychopathological patients which he observed in striking detail. Together with Dr. John Bucknill, his medical colleague, he agreed upon writing the well-known Manual of Psychological Medicine, in which he discusses the classification, causes and the different forms of insanity. In 1880, he became a joint editor of the Journal of Mental Sciences. Around the same time, he published one of his most influential books, Illustrations of the Influence of the Mind Upon the Body in Health and Disease (1872). The book Insanity in Ancient and Modern Life (1878), followed by The History of the Insane in the British Isles (1882) count as some of his most influential works. In 1884, during his visit in America, he also collected material for his book The Insane in the United States and Canada. In all this works he reflects on the culturally and societal conditions people find themselves in and relates this to causes and prevalence of insanity between different nations. Together with The Insanity in Ancient and Modern Life, the medical book The Past and Present Provision for the Insane Poor in Yorkshire considers the differences in prevalence among upper and lower social classes. Finally, he became an editor of the Dictionary of Psychological Medicine, being the most cherished psychiatric work of the 19th century. Among an international group consisting of 128 authors, Tuke analyses and discusses in 68 sections many of the complex social, cognitive and professional dimensions of nineteen century's psychiatry.

Bou Meng was tortured for weeks, with many kinds of torture devices (electric shock, bamboo sticks whips, rattans, cart axles, etc.) and he had to fabricate confessions. He was spared from being slaughtered only because he was a highly skilled painter.Huy Vannak (2010), pp. 37-43 His wife, according to the records of Tuol Sleng camp, was tortured and killed on August 16, 1977. His children ended up in a children's center and eventually they starved to death.Huy Vannak (2010), p. 11 In 2002, he was believed to be dead. In January 2002, Cambodian newspaper Phnom Penh Post wrote that he had died in the 1990s, while Cambodian magazine Searching for the truth wrote that he had \\"disappeared\\". When Bou Meng found out that people thought that he was dead, he went back to S-21 (which had been converted into a museum).  Early life  Bou Meng was born in 1941 into a peasant family. His father's name was Bou Hak, while his mother's name was Lay Kat; the family lived along the Mekong River, close to Kampong Cham. As it was normal at that time, many Cambodians didn't have a birth certificate and they often didn't know their exact birth date. His family was poor, but their conditions weren't that different from other Cambodian families. At that time, Cambodia was under the French protectorate and the French had imposed heavy taxes on Cambodians. This, combined with the lack of land to farm, worsened their living conditions.Huy Vannak (2010), p. 16 Another problem was the lack of hospitals in the region where Bou Meng lived. If somebody got sick, they had to be taken to the district hospital.Huy Vannak (2010), p. 18 Bou Meng studied at Kor pagoda with the monks since there were very few schools and teachers. Therein the monks taught him Khmer literature and mathematics. In the same pagoda, he became very interested in painting and its interest grew stronger and stronger. In 1956, at the age of 15, Bou Meng became a monk . At that time, virtually every Cambodian family had at least a son who had become a monk, and it wasn't a good thing to not have a monk in one's family. In the meanwhile, he also used to visit a painting shop (named \\"Special Painting House\\") where he enjoyed seeing how pictures were made and, in the same shop, he met a few painters. A Chinese painter taught him to draw black and white pictures with a black powder made from petroleum, while another painter who had studied at the Fine Arts University in Phnom Penh taught him to paint \\"all kinds of pictures\\".Huy Vannak (2010), p. 20 In 1963, he returned to his hometown - Kampong Cham - where he started to work for cinema theaters as a painter. His job was to paint the pictures for each movie. It soon earned him a good living, and he got married with Ma Yoeun. In 1968 he also ran a small painting shop in Chamkar Leu district of Kampong Cham province.Huy Vannak (2010), p. 21  Joining the revolution  On March 18, 1970 Prince Sihanouk was dethroned and Lon Nol took power of Cambodia. Cities and urban areas were controlled by Khmer Republic of Lon Nol, while the remaining areas were under the control of the Khmer Rouge.Huy Vannak (2010), p. 22 Short thereafter, an old friend of Bou Meng whose name was Nai and a man whose name was Chhon, asked him to join the revolution. Nai explained that it was about liberating both the country and Prince Sihanouk. Bou Meng was still unsure about what to do, but one day he heard on the radio Prince Sihanouk speaking from Beijing and appealing to the people to join the revolution. After hearing this, Bou Meng no longer hesitated to join the revolution and, in June 1971, he left his village with his wife and went to the jungle in order to help the revolutionaries. Bou Meng joined the revolution mainly because he wanted Prince Sihanouk to return to power.Huy Vannak (2010), pp. 24-25 On April 17, 1975 the Khmer Rouge managed to take control of Phnom Penh and the whole country, and everybody celebrated inside the compound where Bou Meng was working. Short thereafter, they were told to travel to Phnom Penh and, on their way, they saw many city dwellers heading towards the opposite direction. Many were sad and some children were crying because they couldn't find their parents. Bou Meng \\"felt strange about these scenes\\" and since then he started to realize that he had been cheated by the revolution.Huy Vannak (2010), pp. 29-30  Work in Phnom Penh and captivity in S-21  Once in Phnom Penh, Bou Meng was assigned to work inside the State Commercial Office, while his wife Ma Yoeun was assigned to work at a hospital. In 1976, he and his wife were assigned to work at another place, i.e. Rassey Keo Technical School, while their children were sent to a children's center.Huy Vannak (2010), pp. 30-32 Not long thereafter, Bou Meng and his wife were sent to the Ta-Lei cooperative, an agricultural working site where he had to work very hard \\"from dawn to dusk\\", the food wasn't enough and he was losing weight day by day. He also found out that Ta-Lei cooperative was a sort of detention center and this shocked him. They couldn't understand what mistake they had committed. He also noticed that people at Ta-Lei gradually disappeared and new people arrived every day. On August 16, 1977 two youths told Bou Meng that he was assigned to teach at the Fine Arts School of Phnom Penh and he was very happy about this, since he didn't have to work in that cooperative anymore. But after they departed, they noticed that it wasn't the right way to the Fine Arts School. They had been taken to a detention center, a building surrounded by barbed wire (S-21). Bou Meng told them that they had done nothing wrong, but the guard screamed at them that Angkar never makes mistakes.Huy Vannak (2010), pp. 32-35 Bou Meng described S-21 as \\"a hell on earth\\" (norauk lok kei).Huy Vannak (2010), p. 36  Torture  Bou Meng holding a copy of the \\"Duch\\" verdict Bou Meng was interrogated and tortured for weeks with electric shock, bamboo sticks whips, by poking his wounds and so on. Bou Meng once recalled that \\"they tortured me like an animal\\" and \\"my life was so miserable\\".Huy Vannak (2010), p. 41 Bou Meng always answered that he was innocent and that he had done nothing wrong, but the guards kept torturing him and asking him where he had met the CIA, KGB and \\"Yuon land swallowers\\" (i.e. the Vietnamese). Bou Meng didn't even know what CIA and KGB were. He finally fabricated confessions, hoping that they would stop torturing him. He said that he had joined the CIA at the pagoda with the monks and that he was asked to join the CIA by a pagoda boy. The guards also asked him about the CIA networks in the jungle, and he had to provide the names of 20 people he had met in that period.Huy Vannak (2010), p. 42  Painting propaganda pictures inside S-21  A few weeks after his interrogation started, two youths visited the cells in order to find prisoners who could paint portraits and pictures. Bou Meng told them that he could do the job. But they also warned him that he would be killed if the picture was not lifelike.Huy Vannak (2010), p. 43 Then Bou Meng was taken to the health clinic of the prison in order to heal his wounds, and he met Comrade Chief Duch. His treatment completely changed after being appointed as painter. He had to paint portraits of Pol Pot, Marx, and other propaganda pictures. He said: \\"Because of my painting skills, I was now treated less harshly\\". He was also in touch with other prisoners who had been granted special treatment because of his skill, and one of those was Vann Nath.Huy Vannak (2010), p. 44  Escape from S-21  The Vietnamese were getting closer and closer and, on January 7, 1979 Bou Meng and others were told to line up and they were walked to the exit gate of S-21. Bou Meng was scared, as he thought that his last day had come. They had to walk westward without being given food or water. They also passed Choeung Ek (the Killing Fields area) where they smelled a \\"stench of something like dead animals on the night breeze\\".Huy Vannak (2010), p. 51 At a certain point, they heard the tanks of the Vietnamese army getting closer and closer and four guards fled. The prisoners also managed to flee and, among those, also Bou Meng, who escaped northward with a friend. On their way, Bou Meng saw a lot of murdered people. They often found corpses lying dead and they took clothes from one of those, eating whatever they could find, such as fruit, roots and so on.Huy Vannak (2010), pp. 50-51 In 1981, Ung Pech, an ex-prisoner of S-21 (and one of only seven known adult survivors) who had become director of the museum, asked Bou Meng to come back to S-21. Bou Meng had never thought about coming back, but he saw it as an opportunity to recount the pain and fear he had suffered and let Cambodians and the whole world know.Huy Vannak (2010), pp. 54-55  See also  * Cambodian genocide * Cambodian genocide denial * Democratic Kampuchea * Chum Mey * John Dawson Dewhirst * Comrade Duch  References   Bibliography  * Category:Cambodian genocide survivors Category:Cambodian prisoners and detainees Category:Prisoners and detainees of Cambodia Category:Living people Category:1941 births ","title":"Bou Meng"},{"id":"57747536","text":"Berliner Woche (until September 2003: Berliner Wochenblatt/Hallo Berlin Wochenblatt) is a weekly advertising magazine in Berlin.

This was the first edition under the new schedule in which the PGA Championship is the second major of the year, having previously been the final one for decades. It was the third major and first PGA Championship at Bethpage Black, which hosted U.S. Opens in 2002 and 2009, won by Tiger Woods and Lucas Glover, respectively. Brooks Koepka won his second PGA Championship, and fourth major, by two strokes ahead of runner-up Dustin Johnson. By doing so he became first player to successfully defend both the PGA Championship and the U.S. Open in a career, and became fourth player to successfully defend two different majors in a career. At age 29 he became the only player currently under 30 to win at least four majors, and he returned to being ranked number one in the world. Johnson became the eighth player to have runner-ups in all four majors. Koepka hit a joint record PGA Championship low score of 63 in the first round, and a 65 in the second, to have the lowest 36-hole score in major history, and the largest 36-hole PGA Championship lead (7 strokes) in PGA Championship history. He hit a level par 70 in the third round, to retain a 7 stroke lead going into the final day. He held a healthy lead until a late charge from Johnson brought him within one stroke, but a four over par 74 was enough to get Koepka over the line. Given his recent win in the Masters, and his 2002 U.S. Open win at Bethpage, Tiger Woods had a lot of media attention leading into the tournament, but missed the cut. Given the length of the course, long hitters were expected to do well, and Koepka and Johnson were among the favorites. Rory McIlroy was also among the favorites but finished tied for eighth. After struggling recently for form, Jordan Spieth finished tied for third in his attempt to complete the career grand slam. The leading PGA Club Pro, and winner of his second Crystal Bowl, was Rob Labritz. He finished tied for 60th at 10-over-par.

He set a new record for the lowest 36-hole score in a major championship and his seven stroke lead over Adam Scott and Jordan Spieth also set a 36-hole PGA Championship record and was the largest at the halfway point of any major championship since Henry Cotton led by nine in the 1934 Open Championship. Scott was the only player to score lower than Koepka, with a round of 64 than included seven birdies in the first 14 holes and a bogey at the 17th. Danny Lee, in second place after the first round, dropped six shots in his first seven holes and finished with a round of 74. 82 players made the cut at 144, four strokes over par. Amongst those missing the cut were Masters champion Tiger Woods and world number 8 Bryson DeChambeau. Three PGA club professionals made the cut: Marty Jertson, Rob Labritz and Ryan Vermeer. This was the most since the number of qualifiers through the PGA Professional Championship was reduced from 25 to 20 in 2006. {  !Place!!Player!!Country!!Score!!To par - align=center1  Brooks Koepka   63-65=128  align=center−12 - rowspan=2 align=centerT2  Adam Scott   71-64=135  rowspan=2 align=center−5 - Jordan Spieth   69-66=135 - rowspan=5 align=centerT4  Daniel Berger   70-66=136  rowspan=5 align=center−4 - Dustin Johnson   69-67=136 - Kelly Kraft   71-65=136 - Luke List   68-68=136 - Matt Wallace   69-67=136 - align=center9  Justin Rose   70-67=137  align=center−3 - rowspan=9 align=centerT10  Tommy Fleetwood   67-71=138  rowspan=9 align=center−2 - Rickie Fowler   69-69=138 - Jazz Janewattananond   70-68=138 - Kang Sung-hoon   68-70=138 - Danny Lee   64-74=138 - Hideki Matsuyama   70-68=138 - Louis Oosthuizen   70-68=138 - Erik van Rooyen   70-68=138 - Harold Varner III   71-67=138 } : Third round Saturday, May 18, 2019 Brooks Koepka maintained his seven stroke lead after a level-par 70, a round that included three birdies and three bogeys.

When the Quadi deposed Furtius they elected Ariogaesus as their king, but Marcus Aurelius refused to renew the treaty and recognize their new ruler.

History Throughout 1939 and 1940 the British Armed Forces took delivery of 330 Leyland Hippo Mk Is. Also known as the WSW17, the Hippo Mk I was a militarised version of the pre-war Leyland Hippo truck with an open military cab and body. The Leyland Hippo Mk II was a new design by Leyland, developed as a result of the planning for D-Day, which concluded that trucks with cargo capacity offered considerable logistic advantages over smaller vehicles. Design of the Hippo Mk II commenced in 1943 with production commencing in late 1944. The Hippo Mk II arrived too late to see service in the days immediately after D-Day, but roughly 1,000 were in service by VE Day and they remained in service with the British Army and the Royal Air Force into the 1950s. Design The Leyland Hippo Mk II was a wheeled 6x4 truck, powered by a Leyland six-cylinder inline diesel engine, through a five-speed gearbox and two-speed auxiliary gearbox. The Hippo Mk II had a new two man enclosed steel cab with pull-down windows, the top portion of the cab could be removed to reduce the overall height for shipping. The Mk II was fitted with single tyres at the rear, the Mk IIA was fitted with narrower dual wheels at the rear, this necessitating the need to carry two spare tyres for the front and rear. The standard general service Hippo Mk II body was a steel framed, timber well type incorporating the wheel arches which reduced the loading height, an important consideration given most of the loading and unloading was done by hand. Steel hoops and a canvas cover gave weather protection and prevented identification of the load by the enemy. Some Hippo Mk IIs were fitted with large van bodies and several with expanding bodies. The sides on the latter were split horizontally, the top half expanding up to give greater roof coverage, the bottom half down to give greater floor space, multiple vehicles could be linked together to form a consolidated workshop area. Post- war bodies included a refueller.

Geography Mullaghdoo is bounded on the west by Drumlarah and Drummany townlands, on the east by Drumbinnis, Drumgoohy and Mackan townlands, on the south by Makief townland and on the north by Aghnacreevy townland. Its chief geographical features are Mullaghdoo Hill which rises to 334 feet, Mullaghdoo Lough, small streams and spring wells. Mullaghdoo is traversed by the regional R199 road (Ireland), minor public roads and rural lanes. The townland covers 272 acres. History The Ulster Plantation Baronial map of 1609 depicts the name as Mollaghdoue. A 1610 grant spells it as Molaghdone. A 1611 lease spells it as Nullaghdow. A 1630 inquisition spells the name as Mullaghduffe. The 1641 Depositions spell the name as Mullaighduffe. The 1652 Commonwealth Survey spells the townland as Mullaghduffe. From medieval times up to the early 1600s, the land belonged to the McKiernan Clan. In the Plantation of Ulster in 1609 the lands of the McKiernans were confiscated, but some were later regranted to them. In the Plantation of Ulster King James VI and I by grant dated 27 June 1610, granted the Manor of Keylagh, which included one poll in Molaghdone, to John Achmootie, a Scottish Groom of the Bedchamber. His brother Alexander Achmootie was granted the neighbouring Manor of Dromheada. On 29 July 1611 Arthur Chichester, 1st Baron Chichester and others reported that John Auchmothy and Alexander Auchmothye have not appeared at the lands awarded to them. James Craige is their deputy for five years, who has brought 4 artificers of divers sorts with their wives and families and 2 other servants. Stone raised for building a mill and trees felled, a walled house with a smith's forge built, 4 horses and mares upon the grounds with competent arms. On 1 May 1611 the aforesaid James Craig leased, inter alia, 1 poll of Nullaghdow to Corhonogho McKernan. Corhonogho McKernan must have sold his leasehold interest to his chief Brian McKiernan as on 14 March 1630, an Inquisition of King Charles I of England held in Cavan Town stated that Brian bane McKiernan (Brian Bán Mág Tighearnán, the chief of the McKiernan clan from 1588-1622) died on September 4, 1622, and his lands (probably a leasehold rather than the freehold) comprising seven poles and three pottles in Clonkeen, Clontygrigny, Cornacrum, Derrinlester, Dring townland, Killygorman, Kiltynaskellan and Mullaghdoo, Cavan went to his nearest relatives. The most likely inheritors being Cahill, son of Owen McKiernan; Brian, son of Turlough McKiernan and Farrell, son of Phelim McKiernan, all aged over 21 and married. In the Irish Rebellion of 1641 the rebels occupied the townland. In the 1641 Rebellion Depositions for County Cavan, Thomas Jones of Drumminnion townland and his son William Jones gave the names of rebel leaders in the Cavan Irish Rebellion of 1641, including, Farrell Og McKiernan of Mullaighduffe, Turlogh McFarrell McKiernan of same, Owen McFarrell McKiernan of same, Patrick McIlmartin of same and Hugh McIlmartin of same. Sir James Craig died in the siege of Croaghan Castle on 8 April 1642. His land was inherited by his brother John Craig of Craig Castle, County Cavan and of Craigston, County Leitrim, who was chief doctor to both King James I and Charles I. After the Irish Rebellion of 1641 concluded, the rebels vacated the land and the 1652 Commonwealth Survey lists the townland as belonging to Lewis Craig. In the Hearth Money Rolls compiled on 29 September 1663The Hearth Money Rolls for the Baronies of Tullyhunco and Tullyhaw, County Cavan, edited by Rev. Francis J. McKiernan, in Breifne Journal. Vol. I, No. 3 (1960), pp. 247-263 there were two Hearth Tax payers in Mullaghdufe- Brian McKernan and Derby Clancy. The 1790 Cavan Carvaghs list spells the townland name as Mullaghduff. In the 19th century the townland belonged to the Farnham Estate of Cavan. The estate papers are now in the National Library of Ireland and those papers mentioning Mullaghdoo are at reference numbers 21. F. 118/43; 21. F. 118/44 and 21. F. 118/45. In the 1825 Registry of Freeholders for County Cavan there was one freeholder registered in Mulladuff: Edward Martin. He was a Forty-shilling freeholders holding a lease for lives from his landlord, James S. Fleming. The Tithe Applotment Books for 1827 list nine tithepayers in the townland. The Mullaghdoo Valuation Office books are available for April 1838. Griffith's Valuation of 1857 lists ten landholders in the townland. Census {  - ! Year ! Population ! Males ! Females !

He built a tower and a chapel on some of his lands on the outskirts of Żejtun. The tower no longer exists, but St. Clement's Chapel remains intact and is still in use today. Biography Tabone was born in Casal Pasqualino (today part of Żejtun) in around 1575 to Pietro Tabone and Dorothea née Cumbo. He was the only son within a rich family, and he had six sisters. On 18 March 1589, he seems to have received a clerical tonsure which brought him under the Church's jurisdiction, protecting him from the powers of the Order of St. John who at the time ruled Malta. Tabone did not continue to study to become a priest. He acted as an attorney for his father during a property deal in 1596, and his father later gave him some pieces of land through two notarial deeds. He subsequently became a wealthy landowner, renting out some of his fields and buying others. His lands included a number of fields and buildings, including part of the archaeological site of Tas-Silġ and salt pans in Bengħisa. Tabone built the Ingraw Tower on one of his lands in 1603, and decades later, he used part of the land acquired in 1596 to construct St. Clement's Chapel. Tabone married three times. He first married Helena Testaferrata on 11 January 1597 in Birgu, but she died the following year on 2 August 1598. His second marriage was to Margherita Pace, the daughter of a nobleman from Siġġiewi, and they married on 3 February 1602. He eventually began an extramarital affair with Aloisetta Veron, and he married her on 14 January 1657. They had four children, two of whom – Dorothea and Angelo (or Archangelo) – were born out of wedlock and later legitimized. Their fourth child, Archangela, was born after Clemente's death. Tabone and his family had moved to Birgu by 1609, but he seems to have also returned to Żejtun at some points in his later life. He made wills in 1646, 1659 and finally in 1661. He died in Birgu on 11 March 1665, and was buried in the Parish Church of St. Lawrence. His son Angelo died a day after him. Tabone had an Ethiopian servant named Gregorio in 1646. In his later life, he had at least two black slaves, Gugliemo and Madalena, who were eventually set free. Raid of 1614 Clemente Tabone is mostly known for his role in the 1614 Raid on Żejtun, in which a fleet of Ottoman galleys landed some 6,000 men in St. Thomas Bay in Marsaskala and pillaged the village of Żejtun which had been abandoned by its inhabitants after they heard about the attack. Tabone's exact role is unclear; some sources state that he was a member of the dejma militia, while others state that he was attacked by Ottomans on the outskirts of Żejtun. He might have lost his sword during this fight. 18th-century sources state that Tabone showed a lot of courage during the 1614 raid, but no direct contemporary sources which state Tabone's exact role are known. Tabone might have been part of the dejma that responded to the cannon fire from St. Lucian Tower after the Ottomans' failed attempt to land at Marsaxlokk, or he might have been part of the cavalry force that drove the invaders out of Żejtun. Buildings House in Żejtun The house which probably belonged to the Tabone family Tabone was given a house in Żejtun by his father in 1596. It is described in contemporary documents as consisting of rooms built around a courtyard, also containing a cistern, a small adjoining field and half of a tower (the other half of this tower seems to have belonged to the heirs of Tabone's uncle). The house at 40, St. Clement's Street has traditionally been considered to be Tabone's house. It contains a courtyard, cistern and a nearby field, matching the description, and the date \\"1624\\" is reportedly inscribed inside the building. However, no sources which explicitly state that the building belonged to Tabone are known, and his ownership of the building is therefore uncertain. The design of the house is similar to the auberges of the Knights in Birgu. It has a main door in the middle with an imposing window decorated with a local Melitan moulding. The building has other entrances and windows at ground floor but are simple. The upper floor is mostly not built. Ingraw Tower A rural structure built from reused stonework of the Ingraw Tower, with the date 1603 and the coat-of-arms of the Tabone family. The Ingraw Tower () was built by Tabone in 1603 in Ħal Tmin or in the area of Misraħ Strejnu. It bore the following inscription, but it has been lost: The tower was built for defensive purposes since the area was prone to attacks by the Barbary pirates. A number of other towers were built in the area, including Tal-Mozz Tower in the immediate vicinity and Mamo Tower some distance away. The Ingraw Tower had been dismantled by 1927, and its stonework was used to build a nearby rural structure. A stone bearing the date \\"1603\\" and another bearing the coat of arms of the Tabone family can still be seen in the room's façade. St. Clement's Chapel St. Clement's Chapel Tabone had first made plans to construct a chapel in the 1620s, but when he described the wish to be buried in this chapel in his 1646 will, it is mentioned that the building was still to be constructed. Located in Ħal Tmin, the chapel is believed to have been built in 1658, since that date is inscribed on its façade beneath Tabone's coat of arms. It was described as complete in 1661. An inscription above the main doorway of the chapel reads: It is often stated that the chapel was built to commemorate deliverance from the 1614 attack, but a definite link between the raid and the chapel has not yet been established. The church has a simple façade and a small parvis. Pope Clement I is the subject of the chapel's titular painting, which was painted in 1662 and is attributed to Stefano Erardi. The painting contains a depiction of an elderly Tabone. A small painting depicting the Pietà, attributed to Francesco Zahra, is also found in the chapel. The chapel remains intact and it is still in use.

Mohler, who has an amateur interest in the subject rather than an academic background, created the comic in December 2013 in an attempt to help popularize philosophy through comedy. The comic tends to depict philosophers of different backgrounds and often has them interacting and arguing with each other. It also gives textual descriptions of the jokes and associated philosophy to help educate readers. In May 2018 Mohler once called Elon Musk \\"the villain from Atlas Shrugged\\". Musk responded during SpaceX's launch of a Falcon 9 rocket. Mohler later published a comic about the incident.  Philosophers  existentialists are often featured in the comic. The four here, Søren Kierkegaard, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Friedrich Nietzsche, and Jean-Paul Sartre, have all been featured multiple times. The comic has covered over 120 philosophers, examining a wide variety of thought from Pre-Socratic philosophy to contemporary philosophy. Mohler has described both Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir as his favorite philosophers. Alongside existentialism, Mohler has also written extensively about Stoicism and communism.

Gadney was also an officer in the Coldstream Guards in the 1960s and later wrote the biopic screenplay Goldeneye (about author Ian Fleming) which was filmed in 1989 with Charles Dance playing Ian Fleming. Gadney cameoed as the real-life James Bond, the man who lent his name to Fleming's eponymous spy. Life Gadney, the son of the rugby player, Bernard Gadney, was born during a secondary air raid on 20 January 1941. His was father was the headmaster at Malsis School in Cross Hills, West Riding of Yorkshire, and Gadney was born in Dorm 10 in the school when Luftwaffe bombers, returning across the Pennines from a raid in either Liverpool or Manchester, dumped their surplus fuel on the cricket pitch. Gadney was encouraged to paint by his mother, but his early years were entrusted to a German nanny until wartime regulations saw her interned as an \\"undesirable alien.\\" Gadney attended Dragon School in Oxford and then Stowe in Buckinghamshire before being commissioned into the Coldstream Guards where he formed a lasting friendship with Simon Parker- Bowles. Gadney often joked about his time in the army, stating that it was suggested that it would make a man out of him; Gadney always said that it failed to do that. Whilst in the army, Gadney served in Libya, France and Norway, the latter post saw him working as an attache and he also qualified as an instructor in winter warfare and Arctic survival. His friendship with Parker-Bowles continued throughout their lives, despite them often not living close to one another. Memorably, on one Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace, watched by a temporarily crippled Queen Mother, Gadney gave the wrong order and instead of swapping over guards they all marched away at the same time leaving no guard behind. The commander was apoplectic and gave both Gadney and Parker-Bowles a dressing down, but Gadney and Parker-Bowles later received a message from the Queen Mother that stated \\"...how terribly nice it was to see the ceremony done differently.\\" After leaving the army, Gadney attended St Catharine's College, Cambridge and then won a scholarship to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He later taught at the Royal College of Art becoming a Fellow and Pro-Rector. He also worked as the deputy controller of the National Film Theatre. Gadney won a BAFTA in 1983 for his seven-part television serial about John F. Kennedy starring Martin Sheen. In 1989, Gadney's screenplay \\"Goldeneye\\", a biopic of author Ian Fleming, was shot on location in the Caribbean with Charles Dance playing Fleming. One of Gadney's stipulations was that it should be part filmed in the Caribbean so that he could get a free holiday out of it. It was Dance's suggestion that Gadney play the real-life character of James Bond, who, in the screenplay, Fleming found birdwatching on his Jamaican estate.In real life, Fleming had met Bond before and owned one of his books, even going so far as writing to Bond to ask his permission to name his fictional spy after the ornithologist. Fleming took the man's name for his fictional character of James Bond. Gadney used to tell people he was the fifth James Bond who he portrayed between Timothy Dalton and Pierce Brosnan. He also adapted Iris Murdoch's novel \\"The Bell\\" and Minette Walters' novel \\"The Sculptress\\" for television. He died of pancreatic cancer in early May 2018 and his funeral was held on 22 May 2018 at St Marylebone Parish Church. Personal life Gadney was married twice; firstly to Annette Kobak and secondly to the restaurant critic Fay Maschler, who he met at a party in 1992. He had two children from his first marriage and three step children from his marriage to Maschler. Works Gadney became a full-time writer in 1984, but he still painted, especially portraits in his later life, people he knew personally.

Eggert rejected all accusations, requested an investigation and later filed a complaint himself, which was not pursued further by the Public prosecutor's office, since there was no justified initial suspicion.

He had a tendency to break blood vessels and was plagued by injury throughout his career which limited his racecourse appearances. He was physically strong in appearance though often sweated up before his races. He was trained throughout his career by Richard Head at Rhonehurst Stables, in Upper Lambourn, Berkshire, England.  Background  Foaled in 1970, Border Incident was sired by the very useful flat middle distance runner Border Chief, who became a successful National Hunt sire. Border Incident's dam Cuddle Up, was a point-to-point winner.Chasers & Hurdlers 1975/76 A Timeform Publication Portway Press Ltd  1974/75 Season  Border Incident made three appearances in his first season, winning on each occasion with John Francome in the saddle. All the runs came in novice hurdle company. After comfortable victories at Newbury in November and Chepstow the following month, he started favourite for the prestigious Panama Cigar Hurdle Final at Chepstow in March. The Raceform representative at the course returned the following comments for the run; ‘Jumped well, always prominent, led two out, soon clear.’ Raceform Up-To-Date Form Book National Hunt Annual 1974/75 Published by Raceform Ltd  1975/76 Season  Border Incident was limited to two appearances during this campaign. On his first outing in the SGB Hire Shop Hurdle at Ascot in December, he appeared to be travelling well but dropped suddenly out of contention to finish unplaced behind Grand Canyon. On his final start in February, he was switched to fences and was not troubled to beat inferior opposition in a novice chase at Windsor. The Timeform organisation went on record as stating that his affliction to break blood vessels looked likely to hinder his career, adding that after he had won the Panama Cigar Hurdle Final during the previous season, he was in their opinion the most promising novice since Bula.  1976/77 Season  Border Incident won three of his five starts during this season, developing into a high class chaser. He opened up his campaign by making all the running to beat Fred Winter’s highly touted Snow Flyer over two and a half miles at Ascot in October. He then dropped back to two miles for the Black & White Whisky Gold Cup at the same venue in November. He ran a meritable race in defeat, in front jumping the last fence but being unable to match the pace of Tree Tangle on the run in. Border Incident next appeared in the Old Year Chase at Cheltenham during the Christmas period where he was conceding weight to seasoned performers. He disappointed in finishing unplaced behind his stable companion Uncle Bing, but made a mistake at the third last and had his chance further compromised when hampered by a faller at the next fence. In January, Border Incident lined up for the prestigious Embassy Premier Chase Final, run over two and a half miles at Haydock Park. With Ron Barry taking over in the saddle, Border Incident faced eight opponents which included the promising Irish trained runners Bunker Hill and Tied Cottage, future Grand National winner Lucius, Master H and Zongalero. Starting the 2/1 favourite, Border Incident was this time held up as the front running Tied Cottage set a strong pace. Approaching two fences from home, Bunker Hill had taken up the running but was being pressed by Border Incident who soon went to the front, jumped the final fence ahead, opened up a three length lead and maintained his advantage. Bunker Hill, Master H and Tied Cottage followed him home. The Cheltenham Gold Cup was now his intended target and in what was designed to be his preparation race, Border Incident lined up for the three mile one furlong Jim Ford Challenge Cup at Wincanton. After being held up in the early stages he came through to win by six length from Summerville. Border Incident was quoted as short as 6/1 in the Cheltenham Gold Cup ante-post betting after Wincanton but suffered a bout of sore shins and did not appear again. He ended the season with a Timeform rating of 159. The eventual Cheltenham Gold Cup winner Davy Lad ended the season on 151. Timeform’s highest rated staying chaser of the season was Bannow Rambler on 163.Chasers & Hurdlers 1976/77 A Timeform Publication Portway Press Ltd  1977/78 Season  This season for Border Incident was limited to a single appearance. This came at Wincanton in October where he was not troubled to beat the 1976 Cheltenham Gold Cup winner Royal Frolic by a length and a half. He evidently suffered a training setback soon after. He ended the season with a Timeform rating of 157 ?, the question mark symbol indicating that there was not enough evidence for them to be confident that the rating was sufficiently accurate.Chasers & Hurdlers 1977/78 A Timeform Publication Portway Press Ltd  1978/79 Season  Border Incident again appeared only once. This came in the Welsh Champion Chase over two and a half miles at Chepstow in the spring, after an absence of almost a year and a half from the racecourse. Facing three rivals, he quickened up on the run in under John Francome to beat Young Arthur by half a length. The outcome of the race may have been changed when the former top class hurdler Dramatist, who started the odds on favourite, fell when challenging for the lead at the final fence. Border Incident ended the season with a Timeform rating of 140 +, the symbol indicating that the horse was probably much better than they were able to rate him.Chasers & Hurdlers 1978/79 A Timeform Publication Portway Press Ltd  1979/80 Season  Border Incident ran on five occasions during this campaign, winning twice. He reappeared in the three runner Edward Hanmer Memorial Chase at Haydock Park, looking to face a stiff task against Silver Buck and Night Nurse . Ridden by John Francome, Border Incident was in the process of running an encouraging race, close up in third place, when falling at the second last. His next race came on Boxing Day when he lined up with Ron Barry aboard for the King George VI Chase at Kempton Park. Despite facing the most difficult task of his career so far, Border Incident started third favourite at 9/2. Border Incident began to struggle in the home straight and eventually finished third, twenty lengths behind Silver Buck and Jack Of Trumps, giving the impression that he may not have stayed the three mile trip in a fast run race. Border Incident remained at three miles for his next two races. He won both times, though he faced two rivals on both occasions and the events were not run at a true pace. The first of those races was the Fulwell Chase at Kempton in January where, under Ron Barry, he beat the Peter Easterby trained King Weasel by seven lengths. The follow up victory came in the Fairlawne Chase at Windsor in February. With John Francome in the saddle, he made all the running to beat Cavity Hunter and the former King George V1 Chase winner, Bachelor’s Hall. Border Incident’s final start of the season came in the Cheltenham Gold Cup which was run in heavy ground. Border Incident started third favourite in the betting at 6/1, behind Diamond Edge and Jack Of Trumps. He unseated John Francome six fences from home when travelling easily in fourth place. Border Incident ended the season with a Timeform Rating of 160, the highest he would achieve in his career. This was 11 lb behind the organisation’s top rated staying chaser of the season, Silver Buck on 171.Chasers & Hurdlers 1979/80 A Timeform Publication Portway Press Ltd  1980/81 Season  Border Incident was seen just twice during this campaign, winning on one occasion. In the two and a half mile Peterborough Chase at Huntingdon in December, he started the odds on favourite but was stretched to the limit under Ron Barry to beat Royal Charley by half a length. He then incurred a leg injury which caused him to miss the King George V1 Chase. His final appearance of the campaign was in the eight runner Tote Pattern Handicap Chase run over three miles at Kempton in February. This was intended to be Border Incident’s warm up race for the Cheltenham Gold Cup but after looking to be travelling strongly, he dropped away quickly and was pulled up by John Francome before the fourth last. The Raceform representative at the course, John Sharratt, wrote that Border Incident, ‘... looks a mere shadow of the horse he once promised to be.’ \\".Chaseform Note Book 1980/1981 Published by Raceform Ltd Border Incident ended the season with a Timeform rating of 156.  1981/82 Season  Starting the season as an eleven year old, Border Incident appeared five times, winning once. He made his seasonal debut in a ten runner handicap chase at Wincanton at the end of November. Carrying top weight of 12 stone 7 pounds, he failed by two lengths to overhaul Glen Berg who was receiving a considerable amount of weight. John Sharratt, reporting for Raceform, wrote, ‘ Border Incident was turned out looking a picture and given a peach of a ride by Francome, ran remarkably well and, bar one minor error, jumped as if he had never been off the racecourse.’ \\".Chaseform Note Book 1981/1982 Published by Raceform Ltd The next race chosen for Border Incident was the Freshfields Holidays Handicap Chase at Sandown in February. Run over a distance of three miles, the field included the top class Night Nurse, and the rapidly progressing future Cheltenham Gold Cup winner, Bregawn. Starting the 5/1 third favourite, Border Incident began to drop out of contention a long way from the finish and was pulled up by John Francome before the final fence, the race being won by Bregawn. The combination failed to complete the course again on the next outing, which came in the Jim Ford Challenge Cup at Wincanton. After looking to be travelling easily, Border Incident dropped away quickly and was pulled up before the third last. Border Incident next appeared in a four runner handicap chase at Newbury in the first week of March. Dropping back to a distance of two miles and with Peter Scudamore in the saddle for the first time, Border Incident was not troubled to beat inferior opposition easily. The 1982 Cheltenham Gold cup would be the final run of Border Incident’s career. Starting at 33/1, he never got involved in the race and was eventually pulled up by John Francome. Border Incident ended his final season with a Timeform rating of 142 ?, the symbol implying that the figure was one not given with confidence.Chasers & Hurdlers 1981/82 A Timeform Publication Portway Press Ltd  References  Category:1970 racehorse births Category:National Hunt racehorses ","title":"Border Incident (horse)"},{"id":"57748208","text":"Stefan Stoykov (, 28 January 1938 - 12 April 2013) was a Bulgarian basketball player.

Edwin de Leon and Thomas Cooper de Leon were his brothers. He received the M.D. degree from the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia (where his parents had lived before moving to South Carolina) in 1836. He entered the Army in 1838 as Assistant Surgeon and \\"served with distinction in the Seminole war\\". At the beginning of the Mexican War, he went with General Zachary Taylor to the Rio Grande, was present at most of the battles in the campaign toward Mexico, and entered that city when it surrendered. At the battle of Chapultepec he earned the sobriquet of \\"the Fighting Doctor,\\" as on two occasions led a charge of cavalry after the officer commanding had been killed or wounded. For his distinguished services and for his gallantry in action he twice received the thanks of Congress. He was then assigned to frontier duty, and in 1856 he became surgeon, with the rank of major. Like most Southern officers in the regular Army, he resigned his commission at the outbreak of the Civil War, forfeiting his opportunity to become U.S. surgeon-general. He was appointed by Jefferson Davis as the head of the Confederacy's medical department, and shortly thereafter acting surgeon-general of the Confederacy.

Die Gegenwärtigkeit des Nationalsozialismus in biographischen Rekonstruktionen von Kerntechnik-Experten (Nuclear Technology and German Biographies: The Presence of National Socialism in Biographical Reconstructions of Nuclear Experts) was published by Psychosozial-Verlag. From 2006 until 2011, she was junior research group leader of the DFG project Zum Wandel von Arbeit durch computerisiertes Wissen im Operationssaal aus der Geschlechterperspektive (The Effect of Computerized Knowledge in the Operating Room from a Gender Perspective), which Kissmann acquired independently. In 2013, she completed her habilitation at the Philosophical Faculty III of Humboldt University in Berlin, receiving a Venia Legendi in Sociology. Klaus Eder and Hubert Knoblauch were the reviewers of her habilitation thesis entitled Die Sozialität des Visuellen. Fundierung der hermeneutischen Videoanalyse und materiale Untersuchungen (The Sociality of the Visual. The Establishment of Video Hermeneutics and Material Analyses). The monograph was published in 2014 by Velbrück Wissenschaft. From the winter semester 2012/13 until the end of the winter semester 2014/15, Kissmann was interim professor of Process- Oriented Sociology at the Catholic University of Eichstätt-Ingolstadt. In March 2015, she was appointed full Professor for Sociological Methodology of Qualitative Reconstructive Research at the University of Kassel.  Research  Kissmann's research focuses on the interpretive paradigm of Alfred Schütz and its further development. With reference to Maurice Merleau-Ponty, she has made other forms of intentionality such as fleshly habituality fruitful for phenomenology, moving beyond the classic model of interaction with two human actors, limited to their content of consciousness. On this basis, Kissmann has developed a methodology and method for video hermeneutics that take into account the special content of visual-bodily behavior in natural situations. With her work, she brings Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology of the subjective body into hermeneutics of sociology of knowledge and expands the classic model of action. As Director of the Center of Empirical Research Methods at the University of Kassel she has fostered qualitative research methods within empirical social research. And as Vice-President and President of the Research Network 20, Qualitative Methods of the European Sociological Association Kissmann has contributed to the discussion on the state and future of qualitative methods.

The show went Off-Air on 10 November 2018. The series explores the captivating tale of Shiva’s life, his infinite love for Sati, his grief over her loss, his timeless union with Parvati and his legend as the fearsome destroyer of evil. The show is an enigmatic portrayal of the Lord of the Universe – Shiva. It is a gripping portrayal of the historical stories around Shiva and delves into several lesser-known stories and legends around him. The show begins with the buildup to the epic battle between Shiva and Jalandhara as has been mentioned in the Shiva Puran. The storytelling is complemented by the expertise of the renowned consultant – Nrisingha Prasad Bhaduri and eminent artist Rupchand Kundu has been roped in creative visualization of the show-universe. Mahadev is played by Gaurav Mondal while Neha Amandeep plays Sati and Sriparna Roy portrays the character of Parvati.  Plot  The story follows Shiva, the Protector and the Destroyer, the Peaceful and the Fierce. Shiva is portrayed as a family man uninfluenced by mortal allures and pleasures. Om Namoh Shivay starts with Dakshya, the son of Brahma, being introduced as the greatest Prajapati on earth. Asur Raj (King of the Asuras) Jalandhar attacks his kingdom and starts wreaking havoc. After Dakshya’s failure to stop Jalandhar, all Gods and humans start praying to Shiva who punishes Jalandhar and saves the world. This infuriates Dakshya who denies Shiva’s supremacy. Brahma prays to Mahamaya for help to domesticate Shiva. She takes a mortal birth as Sati, daughter of Dakshya and becomes an ardent worshipper of Shiva. Dakshay cannot tolerate Sati’s dedication and decides to teach young Sati a lesson by imprisoning her. However, Shiva starts playing mridangam and magically rescues Sati. Dakshya gets further infuriated and throws out all Shiva followers from Dakshya Rajya. They are rescued by Shiva who gives them food and shelter. Rishi Durvasa, the son of Atri and Anasuya comes to Dakshya Rajya and Sati pleases him with the help of Shiva’s magic. Durvasa blesses Sati for her devotion and says that one day she would become the wife of Shiva. However, arrogant Dakshya insults Durvasa and the infuriated rishi curses the Prajapati.

Description Andrena bicolor is a small to medium-sized mining bee, with the males being slightly smaller than the females. The females have a coat of reddish-brown hairs on the dorsal surface of the thorax, a wholly black-haired face and indistinct bands of yellowish hairs on the margins of the first to third tergites. The spring brood can show an extensive black hair covering on the femur and the sides of the thorax, this is not as marked in the autumn brood. It has dark tibia on the hind legs but these have obvious orange hairs which have been said to resemble a pair of orange leg warmers. The spring brood males have black hairs on the head and side of the thorax and lack the bright colours of the females, while summer brood males often show brown hairs on the face and have no black hairs on the side of the thorax. Distribution Andrena bicolor is a widely distributed species in Europe from most of Great Britain and Ireland in the west to southern Fennoscandia south to the Mediterraean, including Corsica, the Balearic Islands, Sicily, Crete and Cyprus but it is not found on Sardinia, its range extends east into Russia and Central Asia. It has also been recorded in Turkey, Israel and Iran. In the Netherlands this species is commoner in the south than in the north but it seems to be expanding its range in the north. Habitat and ecology Andrena bicolor shows a rather generalist choice of habitat from calcareous grassland to open woodlands, only avoiding closed canopy woodland and high alpine habitats. In some parts of its distribution it can be a coastal species such as in Ireland and parts of Scotland. In the Alps it extends to in Switzerland but has been recorded up to in Austria. It has two broods during a season, i.e. it is bivoltine, a spring brood which flies from March to June and a summer brood which flies from June to late August. The first brood is much more numerous than the second brood, and the second brood appears to be much more elusive than the first, especially the males. A. bicolor is polylectic, meaning that it feeds from a wide variety of flowers. This has been shown by sampling the pollen collected by females. The spring brood has been confirmed as foraging on a wide variety of early flowering plants from low herbaceaous species such as coltsfoot (Tussilago farfara), Bellis perennis, dandelion (Taraxacum spp), buttercups (Ranunculus spp), daffodils (Narcissus spp.) and bluebells (Hyacinthoides spp) to spring blossoming shrubs such as hawthorn (Crataegus spp) and willow (Salix spp.).. However, the summer brood females feed mainly from bell flowers, in particular the harebell (Campanula rotundifolia) and the clustered bellflower (Campanula glomerata) as well as such species as white bryony (Bryonia alba), blackberry (Rubus spp.), mallows, cranesbills and cinquefoils. In the Ukraine A. bicolor is regarded as one of the most important pollinators of the cherry crop. The nest tunnel may be over in length and nests can be solitary or in small loose aggregations which are normally on relatively bare ground on south facing banks or slopes. In Germany nests have been found in association with the nests of other Andrena species such as Andrena fulva and species of the Andrena minutula complex. Nests are rarely recorded and are difficult to locate. The cleptoparasitic nomad bee Nomada fabriciana is associated with A. bicolor and the fly Stylops gwynanae may \\"stylopise\\" A. bicolor in Spain and eastern Europe and larval Stylops have been observed on adult A. bicolor.

It can also be referred to as HuCAL antibody, HuCAL standing for Human Combinatorial Antibody Library and being a technology used to generate monoclonal antibodies. Otilimab is directed against the granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), a monomeric glycoprotein functioning as a cytokine promoting both proliferation and activation of macrophages and neutrophils.  Mode of action  Schematic diagram of an antibody and antigens. In the given case, otilimab is the antibody and binds monospecifically to GM-CSF (corresponding to the fitting yellow bit on this image). Otilimab, as its monoclonal antibody, specifically binds to GM-CSF which is consequently neutralised and incapable of binding its targeted inflammatory cells as it should in order to allow their proliferation and activation. There is no following induction of inflammation (through cytokines e.g. TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6), chemotaxis (via chemokines e.g. IL-8), tissue degradation (caused by e.g. MMPs, H2O2) or T and B cell response (following up-regulated MHC II level).  Medical uses  Beyond its role in natural immune pathways, GM-CSF has been shown to be involved in autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in which cases GM-CSF levels are elevated and mediate an increased production of pro- inflammatory elements (cytokines, chemokines, proteases). The factor is also known to be involved in osteoarthritis of the hand. Research has thus been working on it as a molecular target for the treatment of such disorders, notably through immunotherapy such as monoclonal antibody therapy which is known to be efficient against autoimmune diseases.  Rheumatoid arthritis  There already exist treatments of rheumatoid arthritis through monoclonal antibodies (i.e. infliximab, adalimumab). These drugs are not targeting GM-CSF but TNF-α which is another cytokine involved in the disease. However, the major involvement of TNF-α in immunity makes its suppression delicate: it diminishes the immune defenses of treated patients against potential new infections and may allow the reactivation of latent ones such as hepatitis B and tuberculosis. The number of reported cases of severe side effects, including fatal ones, has led the FDA to instruct tight monitoring of patients before and during a treatment by TNF-inhibiting drugs. Nevertheless, another way to circumvent such outcomes may be to target an alternate cytokine.  Multiple sclerosis  In multiple sclerosis (MS), GM-CSF is produced by T helper cells (Th1 and Th17). It is able to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and bind to CD52 on macrophages surface. Along with other pro-inflammatory events, this will participate in the central nervous system (CNS) inflammation process typically occurring in MS. There are numerous existing monoclonal antibodies used in the treatment of multiple sclerosis: natalizumab (targets α4-integrin), daclizumab and alemtuzumab (both binding to CD25, the α-subunit of IL-2 receptor on the surface of mature lymphocytes), ocrelizumab (against CD20 marker on B-cells). However, the frequent adverse effects notified, including secondary autoimmune phenomena, suggest that the uncovering of a new molecular target for monoclonal antibody therapy would be welcomed in the research for an improved treatment against MS. Otilimab is currently undergoing clinical trials to determine whether it could be used as treatment and has so far shown to be generally well tolerated by both relapsing- remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) patients. Indeed, most TEAEs (treatment-emergent adverse events) which were observed were mild to moderate. There isn't evidence of immunogenecity either: no anti-otilimab antibodies were detected in patients following treatment. These results provide Class I evidence in regards to acceptable tolerance in MS patients and reveal that otilimab remains a fitted candidate for the treatment of multiple sclerosis  References  Category:Monoclonal antibodies Category:Arthritis ","title":"Otilimab"},{"id":"57748671","text":"The Phapant dwarf gecko (Hemiphyllodactylus tonywhitteni) is a species of gecko.

They belonged to the Jains. The caves are generally dated to the 3rd or 4th century CE, based on the dedicatory inscription found in the largest cave which uses Gupta script of the 4th century CE, although some authors have suggested the caves could actually go back to the period of the Maurya empire from 319 to 180 BCE. The main cave is rectangular with a pointed ceiling, and the entrance is trapezoidal, reminiscent of the structure of the Barabar Caves (the first artificial caves of India, dated the 3rd century BCE).Gupta, The roots of Indian Art, B. R. Publishing Corporation, Delhi, 1980 The quality of the \\"Mauryan polish\\" and the finish are nevertheless much inferior. The stone of Son Bhandar is also much less hard than the granite of the Barabar caves, and therefore did not require the same degree of effort and technique.  Dedicatory inscription of the 4th century CE An inscription in the rock at the entrance of the cave in Gupta characters of the 4th century of our era mentions the construction of the cellar by a Jain Muni (\\"wise man\\") named Vairadeva. This inscription naturally led to date the cave to the same period of the 4th century CE.: Original inscription in Gupta script.Cunningham, Four Reports Made Durning The Years 1862-65 Vol.1 According to Gupta, however, this inscription may be ambiguous and, for him, might only mean that the cave was the subject of re- development work at that time. For this reason, he tends to date the cave on the basis of its similarities with the caves of Barabar (general shape, trapezoidal entrance door, polishing, although extremely limited) to the time of Ashoka (260 BCE), or even a little earlier, making it the possible precursor of all artificial caves in India such as the Barabar Caves. Le Huu Phuoc also entertains the possibility, to challenge the traditional idea that stone mirror-polishing techniques were imported from the Near East.Buddhist Architecture, Grafikol 2009, Le Huu Phuoc, p.45 The consensus, however, favours the traditional datation of 2nd to 4th century of our era, based on the epigraphic evidence.

Early life Veary was a child prodigy, singing in church before she was old enough to go to school. Her early role models were sopranos Deanna Durbin and Jeanette MacDonald. Her parents, both of Hawaiian ancestry, encouraged her, but did not have the financial means to provide her with musical training. She was put on a career path by teacher Irmgard (Gardie) Thompson, leading to her singing on the radio and receiving favorable recognition. At age 10, she was profiled in The Honolulu Advertiser, resulting in a music scholarship at Punahou School.; ; During World War II, she was a USO performer while enrolled at Kamehameha School For Girls, and joined with musicians such as John Kameaaloha Almeida to entertain the troops at Hawaii military installations.; Opera training and Broadway influence As a teenager, Veary was sent to New York City to be trained at Carnegie Hall as a lyric Coloratura soprano . While there, she was exposed to the Broadway theatre productions of that era, and aspired to expand her repertoire to be inclusive of multiple forms of vocal expression. Upon her return home, Veary appeared one evening a week on radio station KGMB with Andy Cummings. She enrolled at Roosevelt High School, graduating in 1949, subsequently enrolling in the University of Hawaii as a music major. In 1951, she married United States Navy aviator Robert Moss and moved with him to California. For the next several years, she raised her two daughters and performed in stage productions, occasionally returning to Hawaii. Veary divorced in 1963 and moved to New York to resume her career in stage musicals. Return to Hawaii In the 1960s, Veary returned to live in Hawaii, marrying local radio personality J. Akuhead Pupule, and becoming a staple in local stage productions and Waikiki hotel showrooms.; In a 1966 stage production of Flower Drum Song, Veary assumed the role of Helen Chao, with James Shigeta, Miyoshi Umeki and Jack Soo reprising their movie roles. When reviewing her show at the Coral Terrace of the Halekulani on the beach at Waikiki, The Honolulu Advertiser entertainment editor Wayne Harada referred to her as, \\"a diamond in the proper setting.\\" In 1980, Veary was still associated with the Halekulani and married to businessman Richard Ireland.

He was a member of the Society of Jesus. When all its institutions were closed due to the Jesuits Law of 1872, he left Germany. He returned in 1882 and worked as a hymnologist. Mohr published several hymnals, promoting the return of Gregorian chant in Latin to the church liturgy, but writing German hymns intended for events beyond mass, such as processions. He is known for his hymn \\"Ein Haus voll Glorie schauet\\" which follows models of military marches. It appears in modern hymnals, however with modified text.  Career  Mohr was born in Siegburg, where his father was a teacher at the elementary school. He studied philosophy and theology at the Bonn University from 1852. In 1853, he became a member of the Society of Jesus in Münster. After the completion of his studies, he taught at the order's college in Feldkirch until 1862. From 1863, he studied rhetoric in Munich and theology in Maria Laach. He was consecrated as a priest in 1866. Ein Haus voll Glorie\\", Mohr's original text and melody The Jesuits were restricted during the Kulturkampf by the Jesuits Law of 1872. As all Jesuit institutions in Germany were dissolved, Mohr left Germany for Jesuit societies in France and Belgium. During this time, he wrote text and melody of his hymn \\"Ein Haus voll Glorie schauet\\". In his hometown, tradition has it that he was inspired by the Abbey on top of a mountain, overlooking the region. Its melody, especially its rhythm, is influenced by military marches. His best- known hymn, it is part of modern hymnals, but only the first of his seven stanzas was included in the Catholic hymnal Gotteslob of 1975, with four new stanzas by Hans W. Marx. Mohr considered the \\"Schönheit des Gregorianischen Chorals\\" (beauty of Gregorian chant as the appropriate music for the celebration of mass. He joined an association for its studies, the Verein zur Erforschung alter Choralhandschriften behufs Wiederherstellung des cantus S. Gregorii of the music director at the Trier Cathedral, . The association fostered the restoration of Gregorian singing in Germany, with members such as Robert Eitner, François-Auguste Gevaert, and Joseph Pothier. Mohr recommended congregational singing for other church events, such as meditation (Andacht) and processions, and wrote a handbook to improve the quality of singing. He composed the melody of \\"\\" which is preferred in the Rhineland, a new melody of Christoph Bernhard Verspoell's \\"Dir jubeln Engelchöre\\", and a new melody of 's \\"Heilig bist du, großer Gott\\", which appear in the Catholic hymnal. As the Jesuits Law was still in effect, he left the Society of Jesus in order to return to Germany in 1882. He worked as a hymnologist in Cologne, Regensburg, and finally in Munich until his death.

Music and lyrics \\"Harvest\\" is a slow country waltz tune. It has a slow tempo, and Uncut magazine contributor Graeme Thomson describes it as having a \\"calm, strangely hypnotic quality.\\" Young is backed on the song by the Stray Gators, with the addition of John Harris on piano. The piano plays a prominent role in the instrumentation. Sound on Sound editor Sam Inglis describes the drumming as \\"minimalist,\\" with drummer Kenny Buttrey using only one hand and playing only the snare drum and bass drum. The lyrics of \\"Harvest\\" are obscure. Music critic Johnny Rogan describes the lyrics as presenting rhetorical questions about a relationship with a woman. To Rogan, the singer wonders how much love he will receive from the relationship and the extent to which we will be able to accept – or harvest – that love. Music journalist Nigel Williamson regards the lyrics as reflecting Young's \\"inability to accept happiness at face value.\\" Williamson sees the refrain of \\"Dream up, dream up/Let me fill your cup\\" as another reference to the \\"harvest\\" in the title. Another interpretation of the lyrics is that they reflect the passage of time. Yet another interpretation is that the lyrics are about \\"maturing out of adolescence.\\" Young biographer Jimmy McDonough interprets lyrics such as \\"Did she wake you up to tell you that/It was only a change of plan\\" as referring to his then mother-in-law's previous suicide attempts. Inglis also interprets the line \\"Did I see you down in a young girl's town/With your mother in so much pain\\" as referring to this situation. Young biographer David Downing feels that the song works like a dream, being \\"so full of recognition, yet so short on sense.\\" Recording \\"Harvest\\" was recorded in April 1971. Unlike most of the songs on Harvest, which required a lot of mixing work, the released version of \\"Harvest\\" is a live two-track mix. Reception Inglis describes \\"Harvest\\" as one of Young's best confessional songs where he expresses his guilt about being unable accept and reciprocate all the love that a woman wants to give him. Thomson describes \\"Harvest\\" as \\"underrated\\" and \\"the prettiest song on [Harvest].\\" Allmusic critic Matthew Greenwald described it as having a \\"retrained, artless grace that is truly timeless.\\" McDonough regards it as \\"the one truly great moment on Harvest.\\" In 2014 the editors of Rolling Stone Magazine described \\"Harvest\\" as a \\"lesser- known gem.\\" On the other hand, in his initial review of the Harvest album, Rolling Stone Magazine critic John Mendelsohn criticized the Stray Gators playing as a \\"flaccid imitation\\" of Young's other backing band of the period, Crazy Horse. Young himself declared that \\"'Harvest' is one of my best songs.

It was organized by Jason Kessler to mark the first anniversary of the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, which ended in deadly violence and attracted both national and international attention. Unlike the original Unite the Right rally (which ended in street clashes and a car attack in which one counter- protester was killed and 30 others were injured by a self-identified neo- Nazi), the \\"Unite the Right 2\\" rally ended without violence. As of August 12, there was only one arrest in Washington, stemming from a confrontation after the rally had ended. The rally saw extremely low turnout, with only 20 to 30 of Kessler's supporters marching and thousands of counter-demonstrators amid a heavy police presence. The rally was widely described as a \\"pathetic\\" and \\"embarrassing\\" failure.Analysis Why 'Unite the Right' Rally Was a Pathetic Flop – and Why That Shouldn’t Matter . Allison Kaplan Sommer, Haaretz, 13 August 2018Rally by White Nationalists Was Over Almost Before It Began . The New York Times, 12 August 2018Everyone Loses When You Have to Rally Against White Supremacists . GQ, 13 August 2018 Background Unite the Right rally alt= The first Unite the Right rally was a white supremacist rally that occurred in Charlottesville, Virginia from August 11 to 12, 2017. Its goals were to oppose the removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee from Lee Park and to unify the white supremacist movement in the United States. The far- right protesters included alt-right members, white supremacists and white nationalists, neo-Confederates, Klansmen, neo-Nazis, and various militias, among others. The event turned violent after the protesters clashed with counter-protesters, leaving many injured. On the morning of August 12, Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe declared a state of emergency and the Virginia State Police declared the assembly unlawful. At around 1:45 p.m., a white supremacist rammed his car into a crowd of counter-protesters near the rally site and fled the scene, killing one person and injuring 19. Attorney General Jeff Sessions described the car attack as domestic terrorism. The driver, James Alex Fields Jr., was charged with first-degree murder and other crimes in state court as well as an additional 30 offenses in federal court, including violations of federal hate crime laws. In the aftermath of the violence, U.S. President Donald Trump's controversial remarks referring to \\"very fine people on both sides\\" and condemning \\"hatred, bigotry, and violence on many sides\\" were perceived by many as implying moral equivalence between white supremacist marchers and those protesting against them. Commentator Ed Kilgore suggested that \\"by moving their act into quite literally the president's neighborhood, and setting the stage for more violence\\" the demonstrators sought \\"a fresh infusion of respectability from the politician so many of them regard as a fellow traveler.\\" Attempt to schedule in Charlottesville Kessler initially attempted to schedule a second rally in Charlottesville, but was denied a permit by the city in December 2017. Kessler sued the city on First Amendment grounds, saying that if he had prevailed in the lawsuit, rallies would be held in both Charlottesville and Washington, D.C. In June 2018, Kessler sought a temporary injunction from the court to permit a rally in Emancipation Park on August 11 and 12. On June 24, 2018, during a court hearing, Kessler unexpectedly dropped plans to hold a rally in Charlottesville, and posted plans on Twitter for a rally in Washington, D.C. On August 3, 2018, after withdrawing his request for an injunction, Kessler voluntarily dismissed the lawsuit against the City of Charlottesville. Rally Plans and permits for demonstration and counter-demonstrations A counter-demonstrator holding a sign referring to alt= Counter-protesters and police in Lafayette Square on August 12, 2018 On May 8, 2018, Kessler filed an application for a permit for the rally with the National Park Service (NPS), under the name White Civil Rights Rally. After receiving initial approval in June 2018, the NPS granted the permit for up to 400 people on August 10, 2018. Amid a fracturing of the alt-right movement, a number of far-right individuals and groups who participated in the first Unite the Right rally—including Richard Spencer, the League of the South, Christopher Cantwell, Andrew Anglin, and militia groups—indicated that they would not attend the anniversary rally, having distanced themselves from Kessler, who holds \\"pariah status among his fellow racists.\\" The NPS also approved permits for counter-demonstrations filed by New York Black Lives Matter, Inc.; Thomas Oh; Metro DC Democratic Socialists of America or D.C. United Against Hate; the ANSWER Coalition; and the Partnership for Civil Justice Fund. Police and student protesters at the University of Virginia on August 12, 2018 The companies Airbnb, Lyft, and Uber issued statements reaffirming the right of hosts and drivers to \\"refuse service to anyone who makes them uncomfortable or violates guidelines against discrimination.\\" Authorities' preparation In advance of the rally, D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser activated the District's emergency operations center and returned early from a sister city tour in El Salvador to oversee the local response. The District's Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) and federal authorities made extensive preparation for \\"a possible volatile showdown\\" between \\"Unite the Right 2\\" demonstrators and counter-demonstrators. Authorities aimed to avoid a repeat of the violence at the Charlottesville rally the year before. MPD chief Peter Newsham said that the police would aim: \\"to keep the two groups separate. ... When they are in the same area at the same time, it leads to violent confrontations. Our goal is to prevent that from happening.\\" Authorities, specifically the MPD and the United States Park Police, erected a series of barriers at Lafayette Square to separate white supremacists from counter-demonstrators. In making security plans for the event, the Washington Metro system floated plans to run separate trains for protestors and counter-demonstrators, in a bid to avoid violent clashes. Following an outcry from the public and from the Metro employees' union (ATU Local 689), who regarded the plans as special treatment for white nationalists, Metro dropped consideration of the idea. However, on August 12, it was reported that Vienna Station had closed to the public, only allowing \\"Unite the Right 2\\" demonstrators, police, and press in (though they did reportedly stop at other stations and let the public in). The Metro was criticized by many, with people arguing that the service, as well as the police escort the \\"Unite the Right 2\\" demonstrators received, amounted to preferential treatment. Although no rally was scheduled to take place in Virginia--where the original rally took place one year earlier--the state's governor, Ralph Northam, declared a state of emergency, as smaller events were scheduled to take place in Charlottesville. Events Ahead of the rally, Newsham \\"remained elusive when discussing ingress and egress plans\\" for the \\"Unite the Right 2\\" demonstrated and implied \\"that the means and route Kessler's group ultimately takes could and probably would change at the last minute.\\" Ultimately, Kessler and a group of between 20 and 30 supporters got on the Washington Metro at the Vienna station in Northern Virginia and traveled to the Foggy Bottom station amid a heavy police presence, then proceeded to Lafayette Square in front of the White House, where Kessler gave a 15-minute speech and was met by thousands of anti-racist counterdemonstrators. The rally itself was scheduled for 5:30 to 7:30 p.m., but \\"ended early when it began to rain and two police vans escorted the demonstrators back to Virginia.\\" A local official said that the demonstrators were driven to the Rosslyn station in Northern Virginia to return to the Vienna station, \\"where they would be greeted by county police who could escort them to their cars if necessary.\\" The rally attracted thousands of counter- demonstrators, many of whom gathered at Freedom Plaza several blocks away from Lafayette Square to oppose white supremacy. Ahead of the rally, one organizer said she expected \\"participants with a range of political backgrounds from far-left to moderates to conservatives 'who agree that white supremacy is abhorrent.'\\" Demonstrators included a multiracial group of Baptists. A separate group of about 20 people sang \\"We Shall Overcome\\" while marching from the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial to the Lincoln Memorial. A small portion of counter-protestors were antifa activists; some black-clad protestors engaged in a brief confrontation with police close to 13th and G Streets NW, and some antifa protestors attacked journalists. The rally and counterdemonstrations ended without violence; there was one arrest stemming from a confrontation after the rally had ended. In a separate incident, one man was charged with simple assault in Virginia after allegedly spitting on two Virginia State Police officers outside the Vienna Metro stop. Costs According to a preliminary estimate prepared by the District of Columbia government, the District spent $2.6 million on costs related to the rally and the related counter-demonstrators. Almost all of the costs related to staffing and overtime for D.C. police. This cost estimate does not include expenditures incurred by other agencies (the Virginia State Police, Fairfax County Police Department, Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, and U.S. Park Police) related to the rally. Reactions Ahead of the rally, D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser stated: \\"We the people of Washington, D.C. say unequivocally that we denounce hate, we denounce anti-Semitism and we denounce the rhetoric that we expect to hear this Sunday.\\" The governors of the neighboring states-- Ralph Northam of Virginia and Larry Hogan of Maryland--made similar statements. President Donald Trump declined to specifically condemn white supremacy. Instead, he made a general call for unity and stated that he \\"condemn[s] all types of racism and acts of violence.\\" The remarks echoed Trump's remarks following the original rally a year earlier, in which he blamed \\"both sides\\" for violence. Vice President Mike Pence released a statement saying: \\"bigotry, racism and hatred run counter to our most cherished values and have no places in American society.\\"  See also  * 2020 VCDL Lobby Day References External links * Category:2018 in Washington, D.C.

Early life Wonohaquaham was the oldest son of Nanepashemet and the Squaw Sachem of Mistick. A few years after his father's death, Wonohaquaham became sachem of Mishawum, which consisted of the land near the Mystic River, including present-day Chelsea, Charlestown, Malden, Everett, Revere, Somerville, Woburn, and Stoneham as well as parts of Medford, Cambridge, Arlington, and Reading. He resided in Rumney Marsh (now known as Chelsea). In 1631, Thomas Dudley wrote that Wonohaquaham led around 30 or 40 followers and that they moved locations often. Relationship with English colonists Wonohaquaham was described as having a \\"gentle and good disposition\\" towards the English. In 1627, he gave them permission to settle in Charlestown. He was known to warn the colonists of impending attacks by unfriendly Indians. As early as 1631, Wonohaquaham, who was called Sagamore John by the colonists, spoke English wore English clothing, lived in English-style housing, and showed interest in Christianity. According to Dudley, this resulted in Wonohaquaham receiving the \\"scoffes of the Indians\\". Edward Howes wrote that he had \\"greate hopes\\" that Wonohaquaham become \\"civilized and a christian\\", however, Wonohaquaham chose to remain with the Pawtucket rather than joining the settlers. Wonohaquaham attempted to use the English court system to resolve disputes with mixed results. Many cases never made it to court, however in 1631 he received seven yards of cloth from Richard Saltonstall and fifty shillings sterling from Saltonstall's servant after the servant burnt two Pawtucket wigwams. Death In 1633, Wonohaquaham and thirty of his people died of smallpox. Prior to his death, Wonohaquaham asked Revered John Wilson to raise his two sons (only one of which survived the outbreak) and teach them of the Christian faith. He left his wampum and personal items to his mother and his land on Powder Horn Hill in Chelsea to his son. He also left gifts for John Winthrop and other colonists. In 1888, workers in West Medford discovered the remains of 18 Native Americans, which were believed to be those of Wonohaquaham and some of his followers. A 10 foot high monument was erected near the site in what is now known as Sagamore Park.

It signified one of the lowest moments in the history of greyhound racing. The 1969 option granted to Stock Conversion and Investment Ltd for development finally became a reality. The final meeting was held on 22 September where Hastings Girl trained by Tommy Foster won the final race. The last White City Derby was won by Whisper Wishes before the event switched to Wimbledon, despite calls for it to go to Wembley. The company that introduced greyhound racing to Britain, (the Greyhound Racing Association) came under severe criticism. The National Greyhound Racing Club (NGRC) released the annual returns, with totalisator turnover slightly down at £59,382,835 and attendances also slightly down recorded at 3,942,344 from 5191 meetings. Track tote remained at 17.5% and government tote tax at 4%. Whisper Wishes, a black dog was voted Greyhound of the Year. after winning the Derby at White City. 1984 Greyhound of the Year Yankee Express trained by George Curtis won a third successive Scurry Gold Cup title. Competitions The White City events switched to new tracks, in addition to receiving the Derby, Wimbledon would host the Springbok and the English Greyhound Derby Invitation. The Grand National went to Hall Green but the Longcross Cup and Wood Lane Stakes was discontinued. Tracks Walthamstow would take over the mantle as the leading track, as shown by the final of the Grand Prix. A crowd of more than 5,000 watched Sunrise Sonny win the race. Over one million tote units were sold, the highest recorded figure since 1945. Overshadowed by the closure of White City was the closure of three other tracks, on the 14 April both Cambridge and Perry Barr closed and Leicester ran its final meeting on 15 August after 56 years operating at Blackbird Road. It was sold by their owners Midland Sports to Barratts homes for new housing which left just Coventry operating under the name of Midland Sports. Mick Wheble who held the position of Racing Manager at Leicester and Coventry moved to take over at Oxford where Jim Layton had left for Brighton. Coventry recruited a young Racing Manager in Sean Doyle, son of trainer Paddy Doyle but Sean's career would be cut short when he died from cancer. Independent tracks Brean Sands and Blackburn both closed but Ashington in Northumberland re-opened. Northern Sports opened their new state of the art 200 seated grandstand restaurant and leisure facilities including squash and snooker clubs at Dumpton Park, Ramsgate. Brough Park was sold to Bernard Neesham who stopped trainers from supplying greyhounds to neighbour Gosforth. News White City trainers Tom Foster and David Kinchett joined Wimbledon and Ray Peacock went to Harringay Stadium. Frank Baldwin, Frank Melville, Graham Mann and Richard Griffin were left without a track. A black greyhound called Scurlogue Champ, whelped in July 1982 arrived in England after initially being sold at the Shelbourne Park sales and then on to owner/trainer Ken Peckham for £1700. He had an odd running style in that he would often be outpaced early before finishing with remarkable strength. From September he broke four long distance track records at Ipswich, Catford, Harringay and Hall Green. Another greyhound called Ballyregan Bob won his first race on 25 October 1984. Ireland Ger McKenna won a twelfth Irish St Leger and a fifth Irish Laurels.

After winning the league title in 1971–72, the club joined the Essex Olympian League and dropped the Rangers part of the name. They were runners-up in their first two seasons in the league. In 1981 the league gained a second division, with Benfleet becoming members of Division One. They were league runners-up again in 1981–82, before the league was renamed the Essex Intermediate League in 1986. The club were subsequently champions and Essex Intermediate Cup winners in 1988–89. In 1995–96 Benfleet finished second-from-bottom of Division One and were relegated to Division Two. They won the Essex Premier Cup in 2002–03. The league reverted to its original name in 2005, and the club were Division Two champions in 2006–07, earning promotion to the renamed Premier Division. After three seasons in the Premier Division, they were relegated back to Division One at the end of the 2009–10 season. The 2013–14 season ended with them being relegated to Division Two, and the club resigned from the league midway through the following season. Benfleet then re-entered the Essex Olympian League in Division Three for the 2015–16 season, going on to win the division and secure promotion to Division Two. At the end of the 2017–18 season the club successfully applied to join the new Division One South of the Eastern Counties League, a three division jump.

The lecturer, who must be a fellow of the College, is selected by the president and may be chosen to speak for two years successively. The lectures are supported by funds from the Fitzpatrick Trust which was established in 1901 by Agnes Letitia Fitzpatrick with a £2,000 donation in memory of her physician husband Thomas Fitzpatrick. Agnes was influenced by her husband’s close friend, Sir Norman Moore, who persuaded her to choose ‘’history of medicine’’ as a subject. Subsequently, Moore was credited with its idea and implementation. The first two Fitzpatrick lectures were given by Joseph Frank Payne, whose request instigated history of medicine lectures at the Royal Society of Medicine and with whose support Sir William Osler established the History of Medicine Section.

The aim of the book was to raise awareness amongst doctors and medical students about valuable medical knowledge from the past that has been ignored and catalogued as occult. The treasures of the past, that the author is concerned with and on which he develops his argument, are mostly extracted from the work and perspective of Theophrastus Paracelsus. On a broad level, the book is a comparison between the medical knowledge, practices and system contemporary to the author and those predicated by Theophrastus Paracelsus and supported by Theosophy in general. Additionally, an implicit underlying theme of the book is the nature of science and knowledge - the author advocates against conservative science (i.e. the paradigm within which all the scientists, and in particular medical practitioners, conduct their research or perform their job; popular and superficial science) and contrasts it with progressive science (i.e. exploring new realms of knowledge without being constrained by contemporary fashionable theories). From a psychological perspective, there is a dualistic representation of the mind and of the body (in accordance with Descartes' dualism) in relation to the constitution of man, diseases and their place in contemporary medicine.  Historical context  The book was written in the context of the author being an active member of the Theosophical Society and a faithful adept of H.P. Blavatsky's viewpoint. The Theosophical Society had significant effects on Western religion, politics, culture and society and it played a significant role in the introduction of Asian religious ideas into the Western world. Furthermore, the book was published the same year Hartmann started editing a German Theosophical monthly journal called Lotusblüten (1893-1900). Interestingly, the book advocates for dualism in a time when this philosophical view of the mind was perishing. During the end of the 19th century, scientific knowledge was advancing fast and the Mind-Body Dualism was being replaced by Materialism. This new perspective on the mind was advocated by British Empiricists during the 18th and 19th centuries, who were carefully trying to dismiss the idea of an incorporeal, independent mind (i.e. so that they do not upset the Church) as being implausible. We are looking at a time period when people discovered that many brain processes were just reflexes and when Charles Darwin's Evolutionary Theory started to have great impact on Psychology and Philosophy. Notably, the principle of natural selection opposed the teleological view of the world that was established during Aristotle's time and further exploited by the Christian Church - this new concept had remarkable power for explaining directional and adaptive changes without the implication of a divine authority such as God. Consequently, the body starts to be seen as a mechanical device that strives for survival and the place of the soul and immaterial substances (i.e. the mind) has no longer a place in science. This is further supported by the emergence of Behaviourism (i.e. the opposing view to Mind-Body Dualism), with its earliest derivatives traced back to the late 19th century when Edward Thorndike pioneered the law of effect, a process that involved strengthening behavior through the use of reinforcement.  Previous work  Hartmann's first work on Occultism was Magic, White and Black which appears to be the result of discussions with H.P. Blavatsky; this book can be considered the start of his argument for using the occult side of the nature to advance knowledge, science and medical practice. His second work was The life of Paracelsus and the Substance of his teachings, which reveals that Hartmann was a physician with a profound understanding of the occult philosophy od Theophrastus Paracelsus. These two first publications of Hartmann can be seen as a precursor of soon to be published Occult science in medicine which is an unifying account of how the occult teachings of Theophrastus Paracelsus can be applied to attain true knowledge and advance contemporary medicine.  Structure  The book consists of five parts, with the most general topic discussed in Part 1 and the most specific points being made in Part 5. Each part is structured as a comparison between contemporary knowledge, science, medicine and their occult counterpart. Each part introduces a different topic with the heading describing what it is going to be approached: *Part 1: The constitution of man *Part 2: The four pillars of medicine *Part 3: The five causes of disease *Part 4: The five classes of physicians *Part 5: The medicine of the future The structure being employed makes the argument easy to follow and provides it with unity by implicitly supporting the links between the different parts.  Content   Part 1: The constitution of man  Given that popular science has no information about the power that drives human development, nor about the nature or the origin of the human mind, it is understandable to look into other sources of information and consider what the Ancient sages taught about the principles that govern the constitution of man. This reasoning is employed as a justification for using occult knowledge. Theosophical literature summarizes Ancient knowledge regarding the above-mentioned principles as follows - the sevenfold constitution of man: * Rupa (i.e. physical body); * Prana (i.e. life, vital principle); * Linga Sharira (i.e. astral body - counterpart of the physical body); * Kama rupa (i.e. animal soul); * Manas (i.e. mind, intelligence - connecting the mortal and immortal man); * Buddha (i.e. mind, intelligence - connecting the mortal and immortal man); * Atma (i.e. spirit); It is highlighted how Ancient medicine was a religious science, recognizing the source of universal life (Note: The term religion does not refer to any of the existing systems of religious doctrines or forms of worship, but to the spiritual recognition of divine truth) and how popular modern medicine recognizes no real truth because it is concerned only with the lowest plane of existence (i.e. the physical body) by recognizing only the outcome of a blind force. Medicine cannot be separated from religion because the essence of the human being is its divine source (i.e. highest plane of existence) and not the physical body (i.e. lowest plane of existence). This is the recurrent dualistic presentation of the nature of man that is the basis of Hartmann's argument. Theophrastus Paracelsus is portrayed as the father of medicine and given as example of a physician that recognized the sevenfold constitution of man and used this knowledge to treat his patients.  Part 2: The four pillars of medicine  The pillars upon which the practice of modern medicine, which is concerned only with the external plane of existence (i.e. the physical world), rests: * A knowledge of the physical body (i.e. Anatomy, Philology, Pathology) * Certain amount of acquaintance with physical science; * Acquaintance with the views and opinions of modern accepted medical authorities (however erroneous they may be); * A certain amount of judgement and aptitude to put the acquired theories into practice;. Psychology is portrayed as a misnomer with Hartmann arguing that there can be no science of the soul as long as its existence is not acknowledged. The author is an adept of Theophrastus Paracelsus' pillars of medicine: *Philosophia \\\\- it is not concerned with the Philosophy that existed at the time (i.e. logic, inferences, speculations) but a system in which there is a great deal of love for the truth (i.e. recognition of self in another form). This pillar is based on the power of recognizing the truth in all things independent of any books or authorities. As depicted by Hartmann, this is an argument against working within a contemporary paradigm because existing theories hinder the ability to see and extract knowledge from nature. This realm of Philosophia includes all the natural sciences referring to external phenomena, but also those sciences concerned with the interior world (Note: the exterior world is a mere expression of the interior world). Hartmann concludes with the mention that a science referring merely to the terrestrial life is not the summit of all possible knowledge, because beyond the realm of visible phenomena there is a far more extensive realm open to all who are capable of entering the realm of truth. Thus, his main poin is that contemporary medicine is good, but not enough because it is concerned only with the physical body. *Astronomia \\\\- in contemporary times, it is the science of celestial bodies, but in Theophrastus Paracelsus' view, astronomy represents the various states of the mind existing in the microcosm of nature as well as in the microcosm of man. Interestingly, Hartmann supports Theophrastus Paracelsus' idea that man, far from creating his own thoughts, merely remodels the ideas that flow into his mind. This requires a further consideration of free will and of the amount of responsibility of man; nonetheless, the author does not extend on this idea. *Alchemy \\\\- his main aim regarding this topic is merely to remove existing misconceptions and to raise awareness amongst students and doctors - and maybe they will use this knowledge to attain real knowledge. Alchemy (concerned with living spiritual powers and wisdom) and Chemistry (concerned with the physical world) are depicted as being two aspects of the same science (i.e. one is the lower, and the other one is the higher part). He believes that by combining them, science will discover how life emerges from the chemical properties of the physical world. *The virtue of the physician \\\\- it is argued that passing an examination and obtaining the title of M.D. does not make you a doctor (i.e. it is just an academical degree). The true physician is ordained by God (i.e. people cannot make someone a doctor, they can only give the right to act as one, but with no the power to heal). Hartmann's main point regarding this topic is best described by Theophrastus Paracelsus' words: Medical wisdom is only given by God.  Part 3: The five causes of disease  The classification of the causes of disease, acknowledged by modern medical science, is an enumeration of certain conditions in which disease may arise (e.g. Age, Heredity, Temperament, Mental and moral conditions, Temperature, Epidemic disease, Contagion, Malaria etc.). Theophrastus Paracelsus' classification is depicted as a better description of the causes of disease. He classifies diseases as those originating in the kingdom of matter (i.e. physical body), within the realm of the soul (i.e. energy) or in the sphere of the spirit (i.e. intelligence). As long as these three substances are in harmony with each other the individual is healthy; an imbalance will result in disease. The five causes of disease advocated by Theophrastus Paracelsus are: * Ens astrale \\\\- diseases arising from external influences (i.e. surrounding conditions); * Ens veneni \\\\- disease originating from poisonous actions and impurities in all three planes of existence; * Ens naturale \\\\- diseases which have their origin in certain conditions inherent in the constitution of man (quality of body, soul and mind as they were received from nature - includes all inherited physical diseases, qualities of temperament and mental peculiarities); * Ens spirituale \\\\- diseases arising from spiritual causes (spirit = consciousness in every plane of existence). Furthermore, the spirit is depicted as having three functions: Will, Imagination, Memory; From a psychological perspective, the three functions of the soul depicted by Hartmann represent fundamental cognitive processes. Will is presented as being distinct from the selfish desire of the brain - it is a strong power which drives all voluntary and involuntary actions in the organism of man, whether or not we are conscious of it. Imagination is the power of the mind to form images. Memory is presented as the ability of the spirit to visit those places within the sphere of his mind where former experiences are preserved, and thus to bring them again within the field of consciousness. Furthermore, it is highlighted that the brain is just an instrument for perception - thus, Hartmann advocates for a spirit/mind that interacts with the body, using it as an instrument. * Ens del - diseases arising from eternal retribution (in the East, called the law of Karma) or the action of divine justice throughout the Universe.  Part 4: The five classes of physicians  Based on Theophrastus Paracelsus' doctrine, the author makes a distinction between: * Science of the lower methods (i.e. prescribing drugs, using hot/cold water, applying any other physical forces) can be taught to anybody in possession of an ordinary amount of intelligence. * Science of the higher methods (i.e. the real art of medicine) requires higher gifts that cannot be acquired in any other way than according to the law of spiritual evolution and higher development of the inner man. Accordingly, there are lower and higher order physicians. Theophrastus Paracelsus' five classes of physicians are: * Three lower classes (they seek for resources in the material plane): ** Naturales - They employ physical remedies acting as opposites - e.g. using cold water for fever (Allopaths - regular practitioners); ** Specifici - They use physical remedies which experience has shown to work for specific problems ( Empirics, Homeopaths - regular practitioners that have knowledge about how some remedies work in specific situations - the result of observation, and not of knowledge of the fundamental laws of nature); ** Characterales - They employ the power of the mind - act upon the will and imagination of the patients (Mind healer, Mesmerism) * Two higher classes (they employ remedies belonging to the super sensual plane): ** Spirituales - They are in possession of spiritual powers, using the magic power of their own will and thought (Magic, Psychometry, Hypnotism, Spiritism); ** Fideles - through whom \\"miraculous\\" works are performed in the power of the true faith (Adepts).  Part 5: The medicine of the future  In the final part, the author reflects on the progress of science since the time of Theophrastus Paracelsus and concludes that even though knowledge has been advanced, it does not mean that human kind is wiser. He believes that more spiritual knowledge is needed in order to attain wisdom. Furthermore, in order to attain this spiritual knowledge, the author encourages his readers to get to know their constitution and the nature of the higher power that resides in them. Hartmann supports Theophrastus Paracelsus' view that wisdom is not the intellect of the terrestrial, but the understanding of the celestial mind. Thus, he encourages spiritual self- knowledge and the use of the higher order knowledge to advance the field of medicine.  Reception  In 1894, Occult Science in Medicine was seen as an important manuscript that provided access to the system of medicine of Paracelsus in times when materialistic empiricism in medicine seemed to approach its end while the importance of the mind (i.e. thought) was beginning to be recognized again in the cure of disease. Nevertheless, The Physician of the Future chapter was seen as the weakest part of the book because the priest becomes discredited as a physician. In general, the book was seen as superior to contemporary materialistic medical science which was portrayed as being far from any intelligent appreciation of the ideas portrayed by Hartmann. Evaluating the theosophical situation today reveals that theosophy is not dying out, but rather, experiencing a renaissance. Given such circumstances, it is not surprising that Franz Hartmann's work is republished and appreciated in the 21st century, with appreciative comments from readers.

research vessel that was operated by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (United Kingdom) - Directorate of Fisheries, now known as the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas) between 1961 and 1988. She was constructed by Cochrane Shipbuilders Ltd., of Selby (Yorkshire) in 1961 and operated out of the port of Lowestoft. In early 1988 the RV Clione was sold to Putford Enterprises of Great Yarmouth, and converted into an offshore oil rig stand-by ship. However, she was re-hired by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (United Kingdom) in December when the Ministry’s new survey vessel RV Corystes was taken out of service at short notice, requiring a change of propeller. The RV Clione was renamed as the MV Putford Petrel on 3 May 1991.Lowestoft Journal, press-cutting file - renaming of the Clione Putford Petrel, 3 May 1991, http://www.dswebhosting.info/Suffolk/SRODServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp;=Site31&dsqDb;=Catalog&dsqCmd;=show.tcl&dsqSearch;=(RefNo%271176%2F2%2F2%2F16%2F219%27), Accessed 22/06/2018 . In 2000 the MV Putford Petrel was sold again and converted to a motor yacht. She was renamed as the Lynn G and is currently listed as being owned by the Dutch Film Unit – Lettele, Netherlands, although her whereabouts are unknown.LYNN G - 5076119 - YACHT, http://maritime- connector.com/ship/lynn-g-5076119/, Accessed 22/06/2018 Construction The RV Clione was commissioned in 1960 as a replacement for the earlier fisheries research vessel, the RV Sir Lancelot. She was built by Cochrane Shipbuilders Ltd. of Selby (yard number 1458) in Yorkshire. She was launched on 22 August 1960 and sea trials began on 15 March 1961. She was registered in Lowestoft on 20 March 1961 – (as LT 421).Clione - steel motor research ship, registration LT 421, https://www.suffolkarchives.co.uk/collections/getrecord/GB175_1448_6_8_20, Accessed 22/06/2018 The May 1961 issue of The Motor Ship, included an article describing a novel rudder design employed on the RV Clione.‘The Motor Ship’, May 1961, http://www.motorship.com/news101/comment-and-analysis/historical- reviews/oil-reserves-running-out-1961-shock, Accessed 22/06/2018 It suggests that the new UK fishery research ship, the Clione, had been fitted with a Pleuger active rudder for increased maneuverability and position-keeping. The German-built rudder was fitted in the conventional position, aft of the vessel’s FP propeller, and built into the blade was a 100 hp AC squirrel-cage electric motor driving a small propeller. This was said to be capable of moving the ship at 5 knots on its own, but was primarily used for low-speed maneuvering. Service as a fisheries research vessel The RV Clione (LT421) was in service with Directorate of Fisheries from 1961 until 1988, during which time she participated in 486 separate research campaigns. In 1961-2, Ray Beverton took up the investigation of plaice, and together with Derek Tungate developed a high speed plankton sampler, nicknamed the ‘tin tow’ net. It was used from a re-arranged after deck on the RV Clione to carry out a series of surveys of plaice and herring eggs and larvae in the southern bight of the North Sea. June 1963 saw an attempt to see if it would be possible to establish a British tuna fishery, when the RV Clione (cruise CLI/11/1963) made an exploratory cruise off the coasts of Portugal and Mediterranean Morocco. This was followed up in June 1965 (cruise CLI/8/1965) when the RV Clione made a voyage to the waters around the Canary Islands, but like the earlier one it proved abortive. At the end of the 1960s, the activities of beam-trawlers in the North Sea brought complaints from other fishermen that beam-trawls were adversely affecting stocks and the benthic food of fish. It therefore became necessary to study the effects of trawling on the sea bed. At first scuba divers and underwater cameras were deployed from the RV Clione, but eventually an ARL Scanner was fitted to RV Clione as a result of collaboration with Admiralty scientists at the Admiralty Research Laboratory, Teddington. This equipment had been developed during wartime for mine-hunting purposes. It ‘illuminated’ a sector of the sea-bed with sound and so indicated its configuration. It enabled fishing gear and fish to be ‘viewed’ in three dimensions from the research vessel for the first time. Throughout its years of service the RV Clione was employed on the large-scale tagging and transplantation of plaice from one sandbank to ‘foreign grounds’ in the North Sea. In 1964 (cruise CLI/2/1964) 13,000 plaice from the three principle spawning grounds were tagged and released, both locally on their ‘home grounds’ but also further afield to look at differential growth rates and migration patterns. The RV Clione was deployed on a number of surveys looking at sandeel populations in the North Sea. In July 1975 she was engaged in a spawning ground survey (cruise CLI/11B/1975) using the unmanned ANGUS submersible developed by Heriot-Watt University, off the Northeast coast of England.CLI/11B/1975, Cruise summary report, https://www.bodc.ac.uk/resources/inventories/cruise_inventory/report/7588/ Accessed 22/06/2018 On 27 July 1984 the Lowestoft Journal featured an article under the title \\"request for new research vessel to replace aging \`Clione’\\".Lowestoft Journal, press-cutting file - http://www.dswebhosting.info/Suffolk/SRODServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp;=Site31&dsqCmd;=Show.tcl&dsqDb;=Catalog&dsqPos;=1&dsqSearch;=%28%28text%29%3D%27clione%27%29, Accessed 22/06/2018 . This was followed on 30 January 1987 with an \\"advert for sale by open tender of research vessel \`Clione\`, LT 421\\". Finally, on 6 February 1987 the Lowestoft Journal featured an article under the title – \\"26-year-old research vessel \`Clione\` up for sale as new replacement \`Corystes\` in last stages of sea trials\\". In early 1988 the RV Clione was sold to Putford Enterprises of Great Yarmouth. The RV Clione was re-hired by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (United Kingdom) in December 1988 to carry out surveys at the Hastings Shingle Bank, sewage sludge dump sites off Plymouth and aggregate extraction sites off the Isle of Wight, using side scan sonar, epibenthic dredges and underwater photography. This was necessary when the Ministry’s existing survey vessel RV Corystes was taken out of service at short notice, requiring a change of propeller.

It was envisioned by Congressman Pablo Roman, Sr., a representative from Bataan, who authored Republic Act 5490 designating the said location as the first free trade zone in the Philippines.https://www.ibiblio.org/ahkitj/wscfap/arms1974/Book%20Series/Faith&SocialJus;/F&SJ- bataan.htm;http://www.chanrobles.com/republicactno5490.htm#.W1qDMdUzbIU Background The Freeport Area of Bataan is the first \\"free trade zone\\" in the Philippines established through the enactment of Republic Act No. 5490 by the Congress of the Philippines. The freeport was envisioned by the late Congressman Pablo Roman, father of former Bataan Governor Ding Roman. The freeport is currently operated and managed by the Authority of the Freeport Area of Bataan (AFAB), a government agency under the Office of the President of the Philippines (formerly by Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA), an agency attached to the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) before the turnover of operations and management to AFAB on June 30, 2010). FAB is located in a cove at the southern tip of the Bataan Peninsula. It is about 172.3 kilometers from Manila via the North Luzon Expressway, Jose Abad Santos Avenue (Olongapo-Gapan Road), and Roman Superhighway. It has a total land area of 153.9 km2 or representing 12% of the total land area of Bataan. Of this, about 35% consist of the pastureland, 4.6% of forestland, 3.8% agricultural lands and the remaining 6% for residential and industrial use. It is home to a Filipino community speaking a Languages of the Philippines called Mariveleño. According to the 2000 census, it has a population of 85,779 people in 19,460 households. Agricultural resources include rice, mangoes, legumes, vegetables and coffee. It also has aquatic resources like round scads, grouper, mussel, and abalone; mineral deposits of granite and basalt and forest products like vines and bamboo. The tennis balls used in the Wimbledon Grand Slam are made in FAB. Scope The FAB covers 2 barangays of Mariveles namely Barangays Maligaya (Pizarro) and Malaya (Quadro).

He was the founder and during its first seven years the producer of the respected political weekly journal Das Tage-Buch.  Life   Provenance and early years  Born in the city's central Wollzeile district, Stefan Großmann described himself as the \\"son of impoverished Viennese citizens\\". Leopold Großmann (1836-1901), his father had been in business, but had lost his money and his will to work in the economic crash of the 1870s. His mother, born Sophie Brummel (1845-1916), used what remained of the family money to invest in a tea shop. Later she opened a liquor kiosk near the Prater, the park and amusement centre on the south-eastern side of Vienna. Großmann was expected to serve the customers during the early morning shift, before he went to school. He later reflected that although these early starts might have been detrimental to his school performance, the direct contact they gave him with \\"ordinary workers\\" and the staff from the adjacent Carltheater had a defining impact on the rest of his life.Stefan Großmann: Ich war begeistert, Berlin 1930 & Vienna 2011 He left school when he was seventeen, half a year before he was due to take his final exams, without telling his parents, and began to take an increasing interest in the socialist movement. The Social Democratic Party had been founded in 1889 and was conspicuously still far outside the political mainstream: at the Gumpendorf Workers' Education Association Großmann found like-minded young socialist \\"extremists\\", to the disgust of his parents who had hoped to prepare their son for a conventional middle-class existence. After an intensifying battle with his mother he turned his back on his family's Jewish background and had himself baptised as a Christian, a decision which he later linked with the \\"instinctive antisemitism of my early years\\". When he was eighteen he moved to Paris where he remained for two years, supporting himself with translation work and by trading in second-hand books. He followed the unfolding Dreyfus affair and the speeches of the time delivered in Paris by the young socialist leader Jean Jaurès with fascination and close attention.  Young journalist  His father's deteriorating health persuaded Großmann to return to Vienna after two years. He found himself promising his father that would take on a \\"proper job\\" (einen \\"bürgerlichen Beruf\\"). For the next two years he worked in an office as an insurance actuary. During this period he also published his first journalistic contributions in \\"Die Zukunft\\" (\\"The Future\\"), a radical labour weekly news sheet. He was only twenty when he had his first experience of a \\"press trial\\", but it ended in an acquittal. It was also at this time during his frequent visits to Vienna's Café Griensteidl (\\"coffee house\\"), that he met and got to know Anna Reisner, a young stage actress. He fell in love, and when the object of his affections accepted a part in a Berlin stage production he accompanied her to the German capital. There he made lodged with the anarcho-socialist Gustav Landauer. While still in Vienna he had already contributed articles to Landauer's Berlin-based newspaper, Der Sozialist, which described itself as the \\"mouthpiece of independent socialism\\" (\\"Organ der unabhängigen Sozialisten\\"). He now became a more full-time contributor and general assistant. His brand of politics was not popular with the authorities, however, and after only a few months he was identified as a \\"troublesome outsider\\" (\\"lästiger Fremder\\") and expelled from the country. He moved across to Brussels but remained there only for a few months before returning \\"home\\" to Vienna. While still in Brussels he had received and accepted an invitation from Gustav Schönaich to take on an editorship role at \\"Wiener Rundschau\\", a newly launched fortnightly publication. He also published articles in Hermann Bahr's weekly Vienna newspaper (from 1902 joined by a daily version) Die Zeit. Through a handful of articles submitted to the Arbeiter-Zeitung (Vienna \\"Workers' Newspaper\\") Großmann then came into contact with Victor Adler, a leading figure in the Austrian labour movement. This led to a regular position as an Arbeiter-Zeitung contributing editor in 1904. Under the pseudonym \\"Oblomow\\" he contributed theatre criticism and feature articles. He also became Arbeiter-Zeitung's regular court reporter at the commercial court. One story that he followed up involved a visit to the prison at Stein an der Donau, a short distance upriver from Vienna. The result of Großmann's visit to Stein was \\"the first factual description of a prison\\", which appeared in Arbeiter-Zeitung. The article came to the notice of government leaders. As a result of that, he went on to cause a stir with a series of articles that he published, at the prompting of then recently replaced Austrian Minister- President Ernest von Koerber, in which he dealt with conditions in Austrian prisons. The articles, which pressed the case for prison reform through careful factual reporting, were subsequently grouped together and published in a single volume. Großmann's experiences of the prisoners and those supervising them were then recycled when he used them for a stage-play, \\"Der Vogel im Käfig\\" (\\"The caged bird\\") which had its Viennese premier in 1906.  Popular theatre  A remarkable career switch came in 1906 when Stefan Großmann founded a new theater, the \\"Freie Volksbühne für die Wiener Arbeiter\\" (\\"Free popular theatre for Viennese workers\\"), consciously modelled on the Volksbühne theatre in Berlin. Großmann undertook the project with the backing of the increasingly self-confident Social Democratic Workers' Party (SDAPÖ - as the Social Democratic Party was then known). (SDAPÖ backing did not extend to financial support, however.) On 21 June 1906 the company's first performance took place, with a staging of \\"Hinauf zu den Sternen\\" by the controversial Russian writer Leonid Andreyev at the Theater in der Josefstadt. In 1908 the company staged the first performance of Hugo von Hofmannsthal's stage play, \\"Elekra\\". The theatre project was a great success artistically and, for several years, financially. At the end of the 1911/12 season, it was reported that 750 performances had been attended by around 650,000 people. According to at least one source the theatre association had a membership of more than 25,000. The theatre company included well known actors of the time, including Max Pallenberg, Raoul Aslan and Ernst Deutsch. Set designers who worked at the theatre included Alfred Kubin and Erwin Lang. The chief dramaturge, appointed in 1911, was Berthold Viertel. By 1911 the architect Oskar Kaufmann had been commissioned to design a new theatre for the company. He and Großmann collaborated closely on the design of the \\"classless\\" theatre building, which would be built without galleries and loggias. However, by the time the theatre opened, in 1914, the building had been sold. The Wiener Stadttheater was completed featuring a traditional \\"renaissance stage\\", and without reference to the socialist egalitarian precepts of the original design, remodelled after 1918 and quickly becoming, in the words of one dismissive commentator, the venue for \\"wholesome\\" operetta productions. In 1913 the company had been forced to sell the still unfinished building to the politically well-connected architectural firm of Fellner & Helmer, which is charged in some quarters with having \\"successfully sabotaged the entire project\\". Despite the ferocious personal energy he devoted to the project, the happy combination of circumstances that had enabled the theatre to flourish came to an abrupt end. There was a change of government and following a period of intense wrangling completion of a theatre building was blocked by the authorities. At this critical moment Großmann himself was out of action, confined to hospital by a serious stomach complaint. Confrontation with other leading members of the theatre association led to his decision, during the first part of 1913, to sever his ties with Vienna and relocate, with his Swedish-born wife and their two daughters, to Berlin. Großmann spelled out his feelings and motives during this time of personal crisis in his novel \\"Die Partei\\" which was published (in Berlin) in 1919.  From editor to publisher  There was nothing random in choosing Berlin. He already had a strong journalistic reputation in the German capital, thanks to his regular contributions to the Berlin theatre magazine \\"Schaubühne\\" and, in the past, to Max Harden's Vienna based anarcho-socialist \\"Die Zukunft\\" (\\"The Future\\"). Großmann had good contacts with a number of influential media figures in the city, including the proprietor of \\"Schaubühne\\" Siegfried Jacobsohn, and did not have to wait long for offers of work from Berlin publishers. Franz Ullstein managed to secure his services for the \\"Vossische Zeitung\\", although his precise duties with the newspaper were not immediately clear. After several months \\"trying out\\" different departments he finally expressed a wish to work as a foreign correspondent in France, England and the United States of America. The outbreak of war in July 1914 meant that his foreign posting never extended beyond a brief stay in France during the early summer of that year. He was then posted for six months to Vienna, after which he took on the editorship of the Vossische Zeitung's Feuilleton section. He stayed with the Feuilleton job till the war ended. During the early part of the First World War Stefan Großmann was one of very few journalists not to join in the insane enthusiasm that erupted across Europe. \\"War fever\\" was conspicuously absent from his journalism. Großmann left the \\"Vossische Zeitung\\" in 1919, taking responsibility for an article that had outraged conservative readers. In 1920 he teamed up with the publisher Ernst Rowohlt to found the weekly political journal, Tage-Buch. Tage-Buch was independent and not affiliated to any political party: its overall approach was driven by the philosophy and beliefs of its founders and of its first publisher, Stefan Großmann. In the early years the extent of Großmann was masked in that many of his contributions were attributed to Thomas Wehrlin or Carlotto Graetz: these were pseudonyms. It was often compared with Die Weltbühne, originally a \\"theatre magazine\\", which by the 1920s was focused more broadly on politics, art, and business. During the Weimar years the two publications emerged as influential proponents of radical and democratic solutions. The effectiveness of Tage-Buch was enhanced after 1921 when the intellectually formidable Leopold Schwarzschild became a co- proprietor. Regular contributors to the journal included many of the nation's leading intellectuals. In 1928 Großmann's declining health forced him to retire from his management responsibilities at Tage-Buch, and these now passed fully to his younger co-proprietor. In 1933 Schwarzschild led the small Tage- Buch team into a Paris exile, where the journal continued to be published till 1940. Although there was nothing contrived about Großmann's declining health, his resignation from Tage-Buchs management in 1928, accompanied by the sale of his shares in it to Schwarzschild, also reflected growing personal differences between the two men. Three years later, in 1931, Schwarzschild suspended payment of Großmann's agreed pension entitlement from the journal: a lengthy litigation ensued.  Final chapter  Resigning his proprietorship and editorial duties did not put an end to Großmann's journalistic contributions which continued to appear in Tage-Buch and in numerous other publications. 1928 also saw the publication of his novel \\"Chefredakteur Roth führt Krieg\\" (loosely \\"Managing editor Roth leads the war\\"), a prescient work in which the protagonist manages to dominate public opinion in a major city using his tabloid newspaper. Two years later he published his autobiography, \\"Ich war begeistert\\" (loosely \\"I was enthused\\"). During the early 1930s he also made a return to the world of theatre, working as a dramatist with Franz Hessel to stage productions at the Berlin Volksbühne theatre and then, opening on Christmas Day 1931 at the Berlin Großes Schauspielhausin, an \\"updated version\\" of The Rape of the Sabine Women. In January 1933 the Nazis took power and lost no time in transforming Germany into a one-party dictatorship. Riding the traditional populist pillars of hatred and hope, the new government used the security services to target political opponents, starting with those who had eloquently derided and mocked them when in opposition. And they trained their sights on those they identified as Jews. In March 1933 Nazi paramilitaries arrived with the police at Stefan Großmann's home at Geltow, just outside Berlin. Their orders were to arrest him and send him for \\"internment\\". However, he was plainly very ill, which caused them to ignore the arrest order and \\"spare\\" him. They did, however, issue an order of their own, that Großmann should leave Germany. Soon after that he returned for the last time, with his wife, to Vienna. He was terminally ill and destitute, but he had never been forgotten by the media establishment in the Austrian capital, where his theatre reviews, court reports and other contributions had continued to appear in the city's newspapers. He continued to find work. Two of his contributions from that final period, in particular, stand out. In June 1933 - following an example set by \\"Managing editor Roth\\" in his own recent novel - Großmann published a polemical \\"Open letter to Gerhart Hauptmann\\". Hauptmann had failed to speak out in support of his Jewish colleague Max Reinhardt who was having problems with the Nazis. He had failed to condemn Nazi book burnings. He had found nothing to say about the expulsions of Heinrich and Thomas Mann, Leonhard Frank, Alfred Döblin and Jakob Wassermann. He had remained a member of the Prussian Poets' Academy \\"... alongside Hanns Johst\\". \\"In an age ruled by self-serving cowardice, your silence at this time is one of the bitterest disappointments that we have experienced\\". The next year he published an anonymous article in Klaus Mann's literary monthly, \\"Die Sammlung\\" (published \\"in exile\\" in Amsterdam) under the headline \\"Independent Austria\\" (\\"Unabhängiges Österreich\\"). He identified the \\"causes of the crushing defeat of the Viennese workers\\" (den \\"Ursachen der vernichtenden Niederlage der Wiener Arbeiter\\") in the brief but savagely ended uprising of February 1934. He closed with a gloomy but accurate prediction of an Austria integrated into a larger German state. Chancellor Dolfuss, shortly before his own assassination, became aware of Großmann's article and took the opportunity to place a formal ban, in Austria, on \\"Die Sammlung\\". On 3 January 1935 Stefan Großmann died of heart failure in Vienna. He native city had become, since 1933, the place of his exile.  Personal  Stefan Großmann met Ester Strömberg (1873–1944) in 1901.

Ballyregan Bob won 21 consecutive races by the end of the year including the Olympic final, Test and Essex Vase final. Trainer George Curtis then chose wisely as to which events to go for in order to preserve the chance of breaking the world record which stood at 31. He was voted Greyhound of the Year. Scurlogue Champ became a crowd favourite with his remarkable running style and became a household name when winning BBC Television Trophy on 22 May at Monmore and setting 13 new track records around the country. The National Greyhound Racing Club (NGRC) released the annual returns, with totalisator turnover at £59,110,759 and attendances recorded at 3,786,216 from 4736 meetings. Track tote remained at 17.5% and government tote tax at 4%. Tracks Southend closed after Boxing Day and Weymouth was redeveloped which ended the greyhound racing there. The Crayford & Bexleyheath Stadium raced until 18 May before the stadium was closed for major redevelopment by Ladbrokes. Work started on a new stadium on a different part of the site and would become known as Crayford Stadium. Brough Park was sold again when former trainer Kevin Wilde headed a management team that leased the track. Kinsley was taken over by John Curran and Keith Morrell and Poole shut for four months during renovation. Whitwood in Castleford raced for the first time under NGRC rules after switching from independent status. News An Act of Parliament was passed in July allowing tracks to choose their own days of racing. NGRC secretary Fred Underhill had campaigned to change the laws governing race days and frequency of race days. On 12 December Ballyregan Bob risked losing his winning run when taking part in the John Power Showdown at Wembley, a race that included Scurlogue Champ. The run at the time stood at 19 wins and he only needed one win to match the 1974 record set by Westpark Mustard. In an anticlimax Scurlogue Champ failed to finish after pulling up lame leaving Ballyregan Bob to equal the record and annihilate the field. A future BBC TV trophy winner Glenowen Queen trailed in 11¾ behind in second place. Competitions Smokey Pete trained by Kenny Linzell won both the Scottish Greyhound Derby and Edinburgh Cup, during the latter he defeated kennelmate Ballintubber One by a short head. It is the third time the pair have finished 1-2 in a competition following the same in the Select Stakes and Circuit. Ireland The Irish Greyhound Board produced figures showing increases in export sales including exporting to Spain. Tico, a black dog by The Stranger out of Derry Linda first ran at Clonmel on 8 July for his breeder Jimmy Morrissey of Carrick-on-Suir and won in impressive fashion by ten lengths, recording 29.86 seconds for the 525 yards course. A few weeks later he came into the charge of Slough trainer, Arthur Hitch. Tico cost his new owner, Alan Smee, £5,000 and had a few acclimatising runs at Wimbledon towards the end of the year.

Part ghost story, part detective-fiction, it was published by First Second Books on the 8th of May 2018. Story The novel is set in a quiet neighborhood in Kyoto, Japan where, unbeknownst to the general public, children are mysteriously disappearing. Two elementary school friends, Sayuri and Hisao, slowly come to realize that inauspicious, paranormal forces are at play in the most unlikely of places: the local playground. This playground is haunted by a trapped, snaggled-tooth ghost named Toothless, whose body was buried and never recovered. As Toothless reveals the playground's secrets, Sayuri and Hisao slowly come to realize that the tragic events in their hometown are connected to its supernatural powers. When one of their friends gets hurt, they resolve to exorcise the playground's evil. They set out on a search for Toothless's missing body, in hopes of releasing his spirit. Themes and motifs Inspired by Revoy's childhood in Japan, ANIMUS muses upon themes of fear, captivity, animism, and the old and the new. Revoy stated in a podcast interview that ANIMUS is designed as a puzzle. Reception ANIMUS has received high praise for the quality of its black and white artwork, originality and thematic depth. However, some critics found the plot convoluted and its signature twist perplexing. Paste Magazine highlighted ANIMUS as “[…] a must-read for anyone invested in the next generation of horror hounds” while Kirkus Reviews deemed it “an eerie graphic novel mystery that is bewildering and unnerving in the best way possible.” ANIMUS was distinguished as one of the 20 Best Kids Comics of 2018 and one of the 31 Best Scary Comics For Kids by Paste Magazine. The following year, it was selected by YALSA, a division of the American Library Association, as one of the 2019 Great Graphic Novels for Teens.

Mle 1889 mortars were used in both the First world war and Second world wars. History The Mortier de 270 mm G mle 1885 was one of a series of heavy artillery pieces designed by Colonel Charles Ragon de Bange. On 11 May 1874 three de Bange heavy cannons (120 mm, 155 mm, 240 mm) and two mortars (220 mm, 270 mm) were ordered by the French Army. The mle 1889 was advanced for its time due to being built completely of steel instead of a steel liner and cast iron reinforcing hoops of the previous Canon de 240 mm C mle 1870-87. The mle 1889 was derived from the earlier Mortier de 270 mm modèle 1885 siege mortar and adapted to the coastal artillery role by fitting the same barrel to a different carriage. Variants Coastal Artillery In the coastal artillery role, the mle 1889 was intended to pierce the thin decks of armored warships with high angle plunging fire, rather than piercing their armored belt. The mle 1889 was mounted on a Vavasseur mount which consisted of a large diameter geared steel ring set into a concrete slab behind a parapet. The Vavasseur mounts allowed high angles of elevation with 300° of traverse. The mount was traversed by a worm gear which attached to the base. The mle 1889 was breech loaded with a de Bange obturator, and separate loading bagged charges and projectiles. The recoil system for the mle 1889 consisted of a U shaped gun cradle which held the trunnioned barrel and a slightly inclined firing platform with hydraulic buffers. When the gun fired the hydraulic buffer slowed the recoil of the cradle which slid up a set of inclined rails on the firing platform and then returned to position by the combined action of the buffers and gravity. At the outbreak of the First World War, it is estimated there were 86 mle 1889's deployed in coastal fortifications. During the Second World War 24 guns were still in reserve. The German Army used these as coastal artillery under the name 27 cm Küstenmörser 585 (f). Siege Artillery Although the majority of combatants had heavy field artillery prior to the outbreak of the First World War, none had adequate numbers of heavy guns in service, nor had they foreseen the growing importance of heavy artillery once the Western Front stagnated and trench warfare set in. Two sources of heavy artillery suitable for conversion to field use were coastal fortifications and surplus naval guns. Suitable field and rail carriages were built for these guns in an effort to give their forces the heavy field artillery needed to overcome trenches and hardened concrete fortifications. Although an older design the need for heavy artillery on the Western Front was so pressing that 86 mortars were converted to field use as siege mortars between 1915 and 1917. The conversion consisted of the steel firing platform of the coastal gun being placed on top of a platform made from wooden beams in the field. The mle 1889 could be broken down into three loads for rail transport. Once at a rail station behind the front the mortars could be transferred to narrow gauge rail wagons for the final leg to their firing positions. These narrow gauge tracks were also used to re-position the mortars and bring up their ammunition and supplies. Once the firing platform had been assembled the mortar could be assembled in two hours by cranes and block & tackle. Photo Gallery File:Cuperly.

Description Platyctenids are unlike most other comb jellies in being bottom dwellers. They resemble flatworms in general appearance, being flattened dorso-ventrally and roughly oval in shape. The comb rows bearing bands of cilia, typical of comb jellies, are absent, but the anterior end of the animal bears a pair of well- developed, retractable tentacles that can be extended for feeding. The underside of the comb jelly is a \\"creeping sole\\", formed from the everted lining of the pharynx, and on this it can move over the surface of the starfish. It has irregular red and white markings. Ecology This comb jelly lives symbiotically on the aboral (upper) surface of starfish such as the banded bubble star, Echinaster callosus, and the Luzon sea star, Echinaster luzonicus, although it is unclear precisely how each of the parties benefit from the arrangement. Like other comb jellies, Coeloplana astericola has an extendible tentacular system composed of a pair of tentacles each bearing numerous tentilla on their ventral surfaces. To feed, the tentacles stream out with the current, sensory cilia are stimulated by swimming planktonic organisms, the tentilla extend in that direction and trap the prey. Most comb jellies are hermaphrodites; self fertilisation can occur but cross fertilisation is more common. The embryos are retained in specialist brood- sacs at first, before being released as planktonic larvae. Other members of this genus settle on corals, but this species settles on starfish.

He was a student at the Royal College of Art, a Rome Scholar, a Fellow of the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers (now Royal Society of Painter- Printmakers) and a founder of the Society of Wildlife Artists. James Thomas Armour Osborne was born in Ninfield, East Sussex, Britain in January 1907, the son of a Scottish farmer who migrated to England at the beginning of the century. Throughout his early life he spent much of his time in the surrounding countryside of his parents’ farm, watching and sketching wildlife of every kind. This led Osborne to study at Hastings School of Art, concentrating on sculpture, which he nearly made his career path. During his time at Hastings he won a scholarship to the Royal College of Art where he found that the medium of print suited him better and in his final year made the switch to the Print School, then under the direction of Malcolm Osborne. His talent was instantly recognised and he went on to gain the highest accolade, the Prix de Rome Scholarship in Engraving. In 1932 he returned to England and took a position teaching at the Polytechnic School of Art in Regent Street. In 1937 he married the sculptor Charlotte Ellen Gibson (1902-1994) also a Rome Scholar and a fellow of the Royal Society of British Sculptors. For many years they lived together in a house that had been specially designed for artists by Sir John Belcher for the sculptor Sir Hamo Thornycroft at 2A Melbury Road, Holland Park, London. In 1946 Osborne was elected an A.R.E a member of the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers (now Royal Society of Painter-Printmakers) and elected a fellow (R.E) in 1957. He exhibited regularly with the society. His works were exhibited at the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition twenty-four times between 1936 and 1970. His work was shown throughout regional galleries in the UK and in the US and he was also included within Arts Council touring exhibitions in Europe. In 1964, together with Eric Ennion, Robert Gilmore, Elieen Soper, and Keith Shackleton, he founded the Society of Wildlife Artists and was a regular exhibitor with the Society at the Mall Galleries, London. The first major retrospective of Osborne’s work was held in July 1986 as part of the 25th anniversary of the World Wildlife Fund UK. Harry Eccleston, President of the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers and Engravers said: “Although I have known and admired individual pieces of Osborne’s work for the past forty years, seeing it all gathered together is a revelation. You are suddenly aware of how much he is following in the great tradition of those British artists who have found their inspiration in animals and birds which surround them: Stubbs, Bewick and more recently Tunnicliffe”. Osborne’s works are a combination of colour wood engravings, linocuts and silk screens prints, illustrating a range of wildlife, with a special emphasis towards birds. They are bold, interpretive and large scale, rich in colour and detail. Throughout his career, Osborne constantly experimented with all forms of print and paper and his editions never exceeded thirty. The large woodcuts and linocuts are in direct contrast with the small delicate black and white wood engravings of his earlier works. In addition to the Royal Academy and RWS Galleries in London, exhibitions of Osborne's work have been held at Reading Museum & Art Gallery (1960), Barton Art Gallery, Tenterden (1986 in association with the World Wildlife Fund) Guild Gallery, London (1987) University of Wales, Aberystwyth (1987) Victoria Art Gallery, Bath (1988) Jane Haler Gallery (1988), Darling Harbour Expo, Sydney Australia (1988) The Burton Art Gallery Bideford, Devon (2014) and Nature in Art (2016). Osborne's prints are held in national public collections including The Ashmolean, Oxford, The Victoria and Albert Museum, London, University of Wales Aberystwyth, Cuming Museum, London.

In the mountains classification, points towards the classification were won by reaching the top of a climb before other cyclists. Each climb was categorised as either first, second, third, or fourth-category, with more points available for the higher- categorised climbs. Double points were also awarded for the premier first- category climb on the final stage. Additionally, there was a sprints classification, which awarded a white jersey. In the points classification, cyclists received points for finishing in the top 20 in a stage. For winning a stage, a rider earned 20 points, with a point fewer per place down to 1 point for 20th place. The fourth and final jersey represented the active rider classification, marked by a blue jersey. This was decided at the race's intermediate sprints, awarding points on a 3–2–1 scale. There was also a classification for Polish riders, with the highest-placed rider appearing on the podium each day. As well as this, a teams classification was also calculated, in which the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added together; the leading team at the end of the race was the team with the lowest total time. {   center; font-size:smaller;\\" - style=\\"background-color: #efefef;\\" ! width=\\"2%\\" Stage ! width=\\"14%\\" Winner ! width=\\"14%\\" () class=noviewer ! width=\\"14%\\" ! width=\\"14%\\" Mountains classification () class=noviewer ! width=\\"14%\\" ! width=\\"14%\\" Polish rider classification () ! width=\\"14%\\" - scope=row 1  Pascal Ackermann style=\\"background:yellow;\\" rowspan=2 Pascal Ackermann style=\\"background:white;\\" rowspan=2 Pascal Ackermann style=\\"background:violet;\\" rowspan=3 Michał Paluta style=\\"background:lightblue;\\" Alessandro De Marchi style=\\"background:salmon;\\" rowspan=3 Michał Paluta style=\\"background:navajowhite;\\" rowspan=3 - scope=row 2  Pascal Ackermann style=\\"background:lightblue;\\" rowspan=6 Jenthe Biermans - scope=row 3  Álvaro José Hodeg style=\\"background:yellow;\\" Álvaro José Hodeg style=\\"background:white;\\" rowspan=2 Álvaro José Hodeg - scope=row 4  Michał Kwiatkowski style=\\"background:yellow;\\" rowspan=4 Michał Kwiatkowski style=\\"background:violet;\\" rowspan=2 Jan Tratnik style=\\"background:salmon;\\" rowspan=4Michał Kwiatkowski style=\\"background:navajowhite;\\" rowspan=2 - scope=row 5  Michał Kwiatkowski style=\\"background:white;\\" rowspan=2 Pascal Ackermann - scope=row 6  Georg Preidler style=\\"background:violet;\\" Łukasz Owsian style=\\"background:navajowhite;\\" - scope=row 7  Simon Yates style=\\"background:white;\\" Michał Kwiatkowski style=\\"background:violet;\\" Patrick Konrad style=\\"background:navajowhite;\\" - ! colspan=2Final !style=\\"background:gold;\\" Michał Kwiatkowski !style=\\"background:offwhite;\\" Michał Kwiatkowski !B93B8F;\\" !0049DC;\\" !style=\\"background:red;\\" !FF8C00;\\" } References External links * 2018 Category:2018 UCI World Tour Category:2018 in Polish sport Category:August 2018 sports events in Europe ","title":"2018 Tour de Pologne"},{"id":"57750074","text":"Infrared satellite animation of Hurricane Maria making landfall in Puerto Rico on September 20 Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico as a high-end Category 4 hurricane on September 20, 2017, resulting in the island's most severe natural disaster in modern history. The entire island suffered devastating effects with the entire population losing access to electricity, the majority losing access to clean water, tens of thousands of homes destroyed, and road infrastructure left crippled. A series of cascading infrastructure failures compounded the direct effects of the hurricane. Lack of aid, electricity, water, and access to medical care endangered many people; elderly and poor residents were most impacted. Despite the severity of these impacts, the Government of Puerto Rico reported that only 64 people died in the hurricane. Numerous media outlets harshly criticized the government for suppressing the true death toll. Investigative reporting corroborated these accusations, with The New York Times finding upwards of 1,000 potentially hurricane-related fatalities in the months following Maria. In response to mounting accusations of a cover-up, the government ordered an independent investigation and on December 18, 2017 contracted a study of the death toll by the Milken Institute School of Public Health. In February 2018, CNN and Puerto Rico's Center for Investigative Journalism filed three lawsuits against the Government of Puerto Rico to obtain details on deaths in the months following Maria. Following a court ruling, the government released the withheld information. Statistical data showed an increase of 1,427 deaths in 2017 as compared to the preceding four years; however, the number attributable to Maria could not be determined. On August 28, the Government of Puerto Rico revised the official death toll to be 4,645 people, ranking Maria as one of the deadliest hurricanes in United States history. The official estimate is based on a study commissioned by the governor of Puerto Rico, where researchers at George Washington University developed statistical models showing the number of excess deaths for the time period between September 2017 and February 2018 to be between 2,658–3,290 (with a 95 percent confidence interval). Researchers attributed the low initially reported death count to \\"lack of awareness of appropriate death certification practices after a natural disaster\\" among physicians reporting deaths to vital statistic agencies. Background Downed trees, power lines, and landslides clogged countless roads across the island, leaving numerous communities completely isolated. Relief aid was unable to reach many towns for days or weeks after the hurricane struck. In the decade preceding Maria, Puerto Rico suffered from major financial decline and crippling debt from a combination of poor fiscal management and changes in federal tax policy. In early 2017, the territory filed for bankruptcy as its public debt reached $74 billion. A change in federal taxation policy prompted an exodus of lucrative business and reduced tax revenue; poverty rates reached 45 percent. Aging infrastructure across the island makes the electrical grid more susceptible to damage from storms; the median age of Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) power plants is 44 years. Inadequate safety also plagues the company and local newspapers frequently describe poor maintenance and outdated controls. PREPA struggled with increasing debt, reaching $9 billion before the hurricanes prompting them to file for bankruptcy. Furthermore, the company reduced its staffing by 30 percent since 2012. Alongside being outdated, the electrical infrastructure was built largely above ground and exposed to the direct effects of hurricanes. Much of the island suffered landslides The 2017 Atlantic hurricane season produced multiple powerful and long-lived tropical cyclones. August and September proved to be especially active, featuring three catastrophic hurricanes: Harvey, Irma, and Maria. Timothy Gallaudet, acting director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, described it as \\"a season that wouldn't quit\\". In early September, Irma devastated the Leeward Islands as a Category 5 hurricane and tracked close to Puerto Rico. Although the center remained well offshore, tropical storm-force winds affected the territory and caused substantial damage. The storm weakened the already embattled power grid, and left it susceptible to complete failure. While recovery efforts remained underway in Texas and Florida for Harvey and Irma, respectively, Maria struck Puerto Rico on September 20 as a high-end Category 4 hurricane. The hurricane inflicted catastrophic damage island-wide, decimating the power grid, crippling road infrastructure, and leaving the majority of people without access to clean water. The Federal Emergency Management Agency had little time to prepare and respond, and had shipped out many of the supplies it had stored on Puerto Rico to assist recovery from Irma in the US Virgin Islands. The agency admitted logistical failures, personnel shortages, and communication troubles with the local government vastly hampered their ability to assist in recovery. Inland communities remained isolated for days after the storm struck, leaving the territory's poor and elderly especially vulnerable. Injured persons or those in need of regular medical care (such as dialysis) were unable to access emergency services for prolonged periods of time. Food and water shortages exacerbated the risk of death, especially in inland communities. Initial criticisms In the months following Maria, the official death toll relayed from the Government of Puerto Rico came into question by media outlets, politicians, and investigative journalists. Scores of people who survived the hurricane's initial onslaught later died from complications in its aftermath. Catastrophic damage to infrastructure and communication hampered efforts to accurately document the total loss of life. An electronic database system for reporting deaths was not in existence at the time of the hurricane and most of the internet and communication systems were destroyed. In 2018 a judge ruled that a database should be created and made public with death records. In the governor's published recovery report in 2018, titled Transformation and Innovation in the Wake of Devastation, then governor Rosselló proposed creating a new national electronic reporting system that would hopefully improve accuracy in death reporting after a natural disaster. such as Hurricane Maria. In Corozal, the government listed no fatalities; however, the mayor of the town, Sergio Torres Torres disputed this claim saying he knew for a fact that deaths had occurred. Deaths related to power outages at Manatí Medical Center were not sent to San Juan for examination according to executive director José S. Rosado. He asserted heart attacks as natural causes; however, this is in direct contrast to government definitions, which include heart attacks as hurricane-related causes. In an October 12, 2017 public letter to the Department of Homeland Security, Representatives Nydia Velazquez and Bennie Thompson complained that the death toll was underreported, either intentionally \\"to portray relief efforts as more successful than they are\\", or \\"due to a lack of capacity on the island\\", and requested that DHS immediately evaluate the accuracy and methodology of the enumeration. In contrast, Mónica Menéndez—deputy director of the Bureau of Forensic Sciences—called the claims of hundreds of fatalities incorrect and dismissed them as \\"rumors\\". Secretary of Public Safety Héctor M. Pesquera called claims of meddling with the death toll \\"horseshit\\". In CNN's report, they indicate that at least part of the issue is also related to subjectivity on what counts as a hurricane-related death. Government records and handling Initial reports Governor Ricardo Rosselló with President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump following Hurricane Maria in 2017 During a press conference on October 3, 2017, President Donald Trump applauded the initial low death toll—at the time the government only certified 16 deaths—and claimed it was nothing like \\"a real catastrophe like [Hurricane] Katrina\\" in 2005 with thousands dead. San Juan Mayor Yulín Cruz harshly criticized Trump as \\"killing [Puerto Ricans] with the inefficiency [of relief efforts].\\" Following the visit by Trump, concerns over political motivations in the handling of relief efforts surged. The magnitude of devastation proved to be an unprecedented challenge for relief efforts by the Army Corps of Engineers and FEMA. Senator Kamala Harris claimed that \\"the government failed Puerto Rico at every level in the wake of Hurricane Maria\\". Between September 20 and October 18, the island's only medical examiner authorized 911 bodies for cremation; however, they were not physically examined and simply given \\"natural causes\\" as the cause of death. Official statistics showed increases of about 20% and 27% in overall fatalities in Puerto Rico during September 2017, compared to 2016 and 2015, followed by a decrease of about 10% in October 2017 compared to the previous two Octobers. On November 3, San Juan Mayor Yulín Cruz said that the actual death toll for Puerto Rico may have been as high as 500, which was more than 10 times higher than the official death toll as of early November 2017. By the end of November, the Puerto Rican government maintained that their report of 55 fatalities was the most accurate despite ample contrary evidence collected by media and investigative journalists. On December 9, the official death toll reported by the government was 64; this count remained unchanged six months later. According to Governor Ricardo Rosselló, the government maintained the death toll at 64 in accordance with Center for Disease Control protocols. Through at least June 2018, hundreds of unclaimed bodies remained in morgues, and the island's primary morgue was \\"overflowing\\" with them. A total of 307 bodies were stored at the San Juan morgue and four refrigerators in a nearby lot. Staff shortages resulting from budget cuts further complicated the situation as bodies were unable to be processed in a timely fashion. 2018 lawsuits and corrections In light of mounting evidence contradicting the official government death toll and allegations of a cover-up, CNN and Puerto Rico's Center for Investigative Journalism filed three lawsuits against the Government of Puerto Rico in February 2018. The lawsuits requested the government to release \\"death certificates and related data\\". During court hearings, the government argued that at least some information should be withheld over privacy concerns for the dead. On June 4, Superior Court Judge Lauracelis Roques Arroyo ruled the requested information to be public record and ordered the data to be published within a week. The government filed a motion to delay the release of these records on June 12, citing more time was needed to compile the information due to limited staff and budgeting. However, the court rejected the motion and maintained the original release date. Accordingly, the Government of Puerto Rico released updated death statistics for the months following Hurricane Maria on June 13. Compared to the average deaths in September to December 2013 – 2016, September to December 2017 had 1,427 excess deaths; however, it is unknown how many of these deaths are attributable to the hurricane. Furthermore, the government acknowledged the death toll was greater than 64 but an official revision would not be made until the results of George Washington University study were published. On August 9, a draft of a $139 billion funding request to Congress was reported on by The New York Times. A passage in the document read: \\"According to initial reports, 64 lives were lost. That estimate was later revised to 1,427.\\" The government noted that a series of \\"cascading failures\\" led to the multitude of deaths. The combined effects of Irma in early September and Maria left the entire island without power, the majority without access to clean water, and crippled road infrastructure. The territory's elderly population became especially susceptible to illness and many died as they were unable to receive medical care. In response to the widespread media publication of this, Héctor Pesquera stated \\"This is not the official number of deaths attributable to Hurricane Maria.\\" He reiterated that the official toll would not be changed until the release of the George Washington University study. Accordingly, the document in question was adjusted to remove mention of 1,427 deaths. Journalists from the Assoociatd Press, Quartz and the Center for Investigative Journalism is documenting the deaths in a database and tips can be sent in.https://hurricanemariasdead.com/about.html Official revision, August 2018 On August 28, 2018, Governor Rosselló acknowledged the results of the George Washington University study and revised the island's official death toll to 2,975 people. Rosselló described the effects of the hurricane as \\"unprecedented devastation\\". The governor apologized for mistakes made under his leadership but denied the widespread claims of his actions being politically motivated. He signed an executive order to establish a commission to determine how to implement the recommendations for improving communications and the death certification process. Furthermore, a memorial was to be established in honor of the victims. President Trump's response, September 2018 On September 13, 2018 President Trump began tweeting about the results of the GWU study and his administration's response to the disaster. He called the recovery efforts \\"an incredible, unsung success\\" despite widespread condemnation of its inadequacy. He claimed \\"3000 people did not die in the two hurricanes that hit Puerto Rico\\"—referring to Irma and Maria, and that these reports of large numbers of deaths were caused by \\"bad politics\\" pushed by Democrats to smear his image. Described as a conspiracy theory by media outlets, Trump made these accusations without evidence. On September 14, Trump again disputed the accuracy of the official death toll, describing that the GWU study used an unprecedented and unproven method which created the numbers \\"like magic\\", and questioning how the government of Puerto Rico wouldn't actually know how many people died prior to the GWU study. On this date, a poll of 1,000 Americans by HuffPost and YouGov found that 43% believe that there were nearly 3,000 deaths, while 24% believe that the actual number of deaths were \\"much fewer\\". Of Trump voters, around 10% believe that there were nearly 3,000 deaths, while around 63% believe that the actual number of deaths were \\"much fewer\\". The unsupported accusations by Trump received widespread condemnation from both Democrats and Republicans, with Democrats voicing the most significant criticism. Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL) called his claims \\"shameless and disgusting\\". Former Homeland Security Advisor Tom Bossert stated Trump lacked empathy in his response to the disaster. New York Democratic Congressional candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez expressed ire as her grandfather was among the uncounted victims in the hurricane's aftermath. San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz, who previously confronted Trump numerous times on Twitter in the hurricane's wake, provided the harshest criticism, calling Trump \\"delusional, paranoid, and unhinged from any sense of reality\\". Governor Rosselló offered to \\"walk [Trump] through the scientific process of the study\\" and requested that the President show empathy and respect for the victims. The Milken Institute School of Public Health reaffirmed the results of their study. Multiple Republican politicians from Florida denied Trump's claims, including Senator Marco Rubio, Governor Rick Scott, and former Representative Ron DeSantis. Speaker of the House Paul Ryan stated he \\"[had] no reason to dispute those numbers\\". However, he did not implicate the Trump Administration as a reason for the multitude of deaths. Journalist investigations On October 11, 2017, Vox reported 81 deaths directly or indirectly related to the hurricane, with another 450 deaths awaiting investigation. Furthermore, they indicated 69 people were missing. On October 14, CNN reported the number of missing people to be about 117. A two-week investigation in November 2017 by CNN of 112 funeral homes—approximately half of the island—revealed 499 hurricane-related deaths between September 20 and October 19. Funeral homes became so overwhelmed by the number of bodies that in one instance a facility's director in Vega Alta died from a heart attack. The George Washington University study determined that this heart attack was directly caused by the number of bodies at the facility. Eric Klinenberg, director of New York University's Institute for Public Knowledge, cautioned that the deaths tallied through just funeral homes would still be below the actual death toll as many victims would simply not be sent to such facilities for processing. Comparing average monthly deaths to the reported deaths in 2017, The New York Times calculated an increase of 1,052 fatalities in the 42 days following Maria compared to previous years. Significant spikes in causes of deaths compared to the two preceding Septembers included sepsis (+47%), pneumonia (+45%), emphysema (+43%), diabetes (+31%), and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's (+23%). Robert Anderson at the National Center for Health Statistics conveyed the increase in monthly fatalities was statistically significant and likely driven in some capacity by Hurricane Maria. University studies estimating \\"excess deaths\\" Two scientists at Penn State University, Alexis Santos and Jeffrey Howard, estimated the death toll in Puerto Rico to be 1,085 by the end of November 2017. They utilized average monthly deaths and the spike in fatalities following the hurricane. The value only accounted for reported deaths, and with limitations to communication, the actual toll could have been even higher. A study led by Caroline Buckee and her colleagues at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, published on May 29, 2018, found 14.3 excess deaths per 1,000 people in the four months after the hurricane. The results showed 4,645 excess deaths during this period, a 62 percent increase over 2016. This was calculated through interviews with 3,299 households. Accounting for single-person homes where a fatality occurred, which could not be interviewed, the authors concluded overall excess deaths to be 5,740. Extrapolating the results to the entire population of Puerto Rico would suggest that between 793 and 8,498 excess deaths (with a 95 percent confidence interval) occurred in the aftermath of the hurricane. The Harvard study received criticism over the large range of its results, and The Washington Post criticized media outlets for not conveying the uncertainties in the study appropriately. Donald Berry at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center stated, \\"The results are statistically weak and nearly useless, at least insofar as number of deaths is concerned ... The error is almost as big as the estimate.\\" Steven Kopits of Princeton Policy Advisers conveyed that if the study were to be believed, approximately 3,000 bodies would be missing whereas only 45 people were reported missing by the end of December 2017. Senator Kamala Harris, backed by several other Democratic senators, sponsored the Counting Our Unexpected Natural Tragedies' Victims Act (COUNT Victims Act, ) on June 7 to fund a $2 million study by FEMA through the National Academy of Medicine in order to determine the best way to tabulate deaths from future disasters. The proposed bill would require results to be completed and published by 2020. Harris emphasized the necessity of the act: \\"We cannot allow our government's failed response in Puerto Rico to ever happen again.\\" George Washington University study On December 18, 2017, Governor Rosselló ordered a recount and new analysis of the official death toll. The task of reviewing the death toll was given to the Milken Institute School of Public Health at George Washington University (GWU), with some assistance from the University of Puerto Rico, in February 2018. The goal of the report is to determine the number of excess deaths in the six months following the hurricane. This includes the number of directly- and indirectly-related fatalities. A draft report was to be released in May while the final, peer-reviewed study would be released in February 2019 alongside a review of how Puerto Rico's government handled the death toll. The first phase of the study is expected to cost $305,000 while the second phase, which would include specific case reviews, could cost up to $1.1 million. The Government of Puerto Rico is funding the first phase and the second phase will be funded through grants solicited by the University of Puerto Rico. The study saw delays in progress due to the volume of data to be processed and was released in August 2018. On August 27, 2018, the university published its results, indicating that 2,658–3,290 excess deaths (with a 95 percent confidence interval) occurred between September 2017 and February 2018, primarily driven by the effects and aftermath of Hurricane Maria. The researchers supplied a value of 2,975 as the most-likely number of excess deaths. Dr. Lynn Goldman at the Milken Institute stated that further excess deaths continued to occur beyond February—namely among the poor and elderly—and continued study would be necessary to get a more complete picture of the loss of life. The immediate reasoning for the official death toll remaining at 64 for a prolonged period was pinned on lack of training for physicians in mortality protocol. These 64 fatalities occurred due to the direct results of Hurricane Maria, namely drowning and blunt-force trauma from collapsed buildings and airborne debris. Those charged with documentation of deaths stated that the Puerto Rico Department of Health and Puerto Rico Department of Public Safety did not inform them of Center for Disease Control protocols. Alongside determining the loss of life, the GWU study analyzed the government's activities and preparedness before, during, and after the storm. The results provided \\"blistering criticism\\" of Rosello and his government for inadequate preparedness and personnel training for crisis and emergency risk communication. The Department of Public Safety and Central Communications Office were found to not have written \\"crisis and emergency risk communication plans\\" established. The available response plan was severely outdated and only designed to handle a Category 1 hurricane, far weaker than the intensity of Maria. Limited communications compounded inadequate preparedness, particularly in poorer communities. Furthermore, a lack of communication personnel during the storm hampered attempts to remedy this. Interviews with government personnel identified deficient coordination between central, municipal, and federal agencies. Lack of timely dissemination of accurate information alongside the spread of rumors undermined public trust in and perceived transparency of the government. University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez Two University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez's researchers did a study on the number of Hurricane Maria deaths. Their results indicated the estimated number of deaths caused by Maria between September 20, 2017 and December 31, 2017 (reviewing two months less data than the GWU study had reviewed) to be between 1,069 and 1,568. Their research was published in the journal Statistics in Medicine on July 8, 2019. A judge had ordered that death records by made available and a database containing records of deaths since January 2017 has been publicly made available since mid 2018.

Protesters block the entrance of the Detroit ICE Field Office on June 25, 2018  Background  The protests began in Portland, Oregon, on June 17, 2018, under the moniker OccupyICEPDX after a rally against Donald Trump's \\"Zero Tolerance Policy\\" grew into a vigil and occupation which resulted in an ICE detention center there being closed indefinitely. Protests have taken place at ICE headquarters in New York, and at facilities in Los Angeles, Chicago, Detroit, Louisville, Washington state, and Utah. The movement arose following media reports of more than 2000 children being separated from their parents, after the parents were arrested for illegally crossing into the U.S. via Mexico. The family separation resulted from a \\"zero tolerance\\" policy enacted by Donald Trump in April 2018 as part of the Trump administration's immigration reform efforts. While the protests have been likened to the Occupy Wall Street movement, the first series of Occupy ICE protests seen in Portland were unplanned and organic. The first camp in Portland grew from a rally organized by Jacob Bureros of Direct Action Alliance with support from local immigrant rights groups and attended by local leaders including former Portland NAACP head and current Portland City Councilor JoAnn Hardesty and Oregon State Representative Chris Gorsek. A vigil to honor people who had suffered from the policies grew from participants in the rally and march who stayed and talked about how to potentially have more of an impact.  Protests   Locations  = Portland, Oregon = On June 17, 2018, hundreds of protesters assembled outside of an ICE facility in Portland, Oregon at a rally called by Jacob Bureros of Direct Action Alliance. Following the rally, a group of activists decided to hold a 24-hour vigil to honor the victims of the \\"Zero Tolerance Policy\\" under the moniker OccupyICEPDX. Following confrontations between ICE agents and protesters which were broadcast by Direct Action Alliance on Facebook Live on June 18 and 19, a much larger group of people had gathered outside of the location by the 20th of June and Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced they would close indefinitely following the city police's refusal to respond to calls for assistance by immigration agents who claimed to be in danger, a claim that local police determined to be false (NOTE: the article in reference 8 does not support that the claim is false). Law enforcement officers working for the federal government including Federal Police and ICE agents moved on demonstrators in the early hours of June 28 with weapons drawn, arresting multiple unarmed activists. The protest camp remained after the attempted sweep by law enforcement which only succeeded in clearing the front entrance to the facility, it has been described by federal officials as a \\"very, very peaceful\\" protest camp. The camp had a well stocked kitchen with food and supplies being donated by local residents and many prominent local businesses; onsite child care was available along with basic medical care and even a massage and meditation tent. A 6-ft wooden barricade was constructed by the community to protect the camp from the street. Near to the camp the Department of Homeland Security built a separate barricade with federal police erecting a metal fence around the ICE building on July 2. It was reported on July 5 that three members of the protesters would consume only Gatorade until Portland officials removed ICE from the city in a self- proclaimed hunger strike. Senator Bill Cassidy called for Portland mayor Ted Wheeler to step down over the protests. President Donald Trump also criticized Wheeler. = Greenwich Village, New York = Outside of an ICE building protesters created a rotating group protest outside the facility to call for the abolishment of the facility and an end to the immigration detention center on June 27. The activists stated they took inspiration and networked with other #OccupyICE groups, such as the groups in Portland and Philadelphia. = San Francisco, California = A camp was created outside an ICE building in San Francisco, in July 2018. On July 3 protesters were witnessed blocking the driveway used by vehicles transporting detained individuals, with roughly 35 protesters claiming to not leave until the federal agency is abolished. In the early hours of Monday, July 9, the camp was raided by the San Francisco Police Department. SFPD arrested 39 protesters, injuring several in the process. One year later on Tuesday July 30, 2019, the street in front of the ICE offices was again occupied by protesters advocating that ICE be abolished. A day long event billed as a block party became a tent encampment after dark. The encampment lasted until the early hours of the morning on August 1, 2019, when police arrested 18 persons including one youth, citing them for illegal lodging. = Philadelphia, Pennsylvania = An ICE building in Philadelphia was seen as the site of a camp on July 2, with police acting quickly to disperse the protesters, causing some arrests and injuries. Confrontations between protesters and police continued for five days until the camp was finally raided and moved to City Hall. Protesters have raised demands that Philadelphia end its agreement with the federal government, to allow ICE to access to city police, court and prosecutorial records filed in the Preliminary Arraignment Reporting System (PARS). The city decided to end the PARS contract. = Louisville, Kentucky = Protestors began occupying the ICE offices in downtown on the morning of July 2 with 20 tents. Initially, they had barricaded the entrance/exit of the parking lot for the agency's detainee transport vans. About two hours after the barricade was erected, the Department of Homeland Security destroyed it and several of the tents. The protests continued for the whole day despite this, but protestors were forced to remain off of federally-owned property. As of July 7, 2018, protestors and counter-protestors were still present behind police barricades. On Thursday, July 19, Mayor Greg Fischer and Louisville Metro Police Department forced the removal of the protest. = Atlanta, Georgia = On July 2, it was reported that police threatened to arrest any protesters who didn't move, causing the protesters to move to a nearby private property. Police had previously claimed that protesters had thrown frozen water bottles and kicked officers, the previous day. = Wichita, Kansas = In July 2018, protestors were asked to leave the parking lot of a private office building that had been rented for use of ICE officials. Wichita police officers and Department of Homeland Security Officers told the protestors that they had to leave the property as the owner did not want them to be there. Thus, many of the protestors moved to the nearby sidewalk as it was public property. The building was being targeted as a place of protest as it was believed that it was a detention center for immigrants, although ICE officials claimed that it was an office complex and only housed undocumented immigrants while their paperwork was being processed. = Detroit, Michigan = In June 2018, protestors placed tents in front of an ICE office within Detroit, Michigan to create a home-base, although it was dismantled after five days. Activists at the location claimed demands that included, a shutdown of the nations detention centers, immediate reunification of children with their families, abolishing of ICE, and asylum for all immigrant parents detained trying to enter the United States. In July 2019 it was reported that an anti-deportation group; BAMN was following in the footsteps of about 30 to 40 people who had protested at the office in 2018. The 2019 protests were focusing on the potential harm that any Iraqi Christians would face if they were deported back to Iraq. = San Diego, California = = Tacoma, Washington = It was reported on June 26 that the protest had a typical overnight population of just 20 people, but the group's numbers grow closer to 70 during day light hours. = Los Angeles, California = On June 22, dozens of protesters assembled at LA's Metropolitan Detention Center in protest of ICE. The protest quickly turned into a camp which also effectively served as a blockade to the main bus entrance for the entirety of its duration. On July 2, Councilman Mike Bonin was arrested alongside 17 other protesters while blocking an additional entrance. On September 11, approximately 60 protesters blocked all entrances to the detention center. The activists decamped on September 16, its 87th day, making it the longest running Occupy ICE encampment in the country. Over its course, 24 arrests were made, and the additional entrance was blocked multiple times. The camp continues to hold community vigils for the separated families every Friday evening at the detention center.  Arrests  At least nine protesters were arrested in Portland on June 28, according to The Oregonian. In Philadelphia at least 29 protesters were cited by police for \\"Failure to Disperse\\" outside of ICE offices on July 2.

It is delimited by the subcapitular apodeme (an ingrowth of the exoskeleton for muscle attachment), which separates it from the cheliceral (of the chelicerae, the first pair of appendages) frame. Acari The function or morphology of the subcapitulum can vary within acarines. In its central part, the hypostomal (of the hypostome, a harpoon-like appendage near the mouth) gutter in which the pincers are transformed into a serrated pricking system is formed. The anterolateral parts of the subcapitulum might be equipped with cornicula (horn-like processes) or rutella (hypertrophied setae on the hypostome). At the base of the hypostome, there can be sternal apophyses, that is, an outgrowth or process in the sternum (lower half of the body segment). In Mesostigmata, this happens in the third segment. The frontal edge of the subcapitulum can be provided with paralaciniae (a pair of small processes). In Oribatida, its basal section forms a mentum (\\"chin\\"). In some acariforms, the dorsal part forms a \\"neck\\". In some cheyletoids and myobiids, the subcapitulum merges with the stylophores (chelicerae formed of fused cheliceral bases) to form a gnathosomal capsule. In some prostigmates, the subcapitulum or the whole capsule is referred to as rostrum. Other arthropods The subcapitulum is also present in other arthropod clades. In Ricinulei, an arachnid order related to acarines, the subcapitulum can also be found. In these organisms, the subcapitulum had a subcapitular apodeme and a crescent-shaped mouth, and lacked lateral lips. In comparison with other arachnids, the ricinuleid subcapitulum may result primitive, but it presents a specialization unique of the order; the coxal regions of the pedipalp are enlarged. Another example would be Necrogammarus, an extinct genus of chelicerate eurypterid only known by its subcapitulum and attached pedipalp.

It was released as the fourth song on the track-listing of his third studio album Graduation (2007). The track was produced by West and retains influences from stadium rock, alternative music, and a variety of electronic-music subgenres. It contains a sample from \\"My Song\\" by British singer-songwriter, musician, and poet Labi Siffre. A key development in the song's creation was West touring the world the year prior with Irish rock band U2 on their Vertigo Tour. Afterwards, he sought out to compose a hip hop- oriented variation of \\"City of Blinding Lights,\\" the band's 2005 single. The layered arrangement expresses ambitious orchestrations, with distorted electronic synthesizer that act as the driving melodic instrument. The maximalist synths are further supplemented with a sweeping string section as well as winding keyboards. Its experimental musical composition is also notable for West's rapping technique. His lyrical delivery features a fragmented, forceful flow where he raps minimalist verses in an intense staccato vocal style. Lyrically, \\"I Wonder\\" is an introspective number, containing a blend of melancholic yet inspirational lines that discuss finding one's dreams. The song received general acclaim from contemporary music critics, who hailed it as an album highlight. Even though it did not enter charts, the album track has become a cult classic amongst fans and listeners. West himself actually cited \\"I Wonder\\" as one of his top three favorite songs from Graduation. At one point, he even contemplated releasing \\"I Wonder\\" as the albums' fourth single, but subsequently chose \\"Flashing Lights\\" in its place. Nevertheless, \\"I Wonder\\" has since been certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Although an accompanying music video was never produced for \\"I Wonder,\\" a special video clip was made for the track. The video clip premiered during an album listening session West held for Graduation at the New World Stages in New York City. It was one of seven clips that were designed by West and edited by film editor Derrick Lee exclusively for the event. The video clip for \\"I Wonder\\" features a montage of scenes that are taken from the 1982 science fiction film Tron. West performed the song on the set-list on his worldwide Glow in the Dark Tour (2008). Background Kanye West set out to compose the hip-hop version of \\"City of Blinding Lights\\" by the Irish rock band U2 (pictured) after touring with them. \\"I Wonder\\" was written and produced by American hip-hop recording artist and record producer Kanye West. It was included as the fourth song on the track- listing of his third studio album, Graduation (2007). Although the composition was originally intended to be the album's opening number. The experimental hip-hop production of \\"I Wonder\\" represents a musical progression from the sound of West's past work. Its musical style demonstrates a distinctly European aesthetic, introducing diverse elements and influences from stadium rock, alternative music and various forms of electronic-music, all while maintaining its hip-hop essence. Kanye West claimed that more than any other song from his third album, \\"I Wonder\\" was the most directly influenced by the Irish rock band U2. After spending the previous year touring the world with the band on their Vertigo Tour, he became inspired by witnessing lead singer Bono open stadium concerts each night to incredible ovations. West then sought out to compose rap songs which could operate just as afficiently in similar live venues. During the recording and production of Graduation, West designed tracks in such a way that they would function well when performed in large stadiums and arenas. With \\"I Wonder\\" in particular, West intended to create a hip-hop-oriented variation of the rock band's 2005 single \\"City of Blinding Lights.\\" The song made its live debut on the Vertigo Tour and was used as the opener of the concert set-list. Prior to the release of his third studio album, West frequently spoke of the desire to write anthemic lyrics that listeners could connect to and personalize with, and \\"I Wonder\\" epitomises this ethos. The song's lyrical content is introspective in nature, as West paints a portrait of his reflective thoughts. His philosophical lyrics talk about chasing after dreams and address his rise to fame. In regards to songwriting, West disclosed that he simplifies some of his lyricism on \\"I Wonder.\\" On Graduation, he reconditioned his lines to be simpler, more direct, and more autobiographical in order to make them more accessible to listeners and appeal to the broadest audience possible. For the track, West adopted a slower, fragmented flow to deliver his emotional lyrics. He used similar choppy rapping styles throughout most of the lyrical content on Graduation. He realized after touring with the English rock band The Rolling Stones on their A Bigger Bang concert tour that he could not captivate audiences as well with his most complex lyricism and technical rapping. During an album listening party, West jokingly explained, \\"I'd be saying my super-raps, and this 50-year-old white lady would be looking like, 'I can’t wait till the Rolling Stones come on.'\\" He elaborated that it was a conscious effort not to overexert his rapping on Graduation. West imparted that he felt he too often did so in the past on songs such as \\"Diamonds from Sierra Leone,\\" the lead single of his sophomore effort, Late Registration (2006). West stated that on his third studio album, he made the decision to cease trying so hard to prove himself as a rapper. Recording Henson Recording Studios located in Los Angeles, California was one of three recording studios where \\"I Wonder\\" was recorded. \\"I Wonder\\" was recorded in three different recording studios: The Record Plant and Henson Recording Studios in Hollywood, California, and at Sony Music Studios in New York City. Once the recording sessions were complete, the track was then mixed at the Legacy Recording Studios in New York City. \\"I Wonder\\" is representative of West's stylistic shift in his approach to record production on his third studio album. The music of Graduation had mainly been informed by West experiences touring with the rock bands U2 and The Rolling Stones. West had accompanied Irish rock band U2 as a supporting act for several dates of their Vertigo Tour in 2005 and 2006. He would watch the band open concerts with their 2005 single \\"City of Blinding Lights\\" to rapturous applause, observe how the band's epic, melodic sound filled stadiums, and then sought out to replicate the effect on \\"I Wonder.\\"Shipley, Al. Kanye West's 'Graduation': 10 Things You Didn't Know. Rolling Stone. Retrieved on 2017-09-11. The song's swelling, anthemic energy is the result of West's channeling the legacy of the rock bands in an attempt to attain a \\"stadium-status\\" for his music. In addition to U2 and The Rolling Stones, West also turned the focus of his attention and listening habits towards synth- driven mainstream rock bands such as The Killers, Keane, Radiohead and Coldplay as well as the electronic duo Daft Punk. To further achieve his \\"stadium-status\\" endeavor, West stretched out his production by integrating heavy, layered electronic synthesizers at loud volumes into his hip-hop beats. He fashioned the chord sequence that carries during the song's verses with the use of distorted synth-chords. The layered synthesisers West chose expresses a maximalist aestheic, were directly inspired by U2's \\"City of Blinding Lights\\" and further align with the \\"stadium status\\" description he uses on \\"Big Brother,\\" which bears a similar instrumentation. The liberal use of synthesiser for \\"I Wonder\\" is a trait that the recording shares with nearly every track on Graduation, which served as West's foray into electronic-music. West incorporated a wide variety of audio effects into his production, particularly distortion, feedback, dissonance and reverberation.Pytlik, Mark. 2007-09-11. Review: Graduation. Pitchfork Media. Retrieved on 2009-10-06. The inclusion of these audio components, in addition to modulated electronic noises and rich keyboard tones, contributed towards a harder, denser sonic textures.Greg Kot (2007-08-31). 'Graduation' day arrives: Kanye West exploits his growing pains . Chicago Tribune. Accessed 2007-10-01. West would continue experimenting with abrasive, electronic production on subsequent records, most prominently with the industrial-inspired albums Yeezus and The Life of Pablo. In an interview, West stated that among his primary objectives on his third studio album Graduation was for his drums to bang harder in stadiums. A newfound fascination with house-music had an influence on this endeavor to achieve stronger drum beats. West relied less on his signature shuffling rhymthic patterns and placed more emphasis on clipped electro tones, giving his programmed beats more of a punch. The highly pronounced rhythm section of \\"I Wonder\\" is structured on a combination of thumping boom-bap bass drum and pounding breakbeats. West buried his snares and kick drums deep beneath the decomposing layers of synths into the bottom of the mix. The snare drum that West uses for \\"I Wonder\\" was reportedly heard while he was shopping for furniture at Moss. West was quite meticulous, spending many weeks and roughly ten different recording sessions working on the drum track alone. Yet another stylistic shift West made in his pursuit of sing-along stadium anthems came in his approach to rapping over these beats. When recording his vocals, West placed a significant amount of concentration on speaking at high volumes with fewer words. Inspired by arena tours, he decided to shed his more technical verse-raps in favor of anthemic sloganeering that tens of thousands of fans could chant in unison at concerts. West's sparse array of vocals were also treated with processing, as his staccato delivery is laden with echos. For the track, West utilizes a simplified, halting vocal delivery that is both electrifying and punchy. Despite its experimental nature, \\"I Wonder\\" still happens to be one of a handful of tracks from Graduation which harbor certain characteristics of West's once trademark musical style. It features a soulful vocal sample from the 1972 recording \\"My Song\\" by British singer-songwriter, musician, and poet Labi Siffre. Alongside the nostalgic sample, the orchestration includes elegant piano and lush strings in addition to layered synths.Kellman, Andy. [ Review: Graduation]. Allmusic. Retrieved on 2009-10-06. West continued invoking his habit of layering keys and strings in order to coax the melodies out of samples. The track's keyboards were played by Late Registration collaborator Jon Brion and a full string section was incorporated into the layered, synth-heavy mixes. The lilting melody of the Labi Saffri sample works in tandem with the anthemic ambiance of the lush orchestration and layers of warm yet swelling synths, all over the booming, delay-heavy drums. Although it retains a soulful sample, \\"I Wonder\\" is demonstrative of how the majority of the songs on Graduation don't express the \\"chipmunk-soul\\" once a hallmark of West's productions in the past. West's debut as a hit-making record producer on The Blueprint in 2001 popularized a distinctive hip-hop production technique which involved manipulating the pitch and tempo of vocal samples from classic soul records. West's influential production work on the acclaimed studio album was responsible for helping to revatlize Jay-Z's career and he would later apply some of the soul-based sampling techniques used on The Blueprint into his own solo releases. But overtime, West chose to depart from this signature sound and progressively explore different musical avenues. The minor presence of soul samples on Graduation with tracks such as \\"I Wonder\\" and \\"The Glory\\" served merely to act as a holdover as to not alienate West's core audience unprepared for his increasingly experimental sonic approach. Though he continued to use looped vocal samples on his third album, West now gleaned them before pushing them underneath the synths, causing their voices to sound trapped within a machine. Furthermore, instead of being high-pitched, sped-up and chopped-up, the Labi Saffi sample for \\"I Wonder\\" is used disarmingly straight. Release Kanye West at the Methodist Central Hall Westminster on August 20, 2007 in London, where he first performed \\"I Wonder\\" \\"I Wonder\\" was first heard by music listeners when the digital radio station BBC Radio 1Xtra hosted an exclusive \\"Audience With Kanye West\\" venue at the BBC Radio Music Theatre in London, England on August 13, 2007. It was while West was on an extensive promotional campaign for his third studio album during a trip to the United Kingdom. There West guided a specially selected audience through Graduation, playing the album in its entirety directly from his MacBook Air laptop via a speaker system and eventually came across the track. Kanye West first performed \\"I Wonder\\" live before an audience of well over five hundred fans and invited guests at a concert that he held in secret with Barbadian recording artist Rihanna in London, England on August 20, 2007. The intimate secret concert was held at the Methodist Central Hall in the City of Westminster, with the location of the show being just opposite of the Houses of Parliament. West was the latest musician to be sponsored by the mobile phone companies Vodafone and Sony Ericsson for their ongoing series of one-time gigs all around England. The vast majority of the audience at the small venue was competition winners and music industry insiders. The guests were greeted by staff members wearing graduation robes as well as academic caps in reference to the title of West's third studio album, Graduation. A week later, \\"I Wonder\\" was one of the tracks that West played while hosting an album listening session for Graduation in New York City. The late-night album listening session was held at the New World Stages on August 28, 2007. Inside an auditorium, West explained the influences and aspirations that went into the making of his third studio album. Throughout the night, he played previews of its songs from start-to- finish without interruption, some with video accompaniment to match. In an October interview with Concrete Loop, West imparted that \\"I Wonder\\" was one of his most favorite tracks from Graduation. He stated, \\"My favorite three songs are 'Flashing Lights,' 'Homecoming' and 'I Wonder'. Now, 'I Wonder' is more of an emotional pull. 'I Wonder' and 'Homecoming' are both very emotional, but 'I Wonder' has that stadium thing to it and that has one of my favorite pieces of music: the third verse, the breakdown, when the strings come in.\\" West even went as far to contemplate releasing \\"I Wonder\\" as the fourth single for Graduation. However, West subsequently chose to instead release \\"Flashing Lights,\\" which he describes as the album's \\"coolest\\" track. Composition \\"I Wonder\\" is a mid-tempo hip hop song that lasts for a duration of four minutes and three seconds (4:03). The song incorporates elements to that of traditional R&B; and classic soul music in addition to influences from stadium rock and subgenres of electronic-music including electro, house, and rave music. Its downbeat instrumentation consists of an immense orchestra which sees a combining of West's trademark strings, piano, and samples along with abrasive synths and a distorted drumbeat. An experimental track, \\"I Wonder\\" features a stop-and-start arrangement with gradual, melodic cadence and a stuttering rhythm. West's simplistic yet forceful rapping makes extensive use of rests as the song builds into a bombastic crescendo. Over the course of his three verses, West showcases an untraditional approach to cadence for his leaner rhyme schemes. With a halting delivery, West manipulates his vocal articulation in order to match the melodies of the musical composition. He initially delivers his lyrics in terse phrases at loud volume and high velocity with an intense staccato style in between a vocal sample from \\"My Song\\" by British singer and poet Labi Siffre.Powers, Ann. Hip-hop's Man of Two Minds. Los Angeles Times. Retrieved on 2009-10-06. He enunciates and stresses each syllable in every word within the first minimalist staccato verse, then transitions to a faster, more fluid flow for the more intricate second and third verses. West routinely stops his full-throated rapping and allows the sample, strings and pianos to wander indistinctly for measures at a time. Its musical composition begins at a medium tempo with a graceful, intricate introduction. The track's intro is steeped in lilting melody, consisting of twinkling piano keys and a soft vocal sample from \\"My Song\\" by Labi Siffre. Suddenly, the off-kilter, dreamlike composition erupts, abruptly unleashing an overdriven electronic synthesizer.Brackett, Nathan. Review: Graduation. Rolling Stone. Retrieved on 2009-10-06. \\"I Wonder\\" opens with West proclaiming, \\"I've been waiting for this moment my whole life,\\" accompanied by a sinuous synth-lead over crunchy drumbeats. Its distorted snare drum strokes, crashing rimshots, and a bottom-heavy kick drum combine to form the track's breakbeats. The discordant synthesizer gives off roaring feed-back and intertwines with the melody of the sample, which evolves over the duration of the song to transform into an anthemic, piano-driven refrain. A torrent of dissonant synths undulate as they are ornament with ethereal keyboard lines and throbbing bass. Following the second verse, the synths retract as the song adopts a heavy string section. The operatic strings mimics the melodies of the synthesizer and the vocal sample. At the start of the third verse, the strident synth-lead and later on the piercing drum strokes and rumbling kick drums make their return. Towards its end, the musical composition enters an energetic breakdown. During this period, its snares, kick drums, and keyboards are brought to the forefront before the lush orchestration finish off with a sweeping string arrangement. The lyrical content of \\"I Wonder\\" contains introspection regarding dream chasers, being melancholic in tone. The song features a chorus that pertains to discovering one's elusive dreams. During the verses, West depicts the struggle others experience to figure out their lives. The dark, intimate track is where West finds him alternating from anguished soul-searching to swaggering bravado over the lush orchestration. West varies his highly emotive style of rapping in order to convey the struggle a person goes through in the pursuit to determine the meaning behind their life. During the song's first two verses, when West is in difficult relationship, his rapping unnatural and staggering. But for the third and final verse, when the relationship has been seemingly severed, West returns to his confident demeanor and usual cadence. His lyrics throughout the track engage in a poignant discussion that talks about the burden of expectations as well as struggle in a relationship from an honest perspective. All of which West acknowledges that he once went through before he figured out his own life and found his own dreams. He also takes the time to address the negative criticism that was directed towards him along the way. West ponders on the prospect of achieving success by staying true to one's own unique disposition, while utilising the sample as a hook to ask the existential question, \\"And I wonder if you know what it means to find your dreams?\\" Some music journalists noted a sense of melancholia in the track's lyrical content and delivery that were at odds with its aspirational themes. To Hillary Crosley from Billboard, West's primary goal was to place lyrical focus on individual inspiration: \\"I've been waiting on this my whole life/You can still be what you wish you is, that's what intuition is.\\" However, Greg Kot of Chicago Tribune detected that the at heart of the song lies a crept-in hint of self-doubt: \\"And I wonder if you know what it all means?\\" Todd Williams from The Boombox remarked that West sounds as he's in mired in disbelief regarding his accomplishments in his career and life. Jesal Padania for RapReviews.com concludes that the song's ambivalent lyricism serves to loosely document the miscommunication between West and everyone else around him, while its multiple buzz-lines and his liberal use of Shakespearian open text function to hook the listener in: \\"Do you even remember what the issue is?\\" 411Mania reviewer Sean Comer commented on the storytelling abilities that West exhibited. He states, \\"Kanye always delivers his stories in compelling fashion – it’s just that he’s writing what he knows: his life, triumphs, travails and all. In reality, this was assessment on the state of his fame. Sometimes, it's from a place of bemusement and others, a contemplative resting place.\\" Critical reception \\"I Wonder\\" received acclaim from music critics, who cite the orchestral arrangement and West's soul-searching, staccato delivery as an album highlight. \\"I Wonder\\" received general acclaim from contemporary music critics, many of whom considered it a main highlight of Graduation. Los Angeles Times music critic Ann Powers was intrigued by West's performance, saying that he \\"treats the soulful Labi Siffre sample on \\"I Wonder\\" like a punching bag, his staccato delivery undermining the lyrics' Don Juan come- ons.\\" Comparing it to the single \\"Flashing Lights,\\" Alex Swhear from Uproxx described the track as \\"minimalist in its sparse vocals but intimate and emotionally affecting.\\" Washington Post staff writer J.

Signature vocal-instrumental is illuminating as one can get, and while it’s not one of the more popular tracks of Kanye's best album, it’s certainly a hidden gem.\\" Sharing similar sentiments, Mark Pytlik for Pitchfork Media and AllMusic's Andy Kellman both cite \\"I Wonder\\" as one of the immediate highlights of the third album, with Pytlik calling the song \\"stunning.\\" Louis Pattison from New Musical Express gave an assessment of West's musical style, saying, \\"As well as Daft Punk, Kanye claims he’s been listening to Thom Yorke's The Eraser and you can hear these influences – synthesizers, electronic, but soulful – all over this record. The opening ‘I Wonder’ sees Kanye announcing “I’ve been waiting for this moment my whole life” over zig-zagging keyboards and crunchy Game Boy beats. Commenting on its twinkling keys and hiccuping breakbeats, the music magazine The FADER hailed the composition as the album's \\"most timeless artifact.\\" Prefix Magazine's Jesse Manne remarked, \\"Bursting with operatic string sections and much-talked- about synths, the production on Graduation is truly remarkable. Even on the melancholy numbers, such as the piano-led \\"I Wonder,\\" West turns it out with a crashing beat and winding keys.\\" Japie Stoppelenburg of No Ripcord described the heavy electronic aestheic of the hip-hop production as \\"surprising.\\" He favorably compares its abrasive synth-driven instrumentation to that of the studio album's thirteenth track, \\"Big Brother.\\" In a review of Graduation, Greg Kot, music critic for Chicago Tribune, stated that \\"I Wonder\\" serves to \\"amps up the soul-fired feel of West’s early productions to stadium-rap levels.\\" Writing for contactmusic.com, after panning the album's second single \\"Stronger\\" as the \\"low-point\\" of Graduation, Ben Davis turns around to compliment \\"I Wonder.\\" He asserts that its instrumental exemplifies how the album's \\"superior moments come when West's production really cuts loose on more experimental sounds\\" and voiced his approval of the manner in which he \\"manages to take a Labi Siffre sample and make it sound positively alien.\\" Likewise, Paste magazine expressed fascination with the way that West experiments with unconventional song structure. He stated that \\"the sample of \\"My Song\\" by Labi Siffre does get a bit insistent, but it's overpowered by Kanye's interesting song construction.\\" Regarding West's use of sampling for the record production, Kevin Jones for exclaim! wrote, \\"Where traditional samples are concerned, Kanye transforms more than a few gems into some of the disc’s more enveloping moments, the most prominent being the beautiful Labi Siffre material that serves as the foundation for the catchy \\"I Wonder.” 411Mania's Mitch Michaels lauded the track, saying, \\"After all is said and done, West proves his star power on not just the obvious hit singles, but also on the album cuts. Tracks like the nostalgic “I Wonder” prove why Kanye West is one of the most talented beatmakers and hitmakers in hip-hop today.\\" Rolling Stone music journalist Nathan Brackett opined, \\"As a lyricist, West will never possess the pure cool or formal mastery of his mentor Jay-Z, but he's grown as a songwriter.\\" Calling the record a \\"stomping synth-soul track,\\" Chicago Reader writer Miles Raymer also voiced his appreciation for West's songwriting progression. He observed that \\"I Wonder\\" stands as a prime example of the manner in which West was \\"relying less on old-school beat-and-one- sample combos and more on layered arrangements that camouflage his borrowings. This new subtlety reminds me of Portishead--[West] shows how samples can be used to expand his music's vocabulary.\\" Likewise, Rajveer Kathwadia for RWD Magazine regards West's musicality on the track as the true measurement of his talent, saying the orchestration take center stage over his improvement as a rapper. He continued by writing, \\"Kanye the rapper doesn’t match the quality of Kanye the producer as he uses some disjointed flow\\" but nevertheless labeled \\"I Wonder\\" as probably his most favorite track from Graduation and an \\"immaculate piece of music.\\" Nick Marx of the webzine Tiny Mix Tapes claims that \\"critics of Kanye's staggered half-rhymes will find ample fodder here, but the track's real downfall is its scrap-heap Neptunes synthesizers.\\" Jesa Padania from RapReviews expresses disappointment that on \\"I Wonder,\\" West misses an opportunity for \\"delivering a beautiful and impassioned plea.\\" He critiques that West \\"so squarely aims for 'stadium anthem' territory that by the end of the song, forgets about us and our 'everyman' struggles, instead falling back on his blustery bravado.\\" Jake Boyer of Highsnobiety stated that \\"shows of lyrical dexterity aren’t enough to transform this track into the memorable slow-ballad 'I Wonder' tries so hard to be.\\" Concluding that \\"things just aren’t clicking into place\\" with the track, he faulted its placement on the album in between two of the strongest pop-leaning singles. Commercial performance On June 15, 2018, \\"I Wonder\\" was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for sales of half a million paid digital downloads. At the time, it stood as the only track on the entire studio album that managed to be certified without debuting on record charts in the absence of an official single release (since then, Champion and Everything I Am have been certified platinum and gold on September 23, 2020, respectively). Music video Even though \\"I Wonder\\" doesn't have an accompanying music video, a special video clip was created for the track prior to the release of Graduation. It was displayed for the very first time when Kanye West hosted a late-night album listening session for Graduation in New York City on August 28, 2007 at the New World Stages. The video clip for \\"I Wonder\\" was one of seven that were designed by Kanye West and Derrick Lee exclusively for the event. Derrick Lee was the editor of the music video for \\"Flashing Lights\\" and was able to edit all seven video clips in the span of three days. West presented the gapless playback session inside an auditorium with an evocative light-show across a stage that featured theatrical smoke machines, laser beams, stage spotlights and other special effects. The elaborate spectacle was all set in almost perfect time with the music. While the music played, a large screen positioned in the middle of the stage flashed a sequence of images edited to sync up with \\"I Wonder.\\" They are taken from scenes of the 1982 science fiction film Tron. Kanye West later made the video clip available for viewing on his official blog on March 24, 2008. In the blog entry, Kanye stated that the video clip for \\"I Wonder\\" may be his most favorite out of all the other video clips that were made for some of the songs from Graduation and displayed the night of the album listening session. Live performances Tony Williams (right) deliver the song's vocal refrain. Kanye West performed \\"I Wonder\\" for the very first time before an audience of over five hundred fans and invited guests during an intimate secret show with Barbadian singer Rihanna. The show was held at Methodist Central Hall, just opposite of the Houses of Parliament, on August 20, 2007 in London, England. For the concert, West wore a black jacket, grey tracksuit bottoms, sunglasses and white tennis shoes. After a false start, West leapt onto the stage and began the secret show with a live performance of \\"I Wonder.\\" He was accompanied by a twenty-one piece all-female string orchestra, background vocalists, a keyboardist and his tour DJ A-Trak. The twenty-one women were all draped in plastic dresses while their faces were colored in with fluorescent cosmetic face paint. At the end of the concert, a shower of silver confetti and ticker tape reading Touch the Sky fell from the ceiling onto the audience as \\"Touch the Sky,\\" the fourth single from West's previous studio album Late Registration, was played on the speakers. While instrumentally backed by a sixteen-piece band, West performed \\"I Wonder\\" for a benefit concert promoting and raising funds for higher education. The concert was sponsored by West's charity foundation and was held on August 24, 2007 at Chicago's House of Blues. One of the initiatives funded by the concert is the Loops Dreams Teacher Training Institute, which encourages the incorporation of hip-hop into Chicago Public Schools curriculum. Wearing an untucked white shirt, a purple cardigan, jeans and a pair of sunglasses, West performed \\"I Wonder\\" as the opener of his ninety-minute set. After about a minute, West abruptly paused the track and walked off-stage. He returned three minutes later to perform a string of hit singles from his first two studio albums, starting with \\"Diamonds from Sierra Leone,\\" the lead single of his sophomore album Late Registration. West restarted \\"I Wonder\\" later on and at one point even played a few chords on an upright piano. During a soundcheck prior to start of the charity concert, West met with well over 200 of the local students. West also gave the audience members a sneak peek of the early production stages of his forthcoming Glow in the Dark Tour. In a review of the concert, Chicago Tribune music critic Greg Kot wrote that he was taken aback by the sudden halt of \\"I Wonder.\\" He also thought West's piano playing was under-rehearsed and felt the arrangement was not as fully realized as the song's recorded version. However, Kot still praised the live rendition of \\"I Wonder\\" and remarked that West's performance \\"aspired to stadium-rap heights.\\" The track was included as the second live performance within the set list of Kanye West's Glow in the Dark Tour, which began on April 16, 2008 at the KeyArena in Seattle, Washington. The composition is but one of the many, various songs taken from West's first three studio albums that West uses for his conceptual concert. They serve to form a space opera storyline that details the story (tale?) of how a stranded space traveler struggles for over a year making attempts to escape from a distant planet while on a mission to bring creative back to Earth. In the narrative, West plays an astronaut who performs the song after talking with his robotic on-board computer Jane once his spacecraft crashes onto an unknown planet. \\"I Wonder\\" was among a list of songs that West performed during a 90-minute set when he headlined the annual dance music festival Global Gathering on July 25, 2008, becoming the very first hip-hop artist to do so. We’re teased with a snippet of ‘Stronger’, but after appearing in a puff of smoke, Kanye opts to regale us with ‘I Wonder’ and ‘Heard ’Em Say’. West was accompanied by backup singers, a disc jockey and three pairs of drums while the concert featured a liberal use of lighting and smoke effects. West gave a rare live performance of \\"I Wonder\\" when he headlined the iconic Pyramid Stage at Glastonbury Festival on June 27, 2015 in the United Kingdom. Kanye West's cousin, soul singer Tony Williams, stepped forward from the back of the stage to sing the vocal sample melody. Rolling Stone writer Daniel Kreps describes the live rendition as one of the \\"unexpected gems\\" from the concert's thirty- song set list. Cover versions Detroit rapper Big Sean performed a cover of \\"I Wonder\\" for BBC Radio 1Xtra Live Lounge. \\"I Wonder\\" has been covered and remixed by other hip-hop artists. A remix for \\"I Wonder\\" was produced by Baltimore club pioneer Scottie B for inclusion on Sky High, a remix mixtape that was mixed and compiled by DJ Benzi and Plain Pat. The mixtape features remixes by various DJs and record producers of songs taken from West's first three studio albums. It was made in anticipation of the release of his fourth studio album 808s & Heartbreak. The remix project was commissioned by Kanye West himself the year prior. He handed over a cappellas and other session tapes to DJ Benzi, who then spent his time trying to match different and DJs and producers to certain tracks. Like every of the other tracks, \\"I Wonder\\" (Scottie B Remix) had at least five revisions recorded before being completely finished. The song's instrumental was given a new club-friendly, dance- oriented vibe. In a manner similar, \\"I Wonder\\" was remixed by Terry Urban and included on The Graduate, a collaborative remix mixtape hosted by West. Terry Urban composed the mixtape alongside fellow DJs and record producers Mick Boogie and 9th Wonder. For the remix, he incorporates the second verse of the song \\"Life's a Bitch\\" by the Queensbridge rapper Nas, taken from his classic debut album, Illmatic. Harlem hip-hop artist Charles Hamilton has used various portions of \\"I Wonder\\" for his music on multiple occasions. His songs \\"Independent Woman,\\" \\"My Wonderful Pink Polo,\\" and \\"Wonderful Wondering\\" all contain samples and elements of the musical composition. The song was covered in its entirety by GOOD Music recording artist Big Sean in honor of the ten- year anniversary of Graduation. Big Sean performed the live cover rendition of \\"I Wonder\\" for BBC Radio 1Xtra Live Lounge during the promotion of his fourth studio album, I Decided. Legacy \\"I Wonder\\" directly inspired Raury to pursue a career as a musician. Though never released as a single nor entered record charts, \\"I Wonder\\" has since gone on to become a cult classic amongst fans and listeners. The musical composition has also left a profound impact on other recording artists and musicians. In an interview with The Guardian, while making a list of his most influential songs, the Atlanta musician Raury describes \\"I Wonder\\" as the song that helped kickstart his career. Raury elaborated that West's third studio album Graduation was one of the first albums he ever purchased, and that its songs played an important role in shaping his early beginnings. At the age of nine, Raury was deeply inspired by \\"I Wonder\\" in particular and wrote his very first rhymes that he later went on to rap to his manager over the track's instrumental. He imparted, \\"This was around the same age: nine was a pivotal age for me, I was diving into music. I didn’t even really know who Kanye was, but I bought the album because I liked the bears and the artwork. And I just love music about the imagination and becoming more than who you are. I wrote a verse to it at the age of 14 that I would later rap to my manager, Justice [Baiden], that convinced him to manage me. This song has stuck with me, I still play it today.\\" During an interview with Big Boy’s Neighborhood on Los Angeles radio station Power 106, the Canadian rapper Drake was asked to make a list of songs verses and from other artists of any genre that he wishes he himself recorded. At one point, Drake cites \\"I Wonder\\" as one clear example. Other hip-hip artists such as Vic Mensa and Kyle have also stated that \\"I Wonder\\" is their favorite song from Graduation and regaled found memories of listening to it and the rest of the record. \\"I Wonder\\" is paid lyrical homage by American entertainer Donald Glover — better known as his stage name Childish Gambino — on the track \\"We Ain't Them\\" from his sixth mixtape R O Y A L T Y.

The demonstration was a response to the deaths of Colten Boushie and Tina Fontaine, and the acquittals of the accused in both cases. But the camp also wanted to illuminate systemic racism in the child welfare system and the justice and corrections systems. After 197 days, the camp was permanently dismantled on September 12, 2018. Prior to July 2nd meeting The Saskatchewan government issued an eviction notice to the demonstrators after the security team in charge of Canada Day raised security concerns. Also cited were the violation of park bylaws. They were to leave by June 5 at 5:00 pm local time. Protesters remained on site despite the eviction, having a barbecue and performing a round dance around the teepee. The demonstration was on its 111th day when the Regina Police Service (RPS) dismantled the teepee and arrested protesters. Six protesters were taken into custody, but no charges were made and they were released shortly after. Three days later on June 21, National Indigenous Peoples Day, the protesters returned and reassembled the teepee. The police were informed, but did not engage as there was no complaint filed. By the 26th, there were six teepees total on the Wascana Park grounds. The Canada Day celebration events that were usually done in Wascana Park were relocated to the northern section of the park. The Provincial Capital Commission (PCC), in charge of planning the festivities, asked the RPS to remove the structures, but police Chief Evan Bray reported having no intention of removing the camp unless public safety was risked. Camp protesters responded that the PCC's request for their removal was counter to the attempts at reconciliation since the parties were meeting on July 2 to resolve the conflict. July 2nd meeting On June 26, 2018, a meeting was scheduled between the camp and the provincial government. The meeting was on July 2, 2018, in the glass teepee in Fort Qu’Appelle at the Treaty 4 Governance Centre. To the Ministry of Social Services, the camp requested: transparent reporting on the number of children and their expected duration in care to the public; a review of social services' permanent and long-term wards; replace apprehension with in-home supervision; visit the Red Pheasant First Nation; pause adoptions and expanding the foster care system; include cultural and developmental needs of each child with full reports; implement a review process for all foster homes in Saskatchewan to address overcrowding and harm; and \\"complete a cost analysis on how the ministry is resourcing families so they can stay together or be reunited, relative to costs that are paid to agencies that house children in care\\". To the Ministry of Justice and the Attorney General, the camp requested: an investigation into the death of Haven Dubois, or a broader investigation of practices by the RPS's major crimes unit in 2015; conduct an inquiry into the missing and murdered Indigenous men and boys; and revise the Police Act and the Coroners Act. To the Ministries of Central Services and the Provincial Capital Commission, the camp requested they desist efforts to remove the camp. Finally, to all ministers, the camp requested they \\"strike an inter ministerial round table\\" to meet with the campers in two weeks. After the July 2nd meeting On July 13, Regina's officials released and circulated a response to the camp's requests. The letter responds to each request with what the government is already attempting to do regarding the concerns. The letter concludes by stating the government's expectations for the camp to be disassembled. Responses The Provincial Capital Commission released the following statement in response: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau responded to the issue on the Global News Morning Show while in Regina, saying \\"We know there are a lot of deep systemic challenges within our country’s institutions, and not just the justice system when it comes to reconciliation, when it comes to building a strong future for all Canadians, including Indigenous Canadians. That’s why whether it’s on health, whether it’s on education, whether it’s on entrepreneurship, or whether it’s on issues in the justice system, we have an awful lot of work to do.\\" Similar protests * On March 4, a group of protesters set up outside Toronto City Hall in response to the acquittals of the accused in Boushie's and Fontaine's deaths. * On July 10, Saskatoon's Healing Camp for Justice started its 10-day demonstration and ceremony on Saskatoon's Victoria Park.

The Canadian Pacific Railway commissioned a mural in 1998 to commemorate the historic West Toronto Junction Engine House. In 2001 the City of Toronto commissioned Timetrack in Dempsey Park, and the following year commissioned Third Garden at the site of the former Lakeshore Psychiatric Hospital. Both sculptural public art installations were made in collaboration with artist Warren Quigley. The duo had collaborated previously on Gateway in 1997, a pair of allegorical entrances at the intersection of Spadina Avenue and Dundas Street West that identify Toronto’s Chinatown, a work commissioned by the City of Toronto, Toronto Transit Commission, and Toronto Chinatown Development Association. The site-specific Chinoiserie Room was commissioned by the Gladstone Hotel in 2005. Chinoiserie refers to a style of decorative art based on European imitation of Asian motifs. Chen makes use of this style ironically, poking fun at decorative appropriation and exoticism. The room's effect relies on wallpaper design, which contrasts Victorian imagery with contemporary global references. . Among her numerous awards and grants is a Chalmers Fellowship through the Ontario Arts Council to produce Demon Girl Duet, a dual-screen video installation depicting two river journeys. One follows the Yangtze in China, while another follows the Niagara River, which spans a 35-mile stretch of the border between Canada and the United States. The piece was exhibited in the Canada Pavilion at Shanghai Expo 2010. As the University of Colorado Art Museum's 2018 Artist-in-Residence, Chen produced the installation entitled Millie Chen: Four Recollections as well as egg MUSEUM, in which egg tempera studies of photographic details are juxtaposed with objects from the Museum's collection. Her concurrent project, Silk Road Singbook--which re-traces a Eurasian trading routes--also focuses on narratives of cultural and generational relationships. Chen is represented by Anna Kaplan Contemporary.

Its earliest elements date from a fortress built around 1150. The modern building serves as the headquarters for a vineyard of the same name, and as a venue which can be hired to host social events. It is a Swiss Cultural Property of Regional Significance. History Glerula or Calarona (from , 'gravel') was a Gallo- Roman village. The chroniclers Gregory of Tours and Marius of Avenches described what is now called the Tauredunum event of 563. A landslip into the eastern end of Lake Geneva caused a tsunami which swept along the lake causing immense damage. Glerula was among the villages which were destroyed. It was never rebuilt. Instead, a new community was founded a short distance to the east, taking its name from the new church there, dedicated to Saint- Symphorien. That name has, with the passage of years, transformed into Saint- Saphorin. The end of the 11th century and the start of the 12th were marked by the Investiture Controversy. That turned on whether or not secular rulers had the right to appoint clergymen to senior positions such as bishoprics. In 1076, as part of this quarrel, Pope Gregory VII excommunicated Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor. The Emperor crossed the Alps by way of the Great St Bernard Pass to seek out the Pope at Canossa, where in January 1077 he did public penance and had his sentence of excommunication lifted. He was accompanied by , Bishop of Lausanne, who too had been excommunicated. On his return, Henry gave the region of Lavaux (which includes Glérolles) to the Diocese of Lausanne. In 1150 or around 1160, the Bishop of Lausanne built a keep on the site of the former Glerula, to guard a narrow part of the road between Lausanne and Vevey. The first documentary mention of the castle is in about 1270 or in 1271, when Bishop gave it as a feoffment to Hugo de Palézieux. Around 1300 or in 1303, the diocese reclaimed its rights. The fortifications of Glérolles were improved. The castle served a civil as well as a military purpose. It is recorded that several gangs of brigands were captured near Glérolles and were executed there. On the first floor, there was a device called la cage aux sorcières ('the witches' cage'), a sort of large chest made of thick planks reinforced inside and outside with iron, and having a grille which allowed anyone confined within it only the minimum of air and light. In the late 15th and early 16th centuries, Bishops and made further improvements to the fortifications. The castle acquired the nickname of \\"the Chillon of Lavaux\\". In 1531, the castle lent 10 cannons to the town of Vevey, to fire salutes upon the arrival and departure of the visiting Charles III, Duke of Savoy. In 1536, the Calvinist German-speaking city-state of Bern invaded Catholic French-speaking Vaud, and subjugated it. Bishop Sébastien organised a defence from Glérolles; but was unsuccessful, and fled. In 1798, the Vaudois rose up against their Bernese overlords; and, assisted by the French, threw them out, and established the Lemanic Republic. Grérolles Castle became the property of the people. In 1803, the Emperor Napoleon established the Swiss Confederation, under which Vaud was elevated to the status of a canton. The cantonal authorities promptly sold the castle into private hands. Its ownership has since changed several times. During the 19th and 20th centuries, it was converted from a fortress into a more elegant dwelling. When the castle was sold in 2010, the price was not disclosed, but has been estimated at 15-20 million Swiss francs. Description Vue de Chateau de Glérolle, 1784 Few elements of the mediaeval fortress survive. A 1784 engraving by Jean-Benjamin de La Borde shows a building with a tall quadrangular central tower capped by a pyramidal roof. There is a legend that the tower was demolished in the 19th century because it was casting shade over the vineyard. Although that story does lend support to the idea of a long-standing close connection between castle and vineyard, it is untrue. The tower was halved in height because vibration from the newly built Simplon railway threatened to bring the whole structure down. , the castle comprises 30 rooms, including a meeting hall called La Salle des Chevaliers, and a garden facing onto Lake Geneva which includes a private dock. It is a Swiss Cultural Property of Regional Significance (List B, no. 6491). Vineyard The vineyard consists of of terraces. The grape varieties include Chasselas (which is predominant), Pinot Noir, Gewürztraminer, Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Syrah and (as an unusual speciality) Humagne Rouge. The wines are entitled to be labelled AOC Saint- Saphorin (Lavaux). The canton of Valais has had the sole privilege of growing Humagne Rouge. In or around the 1980s, the owner of the Glérolles vineyard planted some Humagne Rouge vines. The authorities ordered him to uproot them. He complained, heatedly, at high judicial levels, and his arguments prevailed. , Glérolles is the only place in Switzerland outside Valais which has the right to make wine from Humagne Rouge grapes. Wine made at Glérolles has won at least one award.
