The first episode was broadcast on 14 February 1972 on BBC1 as part of Watch with Mother. The show was created by Joanne and Michael Cole, who also created Bod. Only thirteen episodes were ever made and were regularly repeated until December 1984. Presented by mime artist \\"Yoffy\\" (played by Canadian actor Rick Jones), each ten-minute episode told a story centred on a paper finger puppet animal and usually involved collecting various items (such as pebbles or feathers) to make up another object at the end. The finger puppets, each of whom had their own song, included: * Fingermouse - a mouse, consisting of a grey paper cone head with paper ears and whiskers with a grey glove for the body (\\"Fingermouse, Fingermouse/I am a sort of wondermouse\\"). Fingermouse later got his own show, with a new puppeteer, Play School's Iain Lauchlan, called \\"The Music Man\\". The Music Man would tell stories involving Fingermouse, using musical instruments. * Gulliver - a seagull made from a white ping-pong ball (head) placed over a thumb and white gloves forming the body with outstretched fingers as the wings. (\\"I spread my wings.\\") * Scampi - several scampi were made using purple gloves with red heads on each finger * Flash - a tortoise, with a paper shell. (\\"Slowly, steadily, I move at my own pace/They call me Flash though I won't dash/Who wants to run a race?\\") Other animal characters included Enoch the woodpecker, Scaredy the crow, Louise the squirrel, Prickly Friend the hedgehog and Gloria, a white mouse who appeared in the last edition as a girlfriend for Fingermouse. These creatures only made occasional appearances and did not have their own songs. Fingermouse gained his own series in 1985. In this series, the focus was more on musical instruments. One series was made of thirteen programmes. The memorable theme tune went \\"Yoffy lifts a finger, and a mouse is there/Puts his hands together, and a seagull takes the air/Yoffy lifts a finger, and a scampi darts about/Yoffy bends another, and a tortoise head peeps out/These hands were made for making, and making they must do.\\" After filming the last episode, Jones destroyed the mouse puppet while the camera was still rolling. Fingerbobs was referenced in the video of \\"A Town Called Hypocrisy\\" by Lostprophets. == Episodes == The following information has been taken from the Kult Kidz Gold DVD release of the series.

It meant that for the first time in history, an international sport team that had been accepted provisionally was later not accepted definitely. At the same time, it was the first time that a regional sport team (Catalonia) had been registered with the opposition of the state the region belonged to (Spain). The Spanish sport organizations actively lobbied against the Catalonia membership among the members of the assembly. At the Fresno assembly, the membership application was rejected (8–114). However, the Federació Catalana de Patinatge brought the case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (TAS) at Lausanne, which admitted irregularities in the assembly (notably the lack of secrecy in the vote), invalidated the vote, and forced the FIRS to repeat the vote following the FIRS statute rules. An extraordinary FIRS assembly was held in Rome on November 24, 2005, and again rejected the membership application of the Catalan federation (125–43). After being granted a temporary membership, Catalonia played the World Championship B, at Macau, (China), in October 2004, winning it. As a result, Catalonia qualified to play the full World Championship, where it played in the same group as Spain. ==Spain's opposition== Some Catalan media have denounced the pressions by the Spanish government and sport organizations on the members of the assembly . Representatives from Chile or Italy (Sabatino Aracu, member of Forza Italia) would allegedly suffered from such pressions or receive instructions from their national governments. The Czech Republic representative Radek Pavelec admitted that his federation had received pressures from the Spanish government . In addition, a letter of the Consejo Superior de Deported (CSD, the Spanish Council for Sports) to the Colombian federation in which the Spaniards were asking for the vote against Catalonia has been made public. In that letter the CSD stated that the recognition of Catalonia would alter the Spanish sport national unity and would create a wrong precedent. The same letter was sent to some other South American federations . The German representative admitted that she was contacted by the German MP for Sport demanding the vote against Catalonia. Literally he asked her to make sure she was coming back from Fresno with a \\"no\\" against Catalonia. ==Repetition of the vote in Rome== On 29 November 2005, the FIRS assembly, meeting in Rome, he repeated the final vote on the admission of the Catalan Federation of Skating. In this case the method of voting was secret and the president of the Catalan Ramon Basiana was able to defend the nomination.

Booklists primary audience consists of libraries, educators, and booksellers. The magazine is available to subscribers in print and online. Booklist is published 22 times per year, and reviews over 7,500 titles annually. The Booklist brand also offers a blog, various newsletters, and monthly webinars. The Booklist offices are located in the American Library Association headquarters in Chicago’s Gold Coast neighborhood. ==History== Booklist, as an introduction from the American Library Association publishing board notes, began publication in January 1905 to \\"meet an evident need by issuing a current buying list of recent books with brief notes designed to assist librarians in selection.\\" With an annual subscription fee of 50 cents, Booklist was initially subsidized by a $100,000 grant from the Carnegie Foundation, known for its public and university library endowments, and at first mainly contained the briefest 25- to 50-word summaries. In 1913, the Booklist offices were moved from Boston to the ALA headquarters in Chicago's McCormick mansion. By the 1930s the reviews had become more in-depth, and the journal began to include some articles. In October 1939, just a few weeks after the start of World War II, Booklist published an article entitled \\"Books for the 'Long and Calm View': On the Crisis, Its Background and Implications to the United States\\", intended to address \\"the demand for impartial books without the emotionalism of propaganda.\\" Amidst a world crisis, the editor helped library patrons to have their questions answered while presenting various viewpoints. From the 1950s to the 1960s, Booklist reviews were limited to 150 words, generally three long sentences. Reviews were handwritten in pencil on yellow legal paper, edited and typed up for the printer. Artistic design choices for the magazine were minimal, with the only visual change between issues being the plain cover's solid colour. The 1970s saw a great deal of change in the Booklist offices. As adolescent literature gained popularity, a Young Adult books editor was hired. The publication of such books as Judy Blume’s Forever, Phyllis Reynolds Naylor's Alice series, and S.E. Hinton's The Outsiders marked a need to evaluate books not meant strictly for either children or adults. In 1973, new editor-publisher Paul Brawley was the first to print editions of the magazine with recreated book jackets on the cover. Some Booklist subscribers protested the flashy new covers, supposedly claiming they liked the plain covers and the space they afforded for listing potential book orders. Under Brawley’s editorship, beginning with 16mm film strips and spoken-word recordings, Booklist began to accept submissions and print reviews of audiovisual products. During the 1980s and 1990s, Booklist began its Editors’ Choice reviews and its first feature column, “Manley Arts”, by Will Manley. The 1990s issues of Booklist were the first to be composed on in-office computers. The June 2005 issue of Booklist marked the magazine’s 100th anniversary. To celebrate the centennial, the acting editors published a feature article entitled “The Booklist Century”, wherein they chose a book from each year of the preceding hundred to highlight its social impact — ranging from Edith Wharton's The House of Mirth (1905) to the 9/11 Commission Report. Currently, the magazine can be found online and in print. The Booklist editorial team also creates supplemental products, such as Book Links, webinars and the Booklist Reader. Booklist offices are located in the 50 E. Huron building at the ALA headquarters. ==Current masthead== * George Kendall- Editor & Publisher * Donna Seaman - Editor, Adult Books * Sarah Hunter - Editor, Books for Youth * Susan Maguire - Senior Editor, Collection Management and Library Outreach * Heather Booth - Editor, Audio ==Reviews and reviewers== Booklist Reviews Booklist reviews are said to be \\"the haiku of book reviewing.\\" Reviews include a brief synopsis, plus mention of the most successful elements of style. Most reviews fall between 175 and 225 words. Starred Reviews The Booklist star indicates an outstanding title of a particular genre. All starred reviews are approved by the appropriate editor. High-Demand Booklist recognizes that libraries wish to purchase new materials as soon as they become available, and therefore works to review titles as early as possible. The “High-Demand Backstory” symbol indicates titles likely to be surrounded by media coverage and patron popularity. Adult Books with YA Appeal As an additional source for librarians, Booklist reviews certain adult titles and labels them for YA appeal. These materials tend to have young protagonists or themes relevant to teenage readers. Recommendation-only system Since its founding in 1905, Booklist has followed a recommendation-only system. This means that every title reviewed would make a quality addition to library collections. Booklist Selection Policy The editors of Booklist magazine adhere to a selection policy consistent with the Library Bill of Rights. The process of choosing titles for reviews aims to promote readership, never censorship. Booklist Reviewers Titles are reviewed by a corps of librarians, freelancers, journalists, and educators, as well as Booklist editors and staff. ==Other products== Website Booklist Online is the website and archive of the Booklist print magazine. Within the database, subscribers have access to digital editions of the print magazine, an archive of over 170,000 reviews, and a host of feature content. Non-subscribers can read a Review of the Day and sign up for free monthly webinars. Booklist Online was developed in 2005, concurrent with the magazine’s centennial, and launched in early 2006. Blog Launched in September 2014, The Booklist Reader is updated daily with feature content for both librarians and recreational readers. Articles often link to reviews found on Booklist Online. Book Links A quarterly supplement to Booklist that is free to Booklist subscribers, Book Links magazine helps educators and youth librarians design topical literature- based curriculum. Book Links provides thematic bibliographies with related discussion questions and activities, author and illustrator interviews and essays, and articles written by educators on practical ways to turn children on to reading. Each issue includes specific suggestions for tying Common Core State Standards to books featured in the publication. Published in September, November, January, and April, each Book Links issue focuses on a different core curriculum area, including social studies, multicultural literature, language arts, and science. Book Links articles from October 2009 onward are available to Booklist subscribers on Booklist Online. Webinars Booklist hosts 3-5 webinars per month with varying subject matter.

Booklist itself sponsors three main awards: the Michael L. Printz Award for Excellence in Young Adult Literature, the Andrew Carnegie Medals for Excellence in Fiction and Nonfiction, and the Odyssey Award for Excellence in Audiobook Production.

It was released in Spring 2006 and is the sequel to the children's novel Chasing Vermeer. It chronicles how Calder, Petra, and Tommy strive to save the Robie House in their neighborhood, Hyde Park, Chicago. The underlying plot elements include 3-D pentominoes, Frank Lloyd Wright, the Robie House Fibonacci numbers, The Invisible Man, and mysterious occurrences. A sequel, The Calder Game, was published in 2008. ==Origins and inspiration== The Wright 3 is the sequel to Balliett's second novel, Chasing Vermeer. She debated on writing a sequel as she walked around Hyde Park, and the Robie House stood out to her. Balliett was inspired by the number 3, as it appeared in the triangles of Wright's windows on the Robie House. She then thought about how it was hard to communicate equally with three people and tried to weave the two together. ==Synopsis== The Robie House Calder's friend Tommy Segovia, who moved away a year before, has moved back to Hyde Park, Chicago. He is immediately jealous of Calder and Petra as they received the \\"glory\\" of saving a Vermeer painting in the previous book (Chasing Vermeer). Tommy feels that he deserves something as well. In his first new day of class, Ms. Hussey announces that the world-famous Robie House is soon to be demolished, which she considers to be murder. The class takes a field trip to the house, and both Calder and Petra discover that there are many secrets concerning the building that they were not aware of. After Tommy learns to tolerate Petra, the three (who call themselves 'The wright 3') work to save the house, even breaking into it toward the end. Tommy finds a fish talisman in the Robie House garden and realizes it is worth a lot of money. Finally, after saving their own lives against a band of robbers in the Robie house, they manage to save that of the house. ===Illustrations=== In a few illustrations, there is a drawing of a fish (referring to Frank Lloyd Wright's lucky talisman) that he lost while building the Robie House. They appear in some chapters with the fibonacci sequence. On one of the last illustrations, a dragon can be found, expressing the change from carp to dragon in the story. Toward the bottom of the last picture there are footprints from the invisible man. In some images, a face could be spotted. ==Critical reception== Adam Liptak in a review for The New York Times praised Helquist's work, but noted an \\"overstuffed narrative\\", although the loose ends could be perceived as charming or frustrating. He also pointed out that too much of the book seemed devoted on the relationship between Tommy and Petra and the climax was reminiscent of cartoons. Kirkus Reviews was more positive toward the \\"tense struggle to transform from duo to trio\\" and gave a starred review. BookPage also left a positive review, praising the \\"framework\\" of the novel. The website Kidsreads praised the plot twists and coincidences. Children's Literature reviewer Erin Pelletier claimed The Wright 3 would \\"not disappoint readers\\" and thought the Robie House was \\"woven beautifully throughout the book\\". ===Awards=== Kaden Enterprises, a game puzzle company, awarded Balliett their Annual Pentomino Excellence Award for her use of the tool in Chasing Vermeer and The Wright Three. The award incorporated the F, L, and W pentominoes (the initials of Frank Lloyd Wright). ==References== Category:2006 American novels Category:American children's novels Category:Novels set in Chicago Category:Frank Lloyd Wright Category:2006 children's books ","title":"The Wright 3"},{"id":"3234650","text":"Strategic Information Technology Ltd.

The systematic name is S-adenosyl 3-(methylthio)propylamine:putrescine 3-aminopropyltransferase and it belongs to the group of aminopropyl transferases. It does not need any cofactors. Most spermidine synthases exist in solution as dimers. == Specificity == With exception of the spermidine synthases from Thermotoga maritimum and from Escherichia coli, which accept different kinds of polyamines, all enzymes are highly specific for putrescine. No known spermidine synthase can use S-adenosyl methionine. This is prevented by a conserved aspartatyl residue in the active site, which is thought to repel the carboxyl moiety of S-adenosyl methionine. The putrescine-N-methyl transferase whose substrates are putrescine and S-adenosyl methionine and which is evolutionary related to the spermidine synthases lacks this aspartyl residue. It is even possible to convert the spermidine synthase by some mutations to a functional putrescine- N-methyltransferase. == Mechanism == It is assumed that the synthesis of spermidine follows the Sn2 mechanism. There is some uncertainty if the reaction occurs via a ping-pong or via a ternary-complex mechanism. Some kinetic data, but not all, suggest a ping-pong mechanism, while the investigation of the stereochemical path of the reaction argues for a ternary- complex mechanism. Prior to the nucleophilic attack of the putrescine onto the S-adenosylmethioninamine the putrescine has to be deprotonated rendering the nitrogen nucleophilic since the putrescine is protonated at physiological pH and is therefore inactive. == Inhibitors == The spermidine synthase can be inhibited by a wide variety of analogues of putrescine, S-adenosyl methioninamine and transition state analogues as Adodato (for further information see here) == See also == * Spermine synthase * Adenosylmethionine decarboxylase == References == == External links == * Spermidine synthase at BRENDA * Spermidine synthase at ExPASy * Category:EC 2.5.1 ","title":"Spermidine synthase"},{"id":"3234664","text":"Michális Dórizas (; April 16, 1886 – October 21, 1957) was a Greek athlete who competed in throwing events at the 1906, 1908 and 1912 Summer Olympics.

The cardinal was often referred to as the \\"Rock of Croatia\\" known for his defense of human rights and his urgings of peace and forgiveness during the independence conflict and the Bosnian War. Kuharić was also a vocal supporter of the cause for the canonization of Cardinal Alojzije Stepinac (who had ordained him as a priest in 1945) and worked to rehabilitate the image of the cardinal during his episcopate while working towards Stepinac's 1998 beatification held in Zagreb. His cause for canonization commenced on 11 March 2012 and he has been titled as a Servant of God. ==Life== Cardinal Kuharić (right) alongside Pope John Paul II (left) and Cardinal Jean-Marie Lustiger (middle) in 1997. Franjo Kuharić was born on 15 April 1919 in Pribić as the thirteenth and final child born to his poor parents Ivan Kuharić and Ana Blažić. He underwent his theological and philosophical education - the prerequisites for the priesthood - in Zagreb at the college there and had begun on 10 June 1939; his education was completed in 1945. He received his solemn ordination to the priesthood in mid-1945 in the Zagreb Cathedral from Alojzije Stepinac and began his pastoral work in Zagreb from 1945 until 1964. His first pastoral assignment after his ordination was to serve as a chaplain in small villages surrounding Zagreb before Stepinac sent him as a pastor to the Radoboja village. In 1964 the prelate became the Titular Bishop of Meta in addition to becoming one of the archdiocese's auxiliaries. He received his episcopal consecration as a bishop in mid-1964 from Franjo Šeper in the archdiocesan cathedral. In 1964 and in 1965 he attended - as a bishop - the last two sessions of the Second Vatican Council as a Council Father. In 1969 he was made the apostolic administrator for the archdiocese after Cardinal Šeper was summoned to Rome to assume a new position which put Kuharić in charge of the archdiocese as its interim head. The decisive moment in his episcopate came in 1970 - ending the interim administration - after Pope Paul VI named Kuharić as the newest Archbishop of Zagreb. It was following his appointment that his alma mater awarded him a doctorate in 1970. Kuharić also served as the President of the Yugoslavian Episcopal Conference from 1970 until 1993 when the conference was abolished in light of the creation of a Croatian conference; he led that from its inception until 1997. The next decisive moment came in 1983 after Pope John Paul II elevated him into the cardinalate as the Cardinal-Priest of San Girolamo dei Croati. He retired from his see after over two decades of service in mid-1997 and soon after lost the right to participate in a future papal conclave after he turned 80 in 1999. In 1991 the conflict over independence broke out and Kuharić pleaded for peace and forgiveness on both sides while asking both sides to negotiate for the good of the nation. He reiterated the same thing during the Bosnian War later that decade. The cardinal also criticized the corruption of the government of President Franjo Tuđman though the cardinal's opponents charged that the latter was too close to some of the president's allies. The cardinal hosted John Paul II in the archdiocese upon the latter's 1994 visit and also hosted the pope once more in 1998 for the beatification of Cardinal Stepinac. He made a range of international trips to visit overseas Croatian Catholics. His first such visit was to both the United States of America and Canada from 14 October to 22 November 1970. He made one visit to South America as well as two to South Africa and three to Australia. He made eight visits in total to both the United States in Canada (the 1970 trip being the first). Kuharić had been ill for some time before he died at 4:20am on 11 March 2002 in Zagreb in the archdiocesan palace due to cardiac arrest (according to the apostolic nuncio Giulio Einaudi); his funeral was celebrated on 14 March and remains were interred in the metropolitan cathedral and rests close to the tombs of his two immediate predecessors. John Paul II - in a telegram of condolence - said that \\"he gave consistent witness of Christ\\" through his actions and set about \\"infusing confidence and courage in the faithful\\" during times of struggle. President Stjepan Mesić - in a letter to the Zagreb archdiocese - said that \\"he preached peace\\" as a central message of his episcopal life. ==Recognition== 80px In 1998 he was honored with the Grand Order of Queen Jelena. ==Beatification process== Kuharić's successor - Josip Bozanić - announced that the cause for his predecessor's beatification would be opened in the archdiocese; this process opened a decade following the cardinal's death on 11 March 2012. The first and current postulator for this cause is Monsignor Juraj Batelja. ==Positions== ===Medjugorje=== Kuharić was vocal regarding the status of Medjugorje and once declared that \\"we therefore leave this aspect for further investigation. The Church is in no hurry\\".Glas Koncila (the Croatian Catholic Newspaper), 15 August 1993. The cardinal said that the Croatian Episcopal Conference deemed \\"Medjugorje as a holy place, as a shrine\\" though said further research was needed to make a full decision regarding Medjugorje's status. ===Ecumenism=== The cardinal was open to dialogue with other faiths and was receptive to meeting with interfaith leaders during his episcopal tenure. He met several times with the Patriarch Pavle from the Serbian Orthodox Church to discuss ongoing relations between the two Churches. ==References== ==External links== * Hagiography Circle * Catholic Hierarchy * Encyclopedia Britannica Category:1919 births Category:2002 deaths Category:20th-century cardinals Category:20th-century Croatian people Category:20th-century Roman Catholic archbishops Category:20th-century venerated Christians Category:Archbishops of Zagreb Category:Bishops appointed by Pope Paul VI Category:Burials at Zagreb Cathedral Category:Cardinals created by Pope John Paul II Category:Croatian cardinals Category:Grand Order of Queen Jelena recipients Category:Participants in the Second Vatican Council Category:People from Krašić Category:Servants of God Category:University of Zagreb alumni ","title":"Franjo Kuharić"},{"id":"3234675","text":"Nicky George Nicolau (born 12 October 1983) is an English footballer of Greek Cypriot origin who plays as a midfielder.

Formed in 1996, the band featured Irish vocalist Davey MacManus, English guitarist Daniel Harris, English bassist Richard Carter and Welsh drummer Owen Hopkin. The Crocketts were signed to Blue Dog Records and released two studio albums: We May Be Skinny & Wirey in 1998 and The Great Brain Robbery in 2000. After the band split up in 2002, MacManus and Hopkin went on to form The Crimea. ==History== ===1996–1999: Formation and debut album=== The Crocketts formed in late 1996 while band members Davey MacManus, Daniel Harris, Richard Carter and Owen Hopkin were attending Aberystwyth University. During their time at the university, MacManus studied countryside management, Harris studied mathematics, Carter studied zoology, and Hopkin studied minority language broadcasting. An early lineup of the band known as The Crocketts 20th Century Vikings featured Graham Salisbury in place of Hopkin, in addition to second vocalist Hannah Fowler; they released an EP in 1996 entitled Frog on a Stick. Shortly after forming the band, each member also created a nickname by which to be credited: MacManus used \\"Davey Crockett\\" (the inspiration for the band's moniker), Harris used \\"Dan Boone\\", Carter used \\"Rich Turpin/Wurzel\\" and Hopkin used \\"Owen Cash\\". After finishing university, the group signed with Blue Dog Records (a sub-label of V2 Records) and released their debut extended play (EP), Hello & Good Morning, in September 1997; the song \\"Stunner\\" from the EP received airplay on the animated television series Daria, while the song \\"Will You Still Care\\" was named by Kerrang! as their \\"Song of the Week\\" in 1997. The rest of the year was spent touring and recording. On 9 March 1998, the band released the first single from their upcoming debut album, \\"Loved Ya Once\\", which registered on the UK Singles Chart at number 181.UK Singles Chart peak positions for The Crocketts singles: *\\"Loved Ya Once\\" and \\"Flower Girl\\": *All other singles: This was followed on 11 May by a second single, \\"Flower Girl\\", which peaked at number 185 on the chart. The band toured England through April and May, before releasing their debut full-length album We May Be Skinny & Wirey on 14 September 1998. The album, produced by David M. Allen, was generally well received by critics; a review in music magazine NME praised the album for its \\"hard and curdle folk melodies with Davey [MacManus]'s splendidly Americanised primal howl and an intriguing array of influences\\". \\"Explain\\" was released as the final single from We May Be Skinny & Wirey on 26 October, although it failed to register on the UK Singles Chart. ===1999–2001: The Great Brain Robbery=== Returning to the studio in 1999, The Crocketts released their fourth single, \\"James Dean-esque\\", on 10 May 1999. Music magazine Kerrang! awarded the single its maximum rating of five Ks, describing the track as \\"classy punk 'n' roll\\", highlighting its lyrics, and also praising its B-sides. The single also became the band's first to reach the top 100 on the UK Singles Chart, peaking at number 87 on the UK Singles Chart. On 25 October, the band released their second EP, Nintendo Fallacy, and toured throughout October and November in promotion of the release. Between late March and early April 2000, the band completed a four-night residency at The Kashmir Klub in London, the final date of which saw the release of the band's next single and music video, \\"Host\\", on 3 April. \\"Host\\" reached number 82 on the UK Singles Chart. The residency included a number of themed nights, including activities such as \\"Crockaoke\\" and a quiz night, which Hopkin explained was done to attract people from the music industry to the shows. The follow-up to the group's first album, The Great Brain Robbery, was released two weeks later on 17 April. The release received praise from publications including Kerrang! and Welsh Bands Weekly, who called it \\"eclectic, moving and passionate\\" and \\"fucking amazing\\", respectively; although it also drew criticism from Melody Maker and NME, who called it a \\"crock of shit\\" and \\"embarrassing\\", respectively. Speaking to Welsh Bands Weekly about the Melody Maker review, MacManus claimed that writer Daniel Booth was \\"famous for picking on a band and attacking them ... he just picked us\\", and that bad reviews did not affect the band as \\"everyone gets bad reviews\\". After performing on a Kerrang! sponsored tour through May and June, The Crocketts released the second single from The Great Brain Robbery, \\"On Something\\", on 3 July 2000. In their review of the single, Kerrang! praised the \\"poetic verses\\" and \\"crashing crescendo of a chorus\\" of the song, claiming that it \\"could well be the single that gets them started [on the charts]\\". It charted at number 90 in the UK. The band returned to touring in September on the Nuke Ibitha Tour in support of the third single from The Great Brain Robbery, \\"1939 Returning/Chicken vs. Macho\\", released at the end of the tour on 16 October. The double A-side single reached number 94 on the UK Singles Chart. The band faced controversy at the end of the year, as frontman MacManus was at the centre of an investigation into a bottling incident at a London club on 12 December 2000 which left a man requiring cuts to his face, after a row said to have started due to the victim's negative remarks about the band. The band recorded and toured throughout early to mid 2001, including a support slot at a pair of Stereophonics stadium shows in July. ===2001–2002: Breakup and The Crimea=== Davey MacManus (pictured) and Owen Hopkin formed The Crimea in 2002. In late 2001, V2 Records dropped 23 of their 60 acts, including The Crocketts, leaving the band without a label. Hopkin filled in for Stereophonics drummer Stuart Cable on the band's tour of Japan in January 2002, after Cable returned home to Wales due to \\"family reasons\\", and in March the group lost Carter, who decided to leave. The remaining three members later recorded an EP under the name Klutzville, before Harris also left in May and the band officially broke up. At the time of their breakup, The Crocketts had been recording material for a planned third album, but the departure of Harris was described as a \\"tragic and unforeseen blow\\" which signalled the end of the band. Shortly after the breakup of The Crocketts, MacManus and Hopkin returned with a new band, The Crimea, and recorded their first album quickly. In a letter sent to the press, the band proclaimed that \\"The beast with two backs is back ... If The Crocketts were four cavemen banging stones together, this is the sound of four Tchaikovskys banging Kylie Minogue\\". The group were signed to Warner Bros.

Haematein should not be confused with haematin, which is a brown to black iron-containing pigment formed by decomposition of haemoglobin. In the Colour Index (but nowhere else), haematein is called haematine. ==Properties== Hematein exhibits indicator-like properties, being blue and less soluble in aqueous alkaline conditions, and red and more soluble in alcoholic acidic conditions. Dissolved haematein slowly reacts with atmospheric oxygen, yielding products that have not found applications. ==Applications== In acidic solutions, complexes of hematein with metals (usually aluminium or iron, but also chromium, zirconium and several others) are used as biological stains. Aluminium-haematein (haemalum) is the \\"routine\\" stain for cell nuclei in sections of human and other animal tissues. Metal- haematein stains are available also for objects other than nuclei, including myelin sheaths of nerve fibres and various cytoplasmic organelles. The color of the stained objects depends on the salt used. Aluminium-haematein complexes are usually blue, whereas ferric complexes are very dark blue or black. Aluminium-haematein complexes (haemalum) bind to the chromatin of the nuclei of cells. Although haemalum staining methods have been in use since the 1860s, the chemical identity of the substance or substances that bind the dye-metal complex is still not known with certainty. Some histochemical investigations clearly indicate that a cationic aluminium-haematein complex is attracted to the phosphate anions of DNA. Others implicate the arginine residues of nuclear histones as the substrate of nuclear staining by haemalum. Structures that stain with aluminium-hematein (haemalum) are often said to be basophilic, but the staining mechanism is not as simple as for basic (cationic) dyes with smaller molecules. Truly basophilic structures are ones containing nucleic acids or other polyanions such as glycosaminoglycans of extracellular matrix or acidic glycoproteins in many types of mucus. As usually used, aluminium- hematein stains only nuclear chromatin and a few other materials such as keratohyalin granules and calcified deposits. Very dilute solutions of aluminium-haematein, used at pH 3.2 (higher than is usual for staining), contain a cationic dye-metal complex and will slowly stain nucleic acids. Haemalum solutions used for routine staining are more concentrated and more acidic (pH 2-2.5) and are able to stain nuclei after chemical or enzymatic extraction of DNA and RNA from the tissue. ==References== Category:Staining dyes Category:Phenol dyes Category:Catechols Category:Tertiary alcohols Category:Cyclopentenes ","title":"Hematein"},{"id":"3234721","text":"Out of the Blue is the debut of Claudia Carawan, and derives its sound from several styles including soul, old school R&B;, reggae and jazz.

The beginning of Kuznetsov’s fall came when Stalin demoted him and returned him to a minor post in Leningrad (a frequent sign that the subject was destined for a final fall).

The field umpire (in orange) is about to signal \\"holding the ball\\" to penalise the player in possession and award a free kick to the first tackler. Holding the ball is an infraction in Australian rules football. The rule results in a free kick being awarded against a player if they fail to correctly dispose of the football upon being tackled by an opponent, although not under all circumstances. The rule provides the defending team a means to dispossess a player who is running with the football, as well as preventing players from slowing the play. The holding the ball rule dates to the formative years of the game. It has a long history as one of the most contentious rules in the game and one of the most difficult to umpire consistently, in large part due to the several points of umpire discretion involved in its interpretation. ==Official rules== Under the 2018 release of the Laws of Australian Football, holding the football is covered by Law 15.2.3 through 15.2.5. Three specific variations of the rule apply depending upon how the player came to be in possession of the ball. The wording of these variations in the laws is as follows: *15.2.3 Holding the football - Prior Opportunity/No Prior Opportunity **(a) Where the field Umpire is satisfied that a Player in possession of the football: ***(i) has had a prior opportunity to dispose of the football, the field Umpire shall award a Free Kick against that Player if the Player does not Correctly Dispose of the football immediately when they are Correctly Tackled; ***(ii) has not had a prior opportunity to dispose of the football, the field Umpire shall award a Free Kick against that Player if, upon being Correctly Tackled, the Player does not Correctly Dispose or genuinely attempt to Correctly Dispose of the football after being given a reasonable opportunity to do so. *15.2.5: Diving on top of the football **where a player is in possession of the football by reason of diving on top of or dragging the football underneath their body, the field umpire shall award a free kick against that player if they do not immediately knock the football clear or correctly dispose of the football when correctly tackled. Although the name of the rule is \\"holding the football\\", cases where the ball is dropped or otherwise illegally lost come under the same rule; this is sometimes informally referred to as \\"dropping the ball\\". Cases where the football is thrown or disposed of in another illegal manner are penalised under the \\"Incorrect Disposal\\" law (Law 15.3.2). The umpire signals holding the ball by leaning forward and sweeping both arms below his body and out to his sides. Customarily, spectators will shout \\"Ball!\\" when they believe a holding the ball free kick should be paid. ===Points of discretion=== Although it is commonly understood that a player assumes prior opportunity at some stage shortly after he has taken possession of the ball, the Laws of the Game do not explicitly define what constitutes a prior opportunity. Defining and interpreting the prior opportunity is left to the discretion of the umpires, acting on the direction of the umpiring coaches. Under the directions given by the AFL umpires coach in 2015, the cues an umpire should use to determine whether or not a prior opportunity exists are: is the player balanced and steady with the football; has the player chosen to break or fend away a tackler, or; has the player chosen to ignore a reasonable opportunity to dispose of the ball. Likewise, there are no explicit definitions within the rules for what constitutes a \\"reasonable opportunity\\" to dispose of the ball when a player has had no prior opportunity, nor what constitutes a \\"genuine attempt\\" to dispose of the ball. As is the case for prior opportunity, the umpires can determine this at their discretion and at the direction of the umpiring coaches. ===Additional interpretations=== Other than the basic rules outlined above, the Laws of the Game outline several other specific stipulations relating to the holding the ball rule. ;Scenarios which are specifically not considered to be holding the ball *(a) a Player is bumped and the football falls from the Player's hands; *(b) a Player's arm is knocked which causes the Player to lose possession of the football; *(c) a Player's arms are pinned to their side by an opponent which causes the Player to drop the football, unless the Player has had a prior opportunity to Correctly Dispose of the football, in which case Law 15.2.3 (a) shall apply; *(d) a Player, whilst in the act of Correctly Disposing of the football, is swung off-balance and does not make contact with the football by either foot or hand, unless the Player has had a prior opportunity to Correctly Dispose of the football, in which case Law 15.2.3 (a) shall apply; or *(e) a Player is pulled or swung by one arm which causes the football to fall from the Player's hands, unless the Player has had a prior opportunity to Correctly Dispose of the football, in which case Law 15.2.3 (a) shall apply. In the latter three cases, a player with prior opportunity who was caught in such a manner would concede a free kick. Otherwise, no free kick would be paid for any of these scenarios. ;Scenarios specifically defined as 'prior opportunity' *15.2.3 (a) (iii) has driven their head into a stationary or near stationary opponent, the Player shall be regarded as having had prior opportunity. ;Ball held to a player Law 15.2.6 clarifies that the holding the ball rules should not be interpreted any differently if the tackler holds the football to the body of the player in possession of the ball. In this scenario, the player with the ball pinned to him is still required to correctly dispose of the ball if he is tackled with prior opportunity, or must make a genuine attempt to dispose of the ball if tackled without prior opportunity, to avoid conceding a free kick; the fact that the actions of the tackler make it impossible for him to effect a disposal does not change these requirements. ;Running bounces and handpasses to oneself Law 15.2.2 specifies that a player who is executing a running bounce or is handpassing to himself without the ball touching the ground is still considered to be in possession of the ball, even when it is not in his hands. The practical consequence of this law is that a player who executes either of these skills while being tackled is automatically considered to be holding the ball under the prior opportunity rule. ==Contention== Holding the ball, and at times its pairing with the holding the man rule, has been one of the most contentious rules in Australian rules football throughout almost the entire history of the sport, for a wide variety of reasons. Confusion and inconsistency are the chief causes of this contention, which in large part arises from the many different facets of the rule, the amount of discretion and judgement umpires must exercise, the fact that different field umpires may interpret the same scenario in different manners, and the lack of formal definitions for 'prior opportunity', 'reasonable opportunity' and 'genuine attempt'. Specific points which often cause contention include: *How to interpret a 'reasonable opportunity' to dispose of the ball. For example, in a scenario with no prior opportunity, spectators would normally expect holding the ball to be paid if the player is still holding it after being swung around 360° in a tackle, but the umpire may elect not to do so if he feels a genuine attempt has been made to dispose of the ball or if the player breaks the tackle. *How to interpret a 'genuine attempt' to dispose of the ball. It is not uncommon for player seeking to force a stoppage and avoid a free kick to feign an attempt to handpass the ball by punching it with one hand while not actually releasing it with the other. It is at the umpire's discretion whether he deems this a genuine attempt or not. *How to interpret cases of dropping the ball. Unintentionally dropping the ball is legal under the various scenarios defined in Law 15.2.4(a-e), and illegal under all other circumstances, but the rules which distinguish these cases are detailed and complicated. Another point of contention among football observers regards how stringently the rule should be applied to make for an optimum spectacle. Applying the rule less strictly will tend to lead to congested play and an increase in the number of stoppages, because players who are tackled after having won the contested ball would rather hold it to force a neutral stoppage than kick the ball into a potential turnover. Applying the rule more strictly leads to a scenario which discourages players from trying to win the contested ball, as they find that it is more profitable to wait for an opponent to win the ball, then earn a free kick by tackling them; such a practice is considered to be against the spirit of the game as a contest. Changes to the rule throughout history have generally been brought about by moving undesirably close to one of these extremes, but many observers have differing opinions on which is the less desirable outcome and what the optimum interpretation would be. ==History== ===Early laws=== The holding the ball rule has its origins in Rule 8 of the Melbourne rules, the rule which placed limitations on a player's freedom to run with the ball. By the early 1870s, it had become common practice that a player running with the ball should drop it upon being held by an opponent; this was enshrined in the rules by 1876, with Rule 8 including the stipulation \\"in the event of a player with the ball in hand trying to pass an adversary, and being held by him, he must at once drop the ball,\\" with a free kick to be paid for a breach of the rule. Application of the law in the early years and throughout the first half of the 20th century would appear extremely stringent to a spectator familiar with the modern application of the rule. In general, the tackler needed to do little more than grip an opponent by the guernsey with one hand, not necessarily even retarding his progress, to earn a free kick. The full body tackle which would be seen in modern playing style was not necessary, and was very uncommonly seen because executing one would almost always result in conceding a holding the man free kick – that rule was also applied very stringently at the time, so a full body tackle would almost always linger for some time after the player had dropped the ball, and therefore would always be penalised. Until even the 1950s, full body tackling was thought of by the football-going public as a \\"rugby tackle\\": and while it was legal within the rules, it was so scarcely seen that many thought it to be illegal. ===Standardised laws=== One of the early difficulties encountered by the Australasian Football Council, which owned and administered the laws of the game from 1906 onwards, was in establishing a consistent interpretation the holding the ball rule between the different states. Sportswriters noted a particularly wide disparity between the interpretations of the rule in South Australia and Victoria: in South Australia, the rule was applied extremely stringently, with a defending player needing to do little more than touch a player running with the ball to force him to drop it, making it almost impossible for a player to run with the ball in the vicinity of opponents; but that in Victoria, a more significant hold or tackle was required to earn a free kick, resulting in players more willing to run through packs of opponents. These wide differences often led to difficulties in interstate matches. Particularly under the stricter interpretations of the rule, a problem emerged in that players were finding that standing back and allowing an opponent to win the ball before immediately tackling him to win a free kick was more profitable than attempting to win the ball and risking being tackled himself. This practice, known in those times as \\"malingering\\", was and still is considered undesirable, as it was believed that a rule which discouraged players from winning contested ball was against the spirit of the game. The banning of the flick pass in 1925, forcing players to use the more cumbersome punch pass, exacerbated this by making it more difficult to dispose of the ball. Several attempts were made during the 1920s to standardise and clarify the rules. In 1920, the Australasian Football Council amended its wording of the rule, replacing the word \\"caught\\" with \\"held\\" when describing the act of tackling, to attempt to make it clear that the defending player must do more than simply touch the ball-carrier to win a free kick. The rule was then rewritten entirely in 1928, when it was removed from the original Rule 8 (which by this time had been renumbered) and was added as a stand-alone rule. The new rule, intended to be less stringent, read: \\"A free kick shall be given against a player who, while being held by an opponent, and being in possession of the ball, does not at once kick, handball or drop it so as to relinquish possession of it. The free kick shall be given to the player who holds him. A player shall not be deemed to be held within the meaning of the foregoing paragraphs unless he is held firmly enough to stop him or to retard his progress.\\" ===No-drop holding the ball=== An undesirable style of close-in play had emerged by the 1930s: a player with the ball would be tackled, would drop the ball at his feet, wait for his opponent to release him, then bend down and regather the ball, with this sequence of events repeated over and over with both men trying to win a free kick – either for holding the ball or holding the man – rather than actively trying to move the football. These contests then attracted other players and formed scrimmages which slowed the game down. To eliminate this style of play, the concept of \\"no-drop holding the ball\\" was developed. This took away the provision for a player to drop the ball upon being tackled, and required him to dispose of the ball by kick or handpass; it was intended that the kick or handpass would clear the ball away from scrimmages around the tackled player. This change was a major change to the Laws of the Game, eliminating the sixty- year-old provision to drop the ball when tackled, but was a change which is fundamental to the modern interpretation of the rule. The Australian National Football Council first introduced no-drop holding the ball nationally prior to the 1930 season, although some small competitions had played under the rule earlier (the Victorian Junior Football Association, for example, introduced the rule in 1927). It was unpopular in the early months, and was blamed for an increase in congested play and an increase in injuries caused by players attempting wild kicks when previously they would have dropped the ball. Consequently, the change was hastily repealed after only two months. No-drop holding the ball was next introduced by the Victorian Football Association (VFA) in 1938. The VFA, which did not come under the National Council's influence, introduced the rule as part of a suite of novel rule changes, which also included the legalisation of throwing the ball as a type of handpass. The VFA's combination of the no-drop rule and throwing the ball had the immediate effect of reducing congestion, as it gave players the easy option to throw the ball into open space when tackled, instead of dropping the ball at their feet and causing a scrimmage to form around it. The National Council quickly followed the VFA's lead, re-instating the no-drop rule from the 1939 season, but it did not pair it with the throwing the ball rule. The no-drop rule again proved to be unpopular. Without the ability to execute a drop or a VFA-style throw, players were forced to rely on the more cumbersome disposal methods of a kick or a handpass; because umpires had conventionally called holding the ball penalties almost immediately when a player was tackled, it was very difficult (and sometimes impossible, depending upon the quickness of the presiding umpire) to execute either of these skills before conceding a free kick, and those who did manage to dispose of the ball often committed turnovers in doing so. Consequently, players favoured malingering over winning the contested ball more so than ever before. South Australian umpire Frank Armstrong commented that the no-drop rule became known as \\"the Bludger's Rule\\" among umpires during this time, since the rule so heavily favoured the tackler over the ball-winner. To rectify the problems, a more liberal interpretation of the rule was gradually adopted by the state leagues during the mid-1940s, then was formally codified into the Laws nationally in 1948. The new rules eliminated the requirement for the player to dispose of the ball \\"immediately\\", and replaced it with the stipulation \\"umpires must give the player who is in possession of the ball a reasonable chance of disposing of it before free kicking him,\\" first introducing the concept of a 'reasonable chance/opportunity' which remains enshrined in the modern Law 15.3.2 (b). Giving a reasonable chance, according to the VFL umpires' coaches in 1951, meant that a player who had bent down to pick up the ball would be given enough time to stand up and execute a disposal, or a player who collected the ball in full stride would be given time to balance himself. Additionally, the five definitions which are still enshrined in Laws 15.2.4 (a-e), outlining specific situations which are not considered to be holding the ball, were added to the Laws in 1948 (excluding the references to prior opportunity which were not added until the 1990s). These changes help to reduce malingering and provide incentive to win the hard ball; but, they introduced further points of discretion and sources of inconsistency to the umpire. ===Recent changes=== The wording of the holding the ball rule remained more or less unchanged for the next forty or fifty years, but the interpretation of the rule was adapted to suit changes to the game. As full body tackling became a fundamental part of the game, the interpretations of holding the ball (including what constituted a 'reasonable opportunity' to dispose of the ball) and holding the man were adjusted to suit. Adjustments made to the rules in the late 1970s created the definitions currently enshrined in Law 15.2.2, removing the ability for players to bounce the ball or handpass to themselves as ways to avoid holding the ball free kicks or win holding the man free kicks. footballer Kevin Bartlett was particularly well known for using these tactics to avoid being penalised for holding the ball, and the rule changes are generally associated with his play. The next and last major change to the holding the ball rule was the introduction of the 'prior opportunity' rule. The rule was initially introduced in 1986 and known as the \\"perfect tackle rule\\": tackling a player who had an opportunity to dispose of the ball before being tackled was defined as a perfect tackle, and the provision for a perfectly tackled player to have a reasonable time to dispose of the ball before being penalised was eliminated. The rule was introduced to speed up the game. This later became the modern 'prior opportunity' rule in 1996, and it was the first time that different holding the ball interpretations had been applied on the basis of what had taken place before the tackle was laid. Since then, only small adjustments have been made to the holding the ball rules. A rule under which a player was considered to have had prior opportunity immediately upon catching the ball on the full in a ruck contest was added to the Laws of the Game in 2003, and removed in 2019. The rule under which a player ducking and driving his head into an opponent is considered to have had a prior opportunity was introduced in 2015. ==See also== *Laws of Australian rules football *Holding the man ==References== Laws of Australian Football (Australian Football League) Spirit of the Laws (Australian Football League) Category:Australian rules football terminology Category:Laws of Australian rules football ","title":"Holding the ball"},{"id":"3234838","text":"The Norfolk and Portsmouth Belt Line Railroad is a class III railroad operating in southern Virginia.

The family fled Germany and eventually ended up in Amsterdam. They emigrated to America in 1939, where Hans became John. Most of his family back in Europe perished in the Holocaust. The Cahns settled in New York City. John Cahn became an American citizen in 1945. Serving in the United States Army, he was stationed in Japan during its occupation by the Allies. Cahn received a bachelor's degree in chemistry in 1949 from the University of Michigan. He later earned a Ph.D in physical chemistry in 1953 from the University of California at Berkeley. His doctoral thesis was titled \\"The Oxidation of Isotopically Labelled Hydrazine\\" and his thesis advisor was R. E. Powell. In 1954, Cahn joined the chemical metallurgy research effort at the General Electric laboratory in Schenectady, New York, led by David Turnbull. Turnbull had done pioneering work on the kinetics of nucleation, and there was a focus in the group on understanding the thermodynamics and kinetics of phase transformations in solids. In 1964, Cahn became a professor in the Department of Metallurgy (now Materials Science) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He left MIT in 1978. In 1969, Cahn began a long professional relationship with his graduate student, Francis Larché, whose work focussed on the effect of mechanical stress on the thermodynamics of solids. The Larche–Cahn approach is the cornerstone of the treatment of the thermodynamics of stressed materials. Good examples of this phenomenon are the regions near a coherent precipitate or the stress field around a dislocation. In 1972, Cahn worked with David W. Hoffman to formulate vector-based thermodynamics to describe the thermodynamics of interfaces, a formulation which is necessary to account for anisotropic materials. This is also known as the capillary vector formulation of interface energies. The mathematics of this treatment involves the concept of norms, although Cahn and Hoffman were unaware of it at the time. In 1975, Cahn worked with his graduate student Sam Allen on phase transitions in iron alloys, including order- disorder transitions. This work led to the Allen–Cahn equation. From 1984, he was an affiliate professor at the University of Washington. == Work == Microstructural evolution under the Cahn–Hilliard equation, demonstrating distinctive coarsening and phase separation. === The spinodal === In 1957, Cahn worked with John E. Hilliard to develop the Cahn–Hilliard equation which describes the thermodynamic forces driving phase separation in many systems, and developed the joint theory of spinodal decomposition.Cahn, J,W. and Hilliard, J.E., Free Energy of a Nonuniform System. I. Interfacial Free Energy, J. Chem. Phys., Vol. 28, p. 258 (1958)Cahn, J.W., Spinodal Decomposition, 1967 Institute of Metals Lecture, Trans. Met. Soc. ASME, Vol. 242, p. 168 (1968)Hilliard, J.E., Spinodal Decomposition, in Phase Transformations p. 497 (American Society of Metals, Metals Park, 1970)Cahn, J.W., On spinodal decomposition in cubic crystals, Acta Met., Vol. 10, p. 179 (1962) === Solidification === In the theory of crystal growth, Cahn concluded that the distinguishing feature is the ability of the surface to reach an equilibrium state in the presence of a thermodynamic driving force (typically in the form of the degree of undercooling). He also concluded that for every surface or interface in a crystalline medium, there exists a critical driving force, which, if exceeded, will enable the surface or interface to advance normal to itself, and, if not exceeded, will require the lateral growth mechanism. Thus, for sufficiently large driving forces, the interface can move uniformly without the benefit of either a heterogeneous nucleation or screw dislocation mechanism. What constitutes a sufficiently large driving force depends upon the diffuseness of the interface, so that for extremely diffuse interfaces, this critical driving force will be so small that any measurable driving force will exceed it. Alternatively, for sharp interfaces, the critical driving force will be very large, and most growth will occur by the lateral step mechanism. Hilliard, J.E. and Cahn, J.W., On the Nature of the Interface Between a Solid Metal and Its Melt, Acta Met., Vol. 6, p. 772 (1958)Cahn, J.W., Theory of crystal growth and interface motion in crystalline materials, Acta Met, Vol. 8, p. 554 (1960)Cahn, J.W., Coherent fluctuations and nucleation in isotropic solids, Acta Met., Vol. 10, p. 907 (1962)Cahn, J.W., Hillig, W.B., Sears, G.W., The molecular mechanism of solidification, Acta Met., Vol. 12, p. 1421 (1964) === Droplets and surfaces === In 1977, Cahn published a simple mathematical treatment of the thermodynamics of wetting: the interaction between a liquid in contact with a solid surface. This paper laid out a simple formulation for describing the wetting transition—the point at which a liquid changes from forming a droplet on a surface to spreading out evenly as a liquid film over the surface. This theory had wide-ranging implications for many materials processing techniques. === Quasicrystals === In 1982, Dan Shechtman observed a new crystalline structure with puzzling features. Cahn contributed to the theory of how such a structure could be thermodynamically stable and became co-author of the seminal paper which introduced quasicrystals. === Glass transition === In 2004, Cahn and Bendersky presented evidence that an \\"isotropic non-crystalline metallic phase\\" (dubbed \\"q-glass\\") can be grown from the melt. This is the \\"primary phase,\\" to form in the Al-Fe-Si system during rapid cooling. Experimental evidence indicates that this phase forms by a first-order transition. TEM images show that the q-glass nucleates from the melt as discrete particles, which grow spherically with a uniform growth rate in all directions. The diffraction pattern shows it to be an isotropic glassy phase. Yet there is a nucleation barrier, which implies an interfacial discontinuity (or internal surface) between the glass and the melt. == Research in retirement == In his retirement, Cahn accepted a position at the University of Washington as an affiliate professor in the Departments of Materials Science and Engineering and Physics. == Personal life == He had three children and six grandsons. In retirement, he lived in Seattle, Washington, with his wife, Anne Hessing Cahn. He died from leukemia in Seattle on March 14, 2016. == Honors and awards == 2011 The Kyoto Prize, Inamori Foundation 2002 Bower Prize, Franklin Institute 2001 Emil Heyn Medal, German Metallurgical Society 2001 Honorary Life Member, American Ceramic Society 1999 Bakhuys Roozeboon Lecturer and Gold medal, Netherlands Academy of Sciences 1998 National Medal of Science 1998 Member, National Academy of Engineering 1998 Distinguished GE Lecturer in Materials Science at RPI '69 & \`98 MacDonald Lecturer, Canadian Metallurgical Society 1996 Doctor Honoris Causis, Universite d'Évry, France 1995 Harvey Prize, Technion. 1994 Rockwell Medal; Hall of Fame for Engineering, Science and Technology, and Medal, International Technology Institute. 1994 Gold Medal, Honorary Member, Japan Institute of Metals. 1993 Inland Steel Lecture, Northwestern University. 1993 Hume–Rothery Award, TMS. 1993 Cyril Stanley Smith Lecturer, University of Chicago. 1992 Honorary member, MRS-India. 1991 Michelson–Morley Award, Case Western University.http://www.phys.cwru.edu/history/book%20pdfs/App%20D%20Events.pdf#page=3 1990 Honorary Sc.

Over 130 nations worldwide have adopted a regime providing for merger control. National or supernational competition agencies such as the EU European Commission or the US Federal Trade Commission are normally entrusted with the role of reviewing mergers. Merger control regimes are adopted to prevent anti-competitive consequences of concentrations (as mergers and acquisitions are also known). Accordingly, most merger control regimes normally provide for one of the following substantive tests: * Does the concentration significantly impede effective competition? (EU, Germany) * Does the concentration substantially lessen competition? (US, UK) * Does the concentration lead to the creation or strengthening of a dominant position? (Switzerland, Russia) In practice most merger control regimes are based on very similar underlying principles. In simple terms, the creation of a dominant position would usually result in a substantial lessening of or significant impediment to effective competition. The large majority of modern merger control regimes are of an ex-ante nature, i.e. the reviewing authorities carry out their assessment before the transaction is implemented. While it is indisputable that a concentration may lead to a reduction in output and result in higher prices and thus in a welfare loss to consumers, the antitrust authority faces the challenge of applying various economic theories and rules in a legally binding procedure. ==Horizontal mergers== The vast majority of significant competition issues associated with mergers arises in horizontal mergers.^ International Competition Network - Merger Guidelines Workbook, para. 1.6 http://www.internationalcompetitionnetwork.org/uploads/library/doc321.pdf A horizontal merger is one between parties that are competitors at the same level of production and/or distribution of a good or service, i.e., in the same relevant market.^ International Competition Network - Merger Guidelines Workbook, para. 3.4 http://www.internationalcompetitionnetwork.org/uploads/library/doc321.pdf There are two types of anticompetitive effects associated with horizontal mergers: unilateral effects and coordinated effects. Unilateral effects, also known as non-coordinated effects, arise where, as a result of the merger, competition between the products of the merging firms is eliminated, allowing the merged entity to unilaterally exercise market power, for instance by profitably raising the price of one or both merging parties’ products, thus harming consumers.International Competition Network - Merger Guidelines Workbook, para. 2.6 http://www.internationalcompetitionnetwork.org/uploads/library/doc321.pdf In homogeneous markets, unilateral effects can be pronounced when two significant competitors merge to create a large, dominant player with only a few or no other competitors. In these markets, an important role in the assessment is played by market shares and by the capacity available in the market.U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission Horizontal Merger Guidelines, para. 6.3 http://www.justice.gov/atr/public/guidelines/hmg-2010.html#6c In differentiated markets, unilateral effects tend to arise particularly when the two merging companies have highly substitutable goods. Such a price increase does not depend on the merged firm being the dominant player in the market. The likelihood and magnitude of such an increase will instead depend on the substitutability of the products supplied by the two firms – the closer the substitute, the greater the unilateral effects.European Commission - Horizontal Merger Guidelines, para. 28 http://eur- lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52004XC0205(02):EN:HTML Coordinated effects arise where, under certain market conditions (e.g., market transparency, product homogeneity etc.), the merger increases the probability that, post merger, merging parties and their competitors will successfully be able to coordinate their behaviour in an anti-competitive way, for example, by raising prices.International Competition Network - Merger Guidelines Workbook, para. 3.6 http://www.internationalcompetitionnetwork.org/uploads/library/doc321.pdf As in the case of unilateral effects, the most common form of coordinated effects is in the case of horizontal mergers, i.e. mergers between firms active on the same market. The main question in analysing coordinated effects should be whether the merger materially increases the likelihood that firms in the market will successfully coordinate their behaviour or strengthen existing coordination. The task is to identify what factors are likely to lead to coordination taking place between firms post-merger. This was a controversial area with which competition authorities and courts have struggled to come to terms over the years, but experience has led to the emergence of some agreement on what conditions are most likely to give rise to coordinated effects.International Competition Network - Merger Guidelines Workbook, paras. D.3 and D.4 http://www.internationalcompetitionnetwork.org/uploads/library/doc321.pdf Under the European Union merger control regime, in order for coordinated effects to arise the so-called \\"Airtours criteria\\" have to be fulfilled.From the judgment of the General Court of the European Union which introduced these criteria. See Case T-342/99, Airtours v Commission, [2002] ECR II-2585. According to the \\"Airtours criteria\\", coordination is more likely to emerge in markets where it is relatively simple to reach a common understanding on the terms of coordination. In addition, three conditions are necessary for coordination to be sustainable. First, the coordinating firms must be able to monitor to a sufficient degree whether the terms of coordination are being adhered to. Second, discipline requires that there is some form of credible deterrent mechanism that can be activated if deviation is detected. Third, the reactions of outsiders, such as current and future competitors not participating in the coordination, as well as customers, should not be able to jeopardise the results expected from the coordination.European Commission - Horizontal Merger Guidelines, para. 41 http://eur- lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52004XC0205(02):EN:HTML ==Non-horizontal mergers== There are two basic forms of non-horizontal mergers: vertical mergers and conglomerate mergers.^ International Competition Network - Merger Guidelines Workbook, para. 3.7 http://www.internationalcompetitionnetwork.org/uploads/library/doc321.pdf Vertical mergers are mergers between firms that operate at different but complementary levels in the chain of production (e.g., manufacturing and an upstream market for an input) and/or distribution (e.g., manufacturing and a downstream market for re-sale to retailers) of the same final product. In purely vertical mergers there is no direct loss in competition as in horizontal mergers because the parties' products did not compete in the same relevant market. As such, there is no change in the level of concentration in either relevant market. Vertical mergers have significant potential to create efficiencies largely because the upstream and downstream products or services complement each other. Even so, vertical integration may sometimes give rise to competition concerns.^ International Competition Network - Merger Guidelines Workbook, paras. 3.7 http://www.internationalcompetitionnetwork.org/uploads/library/doc321.pdf Vertical effects can produce competitive harm in the form of foreclosure. A merger is said to result in foreclosure where actual or potential rivals' access to supplies or markets is hampered or eliminated as a result of the merger, thereby reducing these companies' ability and/or incentive to compete.European Commission Non-Horizontal Merger Guidelines, para. 29 http://eur- lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2008:265:0006:01:EN:HTML Two forms of foreclosure can be distinguished. The first is where the merger is likely to raise the costs of downstream rivals by restricting their access to an important input (input foreclosure). The second is where the merger is likely to foreclose upstream rivals by restricting their access to a sufficient customer base (customer foreclosure).European Commission Non- Horizontal Merger Guidelines, para. 30 http://eur- lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2008:265:0006:01:EN:HTML In general, vertical merger concerns are likely to arise only if market power already exists in one or more markets along the supply chain.^ International Competition Network - Merger Guidelines Workbook, paras. 3.10 http://www.internationalcompetitionnetwork.org/uploads/library/doc321.pdf Conglomerate mergers involve firms that operate in different product markets, without a vertical relationship. They may be product extension mergers, i.e., mergers between firms that produce different but related products or pure conglomerate mergers, i.e., mergers between firms operating in entirely different markets. In practice, the focus is on mergers between companies that are active in related or neighbouring markets, e.g., mergers involving suppliers of complementary products or of products belonging to a range of products that is generally sold to the same set of customers in a manner that lessens competition.^ International Competition Network - Merger Guidelines Workbook, para. 3.12 http://www.internationalcompetitionnetwork.org/uploads/library/doc321.pdf Merger review in this area is controversial, as commentators and enforcement agencies disagree on the extent to which one can predict competitive harm resulting from such mergers.^ International Competition Network - Merger Guidelines Workbook, para. 3.13 http://www.internationalcompetitionnetwork.org/uploads/library/doc321.pdf Such a disagreement is for instance illustrated by the different outcomes of the merger control reviews by the authorities of the United States and the European Union of the GE/Honeywell merger attempt. Proponents of conglomerate theories of harm argue that in a small number of cases, where the parties to the merger have strong market positions in their respective markets, potential harm may arise when the merging group is likely to foreclose other rivals from the market in a way similar to vertical mergers, particularly by means of tying and bundling their products. When as a result of foreclosure rival companies become less effective competitors, consumer harm may result. However, it should be stressed that in these cases there is a real risk of foregoing efficiency gains that benefits consumer welfare and thus the theory of competitive harm needs to be supported by substantial evidence.^ International Competition Network - Merger Guidelines Workbook, para. 3.14-3.15 http://www.internationalcompetitionnetwork.org/uploads/library/doc321.pdf ==Mandatory and voluntary regimes== A merger control regime is described as \\"mandatory\\" when filing of a transaction is compulsory. Mandatory regimes normally also contain a so-called \\"suspensory clause\\", which implies that the parties to a transaction are indefinitely prevented from closing the deal until they have received merger clearance. The majority of merger jurisdictions worldwide have mandatory merger control systems. An examples of a mandatory system with suspensory clause is provided by the European Union merger control.See Regulation of the Council (EC) No. 139/2004 on the control of concentrations between undertakings (the EU Merger Regulation) http://eur- lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32004R0139:EN:HTML A distinction can also be made between \\"local\\" and \\"global\\" bars on closing/implementation; some mandatory regimes provide that the transaction cannot be implemented within the particular jurisdiction (local bar on closing) and some provide that the transaction cannot be closed/implemented anywhere in the world prior to merger clearance (global bar on closing). A number of jurisdictions worldwide have a merger control regime which imposes a global bar on closing. This creates obstacles for the parties to a concentration to close a transaction until a number of the regulatory clearances required are obtained. A merger control regime is described as \\"voluntary\\" when the parties are not prevented from closing the deal and implementing the transaction in advance of having applied for and received merger clearance. In these circumstances the merging parties are effectively taking the risk that the competition authority will not require them to undo the deal if in due course it is found that the transaction is likely to have an anti-competitive effect. Voluntary regimes are fairly exceptional. The United Kingdom, for instance, has a voluntary merger control regime. However, the Office of Fair Trading can request the parties to a merger that has already completed to hold the two businesses separate pending an investigation (so called \\"initial undertakings\\"). Mandatory regimes can be considered effective in preventing anticompetitive concentrations since it is almost impossible to unravel a merger once it has been implemented (for example because key staff have been made redundant, assets have been sold and information has been exchanged). On the other hand, voluntary regimes are seen as constituting less of a burden for merging firms. == See also == *Regulatory economics *EU Horizontal Merger Guidelines *US Horizontal Merger Guidelines *Competition Law *SSNIP ==References== ==External links== *Global Competition Forum *International Competition Network *OECD Competition/Antitrust Policy Division *Institute of Mergers, Acquisitions and Alliances (MANDA) M&A; An academic research institute on mergers & acquisitions, incl. anti trust issues *The European Commission Directorate General for Competition enforces merger control in the European Economic Area * The Competition Commission controls and regulates mergers in the UK Category:Mergers and acquisitions Category:Competition law fr:Droit français de la concurrence#Contrôle des concentrations nl:Nederlandse Mededingingsautoriteit#Toetsing van concentraties ","title":"Merger control"},{"id":"3234883","text":"Live At The Annandale is The Bronx's first available DVD, it showcases a full concert that was held at the Annandale Hotel in Sydney, Australia and released not long after the concert.

It is adapted for USDA hardiness zones of 4 to 8. ==Description== It is a shrub growing to tall. The leaves are in opposite pairs, long and broad, three- to five-lobed, the lobes with a serrated margin, and the leaf surface has a fuzzy texture. There is a diverse manifestation of autumn color with this species from pale yellow to bright yellow to orange or pink, rose, or red-purple depending on the light exposure and weather conditions. The flowers are white with five small petals, produced in terminal cymes diameter. The fruit is a small red to purple-black drupe 4–8 mm (about 1/3\\") long. It attracts butterflies and birds. Viburnum acerifolium is a larval host to the Celastrina ladon butterfly. It grows in and around upland forest, able to do well in full shade and dry soils. It grows mostly in acid soil of pH 5.0 to 6.5, but can tolerate up to 7.5. The shrub often ground suckers some and can form a colony in time. ==Distribution== Viburnum acerifolium is found in such US states as Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island New York and Vermont as well as Illinois, Wisconsin, Florida, Arkansas and Texas. ==Habitat== Landscape architects and designers have often recommended it for shady, dry locations for several decades, but it is only sold at a few very large, diverse nurseries or specialty or native plant nurseries and is not generally well known in the trade or with homeowners. ==Ecology== The species' flowers are known for production of nectar and pollen which are then carried by the bee species from Andrenidae and Halictidae families as well as flies from the Empididae and Syrphidae families. The flowers also attract beetles, wasps and various butterflies (including skippers). The berries are gobbled down by various mammals including skunks, rabbits, deer, the eastern chipmunk, white-footed mouse and deer mice. C. acerifolium also attracts various aphids, such as Viburnum leaf beetle, the wood-boring larvae of Oberea deficiens and Oberea tripunctata. The scientific and common names refer to the superficial similarity of the leaves to those of some maples (Acer); the plant is occasionally mistaken for young maples, but is readily distinguished by the flowers and fruit; the viburnum produces small, purple berries, while maples produce dry, winged seeds.

Some of her other memorable movies were “Bilwamangal”, “Shakuntala”, “Alibaba aur Chalis Chor”, “Aankh ka Nasha”, “Zehari Saanp”, etc. By mid 1936 her relation with seth Karnani owner of Madan theatre deteriorated and she left Madan theatres and she had to face a legal case by Karnani which ruined her she had to sold her mansion in Calcutta and all of her property so she left calcutta in early 1938 and Made her own Thaetrical company Jahanara theatrical company and decided to present her famous old shows with less duration and some new settings, she spent 60,000 rupees in those days on a stage project and started doing shows in all over India started from lahore, Amritsar, multan, Delhi and Bombay but her health started to fall so she along with her Mother Suggan bai had to settle in Bombay and started working in bombay film Industry Kajjan's career in Bombay was short-lived from 1941 to 1944, during which she appeared in seven filmsmostly of Ranjit films, sunrise pictures and Minerva films none of them ade big for Kajjan with the exception of Sohrab Modi's “Prithvi Vallabh” in which she was given a character role Further, she was given character roles so she could not made it big in Bombay. Her films in Bombay were Ghar Sansar, Suhagan, Bharuthari, Prarthna, Merchant of Venice and her last was Ranjit films Mumtaz Mahal in which she played Empress Noor Jahan. She lived a lavish life at Calcutta. She even had two tiger cubs as pets. Kajjan had learnt western dancing and was a regular visitor to Calcutta Club, it is said that she was intimately involved with Najmul Hassan, a popular Star in 1930s. She died of Cancer in late December 1945 at a young age of 30. Starting her career from stage, she moved to films, joining J. J. Madan's Madan Theatres. Two of her early Talkies becoming instant hits, Shirin Farhad (1931) and Laila Majnu (1931) both Madan Theatre productions. Her co-star in the two films was Master Nissar and the duo became popular singing sensations, with Kajjan being known as \\"the lark of India\\". Her mother was a \\"tawaif\\" with important connections. Jehanara was educated at home, where she learned English and Urdu; she wrote poetry, some of which was published. She received a classical music training from Ustad Hussain Khan. She began appearing on stage in the years when women were first allowed to perform in the Indian theatre. Aside from acting, she and Ghulam Mohammed also taught Noor Jehan when the latter was young, making her do riyaz up to 12 hours each day.PTV World News Kajjan stopped singing in 1930, however, she continued to star in movies such as Shirin Farhad and Layla Majnun opposite Nissar, becoming a symbol of on-screen romance in the cinema of India. ==Notable films== Shirin Farhad (1931), the second Indian Talkie to be made, was released two months after the landmark Alam Ara, which released on 11 March 1931. The story centred on a folk-legend from the Shahnama, and was already a success on the Parsi stage. J. J. Madan adapted it to film form with Master Nissar and Kajjan playing the lead roles. According to author Gooptu, the film \\"created a box- office record\\". It was \\"twice as successful\\" compared to Alam Ara, and had 17 (out of the 18) songs sung by Jehanara Kajjan and Master Nisaar. *Laila Majnu (1931) *Indrasabha (1932) *Bilwamangal (1933) *Sakhi Lutera (1934) *Zehri Saanp (1934) *Shaitan Ka Pash (1935) *Rasheeda (1935) *Manorma (1936) *Regeneration (1936) *Mera Pyara (1936) ==Death== Kajjan died in 1945 in Bombay, Maharashtra, India. ==Songs== *Kahe neha lagaye sajania *tumhare darshan ko naina *Ek dhundla sa mohabat ka hai naqsha *Aya sawan aja sajan *Kookat koyalia ==Films== *Shirin Farhad (1931) *Laila Majnu (1931) *Zalim Saudagar (1941) *Prarthana (1943) *Prithvi Vallabh (1943) ==References== ==Sources== * * ==External links== * Indian Cinema Database at the University of Pennsylvania.

Max Matern was a communist who was convicted of first degree murder and executed for his role in the assassinations of Police Captains Paul Anlauf and Franz Lenck. The murders took place in 1931 at Bülow-Platz in Berlin. Mayern was later glorified as a martyr by the KPD and East Germany's Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED). ==Early life== Max Matern was born in Berndshof near Ueckermünde and grew up in meager circumstances in Quitzdorf am See in eastern Saxony. He did an apprenticeship as a moulder in Torgelow and in 1925 moved to Berlin owing to the lack of jobs closer to home. There he found work as a member of the KPD's Parteiselbstschutz (Party Self Defense Unit) in which he demonstrated hard-line conviction and loyalty to the party. Communist leaders Ernst Thälmann (left) and Willy Leow (right) in front of parading troops of Rotfrontkämpferbund during their national meeting in Berlin, June 1927. According to John Koehler, > Like their Nazi counterparts, the Selbstschutz men were thugs who served as > bouncers at Party meetings and specialized in cracking heads during street > battles with political enemies. Besides the Nazis, their arch foes included > the Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands (SPD) -- the Social Democratic > Party of Germany -- and radical nationalist parties. They always carried a > Stahlrute, two steel springs that telescoped into a tube seven inches long, > which when extended became a deadly, fourteen inch weapon. Not to be outdone > by the Nazis, these goons often were armed with pistols as well.The Stasi, > p. 38. ==The Murders== During the last days of the Weimar Republic, the KPD in Berlin had a policy of assassinating a Berlin police officer in retaliation for every KPD member killed by the police. On August 2, 1931, KPD Members of the Reichstag Heinz Neumann and Hans Kippenberger received a dressing down from Walter Ulbricht, the Party's leader in the Berlin-Brandenburg region. Enraged by police interference and by Neumann and Kippenberger's failure to follow the policy, Ulbricht snarled, \\"At home in Saxony we would have done something about the police a long time ago. Here in Berlin we will not fool around much longer. Soon we will hit the police in the head.\\"The Stasi, p. 36. Enraged by Ulrbicht's words, Kippenberger and Neumann decided to assassinate Captain Paul Anlauf, the forty-two-year-old commander of the Seventh Precinct. Captain Anlauf, a widower with three daughters, had been nicknamed Schweinebacke, or \\"Pig Face\\" by the KPD. According to John Koehler, > Of all the policemen in strife-torn Berlin, the reds hated Anlauf the most. > His precinct included the area around KPD headquarters, which made it the > most dangerous in the city. The captain almost always led the riot squads > that broke up illegal rallies of the Communist Party.The Stasi, p. 36. On the morning of Sunday August 9, 1931, Kippenberger and Neumann gave a last briefing to the hit-team in a room at the Lassant beer hall. Erich Mielke and Erich Ziemer were selected as the shooters. During the meeting, Matern gave a Luger pistol to a fellow lookout and said, \\"Now we're getting serious... We're going to give Schweinebacke something to remember us by.\\"The Stasi, pp. 38-39. The funeral of Paul Anlauf and Franz Lenck was attended by thousands of Berliners Kippenberger then asked Mielke and Ziemer, \\"Are you sure that you are ready to shoot Schweinebacke?\\"The Stasi, p. 39. Mielke responded that he had seen Captain Anlauf many times during police searches of Party Headquarters. Kippenberger then instructed them to wait at a nearby beer hall which would permit them to overlook the entire Bülow-Platz. He further reminded them that Captain Anlauf was accompanied everywhere by Senior Sergeant Max Willig, who the KPD had nicknamed, \\"Hussar.\\" Kippenberger concluded, \\"When you spot Schweinebacke and Hussar, you take care of them.\\"The Stasi, p. 39. After the assassinations were completed, Mielke and Ziemer were informed that a diversion would assist in their escape. They were then to return to their homes and await further instructions. That evening, Captain Anlauf was lured to Bülow-Platz by a violent rally demanding the dissolution of the Prussian Parliament. According to John Koehler, > As was often the case when it came to battling the dominant SPD, the KPD and > the Nazis had combined forces during the pre-plebiscite campaign. At one > point in this particular campaign, Nazi propaganda chief Joseph Goebbels > even shared a speaker's platform with KPD agitator Walter Ulbricht. Both > parties wanted the parliament dissolved because they were hoping that new > elections would oust the SPD, the sworn enemy of all radicals. That fact > explained why the atmosphere was particularly volatile this Sunday.The > Stasi, pp. 39-40. At eight o'clock that evening, Mielke and Ziemer, spotted Captain Anlauf, Sergeant Willig, and Captain Franz Lenck walking in front of the Babylon Cinema, which was located at the corner of Bülowplatz and Kaiser-Wilhelm- Straße. As they reached the door of the movie house, the policemen heard someone scream, \\"Schweinebacke!\\"The Stasi, p. 41. As Captain Anlauf turned towards the sound, Mielke and Ziemer opened fire at point blank range. Sergeant Willig was wounded in the left arm and the stomach. However, he managed to draw his Luger and fired a full clip at the assailants. Captain Franz Lenck was shot in the chest and fell dead in front of the entrance. Willig crawled over to Captain Anlauf, who had taken two bullets in the neck. As his life drained away, the Captain gasped, \\"Wiedersehen... Gruss...\\" (\\"So Long... Goodbye...\\")The Stasi, p. 41. Meanwhile, Matern, Mielke, Thunert, and Ziemer made their escape. After it was revealed that Sergeant Willig had survived and could identify the assailants, Mielke and Ziemer were smuggled to the Soviet Union. ==Arrest, trial, and execution== In March 1933, lookout Max Thunert was arrested by the Berlin police, he confessed to his involvement in the murders and revealed all he knew. Within days, fifteen suspects, including Matern, were rounded up and imprisoned. On 14 September 1933, Berlin's newspapers announced that all had confessed their role in the assassinations. Together with two co-defendants, Michael Klause and Friedrich Broede, Max Matern was convicted of murder on 19 June 1934 and sentenced to receive the death penalty. He was beheaded by the executioner's axe on 22 May 1935. ==Aftermath== In East German historical literature, Matern was made into a martyr for the Communist cause. Many streets, schools, and establishments were named after him. His life became the stylized career of an exemplary Communist, as seen in the propagandistic version of his biography below. Decades later, on 26 October 1993, Erich Mielke (1907–2000), former East German Minister of State Security, was convicted of murdering Captains Anlauf and Lenck in addition to the attempted murder of Sergeant Max Willig. He was sentenced to six years in prison. However, owing to health reasons, he did not serve the full sentence. ==Max Matern's biography according to East German history texts== Max Matern's father worked at the brickyard owned by Quitzdorf's great landowner family, and his mother worked in their fields. His parents' scanty livelihood was hardly enough to feed and clothe Max and his three siblings. So, the children had to help clean out the estate's stables after school. In 1916, Max Matern began an apprenticeship as a moulder in the Haller Works in Torgelow. The owner and the master treated the boys as cheap labour. Max Matern defied the goading and bullying and demanded fixed working times and wages for all apprentices. In talks with older colleagues, he showed an interest in political topics. Willi Pahl, one of his friends, remembers that time: :\\"We discussed the events in Russia in the circle of boys and wounded soldiers who had been sent home. Although we did not yet realize the October Revolution's historic consequences, we were reaching the opinion that one would have to go a similar way for there to be peace in our country.\\" === 1920 to 1922 === In the morning hours of 13 March 1920 began the Kapp Putsch. Heavy fighting developed in Mecklenburg, for on the landowners' estates, weapons had been deposited and battle units formed. On 16 March, four hundred or so workers armed themselves and delivered themselves to Jatznick railway station with the members of the National Union. There was heavy fighting. When in June 1922, several thousand members of monarchist warrior associations came together in Eggesin in honour of General Field Marshal August von Mackensen, Max Matern and his brothers also went there to attack those gathered there with fists and clubs, and to chase them off. === 1925 to 1930 === Inflation and his joblessness caused Max Matern to make his way to Berlin early in 1925. He had the hope of beginning a somewhat better life there. In the Kailing & Thomas Iron Foundry in Wedding he found a job. On Burgstraße he moved into a furnished room. Among the communist workers he quickly won friends and in December 1925, he became their comrade. Max Matern began to devote himself to political work, studied the \\"Elementary Books of Communism\\", the Communist Manifesto, and further writings published by the Party. He joined the \\"Universum-Bücherei\\" socialist book club and read among other books the authors Émile Zola, Henri Barbusse and Maxim Gorki. He informed himself about his political work through articles in the KPD's military-political magazine \\"Oktober\\" and in the \\"Rote Fahne\\" (\\"Red Flag\\"). He got involved in the Party's operational cell and in the trade union, even becoming street cell organizational leader in Wedding. In 1930, Max Matern became a member of the KPD's Protection and Security Service. There he kept watch on Karl Liebknecht House, and went on patrol to observe the National Socialists and duly identify their offences. But the Party also used him as a bodyguard for Party Chairman Ernst Thälmann, and for Clara Zetkin, and further Central Committee members. === 1932 to 1933 === In the summer of 1932, the National Socialists with their Sturmabteilung went forth against the communist workers in early June. In June, 17 workers died, in July 86. In Berlin the SA teams' attacks were increasingly being aimed at Karl Liebknecht House. There the KPD Central Committee had an office. The building's defenders could in fact only put up a fight with clubs and a stream of water from a hydrant, but they successfully warded the attacking SA men off, and thereby thwarted any storming of the building. Among the defenders was also Max Matern. In January 1933, Wilhelm Pieck and the Secretary General of the Communist Party of France, Maurice Thorez spoke at the graves of the communist fallen in Friedrichsfelde. Max Matern helped the foreign guest and his group evade police capture. On 25 March 1933, Matern was arrested and brought before a court. In the \\"Bülow- Platz Trial\\" which was about the murder of two policemen in 1931, he was accused of involvement. On 19 June 1933, Max Matern and two other accused were sentenced to death, and seven co-accused were sentenced to lengthy prison terms. He lived for two years in a solitary confinement cell. On 22 May 1935, Max Matern was executed with an axe. ==References== ==Further reading== *John Koehler, The Stasi: The Untold Story of the East German Secret Police, (1999).

The \\"republic\\" never claimed to be a state as such, but was a base for the republican civil war aim of creating an all- Ireland Irish Republic. After the first week of fighting in the Civil War (28 June - 5 July 1922), Dublin was held by those in support of the Anglo-Irish Treaty and the Irish Free State. The main stronghold of Anti-Treaty forces (the Irish Republicans) became the self-styled Munster Republic, consisting of the counties south of a line between Limerick and Waterford. Liam Lynch, the republican commander-in-chief, hoped to use the \\"Republic\\" as a means of re- negotiating the Treaty, and ideally reconstituting the Irish Republic of 1919–21. For this defensive attitude, Lynch was bitterly criticised by some other republicans, who felt that he should be acting offensively to bring the war to a quick end. However, the Anti-Treaty side (who were supported by a large group of rebels from the Irish Republican Army), lacked artillery and armoured cars, both of which the Free State had to borrow from the British. The Free State launched an offensive against the Munster Republic in July 1922. Limerick and Waterford were taken easily, and Cork became the last county independent of the Free State. Michael Collins sent the Free State Army by sea to Union Hall in County Cork and to Fenit in County Kerry. Cork was retaken on 10 August. His opponents then moved into the countryside and continued small-scale guerrilla warfare until April 1923. ==References== * Category:Irish Civil War Category:Munster Category:Former countries in Ireland Category:1922 in Ireland ","title":"Munster Republic"},{"id":"3235004","text":"Laser Invasion, released as in Japan, is a multi-genre first-person action game released by Konami for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1991. The player takes control of a military operative who pilots an attack helicopter in order to infiltrate various enemy bases and fulfill his mission. The game supports the standard NES controller, as well as the NES Zapper light gun and the LaserScope, a voice-activated headset controller Konami released for the NES that was compatible with all light gun games released for the system. The American version of the game featured a rebate for the LaserScope in the instruction booklet. ==Plot== A hostile nation is secretly planning to launch a new type of weapon against its enemies. As a member of a special armed force, the player's objective is to prevent the enemy from launching their weapon. The player's initial objective is to rescue a covert agent codenamed Spider, who has been captured in one of the enemy's bases. ==Gameplay== The game is composed of four missions with three different playing styles. The first is to come to the enemy area with an upgraded AH-64 Apache. Before each mission begins, the player will receive a mission briefing from their commanding officer, who will explain the player's next mission objective. In all of the game's missions (with the exception of Mission 3, which takes place entirely in the air), the player must land their helicopter into enemy heliports and then infiltrate the enemy bases in order to fulfill a certain objective. After fulfilling their mission, the player must escape from the enemy's base. The player can adjust the game's sounds, controls, and their number of lives in the option menu before starting the game. The game's gun shooting segments can be played with the Zapper or the LaserScope. When the player loses all of their lives, they will be given five chances to continue where they left off. The player can also gain extra lives by reaching certain scores. ===Helicopter mode=== The player begins each mission piloting a combat helicopter before landing on a heliport and infiltrating the enemy base on foot. Each mission begins with the player being asked to choose what kind of missiles to equip their helicopter with. The player can choose between 40 small missiles, 20 medium missiles, and 10 large missiles (giving the player a choice between greater quantity, greater firepower, or a balance between both). The player will then choose what kind of optional equipment to add to their helicopter (extra fuel, chaff grenades, or ground missiles). After its equipment has been chosen, the player's helicopter will them take off from its home base and fly into the enemy's airspace. The player controls the helicopter from the pilot's perspective, with the top portion of the screen showing the player's current flightpath, as well as a gun sight for their helicopter's vulcan cannon and missiles. The bottom of the screen shows the helicopter's cockpit, which displays the player's fuel, damage condition, speed, missiles, equipment, and two kinds of radars. One of them is a Wide Area Radar which shows the overall area, displaying the player's current position, as well as the position of enemy and allied heliports and special targets. The other is an Immediate Range Radar which shows the proximity of nearby enemies. If enemies are approaching from behind, a danger lamp will turn on to warm the player. The player's primary weapon is a vulcan cannon with unlimited ammunition. The player can switch between its missiles or its optional equipment and then use them during the middle of combat. By default, the helicopter will fly in top speed towards the player's current flightpath. In order to land into a heliport, the player must reduce their helicopter's speed until it stops completely and the helicopter is only hovering. The player must then try to align their sight into the heliport's landing spot and descend their copter as best as they can while managing with their current wind condition. If the player fails to land their copter correctly, they must try again. If the player lands into an allied heliport, their helicopter will be repaired and refuel and the player will be allowed to change their equipment. The player will lose a life if their damage indicator or fuel runs out or if their helicopter is struck by an enemy missile. The player can use the chaff grenades to become invulnerable to enemy missiles for a limited period. ===Gun shooting mode=== When the player lands into an enemy heliport, their character will dismount from his helicopter and proceed to enter the perimeter of the enemy's base. The action in this segments are more straightforward, as the screen scrolls automatically to the right while several kinds of enemy soldiers attack the player. The player must attack all enemy soldiers who appear by shooting them with their handgun as they would in any other light gun shooting game. The bottom of the screen indicates the player's remaining health, as well as their remaining ammunition, both which can be replenished by picking up power-up items hidden inside weapon crates. The player can also shoot at certain oil drums to kill all on-screen enemies at once. These segments end when the player reaches the entrance of the base. ===Maze mode=== When the player completes a Gun-shooting segment, the game switches playing style again, this time to a first-person exploration mode. In this mode, the player must navigate their character throughout the interior corridor of an enemy base to obtain vital items, including additional ammunition and health-restoring rations, while avoiding traps. Sometimes, the player will encounter their ally Spider, who will offer player information on how to complete their objective. When the player encounters enemy soldiers in these, it switches to a gun-shooting mode similar to the gun-shooting segments until all enemies are defeated. After the player has gotten what they needed to complete their mission, they must leave the base from where they began. The bottom part of the screen displays the player's map (which shows the areas that have been explored and the player's current position), their remaining health and ammo, and all the items they have collected. ==Regional differences== The Japanese Family Computer version, Gun Sight, includes a password feature that allows the player to begin at later missions. In contrast, the American NES version increased the number of continues from three to five and allows the player to adjust the starting number of lives from the default three to five. The Japanese version did not include support for the LaserScope, only allowing the player to use the standard controller or the Famicom's light gun. ==References== Category:1991 video games Category:Konami games Category:Light gun games Category:Nintendo Entertainment System games Category:Nintendo Entertainment System-only games Category:Rail shooters Category:Video games developed in Japan ","title":"Laser Invasion"},{"id":"3235026","text":"Barrikadnaya () is a station on the Tagansko-Krasnopresnenskaya Line of the Moscow Metro. It is named after the events of the Revolution of 1905 when it was a site for barricades on Krasnaya Presnya street. The station was opened in 1972 as the first station on the Krasnopresenenskiy line, and for three years was its southern terminus, until the tunnel to Pushkinskaya connected it to the Zhdanovskiy line. The station was built following a typical pylon design, however due to unfavourable underlying geological conditions the pylons eventually had to be widened. Decoratively the station shows that by the early 1970s the architectural style of Moscow Metro stations had evolved from the functional designs of the 1960s. The station architects Strelkov and Polikarpova applied a theme of pink and red marble to the pylons, which due to their extension from the floor to the vault appear to look like barricades. The walls are exquisitely decorated with different shades of pink, red, blue and grey marble. The central hall had to be extended as the station was initially designed for extended seven-carriage trains (although the line has been using eight-carriages since the late 1980s). This design is most obviously seen in the entrances to the central hall, which are all decorated with metallic artworks. The entrance to the station is located on Barrikadnaya Street, which links Krasnaya Presnya with the Garden Ring, and is externally decorated with stone artwork depicting the events of 1905. Across the road is one of Stalin's Seven Sisters skyscrapers. From the opposite end of the central hall there is a transfer to the Krasnopresnenskaya station of the Koltsevaya Line The daily passenger traffic of the station amounts to 32,400 people via the station entrance, and 118,500 using the transfer. ==External links== *mymetro.ru *KartaMetro.info -- Station location and exits on Moscow map (English/Russian) Category:Moscow Metro stations Category:Railway stations in Russia opened in 1972 Category:Tagansko-Krasnopresnenskaya Line Category:Railway stations located underground in Russia ","title":"Barrikadnaya"},{"id":"3235035","text":"Spotlight is the name given to a BBC Northern Ireland weekly current affairs programme.

On foggy nights, the lasers that are used to focus the mirrors can be seen. IACT stands for Imaging Atmospheric (or Air) Cherenkov Telescope or Technique. It is a device or method to detect very-high-energy gamma ray photons in the photon energy range of 50 GeV to 50 TeV. There are four operating IACT systems: High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.), Major Atmospheric Gamma Imaging Cherenkov Telescopes (MAGIC), First G-APD Cherenkov Telescope (FACT), and Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS). Set to be the world's largest telescope at the highest altitude, the Major Atmospheric Cherenkov Experiment Telescope (MACE) is built at Hanle, Ladakh, India. Also under design is the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA). ==Background== Due to the rapidly falling flux of gamma-ray photons from cosmic sources in this energy regime, space-based detectors become ineffective due to their small collection areas which are often limited to some tens or hundreds of square centimeters. In the case of the IACT, the Earth's atmosphere is used as the detection medium, implying a collection area of many hundreds of square meters. This enables IACT instruments to detect gamma-ray photons in an energy regime inaccessible to space-based instruments. ==Technique== The IACT works by imaging the very short flash of Cherenkov radiation generated by the cascade of relativistic charged particles produced when a very-high-energy gamma ray strikes the atmosphere. This shower of charged particles, known as an Extensive Air Shower (EAS), is initiated at an altitude of 10–20 km. The incoming gamma-ray photon undergoes pair production in the vicinity of the nucleus of an atmospheric molecule. The electron- positron pair produced are of extremely high energy and immediately undergo Bremsstrahlung or \\"Braking Radiation\\". This radiation produced is itself extremely energetic, with many of the photons undergoing further pair production. A cascade of charged particles ensues which, due to its extreme energy, produces a flash of Cherenkov radiation lasting between 5 and 20 ns. The total area on the ground illuminated by this flash corresponds to many hundreds of square meters, which is why the effective area of IACT telescopes is so large. The instrument used to detect the Cherenkov radiation usually comprises a large segmented mirror which reflects the Cherenkov light onto an array of photomultiplier tubes. The tubes are coupled to fast electronics which amplify, digitise and record the pattern or image of the shower. The most effective mode of operation is to use an array of such telescopes, which can be typically located 70 to 120 meters apart. The primary advantage of this mode of operation is that the energy threshold (the peak sensitivity) of the telescope can be lowered as local muons produced by cosmic ray induced showers can be eliminated. This is because the narrow Cherenkov light cone produced by local muons will only be recorded by a single telescope. The shower reconstruction and background rejection offered by an array of telescopes provides an order of magnitude increase in sensitivity and improved angular and energy resolution as compared to a single telescope. This advantage has been used to great effect by the H.E.S.S. telescope array which has detected several new sources of very high energy gamma-ray photons in recent years. ==History== The IACT was pioneered by the Whipple collaboration and led to the discovery of TeV emission from the Crab Nebula in 1989. The Whipple 10m telescope also discovered the first extra-galactic source of TeV emission with the detection of very-high-energy gamma-ray emission from the active galaxy Markarian 421. The HEGRA telescope array was the first system to use multiple telescopes, a technique known as stereoscopy. The MAGIC system at the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory in La Palma began with one 17 m telescope in 2004, to which a second 17 m telescope was added in 2009. The H.E.S.S. collaboration has added to their system in Namibia a new 28 m IACT, currently the largest IACT telescope, which has been operational since July 2012. ==See also== *List of telescope types *Cherenkov Telescope Array *VERITAS *MAGIC (telescope) *High Energy Stereoscopic System ==References== ==External links== *Aspera European network portal *Astroparticle physics news on Twitter *Official web page of CTA *NASA Goddard Space Flight Center - Air Cerenkov Detectors Category:Observational astronomy Category:Gamma-ray astronomy ","title":"IACT"},{"id":"3235042","text":"Sughd Region () is one of the four administrative divisions and one of the three regions () that make up Tajikistan.

Produced by Ridley Scott (who had been working on an adaptation since the mid-1970s) and Tony Scott, the film stars James Franco and Sophia Myles, alongside a supporting cast featuring Rufus Sewell, Mark Strong, and Henry Cavill. This was Franchise Pictures' last film before bankruptcy. ==Plot== The film is set in Britain and Ireland in the Dark Ages, after the fall of the Roman Empire. Lord Marke of Cornwall plans to unify the people of Britain – Celts, Picts, Angles, Saxons, and Jutes – under himself as high king to resist Irish domination. The Irish king, Donachadh, discovers this and sends troops to attack Tantallon Castle where a treaty between the British tribes is being discussed. The raid claims the lives of the castle's lord and his wife, but Marke manages to save their young son, Tristan, at the cost of losing a hand. Feeling compassion for the boy, whose father loyally supported him, Marke welcomes Tristan into his home and regards him as a son. Nine years later, Tristan has grown into a fierce, courageous warrior whose loyalty to Marke is that of a son to his father. Tristan and other Cornish warriors launch an attack on an Irish slave caravan. Tristan fights Morholt, the leader of the army, his father's killer and the man Donachadh's daughter, Princess Isolde, has been promised in marriage to. Though Tristan kills Morholt and Donachadh's forces are overrun, he is severely wounded in the fight and believed dead, though he is in fact only suffering the effects of Morholt's poisoned sword. Tristan's body is put out to sea on a funeral boat which eventually washes up along the shores of Ireland. He is discovered by Isolde and her maid, Bragnae, who administer an antidote that revives him. Bragnae insists that Isolde conceal her identity so Isolde tells Tristan her name is Bragnae and that she is a lady-in-waiting. Tristan and Isolde fall in love as she nurses him back to health. The two lovers must separate after Tristan's boat is discovered. Tristan returns to Cornwall and receives a hero's welcome. An overjoyed Marke welcomes him back with open arms. Plotting to defeat Britain, Donachadh proposes a peace treaty, promising Isolde in marriage to the winner of a tournament. Tristan wins the tournament on behalf of Marke, unaware that \\"the prize\\" is the woman he fell in love with in Ireland. When he discovers the truth about Isolde, he is heartbroken to see her betrothed to Marke, but accepts it since the marriage will end the bloodshed between their two peoples. Marke is kind to Isolde and genuinely falls in love with her. Isolde grows fond of him, but her heart still belongs to Tristan. Tristan is cold and distant towards Marke, who is confused over what is tormenting Tristan. Isolde tells Tristan that she is his anytime he wants. Tristan is torn between his love for Isolde and his loyalty to Marke. Tristan eventually gives in to Isolde; they renew their love and begin an affair. The affair is discovered by Lord Wictred, a Saxon chieftain and a longstanding dissenter to Marke's leadership. He informs Donachadh and they conspire to use the affair to overthrow Marke, with Wictred getting Marke's throne in exchange. Marke confides in Tristan that he believes Isolde is having an affair. Tristan is tormented by the guilt and burns down the bridge where he would meet Isolde. After Marke and Isolde's coronation, Tristan attempts to end their relationship, but Isolde begs him not to leave her. They are caught in an embrace by Marke, Donnchadh, and the other British kings. Donachadh pretends to be furious that his daughter is being used as a \\"whore\\" and ends the alliance. Seeing this as weakness on Marke's part, the other kings also decide to part ways with him. Marke is hurt and furious over Tristan and Isolde's betrayal. However, after Isolde explains their history, Marke relents. Tristan is taken to the river and Isolde tells him that Marke is letting the two of them and Bragnae leave together. Tristan puts Isolde in the boat meant for their escape and tells her that if they leave they will be remembered for all time as those \\"whose love brought down a kingdom.\\" Tristan pushes the boat away from the shore and runs off to the ensuing battle. At the same time, Marke's nephew and Tristan's close friend, Melot, resentful of his uncle's long favoring of Tristan, shows Wictred an old passage into the Roman foundations of Marke's castle. Wictred had made Melot believe that he will become king when Marke is defeated. Once they are in the passage, Wictred stabs Melot and sneaks his army into the castle. Marke and his forces swiftly become pinned down by Donachadh's army outside the castle and Wictred's men within. Tristan sneaks back into the castle via the secret tunnel, which he and Isolde used to carry out their affair. On the way, he finds a dying Melot; the old friends forgive one another before Melot dies. Tristan attacks Wictred's men, allowing Marke's soldiers to secure the castle. Tristan is mortally wounded in combat by Wictred, whom he still manages to kill. Now outnumbered, Tristan, Marke and the soldiers loyal to him emerge from the castle and present Wictred's severed head to Donachadh. Marke urges the British kings standing with the Irish to aid them in making Britain a single, free nation. Inspired by his words, the British kings and their men attack Donachadh and his army. As a fierce battle between the British and Irish erupts, Marke carries a dying Tristan to the river, where they are met by Isolde. Marke has to leave to lead the British to victory, leaving Tristan and Isolde to say their final goodbye. Before he takes his last breath, he tells her: \\"You were right. I don't know if life is greater than death. But love was more than either.\\" Isolde sees to Tristan's burial beneath the ashes of the Roman villa where they had met to be with each other. She plants two willows by the grave, which grow intertwined. She then disappears from history and is never seen again. Marke went on to defeat the Irish, unite Britain, and rule in peace until the end of his days. ==Cast== * James Franco as Tristan ** Thomas Sangster as young Tristan * Sophia Myles as Isolde * Rufus Sewell as Lord Marke of Cornwall * Mark Strong as Lord Wictred * Henry Cavill as Melot * David O'Hara as King Donnchadh * Bronagh Gallagher as Bragnae ==Production== In the mid-1970s, before the beginning of the filming of The Duellists, Ridley Scott pitched the idea of a film adaptation of medieval romantic legend of Tristan and Iseult, and he planned to release this film as his second movie. However, the project never materialized at the time, and Scott pitched the idea of Legend during the filming of The Duellists as a replacement of this project. The film was finally released in 2006 with Kevin Reynolds as the director and with Scott as the producer. ==Release== ===Box office=== Tristan & Isolde opened theatrically in 1,845 North American venues on January 13, 2006. In its first weekend, the film earned $6,583,135 and ranked eighth in the domestic box office. The film ended its run on March 30, having grossed $28,047,963. ===Critical reception=== The film received mixed to negative reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 31% score based on 121 reviews, with an average rating of 4.88/10. The site's consensus states: \\"Competent but somewhat static, Tristan & Isolde doesn't achieve the sweeping romanticism that it aims for.\\" Metacritic reports a 49 out of 100 based on 30 reviews, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Manohla Dargis of The New York Times writes, \\"there is something undeniably pleasant about an entertainment like Tristan & Isolde that delivers exactly what it promises, no less, no more.\\" She adds: \\"There is some fairly bloodless fighting and some very chaste lovemaking.\\"Manohla Dargis, \\"Young Lovers in a Cave Can't Escape the World\\", The New York Times, January 13, 2006. ==See also== * List of historical drama films * Late Antiquity * List of films based on Arthurian legend * Tristan and Iseult ==References* * Category:2006 films Category:20th Century Fox films Film Category:2006 romantic drama films Category:2000s war drama films Category:Adultery in films Category:2000s action drama films Category:American epic films Category:American films Category:American romantic drama films Category:American war drama films Category:Arthurian films Category:British epic films Category:British films Category:British romantic drama films Category:British war drama films Category:Czech films Category:Czech romantic drama films Category:Czech war drama films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Kevin Reynolds Category:Films set in Cornwall Category:Films set in Ireland Category:Films set in the 6th century Category:Films shot in the Czech Republic Category:German epic films Category:German films Category:German romantic drama films Category:German war drama films Category:Romantic epic films Category:Scott Free Productions films Category:War epic films Category:Franchise Pictures films Category:Films set in the Middle Ages Category:Films scored by Anne Dudley Category:Films produced by Elie Samaha Category:2006 drama films ","title":"Tristan &amp; Isolde (film)"},{"id":"3235062","text":"Alfred \\"Pepsi\\" Bethel (August 31, 1918, Greensboro, North Carolina – August 30, 2002, New York City) was a jazz dancer, choreographer, and leader of his own dance troupe, the Pepsi Bethel Authentic Jazz Dance Theater, which he founded in 1960.Terry Monaghan, Pepsi Bethel, Lindy-hopping jazz dancer who choreographed the celebratory revue One Mo' Time, The Guardian September 27, 2002 ==Career== He began his career with dances like the Cakeywalk, Lindy hop, and Charleston at the Savoy Ballroom in Harlem, and worked with the Mura Dehn Jazz Ballet and other companies before forming his own troupe.

It was formed during the last months of World War II to operate the Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighter. The commander of JV 44 was General Adolf Galland, the former General der Jagdflieger (General of Fighter pilots) who had recently been sacked from his staff post by Hermann Göring for criticizing the operational policies, strategic doctrine, and tactics mandated by the Luftwaffe High Command in the \\"Fighter Pilots' Revolt\\". Galland was charged with setting up a small Me 262 unit to demonstrate the capabilities of the jet fighter. JV 44 comprised a core of experienced pilots (Experten) chosen from Galland's former staff or recruited from units which had been disbanded or were being re-equipped. JV 44 performed well during its brief history, achieving a 4-to-1 kill ratio. However, it had relatively few operational jet planes available for any single sortie and was repeatedly forced to relocate due to the approach of Allied ground forces. Its complement included 50 pilots and 25 airplanes.

In his active days, Hamilton was best known as one half of the tag team The Assassins where he was called \\"Assassin #1\\". When the Assassins ended, Hamilton wrestled as \\"The Assassin\\" and \\"The Flame\\" both while wearing a mask. Hamilton teamed up with Tom Renesto in late 1961 to form the masked heel (bad guy) team known as \\"The Assassins\\" and, for over a decade, Hamilton and Renesto wrestled all over the world with great success. Once Renesto retired, Hamilton kept the Assassins team alive by partnering with wrestlers such as Randy Colley and \\"Hercules\\" Hernandez under the trademark gold and black masks of the Assassins. In the late 1980s, Hamilton founded Deep South Wrestling (DSW), where he also wrestled until a back injury forced him to retire in 1988. After Deep South Wrestling closed, Hamilton worked extensively for World Championship Wrestling both on the booking team and later on as a trainer at WCW's Power Plant training facility. In 2005, Hamilton reopened Deep South Wrestling, this time as an affiliate of World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), to train wrestlers the WWE had signed to developmental contracts. In 2007, WWE abruptly ended their contract with DSW and the promotion suspended operations later in the year. ==Biography== Hamilton was born in St. Joseph, Missouri. Before turning professional, Hamilton was a promising amateur boxer, but instead of continuing his training, he decided that he wanted to follow in the footsteps of his older brother Larry Hamilton. Larry was a professional wrestler billed as \\"The Missouri Mauler\\". Hamilton started working for \\"Gust Karras Promotions\\", a professional wrestling promotion based in Kansas City, Missouri, where he made his debut against Rip Hawk in a 40-minute match. By 1957, Hamilton had started teaming with his brother Larry and worked as a full-time professional wrestler. The Hamilton Brothers worked for the New York, NY based Capitol Wrestling, (the precursor to World Wrestling Entertainment), where they were put in a storyline with the top tag team of the promotion Antonino Rocca and Miguel Pérez. In May 1958, the Hamilton Brothers faced Rocca and Pérez in the main event of a Madison Square Garden show making Jody, age 19 at the time, the youngest man to ever co-star in a main event at Madison Square Garden. After the Hamilton brothers time in New York, Jody Hamilton decided to strike out on his own working as a singles wrestler. As a singles wrestler, Hamilton first got a promotional push by NWA Western States booker, Doc Sarpolis, who billed him as \\"Silent\\" Joe Hamilton. Hamilton has revealed in recent years that the \\"Silent\\" moniker was because he was not very good at interviews and promos. After working in Texas, Hamilton worked in Oklahoma and Florida. When Hamilton left Florida in 1961, he intended to return to Oklahoma, but an offer from Georgia Championship Wrestling (GCW) would change the direction of Hamilton's career for good. ===Masked Assassins=== The original plan for Hamilton was that he was going to wrestle under a mask as \\"The Iron Russian\\", but once Hamilton got to Atlanta the plans had changed and instead he became “The Assassin”. After working as a singles competitor Hamilton was given a partner in late 1961, another masked Assassin, Tom Renesto. Renesto had teamed with Hamilton's older brother Larry but the two did not know each other before stepping into the ring in December 1961. The team worked well together from the onset and soon moved up the card towards the main events. For over a dozen years Hamilton and Renesto teamed together as the \\"vile\\" Assassins, a team hated for their \\"rulebreaking ways\\" wherever they wrestled. The Assassins, or the Masked Assassins as they were sometimes billed, worked all over the world for promotions in Georgia, California, Australia, the Far East, Japan and Canada. The only place the duo did not work as the Assassins was in the Carolinas where they were billed as \\"The Great Bolo\\" (Renesto) and \\"The Mighty Bolo\\" (Hamilton) because Renesto had worked for Jim Crockett Promotions as The Great Bolo before teaming up with Hamilton, and was more known in that region under the Bolo name. The Assassins longest stay with one promotion was from 1968 to 1972 where they worked for Georgia Championship Wrestling and held the NWA Georgia Tag Team Championship a record breaking 12 times. While in Georgia the team worked storylines with teams such as ”the Torres Brothers” (Ramon and Alberto), Terry and Dory Funk and the team of Ray Gunkel and Buddy Fuller. Their most successful and profitable feud came against the team of ”Tiny” Smith and Luke Brown known as \\"The Kentuckians\\". the matches between the Assassins and the Kentuckians drew sell out crowds up the east coast of the United States from Florida to the Carolinas. At times the Assassins would be backed up by Jody's brother the Missouri Mauler to take on the Kentuckians and their \\"fellow hillbilly\\" Haystacks Calhoun. During their time in GCW Renesto became more and move involved in the booking of the promotion in the hopes of turning a decline in attendance around. Renesto is credited with turning the territory around with a series of hotly contested angles that brought the fans back. In 1972 after GCW owner Ray Gunkel died Gunkel's widow Ann Gunkel split off from the National Wrestling Alliance associated GCW and started her own company \\"All-South Wrestling\\" with Tom Renesto as the head booker. With his backstage responsibilities expanded Renesto cut back on his wrestling dates as Hamilton was pushed as a singles wrestler. In October 1972 Renesto unmasked on television, rumor has it that GCW was going to publish pictures of the Assassins without their masks on and Renesto wanted to beat them to the punch. After the unmasking Renesto would still occasionally team with Hamilton both with and without the mask but the glory days of the Assassins ended when Renesto took off the mask. ===After Renesto=== When All-South Wrestling folded in 1974 both Hamilton and Renesto returned to Georgia Championship Wrestling, deciding to bury any past animosity. Renesto retired from the ring and focused more on the booking aspects of GCW while Hamilton started to work as a singles wrestler billed simply as \\"The Assassin\\". When he joined GCW Hamilton started a storyline with Mr. Wrestling II that would become the longest running storyline in Georgia wrestling history. Over the following years the Assassin would enlist several other \\"Assassins\\" to team with him as he fought against Mr. Wrestling II and various face partners. One of these partners was Randy Colley, who would go on to greater success as one of The Moondogs in the 1980s. Together Hamilton and Colley would hold the NWA Georgia Tag Team Championship on two occasions. Colley and Roger Smith would team together as the Assassins in Memphis. While GCW was Hamilton's \\"home promotion\\" he also competed for other promoters all over the south east especially in Florida and Alabama working for promotions such as Championship Wrestling from Florida, NWA Mid-America and Southeast Championship Wrestling. Hamilton used his “Assassin” gimmick but did not find another partner to recreate the Assassins, instead he would team with local stars such as Ron Fuller and Don Carson. By the beginning of the 1980s Hamilton decided to return to his roots in Oklahoma, after having worked more or less exclusively in the south east for ten years or more. First he worked for Central States Wrestling where he teamed with both Ernie Ladd and Angel to win the local version of the NWA United States Tag Team title. He would also hold the NWA Central States Heavyweight Championship, which was the main title for the promotion. After working for Central States Hamilton switched to Bill Watts’ Mid-South Wrestling promotion. In Mid-South Hamilton teamed up with yet another “Assassin #3”, this time it was ”Hercules” Hernandez under the gold and black mask. Hernandez run under the golden mask ended when he was unmasked by Jimmy Valiant after a match in Toronto, Ontario as part of Valiant's lengthy feud with Paul Jones’ army. In the mid 1980s Hamilton retired the golden mask and adopted a new ring identity: \\"The Flame\\", together with another masked man going by the name “Fire”, he won the AWA Southern Tag Team Championship in 1986. He would also hold the NWA Southeast Continental Heavyweight Championship on four occasions. ===Deep South Championship Wrestling=== In 1986 Hamilton started a small independent promotion in Georgia called Deep South Championship Wrestling. Hamilton would work both backstage and in the ring under his “Flame” ring persona. One night in 1988 Hamilton was thrown from the top rope during a match and landed wrong, the fall caused him to break the lumbar vertebrae in his back. Because Hamilton was in no shape to run a wrestling promotion he sold it to someone else, only to see that person go out of business without ever putting on a wrestling show. ===Retirement from the ring=== Once Hamilton recovered from his back injury he opened the official training center for World Championship Wrestling, the Power Plant. With Hamilton as director of the school it produced talent such as Kevin Nash, Diamond Dallas Page, Bill Goldberg, and the Big Show over the years. As well as working at the Power Plant Hamilton was also used as a manager in 1993, mainly managing Paul Orndorff, in addition to Orndorff's tag team partners The Equalizer and Paul Roma. Hamilton's last on-screen appearance in WCW was at WCW Starrcade '93 on December 27, 1993, as The Assassin and managing Pretty Wonderful (\\"Pretty\\" Paul Roma and \\"Mr. Wonderful\\" Paul Orndorff) to the WCW World Tag Team Championship. Hamilton was inducted into the WCW Hall of Fame as part of the 1994 class on May 22, 1994 at The Civic Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. When WCW was bought out by the WWF in March 2001 the Power Plant was closed but Hamilton continued to train wrestlers. ===Deep South Wrestling=== In 2005, World Wrestling Entertainment (formerly World Wrestling Federation) reached an agreement with Hamilton wherein Hamilton would open a new version of Deep South Wrestling for WWE to use as a training ground. The company ran shows on a regular basis featuring WWE-contracted talent until April 18, 2007, when WWE ended its relationship with DSW. DSW ceased operations the next day in 2007, although DSW held its final event on April 12. ===Rampage Pro Wrestling=== In February 2009, Hamilton officially returned to the business, joining Rampage Pro Wrestling, an independent promotion based out of Warner Robins, Georgia. He was the director of their television show that airs locally on multiple channels in the middle Georgia area. His son, Nick Patrick, also joined the promotion, though only in the on-camera commissioner role. In April 2009, the promotion released Hamilton, citing that they needed to cut costs. Nick stayed on with the promotion and took over his father's job as the television show director. The company brought Hamilton back later in the year in October. Hamilton and Patrick became heavily involved in producing the company's weekly television show that aired in the Middle Georgia area on the local FOX affiliate. ==Lawsuit against WWE== On January 22, 2010, Hamilton settled with WWE out of court. His attorney claimed that WWE \\"fraudulently contrived a reason to end the agreement\\" without giving the 90-days notice that was required in the contract. The suit also claimed that WWE illegally entered the Deep South building in McDonough, GA and took property that belonged to Hamilton. It also claims that the WWE Executive Vice President of Talent Relations, John Laurinaitis, warned that any wrestlers who continued to work with Deep South or Hamilton would never work in the wrestling business ever again.

Tajbeg Palace in 1987. Tajbeg Palace or Tapa-e-Tajbeg (; ; Palace of the Large Crown), also inaccurately called the Queen's Palace, is a palace built in the 1920s and located about 10 miles (16 km) south-west outside the centre of Kabul, Afghanistan. The once stately mansion sits atop a knoll among foothills where the Afghan royal family once hunted and picnicked. It should not be confused with Darul Aman Palace, which is about northeast from Tajbeg Palace. Built to house the Afghan royal family, Tajbeg Palace is one of the most impressive landmarks of \\"Darulaman,\\" newly created during the era of Amānullāh Khān by a team of European architects in an attempt to establish a new seat of government and modernise Afghanistan, both of which ultimately failed when religious conservatives forced Amānullāh from power and halted his reforms. The palace was eventually used as governmental and military houses until it was damaged, leaving it in ruins. ==History== Not far from the castle or Tapa e Taj Beg (Taj Beg hill), a palace for the Queen of the Timurids is said to have been found a long time ago. Terraced garden designs were preferred by Timurids and Moguls, and today some ruins remain. The Timurids and their successors, the Moguls, have kinship relations with the Pashtun tribes of Abdali Durrani and later Yusufzai. The daughter-in-law of Ahmad Khan Abdali (the wife of Timur Shah Durrani) was the daughter of Alamgir II. According to some historians, the palace seems to have been renovated by Zaman Shah Durrani in 1795 (1210 AH), which was subsequently destroyed in military conflicts, and the ruins from ancient times remain. Foreign soldiers of ISAF have documented ruins of the former castle.http://afghanistanmylasttour.com/tag/tajbeg-palace/ 14th century Mongol ruins, the historical Taj Beg Palace On December 27, 1979, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics launched its intervention in Afghanistan. That evening, the Soviet military launched Operation Storm-333, in which some 700 troops, including 54 KGB spetsnaz special forces troops from the Alpha Group and Zenith Group, stormed the Palace and killed President Hafizullah Amin, who had resided there since December 20.Humanitarian Invasion: Global Development in Cold War Afghanistan by Timothy Nunan During the Soviet–Afghan War it served as the headquarters of the Soviet 40th Army. The palace was severely damaged in the years after the Soviet withdrawal, when different mujahideen factions fought for control of Kabul after the fall of President Najibullah's Moscow- backed government in 1992. The Afghan government, in conjunction with the German government, have drafted plans for renovating the palace for official use, requiring funds from private donations from wealthy Afghans. These plans were on indefinite hold as the Afghan government seeks to establish peace and stability. A similar plan was approved for the nearby Darul Aman Palace which was completely renovated and opened to the public on Afghan Indendence Day, August 2019. The Palace is (as of October 2019) undergoing restoration.{{cite weburl=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGyg- Wq0WVA&list;=WL&index;=10title=Zaman-Tajbeg Palace Kabul - Afghanistan ==Gallery== Tajbeg Palace, Kabul - panoramio.jpgTajbeg Palace in 2012 Tajbeg Palace, Darulaman, Kabul - panoramio.jpgBird's eye view of the palace in 2012 The ruined 'Queen's Palace',Kabul -e.jpgThe ruined palace Queens Palace (5300182685).jpgThe ruined palace Дворец со стороны правого крыла 27 12 79.jpgPhotograph of the palace's west side during the Soviet assault on 27 December 1979 ==See also== * Beg (title) * Taj Mahal * Darul Aman Palace *Bagh-e Bala Palace ==References== ==External links== *www.Darulaman.de – (At the moment only in German – English will follow.) *Qasr-e Taj Beg Category:Palaces in Afghanistan Category:Buildings and structures in Kabul Province Category:Houses completed in the 20th century Category:Royal residences in Afghanistan Category:Ruined palaces Category:1920s establishments in Afghanistan ","title":"Tajbeg Palace"},{"id":"3235122","text":"Adam Afriyie speaks in a Ten Minute Rule debate, circa 2012 The Ten Minute Rule, also known as Standing Order No. 23, is a procedure in the Parliament of the United Kingdom for the introduction of Private Member's Bills in addition to the 20 per session normally permissible. It is one of the ways in which a bill may receive its first reading. == Introduction of the bill == Any MP may introduce a bill under the Ten Minute Rule, although in practice it is only used by backbenchers. To qualify to introduce a bill under the Rule, the MP in question must be the first through the door to the Public Bill Office on the Tuesday or Wednesday morning fifteen working days (usually three weeks) prior to the date they wish to introduce their bill. Due to the popularity of the Rule and the difficulty in launching a Private Member's Bill by other means, MPs have been known to sleep outside the Public Bill Office in order to guarantee a slot. In 2014 three MPs agreed a sleeping rota between themselves in order to ensure that they were first in the queue. == Debate == Ten Minute Rule motions are held in the main Commons Chamber after question time, at around 12:45pm on most Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Whichever MP has reserved the slot presents their bill and is entitled to speak for 10 minutes to convince the house of its merit. After the 10 minutes have passed, another MP may speak for a further 10 minutes to oppose the bill. The Speaker then calls a voice vote to decide whether the bill should be allowed a second reading, which is when the bill is debated at a later date. The Speaker will divide the house for a recorded count of votes if there is some opposition. However, the majority of Ten Minute Rule motions are not objected to, and are allowed to proceed without any debate at this stage. This is because MPs have not yet had time to review the bill's content. == Progression towards becoming law == When a Ten Minute Rule motion passes, the bill is added to the register of parliamentary business. It is scheduled for debate along with the other Private Member's Bills, but at a lower priority. The MP presenting the bill must tell the Speaker the date for this second reading debate. The bill is generally printed and published shortly before the second reading. Bills introduced under the Ten Minute Rule rarely progress much further, since the Government usually opposes Private Member's Bills in the later stages and, given their low priority in the schedule, there is often insufficient time for the legislative process to be completed before the end of the parliamentary session. Most Ten Minute Rule introductions are instead used to stimulate publicity for a cause, especially as the debate follows the media-popular question time and is usually broadcast live on BBC Parliament, or to gauge the opinion of the house on an issue which may later be introduced in another bill. However, bills introduced under the Ten Minute Rule do sometimes become law, passing through every stage of Parliament right through to Royal Assent. Since 1945, there have been over sixty Acts of Parliament which were initially introduced under the Ten Minute Rule. A recent example was the Divorce (Religious Marriages) Act 2002. A famous bill introduced under the Ten Minute Rule was the Military Action Against Iraq (Parliamentary Approval) Bill in 1999, which provoked a denial of Queen's Consent for its progression to a second reading. == See also == *List of Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom ==References== Category:Parliament of the United Kingdom ","title":"Ten Minute Rule"},{"id":"3235135","text":"The United Africa Company of Nigeria is a Nigerian publicly listed company based in Lagos. Its areas of operation include manufacturing, services, logistics and warehousing, agricultural and real estate. UACN's food operations include UAC Franchising, UAC Restaurants and UAC Dairies. It also has equity stake in UACN Property Development Company, a quoted firm, CAP Plc, makers of Dulux paints and Portland Paints, manufacturers of Sandtex paints. A former chairman of the board was Senator Udoma U.Udoma when Mr Larry Ettah was serving as Group Managing Director and CEO in 2010. ==History== UAC Nigeria also known as UACN was first incorporated in Nigeria under the name Nigerian Motors Ltd on April 22, 1931 as a wholly owned subsidiary of the United Africa Company Ltd, the firm that later became UAC International (UACI). UAC International, a subsidiary of Unilever, included in its business, the trading activities formerly carried on by a number of other companies including The Niger Company Ltd. and the African and Eastern Trade Corporation Ltd, all of which had long-standing trading links with West Africa. ===Produce buying and merchandise trade period=== At inception, United Africa Company of Nigeria was a subsidiary of UACI's group of companies in Nigeria, a group that was incorporated to transact in selected markets within the country. Many of these companies later became divisions under UAC of Nigeria in 1973 following a consolidation exercise. UACN's business activities was initially in the auto trade market but soon expanded into other areas. Strategic to its business conduct in Nigeria, the firm believed in the development of the economy and an improvement in the income of farmers and Nigerians as key to its success, this belief partly motivated its drive to expand into other areas of business. A major segment of the firm was produce buying of cash crops from local farmers for export to foreign markets. This activity also involved extension of credit to traders and middlemen who went into the hinterland to source for quality grades of produce. The firm operated in this market through staffing of personnel at different buying stations or through the use of traders and middlemen. When marketing boards were created for major cash crops such as palm kernels, Cocoa and groundnuts, UAC of Nigeria was appointed as one of the licensed buying agents. The company also traded in other agricultural products not regulated by the government such as hides and skins, beeswax, rubber, shea nut, castor seed, piassava, kapok, coffee, copra and gum. The revenue from the sale of agricultural produce was used to import various goods for sale in the Nigerian market. The firm's trade in consumer goods such as shirts, shoes, electrical appliances and mechanical equipment involved importation from various countries of the world, a process overseen by its parent company. Many goods distributed by the company were sold by middlemen or associate companies such as Kingsway Stores. The firm also managed transportation of bulk palm oil at buying points and storage at various ports in the country for onward distribution to foreign markets. The firm had a fleet of river crafts operating within the internal water ways of the country, an operation that was managed out of UAC's office at Burutu. In addition, the firm helped to introduce new machinery for many pioneer oil mills in Eastern Nigeria. ===Restructuring period=== The company, whose name was changed to United Africa Company Ltd in 1943, retained the name until 1955 when it became The United Africa Company of Nigeria Ltd and started acquiring, over a period of five years, a large part of the business of UAC International. In 1960 C.W.A. Holdings Ltd, England also a subsidiary of Unilever, acquired the interest of UAC International in the company. Further re-organisation concluded in 1973 and resulted in the acquisition of a number of wholly owned fellow subsidiaries of C.W.A. Holdings. In 1968, Niger House, the new head office of UACN was completed. The 12 storey building was built by Taylor Woodrow and has adjacent structures including an 8-storey building at the rear. Following re- organisation, the company conducted the acquired businesses as operating divisions, which are now in voluntary liquidation. The company took the name UAC of Nigeria Ltd in 1973. In compliance with the Nigerian Enterprises Promotion Act 1972, 40 percent of the company's share capital was acquired in 1974 by Nigerian citizens and associations and in accordance with the provisions of the Nigerian Enterprises Promotion Act 1977, an additional 20 percent of the UAC's share capital was publicly offered in 1977, increasing Nigerian equity participation to 60 percent. The name UACN Plc was adopted in 1991. ==Historical divisions== From 1973 onwards, UACN managed many of the Nigerian assets of its parent company.. At a point in time, the company managed 22 divisions and subsidiaries. ===Kingsway stores=== Kingsway Stores was a department store headquartered in Lagos and managed by the firm. It was the first modern departmental store established in British West Africa. The first Kingsway store was opened in Lagos in 1948 and by 1982, the firm had 13 stores across major cities in the country including a three-storey store at Ibadan. The stores initially provided access to consumer goods found in departmental stores of foreign countries, but over time, majority of its SKUs were procured in Nigeria. Towards the end of the 1980s, price and currency regulations and a downturn in the economy forced the closure of many stores and eventually the closure of Kingsway Stores. ===Textiles=== UAC's textile division was one of the largest textile distributors in Nigeria. The division was formed as combination of the textile businesses of UAC and G.B Ollivant. At its height the company designed and distributed wax prints. ===A.J. Seward=== A.J. Seward was a manufacturer of personal care products that was majority owned by UAC International, the firm was formally introduced to Nigeria in 1968. Prior to the incorporation of A.J. Seward in Nigeria, UAC's department of drugs and personal care handled the importation of Seward's products. The department was later merged with a newly formed A.J. Seward Nigeria limited. The firm began operations marketing importing toiletries before establishing a personal and hair care factory at Zaria and later at Oregun, Lagos. In 1980, the company's main warehouse was opened in Oregun, Lagos. Many of the firm's products became popular such as Pears baby care products, Nku, Lotus, Jellen, Fresh and Shield. ===Tractor and Equipment=== T and E or Tractor and Equipment handled the franchise to sell Caterpillar trucks in Nigeria. UAC's relationships with CAT officially began in 1950. Mining of tin in Jos had created a market for mining equipment which prodded the firm to begin selling mining machinery in the country. The firm's product also included CAT's agricultural, infrastructure maintenance and marine engineering products. The firm also sold Braithwaite steel tanks and storage products. ===Foods division=== UAC International established a consumer food trading arm in 1958 called West African Cold Storage. The firm later merged with Wall's Company. In 1973, the company was collapsed into UACN to become its Food division. The division markets meat related products and cold storage of food and meat products. ===African Timber and Plywood=== The firm operated African Time and Plywood from Sapele in Delta State. The facility was an expansion of an old saw mill originally managed by Miller Bros out of Koko, Delta State. The firm transferred the old saw mill at Koko to Sapele in 1929. Between 1945 and 1951, additional investments were poured into the facility. A plywood mill was commissioned in 1948 and the old mill was replaced in 1951. Major sources of wood were Iroko and Mahogany trees with one species known as Sapele mahogany. Initially the products of the mills were mostly for foreign markets but an expanding local market caused an inwards focus to generate sales. The products of the firm included cresta branded plywood, ATAPEX particle board, flushed doors and furniture. ===Federated motors=== Federated Motors assembled Bedford trucks from completely knocked down parts. UAC international's involvement in the motor trade dates back to its early years when it imported Bedford trucks into the country. The firm later imported partially assembled chassis and cabs before assembling knocked down parts. The firm's factory at Apapa churned out trucks with payloads between 1 and 8 tonnes. The firm also sold Bedford buses including its BF model used by commercial transport companies. ==Operations== In 1994, Unilever which had a minority stake in UACN, divested its interest which were sold to local investors. UACN has divested from many of its legacy divisions, its current business operation is led by food related products managed through its UAC Foods, UAC Dairies, Grand Cereal and Oil Mills and UAC Restaurants strategic business divisions. In addition to food products, the firm is involved in property development through interest in the publicly listed UACN Property Development Corporation and also in logistics through MDS logistics. The firm acquired significant interest in Chemical and Allied Products Plc, makers of Dulux paints and in Livestock Feeds Plc. ==Products== UACN markets brands such as Mr Biggs fast food restaurants, SWAN Water (natural spring water repositioned from 2013 to the top of the category by its sales team), Gala, Grand oils, Supreme Ice Cream. UAC Dairies markets Supreme Ice Creams and through Grand Cereal and Oil Mills, UACN produces and markets Grand Pure cooking oil brands. Mr. Biggs was founded in 1986, an idea that began as a coffee shop in Marina, Lagos Island. The fast food operation is in more than 170 locations across 29 states of Nigeria. Apart from Mr. Biggs, the firm also manages other fast food restaurants such as Village Kitchen, Chicken Inn, Pizza Inn and Creamy Inn. ==See also== *List of Nigerian companies *Economy of Nigeria ==References== ==External links== *United Africa Company of Nigeria PLC website Category:Manufacturing companies of Nigeria ","title":"United Africa Company of Nigeria"},{"id":"3235139","text":"V. Volodarsky (; December 11, 1891 - June 20, 1918) was a Marxist revolutionary and early Soviet politician. He was assassinated in 1918. ==Biography== ===Early years=== Moisei Markovich Goldstein (later V. Volodarsky) was born to an ethnic Jewish family in Ostropol, in the Volhynian Governorate of the Russian Empire (present-day Ukraine). ===Revolutionary politics=== In 1905, he became involved in revolutionary activity within the General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia, but soon joined Spilka, the Ukrainian Social Democratic organisation which aligned itself with the Menshevik faction of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party.Most sources, for instance Boris Souvarine's Stalin: A Critical Survey of Bolshevism (Longmans, Green & Co., first edition 1939, p. 161) claim that Volodarsky was a Menshevik prior to 1917. However, Michael Glenny, the editor of the 1967 translation of Anatoly Lunacharsky's Revolutionary Silhouettes, writes that \\"he was exiled to Archangel while still a schoolboy for 'political unreliability'. In 1905 he joined the Bund, later the 'Spilka' or Ukrainian S.R. Party. Arrested in 1911, he was again sent to Archangel.\\" He was briefly imprisoned in 1908 and then was politically active in Volhynia. Then in 1911 he was exiled by the government to Arkhangelsk, but was included in the general amnesty of 1913. Continued persecution led him to emigrate to the United States,Edward Hallett Carr, The Bolshevik Revolution, 1917-1923, volume 3 [1953], New York: W.W. Norton, 1985; p. 143. settling in Philadelphia. Here he became active in the International Trade Union of Tailors and the Socialist Party. During World War I, Volodarsky sided with the internationalist Mensheviks and moved to the left. In 1916-1917, he was a contributor to the New York-based newspaper of the Russian Socialist Federation, Novy Mir (New World), edited by Nikolai Bukharin.John Glad (ed.), \\"A Chronology\\" in Conversations in Exile: Russian Writers Abroad. Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 1993; p. 275 ===Return to Russia=== In May 1917, Volodarsky returned to Russia, joined the Mezhraiontsy group and was elected to the Petrograd City Duma. Along with the rest of the mezhraiontsy, he joined the Bolsheviks at the 6th Party Congress in July–August 1917 and soon became one of their best known public speakers and agitators.John Reed, Ten Days That Shook the World, first edition Boni and Liverlight, Inc. 1919 (Penguin Books, 1977, p. 83) He focused his activity in the Petergof area, including the Putilov factory. In mid- October 1917, while the Bolsheviks were debating whether to try to overthrow the Russian Provisional Government, Volodarsky sided with Grigory Zinoviev and Lev Kamenev, who were against the insurrection.Leon Trotsky, The History of the Russian Revolution, volume 3: The Triumph of the Soviets, Chapter 42 , Lenin Summons to Insurrection At the Second Congress of Soviets during the October Revolution of 1917, Volodarsky was elected to the All-Russian Central Executive Committee (VTsIK). He was appointed editor of the Red Gazette in Petrograd and chief of the Press Division of the Executive Committee of the Union of Northern Communes. This gave him broad censorship powers. His colleague Anatoly Lunacharsky wrote: : And he was ruthless. He was imbued not only with the full menace of the October Revolution, but with a foretaste of the outbursts of Red terror which were to come after his death. There is no sense in concealing the fact that Volodarsky was a terrorist. He was profoundly convinced that if we were to falter in lashing out at the hydra of counter-revolution it would devour not only us but along with us the hopes that October had raised all over the world. He was against the Brest-Litovsk Treaty, but remained silent on the topic in order to maintain party discipline. ===Death=== Volodarsky was assassinated on June 20, 1918 by Grigory Ivanovich Semyonov, a member of the Central Battle Unit of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party, during labor unrest at the Obukhov Works in Petrograd. He was buried at the Monument to the Fighters of the Revolution on St Petersburg's Field of Mars. ===Honors=== Monument beside Volodarsky Bridge, St Petersburg In 1918, the town of Poshekhonye was renamed Poshekhonye- Volodarsk (Пошехо́нье-Волода́рск). It reverted to its original name in 1992. The town Volodarsk was named after him in 1920. The sewing factory established at the seized Esders and Scheefhaals department store in 1919 was named in Goldstein's honor in 1922. Streets throughout the USSR were named in his honor; see a partial list in Russian Wikipedia. The Volodarsky Bridge, located near where he was killed, was named after him.

Francis Galton and Charles Darwin were his nephews. == Biography == === Early life === Francis Sacheverel was a son of Erasmus Darwin and his second wife Elizabeth (née) Collier, widow of Col Edward Pole and natural daughter of Charles Colyear, 2nd Earl of Portmore. He was an uncle (and godfather) of Francis Galton, half-brother of Robert Waring Darwin and a half-uncle of Charles Darwin. He graduated from Emmanuel College, Cambridge. === Travels === In 1808, at 22, he started with four others, one of whom was his brother- in-law Theodore Galton, on a tour through Spain, the Mediterranean and the Near East. Travelling was not then what it is now, and they came in contact with war, robbers, privateers and the plague in the diary of this two years' tour in the East. Of the five who started, only Darwin returned alive. The diary of the tour shows a keen antiquarian taste gratified under many difficulties, and it is recognised that Darwin not only loved adventure for its own sake, but was a born naturalist also, whose ready pencil followed a keen eye, where rock and mineral, plant and beast were concerned, as readily as when it portrayed an archaeological novelty or displayed the costumes of Greece or Turkey. Typical of the man is the account he gives of the plague in Smyrna; instead of flying from the place, he remarks > On the 2nd day we again found ourselves at Smyrna amongst the plague, which > had increased, 400 persons having died in our absence. I had now an > opportunity of watching the progress of this disorder in several English > sailors, who having been on shore, had caught the infection. I also visited > the Armenian, and Greek hospitals, where numbers were dying daily of the > plague (p. 55). At Smyrna also we hear the tale of a gun discharged immediately under the window, which their host informed them was the shooting of another cat by a soldier posted to shoot the cats coming out of the next house where everybody but the baby had died of plague; the cats being the chief transporters of the infection. Darwin, wanting more experience of the plague, on another return to Smyrna undertook by invitation of the native physicians charge of several hospitals, of which the Greek and Armenian contained each 120 patients. > This was a good opportunity to become conversant, with the diseases of the > climate, and from constant observation I found the plague was frequently > checked by an active practice of which the Medici of the East were totally > ignorant. Intermittent fevers and the Lepra Graecorum are very peculiar in > the Levant. Hard eggs and salt fish being the hospital diet, phthisis is > most prevalent. During the tour Darwin visited Tangiers, Tetuan, and attempted to get into Fes, not then visited by Europeans, but was not permitted to reach that closed centre of Islam. His wife's copy of her husband's diary was the source for Travels in Spain and the East, 1808-1810; by Sir Francis Sacheverell Darwin; [edited by F. D. S. Darwin]. Cambridge: University Press, 1927.The editor was a grandson of Sir Francis, his mother being Georgiana E. Swift, née Darwin === Marriage and children === On 16 December 1815 he married Jane Harriet Ryle (11 December 1794 - 19 April 1866) - at St. George, Hanover Square London.

He transmitted his love of natural history to his son Edward Levett Darwin, author (under the name of \\"Hugh Elms\\") of a 'Gamekeeper's Manual' (4th edition 1863), which shows keen observation of the habits of various animals. Darwin was knighted by George IV in 1820, and was also a Deputy Lieutenant of Derbyshire. Both he and his wife are buried at Breadsall Priory, and a memorial plaque to them and some of their family is located in All Saints' Church, Breadsall. == References == # * Karl Pearson, The Life, Letters and Labours of Francis Galton: at Google books Francis Sacheverel Darwin Category:1786 births Category:1859 deaths Category:People from Breadsall Category:Alumni of Emmanuel College, Cambridge Category:Knights Bachelor Category:Deputy Lieutenants of Derbyshire Category:Burials in Derbyshire ","title":"Francis Sacheverel Darwin"},{"id":"3235144","text":"Volodarsky (masculine), Volodarskaya (feminine), or Volodarskoye (neuter) may refer to: ;People *Boris Volodarsky (born 1955), English historian, specialising in Intelligence History *Eduard Volodarsky (1941–2012), Russian screenwriter, playwright and cinematographer *Leonid Volodarskiy (born 1950), Russian movie translator *Peter Wolodarski (born 1978), Swedish journalist and television host *V.

In 1982, the state became the first jurisdiction in the world to carry out an execution by lethal injection, when it put to death Charles Brooks Jr.. It was the first execution in the state since 1964. Texas, which is the second most populous state of the Union, has executed 570 offenders from the U.S. capital punishment resumption in 1976 (beginning in 1982 with the Brooks execution) to July 8, 2020 (the execution of Billy Joe Wardlow), more than a third of the national total. ==History== The first execution in Texas occurred in 1819 with the execution of a white male, George Brown, for piracy. In 1840, a free black male, Henry Forbes, was executed for jail- breaking. Prior to Texas statehood in 1846, eight executions—all by hanging—were carried out. Ellis Unit, which at one time housed the State of Texas male death row Upon statehood, hanging would be the method used for almost all executions until 1924. Hangings were administered by the county where the trial took place. The last hanging in the state was that of Nathan Lee, a man convicted of murder and executed in Angleton, Brazoria County, Texas on August 31, 1923. The only other method used at the time was execution by firing squad, which was used for three Confederate deserters during the American Civil War as well as a man convicted of attempted rape in 1863. In 1853 the first execution in Houston took place in public at Founder's Cemetery in the Fourth Ward; initially the cemetery was the execution site, but post-1868 executions took place in the jail facilities. Texas changed its execution laws in 1923, requiring the executions be carried out on the electric chair and that they take place at the Texas State Penitentiary at Huntsville (also known as Huntsville Unit). From 1928 until 1965, this was also home to the state's male death row. The first executions on the electric chair were on February 8, 1924, when Charles Reynolds, Ewell Morris, Harris Washington, Haden Cochran, and Melvin Johnson had their death sentences carried out. The five executions were the most carried out on a single day in the state. The state would conduct multiple executions on a single day on several other occasions, the last being on August 9, 2000. Since then, the state has not executed more than one person on a single day, though there is no law prohibiting it. A total of 361 people were electrocuted in Texas, with the last being Joseph Johnson on July 30, 1964. The United States Supreme Court decision in Furman v. Georgia (), which declared Georgia's \\"unitary trial\\" procedure (in which the jury was asked to return a verdict of guilt or innocence and, simultaneously, determine whether the defendant would be punished by death or life imprisonment) to be unconstitutional on the grounds that it was a cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution, essentially negated all death penalty sentences nationwide. As result of the Furman decision, the 52 Texas death-row inmates at the time had all their sentences reduced to life imprisonment. Among them was Kenneth McDuff, who was originally condemned for the murder of three teenagers in 1966. He was paroled in 1989 and executed in 1998 for a murder he committed while on parole, and is suspected to have been responsible for many other killings. Furman led to a 1973 revision of the laws, primarily by introducing the bifurcated trial process (where the guilt- innocence and punishment phases are separate) and narrowly limiting the legal definition of capital murder (and, thus, those offenses for which the death penalty could be imposed). The first person sentenced to death under a new Texas statute was John Devries on February 15, 1974; Devries hanged himself in his cell on July 1, 1974 (using bedsheets from his bunk) before he could be executed. The Supreme Court decision in Jurek v. Texas in 1976 once again allowed for the death penalty to be imposed. (Jurek was a companion case in the Gregg decision and was upheld by the Court; the Court stated that Texas' death penalty scheme could potentially result in fewer death penalty cases, an irony given that post-Gregg Texas has by far executed more inmates than any other state.) However, the first execution in Texas after this decision would not take place until December 7, 1982 with that of Charles Brooks, Jr.. Brooks was also the first person to be judicially executed by lethal injection in the world, and the first African American to be executed in the United States since 1967. In the post-Gregg era, Texas has executed 570 people. There are a variety of proposed legal and cultural explanations as to why Texas has more executions than any other state. One possible reason is due to the federal appellate structure - federal appeals from Texas are made to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. Michael Sharlot, dean of the University of Texas at Austin Law School, found the Fifth Circuit to be a \\"much more conservative circuit\\" than the Ninth Circuit to which federal appeals from California are made. According to him, the Fifth is \\"more deferential to the popular will\\" that is strongly pro-death penalty and creates few legal obstacles to execution within its jurisdiction.As quoted in Robert Bryce, \\"Why Texas is Execution Capital,\\" The Christian Science Monitor, December 14, 1998. As of 2004, however, Texas may have a lower rate of death sentencing than other states, according to a study by Cornell University.\\"Cornell study reveals surprising findings on death row, race and the most death penalty-prone states.\\" Cornell University. February 26, 2004. Retrieved on May 9, 2010. Texas has executed nine women in its history, the most recent being Lisa Ann Coleman on September 17, 2014. ==Capital crimes== Under Texas statutes, a murder is capital if the offender:Texas Penal Code § 19.03 #Murders a public safety officer (police officer, fireman, or EMT/paramedic) who is acting in the lawful discharge of an official duty and who the person knows is a police officer or fireman. There are current bills proposed to add EMT/paramedics. #Intentionally commits the murder in the course of committing or attempting to commit aggravated kidnapping, burglary, robbery, aggravated sexual assault, arson, obstruction or retaliation, or terroristic threat #Commits the murder for remuneration or the promise of remuneration or employs another to commit the murder for remuneration or the promise of remuneration #Commits the murder while escaping or attempting to escape from a penal institution #Commits the murder, while incarcerated, of a person who is employed in the operation of the penal institution or with the intent to establish, maintain, or participate in a combination (In Criminal Law, an agreement between two or more people to act jointly for an unlawful purpose; a conspiracy.) or in the profits of a combination #Commits the murder while incarcerated for murder; or while serving a sentence of life imprisonment or a term of 99 years for aggravated kidnapping, aggravated sexual assault or aggravated robbery #Murders more than one person during the same criminal transaction or during different criminal transactions but the murders are committed pursuant to the same scheme or course of conduct #Murders an individual under 15 years of age #Murders another person in retaliation for or on account of the service or status of the other person as a judge or justice of the supreme court, the court of criminal appeals, a court of appeals, a district court, a criminal district court, a constitutional county court, a statutory county court, a justice court, or a municipal court. Texas statute books still provide the death penalty for aggravated sexual assault committed by an offender previously convicted of the same against a child under 14. Under Texas law, offenders under 17 are not executed but the US Supreme Court in Roper v. Simmons has ruled capital punishment to be unconstitutional for those under 18 when the crime was committed. The highest age of a child murder victim, which can subject the murderer to the death penalty, was raised from six to 10 in 2011 by the Texas legislature then raised once again to 15 in 2019 (Lauren's Law). ==Legal procedure== The prosecution may choose not to seek the death penalty. This can be for various reasons, such as the prosecution believing that they could not show the defendant worthy of death, or the family of the victim has asked that the death penalty not be imposed. ===Trial phase=== When the prosecution seeks the death penalty, the sentence is decided by the jury. A death sentence must be unanimous, while a life sentence requires only 10 votes. In case of a hung jury during the penalty phase of the trial, a life sentence is issued, even if a single juror opposed death (there is no retrial). Jurors in the sentencing phase are first asked to determine whether the defendant represents a \\"future danger to society:In this context, \\"society\\" refers not only to the general public at large but also to the prison system; thus, a defendant who would pose a danger to those in prison -- such as other inmates, guards, or prison workers -- would be eligible for the death penalty.; only after ruling that \\"there is a probability that the defendant would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society\\" will the jury choose the sentence itself, by deciding whether there is \\"sufficient mitigating circumstance or circumstances to warrant that a sentence of life imprisonment without parole rather than a death sentence be imposed\\" or not. === Appeals === The imposition of a death sentence in Texas results in an automatic direct appeal to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, the state's court of last resort for criminal cases (the intermediate Texas Courts of Appeals are bypassed). A person convicted of capital murder may also challenge their convictions or sentences via writs of habeas corpus at both the state and federal levels. Texas's appeal process has been criticized as too lengthy compared to other states such as Virginia by death penalty supporters. In 2016, the legal director for the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation Kent Scheidegger said: \\"In Texas, part of the problem is some cases go back for a second review to the trial court and some trial courts just sit on them for years. That simply shouldn't be allowed.\\" ===Clemency=== In addition to seeking judicial review of the sentence, a defendant may also appeal to the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles, a separate agency from the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ), for commutation of the sentence to life in prison. The Board, after hearing testimony, decides whether or not to recommend commutation to the Governor of Texas. If the Board recommends commutation, the Governor can accept or reject the recommendation. However, if the board does not recommend commutation, the Governor has no power to override the Board's non-recommendation (the law was changed in 1936 due to concerns that pardons were being sold for cash under the administrations of former Governor James E. Ferguson and later his wife and Texas's first female Governor Miriam A. Ferguson).Texas State Libraries and Archives Commission: \\"Pardons and Paroles\\" retrieved October 20, 2011 The only unilateral action which the Governor can take is to grant a one-time, 30-day reprieve to the defendant, and can do so regardless of what the Board recommends in a particular case.Texas Administrative Code Title 37 PUBLIC SAFETY AND CORRECTIONS, Part 5 TEXAS BOARD OF PARDONS AND PAROLES, Chapter 143 EXECUTIVE CLEMENCY, Subchapter E COMMUTATION OF SENTENCE, Rule 143.57 Commutation of Death Sentence to Lesser Penalty retrieved August 20, 2011The Texas Constitution: Sec. 11.

Under Texas law, executions are carried out at or after 6 p.m. Huntsville (Central) time \\"by intravenous injection of a substance or substances in a lethal quantity sufficient to cause death and until such convict is dead\\". The law does not specify the substance(s) to be used; previously, according to the TDCJ, the chemicals used for the lethal injection were the commonly-used three-drug combination of (in order) sodium thiopental (a dose which sedates the offender, but not enough to kill outright), pancuronium bromide (a muscle relaxant which collapses the diaphragm and lungs), and potassium chloride (which stops the heartbeat). The offender is usually pronounced dead approximately seven minutes after start of the injection process; the cost for the three substances is $86.08 per offender. As a result of drug shortages, sodium thiopental was replaced by pentobarbital in 2011. Further shortages of this drug have pushed the cost of the drugs to approximately $1300 per offender. Still further shortages of pancuronium bromide (and the expiration of the existing stock) forced the state into switching to a single-drug protocol, using solely pentobarbital. The only persons legally allowed to be present (none of whom can be convicts) at the execution are: *the executioner \\"and such persons as may be necessary to assist him in conducting the execution\\" *the Board of Directors of the Department of Corrections *two physicians including the prison physician *the spiritual advisor of the condemned *the chaplains of the Department of Corrections *the county judge and sheriff of the county in which the crime was committed *no more than five relatives or friends of the condemned person In response to victims rights groups, TDCJ adopted a board rule in January 1996 allowing five victim witnesses (six for multiple victims). Initially the witnesses were limited to immediate family and individuals with a close relationship to the victim, but the board rule was modified in 1998 to allow close friends of surviving witnesses, and further modified in May 2008 to allow the victim witnesses to be accompanied by a spiritual advisor who is a bona fide pastor or comparable official of the victim's religion. ===Media coverage=== Five members of the media are also allowed to witness the execution, divided equally as possible between the rooms containing the offender's and victim's witnesses. Under current TDCJ guidelines, representatives of the Associated Press and The Huntsville Item (the local newspaper for Huntsville, Texas) are guaranteed two of the five slots to witness an execution. () \\"C. A representative from the Associated Press (AP) and a representative from the Huntsville Item are guaranteed an opportunity to witness each execution.\\" The Associated Press regularly sends a representative to cover executions; Michael Graczyk (formerly of the AP's Houston office; though retired from the AP he still reports on executions on a freelance basis) is usually the representative sent, having attended over 400 executions in his career. The Item also generally covers all executions, regardless of county of conviction. Other media members must submit their requests at least three days prior to the execution date; priority will be given to media members representing the area in which the capital crime took place. Generally, other newspapers will only cover executions where the crime was committed within their general circulation area (the Houston Chronicle is often one of them, with Harris County being the state's largest and having the most number of inmates on death row), and frequently even then will rely on the AP report. College and university media are not permitted to be witnesses. ===Post-execution=== Captain Joe Byrd Cemetery in Huntsville, the Texas Department of Criminal Justice prison cemetery for deceased prisoners, including executed prisoners, who are not reclaimed by their families Upon the offender's death the body shall be immediately embalmed, and shall be disposed of as follows: *A relative or bona fide friend of the offender may demand or request the body within 48 hours after death, upon payment of a fee not to exceed US$25 for the mortician's services in embalming the deceased; once TDCJ receives the receipt the body shall be released to the requestor or his/her authorized agent. *If no relative or bona fide friend requests the body, the Anatomical Board of the State of Texas may request the body, but must also pay the US$25 fee for embalming services and TDCJ must receive the receipt prior to delivery. *If no relative, bona fide friend, or the Anatomical Board requests the body, TDCJ shall cause the body to be \\"decently buried\\" with the embalming fee to be paid by the county in which the indictment resulting in the conviction occurred. The TDCJ keeps an online record of all of its executions, including race, age, county of origin, and last words.

Most executed prisoners are claimed by their families. While most prisoner funerals at Byrd Cemetery are held on Thursdays, in order to allow families of executed prisoners to make a single trip to Huntsville instead of two separate trips, the burial of an executed prisoner not claimed by the family is usually done the day after his or her execution. ==Opposition== The Texas Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty, a 501(c)(3) grassroots membership organization was founded in 1998. TCADP has members across the state of Texas working to educate their local communities on the problems of the Texas death penalty. TCADP hosts multiple education and training opportunities each year around the state including releasing an annual report on December 7 and a day-long annual conference which includes workshops, panel discussions, networking and awards. The conference is held in Austin during legislative years and in other Texas Cities in non-legislative years (2012: San Antonio). TCADP opened a state office in Austin in 2004 with a paid program coordinator and hired an executive director in 2008. TCADP is affiliated with the National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty. Protesters gather at the front gate of the Texas Governor's Mansion during the \\"6th Annual March to Stop Executions The March to Abolish the Death Penalty is the current name of an event organized each October since 2000 by several Texas anti-death penalty organizations, including Texas Moratorium Network, the Austin chapter of the Campaign to End the Death Penalty, the Texas Death Penalty Abolition Movement and Texas Students Against the Death Penalty. Anti- Death Penalty Alternative Spring Break is an annual event started by Texas Moratorium Network in 2004 and now co-organized by Texas Students Against the Death Penalty. It serves as a training ground for students who oppose the death penalty. The Death Row Inner-Communalist Vanguard Engagement (D.R.I.V.E.) consists of several male death row inmates from the Polunsky Unit. Through a variety of non-violent strategies, they have begun launching protests against the perceived bad conditions at Polunsky, in particular, and capital punishment, in general. They actively seek to consistently voice complaints to the administration, to organize grievance filing to address problems. They occupy day rooms, non-violently refuse to evacuate their cells or initiate sit-ins in visiting rooms, hallways, pod runs and recreation yards when there is the perception of an act of abuse of authority by guards (verbal abuse; physical abuse; meals/recreations or showers being wrongly denied; unsanitary day rooms and showers being allowed to persist; medical being denied; paper work being denied; refusing to contact higher rank to address the problems and complaints) and when alleged retaliation (thefts, denials, destruction of property; food restrictions; wrongful denials of visits; abuse of inmates) is carried out in response to their grievances. In 2016, Pfizer and other drug manufacturers banned the use of their products for lethal injections. Texas and other states were reported to be finding it difficult to obtain supplies of drugs for executions. ==Alleged execution of innocent persons== ===Cameron Todd Willingham=== One notable case involves Cameron Todd Willingham, who was executed by lethal injection on February 17, 2004 for murdering his three daughters in 1991 by arson, but where a 2009 article in The New Yorker, and subsequent findings, have cast doubt on the evidence used in his conviction. In 2009, a report conducted by Dr. Craig Beyler, hired by the Texas Forensic Science Commission to review the case, found that \\"a finding of arson could not be sustained\\". Beyler said that key testimony from a fire marshal at Willingham's trial was \\"hardly consistent with a scientific mind-set and is more characteristic of mystics or psychics”.Full Text of Report on Analysis of Arson Fire Investigation in Todd Willingham Case  Texas Moratorium Network (August 2009) Governor Rick Perry expressed skepticism of Beyler's findings. He stated that court records showed evidence of Willingham’s guilt in charges that he intentionally killed his daughters in the fire. Perry is quoted in the report as stating of Willingham, \\"I’m familiar with the latter-day supposed experts on the arson side of it,\\" and Perry said that court records provide \\"clear and compelling, overwhelming evidence that he was in fact the murderer of his children.\\" The Corsicana Fire Department also released a 19-page rebuttal of Beyler's report, stating that the report overlooked several key points that would show Willingham to be guilty.Jacobs, Janet (October 4, 2009), \\"City report on arson probe\\", Corsicana Daily Sun On July 23, 2010, the Texas Forensic Science Commission released a report saying that the conviction was based on \\"flawed science\\", but that there is no indication that the arson authorities were negligent or committed willful misconduct.Turner, Allan. \\"\\"Flawed science\\" helped lead to Texas man's execution.\\" Houston Chronicle. July 23, 2010. Retrieved on July 23, 2010. ===Carlos DeLuna=== Carlos DeLuna was convicted of murder and executed in 1989 for the killing of a 24-year-old gas station attendant on the evening of February 4, 1983. Since DeLuna's execution by lethal injection, doubts have been raised about the conviction and the question of his guilt. An investigation published by the Columbia Human Rights Law Review in May 2012 has strengthened these claims of innocence by detailing a large amount of evidence suggesting the actual murderer was Carlos Hernandez, a similar- looking man who lived in a nearby neighborhood. ===Frances Newton=== Frances Newton was executed in 2005 despite much doubt about her guilt, and much confusion over the actual weapon used in the murder(s) for which she was sentenced to death. ===Johnny Frank Garrett=== Johnny Frank Garrett was executed in 1992 for killing 76-year-old nun Tadea Benz in Amarillo in 1981. In 2004, after DNA-analyses, Leoncio Perez Rueda was found to be the murderer of Narnie Box Bryson, who was killed four months before Sister Benz. After being confronted, the murderer confessed to killing Bryson. Rueda is also believed to have been the real murderer of Sister Benz. ==Execution of Mexican nationals== Five Mexican nationals have been recently executed in Texas – José Medellín in 2008, Humberto Leal García in 2011, Édgar Tamayo Árias in 2014, Rubén Cárdenas Ramírez in 2017, and Roberto Moreno Ramos in 2018. (Prior to Medellin v. Texas, four Mexican nationals were executed by Texas, who were Ramón Montoya, Irineo Montoya, Miguel Flores, and Javier Suárez Medina, in 1993, 1997, 2000 and 2001 respectively.) At the time of their arrests in the early 1990s, neither had been informed of their rights as Mexican nationals to have the Mexican consulate informed of the charges and provide legal assistance. A 2004 ruling by the International Court of Justice concluded that the U.S. had violated the rights of 51 Mexican nationals, including Medellín and García, under the terms of a treaty the U.S. had signed. In response to the ruling, the Bush administration issued an instruction that states comply, but the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that it had exceeded its authority. The Supreme Court also ruled in Medellin v. Texas that the treaty was not binding on states until Congress enacted statutes to implement it, and in Leal Garcia v. Texas declined to place a stay on the executions in order to allow Congress additional time to enact such a statute. A 2008 ruling by the International Court of Justice asked the United States to place a stay on the executions, but Texas officials stated that they were not bound by international law. García supporters complained about the use of bite mark analysis and luminol in determining his guilt. However, García accepted responsibility for the crimes and apologized before his execution. Regarding the García execution, Texas Governor Rick Perry stated that \\"If you commit the most heinous of crimes in Texas, you can expect to face the ultimate penalty under our laws.\\" ==See also== *Capital punishment in the United States *Lists of people executed in Texas *List of death row inmates in Texas *Michael Graczyk, former Houston-based reporter for the Associated Press (now retired but working on a freelance basis), who has witnessed over 400 executions in Texas as the AP's designated representative *Crime in Texas *Law of Texas ==Further reading== *Harnsberger, R.

He won the Latvian Chess Championship in 1981.Championship of Latvia- Riga 1981 - Standings His promising chess career was interrupted when he refused to join the Soviet Army. For several years he went undercover but in 1986 he was sentenced to two years in prison. After one year he received an amnesty after the meeting of Presidents Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev. Following his release he moved from Riga to Warsaw where he won two Polish Chess Championships. He played for Poland in the Chess Olympiads of 1990 and 1992. He later resided in the United States, whereupon he became one of the most active players on the tournament circuit, constantly flying around the world. Several times he won the annual $10,000 first prize for Grand Prix chess tournaments in the United States. Wojtkiewicz played in the FIDE World Chess Championship 2004. In his final months, he tied for first at the 2006 World Open in Philadelphia and won the 2006 National Open in Las Vegas. He died on the evening of 14 July 2006 from a perforated intestine and massive bleeding. Wojtkiewicz's strategies have been investigated in the online series \\"How Wojo Won\\" by chess master Jonathan Hilton. The six-part series began in December 2006 and continued until April 2008.

It was established in 1999 by Prince Abubakar Audu, the former governor of the state. At the time of its establishment, it was known as Kogi State University, It was later named Prince Abubakar Audu University (PAAU) in 2002, after the then sitting governor of Kogi State, who heralded its establishment, and later renamed Kogi State University (KSU) in 2003 and subsequently renamed as Prince Abubakar Audu University in 2020 by Governor Alhaji Yahaya Adoza Bello in respect of late Abubakar Audu. Professor S.K. Okwute (Professor of Chemistry) was the pioneer Vice Chancellor (2000-2005) and currently back to University of Abuja. Professor F.S. Idachaba (OFR), Professor of Agric-Economics, took over between 2005 and 2008 and then retired to work in his foundation (F.S. Idachaba Foundation for Research and Scholarship) before his death. Professor I. Isah (Professor of Chemical Pathology), from Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, took over in October 2008. The incumbent Vice Chancellor is Professor Marietu Tenuche. In 2017 the Academic Staff Union of University (ASUU) KSU chapter was locked in an industrial crisis with the state government over non payment of salaries for several months. The state government accused the lecturers of politicising the industrial dispute and ordered their immediate return to class room or would their positions declared vacant for fresh applications. After several days of refusal to return to the class, Governor Bello who is Visitor to the school announced the proscription of ASUU and its withdrawal from the national ASUU. == Faculties (Colleges) == Kogi State University has 10 faculties === Social Sciences === * Mass Communications * Economics * Political Science * Sociology * Geography and Planning === Management Science === *Accounting * Banking and Finance * Public Administration *Business Administration Kogi State University commenced academic activities in April, 2000 with six faculties: Faculties of Agriculture, Arts and Humanities, Law, Management Sciences, Natural Sciences and Social Sciences. The university added the establishment of Faculty of Medicine with extensive office and laboratory complexes. The Centre for Pre-Degree and Diploma Studies was established under the present University administration to run diploma and pre-degree programmes. Students of the pre-degree programme could gain admission into the degree programme if they are successful in the internal exams and need not write the Post-UTME exams. All the faculties and centre for Remedial Studies and Diploma are in one place because the university is planned to be a city of its own. There are no satellite campuses. However there are clamours that the university be decentralised by moving some of its faculties especially College of Medicine to either western or Central part of the state. The university offers many courses on such topics as medicine, law, microbiology, biochemistry, geology (combined engineering and geosciences), physics, mathematics, computer sciences, public administration, human kinetics, industrial chemistry, statistics, business administration, accounting, banking and finance, theatre arts, food, nutrition and home sciences, agricultural engineering, crop production, animal production, soil science, food science and technology, fishery and forestry, Islamic studies, religion and philosophy, English, history and international studies, sociology, mass communication, economics, and chemistry. 98% of the courses offered in the university are accredited by the Nigeria University Commission (NUC). Although not very popular, the university is one of the best in Africa, with some of its departments being ranked by Nigerian professional and academic bodies as the best in Nigeria. Some few years ago, the Faculty of law was pronounced as the best in Nigeria, and has remained among the best in subsequent years. Also the department of Geology has been rated as one of the best in Africa, alongside Obafemi Awolowo University, and the University of Ibadan. Presently, it hosts a library which is home to a large collection of expensive specialized books, materials, and a Geologic station, both contributed by Shell Petroleum Development Company as an appreciation of the department's exceptionally-strong intellectual capacity development attitude. The university also boasts facilities which according to undisclosed sources, are accessible to students for academic research, a privilege very uncommon among other Nigerian universities. Notable is the University's E-library; a large heavily-equipped structure which is stand-alone and separate from the school's main library. Sources have it that there a few other Nigerian universities such as Covenant University (private university) that boast a stand-alone E-library. Despite inadequate funding which is the major challenge of state owned universities compared to federal universities, KSU has been named the university with the best implementation of resources for development by the Knowledge for Impact Foundation. == Students == The Institution started with a student population of about 700 in 2000, but which as at 2009/2010 admission exercise has grown to about 16,000, and now stands at about 50,000 in 2016. It is also known as one of the fairest universities in its admission exercise, admitting students strictly by merit, and supplementarily by near- merit. It has been ranked as Nigeria's fastest developing university, and one of such, in Africa. The university like many others has a functional Student Union Government (SUG). In 2014 however the SUG was suspended due to violence during the elections and was later reinstated in 2016 (it was run by an interim government until then). The next election was a lot more successful and produced Phillip Omepa as the president and Suleiman, Farouq Omale as the Director of Welfare. In 2018 Governor Yahaya Bello was accused of plotting to impose hand picked candidates as the leaders of the students union. Although not as popular as its federal counterparts like the University of Lagos, Obafemi Awolowo University, and Ahmadu Bello University, Kogi State University has been named by many multinational Corporate bodies as one of Africa's BEST universities based on the exceptional intellectual pedigree of its employed graduates. As at January 2017, the University officially dismembered itself from the Academic Staff Union of Universities: the umbrella body for academic staff members of Nigerian universities. As such, academic programmes have become stable and fast, without the incessant strike actions characteristic of ASUU-member universities.

It was previously regarded as member of the Australo-Pacific honeyeaters (family Meliphagidae). This bird was endemic to the island of Kauai. It was common in the subtropical forests of the island until the early twentieth century, when its decline began. Its song was last heard in 1987, and it is now probably extinct. The causes of its extinction include the introduction of the Polynesian rat, the domestic pig, and mosquitoes, as well as habitat destruction. == Etymology == The native Hawaiians named the bird ōō āā, from the Hawaiian word ōō, an onomatopoeic descriptor from the sound of their call, and āā, meaning dwarf. ==Description== Adult and juvenile Moho braccatus This bird was among the smallest of the Hawaiian 'o'os, if not the smallest species, at just over in length. The head, wings, and tail were black. The rest of the upperparts were slaty brown, becoming rufous on the rump and flanks. The throat and breast was black with white barring, which was particularly prominent in females. The central tail feathers were long, and there was a small tuft of gray feathers under the base of the wing. While the beak and legs were black, the leg feathers were a rich golden yellow. It was the only ‘ō’ō known to have eyes with yellow irises. Like other honeyeaters it had a sharp, slightly curved bill for sampling nectar. Its favored nectar sources were Lobelia species and the ohia lehua tree. This species was additionally observed foraging in lapalapa trees. It also ate small invertebrates and fruit. The Kauai ōō was very vocal, making hollow, erratic, flute-like calls. Both the males and females were known to sing. ==Extinction== Specimen, Bishop Museum, Honolulu The bird was a cavity nester in the thickly forested canyons of Kauai. Many of its relatives have also become extinct, such as the Hawaii ōō, Bishop's ōō, and Oahu ōō. Little is known about these extinct birds. The species may have become extinct from a large range of problems, including mosquito-transmitted diseases, which caused the species to retreat to higher ground, ultimately retreating to high- altitude montane forests in the Alaka'i Wilderness Preserve. Higher elevation forests lack tree cavities, so few, if any, nests could be made. In the 1970s the only known footage of the bird was filmed by John L. Sincock on Super 8 film and several song recordings were made as well (with Harold Douglas Pratt, Jr. being one of the people involved in recording the songs). The final blow was two hurricanes coming within ten years of each other. They destroyed many of the old trees with cavities, and prohibited tree growth when the second one arrived, causing the species to disappear. The bird was last sighted in 1985, and the last sound recording was made in 1987 by David Boynton. It is still believed by some that the species may survive undetected, as the species had already been proclaimed extinct twice: once in the 1940s (later rediscovered in 1950) and again from the late 1950s to the early 1970s, being rediscovered by the wildlife biologist John Sincock. However, it has a loud and distinctive call, and intensive surveys have failed to find any since 1987. ==References== ==Further reading== * .

The school building is two stories high and features eight wings of classrooms. The logo for all Vets \\"Hurricane\\" teams was a reverse-rotating hurricane symbol. School colors were blue, gold, and white. The school held grades 912 until 2016, when it closed due to declining enrollment and the building was converted to a junior high school. The school had an enrollment of over one thousand students, and its principal when it was converted was Gerald Habershaw. The school was opened in 1956 as a response to a booming Warwick population -- the previous high schools (which came to be known as Samuel Gorton Junior High and Aldrich Junior High and also Lockwood Junior High which has been converted to condos) were too small for the large number of incoming students. In the late 1960s, the 900 wing extension was added to the school. Two additional high schools were constructed to answer Warwick's population increase, Pilgrim High School in 1962 and Toll Gate High School in 1972. == Athletics == In 2000, a swim team was created. The initiators of this were Katherine McLaughlin and Kristen Carpenter-Azeveto, who swam inter- murally with Pilgrim since their sophomore year. They were co-captains for their Senior year in the 2000 and 2001 season. The girls' field hockey team was the 2005 division and state champions. Additionally, the boys' outdoor track team were city champions for thirteen straight years and division B champions for four years. The freshman football team reached the championship game in two consecutive years (2004–05 & 2005–06) but lost both games to crosstown rivals Pilgrim High School and William E. Tolman High School of Pawtucket. The Warwick Vets Cheerleading program was very active until 2016. The Varsity team took 1st place in the RI State competition from 1999–2007. In 2007, the boys basketball team had its first thousand-point scorer in several years. In 2008, the girls soccer team made it to the Division 1 state semi- finals. In 2010, the basketball team won their first game in over 23 years. Thanks to the leading scorer, Anita Waxen, they got their first basketball championship. In 2011, the school joined in the 2nd phase of RI Unified Basketball, a collaboration with RI Special Olympics and the RI Interscholastic League. This program is a national model that promotes a Varsity level co-ed team to have students with disabilities play with non- disabled peers on the same team. In their first regular season, the team was undefeated. They went on to the playoffs as a Division I team and were defeated in the final championship round by 1 point at the buzzer and placed 2nd in the State out of 18 teams. == Other activities == Until its conversion as a junior high school, the school featured active chapters of FBLA, DECA, Student Council, Math League, Academic Decathlon, SADD (Students Against Destructive Decisions), STAND: A Student Anti-Genocide Coalition, and other clubs.

His nickname is Testa di Ferro, Testaferrata, or Capodiferro in Italian and Capi(te)ferreus in Latin. (died March 981) was the Prince of Benevento and Capua from 943 (or 944) until his death. He was made Duke of Spoleto and Camerino in 967 and succeeded as Prince of Salerno in 977 or 978. He was an important nobleman in the fight with the Byzantines and Saracens for control of the Mezzogiorno in the centuries after the collapse of Lombard and Carolingian authority on the Italian Peninsula. He established himself over almost the whole of the southern half of Italia before his death in March 981. His mother was Yvantia. He co-reigned with his father, Landulf II, from 943, when his grandfather Landulf I died, and with his brother Landulf III from 959. Sometime about 955, Pope John XII led an army of Romans, Tuscans, and Spoletans against Landulf II and Pandulf, but Gisulf I of Salerno came to their rescue and no battle was given. The pope and Gisulf made a treaty at Terracina. Gisulf and Pandulf had a strong alliance after that. In 961, Landulf II died and Pandulf and his brother became sole princes, though the elder Pandulf was by far the more domineering. The Chronicum Salernitanum affirms the co-regency, however, and the principle of the indivisibility of the united Capua-Benevento as declared by Atenulf I in 900, when it says Beneventanorum principatum eius filii Pandolfum et Landulfum bifarie regebant . . . communi indivisoque iure, that is \\"the Beneventan principality was reigned in jointly by Pandulf and Landulf under indivisible common jurisdiction.\\" However, this system eventually collapsed and Pandulf ruled in Capua while Landulf ruled in Benevento. The Chronicum says Pandulf tenuit principatum una cum suo germanus annos octo, that is, \\"held the principality solely with his brother for eight years.\\" Late in 965, a rebellion in Rome overthrew Pope John XIII, who was arrested and carted off to imprisonment in Campania. Whether he escaped or was released, he arrived in Capua not much later, seeking the protection of Pandulf, who gladly gave it. In return, and for the favour of the citizens, he erected Capua into an archdiocese and gave Pandulf's brother John the pallium. After ten months of exile, another revolt in Rome gave opportunity for return and Pandulf sent the pope back with a Capuan escort. In 967, the Emperor Otto I came down to Rome and granted Pandulf the vacant Duchy of Spoleto of Camerino and charged him with prosecuting the war against the Byzantine Empire. Pandulf and Landulf introduced Prince Gisulf of Salerno to the emperor at this time. They then took part in the imperial campaign of 968, but Landulf retired in illness and died at Benevento leaving two sons: Pandulf and Landulf. Even though Pandulf was with the emperor on the border of Calabria when news of Landulf's death reached him, he quickly returned to Benevento and associated with him his own eldest son Landulf, who was crowned prince in the church of Sancta Sophia, before rejoining the imperial campaign. In that year, Otto left the siege of Bari in the charge of Pandulf, but the Lombard was captured in the Battle of Bovino (969) by the Byzantines and jailed in Constantinople. In 970, during his absence, the Byzantines besieged Capua and Marinus II of Naples ravaged the countryside. He was released later in the deal in which the Byzantine emperor John Tzimisces gave Theophanu in marriage to Otto's son Otto II. During his absence, the great principality had been administered by Landulf I, Archbishop of Benevento, and the young Landulf, with help from his mother, Pandulf's wife, Aloara. Benevento had been made an archdiocese in 969. In the 960s, Byzantium had been trying to supplant German influence in Salerno and to this end may have engineered the rebellion which temporarily unseated John XIII, a pro-German pope. Prince Gisulf of Salerno, however, was allied both to the Greeks and to his Lombard neighbour Pandulf, whom he had rescued some years before and who was, in fact, staunchly pro-German and anti-Greek. When Gisulf was deposed and removed from office by Pandulf's cousin, Landulf of Conza, in 973, Pandulf restored Gisulf as his vassal. When Gisulf died childless in 977 or 978, Pandulf succeeded in Salerno as per their prior agreement. The policy of the Greeks was a thorough failure and Pandulf (and his Germans) was the winner in southern Italy. He had united all three of the Lombard principalities -- Benevento, Capua, and Salerno -- and had even gained Spoleto and Camerino. He ruled a large bloc of territories that stretched as far north as Tuscany and as far south as the Gulf of Taranto.\\"from Ancona to the fringes of Calabria\\" in Wickham, 156. In 978, Pandulf confirmed that the Sanctuary of Monte Sant'Angelo sul Gargano belonged the archbishopric of Benevento. This act was witnessed by two Byzantine officials.Loud, 63. Pandulf's lands were partitioned among his sons, who fought endlessly over the inheritance. His son Landulf IV received Capua and Benevento and Pandulf II received Salerno. Otto II came down to Rome in 981, however, and Spoleto was given to Thrasimund IV, Duke of Camerino. Then, Pandulf's nephew Pandulf was given Benevento in a partition of Landulf's territory, in which Landulf kept Capua. Finally, Manso I of Amalfi dispossessed the younger Pandulf of Salerno and was confirmed by the Emperor. Pandulf had several other sons: Landenulf, who succeeded Landulf IV in Capua; Laidulf, who succeeded Landenulf; and Atenulf, who died at the Battle of Stilo on 13 July 982. ==Notes== ==References== *Leyser, Karl.

McCormack started his career with Scottish Premier League club Rangers in 2002, where he made few appearances and was loaned to English League One side Doncaster Rovers in January 2006. At the end of the season he was released by Rangers and joined fellow SPL side Motherwell. Although his first season was disrupted by a long illness, he became a regular player and scorer in his second season there. In 2008 McCormack joined Championship club Cardiff City upon the expiry of his contract. In 2010, he moved to Leeds United for a fee of around £350,000, eventually becoming their captain. In the 2013–14 season, he was the Championship top scorer with 28 goals, prompting a transfer to Fulham in July 2014 for an undisclosed fee. He scored 42 goals in 100 competitive appearances over two years at Fulham, and was signed by Aston Villa for a £12 million fee. He fell out of favour with Villa manager Steve Bruce and was loaned to Nottingham Forest, Melbourne City, Central Coast Mariners and Motherwell before being released in 2019. McCormack played ten times for Scotland U21s, scoring three goals, and he was also capped once for the Scotland B team. He made his full international debut for Scotland in 2008 and has been capped 13 times overall, scoring twice. ==Club career== ===Rangers=== Born in Glasgow, McCormack started his career at Rangers joining the club on 4 June 2002. He made his first appearance on 1 May 2004 against future club Motherwell at the age of 17, coming on in place of Mikel Arteta in the 61st minute of a 4–0 win at Ibrox. Fifteen days later, McCormack scored his first goal for the club in the final match of the 2003–04 season against Dunfermline Athletic at East End Park. He started the game and won a penalty when fouled by Barry Nicholson, which he converted himself in a 3–2 win. On 23 November 2005, he made his European debut away to FC Porto in the UEFA Champions League group stage, replacing Francis Jeffers with 14 minutes remaining. Seven minutes later, with the Gers' first shot on target, he equalised in a 1–1 draw. McCormack's opportunities were limited in a Rangers side when Dado Pršo and Nacho Novo returned from injury and the club signed Kris Boyd from Kilmarnock in January 2006. On 21 January, he was sent out on loan to English League One club Doncaster Rovers in order to gain first team experience. He scored five times for Doncaster. ===Motherwell=== At the start of the 2006–07 season, McCormack was told he did not feature in new Rangers manager Paul Le Guen's plans and was released. On 11 July 2006, he signed a two-year deal at Motherwell. His new manager Maurice Malpas, who had worked with him at Scotland under-21, said that he had seen him improve by playing regularly at Doncaster. McCormack made his Well debut on 30 July as the team began the SPL season with a 2–1 home loss to Rangers, in which he assisted their goal by Phil O'Donnell. His first season at Fir Park was disrupted by illness that caused an overactive thyroid gland and ruled him out from September until February 2007. On 28 February, he scored his first goal for the team, a consolation in a 2–1 home loss to First Division team St Johnstone in the quarter-finals of the Scottish Cup. His only league goals of the campaign came on 12 May, one in each half of a 3–2 home loss to St Mirren. In 2007–08, McCormack became a fixture in the Motherwell first team, where he found himself better suited to playing in a 4–3–3 formation, receiving the October 2007 Young Player of the Month award. The season also saw an improvement in his goal tally as he scored a total of 11 goals, although he reached this mark on 16 February with a brace against Gretna and suffered a goal drought in the remaining 14 games of the season. ===Cardiff City=== McCormack playing for Cardiff City in 2010 In January 2008, McCormack was linked with a move to Premier League sides Wigan Athletic, even coming as close as having a contract ready to be signed with the club, and Middlesbrough but no deal was agreed and he eventually signed for Championship side Cardiff City on 28 June on a free transfer, although the clubs would later agree on a compensation fee of £120,000. On his arrival, McCormack stated that one of the biggest reasons that persuaded him to sign for the club, alongside the chance to play first-team football and the group of Scottish players on the club's books, was the presence of his idol Robbie Fowler, only for the former England international to leave the club soon after. McCormack made his league debut on the opening day of the season in a 2–1 victory over Southampton and went on to score his first competitive goal for Cardiff in a 1–1 draw against Doncaster the following week. He finished the season as the club's top scorer with 23 goals in all competitions and joint second place Championship top scorer. His final goals of the season in a 3–1 win over Burnley were the last goals scored at Ninian Park by a Cardiff player in a competitive match. On 23 July 2009 it was reported McCormack handed in a transfer request. This was denied by his agent who claimed that there is a 'gentleman's agreement' in his contract that stipulates that he can speak to any Premier League club who bid for his services. Amidst interest from Premier League clubs, on 8 August he was involved in three goals of a 4–0 win over Scunthorpe United in the first match at the Cardiff City Stadium. ===Leeds United=== On 24 August 2010, Cardiff agreed a fee with Leeds United over a possible transfer, and three days later he signed a three-year contract for an undisclosed fee. He made his Leeds debut on 28 August as a 70th-minute substitute in a 1–0 win over Watford, and his first start in a 0–0 draw with Doncaster Rovers on 17 September. On 30 April 2011, he scored his first goal for Leeds in a 1–0 win over Burnley, and was named man of the match. His only other goal of the campaign was in Leeds' 2–1 win over champions Queens Park Rangers in the final game of the season. McCormack playing for Leeds United in 2012 With two goals in a 3–3 draw against Brighton & Hove Albion on 23 September 2011, including an injury-time equaliser, McCormack became the first Leeds player in over 50 years to score in six consecutive league games. He was nominated for the Championship Player of the Month Award for September, which went to Middlesbrough's Matthew Bates. He was linked with a move to Wolves during November, but manager Simon Grayson stated that he did not want to sell McCormack. During December, he was linked with moves to Premier League clubs Blackburn Rovers and Wolves again. In April 2012, Leeds were in negotiations with McCormack over extending his current deal. He finished the season as the club's top scorer. On 28 April, after he scored 19 goals in all competitions for Leeds during the 2011–12 season won the Yorkshire Evening Post Player of the Year Award for Leeds United. On 17 August 2012, he signed a new three-year deal with the club. In the first few minutes of the match against his former club Cardiff City, McCormack was tackled by Jordon Mutch and picked up a serious ankle injury as a result of the tackle. He underwent surgery on the damaged ankle and was expected to be out until the new year, but returned to action on 18 November. McCormack scored the winning goal for Leeds in a 2–1 FA Cup victory against Tottenham Hotspur on 27 January 2013. At the club's end- of-season awards, this won the club's Goal of the Season award. On 3 August, Leeds confirmed they had rejected a joint bid from Blackpool for McCormack and Aidy White. Later in the month he entered negotiations for a new contract, ending the uncertainty about the player's future after three separate bids by Middlesbrough in the region of £1.8 million. On 30 August, after Leeds had rejected those bids, McCormack signed a new four-year deal with the club. McCormack became the first Leeds player to score four times in a league match since Brian Deane in 2004, and the first to do so in an away match for 87 years, in a 4–2 victory over Charlton Athletic on 9 November 2013 which put him to the top of the Championship leading scorers of the 2013–14 season with 11 goals. On 16 January 2014, McCormack was named club captain after Rodolph Austin stepped down from the role. In January 2014, Leeds rejected bids for McCormack from West Ham United and then on transfer deadline day from Cardiff. With rumours of interest also from Sunderland on deadline day, McCormack released a statement via Sky Sports News that he pledged his future to Leeds and also his support of manager Brian McDermott, who was sacked only 30 minutes later. The next day, McCormack scored a hat-trick in a 5–1 victory against local rivals Huddersfield Town, taking his tally to 22 goals for the season. McCormack finished the 2013–14 season scoring 29 goals in all competitions for Leeds, and was second to Danny Ings as Championship Player of the Year. He was named in the Championship PFA Team of the Year, and also named the LUDO Player of the Year and the LUSC Player of the Year, as well as the Yorkshire Evening Post Player of the Year. At the club's annual awards ceremony, McCormack won the Fans Player of the Year award, Players Player of the Year award and also the Goal of the Season Award for his strike against Sheffield Wednesday. On 5 June, Leeds owner Massimo Cellino said he had rejected a substantial offer for McCormack from Newcastle United, which that club denied. On 30 June, McCormack was left out of Leeds' pre-season training camp in Italy. On 2 July, BBC Sport reported that McCormack had handed in a transfer request. Leeds commented on his future the following day, reiterating that they wanted the player to remain at the club and that the club 'no longer needs to sell their best players in order to run the club successfully'. ===Fulham=== McCormack playing for Fulham in 2014 McCormack signed for newly relegated Championship team Fulham on 8 July 2014. He was transferred for an £11 million fee, including add-ons, and signed a four-year contract with the option of a fifth. He made his debut on 9 August as Fulham began the season with a 2–1 loss at Ipswich, after which manager Felix Magath criticised his fitness level. Fifteen days later he scored his first goal for his new team, the only one in a League Cup second round victory at West London rivals Brentford. On 17 September, he opened his league account for the Whites with a brace in a 5–3 loss at Nottingham Forest. McCormack was sent off for two yellow cards in a 3–3 draw at Wigan Athletic on 1 November. On 21 January 2015, McCormack scored a hat-trick in the first 32 minutes of a 3–2 win over Forest at Craven Cottage. At the start of April, he scored in four consecutive games, and on the 25th he scored another treble in a 4–3 home win over Middlesbrough. He received the majority of the fans' votes for Fulham's Player of the Season. McCormack retained the club's award the following season, with nearly three-quarters of the votes cast, and was also included in the Championship PFA Team of the Year and beaten only by top scorer Andre Gray as the league's Player of the Season. He scored 23 times over the season in addition to nine assists. ===Aston Villa and loans=== McCormack joined Aston Villa, under Roberto di Matteo, on 4 August 2016 for £12 million on a four- year deal. Three days later, he was included in Villa's starting lineup for their 2016–17 Championship opening fixture away to Sheffield Wednesday, a 1–0 loss. He scored his first goal in a 1–1 draw with Huddersfield Town at Villa Park on 16 August. On 21 January 2017, Villa manager Steve Bruce revealed that McCormack had been dropped from the first team squad for \\"continually missing training\\", adding that \\"he is nowhere near fit enough to play and be involved\\". Twelve days later, he joined fellow Championship team Nottingham Forest on loan until the end of the season. After making the loan move, McCormack admitted that he had once missed training when he had been trapped in his home by a faulty electronic gate. He scored on his debut for Forest in a 5–1 loss at Norwich City on 11 February. McCormack made himself unavailable for \\"personal issues\\" in March, as Forest struggled against relegation. McCormack made only two EFL Cup substitute appearances in the early part of the 2017–18 season after returning to Villa. On 29 September 2017, he signed for A-League club Melbourne City on loan until January 2018. He made his debut in the season opener on 6 October, starting as his team defeated Brisbane Roar 2–0 at the Melbourne Rectangular Stadium. Fifteen days later, he scored his first goal, a free kick to win a home game against the Wellington Phoenix. On 28 October, he scored both goals of a 2–0 win at Adelaide United. After the game, he told the media that he was pleased to be in scoring form again. On 22 November, it was reported that McCormack had been dropped from the Melbourne City squad for being \\"exceptionally late to training\\". After returning to Villa, McCormack was still frozen out of the team due to his disputes with Bruce. In May 2018, it was revealed that his annual salary of £2.3 million would have a bonus £1 million added if Villa were promoted, despite him not playing a league match for them that season. On 20 September 2018, McCormack signed a one-year loan deal with A-League club Central Coast Mariners FC. He played alongside the Olympic sprinting champion Usain Bolt for Central Coast, and assisted Bolt's first goal in an official football match. On 5 January 2019, McCormack was recalled by Aston Villa; he made just five appearances for the Mariners, scoring once. McCormack was then loaned to Motherwell for the rest of the 2018–19 season, returning to the club after a decade elsewhere. After making four appearances for Motherwell, McCormack returned to Aston Villa in March for treatment of a calf injury that had kept him from playing for a month. Motherwell manager Stephen Robinson said in April that McCormack would not return to Motherwell. He was released by Aston Villa at the end of the 2018–19 season. ===Aldershot Town=== On 18 September 2020, McCormack signed for National League club Aldershot Town. ==International career== McCormack made his debut for the Scotland U21 in 2006. He scored his first goal for the side on 11 October 2007 against Lithuania and scored again in his next appearance, a 4–0 victory over Slovenia U21s. McCormack won 10 caps for the under-21 side. He made his debut for the senior side on 30 May 2008 when he came on as a substitute during the 3–1 defeat of Czech Republic. McCormack was called up again in March 2009 for the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifiers against Netherlands and Iceland. He started both matches, scoring his first goal for Scotland in a 2–1 win over Iceland on 1 April 2009. Scotland manager Craig Levein received several complaints for not including the in-form McCormack in his Scotland squad in their final two European Championship qualifiers. McCormack received a call up to the Scotland squad in August 2012, and scored his second international goal in a 3–1 win over Australia. McCormack received a call-up to Gordon Strachan's first Scotland squad for the friendly against Estonia in February 2013 but pulled out of the squad after suffering an illness. On 24 August, after scoring 4 goals in his first 5 games for Leeds during the 2013–14 season, McCormack's form earned him a recall to Gordon Strachan's Scotland squad for World Cup qualifiers against Belgium and Macedonia. ==Personal life== On 27 October 2009, McCormack was arrested in Cardiff Bay on a drink-driving charge after crashing his Range Rover into metal railings in the early hours of the morning. On 23 November, he pleaded guilty to the charge and was banned from driving for 17 months and fined £15,500. In July 2013 McCormack was handed a £200 fine, ordered to pay £883.25 in costs and a £20 victim surcharge at a hearing at Leeds Magistrates' Court, for the offense of flytipping. McCormack married model Courtney St John in Marbella in June 2016. They have two sons together, while McCormack has an older son from another relationship. ==Career statistics== ===Club=== { class=  + Appearances and goals by club, season and competition - !rowspan=2Club !rowspan=2Season !colspan=3League !colspan=2National Cup !colspan=2League Cup !colspan=2Other !colspan=2Total - !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals - rowspan=4Rangers 2003–04 Scottish Premier League2100000021 - 2004–05 Scottish Premier League1000000010 - 2005–06 Scottish Premier League81110021113 - !colspan=2Total !11!!2!!1!!1!!0!!0!!2!!1!!14!!4 - Doncaster Rovers (loan) 2005–06 League One195colspan=2—colspan=2—colspan=2—195 - rowspan=3Motherwell 2006–07 Scottish Premier League1221120colspan=2—153 - 2007–08 Scottish Premier League3683132colspan=2—4211 - !colspan=2Total !48!!10!!4!!2!!5!!2!!colspan=2—!!57!!14 - rowspan=4Cardiff City 2008–09 Championship38213131colspan=2—4423 - 2009–10 Championship344410030415 - 2010–11 Championship20colspan=2—12colspan=2—32 - !colspan=2Total !74!!25!!7!!2!!4!!3!!3!!0!!88!!30 - rowspan=5Leeds United 2010–11 Championship21200colspan=2—colspan=2—212 - 2011–12 Championship45181031colspan=2—4919 - 2012–13 Championship3254221colspan=2—388 - 2013–14 Championship46281031colspan=2—5029 - !colspan=2Total !144!!53!!6!!2!!8!!3!!colspan=2—!!158!!58 - rowspan=3Fulham 2014–15 Championship44174131colspan=2—5119 - 2015–16 Championship45211032colspan=2—4923 - !colspan=2Total !89!!38!!5!!1!!6!!3!!colspan=2—!!100!!42 - rowspan=4Aston Villa 2016–17 Championship2031010colspan=2—223 - 2017–18 Championship000020colspan=2—20 - 2018–19 Championship000000colspan=2—00 - !colspan=2Total!!20!!3!!1030colspan=2—243 - Nottingham Forest (loan) 2016–17 Championship71colspan=2—colspan=2—colspan=2—71 - Melbourne City (loan) 2017–18 A-League1714colspan=2—colspan=2—colspan=2—1714 - Central Coast Mariners (loan) 2018–19 A-League51colspan=2—colspan=2—colspan=2—51 - Motherwell (loan) 2018–19 Scottish Premiership3010colspan=2—colspan=2—40 - !colspan=3Career total !437!!152!!25!!8!!26!!11!!5!!1!!493!!172 } ===International appearances=== { class= style=\\"text-align: center;\\" + Appearances and goals by national team and year - !National team!!Year!!Apps!!Goals - rowspan=9Scotland 200810 - 200941 - 2010colspan=2-- - 201120 - 201211 - 201320 - 201410 - 2015colspan=2-- - 201620 - !colspan=2Total!!13!!2 } ===International goals=== :As of match played 29 May 2016.

The school was founded by Royal Charter of Queen Elizabeth I in 1591 at the request of leading citizens in Wakefield (headed by Thomas Savile and his two sons) 75 in total and some of whom formed the first governing body.History of Wakefield Cathedral 16th Century The school is part of a foundation, with both QEGS Senior and Junior schools joined together, along with the nearby Wakefield Girls' High School and its Junior School, and Mulberry House, which is a nursery and pre-prep department. As of September 2010, the current headmaster of the school is David Craig, taking over Les Hallwood, who stood in as acting Headmaster during the time between the leave of the previous headmaster, Michael Gibbons, and the beginning of the next academic year. QEGS is a member of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference. Some notable former pupils include the 17th century English physician, John Radcliffe, Joseph Moxon, mathematician and hydrographer to King Charles II, Richard Henry Lee, signer of the United States Declaration of Independence, US Senator and President of the Continental Congress, Sir Francis Molyneux, 7th Baronet, Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod, Mike Harrison, former captain England national rugby union team, Mike Tindall, England Rugby Union player, member of the World Cup winning team in 2003, John Potter, Archbishop of Canterbury and the Rt Revd and Rt Hon the Lord Hope of Thornes, former Archbishop of York. ==History== ===Founding=== Queen Elizabeth Grammar School dates back to 19 November 1591 when a charter was granted to fourteen men to act as Governors of the new school. The Charter read: The original Elizabethan school building on Brook Street Five of the fourteen men designated to be governors bore the name Saville. Generations of the Saville family have played important roles in the school’s history and hence the reason why the Old Boys’ Association is called the Old Savilians’ Club.QEGS History ===Coat of arms=== The school arms came into existence soon after the school was founded and features a lion, an owl and a bible. The golden lion on a red field refers to the royal foundation; the silver owl on black is taken from the arms of the Savile family (one of the founding families) and the Bible indicates the religious side of education. The school motto – Turpe Nescire – means “It is a disgrace to be ignorant”. ===School song=== Around 1900, H. G. Abel, then the senior classics master, composed 'Floreas, Wakefieldia' and Matthew Peacock, headmaster and honorary choirmaster at the cathedral, set the words to music. It was seen as fitting that the song should be written in Latin, thereby evoking echoes of traditional scholasticism. The song is still sung today – at Founders' Day, Speech Day and at all Old Savilian Club dinners. ==Facilities== The current buildings on Northgate In 1854 QEGS moved to its present site in Northgate, Wakefield, into premises designed by the architect Richard Lane and formerly occupied by the West Riding Proprietary School. The attached Junior school for boys aged 7 to 11 was founded in 1910. A new building (Savile Building) was opened in 2005 by Ted Wragg, the famous educationalist, who taught at the school in the early 1960s. The new building provides a new 6th form centre, English department, state-of-the-art theatre and Learning Resources Centre for the pupils of QEGS. ==Sport== War memorial at Queen Elizabeth Grammar School, Wakefield The school is often noted for its sporting ability, having achieved frequent success in a number of sports. Over 83% of the school's boys represent QEGS in one sporting event or another. The most popular sport is rugby union, followed by hockey, cricket, athletics and basketball. Hockey in particular has experienced substantial growth in the school throughout the last decade, and is now close to matching rugby union's dominance internally. In 2006, 2013, 2014 and 2015 the under-15s Rugby side reached the Daily Mail Cup final, winning the 2015 competition in a tight 15-6 win over three time final rivals Warwick. In 2009 every age group won the hockey 'Yorkshire Cup' for the first time in the school's history with the under 16s going on to reach the national semi-finals, only to lose to Whitgift School. As well as plenty of sporting opportunities, the school also gives pupils the opportunity to participate in the Duke of Edinburgh's Award Scheme. ==In popular culture== *David Storey's Booker Prize winning novel Saville (1976) includes an account of the experiences of a working class boy at a Yorkshire grammar school in the 1940s. Storey, like the protagonist of Saville a miner's son, is an old boy of QEGS. *The school is mentioned in the novel Nineteen Seventy-Four by David Peace. ==Notable Old Savilians== ===Academia=== * T.D.

He was born in Quebec City around 1796 and worked as a clerk in the medical department of the British army during the War of 1812. He studied medicine in the United States and returned to York in 1824 to practice medicine in Upper Canada. He served in various capacities during the 1832 and 1834 cholera outbreaks and co-founded the York Dispensary. In 1834 he was elected to the 12th Parliament of Upper Canada representing the 3rd riding of York County as part of William Lyon Mackenzie's reform movement. That same year he was elected as an alderman to the Toronto City Council and reelected the subsequent two years. In 1836, he served a term as mayor of Toronto. Morrison had been an early supporter of the reform movement in Upper Canada and participated in meetings to encourage political change. However, he repeatedly spoke against armed rebellion and encouraged Mackenzie to continue obtaining support for his reform. During the Upper Canada Rebellion he chose not to participate and instead stayed in his home. Nevertheless, he was arrested and charged with treason for planning and executing the rebellion and found not guilty at a subsequent trial. Fearing additional charges, Morrison fled to the United States and resumed practicing medicine. When amnesty was granted to participants of the rebellion in 1843 he returned to Toronto to continue his medical practice and serve on various boards of medicine. ==Early life== Thomas David Morrison was born circa 1796 in Quebec City. His father was William Morrison. He came to York, Ontario at some point before 1816. ==Career pre-rebellion== ===Clerk=== During the War of 1812 Morrison worked with the British army as a clerk of acquisitions in the medical department. In 1816 he was hired as a clerk in York for the office of the surveyor-general. He was fired from the position in 1822 for \\"uttering languages\\" and “opinions very unbecoming a person employed in one of His Majesty’s public offices.” ===Medical career pre-rebellion=== After his dismissal, Morrison was educated in the field of medicine in the United States. He returned to York and on June 5, 1824 he was licenced to practice medicine in “Physic, Surgery and Midwifery.” Morrison opened his practice in York but also travelled north into the country to care for people. He was part of the ad hoc board of health in York during the 1832 cholera outbreak and worked to combat a larger outbreak in 1834. In 1832 he administered the York Dispensary with William Warren Baldwin and John E. Tims, but it closed a year later due to a lack of funding. In 1836 he was appointed to the Medical Board of Upper Canada by the Lieutenant-Governor. He also served as a school board trustee and as a trustee for the York General Burying Ground. ===Political career=== In 1828 Morrison ran for the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada for the third riding in the town of York. He ran on a reform platform supported by William Lyon Mackenzie which opposed the firing of Judge John Walpole Willis by Lieutenant Governor Peregrine Maitland. He lost the election to John Robinson and unsuccessfully challenged the results. After the election Morrison helped organise a committee to petition British politicians to intervene in Upper Canada to protect the constitution. Members of this committee were against Lieutenant- Governor's dismissal of Judge John Walpole Willis from the Court of King's Bench. In 1832 Solicitor-General Christopher Alexander Hagerman expelled Mackenzie from the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada. Morrison organised a meeting on January 19 to demand that the Lieutenant-Governor call an election so Hagerman and others could explain their actions to voters in Upper Canada. Mackenzie was in England when he was acclaimed in a by-election to a seat in the Legislative Assembly so Morrison spoke at the meeting and encouraged those assembled to join his recently created Upper Canada Central Political Union. Morrison proposed the organisational structure of the political union and in its first election for officers Morrison was elected as the corresponding secretary. In 1834 Morrison was selected again as the reform movement's candidate for the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada in the third riding of York. Morrison won his seat and was reelected in 1836. He was also elected as an alderman in the city of York for St. Andrew's Ward in 1834 and was reelected in this position in 1835 and 1836. In 1835 he became a member of the Toronto Board of Health and served as its chair while he was mayor. In 1836 he was chosen as mayor of Toronto. His mayoralty was focused on the continued controversies in the provincial government but also created new infrastructure projects to improve the water supply and an increased number of gas-powered street lamps. He chose not to run for city council in the preceding municipal election. ==Upper Canada Rebellion== Morrison was a member of the reform movement and regularly attended their meetings in the 1830s. He hesitated before signing the movement's reform declaration in July 1837 but was appointed to their Central Vigilance Committee. When Mackenzie suggested a revolt in October 1837, Morrison reportingly exclaimed, \\"This is treason; if you think to entrap me into any such mad scheme, you will find I am not your man.\\" Witnesses at the meeting stated that Morrison spoke against rebellion and threatened to leave if consideration was continued. In November Thomas Storrow Brown, a leader in the insurrection movement in Lower Canada, asked the Upper Canada radicals to begin their rebellion in order to draw troops away from Lower Canada. In a meeting between Morrison, Mackenzie and John Rolph, Morrison spoke against taking any action and the three agreed that Mackenzie would tour local communities to obtain more support for their cause. Morrison gave Mackenzie permission to tell communities that Morrison supported the rebellion but Mackenzie could not commit to or start any action during the tour. Mackenzie returned to York in the third week of November with a plan to start an armed rebellion on December 7. Morrison was concerned that Mackenzie was being reckless for creating plans for the rebellion without consulting him. He also protested against the amount of authority Mackenzie was giving himself. Morrison and Rolph insisted that Mackenzie convince people with military expertise to help lead the rebellion and Mackenzie promised to recruit Anthony Van Egmond. The Upper Canada Rebellion began the evening of December 6, but Morrison stayed in his home. At midnight a message arrived at Montgomery's Tavern from Morrison and Rolph encouraging Mackenzie to disperse the men assembled there, but Mackenzie ignored the letter. ===Trial=== Morrison was arrested on December 6 by a loyalist militia, charged with high treason for his part in the Upper Canada Rebellion and held without bail until his trial in April 1838. Morrison appeared before a government committee that was investigating the revolt to proclaim his innocence and deny knowledge or participation in the rebellion. At his trial, the Crown argued their charge of treason by calling three witnesses who claimed to have seen Morrison on Yonge Street with Mackenzie on the night of the rebellion. However, the Crown admitted in their opening arguments that the witnesses might be mistaken. One witness stated that he saw Morrison wearing glasses, but Morrison's defence attorney argued that Morrison often wore sunglasses during the day but would not have worn them at night. Fifteen witnesses also testified that Morrison was not on Yonge Street during the rebellion. The Crown brought a second charge of conspiring to form a rebellion and brought forward evidence of his signature on the reform declaration in July 1837. The prosecutor struggled to explain why Morrison was not charged when the declaration was originally published. The Crown also brought evidence that Morisson was at the October meeting where Mackenzie proposed the rebellion, but witnesses to the meeting testified that Morrison was against this proposal when Mackenzie proposed it. Morrison's defence counsel also claimed that the reform declaration could be calling for a convention to discuss political independence from Britain and prominent politicians in Britain were calling for colonies to be more independent without being arrested for advancing this idea. The defence counsel also challenged the idea that the declaration could call for the death of the monarch if the king was not physically present in the city. The jury deliberated for eight hours before rendering a decision. Half an hour into their deliberations the jury inquired about finding Morrison guilty of a crime less serious than high treason, but they were informed that they could not. The jury acquitted Morrison of the crimes brought forward at trial. ==Medical career post-rebellion== Morrison was frightened about being charged again because the jury at his trial inquired into convicting him of a lesser crime. Morrison fled to Rochester to join Rolph before settling outside of Batavia, New York to resume his medical career. In 1843 the Canadian government declared amnesty for anyone involved in the rebellion and Morrison returned to Toronto to continue practising medicine. He also served on multiple hospital boards, lectured at the Toronto School of Medicine, and in 1851 served another term on the Medical Board of Upper Canada. ==Personal life== In 1818 he married Effie Gilbert, née Patrick. Morrison was originally an Anglican and served on the board of the Upper Canada Bible Society. In 1828 Morrison was appointed to the York Bible Society and served as its vice-president. Morrison converted to the Methodist church sometime before 1830 and helped organise the creation of the first Methodist church in York. ==Death== Morrison died on March 19, 1856, of palsy in Toronto at his home on Adelaide Street. ==References== Category:1796 births Category:1856 deaths Category:Members of the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada Category:Mayors of Toronto Category:19th-century Canadian physicians Category:Canadian people of British descent Category:People from York, Upper Canada Category:Politicians from Quebec City Category:Anglophone Quebec people Category:People with cerebral palsy ","title":"Thomas David Morrison"},{"id":"3235375","text":"Hero Squared is an American comic book series published by Boom!

The cast includes Pia Zadora in the title role, Lloyd Bochner, Bibi Besch, Jared Martin, and in an early film appearance, Ray Liotta. The original music score was composed by Charlie Calello. The plot follows Jerilee Randall (Zadora), an aspiring screenwriter who deals with many abusive men in her attempts to achieve success in Hollywood.The Lonely Lady - The Best of The Cinema Snob by Stoned Gremlin Productions on YouTube A critical and commercial failure, The Lonely Lady was the last adaptation of one of Robbins' best selling novels before he died in 1997, and, to date, the last such adaptation of any of his works. Many have considered this to be one of the worst films ever made. ==Plot== Jerilee Randall is an innocent schoolgirl living in the San Fernando Valley area of California with dreams of becoming a famous screenwriter. Shortly after winning a trophy for her creative writing, she meets Walt, the son of famous screenwriter Walter Thornton, at a party. She goes home with him, along with some other friends, and during a late evening pool party, one of Jerilee's friends beats her, slaps her and then sexually assaults her with a garden hose nozzle. Walter arrives after the assault has taken place and saves Jerilee from further attacks. A friendship, then a love affair, develops between them, and they soon marry, despite the disapproval of Jerilee's mother. The marriage begins to fall apart when Jerilee rewrites one of Walter's scripts and is told she had improved it greatly. (She had actually only added the word, \\"Why?\\") Despite this, the revised script works well for the actress delivering the line and she thanks Walter for it. Divorce is inevitable when Walter scorns Jerilee during an argument and accuses her of enjoying having been raped all those years ago. After the divorce, Jerilee has several love affairs while trying to get her own screenplay produced, using her sexual charms to pave the way to recognition, with revenge thrown in the end for good measure. One affair, with actor George Ballantine, quickly ends with her pregnant; upon realizing he would not support her, she gets an abortion. While meeting club owner Vincent Dacosta, who has contacts to agents who can help produce a screenplay, Jerilee ends up working for him as a waitress for a short time. Eventually she has an affair with him as well, and when visiting the agent he had promised would possibly approve of, she realizes that she has been had and that he sent her there to have sex with him and another woman. After confronting Vincent about this, he gives Jerilee her screenplay back, laughing about it while on drugs with two other women. Jerilee finally has a nervous breakdown in a sequence wherein she sees the callous people of her past appear as faces on the keys of her typewriter. After spending a few days in a mental facility, Jerilee rewrites her screenplay. Upon meeting director Guy Jackson, he does help her get her screenplay produced successfully; however, once again she's expected to have sex, this time with Mrs. Jackson. At the live awards telecast, Jerilee ultimately wins a prestigious award for her screenplay of a film titled The Hold-Outs. On stage, she admits to her ex-husband Walter Thornton that she has never learned \\"the meaning of self-respect\\" and bluntly speaks out about the Hollywood system in which women have to \\"fuck [their] way to the top\\". Jerilee then refuses to accept the award, and walks out of the auditorium with her newfound dignity. ==Cast== * Pia Zadora as Jerilee Randall * Lloyd Bochner as Walter Thornton * Bibi Besch as Veronica Randall * Joseph Cali as Vincent Dacosta * Anthony Holland as Guy Jackson * Jared Martin as George Ballantine * Ray Liotta as Joe Heron * Kerry Shale as Walt Thornton, Jr. * Sandra Dickinson as Nancy Day * Glory Annen Clibbery as Marion * Lou Hirsch as Bernie * Ed Bishop as Doctor Baker * Shane Rimmer as Adolph Fannon *Gianni Rizzo as Gino Paoluzzi *Mickey Knox as Tom Castel *Kenneth Nelson as Bud Weston *Jay Benedict as Doctor Sloane *Billy J.

However, despite multiple drafts by Robert Merrill and Dean Riesner, Blakely was never satisfied with the script and eventually opted out of the project. The Lonely Lady only eventually entered production as Israeli multimillionaire industrialist Meshulam Riklis joined the production in 1982. Riklis had already funded Butterfly, released that same year, to serve as vehicle for his wife Pia Zadora, and wanted The Lonely Lady to have the same purpose. Riklis was reportedly supplying approximately half of the film's $6–7 million budget, along with completion costs, but refused any mention in credits. Robert R. Weston, responsible for the previous Robbins adaptation The Betsy, was the producer. Butterfly director Matt Cimber would write the script, before being replaced by Ellen Shepard and the duo John Kershaw and Shawn Randall. Principal photography began on June 14, 1982 at a villa near Rome, where various Los Angeles landmarks and architecture were constructed, from the exterior of the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion to local supermarkets, although some exterior photography was also planned for Los Angeles. Interiors were shot at Twickenham Studios in Middlesex, England. ==Reception== The Lonely Lady was heavily panned by critics. Roger Ebert opened his review saying that \\"If The Lonely Lady had even a shred of style and humor, it could qualify as the worst movie of the year. Unfortunately, it's not that good.\\" The Lonely Lady, Roger Ebert Janet Maslin of The New York Times complimented that Zadora \\"[has] got spunk\\", while still being \\"the tiny centerpiece of a badly acted slovenly looking movie that isn't even much fun.\\"'LONELY LADY,' FROM A ROBBINS NOVEL The Lonely Lady currently holds a 0% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on twelve reviews.Rotten Tomatoes Zadora herself said that The Lonely Lady was \\"a real turkey, done very badly\\" that she \\"knew it was bad all along\\" that despite being taken seriously by its director became a \\"camp classic, one of those movies that's so bad it's funny.\\" She added that she attempted to prevent the release: \\"I wanted my husband to buy it, to buy the whole thing and hide it somewhere. That movie certainly didn't help my credibility problem.\\"Hunt, Dennis. \\"Zadora Looking For Credibility\\"; The Los Angeles Times, 19 November 1985 ===Robbins' reaction=== Harold Robbins said shortly after the release that he had not seen the adaptation of his novel, criticizing the casting of Pia Zadora, who he claimed that \\"seem[ed] like a nice girl, but not my idea of the main character\\" and concluding that \\"the movie will be a bummer, everyone will lose money. Except me. I got six hundred thousand dollars before it opened.\\" Robbins' then-assistant and future wife Jann Stapp reports in her book Harold and Me that Robbins only saw a rough cut at Universal's screening room, telling her afterwards that he slept during the projection, derided Zadora as \\"not an actress, she can't carry the picture\\", and summed up the production as \\"It's crap, I don't know what they did in Italy but it turned into shit\\". ===Awards=== The film was nominated for 11 Golden Raspberry Awards and won six: Worst Actress, Worst Director, Worst Musical Score, Worst Original Song (\\"The Way You Do It\\"), Worst Picture, and Worst Screenplay. When questioned about the awards, Zadora stated that \\"I would have hated to be nominated and not won [sic]\\". It was also nominated for a Razzie as Worst Picture of the Decade, but lost to Mommie Dearest, and as Worst Drama of the Razzies' First 25 Years, but lost to Battlefield Earth. Zadora won Worst New Star of the Decade for this film along with Butterfly. She was also nominated for Worst Actress of the Century, but lost to Madonna. John J.B. Wilson included it in The Official Razzie Movie Guide as one of the most enjoyable bad movies ever. In its entry, he notes how being hired for the promotional campaign was \\"one of my alltime favorite assignments as a trailermaker\\" given he knew it was a potential Golden Raspberry winner, and even convinced producer Robert R. Weston not to cut an infamous scene where JeriLee has a breakdown, hoping to use the clip in Razzie ceremonies. The movie was nominated for a Stinkers Bad Movie Awards for Worst Picture, but lost to Krull. ==Home media== Shout Factory released the film on Blu-ray June 13th, 2017.The Lonely Lady - Blu-rayShout!

Vol. 1, 2, 3 vol. 1 pp. 435 -436 Her father was consul in 119 BC and her paternal grandfather of the same name was consul in 144 BC. The family of the Aurelii Cottae was prominent during the Roman Republican era. Her mother Rutilia, was a member of the gens Rutilia. They were of consular rank. Publius Rutilius Rufus was her maternal uncle. Three of her brothers were consuls: Gaius Aurelius Cotta in 75 BC, Marcus Aurelius Cotta in 74 BC and Lucius Aurelius Cotta in 65 BC. Aurelia married a praetor Gaius Julius Caesar. Her husband died 85 – 84 BC. Their children were: * Julia Major (102 - 68 BC), wife of Pinarius and grandmother of Lucius Pinarius; * Julia Minor (101 – 51 BC), wife of Marcus Atius and grandmother of emperor Augustus; * Gaius Julius Caesar (100 – 44 BC), the Dictator perpetuo ==Character== The historian Tacitus considered her an ideal Roman matron and thought highly of her, because she offered her children the best opportunities of education.Dialogus de oratoribus section xxviii by Tacitus (published c. 102 CE), referenced in 'Caesar, Gaius Julius' in Encyclopædia Britannica (1911) (copy archived by WikiSource). Plutarch described her as a woman of discretion.'Caesar' in Lives of the Noble Greeks and Romans by Plutarch (published c. 100-120 CE) translated by John Dryden (1683) Highly intelligent, independent and renowned for her beauty and common sense, Aurelia was held in high regard throughout Rome. Aurelia and her family were very influential in her son’s upbringing and security. Her husband, the elder Gaius Caesar, was often away, so the task of raising their son fell mostly on Aurelia's shoulders. When the younger Caesar was about 18, he was ordered by the then dictator of Rome, Lucius Cornelius Sulla, to divorce his young wife Cornelia Cinna, daughter of Lucius Cornelius Cinna who had supported Sulla's archenemy Marius. Young Caesar firmly refused, and by so doing, put himself at great risk from Sulla. Aurelia became involved in the petition to save her son, defending him along with her brother Gaius Cotta. After Cornelia's death in childbirth, Aurelia raised her young granddaughter Julia in her stead and presided as mistress over her son's households. Caesar subsequently married Pompeia Sulla, granddaughter of Sulla. In 62 BC, during the Bona Dea festival held at Caesar’s house, one of Cornelia's maid discovered that Publius Clodius had infiltrated the house while disguising as a woman, in order to start or continue an affair with her second daughter-in-law Pompeia. The two may have had certain improper relations before, but was subdued by Aurelia's close watch upon the women's residence. Clodius was later charged with the crime of sacrilege by Lucius Lentulus since his trespass caused the interruption of the sacrifice. Aurelia later appeared as a witness during the trial, along with Julia, testifying that she had ordered Clodius to leave. ==See also== * Woman of Rome * List of Roman women ==References== Category:120 BC births Category:54 BC deaths Category:2nd-century BC Roman women Category:1st-century BC Roman women Category:Family of Julius Caesar Category:Aurelii Cottae ","title":"Aurelia (mother of Caesar)"},{"id":"3235433","text":"This is page shows results of Canadian federal elections in the Winnipeg area. ==Regional profile== The city of Winnipeg has traditionally been a mixed bag, in which all three major parties have bases of support.

The outer suburban areas tilt rightward, but this was obscured for most of the 1990s by massive vote- splitting. The end of vote-splitting on the right allowed the Conservatives to win two seats in 2004, in one case defeating a star candidate. The Conservatives picked up another seat in 2006, one more in 2008 and two additional seats in 2011—including Elmwood-Transcona, the former seat of longtime NDP MP and former deputy leader Bill Blaikie. In 2015, however, the Liberals took all but one seat in Winnipeg en route to their second-largest seat count ever. The only seat that didn't get swept up in the Liberal tide was Elmwood-Transcona, where Blaikie's son Daniel Blaikie narrowly retook the seat for the NDP.

He was responsible for organizing several civilian airplane hijackings in support of the Palestinian cause in the 1960s and 1970s. ==Early years and education== Haddad was born to Palestinian Christian (Greek Orthodox) parents in Safed, Palestine, in 1927. During the 1948 Arab–Israeli War his family's home was destroyed and his family fled to Lebanon. He studied medicine at the American University of Beirut, where he met fellow Palestinian refugee, George Habash, who was also a medical student. Together they helped found the Arab Nationalist Movement (ANM), a pan-Arabist and Arab socialist group aiming to create the State of Palestine and unite the Arab countries. After graduating, he relocated with Habash (a pediatrician) to Amman, Jordan, where they established a clinic. He worked with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) in 1956, but due to his Palestinian nationalist activism he was arrested by the Jordanian authorities in 1957. In 1961, he managed to escape to Syria. Haddad argued for armed struggle against Israel from 1963 onwards, and succeeded in militarizing the ANM. ==Role in PFLP== After the 1967 Six-Day War, the Palestinian wing of the ANM transformed into a socialist Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), under the leadership of Habash. Haddad became the leader of the military wing of the group, involved in organizing attacks on Israeli targets. He helped plan the first PFLP aircraft hijacking in 1968, when an Israeli El Al plane was hijacked. He argued for and organized hijackings, despite criticism against the PFLP from within the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). The Dawson's Field hijackings of 1970, when PFLP members including Leila Khaled brought three passenger jets to Jordan, helped provoke the bloody fighting of Black September. After the expulsion of the PLO factions from Jordan, Haddad was subjected to harsh criticism from the PFLP, which was in turn under pressure from the rest of the PLO. Haddad was ordered not to attack targets outside of Israel, but he continued operations under the name of Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – External Operations (PFLP-EO). Haddad was expelled from the organization PFLP in 1973. He also employed the services of Ilich Ramírez Sánchez, better known as \\"Carlos the Jackal\\", whom he had met in 1970 and trained in guerrilla warfare techniques. Haddad decided to expel Sánchez from his team after Sánchez had been accused of refusing to kill two hostages, and possibly stealing ransom money, following the 1975 assault on the OPEC conference in Vienna. Haddad organized the Entebbe hijacking in June 1976. ==Death== Haddad died on 28 March 1978 in the German Democratic Republic, supposedly from leukemia. According to the book Striking Back, published by Aaron J. Klein in 2006, Haddad was eliminated by the Mossad, which had sent the chocolate-loving Haddad Belgian chocolates coated with a slow-acting and undetectable poison which caused him to die several months later. According to a 2018 book by Ronen Bergman, Mossad killed Haddad by poisoning his toothpaste.\\"Mossad chose not to nab Mengele, didn’t hunt down Munich terrorists, book claims\\", Times of Israel, 26 January 2018. What remained of the PFLP-EO dissolved after his death, but in the process inaugurated the 15 May Organization and the PFLP-SC. ==KGB agent== According to Vasili Mitrokhin, a senior KGB archivist who defected to the UK in 1992, in early 1970 Haddad was recruited by the KGB as an agent, codenamed NATIONALIST. Thereafter, in deep secrecy the Soviets helped to fund and arm the PFLP. The KGB had warning of its major operations and almost certainly sanctioned the most significant, such as the September 1970 hijackings. Haddad remained a highly valued agent till his death in 1978.Andropov to Brezhnev, 23 April 1974 (1071-A/ov), collaboration with Haddad and the PFLP. A letter by KGB chairman Yuri Andropov to Leonid Brezhnev, the Soviet leader and head of the Communist Party, about the covert transfer of arms to the PFLP refers to Haddad as a \\"trusted KGB intelligence agent\\".Andropov to Brezhnev, 16 May 1975 (1218-A/ov).

Merrie Melodies animated short directed by Robert McKimson and written by Tedd Pierce. The short was released on July 26, 1952, and stars Bugs Bunny. The plot also has similarities to the plot of the short The Fair-Haired Hare, which was released one year earlier and it features Devil Rich Texan as Bugs' antagonist. Oily Hare also recycles the same ending where Bugs' home is filled with explosives and blown up. ==Synopsis== The production of oil in Texas has brought a few wealth-related changes: a road sign that is next to an oil field and along Highway $101.00, approximately 531 miles from Dallas, now \\"Dollar$ Texa$\\", and 20 miles from \\"Deepinahearta Texa$\\", is 12 inches away from \\"Deepinahola Texa$\\", and Bugs' rabbit hole, in the oil field. In his hole, Bugs sings a wealth-themed variation of \\"Home on the Range\\" with a banjo. An oil tycoon, who sounds, acts and looks like Yosemite Sam, is upset by Bugs' hole because, as a hole on his oil field, it is not producing any oil. He pulls up to the hole in a green stretch limousine that is so long it requires a long-distance telephone operator in the middle of the car to connect the tycoon to his chauffeur, Maverick, so he can tell Maverick (who does not have a speaking role, but communicates by nodding his head) to stop the car. The tycoon says: \\"Stop the car, Maverick! There's a hole on my property that ain't a-gushin' oil!\\" On the back door of the limousine, a crest is shown which carries the legend, \\"Orvil Rich—Texan\\". Maverick stops the car, pulls a motor scooter out from behind the driver's seat (a Western saddle) and rides the scooter back to Devil Rich Texan back door. After Maverick opens the door, Devil Rich Texan gets out and they both walk over to Bugs' hole. After Devil Rich Texan surveys the situation, he and Maverick build a derrick over the top of the hole. As they finish, Bugs comes up and asks \\"What's up doc?\\". Then Devil Rich Texan explains and tells Bugs to \\"git\\". Bugs tells him the hole is, in fact, his home and tells the tycoon to drill someplace else. Devil Rich Texan tries to evict Bugs, which gets Bugs' dander up. He sends down a box of dynamite, but hears party horns whenever he tries detonating it, and when he has it brought back up, he finds a birthday cake with the lit dynamite sticks for candles. \\"Now who could'a knowed it was my birthday, especially when it 'tain't?\\" asks the tycoon. Bugs tells him to make a wish, and he says: \\"Ah wish...Ah wish...nah: I've got too much of that filthy green stuff already! I know!\\" He tries to blow out the candles but the dynamite blows up in his face and blowing his nose off in the process, forcing him to cover the injury with his hands. Devil Rich Texan tries to trick Bugs by saying, \\"I've got a proposition to talk to you about.\\" When Bugs shows himself, Devil Rich Texan tries to shoot (\\"What I've got to say, I'm a-sayin' with lead!\\"), but Bugs fits a pipe with elbows through his ladder and the soil wall of his hole, with a funnel on one end, so the bullets go into the funnel and are directed into Devil Rich Texan's butt. Devil Rich Texan, enraged, orders Maverick to get Bugs out. Bugs steals Maverick's clothes and comes out of the hole dressed as Maverick. Devil Rich Texan decides to get Bugs himself, but can't find him. Bugs lifts the hat to the audience to confirm that it's him. Devil Rich Texan calls for Maverick, who's still in Bugs' hole, then, ignorant of the situation, calls up the hole for Maverick to lower some dynamite. Bugs sends down as much as possible, at Devil Rich Texan's demands, who says: \\"I'll blow the critter to the outskirts of Dallas!\\" Bugs, Devil Rich Texan and Maverick fill the hole with so many sticks of dynamite that Devil Rich Texan, who is in the hole, can't see his hand before his face. Bugs calls down and tells him to look in his left hand dresser drawer for his \\"cigareet\\" lighter, which he uses while still in the hole. After the explosion, instead of oil, a gusher of carrots comes out of the hole blowing Devil Rich Texan and Maverick to the top of the hole's derrick and Bugs exclaims: \\"Hey! Looks like I brought in a carrot gusher!\\". After chomping on one of them, he senses some of the audience's slight disbelief at what they're seeing, adding \\"Yeah, I know, I know...but anything can happen in 'Tex-ay-us'!\\" ==Availability== This short is available on the fifth volume of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection ==References== ==External links== * Oily Hare at Internet Movie Database Category:1952 films Category:1952 animated films Category:1952 short films Category:1950s American animated films Category:1950s animated short films Category:Merrie Melodies shorts Category:Warner Bros.

The civil parish covers Leamington Hastings itself, plus the nearby hamlets of Broadwell, Hill and Kites Hardwick. Its population in the 2001 census was 450, decreasing slightly to 440 at the 2011 census. ==Village== The village is about 7 miles (11 km) south-west of Rugby and west of the A426 road between Rugby and Southam. To the north of the village is the Draycote Water reservoir. Administratively, Leamington Hastings forms part of the Borough of Rugby. The name of the village is due to it being just south of the River Leam, and the 'Hastings' part is due to the 'Hastang' family, the medieval lords of the manor. The village contains the historic Church of All Saints and some preserved 17th-century almshouses. The Christopher Saxton map of Warwickshire (1637 edition) includes a curious transposition: Leamington Hastings appears as Lemington priors, and what is now called Leamington Spa, or Royal Leamington Spa, appears as Lemington hastings. The first mention of a post office in Leamington Hastings was in September 1845, when a type of postmark known as an undated circular handstamp was issued.The Undated Circular Marks of the Midland Counties, p. 150. Midland (GB) Postal History Society. (1997). . The village post office closed in May 1979. Leamington Hastings Infant School is located in the village. ==Notable residents== The Victorian philosopher Richard Congreve was born at Leamington Hastings. A branch of the Sitwell family lived at Leamington Hastings, where they had inherited their holdings from a Wheler heiress. Edward Sacheverell Wilmot was lord of the manor from 1801–19. From them the later Wilmot-Sitwell family of Horsley, Derbyshire descended. Rev. Degge Wilmot Sitwell, who lived at The Manor House at Leamington Hastings, served as vicar of the church. His grandson was Major General Hervey Degge Wilmot Sitwell, born in 1896, who served as General Officer commanding the British troops on Java in 1942, when he was captured by Japanese forces and spent the next three years in Japanese prisoner of war camps. He was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1946. From 1953 until 1968 he was Keeper of the Jewel House in London. ==References== ==Sources== * Allen, Geoff. (2000).

The Lejeune homepage uses the latter spelling. was a German cargo liner that was converted to a US Navy troop transport during the Second World War. Her original name was TS (Turbine Ship) Windhuk. ==Civilian liner== Windhuk was built at the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg, Germany and completed in 1936. She was one of a pair of sister ships completed that year for Deutsche Ost-Afrika Linie: the other being TS Pretoria. In peacetime Deutsche Ost-Afrika Linie operated Windhuk mainly between Hamburg, South-West Africa and South Africa. Reports that she operated as a German raider in the Second World War are said to be false.See Lejeune homepage. (Her sister ship, SS Pretoria, later served as a German hospital ship during the closing stages of the War.) ==Onset of WW2== After the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, the Windhuk risked being trapped in Cape Town and sought a means for passage back to Germany. The first leg of her northbound voyage would take her to Lobito, Angola, from there to Buenos Aires as a preferred destination. However this was not possible due to the actions of the pocket battleship Graf Spee. Instead after two months at sea, evading the Royal Navy, the Windhuk set course for Santos, São Paulo, Brazil. To enter the port on December 7th 1939 the crew had renamed the vessel the Santos Maru, repainting the ship at sea and flew a hand-crafted Japanese flag. Once dockside the German flag was raised and the borrowed name painted out. ==Internment in Brazil== The Associated Press reported that on 15 January 1942 the German consul at Santos, Brazil, turned over the Windhuk to the Brazilian government.Associated Press, “Brazilian Government Receives Nazi Ship”, The San Bernardino Daily Sun, San Bernardino, California, Friday 16 January 1942, Volume 48, page 2. Windhuk was still in Santos on 22 August 1942 when Brazil broke ties with Germany and interned the ship. When her crew learned that she was to be interned, they sabotaged most of her machinery. They poured concrete into the main turbine engines. They drained the boilers of water and then lit the furnaces, which melted the boilers beyond repair. They cut her main shafts and bearings with high temperature metal cutting torches. They damaged all electric generators, refrigeration equipment, steering gear, small motors, etc. beyond repair. However, they made no attempt to scuttle the ship.S. Pickett Edwards, US Navy Yard, Portsmouth, VA. 1942-45, as recounted to his daughter Maureen and recorded at Navsource Online. Windhuk remained in Santos until January 1943 when she was towed to Rio de Janeiro for repairs. In 1942 the US Government bought Windhuk from Brazil and sent two hundred US Navy personnel to Brazil to fit her with a new diesel engine. The work was not completed until March 1943, when she made a thirty-day voyage to Norfolk, Virginia for further work and conversion to a troopship. When she arrived in Norfolk, she had been stripped of most of her elegant furnishings such as mahogany and teak wood paneling. She was refitted as a troop transport, which took about a year to rectify all the sabotage by the German crew. While at Norfolk she was named USS Lejeune (AP-74), after USMC General John Archer Lejeune. ==Transatlantic troop ship== Lejeune was fully commissioned in April or May 1944. On 11 June 1944, she began her wartime service in her new role as a US Navy troop transport with a voyage from Norfolk to Glasgow, Scotland, with 4,460 soldiers aboard. Her troop capacity would later be increased to 4,650. Beginning on 12 July, she then made a trip from New York to Glasgow, with 207 officers and 4,307 Navy personnel. In December, she made an Atlantic crossing with elements of the 69th Infantry Division, which was destined to meet Soviet troops on the banks of the Elbe River deep within Germany five months later, in April 1945. Lejeune made a total of ten round-trip transatlantic crossings before the end of the war, and a further nine crossings were made to the United Kingdom, France or Africa in the months immediately after, until she returned to Norfolk 9 May 1946 for overhaul. ==Postwar troop service== On 28 September 1946 Lejeune resumed service. From 19 October 1946 to 1 August 1947, she made a total of four trips to the Pacific, from San Francisco to Shanghai and Tsingtao, China, and to Yokosuka, Japan. She then sailed back to New York City, reaching her destination 29 August, and from there returned to San Francisco 25 September. ==Decommissioning== USS Lejeune departed San Francisco for Bremerton, Washington on 2 October 1947, where she was decommissioned 9 February 1948 and placed in the Pacific Reserve Fleet at Tacoma, Washington. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register in July 1957 and scrapped at Portland, Oregon 16 August 1966. Her ship's bell however was preserved, and in 1971 it was mounted on the flagstaff at Marine Base HQ Camp Lejeune. During her US Navy career Lejeune transported more than 100,000 troops. ==German former crew== During internment in Brazil, the crew was interned (in stables converted into internment camps) in small towns far inland. They were used as a workforce, and during times off were able to play soccer and perform musical presentations. Many married Brazilian women and decided to stay in Brazil, which has had a significant German minority since early in the 19th century. After the war, some of the remaining crew members, especially older ones, returned to Germany. One group of former crew who stayed in Brazil after the war opened a restaurant in São Paulo named after the ship, serving dishes from her former passenger menus. ==References== ==Sources== * * ==External links== * Lejeune homepage. * Lejeune AP-74 - DANFS Online. * AP-74 Lejeune, Navsource Online.

To support him, he solicited the help of non-PFLP organizations such as the Abu Nidal Organization and the West German Revolutionary Cells (RZ). He also employed his PFLP protégé, Ilich Ramírez Sánchez (\\"Carlos\\"), who is currently imprisoned in France for terrorist acts committed in 1982-83. It is unclear to what extent the PFLP-EO formed a faction in the real sense of the word, within the Palestinian nationalist movement. It may simply have been a faction or trend within the PFLP, or possibly a name tag used to shield the PFLP from the political fallout of Haddad's operations. == Downfall == As discontent grew with Haddad's rogue tactics, and the mainstream PLO pressured the PFLP to cease its international operations, Haddad's position became increasingly precarious. After the botched Entebbe Operation in 1976, when Israel gained worldwide sympathy after rescuing more than one hundred airline passengers held by Haddad's PFLP (or PFLP-EO) men and members of the RZ in Uganda, the PFLP leadership responded by expelling him from the organization. Wadie Haddad died in 1978, in East Berlin, East Germany. This was first reported as being from leukaemia, and later from possible poisoning by Mossad. According to the book Striking Back, published by Aaron J. Klein in 2006, Haddad was assassinated by the Mossad, which had sent the chocolate-loving Haddad Belgian chocolates coated with a slow-acting and undetectable poison which caused him to die severals months later. \\"It took him a few long months to die\\", Klein said in the book. == Splinter groups == * The 15 May Organization * Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – Special Command * Lebanese Armed Revolutionary Faction == References == Category:Arab Nationalist Movement breakaway groups Category:Defunct Palestinian militant groups Category:Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine ","title":"Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – External Operations"},{"id":"3235573","text":"Celbalrai, known as Beta Ophiuchi, is a star in the constellation Ophiuchus.

A Yugoslav international right back, he is best known as a player and manager of FK Partizan, of Belgrade. In the United Kingdom he is remembered as one of Southampton's first foreign imports and as a Scottish Cup-winning manager with Dundee United. ==Playing career== ===Partizan=== Golac was born in Koprivnica in PR Croatia then part of FPR Yugoslavia, to father Ivan who was a soldier in President Tito's guard. He moved to Belgrade where he joined the youth section of FK Partizan aged 12 and eventually graduated to the first team. He made over 350 appearances for the club and won League championship medals in 1976 and 1978. During this era, he also made his debut for the national team, but that match against Algeria in 1976 proved to be his only one at international level.Football League Career Stats at Neil Brown > \\"The Yugoslavian League was one of the best in the world; every game was > really tough.

You could put them among the ten biggest derbies in the world ... we > would play in front of crowds of 90–100,000\\"Golac talking in 2006, quoted in ===Southampton=== The year of 1978 would prove to be a watershed in Golac's career. He had reached the age of 28, when Yugoslavia's Communist authorities would allow players to move abroad; it was also the year in which English football's restrictions on foreign players were lifted. Golac was transferred to Southampton in August 1978 for a fee of £50,000, initially on a non- contract basis until problems obtaining a work permit were resolved, before signing a permanent contract in September. He made his Football League debut for them on 22 August 1978 against Bolton Wanderers, and he went on to play 144 League games in his first spell with the club.Ivan Golac statistics at Football-Heroes.net He immediately became the established right-back, rarely missing a game over the next four seasons. The Dell crowd soon warmed to his \\"swashbuckling, surging style along the touchline\\" and he was voted the \\"Saints\\" Player of the Year in 1981 although, according to manager Lawrie McMenemy he had a tendency to \\"go missing\\" in away matches. The relationship turned sour in 1982 when a contract dispute between player and club led to Golac going out on loan to AFC Bournemouth in November 1982 and Manchester City in March 1983, before his contract with Southampton was terminated. After a brief spell back in Yugoslavia with minor level club FK Belasica he returned to Southampton in March 1984, helping the Saints finish as runners-up to Liverpool in the Football League. The following season, he lost his place to Mark Dennis and after another period on loan, this time at Portsmouth, Golac retired in 1986, having played 197 games for Southampton, scoring four goals. Writing in the Southern Daily Echo in April 2003, McMenemy said: > \\"He was a terrific professional who trained well and loved 5-a-sides > particularly in the small gym at The Dell where even the best players took > time to get acclimatized to the speed of the action.\\" Of his time with Southampton, Golac said: > \\"Beautiful football, beautiful supporters and beautiful days. From day one, > from the very first kick, I could sense a connection with the crowd. They > were terrific.\\" > \\"There was fire on the park – The Dell was always in flames and a lot of the > opponents from London, Manchester and Liverpool just couldn't stand the > heat.\\" ==Managerial career== Following the end of his playing days, Golac turned to coaching, where his laid-back, positive style led to further successes. Returning to Partizan, he became assistant to manager Momčilo Vukotić in 1989 and helped the club to Yugoslav Cup success that year. The following September, Golac had an extraordinary debut in management when Vukotić was taken ill on the eve of a Cup Winners' Cup first round tie against Celtic in Glasgow, with Partizan leading 2–1 from the first leg. An astonishing match saw Golac's team progress on away goals after a 5–4 victory for Celtic. Golac remained in charge at Partizan for the rest of the season before parting company with the club. He still had a home in Hampshire, and returned to Britain in search of work. After being unsuccessfully shortlisted for the manager's job at old adversaries Celtic, he had a brief spell in charge of Torquay United during 1992. Then, in July 1993, he was announced as the surprise choice to succeed legendary Dundee United manager Jim McLean. The Scottish sporting media quickly latched on to Golac, whose hippyish public image – he took United players to \\"smell the flowers\\" in Camperdown Park during training sessions, and claimed to have learned English from listening to Rolling Stones records – was in pointed contrast to the austere reputation of his predecessor, McLean. Against the odds, Golac's confident approach led underdogs United to Scottish Cup success at the end of his first season in charge, defeating hot favourites Rangers 1–0 in the final. It was the first time Dundee United had won the trophy, having lost in the final six times under McLean. Despite the Cup triumph, poor League form and the fraught relationship between Golac and McLean (who remained club chairman) led to his departure from the club less than a year later. Since then, he has held several managerial posts around Europe without recording any significant achievements, having been in charge at ÍA Akranes from Iceland in 1997, Sartid Smederevo in Serbia and Karpaty Lviv in Ukraine. In January 1994, he had been linked with Southampton for a possible return as manager following the departure of Ian Branfoot, but the job went to Alan Ball instead. ==Personal life== Outside football, Golac had a spell running a chocolate factory in Belgrade. He is married to Bratislava, with daughters Andrijana and Ivana, and they have homes in Belgrade and Vienna. ==Honours== ===As player=== Partizan *Yugoslav First League: 1975–76, 1977–78 Southampton *Football League Division 1 runners-up: 1983–84 *League Cup finalist: 1979 ===As manager=== Dundee United *Scottish Cup winner: 1994 ==References== Category:1950 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Koprivnica Category:Sportspeople from Belgrade Category:Yugoslav footballers Category:Yugoslavia international footballers Category:Serbs of Croatia Category:Serbian footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:FK Partizan players Category:Southampton F.C. players Category:AFC Bournemouth players Category:Manchester City F.C. players Category:Portsmouth F.C. players Category:Yugoslav First League players Category:English Football League players Category:Serbian expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in England Category:Torquay United F.C. managers Category:Dundee United F.C. managers Category:Serbian football managers Category:Yugoslav football managers Category:Serbian expatriate sportspeople in Iceland Category:FK Partizan managers Category:Expatriate football managers in Iceland Category:Ukrainian Premier League managers Category:FC Karpaty Lviv managers Category:Íþróttabandalag Akraness managers Category:Scottish Football League managers Category:Expatriate football managers in Scotland Category:Expatriate football managers in Ukraine ","title":"Ivan Golac"},{"id":"3235587","text":"The golden-crowned sparrow (Zonotrichia atricapilla) is a large American sparrow found in the western part of North America. ==Systematics== The golden-crowned sparrow is one of five species in the genus Zonotrichia, a group of large American sparrows. It has no subspecies. It is a sister species with, and very closely related to, the white-crowned sparrow; studies of mitochondrial DNA show the two evolved into separate species very recently in geologic time. The white-throated sparrow is a slightly more distant relative. Hybridization with both white-crowned and white-throated sparrows has been reported. Ornithologist John Latham first described the species in his book General Synopsis of Birds in 1781, but he thought it was a variety of what he called the \\"black-crowned bunting\\" and neglected to give it a scientific name. That lapse was corrected in 1789, when Johann Friedrich Gmelin assigned it the name Emberiza atricapilla in the 13th edition of Systema naturae. Various authorities in the 1800s (including John James Audubon) placed it in the genus Fringilla, but many assigned it to its current genus, Zonotrichia, once William John Swainson had established that genus. Peter Simon Pallas described the same species in 1844 as Zonotrichia coronata and, for much of the 1800s, this was the name used by most authorities. In the bird's scientific name, the genus name Zonotrichia is a compound word: the Greek zone means \\"band\\" or \\"girdle\\" and the Greek thrix or trikhos means \\"hair\\". The specific epithet atricapilla is Latin for \\"black-haired\\": ater meaning \\"black\\" and capillus, meaning \\"hair of the head\\". ==Description== The size and color of its crown patches help to determine a bird's status among its flock mates. Measuring in length with a wingspan of and ranging from in mass, the adult golden-crowned sparrow is fairly large for an American sparrow. Like all Zonotrichia sparrows, it has a relatively long, square-tipped tail and a slightly peaked crown. Males and females are similarly plumaged, though males average slightly larger than females. Other than a plain gray nape, the adult's upperparts are grayish-brown, with broad brownish-black streaks on the back and scapulars, and an unstreaked rump. Its underparts are gray, slightly paler on the belly and buffier on the flanks. Its wings and tail are brown, and it shows two white wing bars. Its legs are pale brown, and its bill is dark, with the upper mandible darker than the lower. Its iris is brown. In the breeding season, the golden-crowned sparrow has a broad yellow central crown stripe which becomes pale gray towards the back of the head. ===Similar species=== Although its distinctive crown patches allow for easy identification of the adult golden- crowned sparrow in breeding plumage, an immature or non-breeding bird might be mistaken for a white-crowned or white-throated sparrow. It is distinguished from the former by its crown pattern and dusky (rather than pale pink or yellowish) bill, and from the latter by its larger size, plain throat, and lack of a buff-colored central crown stripe. A young or non-breeding bird may also resemble a female house sparrow, but can be distinguished by its larger size, darker plumage, longer tail and (usually) some amount of dull yellow feathering on its forehead. ==Distribution and habitat== The golden-crowned sparrow is common along the western edge of North America. It is a migratory species, breeding from north-central Alaska (including the Aleutian Islands as far west as Unimak Island) and central Yukon south to the northwestern corner of the US state of Washington, and wintering from southern coastal Alaska to northern Baja California. It has been recorded as a vagrant in Japan and Russia, and occasionally strays as far as the eastern coast of North America, from Nova Scotia to Florida. In the winter, it is generally found in brushy areas, (particularly chaparral), usually in dense shrubs. ==Behavior== The golden-crowned sparrow spends its winters in flocks with conspecifics, but also often with other sparrow species, especially white-crowned sparrows. Flock territories typically range in size from . Individual birds remain with the same flock for the entire winter and return to the same wintering site each year. Studies show that the golden-crowned sparrow's black and gold head stripes are used to signal social status in wintering flocks. Such signals help to reduce the incidence of confrontation between flock mates, thereby reducing such potential costs as injuries or the unnecessary expenditure of energy. The size and color of a bird's crown patches are better predictors of dominance (indicating which bird will avoid confrontation with another) than are the bird's size or sex. Birds with similarly sized gold crown patches are far more likely to engage in agonistic behavior than are those showing differences, and the outcomes of such confrontations can be predicted based on the color of their black stripes. This suggests that social status in this species involves more complexity than a single signal will allow, and that the multiple color patches allow a gradient of interactions between flock mates. ===Feeding=== Immature birds lack the distinctive head stripes of adults. Like other Zonotrichia sparrows, the golden-crowned sparrow feeds on the ground, where it forages by pecking and scratching. It also occasionally leaps into the air after insects or gleans them from foliage. Its diet, particularly in the winter, consists primarily of plant material; items include seeds, berries, flowers and buds, as well as the occasional crawling insect. The species is an important destroyer of weed seeds on the Pacific Slope, with various ryegrasses, fescues, bromes, pigweeds, chickweeds, mulleins, filarees, common knotweed and poison oak among its known food sources. Paired birds commonly forage together, with the male following the female. The species shows two weight peaks each year: one in mid-winter, and a much higher one shortly before it begins its migration north in the spring. The latter elevated weight is maintained until the bird reaches its breeding grounds. ===Breeding and lifespan=== The breeding season runs from late May through early August. Males on the breeding ground sing throughout the day from an exposed perch. The nest is a bulky cup built by the female. Located on the ground (or occasionally on a low branch), it is made of dried plant material and lined with hair, fine grasses and feathers. The female typically lays five eggs, though clutches of three to five have been recorded. The eggs, which are pale green, oval and heavily spotted with reddish-brown, measure (0.65–0.67)×(0.80–0.82) mm (0.026×0.031 in). They are incubated by the female for 11–14 days. The young are altricial—born naked, blind and helpless—but fledge from the nest within 12 days. Both parents feed the young. The oldest known golden-crowned sparrow lived at least 10 years and 6 months; it was banded as an adult one winter, and recaptured nine winters later. ===Voice=== The song is a three-note whistle, descending in pitch. It is very distinctive, and often described as oh-dear-me. The call also sounds like the words I'm so weary, so Alaskan gold miners along the trails called this bird \\"Weary Willie\\". However, birds in the mountains of British Columbia have been reported to have a trill on the third note, rather than a clear whistle as in other populations. These songs are heard mainly in the breeding season, but also in the wintering grounds just after fall migration as well as just before they take off for spring migration. Like other Zonotrichia sparrows, it has a sharp, distinctive call note, which is transcribed as tsew. ==Conservation and threats== The International Union for the Conservation of Nature lists the golden-crowned sparrow as a species of least concern. The sparrow's extremely large range and population size lift it well above the thresholds used to designate an imperiled species, and data from Christmas Bird Counts show that its numbers are stable or increasing. Throughout its range, it is protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918, and many of its wintering grounds are in protected areas, including national forests and national wildlife refuges. As with other flock-living passerines, the golden-crowned sparrow is prone to elevated levels of feather mites. It serves as a host for chiggers, chewing lice, including Machaerilaemus maestum, and hippoboscid flies, including Ornithoica vicina. Diseases which are known to affect it include canarypox. A number of predators prey on the golden-crowned sparrow at some point in its life cycle. These include northern and loggerhead shrikes, sharp-shinned and Cooper's hawks, northern harriers, merlins, mountain pygmy owls, western screech owls, barn owls, feral cats, and Columbian ground squirrels. ==References== ===Works cited=== * * ==External links== * Golden-crowned sparrow media on the Handbook of Birds of the World's Internet Bird Collection website * Golden-crowned sparrow photographs on the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences Visual Resources for Ornithology website * Golden-crowned sparrow sound recordings on xeno-canto.org Category:Zonotrichia Category:Native birds of Alaska Golden-crowned sparrow Golden-crowned sparrow ","title":"Golden-crowned sparrow"},{"id":"3235602","text":"Little Britain is set in many fictional towns and cities in Britain.

The space inside the skull is formed by eight cranial bones known as the neurocranium. The neurocranium is the upper back part that forms the protective case around the brain. The skull cap of the neurocranium covers the cranial cavity and the remainder of the skull is called the facial skeleton. The skull (minus the mandible) is also known as the cranium, and contains the brain. Meninges are protective membranes that surround the brain to minimize damage of the brain when there is head trauma. Meningitis is the inflammation of meninges caused by bacterial or viral infections. == Structure == The capacity of an adult human cranial cavity is 1,200–1,700 cm3. The spaces between meninges and the brain are filled with a clear cerebrospinal fluid, increasing the protection of the brain. Facial bones of the skull are not included in the cranial cavity. There are only eight cranial bones: The occipital, two parietal, the frontal, two temporal, the ethmoid and the sphenoid bones are fused together by the ossification of fixed fibrous sutures. The frontal and sphenoid bones are towards the front middle of the skull and in front of the temporal bone. The ethmoid bone is the bone at the roof of the nose that separates the naval cavity from the brain. It is a part of the dorsal cavity the cranial cavity and the spinal cord. The occipital bone is at the back of the skull. The dorsal cavity is lined by the three meninges. The three meninges are the three membranes that envelop the brain and spinal cord, in which the central nervous system developed, which are the pia mater, the arachnoid mater, and the dura mater. The latter is the thickest and outermost of the three membrane layers; it contains the most collagen, and it is derived from the mesoderm - the middle germ layer or the primary layer of the cells formed in embryogenic development via epigenetic effects induced by developmental cues, in the early embryo. Also there are the two parietal bones and the two temporal bones, which are a part of the dorsal cavity located on the posterior of the body. The occipital bone found in the rear of the skull is thicker to limit fractures caused by blows to the back of the head. The eight bones are blended together to form the cranial cavity. The pituitary gland is also found in the make up of the cranial cavity. It plays a major role in the body, creating and secreting many bodily hormones. The gland secretes different fluids that are important for the body to function. The body's temperature, physical, and sexual functions are regulated by this gland. One of the major glands are controlled through this cavity. The cerebrum is the most anterior part of the brain, located in the top half of the skull, consisting of two hemispheres separated by a fissure and connected by the corpus callosum. It is responsible for integrating complex sensory and neural functions, and subsequently initiating and coordinating voluntary activity in the body. The cortex is the outer layer of the cerebrum, composed of folded grey matter. Its neuron cell bodies, dendrites, synapses, axons, and axon terminals play a crucial role in consciousness. The two hemispheres are divided into four lobes, distinct sections of the organ: the frontal lobe, parietal lobe, temporal lobe, and occipital lobe. Our understanding of the specific functions of the cerebral cortex are based on the theories of localisation and lateralisation. Localisation is the theory that specific areas of the brain are associated with/responsible for particular physical and psychological functions. Lateralisation is the theory that one hemisphere is dominant over the other/responsible for particular physical and psychological functions. The meninges are the three membranes that line the skull and vertebral canal, and enclose the brain and spinal cord. The Cerebrospinal Fluid serves a vital function in the cerebral autoregulation of cerebral blood flow. Cerebrospinal Fluid occupies the subarachnoid space and the ventricular system around and inside the brain and spinal cord. Neurocranium Intracranial pressure Paranasal sinuses == Function == There are twelve cranial nerves that are responsible for controlling the cranial cavity. These nerves are responsible for providing necessary sensory information for things such as smell, taste, hearing, and sight. The ability to sleep and chew is also a part of one of the things the cranial cavities in charge of. In order for the cranial cavity to be able to do all these functions it has to have the organs to be able to control those systems. The cranial cavity houses the Brain, Meninges, and the Cerebrospinal Fluid. The primary function of the brain is supplying information to the rest of the body and to help it function as whole. It helps supply some of the cranial nerves from the face to the feet and also to help get the body performing critical bodily functions. The cranial cavity includes eight cranial bones and they are collectively combined to form this area. A gland that is found in this cavity is called the pituitary gland which secretes different fluids that are necessary for different parts of the body to function. There are many things that are regulated by this gland such as body temperature, physical growth, and sexual functions. The pituitary gland also controls the thyroid gland. The cranial cavity has a variety of spinal and cranial nerves residing in it. The cranial nerves are responsible for storing sensory information needed for taste, smell, sight and the ability to hear. The spinal nerves allow for the sensory and motor signals to be received, which provide a normal feeling and function for the arms and legs. == Clinical significance == In the event that the brain strikes the inside of the skull, there is a risk of a minor traumatic brain injury (concussion). This type of injury can alter brain function, cause memory loss, headaches an or nausea. A minor traumatic brain injury can be followed by post concussion syndrome. As there are a number of structures in the cranial cavity a traumatic injury to the head can potentially cause major damage to the brain. This is why it is recommended to get medical attention following a head injury. a moderate injury may cause a few negative effects, if any, while a severe injury to the contents of the cavity may have catastrophic results, including death. There are a number of structures in the cranial cavity that can be effected when you get a traumatic injury to the head. These injuries can be potentially cause major damage to the brain. Moderate injuries can cause a few negative effects while, a severe injury to cranial cavity or any contents, can have very serious results, including death. The Cranial Cavity houses the meninges, as well as other necessary organs and these membranes surround the central nervous system. If an infection forms, it can lead to a disease called meningitis which can be potentially fatal. Martini R, Ober W, Garrison C, Welch K, and Hutchings RT. 2001.

His mother Gregoria descended from Basil I's brother Bardas. The greatest coup of his early career was a brilliant defense of Constantinople against the army of Svyatoslav I of Kiev in 970. During the Battle of Arcadiopolis, he reportedly managed to inflict as many as 20,000 casualties on the Rus, while the campaign claimed the lives of merely 25 Greek soldiers. After he had shown himself equal to dealing with the fiercest enemies of Byzantium, Bardas became a trusted advisor to John I Tzimiskes, who was his brother-in-law and a fellow Armenian. Upon John's death, Skleros aspired to replace him as an acting emperor. The eunuch Basil Lekapenos, who actually led the imperial government, entertained other plans, however, deposing Bardas from his key post of general in the East in 976. According to Michael Psellos, Skleros was \\"a man who was not only a competent planner, but extremely clever in carrying out his schemes, possessed of vast wealth (no mean asset in one who aimed at a throne), with the prestige of royal blood and of success in great wars, with all the military caste at his side to help on his enterprise.\\" ==Rebellion== Clash between the armies of Skleros and Phokas, miniature from the Madrid Skylitzes Upon hearing the news of his deposition, Skleros came to an agreement with local Armenian, Georgian and even Muslim rulers who all vowed to support his claims to the imperial crown. He successfully stirred up rebellion among his relatives and adherents in the Asian provinces, rapidly making himself master of Caesaria, Antioch, and most of Asia Minor. After several navy commanders defected to Skleros's side, he dashed to Constantinople, threatening to blockade the Dardanelles. The rebel navy under Michael Kourtikios raided the Aegean and attempted to blockade the Dardanelles, but were defeated by the Imperial Fleet under the command of Theodoros Karantenos. Having lost supremacy at sea, Skleros at once laid siege to the town of Nicaea, which was considered a key to the capital. The town was fortified by a certain Manuel Erotikos Komnenos, father of the future emperor Isaac Komnenos and progenitor of the Komnenoi dynasty. Meanwhile, Basil recalled from exile Bardas Phokas the Younger, a general who had revolted in the previous reign and been interned in a monastery for seven years. Phokas proceeded to Sebastea in the East, where his family demesnes were situated. He came to an understanding with David III Kuropalates of Tao, who pledged 12,000 Georgian horsemen under the command of Tornikios to Phokas' aid. Skleros instantly left Nicaea for the East and defeated Phokas in two battles, but the latter was victorious in a third. On March 24, 979 two leaders clashed in single combat, with Skleros cutting the right ear of Phocas' horse with his lance before sustaining a grave wound to the head. The rumour of his death put his army to flight, but Skleros himself found shelter with his Muslim allies. Thereupon the rebellion was subdued without difficulty. ==Later years== After the Asian potentates refused to support his further operations against Constantinople, Skleros and his family retreated to Baghdad in 980. They resided in honourable captivity at the Abbasid Caliph's court for six years, dreaming about the invasion of Byzantium. In 987 Skleros was finally recalled to his homeland by Phokas, who took advantage of the Bulgarian wars to aim at the crown. Skleros promptly mustered an army to support Phokas's cause, but his plans of profiting from the attendant disorders were frustrated when Phokas had him committed to prison. Upon Phokas' death at the Battle of Abydos (989), Skleros succeeded him as the leader of the rebellion: \\"The truth was, the men who had enrolled in Skleros's army were no longer divided in their loyalties: every one of them was a declared rebel. Their leader inspired them with his own resolute determination and bound them into one coherent body. By favours he won their loyalty, by his kindliness he earned their devotion. He reconciled their differences, ate at the same table as his men, drank from the same cup, called them by name, and by his flattery bound them to his allegiance\\" (Michael Psellos). The date of his surrender to the authorities is disputed, as are the circumstances. In 991 Skleros, a blinded and broken man, then residing in semi-captivity in Thrace, was visited by Emperor Basil II on his way to Bulgaria. The famous rebel accepted the title of curopalates and died several days later, presumably on April 2. ==Descendants== The bloodline of Bardas Skleros continued, however. A grandson, Basil Skleros, was married to a sister of Emperor Romanos III. One of Basil's daughters married Constantine Monomachos, who would become Emperor, while Basil's granddaughter became mistress of Constantine. One of these women was the grandmother of Vladimir Monomakh. ==References== == Sources == * Catherine Holmes: Basil II and the Governance of Empire, 976–1025. Oxford University Press, Oxford 2005, .

Subsequently James IV, King of Scots in 1489, leased the Crownlands in Bute, which in 1503 was embodied in one general charter of the 30th Parliament and detailed in the Exchequer Rolls, land assigned to the Makwrerdys, Makarartys, McVarathy, Banachtynes, Stewarts, etc, the greater portion being assigned to the Makwrerdys, consisting of the following properties: # \\"To Gilchrist Makwrerdy, half of Bruchag and Bransare, and the 22 shilling and three penny land of Berone.\\" # \\"To Gilchrist Makwrerdy, Jr., the eleven shillings and five penny land of Berone.\\" # \\"To Finlay Makwrerdy, half of Langil-Culcreith and half of Kerrymanach and half of Stramanane.\\" # \\"To John Makwrerdy, half of Stramanane and half of Danallid.\\" # \\"To Donald Makwrerdy, two-thirds of Bernaul and Langil-Culcathla.\\" # \\"To Alexander Makwrerdy, half of Cowleing.\\" Most of the above lands eventually descended to Robert Makwrerdy, the Baron of Garrochty. There are traditions existing in many families that the Mackirdys descended from a chieftain named Gilchrist, who was supposed to have flourished about 1525; whether this was Gilchrist of Bruchag, his son Gilchrist, or a son of one of the other Makwrerdys mentioned in the general charter is unknown. Be that as it may, Gilchrist the chieftain had four sons: Gilchrist, Donald, Finlay and John. Donald was the father of Donald Jr. and Alexander; the latter's son Robert was the father of Robert, the Baron of Garrochty, to whom most of the feudal lands descended. Donald, Jr. was probably born about 1550 and may be properly termed the \\"Founder of the Mackirdys\\" as he was the first, so far as known, to contract the name from Makwrerdy. Of his children we have no authentic account except of his son Fingal, who was killed with his father in a battle in which they were allied with a Cameron clan in 1600, so Fingal's son Donald became their heir. Donald MacKirdy was born about 1598; he married Mary Margaret \\"Peggy\\" Cameron, a great grand daughter of James IV, King of Scots; they had six sons: Irven; Pethric, Fingal, Daniel, Gilkrist and Alexander; of two of these sons, nothing is known. Pethric McCurdy, the first known to use this iteration of the name, was born about 1648. His father's name undoubtedly was Daniel, the son of Donald and Peggy Mackirdy. Pethric McCurdy married Margaret Stewart, daughter of Charles Stewart of Ballintoy, Ireland. ==Descendency and diaspora== It is through the marriage of Petheric McCurdy to Margaret Stewart that most McCurdy families in the Eastern and Southern United States can trace their roots as Petheric and Margaret's sons John, Daniel and James immigrated to Pennsylvania and South Carolina during the Colonial period. *The names of McCurdy, McCready, McCurry, McQuady, McCurdie and other similar names are generally believed to have descended from the Mackirdy stock as research in many cases has proven. ==Notable McCurdys== The following is a list of notable people with the surname McCurdy: * Alexander McCurdy, American organist and educator * Allie Hann-McCurdy, Canadian ice dancer * Arthur Williams McCurdy, Canadian businessman, inventor and astronomer * Bob McCurdy (1952–2020), American basketball player * Brendan McCurdy, American television actor * Charles McCurdy, British politician * Charles J.

Born in Saint-Martin-lès-Melle, Deux-Sèvres, France, his father was a painter who moved to Paris when Marcel was a boy. There he attended the Lycée Condorcet. The Brillouin family returned to Saint-Martin-lès-Melle during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 to escape the fighting. There he spent time teaching himself from his grandfather's philosophy books. After the war, he returned to Paris and entered the École Normale Supérieure in 1874 and graduated in 1878. He became a physics assistant to Eleuthere Mascart (his future father-in-law) at the Collège de France, while at the same time working for his doctorates in mathematics and physics, which he gained in 1880 and 1882, respectively. Brillouin then held successive posts as assistant professor of physics at universities in Nancy, Dijon and Toulouse before returning to the École Normale Supérieure in Paris in 1888. Later, he was Professor of Mathematical Physics at the Collège de France from 1900 to retirement in 1931. In 1911 he was one of only six French physicists invited to the first Solvay Conference. He was awarded the Prix La Caze for 1912. Brillouin was elected to the Académie des Sciences in 1921. He was an officer of the Legion of Honour. During his career he was the author of over 200 experimental and theoretic papers on a wide range of topics which include the kinetic theory of gases, viscosity, thermodynamics, electricity, and the physics of melting conditions. Most notably he: *built a new model of the Eötvös balance, *wrote on Helmholtz flow and the stability of aircraft, *worked on a theory of the tides. Brillouin died in Paris (16 June 1948).

He began his career as a painter and then transitioned to performance art before making a comeback to painting.Peppiatt, Michael, Peterson, Jane A., Art Plural: Voices of Contemporary Art, Gatehouse, http://artpluralgallery.com/catalogue/doc_artists/a85/AP-Book-Release.pdf He is primarily known for his performance work, but also makes photographs and sculpture. ==Early life and education== Zhang was born in Anyang, Henan Province and named Dong Ming () as a tribute to Chairman Mao. At the age of one, he was sent to live in rural Tangyin County for eight years with his grandmother. He received his B.A. from Henan University in Kaifeng (1988) and his M.A. from the China Central Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing (1993); he changed his name to Zhang Huan in the 1990s when he started his studies at the Central Academy. ==Career== ===Performance art=== Zhang Huan helped to establish a small artistic community known as the Beijing East Village, located on the margins of the city. The group of friends from art school pioneered this particular brand of performance in China and Zhang was often reprimanded by officials for the perceived inappropriateness of his actions. Zhang's performance art always involves his body in one way or another, usually naked, occasionally involving masochistic actions. For example, for 12 Square Meters (1994), ≪12m2≫ (in Chinese) the accompanying photography exhibit showed him as \\"a naked man, his head half-shaved, sitting in a prison-like space. His skin was wet and covered with flies. His face looked blank but tough, as if he were trying to meditate his way through pain.\\" In a piece titled To Add One Meter to an Anonymous Mountain (1995), ≪为无名山增高一米≫ (in Chinese) he and nine other artists climbed a mountain near Beijing, stripped and lay down on top of one another to create a second, mini-peak. In another group performance called To Raise the Water Level in a Fishpond (1997), ≪为鱼塘增高水位≫ (in Chinese) he asked 40 migrant laborers to stand in a pond so that their physical presence would raise the water level. He moved to New York City in 1998. Zhang continued his naked performance art in the United States with Pilgrimage — Wind and Water in New York (1998) ≪朝拜—纽约风水≫ (in Chinese) and My America (Hard to Acclimatize) (1999). ≪我的美国 (水土不服)≫ (in Chinese) ===Sculpture=== Zhang Huan Three Heads Six Arms (2008), Hong Kong (on display May 23 – June 30, 2011) Zhang returned to China in 2006 and took up sculpture after converting to Buddhism. He also involves the body in his sculptures; his earliest sculptures were giant copper hands and feet, magnified versions of fragments of broken Buddhist figures that he found in Tibet. By using quasi- religious ritual, he seeks to discover the point at which the spiritual can manifest via the corporeal. He uses simple repetitive gestures, usually regarded as meaningless work-for-work's-sake chores. Buddhism, with its temple music, sculptures and philosophy are a prevalent theme in Zhang Huan's work. His sculpture Long Ear Ash Head (2007), ≪长耳香灰头≫ (in Chinese) for example, consists of a massive head made of incense ash and steel. It fuses the artist's image with the lengthened earlobes representing happiness and good fortune in the Buddhist religion. He continued to explore Buddhism with sculpture Sydney Buddha (2015), ≪悉尼佛≫ (in Chinese) an exhibition where two Buddha sculptures were positioned facing each other: \\"One, a headless metal statue. The other, a crumbling sculpture made from over 20 tonnes of incense ash, which was collected from Buddhist temples in Shanghai and across China’s Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces.\\" Of Sydney Buddha, the artist said: \\"The piece conveys the collective memory, soul, thoughts and prayers, and collapse of mankind. It implies a collective ineffectiveness, arising from taking action when none should be taken, upsetting the natural order of things.\\" He has exhibited at shows including the 2002 Whitney Biennial and Rituals at the Akademie der Künste in Berlin. ==Zhang Huan’s Performance Art== ===Angel (1993)=== Angel, ≪天使≫ (in Chinese) one of Zhang Huan's first performance art pieces, dates back to 1993 at the National Art Gallery located in Beijing, China. Zhang placed a giant white canvas on the floor of the exhibition space, then stepped out of the exhibition area and had a jar of red liquid (supposed to represent blood) and mangled doll parts poured over him. Afterwards, Zhang picked up the doll pieces and walked back to the exhibition space and onto the canvas, where he then tried to reassemble the doll back together on the canvas. Thom Collins described the piece in a biographical writeup for the 2004 group exhibition Witness at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Sydney: \\"This work, a startling and visceral commentary on the Chinese government mandate of abortions for women conceiving more than the legal limit of one child, led to a quick closure of the exhibition and serious censure of the artist.\\" ===12 Square Meters (1994)=== Zhang Huan grew up with the experience of living in a crowded village area. He did not have much space for himself, which impressed the idea of China's overpopulation on him at young age. In 1994, Zhang Huan was in a small village in China and needed to use a restroom after lunch. He found a public restroom just off the street and went on in. Because of a lot of rain the village had been receiving, the restroom wasn't cleaned recently due to \\"weather precautions\\". As Zhang entered the restroom he found that it reeked with awful smells and flies were everywhere in the room. This experience reminded him of his childhood and the small crowded, unclean restrooms he used when he was growing up. \\"Once I stepped in, I found myself surrounded by thousands of flies that seemed to have been disturbed by my appearance. I felt as if my body was being devoured by the flies.\\" This experience served as inspiration for the piece 12 Square Meters. \\"Zhang Huan spread on his body a visceral liquid of fish and honey to attract the flies in the public restroom in the village. He sat on the toilet, almost immobile for an hour.\\" In a matter of minutes, flies covered his body seeking the treat he slathered on himself. ===Foam (1998)=== Foam ≪泡沫≫ (in Chinese) is one of Zhang Huan's non-performance pieces, of which he has not done many. The piece consists of 15 photographs of his face where he is covered in what appears to be sea foam. In his mouth is his wife's family. ===Family Tree (2000)=== Family Tree ≪家谱≫ (in Chinese) consists of nine sequential images of Zhang Huan's face. The photographs are taken in a chronological order, from dusk to dawn. This performance piece is supposed to be a representation of Zhang's lineage. During the work, Zhang would have three calligraphers write a combination of names known to him, personal stories, learned tales and random thoughts. The calligraphers worked on his face, adding more and more during the chronological period. Eventually, his face was covered by so much calligraphy, it was hard to make out what was actually written. ===Peace (2003)=== Peace ≪和平≫ (in Chinese) is another non-performance art work that Zhang Huan did in order to create a symbolic self-portrait of himself. Again, in order to pay respect to his ancestors, Huan had the bell inscribed with names from eight generations of his ancestors. The bell itself is Tibetan inspired by small bells used in ritual practices. In order to ring the bell, Zhang had a real-life cast made of himself, and hung just a few feet from the bell. The cast version of himself is supposed to represent the compassion that is the necessary counterpart for wisdom. The actual act of ring the bell is supposed to represent the \\"artistic struggle with the circumstances of and inheritance from family is both necessarily violent and richly generative.\\" ==Selected solo exhibitions== * 1988 Henan University, Kaifeng * 1999 Max Protetch Gallery, New York * 2000 Cotthem Gallery, Barcelona * 2001 Galerie Albert Benamou, Paris * 2002 Kunstverein in Hamburg * 2003 Bochum Museum, Bochum * 2004 Norton Museum of Art, Florida * 2005 Museum of Fine Arts, Boston * 2006 Sherman Galleries, Sydney * 2007 Haunch of Venison, London * 2008 Shanghai Art Museum, Shanghai * 2009 Haunch of Venison, Zürich * 2011 Blum & Poe, Los Angeles * 2012 Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto * 2013 Palazzo Vecchio, Forte di Belvedere, Firenze * 2014 Pace London, Spring Poppy Fields == References == ==Further reading== *Shing-Kwan Chan, \\"Public Displays of Affliction: On Zhang Huan’s 12m2\\", Yishu: Journal of Contemporary Chinese Art, Volume 17, Number 1, January/February 2018, https://yishu-online.com/browse- articles/?932 *Elena Geuna, Zhang Huan: Ashman, 24 ORE Cultura, Milan 2010, *Yilmaz Dziewior, RoseLee Goldberg and Robert Storr, Zhang Huan, Phaidon Press, London, 2009, *Melissa Chiu, Kong Bu, Eleanor Heartney and Vishakha Desai, Zhang Huan: Altered States, Charta, Milan, 2007 *Mark Gisbourne, Zhang Huan: Drawings, Schirmer/Mosel, Munich, 2007 *Michele Robecchi, Conversations with Photographers: Zhang Huan, La Fabrica, Madrid, 2005, ==External links== *Official web site *The Pace Gallery *Zhang Huan at 88MoCCA - The Museum of Chinese contemporary art on the web *Zhang Huan at the Saatchi Gallery *Artcore profile *China Daily - The avant-garde art goes too far? *Zhang Huan at Louis Lannoo Gallery *Zhang Huan at artnet.com *Last chance to see the Sydney Buddha ===Video=== *Zhang Huan video Category:1965 births Category:Living people Category:Chinese performance artists Category:Chinese contemporary artists Category:Central Academy of Fine Arts alumni Category:People from Anyang Category:Painters from Henan Category:Chinese photographers Category:Chinese sculptors ","title":"Zhang Huan"},{"id":"3235707","text":"Sugarcreek Township is one of the twelve townships of Greene County, Ohio, United States.

In 1824, he explored the Finlay River and its tributaries in present-day north-central British Columbia, including the Muskwa, Omineca and Stikine for the HBC, his journals later published by the Hudson's Bay Record Society in 1955. ==Early life and career== Black was born in Tyrie, Aberdeenshire, Scotland, the oldest and only son to John Black, from the parish on Tyrie, and Mary Leith, from the parish of Bodichell. Black also had two sisters, Ann and Mary. His baptism was witnessed by George Leith and Janet Black. It is noted in the baptism record that Black was \\"illegitimate,\\" though, on June 24, 1781, John Black and Mary Leith are noted in the parish marriage records in Pitsligo as \\"having been contracted and claimed were married\\" prior to the birth of Samuel. Black's father died four years after Black's birth. Black came to Lower Canada (present day Quebéc) in 1802 in the service of the XY Company as a clerk, perhaps encouraged by his maternal uncle and fur trader, George Leith, and probably joined the firm of Leith, Jamieson and Company, part of the XYC. He already had relatives living in Canada at the time of his arrival. At the joining of the XYC and NWC in 1804, Black \\"passed with the Company's organisation,\\" and went to work for the North West Company, headquartered in Montreal. Assigned to work in the Athabasca Department (mostly in present-day Alberta) in 1805, Black served as a clerk there for fifteen years. For much of this time, he took an active role in the sometimes violent competition between the NWC and the HBC. In 1816, Black was made Wintering Partner.McGillvary, Simon. (1988). The North West Company in rebellion: Simon McGillivray's Fort William notebook, 1815. Jean Morrison, ed. Thunder Bay: Thunder Bay Historical Museum Society. By 1820, Black's violent activities against Hudson's Bay Company employees had so imperiled his safety that he withdrew across the Rockies to the North West Company fort at McLeod Lake in New Caledonia, as an arrest had been sworn out for him. At the merger of the NWC and HBC in 1821, Black violent opposition against the HBC caused him to be one of the few NWC men not included in the merger. But in 1823, Black was appointed as a clerk and then Chief Trader to the post at Fort St. John. ==Explorations== In the summer of 1824, at the behest of Sir George Simpson, governor of the Hudson's Bay Company, Black was assigned to set out with a crew of ten from Rocky Mountain Portage (now Hudson's Hope) \\"to the Sources of Finlay's Branch [the Finlay River] and Northwest Ward.\\" The purpose of the expedition was to assess the region's suitability for extension of the fur trade, and to check the advance of the Russian fur trade from the west. The river had been partially explored by John Finlay, a colleague of Alexander Mackenzie, in 1797. In 1793, Mackenzie had ascended the Peace River to the point where it is formed by the Finlay flowing from the north, and the Parsnip River from the south. Mackenzie had taken the Parsnip, and from there completed a complicated route to the Pacific Ocean. It is thought that Finlay may have decided to probe the northern branch of the Peace in order to determine if it afforded a better route to the Pacific than the one taken by Mackenzie. Nonetheless, it would appear from the information Black had that Finlay had only made it as far as the Ingenika River, about 130 km north of the Finlay River's confluence with the Parsnip (where the Peace begins). The journey up the Finlay River's 450 km length and up its tributaries, the Toodoggone River and the Firesteel River, took Black and his men to what is considered the ultimate source of the Mackenzie River at Thutade Lake (at the head of the Firesteel). Proceeding sometimes on foot, sometimes by raft, Black and a smaller crew explored the region of the Spatsizi Plateau, there finding one of the sources of the Stikine River and so reaching the boundary between the Arctic and Pacific drainages. Journeying north-eastward, Black crossed another divide — this time between the Stikine and Liard Rivers — and rafted some way down the Kechika by way of its tributary, the Turnagain River, before returning again down the Finlay. Black's vivid journal account of the expedition conveys the extreme hardships faced by the crew, and what Black believed was the general privation of the country — both as a source of food and of furs. Two of his men deserted in the course of the expedition, giving Deserters Canyon its name. The river proved to be a rough and difficult traverse, and Black's assessment was that this fact — coupled with what he perceived to be the general absence of marketable furs or a healthy First Nations population — made the territory impracticable for the extension of the fur trade or as a northern route to the Pacific. Nonetheless, Black and his crew had completed an extraordinarily extensive survey of what is now north-central British Columbia. They had not only journeyed to the source of the Mackenzie River, but had traveled over the Arctic-Pacific divide, and to the sources of two major watersheds — the Stikine and Liard. ==Later career== After an interval at Fort Dunvegan and York Factory, Black was appointed Chief Factor of Fort Nez Percés (near present-day Wallula, Washington) in 1825. This posting allowed Black to exercise his renowned vigour in opposing competition, in this instance from American traders. His difficulties in maintaining a good relationship with the local Nez Perce clients led to Black's transfer to the company's Thompson's River Post (now Kamloops) in 1830. In 1837, Black was appointed as Chief Factor in charge of the inland posts of the Columbia. Here Black was murdered on February 8, 1841, shot by a nephew of Chief Tranquille of the local group of Secwepemc (Shuswap) following a minor quarrel.Bancroft, H.H. (1884).

Dover Publications, New York. p. 91-95. He is interred near Kamloops. ==Places named for Black== *The Finlay River was locally called Black's River by early fur traders, but the Hudson's Bay Company had inadvertently filed Black's journals under John Finlay's name, fixing his name as the name of the river Black traversed. *The fur trader and explorer John McLeod re-located the river that Black discovered (the Kechika) and named it Black's River; however, the Canadian government officially recorded the name as the Kechika. *The Samuel Black Range lies between the Toodoggone and Firesteel Rivers. *Black Lake is a small lake on the south- western side of the Samuel Black Range. ==References== ==External links== *A brief but thorough synopsis of Black's life and career by George Woodcock, published on the Royal British Columbia Museum website. *An account of Black's expedition and a modern partial re-tracing of his route is to be found in R.M.

Note the orange bill. Harris's sparrow (Zonotrichia querula) is a large sparrow. Their breeding habitat is the north part of central Canada (primarily the Northwest Territories and Nunavut, ranging slightly into northern Manitoba and Saskatchewan), making it Canada's only endemic breeding bird. In the winter they migrate to the Great Plains states of the United States, from southern South Dakota to central Texas. The common name of this species commemorates the American amateur ornithologist Edward Harris (1799-1863). ==Description== This species is the largest of the sparrows in the family Passerellidae, though other superficially dissimilar species in the family may slightly exceed them in size. They range in total length from , with a wingspan and weigh from . Among standard measurements, the wing chord is , the tail is , the bill is and the tarsus is . This is a very distinctive looking species. Breeding plumage birds have conspicuous pink bills and black on the crown, face, throat and upper breast, contrasting with grey on the sides of the head and neck. The back is brown, overlaid with heavy black streaking. There are two white wing bars. Breeding birds have white lower underparts with some black mottling on flanks. Non-breeding adults are more buffy than grey and brown, with reduced or absent black markings and often have whitish scalloping on the head and throat. Immatures have less black than all adult plumages, normally marked with a white chin and throat, a black malar stripe and a broad smudgy black breast- band. Juveniles have a brownish crown streaked with black and fine dark streaks and some broader black markings on the underside. Birds moult from July to September. Confusion of wintering birds is possible with the winter Lapland longspur (Calcarius lapponicus) but that species is much shorter- tailed with white outer rectrices, has rich rufous in greater coverts, and is strictly terrestrial on open ground. The song of the Harris's sparrow is usually delivered from a high perch. The song consists of a series of one or more clear high wavering whistles followed by another series in higher or lower pitch. They have also been known to call out a strong, metallic chink, as well as some variable musical twittering. ==Habitat== The Harris's sparrow breeds in stunted coniferous forests and adjacent scrubs, especially areas of the grand boreal forests where stands of spruce abut mossy bogs. They often nest near the northern limit of tree growth in the forest-tundra ecotone. Typical plant life in the breeding grounds consist of white and black spruce (Picea glauca and P. mariana) and American larch (Larix laricina), dwarf birch-willow, and wet sedge meadow and shrubby tundra with dwarf ericad/lichen plant life.Timoney, K. P., G. H. La Roi, S. C. Zoltai, and A. L. Robinson. 1992. The high subarctic forest-tundra of northwestern Canada: position, width, and vegetation gradients in relation to climate. Arctic 45:1-9. The species migrates mainly through tallgrass prairies to winter in open woodlands, woodland edges and clearings, hedgerows, dense riparian thickets and around brush piles. The Harris's sparrow regularly occurs at feeders in suburban and rural gardens during the wintertime. They typically avoid dry shortgrass prairies and dense woods during winter. Migrating sparrows may be attracted to marsh elder (Iva annua) and giant ragweed (Ambrosia trifida).Swenk, M. H. and O. A. Stevens. 1929. The Harris's Sparrow and the study of it by trapping. Wilson Bulletin 41:129-177. ==Behaviour== Harris's Sparrow near Denton, Nebraska. October 2017. ===Migration=== Spring migration commences around late February with birds arriving on breeding grounds by May. Sparrows arrive on their wintering grounds as early as late October, though mostly during November and early December. Records from Banff National Park suggest Harris's sparrows use mountain valleys as migration routes.Salt, Jim R. 1998. Some bird records from Jasper National Park. Alberta Naturalist 28(4):73-74. Apparently, fall migration is less strict than spring migration as Harris's sparrows regularly wander about prairie provinces in Canada until harsh weather forces them south.Baumgartner, A. M. 1968. Harris's Sparrow. Pages 1249-1273 in Life histories of North American cardinals, grosbeaks, buntings, towhees, finches, sparrows, and their allies, part 3. Vol. 237 (Austin, Jr., O. L., Ed.) U.S. National Museum Bulletin ===Feeding ecology=== The Harris's sparrow generally feeds on the ground, scratching vigorously in the leaves and soil for food. Observed foraging during nesting was 85% ground- gleaning.Norment, C. J. 1992a. The comparative breeding ecology of the Harris's Sparrow (Zonotrichia querula) and White-crowned Sparrow (Zonotrichia leucophrys) in the Northwest Territories, Canada. Phd Thesis. University of Kansas, Lawrence. During the breeding season individuals typically forage alone or with a mate. Primary in the diet (66% of stomach contents of breeding birds) are seeds, largely of Carex sedges, grasses and Scirpus bulrush.Semple, J. B. and G. M. Sutton. 1932. Nesting of Harris's Sparrow Zonotrichia querula at Churchill, Manitoba. Auk 49:166-183. Also important in the breeding season diet are fruits, largely black crowberry (Empetrum nigrum), mountain bearberry (Arctostaphylos alpina) and various Vaccinium species. Pine needles, flower buds and blossoms are eaten supplementally. Larval invertebrates are important from June to September in the diet, as available prey becomes more common at this point. The principal preferred animal prey includes beetles, flies, bees, ants, moths, butterflies, spiders, cicadas, aphids and leafhoppers. The diet of wintering Harris's sparrow is less well-known and has not been quantitatively studied. ===Sociality=== Males of this species often group together to sing at dusk. In winter flocks, Harris's sparrows maintain linear dominance hierarchies that determine access to food and roost sites. The most dominant birds are the oldest males which usually also have the largest bibs. \\"Jump fights\\" between males occasionally occur, consisting of birds facing off, then leaping at each other, pecking, clawing and beating each other with wings. Testosterone alone does not affect the dominance status of winter birds. If first winter birds have their feathers dyed black, creating an artificially large bib, they rise in the dominance hierarchy past females and other young males.Rohwer, S. and J. C. Wingfield. 1981. A field study of social dominance, plasma levels of luteinizing hormone and steroid hormones in wintering Harris's Sparrows. Zeitschrift für Tierpsychologie 57(2):173-183. It is usually found in flocks up to several dozen in winter, individuals regularly wandering outside of the \\"normal\\" range and turning up in flocks of other sparrow species. ===Reproduction=== Breeding pairs establish a territory of about .Norment, C. J. & S. A. Shackleton. 1993. \\"Harris' Sparrow (Zonotrichia querula)\\". In Birds of North America, No. 64 (A. Poole & F. Gill, eds.) Philadelphia: The Academy of Natural Sciences; Washington, DC: The American Ornithologists' Union. Nests are usually constructed in early to mid- June. Eggs are usually laid by late June to July, depending on when snow in their habitat completely melts.Rees, W. R. 1973. Comparative ecology of three sympatric species of Zonotrichia PhD Thesis. University of Toronto, Toronto. In this species, nests are placed in a well-hidden spot on the ground underneath a thick bush or small conifer or in mossy depression in thick grass clumps. Both parents build a cup nest out of twigs, grass, moss and lichens and line it with fine grasses. From three to five eggs are laid, being variably greenish or greyish in colour with differing degrees of small reddish-brown spot. Eggs average in size and weigh approximately . The incubation stage lasts for approximately 13.5 days. The chicks weigh about upon hatching. The young will fledge in about 8 to 10 days, from July 4 to July 13. About 3 weeks after fledging, the young become independent of their parents.Norment, C. 2003. Patterns of Nestling feeding in Harris’s Sparrows, Zonorichia querula and White-crowned Sparrows, Z. leucophyrs, in the Northwest Territories, Canada. Canadian Field-Naturalist, 117: 203-208. Second clutches may be laid if the first is destroyed, usually prolonging the brooding period a further three days for the parent sparrows. The species is arguably the least studied North American sparrow due to its isolated nesting territory. The first nest ever found was discovered 1931 in Churchill, Manitoba by ornithologist George M. Sutton, 91 years after the species was initially described.Cornell Lab of Ornithology ==Longevity and mortality== The Harris's sparrow has lived for up to 11 years and 8 months in the wild. Predators on the nest can including varied terrestrial mammals, including Arctic ground squirrels (Spermophilus parryii) and stoats (Mustela erminea).Norment, C. J. 1992b. Comparative breeding biology of Harris's Sparrows (Zonotrichia querula) and Gambel's White-crowned Sparrows (Zonotrichia leucophrys gambelii) in the Northwest Territories, Canada. Condor 94:955-975. Harris's sparrows provide an easy target for these predators due to the location of their nests on the ground. Canada jays (Perisoreus canadensis), northern shrikes (Lanius excubitor) and merlins (Falco columbarius) can be a serious predators at the nest (including both nestlings and adults). Shrikes, sharp-shinned hawks (Accipiter striatus) and great horned owls (Bubo virginianus) are known predators of wintering Harris's sparrows. As an anti-predator adaptation, Harris's sparrows fly up into trees when startled by other animals, usually issuing an alarm call in the process (weenk). They duck down to the ground when threatened by other birds. They also produce alarm calls when threatened to alert others. ==Conservation status== This species is classified as being of least concern by the IUCN. The total population is estimated at 3.7 million individuals. However, the species came to be included on the \\"Audubon Watchlist\\" because there appears to have been a decline in the number of birds observed in annual Christmas Bird Counts across North America. The species is fairly adaptable in wintering habitat and feeding opportunities and its habitat is isolated enough to be out of reach for heavy human development, which makes the recent declines something of a mystery. The species breeds on the northern edge of boreal forests and it is possible that habitat change in their breeding range is affecting this sparrow. The boreal forest, beyond heavy logging, has been adversely affected by increased wildfire and declining soil quality, both of which are likely correlated to global climate change.Kasischke, E. S., Christensen Jr, N. L., & Stocks, B. J. (1995). Fire, global warming, and the carbon balance of boreal forests. Ecological Applications, 437-451.Goulden, M. L., Wofsy, S. C., Harden, J.

Before Ming Dynasty, Tianzi Mountain was known as \\"Qingyan Mountain\\" for green stones. The mountain is named after the early Ming dynasty's farmer Xiang Dakun of the Tujia ethnic group, who led a successful local farmers' revolt and called himself \\"Xiang Wang Tianzi\\", meaning son of Heaven and is the traditional epithet of the Chinese emperor. The highest pillar of Tianzi Mountain is Kunlun Peak with an elevation of 1,262.5 metersHu Min. and the lowest pillar is Shilanyu with an elevation of 534 meters. ==Origin of the name== Before the Ming Dynasty, Tianzi Mountain was named \\"Qingyan Mountain\\" together with Zhangjiajie. According to a legend of the Tujia people, Xiang Dakun, who was dissatisfied with the government at that time, went to \\"Qingyan Mountain\\" in 1353, with the help of Li Boru, he rebelled and established a regime, and assumed the title of \\"Xiang Wang Tianzi\\". As Xiang representd the interests of all ethnic groups, mainly the Tujia, he was supported by the local people, and established a fortress with \\"Tianzi Mountain\\" as its axis. In 1385, Xiang's regime was fiercely besieged by more than ten thousand elite soldiers commanded by Hongwu Emperor, outnumbered and defeated, Xiang Dakun died in the battle and fell into the Shentang Gulf. Since then, the local people have named the places where he fought and lived as \\"Tianzi\\" in his memory. The Qing dynasty used various repressive measures to forcibly abolish the word \\"Tianzi\\", but the Tujia people have always called it \\"Tianzi Mountain\\". == Size == These giant, pillar-like mountains have a peak of . The area taken up by these mountains is about . == Formation == The Mountains are quartz sandstone and were formed about 400 million years ago through irregular rising patterns of the earths crust, and with about 318 million years of erosion these tall and skinny mountains were formed. This geological formation belongs to the \\"New Cathaysian\\" tectonic system. == Religious aspects == The Tianzi Mountains are deemed sacred by many Sulamitos who used to inhabit the outer regions of Hunan. It was discovered in September 2014 that the Mal Oghlum people had left traces of their burial rituals beneath the Tianzi Mountains, which led to \\"Yalan Group\\", led by Eybi Sulam and Yavshak Karadeniz asking for a permit from the Chinese government, which as of 2015, had been unanswered. == Tourism == Tourists find this place very popular and are always visiting. During certain months of the year, mainly after it rains, the Tianzi Mountains are covered in a sea of fog where most pictures look stunning, as seen above. July is the hottest month of the year where temperatures can reach the mid to upper and it also rains the most during the hotter times of the year. Even though July can be very warm, during the winter months temperatures drop to about . ==Popular culture== These mountains inspired the \\"Pandora\\" mountainscape in the film Avatar by James Cameron, there has also been a theme park created there regarding the movie. ==References== Category:Zhangjiajie Category:Mountains of Hunan ","title":"Tianzi Mountain"},{"id":"3235740","text":"Atherstone was a rural district in the administrative county of Warwickshire, England, from 1894 to 1974.

In contrast with its East Coast, West Coast and Southern counterparts, Midwest hip hop has very few constants in style or production. Midwest hip hop's first dose of national popularity came in the mid-90s with the extremely fast-paced rappers known as Choppers, such as Bone Thugs-n-Harmony (Cleveland), Twista (Chicago), Tech N9ne (Kansas City), Atmosphere (Minneapolis), and Eminem (Detroit). However, while the artists mentioned above became one of the first to introduce Midwest hip hop that rivaled the popularity of West and East Coast styles, other subsequent acts have or already had also risen to national prominence such as Nelly, D12, Common, Da Brat, Chief Keef, Kanye West, Kid Cudi, Big Sean, Juice Wrld, Metro Boomin, and Chance the Rapper but they share very few similarities. Other notable midwest rappers and producers include: Brother Ali, Lupe Fiasco, Royce Da 5'9, J Dilla, Ramey Dawoud, Tech N9ne, Elzhi, Obie Trice, and up and comers Freddie Gibbs, Danny Brown and Manny Phesto. It is because these lack of constants between acts from different cities (and sometimes even between artists from the same city) that it can be extremely difficult to define a \\"typical\\" Midwest sound. One characteristic of Midwest hip hop is that tempos typically range from 90 to 180 beats per minute, whereas the tempos in East Coast, West Coast, and Southern hip hop typically do not exceed 120 bpm.AudioSparx: Midwest Hip Hop and Rap == Michigan == Detroit hip hop began to gain traction the late 1980s with artists like D The Great, Detroit's Most Wanted, Suavey Spy, Mike Fresh, Ace Lee, Eveready Crew, Esham, J to The D, and Silveree. Slum Village emerged from the hip hop scene in Detroit in the mid-1990s. Their first album, Fantastic, Vol. 1 came out in 1997. The producer was J Dilla, who also produced for notable hip-hop acts from around the country, including The Pharcyde, Common, and A Tribe Called Quest. He would later become one of the most sought-after producers in hip-hop, with many of his beats being used posthumously after his death in 2006. A popular place for rap battles in Detroit is the Hip Hop Shop, located on W 7 Mile. Despite Detroit being over 85% African American, many of the most famous white rappers, including Eminem, Insane Clown Posse, Kid Rock and Twiztid are from the Detroit area. Trick Trick is widely known and recognized as an important figure in Detroit's underground hip hop scene. In the mid-1990s, Eminem gained notoriety in Detroit as a battle rapper, and released an album during the early stages of his underground career. Infinite was sold out of the trunk of his car. It struggled to sell or create a buzz despite his success in the battling scene. Angry but determined, Eminem developed his style and recorded The Slim Shady EP, released in 1997. When Em traveled to Los Angeles to compete in the 1997 Rap Olympics, he placed in 2nd, and his EP got into the hands of Dr. Dre, who immediately wanted to sign him. He signed to Dr. Dre's Aftermath Entertainment, and in 1999 he released his major-label debut album The Slim Shady LP. The album reached #2 on the Billboard 200 charts and began Eminem's period of commercial success lasting from 1999 until the present. Eminem has become the best-selling hip hop artist of all time and the best- selling artist of the 2000s, thereby making him one of the most significant artists to emerge from the Midwest hip hop scene. Eminem founded the label imprint Shady Records in 1999. He was a member of the Detroit rap group D12 (standing for \\"Dirty Dozen\\") and signed them to his label, they would go on to release two successful albums in the early 2000s. Rapper Proof was also part of the group. Alongside his success with D12, he also released two solo albums, I Miss The Hip Hop Shop and Searching for Jerry Garcia.Searching for Jerry Garcia On April 11, 2006, he was fatally shot in a gunfight at a Detroit nightclub.Lawrence Van Gelder, Arts Briefly: Another Death in Shooting At Detroit Nightclub, The New York Times, April 19, 2006. Fellow D12 member Bizarre, also from Detroit, would go on to a solo career as well, having released three solo albums as of 2018. Mr. Porter (previously known as Kon Artis) was also a member of D12, and has had a significant solo career as a producer, producing solo instrumental projects as well as songs for notable artists such as 50 Cent, Snoop Dogg and Eminem. Eminem also signed Detroit rapper Obie Trice to Shady Records. Trice released his debut album Cheers on the label, followed by Second Round's on Me. In 2008, Trice left the label to found his own Black Market Entertainment, on which he would release two further albums. In 2011, Trice met with Michigan State Senator Virgil Smith, Jr. in order to discuss potential initiatives to help develop the youth talent of Detroit.Gary, Kevin S..

He began as an underground rapper, and featured on Eminem's album The Slim Shady LP in 1999. In 2002 he released his debut album, Rock City (named after Detroit); he has gone on to release several successful albums. In addition to his solo career, Royce is known for his membership in the hip hop supergroup Slaughterhouse from 2008 to 2018, and in collaboration with DJ Premier as PRhyme. Royce and Eminem also work as a duo under the moniker Bad Meets Evil, and in 2011 released the EP Hell: The Sequel, which reached #1 on the Billboard 200. Blade Icewood gained respect as one of Detroit's premier rappers, but was gunned down and murdered in 2005, after his first shooting which left him paralyzed from his chest down. He had a beef for some time with the Eastside Chedda Boyz, a hip hop group from Detroit's east neighborhoods. There was a dispute over the name Chedda Boyz because Blade Icewood claimed that name originated on the west side of the city. MC Breed, from Flint, is most known for his songs \\"Ain't No Future in Yo Frontin'\\" and \\"Gotta Get Mine\\" featuring Tupac Shakur. He was on life support for two days in September 2008 after he collapsed during a game of pick-up basketball due to kidney failure. It is unclear if prior health complications were the cause of his death later that year. Another rapper from Flint, Jon Connor, is quickly climbing the rap ladder, has been featured in The Source, and has collaborated with many big names in the rap industry. In 1993, Ira Dorsey and Raheen Peterson met through their younger brothers. The two began writing together, under the names Bootleg and Shoestring, and created their first song, \\"Dope Dayton Ave.\\" Rapper Matt Hinkle soon joined the duo under the name Backstabba. The group began working with local producer Steve Pitts and formed The Dayton Family, named after Dayton Street, one of the most crime-ridden streets in their hometown of Flint, Michigan. In between studio sessions, they performed at local clubs and quickly gained notoriety within Flint. The Dayton Family recorded a 12-inch single and soon signed with Atlanta independent record label Po' Broke in 1995. That year, the group released their debut album What's on My Mind? and were featured on No Limits Down South Hustlers: Bouncin' and Swingin' compilation album, which got the trio recognition throughout Southern United States. After the album's release, Hinkle was imprisoned and replaced by Dorsey's younger brother Eric, who performed under the name Ghetto E. Following a year of touring, the group left Po' Broke due to legal problems with the label's producer. In 1996, they released their second album, F.B.I., standing for Fuck Being Indicted, under Relativity Records. The album was later certified gold. The Dayton Family was plagued with various legal problems, including Ira being incarcerated soon after the release of F.B.I., which hindered the amount of work the group released. Both Ira and Peterson released solo albums. Two years later, the group signed with Detroit rapper Esham's Gothom label and released solo albums. The next year, they released Welcome to the Dopehouse under Koch Records. Big Sean, from Detroit's west side, steadily rose to fame with his mixtapes. In 2007, he was signed to Kanye West's GOOD Music label, and in 2008, Def Jam Recordings. Since then he has had mainstream success. He released Finally Famous in 2011. His mixtape released in September 2012, titled Detroit (mixtape), was called the mixtape of the year. Hall of Fame was released August 27, 2013. In February 2015, he released his third studio album Dark Sky Paradise, becoming his first number 1 album as it debuted atop the Billboard 200. Nick Speed is another standout in Detroit music, producing for 50 Cent and Danny Brown. In 2013 he released The Beat Down on vinyl and produced A.R.T. the DIA project for legendary Detroit emcee Seven the General, which would be nominated for two Detroit Music Awards with the song \\"Detroit City Blues\\" by Seven the General ft. Guilty Simpson and Bizarre going on to become the official promo song for the annual Detroit Design Festival. Other successful Michigan rappers include Danny Brown, Esham, the duo Insane Clown Posse, the group Twiztid, rapper Seth Patrick,and rapper Xzibit. In 2014, as a part of the Shady Records collaboration album Shady XV, the single \\"Detroit vs. Everybody\\" was released. The single featured a range of rappers from Detroit including Royce da 5'9\\", Big Sean, Danny Brown, Eminem, Trick-Trick and Dej Loaf; and has been described as \\"a rap rally cry for the Motor City\\". == Illinois == === Chicago === Chicago has harbored several locally popular acts since the early 1990s, including Do or Die and Crucial Conflict; the former being a fast-rapping group associated with Twista, and the latter of which was a group with a decidedly down-home, country sound. Chicago soon became known for more than fast rapping with the rising popularity of Common Sense (now known as simply \\"Common\\"), protege of producer No I.D., who put flippant battle raps over a jazzy backdrop. Other rappers in this vein included Vakill, who also gained some notoriety in Chicago. Da Brat, a Chicago native, also had a hit in this period with Jermaine Dupri's label So So Def. In 2004, Chicago producer and rapper Kanye West broke the scene with his multi platinum debut, The College Dropout on Roc-A-Fella Records. He became an industry commodity, reworking and repopularizing Wu-Tang producer RZA's style of speeding up Soul instrumental and vocal samples to fit hip hop beats. The style became known as \\"chipmunk soul\\". The same year, West produced two hits for Twista, \\"Slow Jamz\\" and \\"Overnight Celebrity\\"; these led to the rapper's first platinum release, Kamikaze. In 2005, Common (having dropped the \\"Sense\\" from his name) signed with Kanye's GOOD Music, West also being a student of No I.D. This led to Be, Common's second gold album. West attempted to push longtime associate Rhymefest, a Chicago battle rapper and ghostwriter; his support helped carve the MC a local niche and some national attention. A guest spot on West's 2006 second album, Late Registration, also solidified the buzz of up-and-coming Chicago rapper Lupe Fiasco, whose debut album Food & Liquor was the No. 1 rap album in the country upon its release. His later album The Cool directly references his Chicago roots. Chicago is currently home to a thriving underground rap-music scene. Blogs such as Fake Shore Drive, SBG (See Beyond Genre), and Midwest Live have become a \\"vital nerve center\\" for the local underground rap music scene. A 2009 film, I Am Hip Hop: The Chicago Hip Hop Documentary documented the underground rap-music scene in Chicago from 2004–2009. In 2009, the song \\"Legendary\\" was released by Chicago rappers Saurus and Bones, Twista, and AK-47 of Do or Die showcasing the Midwest style of fast lyrics over a dark beat. Kevin Beacham a.k.a. Formless compiled and wrote \\"The Chicago Hip Hop Story\\" which is featured on the website of Chicago- based hip hop record label Galapagos4. === Other Illinois hip hop artists === Champaign, Illinois is the home of Christian hip hop group Hostyle Gospel. The group is best known for contributing an aggressive militant approach to Christian hip hop, called Christian battle music. K.Flay is a hip hop artist from Wilmette, Illinois. She is best known for her billboard hit Life As A Dog which charted 133 on the Billboard 200, 14 on the Top R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums chart and number 2 on Nielsen SoundScan Top Heatseekers chart. == Ohio == === Cleveland === Bizzy Bone of Bone Thugs & Harmony – live in concert In the early 1990s, five drop outs formed the unit Bone Enterpri$e and took a one way bus ticket to Compton. They went searching for Eazy-E, a pioneer of gangsta rap, and signed to his label. They were signed to Ruthless when they got back to Cleveland for a concert, where they performed for Eazy on the spot. They changed their name to Bone Thugs-n-Harmony consisting of Flesh-N-Bone, Layzie Bone, Wish Bone, Krayzie Bone, Bizzy Bone. While in L.A. they visited The Good Life where they bore witness to the creators of their soon to be new style, a rapid-fire flow and melodic mesh of harmonizing vocals, called Chopping, that they called the Flow Motion. They released their LP Creepin on ah Come Up with the smash single \\"Thuggish Ruggish Bone\\" and \\"Foe tha Love of $\\" featuring Eazy-E. They later had hits like \\"1st of Tha Month\\", \\"Tha Crossroads\\", Art of War's \\"Look Into My Eyes\\", and \\"If I Could Teach The World\\" which earned the group their first American Music Awards. Bone Thugs-n-Harmony were the first Midwest rappers to go platinum, which led to a conflict with Chicago rappers as Twista, Do or Die, and Crucial Conflict about stealing their style. They are also the only ones to collaborate with hip hop \\"Hall of Famers\\" like The Notorious B.I.G. (\\"Notorious Thugs\\"), Tupac Shakur (\\"Thug Luv\\"), Big Pun (\\"When I Die\\"), and Eazy-E (\\"Foe tha Love of $\\") while they were all living, and have sold more than 40 million records only in the U.S. Today they have their own label after contractual difficulties with Ruthless records. Their most recent album, Uni5: The World's Enemy was released in May 2010. They returned as a full group with this album after 10 years of Flesh-n-Bone being in jail, and Bizzy Bone leaving the group twice to build companies 7th Sign Records and IMG Recordings and Distribution, inc.http://www.imgrecordings.com In 2008, most Northeast Ohio (NEO) Hip-Hop has either a faux-southern sound (usually from inner city Cleveland/Akron), while Youngstown (on the PA Line) preserves a more classic vibe. However, both the Eastern and Western sides of Cleveland itself hold light to a conscious Hip Hop sound coined by artists such as Mos Def and Talib Kweli, while the southern portion of the city holds more to a flashier, more glamorous side of hip hop. Cleveland was named as xxlmag.com top ten hip hop cities, with Ohio being named among America's most hip-hop states, and having the full support of Cleveland Cavaliers star small forward LeBron James's imprint, DeamLife Ent., Cleveland and the whole Northeast Ohio music scene has shown itself as a force in Midwest as well as mainstream hip-hop. Cleveland remains on the scene with Kid Cudi, who collaborates with a wide array of musicians, Machine Gun Kelly, who signed with Diddy in August 2011, and other notables, such as Chip Tha Ripper, (also known King Chip) Ray Cash. === Cincinnati === Many well-known hip-hop artists hail from the southern Ohio city. One of the first was Jibri the Wise One whose 1991 single \\"The House the Dog Built\\" gained national airplay on radio and music video programs. Hi-Tek, Kenny P, Mr. Dibbs, Mood, OTR Clique, Five Deez, Boom Bip, Tanya Morgan, Odd Nosdam, Cincinnatiboogotti, Dose One and more of the artists that have gained international prominence.

The Grind Family was a rap group with around eight members (two from Gary, three from East Chicago, three from Hammond), led by Will Scrilla (who had a relatively successful underground solo career), dubbed \\"The Midwest Wu-tang\\", after releasing two underground tapes, the group dissolved after Will Scrilla was incarcerated on murder charges in 1999. Another infamous Gary, Indiana rap trio called CCA released multiple hits that resonated among the streets of Gary, including \\"Concord Affiliated\\" and \\"Street Life\\", their success was also short lived as all three members were incarcerated for cocaine trafficking and controlling a criminal enterprise. MCGz (Murder Capital Gangsters) another group was one of the first groups from the city of Gary to release physical CD's, the group also dissolved due to gang injunctions. The late 1990s era of Gary rap was highly regarded and talented but often short lived due to the reality of each rapper's street life. Ric Jilla of Hammond bridged the gap between rap groups like Grind Family and CCA to more modern solo artists, collaborating with the likes of Will Scrilla and Freddie Gibbs, after dropping his hit \\"Pride of Indiana\\" he began frequently touring and garnered a large local fan base. Freddie Gibbs began attracting attention in 2008 after his \\"Live From Gary, Indiana part 2\\" mixtape, as of today he's the most popular Gary rapper to become mainstream. Despite accusations of falsifying his gangster lifestyle, he has gone on to release multiple albums and EP's, including three tapes with legendary west coast producer Madlib. He was once signed to Young Jeezy's CTE label, but has left due to disagreements. The Gatekeepers compilation CD was a huge deal in launching the careers of some of Gary's hottest MC's. First Battallion, Father Tyme, Pdot (of Money Baggz Ent), T-Lo G, to name a few. == Topeka == Topeka, Kansas in the late 1980s brewed the Gucci Crew led by Carlos Steele and Vandon Rios whom had minor success locally doing television commercials that extended into Kansas City creating a buzz for a city that was primarily known for its civil rights. DVS Mindz was a popular local outfit that opened for dozens of superstar acts, and received considerable praise for its 2000 debut Million Dolla Broke Niggaz. Emcee N.I.C.E. Topeka would later produce a notable rapper, Aulsondro \\"Novelist\\" Hamilton Emcee N.I.C.E. who would go on to appear on many recordings as a lead vocalist named Novelist for the group KansasCali and star in an urban family animated cartoon series called Da Jammies.

Novelist is now currently Emcee N.I.C.E. with a new release entitled \\"Life of The Party\\" (Dance Remix) that features iconic and controversial actress Stacey Dash & Jus Blake. == Milwaukee == Milwaukee hip hop dates back to the late 1980s. Until the end of the 1990s, the Milwaukee scene was largely confined to the city’s North Side. However, as members of the hip hop generation began to attend college in the early 2000s, cultural organizations at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee began to invite acts such as Talib Kweli to perform on the East Side campus. The success of these shows led to local groups with similar followings, such as Black Surreal, Black Elephant, Frontline, Dredknox and Rusty P’s being booked for on-campus sets as well. This, in turn, opened the door for the local acts to play off- campus venues on the East Side such as Onopa (now Stonefly) Shank Hall, Up & Under and BBC that had previously been off limits to hip hop (presumably due to the stereotypes associated with such crowds). Meanwhile, Memphis club music was rapidly finding its way to Milwaukee’s North Side via Southern transplants and North Siders who either had relatives and/or attended college in the area. During this time Coo Coo Cal, who had a more typical Midwestern quick-tongued style (albeit, with a noticeably slower delivery) enjoyed moderate commercial success with his debut single “My Projects” and the follow-up “How Does It Feel” which Manager/artist at the time CEO and FOUNDER OF IMG RECORDINGS RICK ROBINSON pka DOUBLE R from the BIZZY BONE presents DOUBLE R 2002.http://www.imgrecordings.com and https://www.amazon.com/Bizzy-Bone- Presents-Double-R/dp/B0000CD5JN The result is a more artistically driven scene that is centered on the East Side, and a more commercially driven scene that is centered on the North Side. The East Side scene is characterized by socially and politically charged lyrics, neo-soul influences and the relatively common use of live instrumentation. Conversely, the North Side scene is characterized by its gritty lyrics, southern club music influences and willingness to follow commercial trends. Acts such as Rico Love, and Gerald Walker have had (or been featured on) moderately successful singles and mixtapes in recent years. Streetz-n-Young Deuces, 2006 Get 'Em Magazine Award Winners, have gained national support with the release of their mixtapes. 88.9 Radio Milwaukee has acknowledged several hip hop artists during their Milwaukee Music Awards including artists such as ¡¡OYE!! Klassik, and Prophetic. For the past several years, Milwaukee has hosted a local event called The Miltown Beatdown which served as a beat showcase/battle for local area producers. This has been another tool that has helped to join the North and East side styles together. Milwaukee is also the founding city of the largest DJ organization in the world, The Core DJ's (founder, Milwaukee native & DJ, Tony Neal). == Minneapolis – St. Paul == Although strictly underground, there existed a subterranean hip hop culture in the Twin Cities starting as early as 1981. Similar to the development of hip hop in the South Bronx, Twin Cities rap started as humble parties with a DJ and an emcee. A DJ named Travitron was comparable to the DJ Kool Herc of the Twin Cities area. Shows took place at many venues, most notoriously Club Hip Hop on Selby Avenue in St. Paul. Other artists and DJs include Disco T, Verb X, Brother Jules, Delite, and Truth Maze. The first real album to come out of the Twin Cities was called The I.R.M. Crew, released in 1985. Graffiti and b-boy crews were also existent in the city. This is the world that the current movers of Twin Cities Hip Hop were brought up in. The main movers of Twin Cities Hip Hop came together to form the group Headshots, a precursor to the Rhymesayers Entertainment label. Members of this group included Slug, I Self Devine, Micranots, Musab, Siddiq, and Ant. Slug was one of the main artists to move into the foreground, setting the tone for the style of music to follow in the years to come. Since the emergence of Rhymesayers Entertainment, the Minneapolis hip hop scene has seen the local hip-hop scene erupt with talent including Brother Ali, Eyedea, Orikal Uno, the Doomtree collective and Heiruspecs. The Twin Cities Celebration of hip-hop is an annual event hosted by Yo! The Movement, bringing together people from all walks of life to celebrate the power of community through hip-hop culture. Over the past five years nearly 20,000 people from around the world have taken part in the festival and conference. The Festival has been organised by Founder Toki Wright, Larry Lucio Jr, Claire Redmond, FranzDiego DaHinten, Dimitris Kelly, and Alicia Steele. Another notable annual event is the Soundset music festival, which started its first year on Memorial Day Weekend in May 2008. It features several big name hip hop acts and had over 14,000 in attendance. For 2009, the Soundset music festival was much larger. Some of the notable performing acts include Atmosphere, Pharcyde, Brother Ali, P.O.S, MF Doom, Manny Phesto, Freeway & Jake One, Immortal Technique, Eyedea & Abilities The Cunninlynguists, Sage Francis, El-P, Heiruspecs, Buck 65, Haiku D'Etat, Blue Scholars, I Self Devine, One Be Lo, Unknown Prophets.

For a long period of time, the scene was defined by North High School graduate Houston Alexander, aka Scrib or FAS/ONE. In the 1980s he led a hip hop movement in North Omaha called the Scribble Crew as an alliance of graffiti writers who developed a reputation as the top tag artists in the area. The art stands today at 24th and Binney Streets, to 16th and Corby Streets, and other North Omaha locations, and is still respected by the community.

The St. Louis (\\"Blues\\") Bounce sound was also popularized by hip-hop artists such as Nelly, Pretty Willie (P-Dub), Chingy, J-Kwon, Murphy Lee, etc. and their local producers in the first decade of the 2000s. Metro Boomin started his production career making five beats a day in St. Louis. During high school, his mother would often drive him for over eight hours from St. Louis to Atlanta to collaborate with artists such as OJ da Juiceman, Gucci Mane, and his frequent collaborator Future. Smino gained recognition and critical acclaim with his 2017 debut album, Blkswn, which was released on March 14 signifying the city's area code.

WBLS-FM initially chose not to play the song, however, WESL-AM in East St. Louis made the leap. \\"What happened that fall in St. Louis typified the march of \\"Rapper's Delight\\" into pop music history. After sending the record to Jim Gates, the programmer of WESL in St. Louis, Sylvia followed up with a series of phone calls. After she persuaded him to give the record a try, listener response took care of the rest. Recalling that magical moment, Robinson says, \\"That night, a local distributor phoned in with an order for thirty thousand records. It was so bizarre that the next day I called retailers in the market, who confirmed that the record was that much in demand.\\" Station manager at WESL reported, \\"Everybody wanted to know immediately after it was aired where the record could be bought.\\" Like many other stations around the country, WESL could not play the song enough to satisfy demand and soon had to play the fifteen-minute record twice every hour just to keep the phone lines from jamming\\". Source: Hip Hop Matters: Politics, Pop Culture, and the Struggle for the Soul of a Movement \\"When Gates put needle to wax on \\"Rapper's Delight\\" and the legendary opening verse — \\"Hip- hop, a hibbit to the hibbit to the hip hip-hop\\" — blared across the St. Louis airwaves for the first time, it had a profound impact. Not only did the album eventually sell 14 million copies worldwide, it spawned an entire generation of young St. Louis musicians. A large man with a close-cropped salt-and-pepper Afro and a pencil-thin gray mustache, Gates remembers being stunned by the immediate and frenzied listener response the song inspired. \\"The phone lines were jammed for hours,\\" he says. \\"People were calling and saying, 'Where can I get it? Play it over again so I can tape it!' I made one DJ play it twice an hour for three hours — the whole fifteen minutes.\\" Riverfront Times was unable to locate Sylvia Robinson to comment for this story, and her husband, Joe, died in 2000. But Gates is acknowledged in The Sugar Hill Records Story, a 66-page booklet published in 1999 along with a CD box set to commemorate the twentieth anniversary of \\"Rapper's Delight,\\" and the Robinsons have credited him in several published accounts as the man who \\"broke\\" the song. \\"After I convinced him to play the record just once, [listeners] ended up jamming the phone lines,\\" Joe Robinson told Billboard in 1996. \\"That night, a local distributor phoned in with an order for 30,000 records. It was so bizarre that the next day I called retailers in the market who confirmed that the record was that much in demand.\\" Source: St. Louis Riverfront Times Also read: Vanity Fair's Hip Hop Happens === Pioneers === * Sylk Smoov, who released his self- titled debut album in 1991 that sold 100,000 or more copies.

One of the most important fantasy and science fiction authors in Romanian literature, whose main works are known on several continents, he was also a noted poet, essayist, translator, journalist and comic book author. After he and his spouse at the time Nina Cassian rallied with the left-wing literary circle Orizont during the late 1940s, Colin started his career as a communist and socialist realist writer. During the early years of the Romanian Communist regime, he was assigned offices in the censorship and propaganda apparatus. His 1951 novel Soarele răsare în Deltă (\\"The Sun Rises in the Delta\\") was an early representative of local socialist realist school, but earned Colin much criticism from the cultural establishment of the day, for what it perceived as ideological mistakes. Progressively after the mid-1950s, Colin concentrated on his literary career and abandoned communist ideology. He authored celebrated works such as the mythopoeia Legendele ţării lui Vam (\\"Legends from Vamland\\") and fairy tale collections, making his debut in local science fiction literature with Colecţia de Povestiri Ştiinţifico-Fantastice journal. His work in science fiction, culminating in the 1978 novel Babel, earned Colin three Eurocon prizes. He was given posthumous recognition for his contribution to the genre, and an award named in his honor is regularly granted to established Romanian science fiction authors. From 1970 until his death, he was one of the editors for the Writers' Union literary magazine, Viaţa Românească. ==Biography== ===Early life=== Born in Bucharest into a family of emancipated Romanian Jews.Those Jews from Bârlad who overcome oblivion, at the Romanian Jewish Community site; retrieved February 20, 2008\\"Cassian, Nina: Introduction\\", in Carol T.

On his paternal side, he was also the nephew of Liviu Cohn-Colin, who was a known lawyer employed by the Ministry of Commerce. During World War II and Ion Antonescu's dictatorial regime, as part of Romania's adoption of antisemitic policies, Colin was denied access into educational facilities. At the time, together with poet Nina Cassian, he attended informal lectures on the history of literature and the work of William Shakespeare, given by writer Mihail Sebastian.

Colin studied at the University of Bucharest's Faculty of Letters, but left institution after only one year, spending much of his time working for the UTC, which employed him as publisher of its books. Having served as an activist for the UTC's Central Committee in 1945–1946, Colin was later a broadcast editor for the Radio Company's Bucharest branch, worked as an editor for various left-wing magazines, including Orizont, Flacăra, and Revista Literară. In 1945, he published Poemul lui Octombrie, a translation of Russian-language poems by Soviet writer Vladimir Mayakovsky.Vladimir Maiakovski, Poemul lui Octombrie, Editura Cartea Rusă, 1945 As contributors to Orizont, Colin, Cassian and Solomon supported the view that writers were supposed to immerse themselves into social struggles, an attitude which represented one of the main literary tendencies in the post-war young literature of Romania. They were somewhat close to the group of writers gathered around Geo Dumitrescu, while contrasting with the bohemian group formed around Constant Tonegaru and the Kalende magazine, with the Sibiu Literary Circle, with the Surrealists (Gherasim Luca, Dolfi Trost and their colleagues), and with independent and distinct authors such as Paul Celan and Ion Caraion. After the establishment of a Romanian Communist regime, Vladimir Colin became noted for his vocal support of the new authorities. In 2006, the Presidential Commission for the Study of the Communist Dictatorship in Romania nominated him (together with Ştefănescu, Sorin Toma, and others) among the prominent Communist activists responsible for censorship.

Soon after, Colin came to affiliate with the Romanian socialist realist current, at which time he published the short story Flăcări între cer şi apă (\\"Flames between the Sky and the Sea\\", 1950), followed in 1951 by the novella Cormoranul pleacă pe mare (\\"The Cormorant Heads for the Sea\\") and, later that year, by Soarele răsare în Deltă. All three writings were set in the Danube Delta. Although they were largely compliant with the regime's cultural guidelines, these books were judged to be unsatisfactory by many who reviewed them in the communist press, becoming the subject of a lengthy literary debate.Selejan, p.57-68, 206-207 The Writers' Union convened a special session to review Colin's case. On that occasion, several of his writer colleagues expressed criticism on behalf of the Union, among them Ben Corlaciu, Petru Dumitriu, Alexandru Jar and Mihail Novicov, most of whom expressed the view that Colin was indebted to \\"formalism\\".Selejan, p.66-67 ===1953–1980=== After he made his fantasy and children's literature debut with Basme (\\"Fairy Tales\\"), which earned him the State Prize for Prose for 1953, Colin adopted the fantasy genre as his preferred means of expression, following up with Nemaipomenita bătălie dintre Papură-Împărat şi Pintilie (\\"The Incredible Battle between Emperor Cattail and Pintilie\\", 1953), Toroiman (1954), Poveştile celor trei mincinoşi (\\"The Stories of the Three Liars\\", 1956), Zece poveşti pitice (\\"Ten Dwarfish Stories\\", 1957) and Basmele Omului (\\"The Fairy Tales of Man\\", 1958). These were accompanied in 1961 by mythopoeia, with Legendele ţării lui Vam, also known as A Mythology of Man, which became one of his most popular works. In 1968, Geo Dumitrescu included his translation from French poet Charles Baudelaire into the luxury bilingual edition of Les Fleurs de mal, released under contract with Editura pentru literatură universală. Adrian Grănescu, \\"Traduceri şi traducători – note de lectură – însemnări de cititor\\", in Vatra, Nr. 8-9/2010, p.110 Vladimir Colin made his science fiction debut contributing short stories for Colecţia de Povestiri Ştiinţifico-Fantastice, which functioned as a literary supplement for the magazine Ştiinţă şi Tehnică and was edited by Adrian Rogoz.Mike Ashley, Transformations: the History of the Science-fiction Magazine, Vol. 2: from 1950 to 1970, Liverpool University Press, Liverpool, 2005, p.316.

It was followed by the short story volume of 1966, Viitorul al doilea (\\"The Second Future\\"), the 1972 sword and sorcery novel Divertisment pentru vrăjitoare (\\"Entertainment for Witches\\") and short story collection Capcanele timpului (\\"Time Traps\\"), and the 1975 novella Ultimul avatar al lui Tristan (\\"Tristan's Final Avatar\\") and short story volume Dinţii lui Cronos (\\"The Teeth of Chronos\\"). One of the most successful books in this category was the 1978 novel Babel, which also established his reputation outside Romania. Colin also continued to publish non-science fiction works, such as the 1967 mythopoeic novel Pentagrama (\\"The Pentagram\\") and the 1984 narrative poem for children, Xele, motanul din stele (\\"Xelar, Tomcat Stellar\\"). Others include Povestea scrisului (\\"The Story of Writing\\", 1966), Imposibila oază, povestiri fantastice (\\"The Impossible Oasis, Fantasy Stories\\", 1982) and Timp cu călăreţ şi corb (\\"Time with Rider and Raven\\", 1985). In 1970, Vladimir Colin became a member of the editorial staff for Viaţa Românească, an office which he held until his death. During that decade, he and Rogoz attended Cenaclul Marţienilor (\\"The Martians' Literary Club\\"), founded by Sergiu Fărcăşan and grouping together other prominent Romanian science fiction authors and promoters—George Anania, Horia Aramă, Ion Hobana and Sanda Radian among them. \\"Cenaclul marţienilor - din nou pe orbită\\", in Adevărul, January 7, 2003 He was also acknowledged as one of the few Romanian comic book writers, and for thus contributing to an art and literary genre which was just building a tradition in Romania under communism. Vali Ivan, \\"Lumea copiilor de altădată\\" (interview with Dodo Niţă, head of the Romanian Comic Book Association) , in Jurnalul Naţional, June 2, 2007 ===Final years=== His work in science fantasy earned Colin three Eurocon awards during his lifetime (a recognition no other Romanian writer has since equaled). In addition to one of the 19 Awards at Eurocon 1976, he won the Best Novel Award, for Babel, and the Lifelong Literary Achievement Award (1989).The ESFS Awards, listed at the European Science Fiction Society site; retrieved February 19, 2008 Babel was also the recipient of a 1978 award granted by the Bucharest section of the Writers' Union (he had previously won the same distinction for Capcanele timpului). In 1980, he received the EUROPA Prize, granted in Stresa, Italy. Also that year, University of Padua presented him with the Provincia di Treno European Award for his contributions to fantasy and children's literature. In addition to his own literary contributions, Colin completed other translations from French literature. In 1980, he published with Editura Ion Creangă a version of Jules Verne's Carpathian Castle, which is set in Transylvania and depicts several ethnic Romanian characters. Muguraş Constantinescu, \\"Remarques sur la traduction en roumain du Château de Carpathes de Jules Verne\\" , in Atelier de Traduction, Nr. 3/2005, p.100-110, at the Ştefan cel Mare University of Suceava Radu-Ilarion Munteanu, \\"Cu Lucian Boia şi Ion Hobană în lumea lui Jules Verne\\", at the LiterNet publishing house; retrieved February 17, 2008 Richard Wagner, \\"Arcul Carpatic. Topos, logo, ideolegmă\\", in Revista 22, Nr. 867, October 2006 His text is noted for having largely preserved Verne's original spellings of Romanian-language words, whereas later translations attempted to identify their supposed source variants. Among the other writers translated by Colin are Pierre-Jean de Béranger, André Gide and Gérard Klein. He also compiled a French science fiction literature anthology—Un pic de neant. O antologie a anticipaţiei franceze contemporane (\\"A Piece of the Void - an Anthology of Contemporary French Science Fiction Literature\\", 1970)—, and a Romanian anthology published in France by Éditions Marabout—Les meilleures histoires de la Science Fiction roumaine (\\"The Best Stories in Romanian Science Fiction\\", 1975). In 1984, Colin suffered a stroke, which permanently impaired his writing abilities. ==Work== ===Debut works and connected debates=== For much of his early career, Colin was known for his proletkult poems and agitprop articles in the official press. Fernanda Emanuela Osman, \\"Note despre poezia agitatorică a anilor '50\\" , in Caietele Echinox , Vol.7: Literatură şi Totalitarism, 2004, at the Babeş-Bolyai University Center for Imagination Studies One of these literary pieces constituted praise for communization under Romania's first five-year plan: titled Cîntec pentru primul plan economic (\\"Song for the First Economic Plan\\"), it was one in a series of propaganda pieces on the same subject (it also included works by Maria Banuş, Dan Deşliu and Dragoş Vicol). Vladimir Colin's socialist realist prose debut was with Flăcări între cer şi apă, a story about Communist Youth militants in the Danube Delta area, engaged in a struggle with demonized anti-communist forces. It was first reviewed in the press by Viaţa Românească journalist and critic Marin Vasilescu, who noted its depiction of \\"amplified class struggle in the period of passage between capitalism and socialism\\", praising Colin for \\"managing to show the intrigues of the class enemy as a conscious and organized action\\".Selejan, p.57 However, Vasilescu also introduced criticism of Colin's style, claiming that it failed in \\"deepening [its] central idea, the issue of vigilance\\", and that the investigations made by communist protagonists seemed \\"casual\\". Similarly, Cormoranul pleacă pe mare, which showed fishermen and sailors setting up a collective farm, was commended by Contemporanul journal for breaking with the tradition of Delta-themed \\"bourgeois literature\\", but disapproved for failing to show \\"that which is genuinely new about the communist sailor.\\"Selejan, p.58-59 Soarele răsare în Deltă, also centered on the Danube Delta, and having the model-fisherman Artiom for a protagonist, prolonged the debate about the merits of Colin's literary contributions. Contimporanul 's Sami Damian opined that the writer \\"fails to portray in significant traits the complexity of new, advanced, phenomenons which emerge in the Delta region\\", and that he lacked \\"profound knowledge of the new reality, [which] he has distorted, falsified.\\"Selejan, p.60 This critique of Colin formed part of a larger piece about the low \\"ideological level\\" of various novels, to which Damian opposed examples of works by Petru Dumitriu and Ion Călugăru.Selejan, p.59 Writing for Viaţa Românească, critic Eugen Campus stood against Damian's pronouncements, notably praising Soarele răsare în Deltă for its treatment of the \\"exploiter\\" as a person of \\"gluttonous idleness\\", \\"cruelty\\" and \\"lack of humanity\\".Selejan, p.61 He also noted that, \\"in general, [Colin] avoided clichés\\", but expressed criticism for the novel having little narrative focus (comparing it to a \\"meandering river\\") and for a \\"conceptual deficiency\\" which, he argued, tended to favor \\"that which is old.\\"Selejan, p.61-62 This verdict was backed by the local literary review Iaşul Nou, which, although viewing the novel as an authentic work (\\"Vladimir Colin, we presume, is an actual son of the Delta\\"),Selejan, p.64 added similar topics of criticism.Selejan, p.64-67 By the time when the special Writers' Union meeting was convened to discuss Soarele răsare în Deltă, Colin's case was being analyzed by the Communist Party organ, Scînteia. Official critic Sergiu Fărcăşan, himself later known as a since fiction author, contributed the Scînteia column of May 1952 in which he reacted against the supposed leniency on the part of other commentators.Selejan, p.33-35, 67-69 The article notably likened the appraisals found in Campus' review of the novel with \\"book advertisements that used to be made by bourgeois publishing houses\\".Selejan, p.68 It concluded that, as a writer, Vladimir Colin had \\"broken away from the masses.\\" Literary historian Ana Selejan defines this verdict as \\"the official recommendation within the discussion\\".Selejan, p.67 The Writers' Union debate itself, involving primarily the Communist Party unit, was summarized in a report issued by the Party's Agitprop Directorate as follows: \\"Colin was criticized by Party members for the serious mistakes of his novel Soarele răsare în Deltă.\\"Cristian Vasile, Literatura şi artele în România comunistă. 1948-1953, Humanitas, Bucharest, 2010, p.83. In a 1953 article, Campus revisited Colin's novel, listing it among the \\"works which falsify reality, which are mistaken from an ideological point of view\\" (also included in this category were books by Eusebiu Camilar and Ben Corlaciu).Selejan, p.206-207 ===Debut in fantasy=== Colin's move to the modern fantasy genre, which he helped pioneer in Romania, came at a time when science fiction literature was used by the regime to further popularize its ideological messages. Mihai Iovănel, \\"Pe fundaţia SF-ului românesc este ştanţat logo-ul URSS\\", in Gândul, February 16, 2008 Robert Lazu, \\"Metamorfozele basmului\\", in Adevărul Literar şi Artistic, April 19, 2005 At the time, Vladimir Colin made controversial statements such as claiming that the fantasy genre was supposed to be employed as \\"a weapon in the hands of the people\\". However, Selejan believes, the beginning of this new period in Colin's career was equivalent to a \\"refuge\\". Colin himself said at that point that he was especially interested in what he saw as \\"the specific enterprise of literature\\": \\"exploiting the unconscious mind's conscience, in order to design essential fables, which would define the human condition.\\" Basmele Omului, one of Colin's first books in this series, groups modern-day fairy tales, and has been described writer and journalist Mihai Iovănel as a \\"wonderful\\" work. Mihai Iovănel, \\"Viaţa glorioasă şi mizerabilă a Fantasy-ului românesc\\", in Gândul, December 19, 2007 Published soon after, Legendele ţării lui Vam is written as a collection of myths relating to a vanished civilization, which is supposed to have lived in the Black Sea area in the neolithic period. Introduced as the translation of archeological finds in Northern Dobruja, the narrative centers on Vamland's founding myth, a fight between the god-of-gods Ormag and the human male Vam, one which starts as a \\"cat-and-mouse game\\" and ends in defeat for the family of gods and victory for the small tribe of humans.Horia Aramă, \\"Vladimir Colin. Legends from Vamland (book review)\\", in Utopian Studies, Vol.13, Nr. 2/2002 Trapped and chained by Ormag early in the narrative, Vam and his mistress Una inspire their descendants to meet the gods' cruelty with a passive form of resistance, and obtain their own immortality in the hearts of people. Commenting on this plot line, Horia Aramă believes that as \\"the symbol of the vital force of humanity\\", Colin's \\"hero without cape and sword\\" Vam, adds a new layer of significance to the ancient mythologies which are believed to have inspired it. Author Bogdan Suceavă describes the central elements of the books as being \\"the battle against fear\\" and \\"a cosmogony of fantasy\\", and praises the text for its \\"solidity and coherence.\\" Bogdan Suceavă, \\"Scriind Miruna\\", in Familia, Nr. 2/2008, p.70 ===Debut in science fiction=== Colin's science fiction prose has been noted for its lyrical approach to the subject and the classical line of its narrative, displaying influences from Karel Čapek, H. P. Lovecraft and A. Merritt. Commentators have described his adoption of the genre as his distancing from older and newer communist imperatives of the period. Thus, according to Iovănel, Colin's writings of the period were equivalent with \\"an error in the system\\", for being \\"more aerial [than other works], and therefore less useful [to the regime]\\". According to critic Mircea Opriţă, Colin, like Aramă, \\"did not penetrate into the science fiction realm just so they could exercise lightheartedly among the genre's cliché ideas and patented motifs.\\" Mircea Opriţă, \\"Horia Aramă (1931-2007)\\" , in România Literară, Nr. 45/2007 Likewise, Iovănel believes that, after the 1960s, Romanian science fiction literature, freed from the more stringent of ideological commands, was foremost represented by \\"survivors\\" whose early careers were marked by \\"sufficient compromises\\" with the regime, but whose later contributions to the genre were often outstanding. This criterion, he argued, applied to Colin, Rogoz, Fărcăşan, Camil Baciu and, to a certain degree, Ovid Crohmălniceanu (who, late in his career, also wrote various science fiction stories). In discussing the \\"technicist mythology\\" of the science fiction produced in countries of the Eastern Bloc, Stéphanie Nicot, a French writer and editor of Galaxies magazine, notes that, although being \\"economically backward\\" in comparison with Western countries, Communist Romania, alongside the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of Poland, produced a \\"lively\\" science fiction literature. Stéphanie Nicot, \\"Une fenêtre sur l'avenir\\", in TDC, SCÉRÉN - Centre national de documentation pédagogique, Nr. 715, May 1, 1996 Also according to Nicot, Colin, like the Soviet brothers Arkady and Boris Strugatsky and the Polish Stanisław Lem, was able to evade \\"takeover by the single party\\", which had come to \\"largely suppress authors who were nevertheless not devoid of talent.\\" With A zecea lume, a science fantasy, Vladimir Colin moved closer to the conventions of the science fiction subgenres, even though the plot was secondary to its descriptive parts. The book depicts life on a planet named Thule, located on the edge of the Solar System, where humans live side by side with Martians, Venusians, and other creatures (including local inhabitants, whose column-like bodies are made from blue silicon). With Viitorul al doilea, Colin introduces references to paranormal phenomenons and time travel. The series includes Giovanna şi îngerul (\\"Giovanna and the Angel\\"), whom some see as the masterpiece of his short prose, contains allusions to one of the main themes in Romanian folklore, that of \\"youth without old age\\" (see Legende sau basmele românilor). In it, the world-famous poet Giovanna is led to the discovery that space radiation has turned her astronaut husband into a mutant, who can never grow old or die. In Broasca, one of his few purely science fiction stories, Colin probably takes inspiration from Lovecraft's The Color Out of Space, showing alien beings attempting to contact humans, an experiment which fails when their amphibian emissary is unwittingly killed by a girl, who in turn becomes the source of a radiating purple light. Other Viitorul al doilea pieces have exotic locations on Earth for their setting. One such story is Lnaga, in which consuming an eponymous African mushroom leads the protagonist to synesthesia and an out-of-body experience, whereby he becomes his slave trading ancestor. Cetatea morţilor (\\"The Citadel of the Dead\\") shows a 17th-century mestizo man who, cheating Inca survivors into believing that he is the god Viracocha, gains access to the secret legacy of Atlantis. ===Babel and other late works=== In some of his other writings, the Romanian author adopted historical fantasy, sword and sorcery, and heroic fantasy, which he occasionally integrated within the framework of local history. The fantasy volume Pentagrama, favorably reviewed by Crohmălniceanu, evokes not only the pentagram's symbolic implication as a figure where five points on a circle always meet in nonconsecutive order, but also its presence as a cult object in many ancient traditions. The text thus aims to build connections with various mythologies, to which it constantly alludes, and is thought by Belgian critic Jean-Baptiste Baronian to take additional inspiration from the stories of Franz Kafka.Jean-Baptiste Baronian, Un nouveau fantastique. Esquisse sur les métamorphoses d'un genre littéraire, L'Âge d'Homme, Lausanne, 1977, p.38. Inspired in part by the style of Gérard Klein and his Overlords of War, the short novel Divertisment pentru vrăjitoare centers on the notion that the activity of a human brain can surpass that of any machine. It shows a Transylvanian witch with psychokinetic powers and the gift of precognition, whose ability to modify the future is harnessed by a group of time travelers. Ultimul avatar al lui Tristan depicts its hero, the eponymous alchemist, who is in the service of French King Henry II. Disguising his work as investigations into chrysopoeia, Tristan discovers the philosopher's stone and escapes into a fourth dimension world, from which he visits past and future, in an attempt to modify both his biography and the course of human history. With Babel, his critically acclaimed novel, Colin was returning to science fantasy. The subject shares elements with Stanisław Lem's 1961 work Solaris, showing living creatures from the Solar System being trapped on a distant planet by the tyrant scientist Scat Mor. The group of prisoners includes the Venusian female Or-alda, the Martian contract killer Idomar av Olg su Saro and the human poet Ralt Moga, all of whom are exposed to psychological torture by their captor, who increases his energy by absorbing their suffering. Although Scat Mor succeeds in making his victims live out their nightmares, his experiment is tenaciously sabotaged by Or-alda, who uses magic as her weapon. Mihai Iovănel is skeptical as to the originality of Babel 's plot, arguing that the book may have partly plagiarized The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch, a 1965 novel by the American Philip K. Dick. ==Legacy== Colin's work is one of the best-known samples of the local science fiction genre known outside Romania. British science fiction bibliographer Mike Ashley indicated that, of all the writers who debuted as contributors to Colecţia de Povestiri Ştiinţifico-Fantastice, Vladimir Colin is \\"the best known outside Romania\\", while Horia Aramă wrote: \\"[Colin's] imaginary worlds entered in the most impressive European collections and are known in three continents.\\" Early on, Colin's communist story Cormoranul pleacă pe mare went through a Hungarian- language edition.Selejan, p.58 In the decades after it was published at home, Babel was translated into French, English, German, Russian and Bulgarian. Translations of Legendele ţării lui Vam were also published into German, French, Russian, Bulgarian, as well as Czech, Polish and Japanese. It was published in English as Legends from Vamland, a version translated, abridged and partly retold by Luiza Carol (2001). Basmele Omului came close in this respect, being itself known to an international public. In 1992, writer Leonard Oprea founded the Bucharest-based Vladimir Colin Romanian Cultural Foundation as well as the Vladimir Colin International Award.\\"Portrait: Oprea, Leonard\\", at the Central and Eastern European Online Library; retrieved February 20, 2008 Among the Romanian and international recipients of the Vladimir Colin International Award are Vladimir Tismăneanu, Andrei Codrescu, Nicolae Manolescu, and Şerban Foarţă. In 2000, Ion Hobana and Gérard Klein instituted the Vladimir Colin Awards for excellence in science fiction literature. \\"Premiile 'Vladimir Colin' \\" , in Cronica Română, December 9, 2006 Michael Hăulică, \\"Fantasy & science fiction. Despre premii, numai de bine\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 389, September 2007 Due to various constraints, the awards were not granted for a period of five years after their creation, and they cannot be granted to past recipients. According to poet and science fiction author Michael Hăulică, who was himself a recipient, such issues have led to the awards' decrease in importance. As a posthumous tribute, Nemira publishing house has republished Colin's fiction books in a Vladimir Colin author series. As of 2000, Nemira has exclusive rights on publishing Colin's work in Romania. Oana Capalb, \\"Editurile româneşti şi Internetul\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 26, August 2000 Several authors took inspiration from Colin's work. In his 1976 novel Verde Aixa, Aramă expanded on Colin's Broasca themes. Among younger authors, Bogdan Suceavă acknowledges that Colin's writings, which he had read as a child in the 1980s, contributed to generating his own interest in fantasy literature, and in turn led him to write the 2007 book Miruna, o poveste (\\"Miruna, a Story\\"). Leonard Oprea dedicated his 2001 Cartea lui Theophil Magus sau 40 de Poveşti despre om (\\"The Book of Theophil Magus or 40 Stories about Man\\") to Vladimir Colin and the Orthodox hermit Nicolae Steinhardt, naming them as, respectively, \\"father\\" and \\"teacher\\".Leonard Oprea, Cartea lui Theophil Magus sau 40 de Poveşti despre om, Editura LiterNet, Bucharest, 2006, p.8. Mihai Iovănel nevertheless argues that, \\"outside of fandom\\", Colin's work remains \\"mostly forgotten\\" in Romania. Artists who have provided the original illustrations for Colin's books include Jules Perahim (for the 1945 translation from Mayakovsky) and Marcela Cordescu (for both Basme and Legendele ţării lui Vam).Basme, Editura Tineretului, 1955. ; Legendele ţării lui Vam, Editura Ion Creangă, 1986. Legendele ţării lui Vam has also been reissued as a comic book by the French magazine Métal Hurlant, being illustrated by the Croatian artist Igor Kordey and circulated in France and Spain. Pruncul năzdrăvan (\\"The Rogue Babe\\"), part of Colin's Basme, was the basis for a puppet theater adaptation, first showcased in 2004 by the Gong Theater in Sibiu. C.

The nearest major towns are Airdrie () and Coatbridge (). The village is west of Caldercruix and the North Calder Water. The population is about 2,740. ==Etymology== The origin of the name \\"Plains\\" is unknown. One suggestion is that the name derives (via the plural of Plain) from the view afforded to the Cistercian Monks of Newbattle Abbey as they travelled to what is now the site of the village. These monks farmed the wider area for grain in what became known as Monklands. But the geography of the area runs contrary to this idea. Alternatively, the name may be a contraction of \\"The Plains of Waterloo\\" - a name given by a returning soldier from the Napoleonic wars. Either way, it is not uncommon for locals to refer to the village as \\"The Plains\\". ==Geography== Plains is situated on the gentle south facing slope of the valley of the North Calder Water, which is a tributary of the River Clyde. To the north of the settlement runs a series of unclassified roads known to older residents as The Backies. Opencast mining in the 1970s and 1980s took away much of the natural beauty within this network of roads which since has further been eroded with the advent of a landfill site. The Main Street (the A89) runs in a straight line for about east to west. Almost all of the residential housing of the village lies on the northern side of Main St., forming a roughly square shape (1 mile each side). To the south of Main St., the valley drops more steeply down to the North Calder, then steeply up the other side, which is home to the parkland Easter Moffat golf course. Plains lies at around above sea level. From the nearby Airdriehill Farm, there is a wide vista to the west across the urbanised lower Clyde valley. Beyond, on a clear day, it is possible to see Ben Lomond and the Isle of Arran. To the south-east of Plains, the land rises to almost – the highest land in the narrow isthmus across central Scotland spanning the Scottish watershed. Consequently, the area was chosen as the location for Scotland's first television transmitting stations. The Black Hill Transmitter, at tall, is a very prominent local landmark. It began broadcasting independent Scottish Television services in August 1957. Nearby, but not so tall or prominent, is Kirk o'Shotts transmitter mast, which broadcast Scotland's first BBC television signals in March 1952. There is now a second transmitter (completed 2009) which will replace the older one, which itself will be relocated within the Scottish transmitting network. ==History== The village was founded in the mid-19th century along what is now the A89 Airdrie to Bathgate road. The population of the village in 1860 is recorded at just over 200. Much of the original growth of the village was in keeping with the expansion of the coal mining industry in North Lanarkshire, most notably the Ardenrigg Coal Co Ltd. This coal mining activity dwindled in the second half of the 20th century. However, Scotland's largest opencast coal mine is currently in operation at Drumshangie Moss, a few miles north-west of Plains. There has been controversy regarding the impact of this mine on the site of the Stanrigg Mining Disaster where, in July 1918, a collapse led to the deaths of 19 local mine workers. Timber supplier's yard Late 20th century expansion of the village has been to the north of the A89 road in separate developments of local government or Council houses, consisting of blocks of terraced houses. Originally planned as affordable, rented accommodations for the predominantly working class population, a large percentage have become owner occupied in recent years. At the beginning of the 21st century, a new development of relatively large, detached houses was established in the north-east corner of the village. There is no significant single employer within the village. During the last decades of the 20th century, the main employers were the Geest Company and Beechams. Geest occupied a site in the middle of the village, south towards the railway, and was involved in the receipt and packaging of fruit for distribution throughout the country. The site is now a timber yard managed by a company called Rowan Timber. The Beecham site was a warehouse and distribution facility employing a number of local drivers and located adjacent to Geest Bananas. The warehouse was recently demolished and the site is to be developed for additional housing. ==Plains today== Today, Plains is a largely working class settlement with local people commuting for employment throughout urban central Scotland. There have been recent housing developments that have expanded the village. These tend to be more up-market dwellings, and are more modern than the council houses which predominate in the village. There has been a new swing park added to Plains and a post office was opened in 2016. A campaign to bring a railway station has not yet been successful. Plains has an active Community Council. ===Organised religion=== Christian worship takes place at the Elim Gospel Hall and at Plains Evangelical Church. What is now Plains Evangelical Church, a thriving non-denominational independent church, was begun by Mr Robert McCracken in 1900. St David's Catholic church remains open for worship. === Education === There are two state schools: St David's Primary and Plains Primary. Both schools are accommodated in a shared campus built on the former football pitches on the west side of Bruce Street. These football pitches were the former site of pit bings which were only removed as the result of community pressure in the 1960s. ==Points of interest== National Cycle Route 75, a Sustrans long distance cycle path, ran parallel and around south of Main Street. This was constructed along the bed of a former North British Railway line which previously had linked Glasgow and Edinburgh. On 10 May 2007, the bill to allowing this line to be re-established as a commuter railway was passed by the Scottish Parliament. The line opened in December 2010. In addition to the re-opening of this 'missing link' between Glasgow and Edinburgh the existing line between Bathgate and Edinburgh was electrified. As a result of the re-establishment of the railway line, the Sustrans cycle path now stops before reaching Plains on the west side and restarts at the east end of Plains Main Street. In the mid to late 20th century, Plains Countryside Park was the site of the annual Plains Summer Gala - a day of parades, children's sports events and entertainment - a tradition typical of villages in the area including Harthill, Whitburn and Armadale. Although around nineteen years since the Plains Summer Gala was last held, a new committee formed and resurrected this tradition in 2012. The Gala included a lively procession around the village and games and stalls on the play parks in the middle of the village. ==Further reading== # Wilson, Rhona: \\"Old Airdrie Villages\\" == References == ==External links== * Airdrie Museum Category:Villages in North Lanarkshire Category:Airdrie, North Lanarkshire ","title":"Plains, North Lanarkshire"},{"id":"3235828","text":"Many police-related slang terms exist for police officers.

(also known as SpongeBob SquarePants and Friends: Unite! in PAL regions) is a 2005 video game featuring characters and levels from SpongeBob SquarePants, Danny Phantom, The Fairly OddParents, and The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius. In the game, the player can control four Nicktoons characters (SpongeBob SquarePants, Jimmy Neutron, Timmy Turner, and Danny Phantom) as they work together to stop an evil plan concocted by villains from each character's series. An Xbox version was planned, but was cancelled in development. The game was released to generally mixed reviews and spawned three sequels: Nicktoons: Battle for Volcano Island, Nicktoons: Attack of the Toybots, and SpongeBob SquarePants featuring Nicktoons: Globs of Doom. ==Gameplay== In the console version, the player can play with three computers and no other human players, or with a friend or two with the remaining computer(s). One can switch abilities, which have multiple uses. There are also things only a certain character can do. For example, SpongeBob is needed to use Bubble Bombs to blow up a pillar, Danny is needed to use Ghostly Wail on some glass, Timmy is needed to use Freeze Glove to freeze some water, or Jimmy has to shoot down some things with his Neutron Flare. Goddard can be found in all four worlds (and oddly enough, inside himself) so he can upgrade the player's weapons and abilities. The DS version is a full 3D platformer where the player controls one of the four characters at a time, which can be selected at any moment via the touchscreen, while the GBA version is a 2D platformer where he/she has to alternate between the two characters given at the beginning of the level in order to progress. It uses pre-rendered 3D sprites based on the models of the DS version. ==Plot== The gamer is first introduced to SpongeBob SquarePants, who realizes that Plankton has taken over Bikini Bottom. Then Goddard exits a portal, and displays a message to SpongeBob from Jimmy Neutron. Following Goddard through the portal, he meets Jimmy, Danny Phantom, and Timmy Turner. Jimmy coats SpongeBob with self- regenerating moisture to keep him healthy. Jimmy then explains that his latest invention, the Universe Portal Machine (a device to open portals to other dimensions) had been copied by Prof. Calamitous, who went on to use it to form a Syndicate with Plankton, Vlad Plasmius, and Denzel Crocker; they have already begun stealing energy from each of their worlds for their masterplan. Since Calamitous' lair cannot be found, they start with the other worlds first by stopping the Syndicate from siphoning any more energy. The heroes arrive in Vlad's new castle by accident, where he reveals his ghost portal is siphoning energy from the Ghost Zone to further the Syndicate's plans, and as a precaution, Vlad has captured Danny's parents. Vlad then knocks them out and imprisons them in the Ghost Zone Prison. Befriending the Box Ghost, the heroes escape after knocking out Walker. Danny leads the heroes to the Fenton Works ghost portal, where he claims no relation to the Fentons and that they are Ghost Hunter experts. They meet Danny's friends, Sam and Tucker, who explain that some ghosts have possessed the citizens. Danny drives out the ghosts before the group cuts through the Amity Park Graveyard to Vlad's castle. Upon arrival, Jimmy realizes there are generators keeping the portal open. The gang destroys the generators, thus shutting off the portal. Confronting Vlad, Danny possesses his dad Jack, using the 'Ghost Gauntlets' to pummel Vlad. Vlad gloats the Syndicate is building something and they already have sufficient ghost energy to help power it before fleeing. The heroes' next destination is Bikini Bottom (with Jimmy, Danny, and Timmy using Jimmy's air gum to breathe underwater). They meet Sandy, who explains that Plankton is using harvesters to capture jellyfish to extract power from their sting; he has also imprisoned Mr. Krabs. Sandy sends them to Jellyfish Fields to meet Patrick, but upon meeting him, he is sucked into a harvester. After destroying the harvesters, the group find themselves on the Flying Dutchman's ship; for he wants them (minus SpongeBob since he's annoying) to be his new crew. However, Danny persuades him to let them go in exchange for bringing back his old crew. Upon arriving at the Chum Bucket, they free Patrick and the jellyfish. On the roof, they face Plankton, using a robotic crab, and rescue Mr. Krabs. The heroes then learn that the Syndicate is extracting energy for a Doomsday Device, and Crocker is still supplying power to it. In Dimmsdale, the heroes infiltrate Crocker's golden fortress, finding a rainbow of Fairy Magic ending there. After cutting off the fortress' supply of Fairy Magic, they arrive in Fairy World and Since Jimmy has been here before, he gives an incorrect explanation about it not being real. They encounter Jorgen von Strangle, who explains that Crocker is extracting the magic from the Big Wand to feed the Doomsday Machine. After freeing the fairies, they reach The Big Wand, where they defeat Crocker flying a massive exosuit fueled by Fairy Magic. SpongeBob and Danny deduce that the villains have retreated to Retroville in order to regroup after being defeated. Timmy, on the other hand, believes everything will be okay with the Big Wand giving fairies back their full magic, by wishing the bad guys into jail and the dismantling of the Doomsday machine. However, Wanda announces that Da Rules only allow changes to Dimmsdale's dimension, disappointing the heroes. They return to Jimmy's lab, where they meet Cindy Vortex when suddenly Calamitous contacts them, revealing that the Doomsday Machine is almost finished. SpongeBob sees Goddard scratching himself and says he should take a bath, making Jimmy realize Calamitous planted a flea-bot in Goddard to spy on him. Realizing that the only way to stop Calamitous is to trace the flea-bot's signal, the heroes use Jimmy's shrink ray to shrink down and enter Goddard, and after defeating the flea-bot, Jimmy hacks the flea- bot's circuitry to locate Calamitous' lair. Upon arrival, the Syndicate declares that the current world of Retroville will be destroyed as a show of their power, and the machine will protect them from the destruction. Despite the heroes' damaging the machine, the villains continue the count down. SpongeBob miraculously unplugs the Doomsday Machine, and Calamitous laments that he had forgotten to finish the back-up power supply. With Calamitous in prison, the heroes part ways. Jimmy gives the heroes each a Neutronic Recaller in case of a future incident. SpongeBob leaves first, most likely holding Plankton captive in his pocket. Danny gives Jimmy a second Fenton Thermos that he had made with Jimmy's matter copier (since Vlad is trapped in the original), which Jimmy thinks will help him figure out what \\"those phantasm images really were.\\" Timmy thanks Jimmy for a Hyber-Cube, which is holding Crocker captive. Cindy waves Timmy off. After this, Jimmy shouts a familiar line: \\"Cindy, get out of my lab!\\" ==Reception== All versions of the game received generally mixed reviews, being mostly criticized for the monotony of the gameplay. In an IGN review, Mark Bozen gave the DS version of the game 5/10 stars, stating the crossover concept had been done \\"far better in previous games.\\" In a more positive review for the PlayStation 2 version, Gamezone opined that \\"while somewhat repetitious, the linear design and simple control schemes will draw players along and it is not hard to work through the levels.\\" Review aggregator Metacritic gave the PlayStation 2 version of the game a score of 53 out of 100 based on 8 reviews. ==References== Category:2005 video games Category:2006 video games Category:Cancelled Xbox games Category:Cooperative video games Category:Crossover video games Category:Game Boy Advance games Category:GameCube games Category:Nicktoons video games Category:Nintendo DS games Category:PlayStation 2 games Category:THQ games Category:TOSHI Engine games Category:Action-adventure games Category:SpongeBob SquarePants video games Category:Video games based on The Fairly OddParents Category:Video games developed in Australia Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Video games featuring parallel universes Category:Video games scored by Matthew Simmonds Category:Video games with cel- shaded animation ","title":"Nicktoons Unite!"},{"id":"3235837","text":"Hack Kampmann (6 September 1856 – 27 June 1920) was a Danish architct, Royal Inspector of Listed State Buildings in Jutland and professor at the architecture department of the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts. Marselisborg Palace in Aarhus, built between 1899 and 1902, is among his best known works. Marselisborg Palace in Aarhus == Biography == His parents were Christian Peter Georg Kampmann, a parish priest, and Johanne Marie Schmidt. He entered the architecture department of the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in 1873 and graduated in 1882, receiving the school's prestigious small gold medal (\\"Lille guldmedalje\\") for the design of a \\"Swimming bath in the Italian Renaissance style\\". Kampmann went on numerous study trips throughout Europe, paid for by several scholarships, including northern Italy, Greece and Sweden. He also attended the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris in 1882 and worked with professor Jacques Hermant. Back home in Denmark, he became a prolific architect, designing private villas, private art museums, commercial buildings, churches, as well as both small state buildings, such as post offices, and large ones such as royal palaces. Among his major works are the Provincial Archives of Northern Jutland (1890–91) in Viborg, Jutland ; the Aarhus Theatre (1898–1900); Marselisborg Palace (built 1899–1902 as a wedding gift from the people to Crown Prince Christian (later Christian X); the extension to the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek in Copenhagen; and the Copenhagen Police Headquarters, Copenhagen (1918–1922). Kampmann was initially one of the leading Danish proponents of National Romantic style. However, during the 1920s he adopted the Nordic Classicism style, becoming one of its main initiators. One of his more notable works is one of the culminations of the style, the Police Headquarters in Copenhagen (1918–22) (in a team with Aage Rafn, Holger Jacobsen and F. Fredriksen) was among the initiators of 1920s Nordic Classicism. This last building was completed after his death in summer 1920 by his two sons, Christian and Hans Jørgen Kampmann, together with Rafn. Kampmann also was responsible for a number of building restoration projects, notably Aarhus Cathedral (1907–20). As professor of architecture at the architecture department of the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts from 1908 to 1918 he lectured on domestic architecture as well as the great architecture of the world, especially the visual effects of the Greek temple. In his watercolours he managed to capture the overall impression; the characteristic \\"wet style\\" seen in the watercolours of Aage Rafn, Steen Eiler Rasmussen and Aarne Jacobsen goes back to Kampmann. Kampmann is one of the most influential architects in Danish architectural history.Entry \\"Hack Kampmann\\", in Simo Paavilainen (ed.), Nordic Classicism 1910–1930, Helsinki: Museum of Finnish Architecture, 1982. == Awards == He was made a Knight of the Order of the Dannebrog (1897), awarded Dannebrogsmann (1906) and the King's Medal of Merit in Gold (1900). == Personal life == He was married during 1888 to Johanne Holm (1868–1920). He died during 1920 in Copenhagen and was buried at Vestre Kirkegård. == The buildings and restoration works == Copenhagen Police Headquarters, 1924. Frederiksberg Courthouse, 1921.

(23 January 1876 – 1 November 1945) was a German Jesuit priest and a leading figure of the Catholic resistance to Nazism in Munich. In 1987, he was beatified by Pope John Paul II. ==Early life== Mayer was born and grew up in Stuttgart, one of five siblings. He finished his secondary education in 1894 and studied philosophy and theology in Freiburg, Switzerland; Munich and Tübingen. He was, among other things, a member of A.V. Guestfalia Tübingen and K.D.St.V. Aenania München, two Studentenverbindungen that belong to the Cartellverband der katholischen deutschen Studentenverbindungen. In 1899, he was ordained a priest and served for a year as an assistant pastor in Spaichingen before joining the Society of Jesus in Feldkirch, Vorarlberg, Austria (then Austria-Hungary) in 1900. After his novitiate, he went to the Netherlands for further studies between 1906 and 1911, and the moved about Germany, Switzerland and the Netherlands preaching missions in many parishes.\\"Bl Rupert Mayer. SJ\\", The Jesuits, Singapore In 1912, he was transferred to Munich, where his ministry was largely to migrants who had come to the city seeking employment. ==Army chaplain== Iron Cross medal of Fr. Rupert Mayer, exhibited in the Bürgersaalkirche of Munich From 1914, Mayer volunteered as a chaplain in the First World War. He was initially assigned to a camp hospital; but was later made a Field Captain and sent to the fronts in France, Poland and Romania as chaplain to a division of soldiers. His bravery was legendary and he was held in great esteem by the soldiers. When there was fighting at the front, Fr. Mayer would be found himself crawling along the ground from one soldier to the next talking to them, and administering the Sacraments to them. In December 1915, Fr. Mayer was the first chaplain to win the Iron Cross for bravery in recognition of his work with the soldiers at the front. In December 1916, he lost his left leg after it was injured in a grenade attack. He returned to Munich to convalesce and was referred to as the Limping Priest. Mayer worked managing a clerical retreat, as a preacher, and as of 1921 as a leader of the men's sodality in Munich. Mayer introduced Sunday Masses at the main railroad terminal for the convenience of travelers.Rochford SJ, Thomas. \\"Blessed Rupert Mayer\\", Jesuit Curia in Rome ==Protest against the Nazis== In January 1933, when Adolf Hitler became Chancellor of Germany, he began to close church-affiliated schools and started a campaign to discredit the religious orders in Germany. Mayer spoke out against this persecution from the pulpit of St. Michael's in downtown Munich and because he was a powerful influence in the city, the Nazis could not tolerate such a force to oppose them. On 16 May 1937, the Gestapo ordered Mayer to stop speaking in public which he obeyed, but he continued to preach in church.\\"Rupert Meyer\\", Living Space, Irish Jesuits Mayer spoke out against anti-Catholic baiting campaigns and fought against Nazi church policy. Since he believed that a Catholic could not be a National Socialist, conflict inevitably arose between him and the Nazis. He preached that Man must obey God more than men. His protests against the Nazis landed him several times in Landsberg prison. Mayer resolutely spoke out against the Nazi régime's evil in his lectures and sermons. On 5 June 1937, he was arrested and found himself in \\"protective custody\\" in Stadelheim Prison for six weeks. When he became the target of defamatory attacks on the part of the Nazis, his Jesuit superiors allowed him to return to the pulpit to defend himself against slanders that the Nazis made during his silence. He was re-arrested and served a sentence of five months. Mayer was arrested again 3 November 1939 and sent to Sachsenhausen concentration camp under the Kanzelparagraphen, a series of 19th-century laws that forbade the clergy to make political statements. He was released from there on the condition of a broad ban on preaching. The sixty- three year old priest developed heart problems, From late 1944, he was interned in Ettal Monastery, mainly because the Nazis were afraid that he would die in the concentration camp, and thus become a martyr. He remained there until liberated by the US forces in May 1945. A United States officer returned him to Munich, where he resumed his duties at St. Michael's Church. Mayer died on his feet on 1 November 1945 of a stroke, while he was celebrating 8:00 AM Mass, on the feast of All Saints' Day in St. Michael's in Munich. Accompanied by thousands of mourners, Mayer was first buried at the Jesuitenfriedhof in Pullach. Due to the steady stream of pilgrims, his remains were moved to Munich in 1948 and were reburied in the Unterkirche of the Bürgersaalkirche. ==Veneration== Rupert Mayer's grave in the Burgersaalkirche undercroft relic in Burgersaalkirche Since his death in 1945, Mayer's followers called for his beatification. In 1950, Cardinal Michael von Faulhaber opened the information process in the Archdiocese of Munich and Freising regarding the call to sanctity and virtues. In 1951, Jesuit provincial Otto Faller completed and formally forwarded the beatification information to Rome. In 1956, Pope Pius XII, who had personally known Fr. Rupert Mayer during his time as nuncio in Munich, awarded him the title Servant of God. Under Pope John XXIII, the beatification process was initiated, the results of which were formally accepted by Pope Paul VI in 1971. Under Pope John Paul II, the decree of 'heroic virtue' was issued in 1983. Mayer was beatified by Pope John Paul II on 3 May 1987 in Munich. His feast day is 3 November. The chapel of the Fordham University Lincoln Center Campus is named in honor of Rupert Mayer S.J.\\"Ignatian Week Closing Mass: Lincoln Center\\", Fordham News, 11 February 2018 ==Legacy== In Bavaria, numerous streets are named after Father Mayer. In 1954, the Cartell Rupert Mayer (CRM) was founded. It was a further development of the first Christliche Loge (CL) founded in Munich in 1946. The mediaeval Dombauhütten Logen may be considered its forerunner. In Pullach, Bavaria, a public school, a Realschule and a Gymnasium bear his name. In Cebu City, Philippines, Sacred Heart School – Ateneo de Cebu, has a section named after him. Another Jesuit school in the Philippines, Xavier University – Ateneo de Cagayan, has a high school section that bears his name. Regis Jesuit High School in Aurora, Colorado dedicated the chapel to him. In 2006 Fordham University dedicated a chapel in his name at their Lincoln Center campus in Manhattan, New York. St Rupert Mayer has a missionary school named after him in Zimbabwe. Another school in the Philippines, Ateneo de Davao University Senior High School, has a senior high school section named after him. ==Prayer of Rupert Mayer== The following text come from the song produced by Bukas Palad Music Ministry: > Lord, what You will let it be so > Where You will there we will go > What is Your will help us to know > > Lord, when You will the time is right > In You there's joy in strife > For Your will I'll give my life > > To ease Your burden brings no pain > To forego all for You is gain > As long as I in You remain > > REFRAIN: > Because You will it, it is best > Because You will it, we are blest > Till in Your hands our hearts find rest > Till in Your hands our hearts find rest ==References== ==External links== *Biography *Cartell Rupert Mayer *German stamp honouring Edith Stein and Rupert Mayer on the occasion of their beatification Category:1876 births Category:1945 deaths Category:German Jesuits Category:German beatified people Category:People condemned by Nazi courts Category:World War I chaplains Category:20th-century venerated Christians Category:German military chaplains Category:Roman Catholics in the German Resistance Category:Catholic saints and blesseds of the Nazi era Category:Clergy from Stuttgart Category:German amputees Category:Recipients of the Iron Cross (1914), 1st class Category:People from the Kingdom of Württemberg Category:Beatifications by Pope John Paul II Category:Venerated Catholics by Pope John Paul II ","title":"Rupert Mayer"},{"id":"3235897","text":"Significant ocean currents involved in the circulation of the North Pacific Subtropical and Subpolar gyres The North Pacific Gyre (NPG) or North Pacific Subtropical Gyre (NPSG), located in the northern Pacific Ocean, is one of the five major oceanic gyres. This gyre covers most of the northern Pacific Ocean. It is the largest ecosystem on Earth, located between the equator and 50° N latitude, and comprising 20 million square kilometers. The gyre has a clockwise circular pattern and is formed by four prevailing ocean currents: the North Pacific Current to the north, the California Current to the east, the North Equatorial Current to the south, and the Kuroshio Current to the west. It is the site of an unusually intense collection of man-made marine debris, known as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. The North Pacific Subtropical Gyre and the much smaller North Pacific Subpolar Gyre make up the two major gyre systems in the mid-latitudes of the Northern Pacific Ocean. This two-gyre circulation in the North Pacific is driven by the trade and westerly winds. This is one of the best examples of all of Earth’s oceans where these winds drive a two-gyre circulation. Physical characteristics like weak thermohaline circulation in the North Pacific and the fact that it is mostly blocked by land in the north, also help facilitate this circulation. As depth increases, these gyres in the North Pacific grow smaller and weaker, and the high pressure at the center of the Subtropical Gyre will migrate poleward and westward. == Physical oceanography == === Subtropical circulation in the North Pacific === Like all subtropical gyre systems, the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre is an anticyclone meaning the circulation is in a clockwise direction around its high pressure at the center because of its placement in the Northern Hemisphere. This circulation is also associated with equatorward Sverdrup transport and Ekman downwelling. Ekman transport causes water to flow toward the center of the gyre, creating a sloped sea-surface, and initiating geostrophic flow. Harald Sverdrup applied Ekman transport while including pressure gradient forces to develop a theory for Sverdrup transport. The Kuroshio Current is the narrow, strong westward boundary current of the subtropical circulation. This current influences the water column all the way to the bottom. The Kuroshio current flows in a northerly direction, then eventually flows further from the westward boundary where it then takes an eastward direction into the North Pacific. This eastward flowing current is then called the Kuroshio Extension. The North Pacific Current is located just north of the Subtropical Gyre and flows in an easterly direction. Also, known as the West Wind Drift or the Subarctic Current, the North Pacific Current also includes the westward flow of the southern boundary of the North Pacific Subpolar Gyre. The North Equatorial Current borders the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre on the south and flows in a westerly direction. The westward flow within the elongated tropical cyclonic circulation is also included in the North Equatorial current. The California Current System comprises the eastern boundary of the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre and flows south along the coast of California. Here coastal upwelling drives the eastern boundary current and an undercurrent that flows poleward. In the western region of the North Pacific, the surface of the Subtropical Gyre generally has a \\"C-shape\\". The Kuroshio current and Kuroshio Extension roughly from the outside of this \\"C-shape\\" where it then turns westwards into recirculation, where it then flows south parallel to the Kuroshio Current. From here the \\"C-shape\\" then flows eastward comprising the Subtropical Countercurrent at roughly 20 – 25⁰N, then finally the \\"C\\" wraps back towards the west forming the North Equatorial Current just south of 20⁰N. It is common for subtropical gyres to have this \\"C-shape\\" surface flow. The Subtropical Countercurrent is a shallow area of this \\"C\\"; at only about 250 dbar under the surface, circulation is a simpler closed, anticyclonic gyre. Narrow east-west frontal zones that cross the Pacific are less than 100 km wide. The Subarctic Frontal Zone or Subarctic Boundary, about 42⁰N, is fixed in the North Pacific Current. The Subarctic Frontal Zone, slightly south of the maximum westerly wind speeds, separates the North Pacific Subpolar Gyre from the Subtropical Gyre. In the central and eastern Pacific at roughly 32⁰N is the Subtropical Frontal Zone. Sometimes referred to as the Subtropical Convergence Zone, this frontal zone serves as the boundary between the west flowing North Equatorial Current from the North Pacific Current. With increasing depth in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre, it gets smaller in the western region near Japan and it also loses strength. The Subtropical Gyre does not exist below 1500 m below the surface with the exception of the Kuroshio Current and Extension regions. ==== Circulation dependence on depth ==== The North Pacific Subtropical Gyre diminishes spatially with increasing depth. Similar to all subtropical gyre systems, the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre shrinks towards its most energetic surface flows, in a northwestern direction between the Kuroshio Current and the Kuroshio Extension. This is drastic shrinkage from the surface to about 200 m below. At the surface, the boundary that separates the westward and eastward flows from south of 20⁰N to about 25 – 30⁰N at 200 m. The \\"C-shape\\" in the western region of the Subtropical Gyre, including the Subtropical Countercurrent, generally does not exist below 200 m. At about 1000 – 1500 m, the Subtropical Gyre is located entirely in the western region of the North Pacific near the Kuroshio Current and Kuroshio Extension. In the subtropical regions, flow is weak where influences from the Subtropical Gyre are minimal. Differences in steric heights over distances of 1000 km are on the order of 1 cm, rather than the differences of 10 cm within the area of the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre. == See also == * Ecosystem of the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre * Great Pacific Garbage Patch * Marine Pollution * North Atlantic Garbage Patch * Ocean current * South Atlantic Gyre == References == == External links == * Ocean currents Category:Pacific Ocean Category:Oceanic gyres ru:Северное Тихоокеанское течение sv:Nordpacifiska strömmen ","title":"North Pacific Gyre"},{"id":"3235901","text":"The Finlay River is a 402 km long river in north-central British Columbia flowing north and thence south from Thutade Lake in the Omineca Mountains to Williston Lake, the impounded waters of the Peace River formed by the completion of the W.A.C.

The first European to journey its length to its source was the fur trader and explorer Samuel Black in 1824. The river was the eastern half of the northern boundary of the Colony of British Columbia at the time of its creation in 1858, north of which was the North-Western Territory; the western half of the boundary was the Nass River and from 1862 to 1863 it was briefly the southern boundary of the Stickeen Territories (Stikine Territory) which had been formed from the North-Western Territory in response to the Peace and Stikine Gold Rushes and which was amalgamated with the Colony of British Columbia in the following year. ==Tributaries== *Firesteel River *Toodoggone River *Fox River *Kwadacha River *Paul River *Akie River *Ingenika River *Davis River *Mesilinka River *Osilinka River ==References== ==External links== *A book about the exploration of the Finlay River Category:Northern Interior of British Columbia Category:Rivers of the Omineca Mountains Category:Cassiar Mountains Category:Hudson's Bay Company trading posts ","title":"Finlay River"},{"id":"3235902","text":"Famine response can refer to: *Famine relief, the societal response to famine *Starvation response, the physiological and biochemical response to starvation ","title":"Famine response"},{"id":"3235908","text":"Dominie may refer to *Dominie, a Scottish term for a churchman or schoolteacher * A Minister of religion can be called a Dominie, Dom or Don *The military version of the De Havilland Dragon Rapide aircraft *The BAe Dominie trainer aircraft *\\"The Dominie\\", a fictional character in BBV audio dramas ","title":"Dominie (disambiguation)"},{"id":"3235923","text":"Fluorene , or 9H-fluorene is an organic compound with the formula (C6H4)2CH2. It forms white crystals that exhibit a characteristic, aromatic odor similar to that of naphthalene. It has a violet fluorescence, hence its name. For commercial purposes it is obtained from coal tar. It is insoluble in water and soluble in many organic solvents. Although sometimes classified as a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, the five-membered ring has no aromatic properties. Fluorene is mildly acidic. ==Synthesis, structure, and reactivity== Although fluorene is obtained from coal tar, it can also be prepared by dehydrogenation of diphenylmethane. Alternatively, it can be prepared by the reduction of fluorenone with zinc.Fittig, Rud. (1873), \\"Ueber einen neuen Kohlenwasserstoff aus dem Diphenylenketon\\" Ber. Dtsch. Chem. Ges. volume 6, p. 187. The fluorene molecule is nearly planar,D. M. Burns, John Iball (1954), Molecular Structure of Fluorene Nature volume 173, p. 635. although each of the two benzene rings is coplanar with the central carbon 9. ===Acidity=== The C9-H sites of the fluorene ring are weakly acidic (pKa = 22.6 in DMSO.) Deprotonation gives the stable fluorenyl anion, nominally C13H9−, which is aromatic and has an intense orange colour. The anion is a nucleophile. Electrophiles react with it by adding to the 9-position. The purification of fluorene exploits its acidity and the low solubility of its sodium derivative in hydrocarbon solvents. Both protons can be removed from C9. For example, 9,9-fluorenyldipotassium can be obtained by treating fluorene with potassium metal in boiling dioxane.. ===Ligand properties=== Fluorene and its derivatives can be deprotonated to give ligands akin to cyclopentadienide. Kaminsky precatalyst for producing syndiotactic polypropylene. ==Uses== Fluorene is a precursor to other fluorene compounds; the parent species has few applications. Fluorene-9-carboxylic acid is a precursor to pharmaceuticals. Oxidation of fluorene gives fluorenone, which is nitrated to give commercially useful derivatives. 9-Fluorenylmethyl chloroformate (Fmoc chloride) is used to introduce the 9-fluorenylmethyl carbamate (Fmoc) protecting group on amines in peptide synthesis. Polyfluorene polymers (where carbon 7 of one unit is linked to carbon 2 of the next one, displacing two hydrogens) are electrically conductive and electroluminescent, and have been much investigated as a luminophore in organic light-emitting diodes. ===Fluorene dyes=== Fluorene dyes are well developed. Most are prepared by condensation of the active methylene group with carbonyls. 2-Aminofluorene, 3,6-bis-(dimethylamino)fluorene, and 2,7-diiodofluorene are precursors to dyes. ==See also== *CataCXium F sulf *Fluorenol *Indecainide *PD-137889 ==References== ==External links== * Fluorene in the National Institute of Standards and Technology database.

The Hardballer was the first entirely stainless steel 1911 pattern pistol. Other features included adjustable rear sights and a lengthened grip safety. ==Overview== The Hardballer derives its name from round-nose hardball G.I. ammunition (solid 230 grain Full Metal Jacketed bullets). This is the round the pistol was designed to shoot. The Hardballer series of pistols all share a brushed stainless steel finish and a wide target style trigger with adjustable trigger stop. The later Galena-made pistols have an elongated \\"beavertail\\" grip safety and a beveled magazine well. ==Variants== * AMT Hardballer: an all stainless steel version of the Colt Gold Cup, fitted with Micro rear sights. * AMT Combat Government: was developed as a sports pistol but in 1978 AMT marketed the Combat Government, an M1911 clone with fixed sights for police departments. Since 1985, this model has been called the Government with the term \\"Combat\\" omitted. * AMT Longslide: a version with an extended barrel, introduced in 1980. It has the same qualities as the Hardballer but with slide and barrel lengthened by . * AMT Skipper: a compact version of the Hardballer introduced in 1980. It features a barrel. In 1984, the Skipper disappeared from AMT's range. * AMT Commando: originally offered by AMT then improved and reintroduced in 2000 (this date in question) under the Galena Industries brand. The original AMT Commando was a barreled version and did not have a loaded chamber indicator nor beavertail grip safety. The improved Commando is a compact model of the Government with a barrel but retaining the frame of the Government model. It is chambered in .40 S&W; and has an 8-round magazine capacity. * AMT Accelerator: a Galena-made Longslide chambered for the .400 Corbon cartridge featuring a barrel and an elongated beavertail. * AMT Javelina: a Longslide variant chambered in the 10mm Auto caliber with an 8-round capacity magazine. ==In popular culture== The Longslide version was the pistol used by Arnold Schwarzenegger's Terminator character in the 1984 film, The Terminator. The pistol used by Schwazenegger also comes with a laser sight. In the Hitman video game series, custom AMT Hardballers (called \\"Silverballers\\" from Hitman: Contracts onwards), singular and dual, are Agent 47's signature weapons. In the movie The Phantom, Billy Zane portrays a mysterious hero who is armed with two matching AMT Hardballer Longslide .45s in this 1996 cult classic. In the video game killer7 KAEDE Smith uses a scoped Hardballer. In the video game Resident Evil 4, the AMT Longslide makes an appearance, named the Killer 7. It is the second \\"Magnum\\" type pistol obtainable in the game.

A language grammar is scannerless if it uses a single formalism to express both the lexical (word level) and phrase level structure of the language. Dividing processing into a lexer followed by a parser is more modular; scannerless parsing is primarily used when a clear lexer–parser distinction is unneeded or unwanted. Examples of when this is appropriate include TeX, most wiki grammars, makefiles, simple application-specific scripting languages, and Raku. == Advantages == * Only one metalanguage is needed * Non-regular lexical structure is handled easily * \\"Token classification\\" is unneeded which removes the need for design accommodations such as \\"the lexer hack\\" and language reserved words (such as \\"while\\" in C) * Grammars can be compositional (can be merged without human intervention) == Disadvantages == * Since the lexical scanning and syntactic parsing are combined, the resulting parser tends to be more complicated and thus harder to understand and debug. The same will hold for the associated grammar, if a grammar is used to generate the parser. * The resulting parser tends to be significantly less efficient than a lexer-parser pipeline with regard to both time and memory. == Implementations == * SGLR is a parser for the modular Syntax Definition Formalism SDF, and is part of the ASF+SDF Meta-Environment and the Stratego/XT program transformation system. * JSGLR, a pure Java implementation of SGLR, also based on SDF. * TXL supports character-level parsing. * dparser generates ANSI C code for scannerless GLR parsers. * Spirit allows for both scannerless and scanner-based parsing. * SBP is a scannerless parser for boolean grammars (a superset of context-free grammars), written in Java. * Laja is a two phase scannerless parser generator with support for mapping the grammar rules into objects, written in Java. * The Raku Grammars feature of the general purpose programming language Raku. * PyParsing is a scannerless parser written in pure Python. * META II Has built in token parsers functions. * TREE-META Like META II also is scannerless having builtin lexer functions. * CWIC Compiler for Writing and Implementing Compilers. Has token rules as part of its language. Rules in CWIC were compiled into boolean functions returning success or failure. ==Notes== * This is because parsing at the character level makes the language recognized by the parser a single context-free language defined on characters, as opposed to a context-free language of sequences of strings in regular languages.

The city had a population of 11,662 (in 131,52 km²) as of the 2001 census. It was first mentioned in 1186 and has been the economic centre of the Ybbstal valley since the 14th century. ==Sites and attractions== Innenstadt: Waidhofen's Old City has many late medieval houses and public buildings enclosed within the old city walls. Several Gothic courtyards and arcades are still present, as are many renovated facades in the Biedermeier, Neo-Renaissance and Neo-Baroque styles. Parish church of Waidhofen an der Ybbs Stadtpfarrkirche: One of Waidhofen's largest and most historic churches, the Stadtpfarrkirche was built between 1470 and 1510. The interior of the church is home to a Gothic winged altar, transplanted to the site from another church in the 1930s. The church's wooden gate dates from the time of original construction. Rothschildschloss: A castle has existed on this site inside the Old City since the twelfth century, although the oldest portions of today's building was built around 1400. The building was home to the region's Bavarian governors out of Freising for centuries and thus the administrative center of the region. The castle is named after the most important former owner, the banker Albert Salomon Anselm Freiherr von Rothschild (1844-1910). An extensive renovation in the late nineteenth century again altered the character of the castle, as did a redesign in 2006/2007 that made use of contrasting modern materials like glass and steel. In 2007, the Rothschildschoss was home to the Lower Austrian Provincial Exhibition and today the castle houses a park, gift shop, and tourism center. The building also houses the 5e-Museum, named after the five elements - fire, water, wood, earth, and metal - that the museum focuses on thematically. During Advent, the castle and its grounds host the town's Christmas market, with crafts, food, punch, music, etc. Once a month during the school year, the castle's interior is transformed into \\"Crystal Club\\". Stadtturm (City Tower): This square clock tower is one of the foremost symbols of the city and, at 50 m high, is clearly visible for many miles. It was constructed in the 1530s with the spoils from the expulsion of the invading Turkish hordes. The inscription, dating from 1932, reads \\"In the year 1532 the citizens, smithies, and farmers of Waidhofen forced the Turkish to flee and built this tower in remembrance.\\" One of the faces of the tower is set permanently to 11:45 to commemorate the hour of the citizens' victory. Ybbsturm and Stadttor (Ybbs Tower and City Gate): Another of Waidhofen's towers, the Ybbsturm is the only surviving medieval gate tower in the city walls. The city's motto is inscribed here in Latin: Ferrum chalybsque urbis nutrimenta - \\"Iron and Steel Nourish the City.\\" Mariensäule: This baroque column and figure of the Virgin Mary in the center of the city was constructed in 1665 as a symbol of the Counter-Reformation. Schwarzbachviadukt: This historic bridge from the late nineteenth century crosses the valley of the Schwarzbach (Black Stream) just outside the city center. It is used by the narrow-gauge Ybbstalbahn (Ybbs Valley Railway), which formerly ran from Waidhofen to Lunz am See, but now provides a shortened service across the city. Krautberg: This small hill just a short walk from town, easily identifiable by its large white cross, offers a view of the old city. From the Stadt train station on Reichenauer Strasse, cross the train tracks and climb the path called the Reinhold Klaus Weg. Wallfahrtskirche Basilika Sonntagberg: There is a large and important Catholic pilgrimage site located just north of Waidhofen. The baroque church, built in 1706–1732, is clearly visible across the surrounding area and has had the status of a minor basilica since 1964.

Bennett Dam in 1968. Prior to that, the Parsnip joined with the Finlay River to form the Peace at Finlay Forks, with both sharing an alignment along the Rocky Mountain Trench. ==Name origin== The river's name derives from the abundance of cow-parsnip (Heracleum lanatum), also known as Indian rhubarb, which grows along its banks. ==History== The Parsnip is of historical significance as forming part of the route Alexander MacKenzie took in his epic journey to the Pacific Ocean in 1793. Fish populations and their protozoan and metazoan parasites in the headwater areas of the McGregor River (Pacific drainage) and of the Parsnip River (Arctic drainage) were the subject of studies carried out in the 1970s concerning the proposed diversion of waters across the continental divide. Three parasites (Ceratomyxa shasta, Cryptobia salmositica, and Haemogregarina irkalukpiki) were identified as posing the greatest threat to the fisheries resources of the immediate area and also to the downstream areas.

It has detailed rules assigning jurisdiction for the dispute to be heard and governs the recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments. ==Instruments== Five legal instruments together form the Brussels Regime. All five legal instruments are broadly similar in content and application, with differences in their territory of application. They establish a general rule that individuals are to be sued in their state of domicile and then proceed to provide a list of exceptions. The instruments further provide for the recognition of judgments made in other countries. ===Brussels Convention (1968)=== Recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial cases was originally accomplished within the European Communities by the 1968 Brussels convention: a treaty signed by the then six members of the Communities. This treaty was amended on several occasions and was almost completely superseded by a regulation adopted in 2001, the Brussels I regulation.

The Lugano Convention served to extend the recognition regime to EFTA member state who are not eligible to sign the Brussels Convention. Other than the original signatories–three of which left EFTA to join the EU in 1995–only Poland has subsequently acceded to the Lugano Convention. Liechtenstein, the only state to accede to the EFTA after 1988, has not signed either the 1988 Convention or its successor, the 2007 Lugano Convention. The convention is fully superseded by a 2007 version. ===Brussels I Regulation (2001)=== The Brussels I Regulation of 2001 was the primary piece of legislation in the Brussels framework from 2002 until January 2015. It substantially replaced the 1968 Brussels Convention, and applied to all EU member states excluding Denmark, which has a full opt-out from implementing regulations under the area of freedom, security and justice. It came into effect on 1 March 2002.European Commission web site, Judicial Cooperation in Civil Matters - Acquis JHA 2003 (Justice and Home Affairs). Consolidated version. Retrieved on 28 August 2006. The regulation is fully superseded by a recast Brussels I regulation. ===Agreement with Denmark=== In 2005, Denmark signed an international agreement with the European Community to apply the provisions of the 2001 Regulation between the EU and Denmark. The 2005 agreement applies a modified form of the 2001 Regulation between Denmark and the rest of the EU.

While the former purpose was achieved in 2010 with the ratification of all EFTA member states (bar Liechtenstein which never signed the 1988 Convention), no EU member has yet acceded to the convention on behalf of its extra-EU territories. The 2007 Convention is substantially the same as the 2001 Brussels I regulation: the main difference being that the word \\"Regulation\\" is replaced with the word \\"Convention\\" throughout the text. Furthermore, the convention has a slightly different definition of the concept \\"court\\" and the 2007 convention is not adapted to the recast of the Brussels regulation.

The UK has indicated it will seek participation in the Lugano convention upon Brexit, and has secured support from Iceland, Norway and Switzerland for accession. ===Brussels I Regulation (recast)=== An amendment to the Brussels I Regulation, covering maintenance obligations, was adopted in 2008. Neither Denmark nor the United Kingdom participated in the regulation, though Denmark notified the Commission of its acceptance of the amendment in January 2009. In 2012, the EU institutions adopted a recast Brussels I Regulation which replaced the 2001 regulation with effect from 10 January 2015.See the second paragraph of Article 81 Regulation (EU) no. 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2012 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (recast) OJ L 351, 20.12.2012, p. 1 The recast regulation now also applies to jurisdiction regarding non EU residents, it abolishes formalities for recognition of judgments and simplifies the procedure for a court chosen by the parties to commence proceedings (even if proceedings have started in another member state already). In December 2012 Denmark notified the Commission of its decision to implement the contents of 2012 regulation. The Lugano Convention Standing committee considered amending the Lugano Convention in accordance with the recast, but \\"made no recommendation on the possible amendment of the Lugano Convention and did not decide on any further steps.\\" In 2014, the EU amended the Brussels I Regulation to clarify provisions regarding two courts which are \\"common to several member states\\": the Unified Patent Court and the Benelux Court of Justice jurisdiction. Denmark again notified the EU that it would apply the amendments. The Lugano Convention Standing Committee considered amending the Lugano Convention with respect to the unitary patent and Unified patent court, but decided to \\"wait for the results of further study\\". ===Effect in the UK=== Until 1 February 2020 all instruments applied in the UK as a result of its EU membership. After that date, under the conditions of the Brexit withdrawal agreement, the instruments remain applicable there, despite Brexit, during a transition period. ==Scope and content== The Brussels Regime covers legal disputes of a civil or commercial nature. In 1978, the convention was amended to include the sentence: \\"It shall not extend, in particular, to revenue, customs or administrative matters.\\" The 2012 Regulation further specifies that the regulation shall not extend to \\"the liability of the State for acts and omissions in the exercise of State authority (acta iure imperii).\\" There are some exceptions limiting the scope of this. Where the principal matter of a dispute is one of family law, bankruptcy or insolvency, social security, or relates to arbitration, the case is not subject to the rules. The regulation aims at jurisdiction, i.e., determining which court or courts will have the ability to take the case. That does not mean that the applicable law will be the law of the court. It is possible and frequent to have a national court applying foreign law. In general, it is the domicile of the defendant that determines which of the courts have jurisdiction in a given case. The regime prescribes that, subject to specific rules set out in the various instruments, a person (legal or natural) may only be sued in the member state in which he or she has its habitual residence or domicile. This is determined by the law of the court hearing the case, so that a person can be domiciled in more than one state simultaneously. However, \\"domicile\\" does not have the same meaning as that given to it by common law.Both Ireland and the United Kingdom–the only common law countries to sign the Brussels Convention–enacted national laws which define the term \\"domicile\\" in terms of residence rather than the common law concept of domicile. In Ireland, the Fifth Schedule of the Jurisdiction of Courts and Enforcement of Judgments (European Communities) Act 1988 and in the UK, Part V of the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982 Originally the regime only applied to individuals domiciled in the European Economic Area (EEA) or Switzerland. However, the 2012 Regulation also sets out rules applicable to suing individuals domiciled elsewhere. Until that regulation takes effect, if a defendant is domiciled outside the EEA, then the Regime does not apply and the national court hearing the case is left to determine jurisdiction based on the traditional rules otherwise governing such questions in their legal system. Article 4 also allows a person domiciled in any member state to take advantage of another member state's exorbitant bases of jurisdiction on the same basis as a national of that state. This is useful in cases where a member state, such as France, allows its nationals to sue anyone in their courts, so that someone domiciled in a member state like Finland may sue someone domiciled in a non-member state like Canada, in the courts of a third party member state, like France, where the defendant may have assets. The Brussels Convention and the Brussels I Regulation are both subject to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice (ECJ, now known as CJEU) on questions of interpretation. The Lugano Convention does not require non-EU states to refer questions of interpretation to the ECJ, but has a protocol regarding \\"uniform interpretation\\" of the convention, requiring courts \\"pay due account to the principles laid down by any relevant decision\\" and allowing for the exchange of relevant judgments. Nevertheless, various divergences have arisen between member states in the interpretation of the Lugano Convention. The Brussels Regime generally allows jurisdiction clauses in contracts, which preserves the right of parties to reach agreement at the time of contracting as to which court should govern any dispute. After the 2012 regulation enters into force, such a decision should in principle be respected, even if a court outside the Brussels Regime states is selected and is in compliance with the 2005 Hague Choice of Court convention. The Regime applies only in the courts where the Lugano Convention is applicable, so there is nothing to prevent a non-party state from allowing parallel proceedings in their courts, although this may contribute to a finding of forum non conveniens, which would in practice halt an action. ==See also== * Spider in the web doctrine * Cross- border injunction * Enforcement of European patents * Inter-American convention on extraterritorial validity of foreign judgments and arbitral awards * Implementation in UK law ** Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982 ** Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1991 * Rome Convention the choice of law to be made in contract disputes ==References== ==External links== ; Instruments * Regulation (EU) 1215/2012 and Regulation (EC) 44/2001 * 2005 EU- Denmark agreement * 1968 Brussels convention (parties) * 1988 Lugano Convention (parties) * 2007 Lugano Convention (parties) ;Case law * Case law reports on the Lugano Conventions * Case-law relating to the Brussels and Lugano Conventions * Landmark cases ** Athanasios Kalfelis v Bankhaus Schröder, Münchmeyer, Hengst and Co. and others Case 189/87 ** Gesellschaft für Antriebstechnik mbH & Co.

It is related to, but independent from, Far Eastern University. FEU-NRMF created some of the finest names in the field of Philippine healthcare: seven Philippine Medical Association Presidents, six Presidents of the Philippine College of Surgeons, four Secretaries of Health, and one President of the World Medical Association. ==History== In 1952, the Institute of Medicine was established. The medical school was a dream of the founder of Far Eastern University, Dr. Nicanor Reyes, Sr. He was killed in World War II in 1946 in the battle for the liberation of Manila and never saw his dream realized. In the same year, the Board of Trustees under the chairmanship of Don Jose Cojuangco commissioned a Medical School Committee composed of Drs. Lauro H. Panganiban, Treasurer of FEU, Aureo F. Gutierrez, Director of the FEU Medical Clinic and Ricardo L. Alfonso to recruit faculty members and establish an Institute of Medicine. Faculties were contacted and equipment and facilities readied and in June 1952, the Institute of Medicine opened its doors to its first students. FEU-NRMF was founded by Dr. Nicanor B. Reyes, Sr. On October 22, 1955, the FEU Hospital opened its doors as a charitable institution and provided hospital training for students in medicine and nursing. It was erected on a trapezoidal lot at the northeastern part of the campus in Morayta Street (now Nicanor B. Reyes Sr. St.). It was built and equipped at a cost of ₱1.5 billion and designed by architect Felipe Mendoza in collaboration with the hospital committee chaired by Lauro Panganiban, M.D., Nicanor M. Reyes Jr., Angel Palanca, and Ricardo Alfonso, M.D., who later became the first hospital director. Fe del Mundo, M.D., later named as National Scientist, headed the Department of Pediatrics; Carlos Sevilla, M.D., chaired the Ophthalmology Department; Gloria Aragon, M.D., the OB-GYN Department; Liborio Gomez, M.D., the Pathology Department; Jose Tirona, M.D., the X-Ray Department; Perpetuo Gutierrez, M.D., the Medicine Department; Jesus Nolasco, M.D., the Physiology Department. In 1970, the Institute of Medicine, School of Medical Technology, FEU Hospital and the Student Health Service Clinic were converted into a non-stock, non-profit educational foundation known as the FEU Dr. Nicanor B. Reyes Medical Foundation. ==West Fairview Campus and Medical Complex== On December 22, 1996, Dr. Josephine S. Cojuangco- Reyes (NRMF chairman and former FEU president) presided over the groundbreaking of the new P500 million modern medical school and hospital, assisted by Ricardo L. Alfonso, M.D., former FEU Hospital Director and I. M. Dean, and Philip S. Chua, M.D., FACS, FPCS, president (1995-1999) and Chairman (2002-2004) of the FEU-DNR School of Medicine Alumni Foundation, USA, and member of the FEUNRMF Board of Trustees (1998-2008). In 2001, the new facilities of the Medical Foundation were formally inaugurated. The ceremony was attended by former President Corazon Aquino as guest of honor. FEU-NRMF Medical Center is the only Level 3 university hospital situated in District 5, Quezon City. The hospital operates with 300 Hospital Beds, 10 Clinical Departments, 10 Accredited Residency Training Programs, and 6 Accredited Fellowship Programs. Its Medical Center is also accredited by PhilHealth as a Center of Excellence and the Philippine Council for Health Research and Development (PCHRD) has named the school as a Center of Excellence in Research. At the last meeting of the Association of Philippine Medical Colleges, CHED presented the five-year summary of board passing rank of medical schools. FEU-IM ranked third overall with the highest passing averages.

He is most famous for bringing Iroquois concerns before the League of Nations in the 1920s. == Early life == Levi General was raised and educated as a traditional Cayuga, participating actively in Longhouse ceremonies. In addition to his first language, Cayuga, he also spoke the other Iroquois dialects. He worked as a lumberjack in the Allegheny Mountains in western New York and Pennsylvania. An accident forced him to return and he began to farm near Millpond, in the vicinity of Ohsweken on the Six Nations Reserve, where he married and had four daughters. ==Speaker of the Six Nations Council== In 1917, General became hereditary chief of the Cayuga with the title \\"'Deskaheh'\\",\\"Deskaheh\\" is an Iroquois Confederacy chiefly title, but the press mistakenly applied it as a given name, which stuck. Ronald Niezen, \\"Recognizing Indigenism: Canadian Unity and the International Movement of Indigenous Peoples,\\" Comparative Studies in Society and History 42, no. 1 (2000). meaning \\"more than eleven\\". Deskaheh travelled to London in August, 1921 with attorney George P. Decker, who was hired by the Six Nations as counsel. Because the Canadian government would have denied him permission to travel, the Six Nations Confederacy issued their own passport for Deskaheh at the advice of Decker. Deskaheh appeared at the Hippodrome \\"in full regalia\\" and also distributed a pamphlet entitled \\"Petition and Case of the Six Nations of the Grand River\\". Winston Churchill, British undersecretary for the colonies at the time, stated the petition should be returned to the Canadian government, so Decker and Deskaheh returned to the United States. In 1922, the two men went to Washington, DC and gained the support of the Netherlands' minister of foreign affairs, H. A. van Karnebeck, who sent their petition to the League of Nations' Secretary- General's office. They also gained the support of the Swiss Bureau International pour la Défense des Indigènes. In 1923, Canadian officials built Royal Canadian Mounted Police barracks on Six Nations Grand River lands, conducted searches of private homes, and prohibited the Indians from cutting wood for fuel (while allowing others to do so), intensifying the Indians' desire to seek protection from the British crown. Deskaheh travelled to Rochester, NY and began strategizing with Decker to ask the League of Nations to place sanctions on Canada. On July 14, 1923, Deskaheh and Decker sailed to Geneva, Switzerland. Decker returned to the U.S. after a brief time but communicated with Deskaheh frequently by mail. Meanwhile, Deskaheh remained in Switzerland for eighteen months, lecturing before large audiences in Geneva, Bern, Lausanne, Lucerne, Winterthur, and Zurich. In his lectures, he reminded European colonizers of the new world of their obligations under the two row wampum, the most significant pact made between the Iroquois and Europeans. His eloquence, persistence, and ability to speak French helped win the support of some nations, including Ireland, Panama, Persia, and Estonia. Modern historian Laurence Hauptman wrote that while Deskaheh's lectures generated a warm reception by the Swiss people, they were not effective in changing British or Canadian positions. On September 17, 1924, Governor-General Julian Byng, 1st Viscount Byng of Vimy mandated the Six Nations Confederacy Council at Ohsweken be replaced with an elected council as described by Canada's Indian Act. On October 7, as the result of a report by Andrew Thorburn Thompson who had been asked by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to investigate the situation, the RCMP dissolved the traditional government of the Six Nations, stealing important documents and wampums and declaring an immediate election to displace the traditional government. Although Deskaheh became even more outspoken as a result of these events, even writing to King George V directly, he was unable to make headway and was never able to meet his original goal of speaking to the League of Nations, although he left a copy of a proclamation at their offices in Geneva before he left on January 3, 1925. Deskaheh lived his last six months in Rochester, delivering speeches including his most famous one on March 10, 1925 via the local Rochester radio station. In this speech he made a statement regarding policies of \\"forced acculturation\\" that has been much-quoted since: > \\"Over in Ottawa, they call that policy \\"Indian Advancement\\". Over in > Washington, they call it \\"Assimilation.\\" We who would be the helpless > victims say it is tyranny. If this must go on to the bitter end, we would > rather that you come with your guns and poison gases and get rid of us that > way. Do it openly and above board.\\" == Death and legacy == Deskaheh was staying at the home of Chief Clinton Rickard on the Tuscarora Reservation during the final months of pneumonia that followed a bad cold he had contracted in Europe. \\"He sent for his traditional medicine man from the Six Nations Reserve in Canada. But the medicine man was not allowed across the border. The U.S. had just passed the Immigration Law of 1924, which denied entry to anyone who did not speak English.\\" On his deathbed, \\"Deskaheh told Rickard to 'Fight for the line.'\\" Chief Rickard went on to found the Indian Defense League in 1925, to defend \\"the right of free passage for Aboriginal people\\". Deskaheh was buried on June 30 on the Six Nations Reserve, with two thousand mourners accompanying his casket to the cemetery after a ceremony at Sour Spring Longhouse. Modern Iroquois consider Deskaheh a great patriot, but some also hold him responsible for the later retaliation of the Canadian government against the tribe. ==Notes== ==References== * Doctoral Dissertation, UMI Number 3337613. * * * . == Further reading == Chief Deskaheh delivers an address in London on his way to address the League of Nations in Geneva regarding protection of the Iroquois against subjugation by Canada. * * ==External links== * *Deskaheh, Levi General - Iroquois Patriot's Fight for International Recognition * Photograph of Deskaheh and attorney George P.

Pseudoconvex sets are important, as they allow for classification of domains of holomorphy. Let :G\\\\subset {\\\\mathbb{C}}^n be a domain, that is, an open connected subset. One says that G is pseudoconvex (or Hartogs pseudoconvex) if there exists a continuous plurisubharmonic function \\\\varphi on G such that the set :\\\\\\\\{ z \\\\in G \\\\mid \\\\varphi(z) < x \\\\\\\\} is a relatively compact subset of G for all real numbers x. In other words, a domain is pseudoconvex if G has a continuous plurisubharmonic exhaustion function. Every (geometrically) convex set is pseudoconvex. When G has a C^2 (twice continuously differentiable) boundary, this notion is the same as Levi pseudoconvexity, which is easier to work with. More specifically, with a C^2 boundary, it can be shown that G has a defining function; i.e., that there exists \\\\rho: \\\\mathbb{C}^n \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R} which is C^2 so that G=\\\\\\\\{\\\\rho <0 \\\\\\\\}, and \\\\partial G =\\\\\\\\{\\\\rho =0\\\\\\\\}. Now, G is pseudoconvex iff for every p \\\\in \\\\partial G and w in the complex tangent space at p, that is, : abla \\\\rho(p) w = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\rho (p)}{ \\\\partial z_j }w_j =0 , we have :\\\\sum_{i,j=1}^n \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 \\\\rho(p)}{\\\\partial z_i \\\\partial \\\\bar{z_j} } w_i \\\\bar{w_j} \\\\geq 0. If G does not have a C^2 boundary, the following approximation result can come in useful. Proposition 1 If G is pseudoconvex, then there exist bounded, strongly Levi pseudoconvex domains G_k \\\\subset G with C^\\\\infty (smooth) boundary which are relatively compact in G, such that :G = \\\\bigcup_{k=1}^\\\\infty G_k. This is because once we have a \\\\varphi as in the definition we can actually find a C∞ exhaustion function. ==The case n = 1== In one complex dimension, every open domain is pseudoconvex.

Aboriginal Australians of various nations or tribes have lived in South Australia for at least thirty thousand years, while British colonists arrived in the 19th century to establish a free colony. The South Australia Act, 1834 created the Province of South Australia, built according to the principles of systematic colonisation, with no convict settlers; after the colony nearly went bankrupt, the South Australia Act 1842 gave the British Government full control of South Australia as a Crown Colony. After some amendments to the form of government in the intervening years, South Australia became a self-governing colony in 1857 with the ratification of the Constitution Act 1856, and the Parliament of South Australia was formed. Meanwhile, European explorers were sent deep into the interior, discovering some pastoral land, but mainly large tracts of desert terrain. Sheep and other livestock were imported, wheat and other crops were grown where possible and a thriving viticulture industry was established. Copper was discovered. German Lutheran refugees set up mission stations and developed the wine industry in the Barossa Valley. The colony became a cradle of democratic and land reform in Australia. It was the first place in the world to institute the system of land registration known as Torrens title in 1858. Women were granted the vote in the 1890s. South Australia became a State of the Commonwealth of Australia in 1901 following a vote to federate with the other British colonies of Australia. While it has a smaller population than the eastern States, South Australia has often been at the vanguard of political and social change in Australia. Since World War II refugees and other migrants have boosted both the size and the multicultural nature of the population. ==Aboriginal settlement== Aboriginal Family Travelling by W.A. Cawthorne. The first people to occupy the area now known as South Australia were Aboriginal Australians. Their presence in northern Australia began at least 65,000 years ago with the arrival of the first of their ancestors by land-bridge from what is now Indonesia. Their descendants moved south and occupied all areas of Australia, including the future South Australia.Geoffrey Blainey; A Very Short History of the World; Penguin Books; 2004; Temporary campsites in the Roxby dunefields have been dated to 19,000 years ago, and Aboriginal people have continuously occupied South Australian deserts since at least that time. Conservative estimates of the Aboriginal population of South Australia by the time of European contact are around 15,000 with a larger concentration in the southern part of the region. Aboriginal society was made up of small bands, usually numbering around 25, which lived together on a daily basis and shared a particular range of land. The bands comprised one or more extended families, but the membership was fluid and would change depending on available food resources and personal circumstances. Several bands made up one clan, which also had a defined territory and was united by claimed descent from a single ancestor, and several clans made up one tribe, of which there were around 48 in South Australia by the time of European settlement. There was little uniting the clans of an Aboriginal tribe aside from their common language. The Aboriginal tribal groups all had Dreamings, which were religious traditions tying them to the land. The Dreamings serve as both stories about their ancestors and as the foundation of their societal laws. For example, for the Ngarrindjeri of the lower Murray River, the ancestral hero Ngurunderi fashioned the physical world and gave the people their laws. At the end of his life he traveled to Kangaroo Island, where he passed on to the sky-world. As a result, the Ngarrindjeri viewed the island as a stepping stone for the soul of a dead person to the under world. It was seen as a psychic landscape, not existing in a physical sense, and as a result the island was uninhabited by Aboriginal Australians when Europeans first arrived, and the archaeological record suggests that humans had last lived on Kangaroo Island 4000 years ago. ==European exploration== The first Europeans to explore South Australia were the crew of a Dutch vessel, the Gulden Zeepaert, led by Captain François Thijssen. From Cape Leeuwin in Western Australia, the ship followed the southern coast of Australia east for 1,000 miles, reaching the edge of the Great Australian Bight. He named the whole area he'd explored Nuyts Land, after Pieter Nuyts, a distinguished passenger on the ship. Encounter Bay, 1847 In 1801–02 Matthew Flinders led the first circumnavigation of Australia aboard , a Royal Navy survey ship to verify that the eastern colony of New South Wales and the western land called New Holland were part of the same landmass. In March 1802 he reached Kangaroo Island, and was surprised to find it uninhabited. French Captain Nicolas Baudin was also on a survey mission in 1802, independently charting the southern coast of the Australian continent with the French naval ships the Géographe and the Naturaliste. The British and French expeditions sighted each other on 8 April 1802, and despite believing that France and Britain were still at war at the time (neither knew that the War of the Second Coalition had ended), they met peacefully at Encounter Bay. Following the discovery of Kangaroo Island by Flinders, lawless sealers known as \\"Straitsmen\\" (they mainly lived on the islands of the Bass Strait) came to the island. Their main work was hunting seals and whales. Once they had become established on the island, to satisfy their need for wives the sealers kidnapped Aboriginal women from Tasmania and the mainland and brought them there. By 1820, there were reportedly nine sealers living on the island with Aboriginal wives, and by the mid-1820s as many as 30 of them. The \\"wife- collecting trips\\" to the mainland were violent affairs, sometimes involving killing the women's husbands. Charles Sturt Charles Sturt led an expedition from New South Wales in 1829, which followed first the Murrumbidgee River into a \\"broad and noble river\\", which he named the Murray River. His party then followed this river to its junction with the Darling River and continued down river on to Lake Alexandrina, where the Murray meets the sea. He wrote: Sturt recommended further examination of the area, and New South Wales Governor Ralph Darling sent Captain Collet Barker to carry out a survey of the area in 1831. After swimming across the mouth of the Murray River alone, Barker was killed by Aboriginals (Sturt thought this might have been out of revenge for the atrocities committed by sealers). Despite this, his more detailed survey led Sturt to conclude: While traveling through the lower regions of the Murray, Sturt also wrote that he was surprised by the large number of Aboriginal Australians he encountered, but the Aboriginal population of the region was struck by an epidemic at the same time as Sturt's expedition (likely smallpox), leading to a much smaller native population when colonists arrived seven years later. ==British preparation for establishing a colony== 1835 advertisement In 1828 Robert Gouger and Edward Gibbon Wakefield were both looking to start a colony based on free settlement. Gouger met with Wakefield (who was still in prison at the time) in January 1829, and Wakefield suggested that instead of granting free land to settlers as had happened in other colonies, the colony should use the principle of \\"the universal sale of land instead of land grants, and the exclusive employment of the purchasers' moneys to promote emigration\\". (Trove catalogue entry here) Gouger established the National Colonisation Society in February 1830, and although initially the proposal didn't attract much attention, after Sturt's discovery of the Murray River became public knowledge, its prospects were revived. By December, the Gulf St Vincent was being pitched as the location of the colony, and the National Colonisation Society put their proposal to the Colonial Office in May 1831. === Founding organisations and laws, 1834–1836 === The South Australian Association, with the aid of such figures as George Grote, William Molesworth and the Duke of Wellington persuaded the British Parliament to pass the South Australia Act, 1834. The Act defined the province of South Australia as being \\"that part of Australia which lies between the meridians of the one hundred and thirty-second and one hundred and forty-first degrees of east longitude, and between the southern ocean and the twenty-six degrees of south latitude, together with all and every the islands adjacent thereto, and the bays and gulphs\\". South Australia thus became the only colony authorised by an Act of Parliament. The colony and its capital city were named prior to settlement. The planners and founders of South Australia called for the colony to be their ideal embodiment of what they perceived to be the best qualities of British society. They sought: to prevent a reliance of convict labour found in other colonies, thus also reducing unemployment; to eliminate religious discrimination and; to make the colony economically self-sufficient. It was intended that free settlers would be attracted on the basis of freedom in the political, economic, civil and religious spheres, as well as opportunities for wealth through farming and commerce. Hence the transportation of convicts from the United Kingdom was forbidden by the South Australia Act, despite many convicts being transported to penal settlements in New South Wales (between 1788 and 1842), Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania; 1802–1853), and Moreton Bay (Queensland; 1825–1842). (Later, convicts were also transported to Western Australia, between 1850 and 1868). \\"Poor Emigrants\\", while they were assisted by an Emigration Fund, were required to bring their families with them.South Australia Act, or Foundation Act, of 1834 (UK). Documenting a Democracy. Retrieved 11 May 2016. The Act further specified that the colony was also intended to be developed at no cost to the British government (such as the expenses incurred in transporting convicts). So that South Australia stood a better chance of being self-sufficient, a £20,000 surety had to be created and £35,000 worth of land was to be sold in the colony before any settlement occurred. These conditions were fulfilled before the end of 1835, possibly with Raikes Currie or his family bank, Curries & Co., acting as surety. The Act also included a promise of representative government when the population reached 50,000 people. A guarantee of the rights of \\"any Aboriginal Natives\\" and their descendants to lands they 'now actually occupied or enjoyed' was included in the 1836 Letters Patent enabling the South Australia Act included.Letters Patent establishing the Province of South Australia 19 February 1836 (UK). Documenting a Democracy. Retrieved 11 May 2016. The western and eastern boundaries of the colony were set at 132° and 141° East of Greenwich, and to the north at the Tropic of Capricorn, (23° 26′ South).South Australian Association, South Australia: Outline of the Plan of a Proposed Colony to be Founded on the South Coast of Australia, London, Ridgway, 1834, p.6 The western and eastern boundary points were chosen as they marked the extent of coastline first surveyed by Matthew Flinders in 1802 (Nicolas Baudin's priority being ignored).Henry Capper and William Light, South Australia: Extracts from the Official Dispatches of Colonel Light, ... letters of settlers ... [and] the proceedings of the South Australian Company, London, H. Capper, 1837, p.21. The South Australia Act 1834 imposed various financial obligations on the colonists that had to be met before the province could be created. In order to meet one of these obligations, pertaining to the sale of land, George Fife Angas created the South Australian Company, along with his banker, Raikes Currie. Both Angas and Currie contributed significantly to the sale of property, with the former contributing £40,000 and the latter (and the Currie family) contributing £9,000 (possibly as much as £50,000). ===Official appointments=== By 1835, negotiations had been completed for the founding of the new colony of South Australia. Colonel Charles James Napier was first offered the position as Governor, but turned it down because he was not allowed to take a body of troops, and recommended Colonel William Light for the position instead. However before receiving the recommendation, Lord Glenelg had already appointed Royal Navy Rear-Admiral John Hindmarsh as Governor in January 1836. Light was appointed Surveyor General of South Australia the following month, and various other officials were appointed to other positions: James Hurtle Fisher was Resident Commissioner and Registrar; Robert Gouger, Colonial Secretary; John Jeffcott, Judge; Charles Mann, Advocate-General; Osmond Gilles, Colonial Treasurer; George Strickland Kingston Deputy Surveyor, along with a team of assistant surveyors.

In early 1836, a nine ships accommodating 636 people in total set sail for South Australia.

After an eight-month voyage around the world, most of the ships took supplies and settlers to Kangaroo Island. They landed at Kingscote to await official decisions on the location and administration of the new colony. Light was given two months to locate the most advantageous location for the main colony. He was required to find a site with a harbour, arable land, fresh water, ready internal and external communications, building materials and drainage. Light rejected potential locations for the new main settlement, including Kangaroo Island, Port Lincoln and Encounter Bay. Light decided that the Adelaide plains were the best location for settlement. Most of the settlers were moved from Kangaroo Island to Holdfast Bay with Governor Hindmarsh arriving on 28 December 1836 to proclaim the province of South Australia. The Port River was sighted and deemed to be a suitable harbour, but there was no fresh water available nearby. The River Torrens was discovered to the south and Light and his team set about determining the city's precise location and layout. The survey was completed on 11 March 1837. Light's poorly paid and ill-equipped surveying team were expected to begin another massive task of surveying at least of rural land. Light, despite slowly succumbing to tuberculosis, managed to survey by June 1838. Most other colonies had been founded by Governors with near total authority. The South Australia Act 1834 gave control of the new colony to the Colonial Office (i.e. the Crown, represented by the Governor) as well as the Board of Colonisation Commissioners (with an appointed Resident Commissioner), which led to tensions between the two and caused problems later. The survey and sale of land, as well as migration arrangements and funding, were responsibilities of the Resident Commissioner, so that the British Government could not interfere with the business affairs or freedom of religion of the settlers. Relations between Hindmarsh and the Resident Commissioner quickly broke down. ===South Australia Act 1842: Crown takes control=== Land speculation, economic recession and inept administration combined to cause the Wakefield scheme to fail, and South Australia was spending ar more than its revenue. Financial bankruptcy of the colony in 1841 caused London to act. The immediate issue was heavy spending, and the failure of the colonization commissioners to use borrowing powers to secure loans. Gawler was replaced as governor by Captain George Grey. In London the secretary for the colonies assumed responsibility for South Australia. G. H. Pitt, \\"The Crisis of 1841: Its Causes and Consequences\\" South Australiana (1972) 11#2 pp 43-81. A British Parliamentary Enquiry recommended a more orthodox form of colonial administration to replace the Colonisation Commissioners. The South Australia Act 1842 instituted a different form of Government over the Province of South Australia. The Act was introduced as a result of recommendations by a British Parliamentary Enquiry into the failure of the colonial administration, which had brought the province of South Australia near bankruptcy by 1840, and gave the British Government full control of South Australia as a Crown Colony. It provided for the Governor and at least seven other officers to be appointed to form a legislative council for the governance of South Australia. Governor Grey sharply cut spending. The colony soon had full employment, and exports of primary products were increasing. Systematic emigration was resumed at the end of 1844. G. H. Pitt, \\"The Crisis of 1841: Its Causes and Consequences\\" South Australiana (1972) 11#2 pp 43-81. ==Expansion of the colony== ===Government=== Until 1851, the Governor ruled with the assistance of an appointed Executive Council of paid officials. Land development and settlement was the basis of the Wakefield vision. Land law and regulations governing it were fundamental to the foundation of the Province and allowed for land to be bought at a uniform price per acre (regardless of quality), with auctions for land desired by more than one buyer, and leases made available on unused land. Proceeds from land were to fund the Emigration Fund to assist poor settlers to come as tradesmen and labourers.South Australian Commission Land Sale Regulations 1835 (issued by the Commissioners in the UK) .

Most other colonies had been founded by Governors with near total authority, but in South Australia, power was initially divided between the Governor and the Resident Commissioner, so that government could not interfere with the business affairs or freedom of religion of the settlers. From 1843 to 1851, the colony was governed by a legislative council of seven appointed members. By 1851 the colony was experimenting with a partially elected council, with 16 of 24 members of the South Australian Legislative Council being elected that year and the remainder appointed.Legislative Council 1843-1856 .

The General Registry Office holds deeds and records of land transactions from 1837 until the implementation of Real Property Act 1858. This law implemented a system which became known as Torrens title, after Sir Robert Richard Torrens, who instigated the bill and ensured its passage through parliament. After this, all new land transactions were conducted under the new system, using a land title. The role of the GRO included property transactions (mortgages, conveyances, leases, land grants, indentures, wills, probate), as well as deeds for a number of other actions (such as deed poll name changes). The documents called \\"memorials\\" represent those original deeds registered and held by the GRO, whereas the certified copies held by the GRO were known as \\"deposits\\" or \\"enrolments\\". The General Registry Office and Old Systems land records are (as of July 2019) held at the Land Services Group at Netley, where there are alphabetical indices of records from 1842 to the present, for land that does not fall under the Torrens title. These records include those of early landowners and pioneer settlers. ===First agriculture: Sheep, wheat and wine=== In 1836 the South Australian Company imported pure merinos from the German region of Saxony, and cows and goats were also shipped over. Sheep and other livestock were brought in from Van Diemen's Land and later New South Wales. The wool industry was the basis of South Australia's economy for the first few years, with the first wool auction was held in Adelaide in 1840. Vast tracts of land were leased by \\"Squatters\\" until required for agriculture. Once the land was surveyed it was put up for sale and the Squatters had to buy their runs or move on. Most bought their land when it came up for sale, disadvantaging farmers who had a hard time finding good and unoccupied land. Farms took longer to establish than sheep runs and were expensive to set up. Despite this by 1860 wheat farms ranged from Encounter Bay in the south to Clare in the north. The settlers were mostly British, but some German settlers, mainly \\"Old Lutherans\\", also emigrated in the early years. The first large group of Germans arrived in 1838, with the financial assistance of the Emigration Fund. Most moved out of Adelaide and to the Barossa Valley and settlements in the Adelaide Hills such as Hahndorf, living in socially closed communities, by 1842, and did not participate in government until 15 years later. The punitive expedition to the Coorong after 25 survivors of the shipwreck Maria were massacred by Aborigines in 1840. In the Coorong Massacre in 1840, the brigantine Maria was shipwrecked near Cape Jaffa.Judy Hamman, “The Coorong Massacre: A Study In Early Race Relations In South Australia.” Flinders Journal of History & Politics. 1973, Vol. 3, p1-9 All 25 survivors were massacred by people of the Milmenrura (\\"big Murray tribe\\") when trying to find their way to Adelaide. A punitive expedition authorised by Governor George Gawler and carried out by William Pullen and Major O'Halloran executed two alleged perpetrators. The men killed in retribution were not put to trial and not proven to be those who carried out the massacre. The wine growing regions of McLaren Vale and the Barossa Valley were established in the 1840s. Port Pirie was founded in 1845. Copper was discovered near Kapunda in 1842. In 1845 even larger deposits of copper were discovered at Burra which brought wealth to the Adelaide shopkeepers who invested in the mine. John Ridley invented a reaping machine in 1843 which changed farming methods throughout South Australia and the nation at large. By 1843, of land was growing wheat (compared to in 1838). Toward the end of the century South Australia would become known as the \\"granary of Australia\\". Gold discoveries in Victoria in 1851 brought a severe labour shortage in Adelaide which was created by the exodus of workers leaving to seek their fortunes on the goldfields. However, this also created high demand for South Australian wheat. The situation improved when prospectors returned with their gold finds. During the 1850s over 5,400 hard working Germans settled in South Australia. Many started off the wine industry in the Barossa Valley and they opened the first Lutheran church in Hahndorf. South Australians were keen to establish trade links with Victoria and New South Wales, but overland transport was too slow. A £4,000 prize was offered in 1850 by the South Australian government for the first two people to navigate the River Murray in an iron steamboat as far as its junction with the Darling River. In 1853 William Randell of Mannum and Francis Cadell of Adelaide, unintentionally making the attempt at the same time, raced each other to Swan Hill with Cadell coming in first. Saint Mary Mackillop (1842–1909) co-founded an order of nuns in rural South Australia in 1866 and became the first Australian saint of the Catholic Church in 2010. South Australian suffragette Catherine Helen Spence (1825–1910). In 1895 women in South Australia were among the first in the world to attain the vote and were the first to be able to stand for parliament. ====Limited self-government==== By the mid 19th century, there was a strong desire for representative and responsible government in the colonies of Australia. In 1840, the Adelaide City Council was established as the first city council in the Australian colonies. The Australian Colonies Government Act [1850] was a landmark development which granted representative constitutions to New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania and the colonies enthusiastically set about writing constitutions which produced democratically progressive parliaments with the British monarch as the symbolic head of state.The Right to Vote in Australia.

In 1855, limited self-government was granted by London to New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania. An innovative secret ballot was introduced in Victoria, Tasmania and South Australia in 1856, in which the government supplied voting paper containing the names of candidates and voters could select in private. This system was adopted around the world, becoming known as the \\"Australian Ballot\\". 1855 also saw the granting of the right to vote to all male British subjects 21 years or over in South Australia. In 1877, it became the first part of the British Empire to legalise Trade Unions and in 1891, four United Labor Party candidates were elected to Parliament, becoming the first endorsed Labor members in Australia. Further copper discoveries were made in 1859 at Wallaroo and in 1861 at Moonta. South Australia was a haven for religious refugees leaving Europe over this period. German Lutherans established the influential Hermmannsberg Mission in Central Australia in 1870. David Unaipon who was to become a preacher and Australia's first Aboriginal author was born at Point McLeay Mission in South Australia in 1872. The son of Australia's first Aboriginal pastor, he is today honoured on the Australian $50 note. Saint Mary Mackillop co-founded the Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart in rural South Australia in 1866. Dedicated to the education of the children of the poor, it was the first religious order to be founded by an Australian. Mackillop established schools, orphanages and welfare institutions throughout the colonies.

During John McDouall Stuart's 1862 expedition to the north coast of Australia he discovered of grazing territory to the west of Lake Torrens and Lake Eyre. Stuart succeeded in traversing Central Australia from south to north. His expedition mapped out the route which was later followed by the Australian Overland Telegraph Line.Tim Flannery; The Explorers; Text Publishing 1998 South Australia was made responsible for the administration of the Northern Territory, which was previously part of New South Wales. In the 1890s Australia was affected by a severe economic depression. Financial institutions in Melbourne and banks in Sydney closed. The national fertility rate fell and immigration was reduced to a trickle. The value of South Australia's exports nearly halved. Drought and poor harvests from 1884 compounded the problems with some families leaving for Western Australia. Adelaide was not as badly hit as the larger gold-rush cities of Sydney and Melbourne, and silver and lead discoveries at Broken Hill provided some relief. ===Self-governing colony (1856)=== Old Parliament House in 1872 South Australia became a self-governing colony in October 1856 with the ratification of a new constitution by the British parliament via the Constitution Act 1856. A bicameral parliament was elected on 9 March 1857, by which time 109,917 people lived in the province. South Australia's 1856 constitution was among the most democratic in the world – more so than the other Australian colonies, the United Kingdom and most European countries at that time. It provided for: Adult male suffrage (including indigenous men); Secret ballot voting; one man, one vote; no property qualifications for Members of its House of Assembly and a relatively low property qualification for Members of its Legislative Council.Democracy and human rights in the 19th century.

The Constitutional Amendment Act 1894 was also the first legislation in the world permitting women also to stand for election to political office and, in 1897, Catherine Helen Spence became the first female political candidate for political office, unsuccessfully standing for election as a delegate to the Federal Convention on Australian Federation.Constitution (Female Suffrage) Act 1895 (SA) .

By the 1890s, several new factors were drawing the Australian colonies towards political union and South Australians voted by referendum to join the Commonwealth of Australia. ==Governance of Aboriginal people== Lake Hope Protectors of Aborigines had been appointed from as early as 1836 in South Australia (with Matthew Moorhouse as the first gazetted appointment as Chief Protector in 1939), with the Governor proclaiming that Aborigines were \\"to be considered as much under the safeguard of the law as the Colonists themselves, and equally entitled to the Privileges of British Subjects. Under the Aboriginal Orphans Ordinance 1844 the Protector was made legal guardian of \\"every half-caste and other unprotected Aboriginal child whose parents are dead or unknown\\". Schools and Aboriginal reserves were set up. Despite these attempts at protection, Moorhouse himself presided over the Rufus River massacre in 1841. The office of Protector was abolished in 1856; within four years, 35 of the 42 Aboriginal reserves had been leased to settlers. The protection of the Aboriginal people was mostly left to missionaries from 1856 to 1881 (after the office of Protector was abolished, the work being done by Sub-protectors reporting direct to the Commissioner of Crown Lands), when another Protector was appointed. In 1912, the Aborigines' Office (which had operated under a succession of different ministers) became the Aborigines' Department, initially a change in name only. In 1918, an Advisory Council of Aborigines was appointed under powers given by the Aborigines Act 1911, to take control of the existing missions (at Point McLeay, Point Pearce, Killalpaninna and Koonibba). The Aborigines Act Amendment Act 1939 abolished the office of Chief Protector of Aborigines and the Advisory Council, and created the Aborigines Protection Board, of which Charles Duguid was a founding member. ==Twentieth century== On 1 January 1901, following a proclamation by Queen Victoria, South Australia ceased to be a self-governing colony and became a state of the Commonwealth of Australia. In 1906, South Australia's first uranium mine was opened at Radium Hill.

It consists of a panel of eight drawings of Noongar activist Ken Colbung speaking to a group of three Indigenous Australian children.Alston, Dean (1997). \\"Alas, Poor Yagan\\". The West Australian, 6 September 1997. The cartoon's content offended many Australians, and resulted in a complaint of racism to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. The commission eventually ruled that the cartoon made inappropriate references to Noongar beliefs but did not breach the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. This ruling was subsequently upheld on appeal to the Federal Court of Australia. ==Background== Alas Poor Yagan was published shortly after the return of Yagan's head from the United Kingdom. Yagan was a Noongar warrior who resisted the European settlement of Western Australia. He was shot dead by a settler in 1833, and his head was removed and sent to the United Kingdom for display in a museum. In 1964, it was buried in an unmarked grave in a local cemetery. The Noongar community began efforts to locate and repatriate the head in 1990. Yagan's head was finally exhumed in September 1997, but organisation of the handover \\"was accompanied by a degree of sometimes undignified acrimony over who had the appropriate cultural claims, by descent, to bring the remains back\\".Federal Court of Australia (2004). Bropho v Human Rights & Equal Opportunity Commission [2004 FCAFC 16]. 6 February 2004 These conflicts within the Noongar community were publicly aired, and at one point even involved litigation in the Supreme Court of Western Australia.Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (2001). Corunna v West Australian Newspapers (2001) EOC 93-146. 12 April 2001. ==Publication== The West Australian provided coverage of the repatriation of Yagan's head, including the conflict within the Nyungar community. Alas Poor Yagan was published on 6 September 1997. It was critical of the fact that the return of Yagan's head had become a source of conflict between Noongars instead of fostering unity, and it lampooned the conduct of those involved in the conflict. It could also be interpreted as insulting aspects of Indigenous Australian culture, and casting aspersions on the motives and legitimacy of Indigenous Australians with mixed racial heritage. ==Complaint== On 24 September 1997, a complaint about the cartoon was lodged with the Race Discrimination Commissioner of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. The complaint was made by human rights lawyer Hannah McGlade on behalf of a group of people calling themselves \\"The Nyungar Circle of Elders\\", and comprising Albert Corunna, Richard Wilkes, Violet Newman, Mingli Wanjurri, Leisha Eatts, Robert Bropho and Ken Colbung. The complainants alleged that Alston and The West Australian had breached \\"s18c of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975\\". On 4 March 1998, the Race Discrimination Commissioner discontinued her inquiry into the case on the grounds that the cartoon was \\"an artistic work\\" that was published \\"reasonably and in good faith\\", and was therefore exempt from the s18c conditions under s18d of the Act. The Nyungar Circle of Elders rejected that finding, and asked for the case to be referred to the Commission for public inquiry. A public hearing was held on 29 April 1999, and the findings released on 12 April 2001. The Commission found that the cartoon was in breach of s18c of the Act; specifically, it found that the cartoon: * contained a demeaning portrayal of Yagan; * reinforced a negative stereotype regarding alcohol and Indigenous Australians; * contained derogatory references to the Wagyl, a religious figure; * treated death in a manner offensive to Indigenous Australians; * provided intimate details of the ancestry of individuals, in some cases \\"where the intercourse was not a matter of choice for the Aboriginal women concerned\\"; * implied a diminishing of the race by the resultant racial mix; and * reinforced a negative stereotype of Indigenous people taking advantage of government grants. The Commission also found, however, that the cartoon was exempt under s18d of the Act, because it was done reasonably and in good faith. The reasoning was based partly on the overall coverage of the issue by The West Australian, which \\"provided a balance report... and an opinion which... encouraged unity in, and support of, the Aboriginal community\\". In such a context, the decision by then editor Paul Murray to publish the cartoon was found to be reasonable. Robert Bropho then sought a judicial review of the Commission's finding, but his application was dismissed on 4 December 2002. Bropho then appealed against that decision in the Federal Court of Australia. On 6 February 2004, the Federal Court dismissed the appeal and ordered Bropho to pay all costs. ==Analysis== According to McGlade, a number of academic commentators have expressed concern about the ruling, in particular that the protections offered under s18c were being undermined by a broad interpretation of the s18d exemption. McGlade has argued that \\"It is extremely difficult to reconcile the serious finding of breach under section18C with the subsequent finding of reasonableness under section 18D.\\" and that \\"obviously the adverse findings made of the Commission could have been relied upon to defeat the respondent's claim to have acted reasonably and in good faith. It appears that the complainants were placed under an impossible burden of proving explicit motive and intent.... [P]roper remedies are being denied by the responsible bodies.\\" A similar point is made by Anna Chapman, who argues that \\"the result of the case was a reification of dominant racial values... in prioritising non-indigenous racial narratives over Indigenous perspectives.\\" ==References== Category:1997 in Australia Category:Australian art Category:Australian case law Category:Editorial cartoons Category:History of Western Australia Category:Indigenous Australian politics Category:Noongar Category:Anti-indigenous racism in Australia Category:Cartoon controversies ","title":"Alas Poor Yagan"},{"id":"3236062","text":"The Gibson EB-3 is an electric bass guitar model produced by the Gibson Guitar Corporation. == Origins and history == Introduced in 1961, the EB-3 (based on an earlier model, the EB-0) was one of the bass guitar equivalents of the popular Gibson SG. It was produced at Gibson's plant in Kalamazoo, MI. It featured a slim SG-style body, a short 30.5\\" scale, and two pickups (a large humbucking pickup in the neck position and a mini-humbucker pickup in the bridge position). The electronics consisted of a four-way rotary pickup selector switch (for Series 1 basses; neck pickup with midrange notch, bridge, bridge and neck with low end rolled off neck pickup, neck pickup with choke) and volume and tone knobs for each pickup. The standard finish was cherry red (like the SG guitar models), though EB-3s were also produced in other finishes such as Polaris White, Pelham Blue, Walnut, and Ebony. By the time production ceased in 1979, a total of 14,167 instruments had been built. The design of the EB-3 changed several times during the 1960s. In 1962, the black plastic cover on the neck pickup was replaced by a metal one. Around 1964-5, the nickel-plated hardware was replaced by chrome-plated. Around mid-1965, the wide control spacing from the early 1960s was reduced, giving all SG guitars and basses the same size and shape control cavity. Around 1966-7 the neck was replaced with a thinner one; the unadjustable bar bridge was replaced by a fully adjustable one with a nylon saddle for each string; the string guard was removed; a bridge guard was introduced and the knobs were replaced with the witch-hat design. In 1969 and 1970, the headstock was replaced with a slotted one (similar to those on most classical guitars), with tuning keys mounted at ninety degrees downwards behind the head. In 1972, the neck pickup was moved closer to the bridge, and maple with added volute instead of mahogany was used for the neck. In 1973 the 3-point bridge was used. In addition to the Gibson EB-3, a long-scale (34\\") model called the EB-3L was introduced in 1969\\"1969 EB-3 specs\\" - \\"EB-3L available with 34.5\\" scale\\" in: for players who preferred the longer scale of most Fender basses. The EB-3L long-scale variant was discontinued in 1972,\\"1969 EB-3 specs\\" - \\"EB-3L available with 34.5\\" scale\\" ... \\"available until 1972\\" in: and the EB-3 itself in 1979. From the late 1980s until 1998, Gibson cooperated with Epiphone in Japan to produce for the Japanese market an EB-3 under the brand Orville by Gibson, named after the company's founder Orville Gibson. Gibson currently produces a model called the SG Bass which is very similar to the EB-3, but with only a single tone control and no Varitone switch. Epiphone produces a more affordable EB-3 with a 34\\" scale (similar to the EB-3L), but the Varitone switch has been replaced by a simple pickup selector.This version, along with the Epiphone EB-0, was discontinued in early 2020, when the whole Epiphone lineup was reinvented. none ==Notable EB-3 players== * Trevor Bolder played an EB-3 with David Bowie's Spiders from Mars band in the early 1970s. * Jack Bruce switched from a Fender Bass VI to an EB-3 before the recording of Cream's Disraeli Gears (1967). * Glenn Cornick played an EB-3 for most of his last two years with Jethro Tull (1969–70). * Bob Daisley played an EB-3 on Ozzy Osbourne's Blizzard of Ozz (1980) and on many other albums. * Andy Fraser of Free also played an EB-3. * Rik Fox *Jermaine Jackson of the Jackson 5 * Jim Lea played an EB-3 in Slade during their most successful period in the early 1970s. * Pete Quaife of The Kinks sometimes used an EB-3 from May 1966 until his departure from the group in April 1969 along with a Rickenbacker 4001. His replacement, John Dalton also played the EB-3. * Mike Watt of Minutemen and fIREHOSE plays a heavily modified ’69 Gibson EB-3. * Chris White of The Zombies played an EB-3 as well. * Bill Wyman of The Rolling Stones favored an EB-3 together with an Ampeg Dan Armstrong Plexiglas bass for most of The Rolling Stones Pacific Tour 1973, and an EB-3 for the entire The Rolling Stones European Tour 1973. * Doug Yule played an EB-3 in The Velvet Underground. alt= ==References== EB-3 ","title":"Gibson EB-3"},{"id":"3236072","text":"The Cowles Center for Dance and the Performing Arts (formerly the Minnesota Shubert Performing Arts and Education Center) is a performing arts center and flagship for dance in downtown Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States. The Cowles Center was developed as an incubation project by Artspace Projects, Inc and includes the refurbished 500-seat Goodale Theater (formerly the Sam S. Shubert Theater); the Hennepin Center for the Arts, home to 20 leading dance and performing arts organizations; a state-of-the-art education studio housing a distance learning program; and an atrium connecting the buildings. The Cowles Center is a catalyst for the creation, presentation and education of dance in the Twin Cities. Both the Goodale Theater and the Hennepin Center for the Arts (formerly the Minneapolis Masonic Temple) are on the National Register of Historic Places. The distance learning program began teaching students in 2002. Using IP videoconferencing technologies, it brings artists into classrooms throughout Minnesota, nationally and internationally, creating two-way interactive, real-time teaching environments. ==Original Samuel S. Shubert Theater== The Shubert Theatrical Company, run by brothers Levi, Samuel, and Jacob, entered the New York theater scene in 1900 and had become the largest theater owning and producing organization in America by 1920. When Samuel Shubert died in a train wreck in 1905, his brothers memorialized him by naming a few of their new theaters after him. Two of these new theaters opened on the same day in 1910: Saint Paul’s Shubert Theater, which became the Fitzgerald Theater in 1994, and The Samuel S. Shubert Theater in Minneapolis, which reopened as The Cowles Center for Dance and the Performing Arts in September 2011, after a long and dramatic history. The Samuel S. Shubert Theater was designed by William Albert Swasey (1864–1940). For its time it was a mid-sized house, consisting of 1,500 seats with two shallow balconies. The front of the building had a Classical Revival façade featuring four pairs of bas-relief columns framing three arched windows at the second-story level. As with many of Swasey’s other buildings, the decorative elements of the façade were made of glazed terra cotta. The opening show at Minneapolis’ new Samuel S. Shubert Theatre was The White Sister starring Viola Allen. Ticket prices ranged from $2.50 to 50 cents. Alexander G. “Buzz” Bainbridge, a former press agent for Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show and general manager for a Chicago producer of touring shows, became the Shubert's manager in 1910, at the age of 25. The Shubert had been conceived as a venue for touring Broadway shows, but those tours stopped in the summer, leaving the theater empty, so, the Shuberts tasked Bainbridge with creating a resident acting ensemble. The Bainbridge Players became a popular year-round attraction. Several of its actors, such as Victory Jory, Gladys George, and Johnny Dilson, went on to successful film careers. In 1915, The Shubert began to play movies, accompanied by a 40-piece pit orchestra. In 1918 the flu epidemic closed all Minneapolis theaters. The Shubert remodeled; new lights were installed, the orchestra pit was expanded, and the theater was repainted. Throughout the 1920s the prevalence and popularity of films began to push out live theater. While the Shubert held on until 1933, it could not withstand the changing of the tides. Bainbridge disbanded his company, and became mayor of Minneapolis from 1933 to 1935.The Many Lives of the Schubert Theater ==The Alvin== The Shubert came back to life as “The Alvin” in 1935, named after its new owner William Alvin Steffes. Steffes added an Art Deco marquee and split the stage time between movies and touring Broadway shows until December 1940, when the theater went under for two months before reincarnating as a burlesque theater. Despite a fire on July 6, 1941, which necessitated a five-month-long renovation, The Alvin theater kept its doors open as a burlesque theater until 1953. Some of the best known strip-tease artists of the day including Tempest Storm, Candy Barr, and Gypsy Rose Lee performed there. A typical burlesque show offered not only titillation, but entertainment by jugglers, comedians, and variety acts. One of the most noteworthy of these performers was Dudley Riggs, a comedian juggler who went on to found Brave New Workshop, now housed only a few blocks from The Cowles Center. In November 1953, the Alvin underwent yet another change when the Reverend Russell H. Olson turned the building into the Minneapolis Evangelistic Auditorium. The church closed only three years later. ==The Academy== The Shubert came back in 1957 when Ted Mann bought it, converted it into a movie theater, and renamed it The Academy. On July 12, 1957, The Academy hosted the Minneapolis premiere of Minnesota native Michael Todd's Around the World in Eighty Days. Todd, who used to be a candy vendor in the old Shubert Theater, attended the opening with his wife, Elizabeth Taylor. The Academy began to struggle as suburban multiplexes replaced single-screen houses, and 1983 brought yet another closing of the theater's doors. ==Closed doors and new projects== In 1987, 25% of reported crimes in downtown Minneapolis were committed on Block E, where the Shubert was located. In an effort to combat the increasing crime, the Minneapolis City Council approved guidelines for a redevelopment project. However, the project brought The Shubert under threat of the wrecking ball. Block E was razed in 1988 and 1989 except for the Shubert. In 1990, the Heritage Preservation Commission convinced city officials not to demolish the Shubert unless it proved prohibitively expensive to develop Block E with the theater in place. Save Our Shubert wrote letters to editors and held candlelight vigils outside the theater. The Shubert was added to the National Register of Historic places in 1996, leaving Brookfield Development to find a way to incorporate the Shubert into their Block E proposal. Artspace Vice President Tom Nordyke had the idea to move the Shubert out of the way, solving the issue in a way that benefited preservationists, developers, and the arts community. Bakke Kopp Ballou and McFarlin Inc of Minneapolis concluded that the option of moving a 6-million- pound building a few blocks was, in fact, feasible. It took twelve days to move the theater from Block E to its new Hennepin Avenue location in February 1999. At 5.8 million pounds, it was the heaviest building ever moved on rubber tires, and holds a Guinness World Record for this accomplishment. The Shubert was too large to be moved on city streets, but the only things between it and its new home were parking lots. Renovation of the building at its new location created The Cowles Center for the Performing Arts. ==Goodale Theater== Watching Groundbreaker Battle 2008 at Minnesota Shubert's month-long Hip-Hop Dance: From the Street to the State The refurbished Goodale Theater with 505 seats (216 orchestra level, 289 Grand Tier level) offer guests intimate, unobstructed views of the entire stage with no seat further than 65 feet from center stage. Each row of seats arcs semi-circularly to face center stage. Ornate columns of cherrywood and historic architectural details frame the proscenium arch. Floors throughout the backstage area are covered with a special linoleum that allows ballet performers to walk from dressing rooms to the stage without removing their toe shoes. The spacious backstage spaces and dressing rooms allow maximum flexible space to support a wide variety of companies and performance needs. The orchestra pit accommodates up to 42 musicians and adds the dimension of live orchestral music. The orchestra pit can also be adjusted to add two additional rows of seating in the house. The stage is large enough to provide choreographers with ample space in the wings to perform large-scale productions. The stage also includes a full-size stage house with 52 riggings that can support extensive and elaborate set designs. ==U.S. Bank Atrium== The main entrance to The Cowles Center houses the box office and information desk, concession space, donor wall, and entrances to the Goodale Theater and The Hennepin Center for the Arts. A Labanotation wall art piece inspired by Rites of Spring hangs above the concession area. Developed by dance artist and theorist Rudolf Laban (1878–1958), Labanotation is a way of writing down dance which is analogous to the way music notation is a way of writing down music. Labanotation uses symbols to represent points on a dancer's body, the direction of the dancer's movements, the tempo, and the dynamics. ==Target Education Studio== The studio was designed specifically for dance with a sprung maple floor, studio lighting and a wall of mirrors. It houses the center's long distance learning program. Using video conferencing technology, the center brings artists into classrooms to create two-way, interactive, real-time teaching environments. Thanks to generous funding, the center is also able to provide free sessions to Minnesota schools. ==Inaugural season== The Cowles Center inaugural season spanned the fall of 2011 and the spring of 2012 and brought a variety of Minnesota dance companies to the same venue. Dance companies which performed in the 2011–12 season included: * Ragamala Dance * Minnesota Dance Theatre * Beyond Ballroom Dance Company * Black Label Movement * Zorongo Flamenco * Native Pride Dancers * James Sewell Ballet * Matthew Janczewski's Arena Dance * Stuart Pimsler Dance and Theater * Katha Dance Theater * Shapiro and Smith Dance Company * Zenon Dance Company * Breaking Boundaries Dance Company * Tu Dance The inaugural season also included Cantus, and a performance by New York-based dancers Kegwin + Company. ==References== ==External links== * The Cowles Center * Artspace USA Category:Colonial Revival architecture in Minnesota Category:Dance in Minnesota Category:National Register of Historic Places in Minneapolis Category:Performing arts education in the United States Category:Theatres completed in 1910 Category:Theatres on the National Register of Historic Places in Minnesota ","title":"Cowles Center for Dance and the Performing Arts"},{"id":"3236076","text":"Stewart Airport may refer to: * Stewart International Airport, near Newburgh, New York, United States (IATA/FAA: SWF) * Stewart Aerodrome, near Stewart, British Columbia, Canada (IATA: ZST) * Everett-Stewart Regional Airport, near Union City, Tennessee, United States (IATA/FAA: UCY) ","title":"Stewart Airport"},{"id":"3236079","text":"Frances Helen Allison (November 20, 1907June 13, 1989) was an American television and radio comedienne, personality, and singer. She is best known for her starring role on the weekday NBC-TV puppet show Kukla, Fran and Ollie, which ran from 1947 to 1957, occasionally returning to the air until the mid-1980s. The trio also hosted The CBS Children's Film Festival, introducing international children's films, from 1967 to 1977. ==Biography== ===Early years=== Frances Helen Allison was born to Jesse Louis (1871–1941) Allison and Anna M \\"Nan\\" (née Halpin; 1876–1957) Allison in La Porte City, Iowa, where her father worked as a clerk in a grocery store until his stroke in 1913. They then moved in with her paternal grandparents, David Allison, a Civil War veteran, and Susan (née Booth) Allison. Their house still stands on Sycamore Street in LaPorte City, IA. She was a 1927 graduate of Coe College, where she was a member of Alpha Gamma Delta. She was a fourth-grade teacher for four years in Schleswig and Pocahontas, Iowa, before beginning her broadcasting career at WMT in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. (Another source describes WMT as \\"Waterloo radio station WMT.\\") In 1934, Allison was among \\"14 sectional winners in the Hollywood Hotel radio contest.\\" ===Radio=== Allison as Aunt Fanny She moved to Chicago, Illinois in 1937, where she was hired as a staff singer and personality on NBC Radio. A July 26, 1937, newspaper item reported, \\"Fran Allison, singer of WMT, Waterloo, Ia., makes her network debut in the WJZ-NBC club matinee at 3.\\" Beginning in 1937, she was a regular performer on The Breakfast Club, a popular Chicago (and NBC) radio show, and was a fixture for 25 years as \\"Aunt Fanny\\", a gossipy small-town spinster. Her Aunt Fanny character also appeared on the ABC-TV series, Ozark Jubilee, during the late 1950s. While in Chicago, she was also heard on Those Websters. ===Kukla, Fran and Ollie=== In 1947, the director of WBKB-TV in Chicago asked Burr Tillstrom if he could put together a puppet show for children, and he asked Allison, whom he had met during a World War II war bond tour, to join the show. She was the only human to appear on the live series, filling the role of big sister and cheery voice of reason as the puppets, known as the Kuklapolitan Players, engaged each other. ===Other television work=== Her television career continued after the initial run of Kukla, Fran and Ollie: in the late 1950s, she hosted The Fran Allison Show, a panel discussion TV program in Chicago; and appeared in television musical specials including Many Moons (1954), Pinocchio with Mickey Rooney (1957), Damn Yankees (1967) and Miss Pickerell (1972). She had her own program, The Fran Allison Show on WGN-TV (1958-1960). In the 1980s, she hosted Prime Time, a show for senior citizens, on KHJ-TV in Los Angeles. ===Recordings=== Allison made records for the RCA Victor label. She had two minor pop hits. In 1950 her recording of \\"Peter Cottontail\\" charted at #26 around Easter of 1950. The next year her recording of \\"Too Young\\" achieved position #20. In both recordings she is backed by Jack Fascinato, who was the orchestra leader of Kukla, Fran and Ollie. ===Recognition=== In 1950, Allison was nominated for an Emmy Award as Most Outstanding Kinescoped Personality. In 1959, she won two Chicago Emmy awards. In 2002, she was a Silver Circle honoree of the Chicago/Midwest Chapter of the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences. In 1967, Iowa Wesleyan University awarded her an honorary doctorate of letters. ===Personal life=== Allison was married to music publisher Archie Levington. In her free time, she devoted her efforts to promoting mental health. One reporter wrote, \\"For mental health, she will travel anywhere, anytime.\\" ===Death=== In later life, Allison lived in Van Nuys, California. She died June 13, 1989, aged 81,DeLong, Thomas A.

It turned out that the car was owned by Eli Waterfield and driven by his friend, Geoffrey Lynn, but police were unable to make any arrests without further evidence. One evening, while Lynn sat in the car at the local market, two police officers approached him to ask to search it. Lynn said he would leave. One of the officers said he would stop him if he tried. Waterfield arrived, told the police that they had no right to seize his car and told Lynn to drive away. The officers blocked the way, but Waterfield told Lynn to drive through the officers. Lynn drove forward, forcing the officer to jump out of the way.

Original settler John Small was attracted to the abundance of Australian Redcedar. The town of Brushgrove was once a major trading hub for timber, sugar and other agriculture goods due to its location on the Clarence River.

The censorship agency was established in 1922 under the name \\"Main Administration for Literary and Publishing Affairs at the RSFSR Narkompros\\", abbreviated as Glavlit (Главлит). The latter term was in semiofficial use until the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Since the word \\"Glavlit\\" hints at \\"literature\\", the organization is often confused with Goskomizdat, which performed another type of censorship: it controlled the political content in fiction, poetry, etc. ==Chronology of names== *1922: Main Administration for Literary and Publishing Affairs under the People's Commissariat of Education of the RSFSR (Главное управление по делам литературы и издательств при Наркомате просвещения РСФСР): *1946: Administration for the Protection of Military and State Secrets in the Press under the USSR Council of Ministers.

(Главное управление по охране государственных тайн в печати при СМ СССР:) ==Functions== The function of Glavlit was to prevent publications of information that could compromise state secrets in books, newspapers and other printed matter, as well as in radio and TV broadcasting. There existed a special list of kinds of information forbidden for publication in sources open for general public. Initially there were three major categories of secret information: military, economical and \\"other\\". In later lists these were detailed further, e.g., \\"finance\\", \\"politics\\", \\"science and engineering\\", etc. were added. The first version of the list was decreed on October 13, 1921, before the creation of Glavlit, when censorship was a duty of a department of Vecheka. This list was updated several times. There were the following categories of secrecy: \\"top secret\\", \\"secret\\", and \\"not for disclosure\\". In addition, for the purposes of the law the secrets were classified into \\"state secrets\\" (secrets related to the overall functioning of the state), \\"military secrets\\", and \\"official secrets\\" (secrets related to immediate functioning of an office or enterprise). Glavlit performed its functions via regional offices. In the late Soviet Union, at institutions and enterprises the immediate censorship was performed by the so-called First Departments controlled by KGB. In fact, tight cooperation of Soviet secret services and Glavlit was unbroken from the very beginning. ==Staff== Pavel Lebedev-Polianskii was director of Glavlit from its establishment until 1930. == Related organizations== *Goskomizdat *First Department (also known as \\"secret department\\") *USSR State Technical Commission - Commission for Counteracting Foreign Engineering Intelligences *Military censorship was handled by the military counterintelligence of Soviet Army. == References == * - Soviet Union ==See also== *Censorship in the Soviet Union *Eastern Bloc information dissemination Category:Government of the Soviet Union Category:Censorship in the Soviet Union Category:1922 establishments in the Soviet Union Category:1991 disestablishments in the Soviet Union ","title":"General Directorate for the Protection of State Secrets in the Press"},{"id":"3236104","text":"Irby is a surname.

There is disagreement about whether Berg's teachings, as relayed through the Kabbalah Centre, have sufficient grounds and/or genuine authority according to halakha (Jewish law), as they include some dogmas and translations differing markedly from those of more-traditional Kabbalists. Some Jewish scholars emphatically reject such teachings, deeming them as foreign to both the Kabbalah in particular and to Judaism in general. In poor health following a stroke in 2004, Berg died on September 16, 2013. ==Biography== Berg was born as Shraga Feivel Gruberger in 1929 in Brooklyn, to an Orthodox Jewish family.Udovich, Mim. \\"Kabbalah Chronicles: Inside Hollywood's hottest cult\\", Radar Online, June 15, 2005. (Copy at ) His father, Max Gruberger, immigrated from Nadvorna, Galicia (now in Ukraine), and worked as a clothes presser in Williamsburg. In his youth, Berg underwent Talmudic education at Lakewood Yeshiva under Aharon Kotler.28 Questions and Answers About Kabbalah - Kabbalah Learning Centre 1992 He later returned to Williamsburg, where in 1951 at age 22 he received ordination from Yeshiva Torah Vodaas. Berg went into the business world and worked as an insurance agent for New York Life. He also became involved in real estate, and by 1962 it is claimed he was a millionaire. It is likely that he began to be called Philip during this time, as it is usual practice among jews with Yiddish names to use an English equivalent to be more comfortable in a secular environment. Bergs first wife, Rivkah Brandwein, had an uncle named Yehuda Brandwein, whom Berg first met on a trip to Israel in 1962. Brandwein, a Hasidic rabbi from the Stretiner Hasidic dynasty and a close student in the Kabbalistic circle around Yehuda Ashlag, would become Berg's Kabbalistic mentor. Brandwein was the head of the Religious Department of the Israeli national workers union, Histadrut, and established Yeshivat Kol Yehuda (named after Ashlag) as a continuation of his mentor's yeshiva/publishing house \\"Beit Ulpana Itur Rabbanim\\". The uniqueness of Kol Yehuda was that students focused on kabbalistic study. The students would receive a salary to cover their living expenses so they could devote themselves to full-time learning. However, Brandwein faced difficulty in finding funds for the yeshiva and publishing. Berg had become Brandwein's book distributor and fund raiser in the United States, and it is likely he was encouraged by Brandwein to establish the \\"National Institute for the Research in Kabbalah\\" in New York in 1965 to aid the yeshiva. Berg was studying with another of Ashlag's American students, Levi I. Krakovsky, of Brooklyn. Krakovsky was interested in publishing his books through the National Institute, but Brandwein did not agree. In Brandwein's letters to Berg, he also clarified that he did not encourage seeking or accepting funds from non-Jews for the yeshiva, as this was forbidden according to halakha. Eventually, Brandwein allowed Berg to teach one student Kabbalah, and in 1966 Berg received an additional rabbinic ordination from Brandwein which certified his knowledge of Kabbalah, conferring him to the highest rabbinical rank. After Brandwein's death in 1969, Berg returned to the United States and began working again with his former secretary (and future wife) Karen, on the condition that she let him teach her Kabbalah, a discipline he claimed was reserved exclusively for men. In 1971, Philip and Karen married and traveled to Israel. It was there that they changed their surname from Gruberger to Berg, as it was a common practice to shorten a European Jewish surname upon moving to Israel. In 1973, the Bergs returned to Queens, New York, where they established their full-time headquarters during the 1980s. Philip Berg's grave in the 177x177px Berg, who had been ill since suffering a stroke in 2004, died on September 16, 2013. He was generally reported to be 86 (although the Los Angeles Times reported that according to public records he was 84). He is survived by his wife Karen and two sons, Yehuda and Michael, who have led the Kabbalah Centre since his stroke. He also had eight children from his first marriage. ==The Research Centre of Kabbalah== In July 1965, Berg was initially involved in the founding of a publishing house called \\"The National Institute for the Research in Kabbalah\\"The Kabbalah Centre and Contemporary Spirituality Jody Myers along with Aslag's American student Levi Krakovsky, who died the following year. This Institute was most likely a fundraising branch of Brandwein’s Yeshiva Kol Yehuda, as books published by the Institute have Brandwein named as the senior figure, while Berg was listed as its president. Old City of Jerusalem240x240px Krakovsky was an emissary of Ashlag’s yeshiva \\"Itur Rabbanim\\",Krakovsky, If eventually - why not now? Kabbalah Foundation (1936). and had translated some of Ashlag’s writings into English to support the yeshiva. He also wrote his own English introductory books to Kabbalah, and in the 1930s established his own yeshiva in the United States for the purpose of teaching Kabbalah in English. Krakovsky’s writings were also published by the new Institute. In 1970, Berg legally changed the name of the National Institute to \\"The Research Centre of Kabbalah\\", establishing it as an independent Centre and publishing books of his own. His writings ranged from a basic introduction and explanation of Lurianic and Ashlagian Kabbalah to astrology and reincarnation. In 1971, Berg moved to Israel where he strengthened the Centre, gave lectures and disseminated his books. In 1980, he established a yeshiva, \\"Or Hozer le’Limud ha-Nigleh ve ha-Nistar\\" (Returning Light for the Study of the Revealed and the Concealed) in Tel Aviv, which circulated various kabbalistic works. On his return to the United States in 1984 with a number of Israeli students called the \\"Hevre\\" (friends), Berg expanded the Centre to more locations. The aim of the now independent Research Centre was to resolve a widespread spiritual crisis affecting Jews, where many found traditional Judaism dry and unfulfilling. Large numbers of young Jews were seeking eastern spiritual practices, involving themselves in dangerous cults or resorting to atheism. Berg, who believed Judaism was being taught dogmatically, was determined to show inquisitive soul searching Jews that the answers could be found in Kabbalah. === Controversy === There is some disagreement over who succeeded Brandwein as dean of the 80-year-old Yeshiva Kol Yehuda in Jerusalem. Berg has claimed to have replaced Brandwein, his ex- uncle-in-law by his first wife, in that role; that claim is disputed by Brandwein's son Avraham, who is the current dean. The Los Angeles Task Force on Cults and Missionaries claimed he was not affiliated with the yeshiva,Ellin, Abby; Sacks, Adam J. \\"The Kabbalah Centre Wants your Heart - and your Money: The String that Binds\\" in The Village Voice, August 11, 2004. although a letter sent to him by Brandwein in July 1968 indicated he was President of the yeshiva. In 2010, the Internal Revenue Service launched an investigation, reportedly investigating whether funds were directed to the personal enrichment of the Berg family, and subpoenaed financial records of the organization and two affiliated charities connected to Madonna. The Centre called the allegations \\"merit-less\\", and said it \\"intends to defend the case vigorously\\". ==Publications of Phillip S. Berg and The Research Centre of Kabbalah== *Philip S.

As of 2010, flash steam plants are the most common type of geothermal power generation plants in operation today, which use water at temperatures greater than that is pumped under high pressure to the generation equipment at the surface. With binary cycle geothermal power plants, pumps are used to pump hot water from a geothermal well, through a heat exchanger, and the cooled water is returned to the underground reservoir. A second \\"working\\" or \\"binary\\" fluid with a low boiling point, typically a butane or pentane hydrocarbon, is pumped at fairly high pressure () through the heat exchanger, where it is vaporized and then directed through a turbine. The vapor exiting the turbine is then condensed by cold air radiators or cold water and cycled back through the heat exchanger. A binary vapor cycle is defined in thermodynamics as a power cycle that is a combination of two cycles, one in a high temperature region and the other in a lower temperature region. ==Introduction to binary cycles== The use of mercury-water cycles in the United States can be dated back to the late 1920s. A small mercury-water plant which produced about 40 megawatts (MW) was in use in New Hampshire in the 1950s, with a higher thermal efficiency than most of the power plants in use during the 1950s. Unfortunately, binary vapor cycles have a high initial cost and so they are not as economically attractive.[Çengel, Yunus A., and Michael A. Boles. \\"Chapter 10: Vapor and Combined Power Cycles\\". Thermodynamics: An Engineering Approach. 7th ed. Boston: McGraw-Hill, 2002. 557-89. Print.], additional text. Water is the optimal working fluid to use in vapor cycles because it is the closest to an ideal working fluid that is currently available. The binary cycle is a process designed to overcome the imperfections of water as a working fluid. The cycle uses two fluids in an attempt to approach an ideal working fluid. ==Characteristics of optimal working fluids== selecting the optimal working fluid has pivotal importance, since they make a significant impact on the performance of binary cycles. #A high critical temperature and maximum pressure #Low triple-point temperature #A condenser pressure that is not too low (a substance with a saturation pressure at the ambient temperature is too low) #A high enthalpy of vaporization (hfg) #A saturation dome that resembles an inverted U #High thermal conductivity (good heat transfer characteristics) #Other properties: nontoxic, inert, inexpensive, and readily available ==Systems== ===Rankine vapor cycle=== The Rankine cycle is the ideal form of a vapor power cycle. The ideal conditions can be reached by superheating the steam in the boiler and condensing it completely in the condenser. The ideal Rankine cycle does not involve any internal irreversibilities and consists of four processes; isentropic compression in a pump, constant pressure heat addition in a boiler, isentropic expansion in a turbine, and constant pressure heat rejection in a condenser. ===Dual pressure=== This process is designed to reduce the thermodynamic losses incurred in the brine heat exchangers of the basic cycle. The losses occur through the process of transferring heat across a large temperature difference between the high temperature brine and the lower temperature of the working fluid. Losses are reduced by maintaining a closer match between the brine cooling curve and the working fluid heating curve. ===Dual fluid=== “Power is extracted from a stream of hot fluid, such as geothermal water, by passing the stream in heat exchange relationship with a working fluid to vaporize the latter, expanding the vapor through a turbine, and condensing the vapor in a conventional Rankine cycle. Additional power is obtained in a second Rankine cycle by employing a portion of the hot fluid after heat exchange with the working fluid to vaporize a second working fluid having a lower boiling point and higher vapor density than the first fluid.” ===Power plants=== There are numerous binary cycle power stations in commercial production: *Olkaria III, Kenya *Mammoth Lakes, California, United States *Steamboat Springs (Nevada), United States *Te Huka Power Station, New Zealand Binary cycle power plants have a thermal efficiency of 10-13%. ==See also== *Geothermal electricity *Working fluid ==References== ==External links== *Development of Downhole Pump for Binary Cycle Power Generation using Geothermal Water Category:Geothermal energy ","title":"Binary cycle"},{"id":"3236162","text":"Werribee Park is the estate of a historical building in Werribee, Victoria, Australia. It includes Werribee Park Mansion, the Victoria State Rose Garden, formal gardens, the Werribee Park National Equestrian Centre, the Werribee Open Range Zoo, a contemporary sculpture walk and a natural riverine which is being grown with the plants of the Kurung Jang Balluk clan who lived on Werribee River. There is also the Mansion Hotel and Conference Centre. The Park was purchased by the Victoria State Government in 1973. It was opened as a tourist attraction in 1977. It is run by Parks Victoria. The mansion and associated built facilities and grounds were listed on the Victorian Heritage Register on 1 April 1987. ==Mansion== Werribee Park Mansion was built between 1874 and 1877 in the Italianate-style by the pioneering pastoralists Thomas Chirnside (1815-1887) and his brother Andrew Chirnside (1818-1890), from Scotland, founders of the \\"Chirnside Pastoral Empire\\".Townson, John, John Bell Chirnside (1833-1902): His Life, Family and Descendants, 2009 Further reading see: Ronald, Heather B., Wool Past the Winning Post: A History of the Chirnside Family, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 1978 Its residential and working buildings supported a large farm workforce. The rooms open to the public include the billiard room, the main bedrooms, the reception rooms and part of the kitchen. Aerial Panorama of Werribee Park and its surrounds Werribee Park Mansion from above In 1887, after Thomas Chirnside committed suicide, his brother Andrew Spencer Chirnside took over the running of the Werribee and all the holdings along with his sons. When Andrew Chirnside died in 1890 of heart disease, his jewellery and other personal items were left to his wife, Mary Chirnside (née Begbie), for the term of her life and then to his sons, George Thomas Chirnside and John Percy Chirnside. Andrew Chirnside also bequeathed to his wife a legacy of £10,000, and an annuity of £5000 during her life to be paid out to her every six months. Lastly, Andrew Chirnside devised to his sons his interest in the Werribee Park and Point Cook Estates and all the other property of the partnership firm of Andrew Chirnside & Sons. One son, George Chirnside, inherited Werribee Park Mansion and surrounding lands while the younger brother, John Percy, inherited the rocky stone land above the railway line. Not surprisingly, this led to ill feelings, and when Percy purchased land and had Hamilton build \\"The Manor\\" in 1895–1896, George took out a court order to prevent Percy from using the word \\"Werribee\\" when naming his new mansion. From 1923 to 1973, Werribee Park Mansion was a Catholic seminary, Corpus Christi College. The wings, which are now the Mansion Hotel were added during that period. In 1996 episodes set in England for the television series The Genie From Down Under were shot at the mansion. Rooms in the house were used for American-based film The Pirate Movie, starring Kristy McNichol and Christopher Atkins. The mansion was also used in the 1976 film The Devil's Playground. In December 2007, the Werribee Park Mansion hosted two Elton John concerts as part of his Rocket Man Solo Tour. Every year the Werribee Mansion Grounds are used to host the Werribee Christmas Carols event, the harvest festival, the polo championships and since 2013 on New Year’s Day, the Let Them Eat Cake music festival.residentadvisor.net ==Heritage Orchard== Werribee Park Heritage Orchard is an antique orchard dating from the 1870s. It was renowned for its peaches, grapes, apples, quinces, pears, a variety of plums and several other fruits, as well as walnuts and olives. Over the past few decades the orchard was forgotten and - through neglect - fell into ruin. Recently this historic treasure was rediscovered. Some of the old heritage fruit varieties survive - mainly quince, pear and apple. In partnership with Parks Victoria a community group was formed in 2010 to look after the orchard. The aims of Werribee Park Heritage Orchard are: # To provide support for and to foster public awareness of the orchard. # To assist with the preservation and enhancement of the orchard and with special projects selected by the group in consultation with Parks Victoria and other major stakeholders. # To involve people with an interest in the orchard. ==National Equestrian Centre== The Werribee Park National Equestrian Centre is an international standard sporting facility for equestrian events, including Equitana and the World Polo Championships. It was officially opened in 1984 as the designated State Centre for equestrian activity. Before 1992, it was operated by the Werribee Park Corporation and was used by the Victorian Polo Association and the Victorian branch of Equestrian Australia. In 1992, the facility was leased for 21 years to the Werribee Park National Equestrian Centre Inc. This association comprises representatives of these two bodies.

In 1986, it officially became one of the 117 (now 101) U.S. historically black colleges and universities. The institution also changed its name in 1986 to the University of the Virgin Islands to reflect the growth and diversification of its academic curriculum, research programs, and regional community services. On August 18, 2010, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit decided that the university's regulations prohibiting signs and conduct that could cause emotional distress were unconstitutional. ==Campuses== The university has two campuses and two extension facilities. The campus opened in 1963 on St. Thomas, at the time named College of the Virgin Islands.1963, College of the Virgin Islands: Acreage: The Albert A. Sheen campus is on St. Croix. The extensions include an academic center and an environmental research facility, both on St. John. The St. Croix campus is located on Estate Golden Grove in mid-island. The latter campus is three miles (5 km) from Charlotte Amalie, the capital of the territory. The St. Thomas campus is situated on two hills and it has its own beach (John Brewer's Bay beach) which can be directly accessed off the main road which cuts through the campus. The majority of the buildings on the St. Thomas campus are made of volcanic rock and cement. This makes the campus not only aesthetically pleasing but it also improves the structural integrity of the structures as the U.S. Virgin Islands are known for experiencing very active hurricane seasons. ===Athletic facilities=== Sports and Fitness Center The campus on St. Thomas boasts a Sports and Fitness Center with an adjacent weightlifting and aerobic exercise gym, as well as a golf course, tennis courts, outdoor basketball and volleyball courts, and baseball and soccer fields. The Sports and Fitness Center can seat up to 3,500 people and annually hosts the Paradise Jam Tournament for mainland NCAA basketball teams. On St. Croix, there is an outdoor sports facility equipped with basketball, volleyball, and tennis courts. Also, there is a small exercise gym inside the Student Activities center. St. Croix has large fields in front, and they are usually acceptable for athletic use, but they tend to flood during heavy rain. ===Housing=== In 2012 the university added a 37,000 square foot residential hall. The university has six different sets of dorms on the St. Thomas campus which include: Eastern Dorms, Western Dorms, Northern Dorms, Southern Dorms, and Middle Dorms. The Eastern and Western Dorms are both unisex dorms whereas the South and Middle are all-female dorms. The Northern Dorms are all male dorms.Dorms: Albert A. Sheen Campus on St. Croix has two residence halls, which together are known as the Delta M. Jackson Dorsch Complex. Its doors opened to students in 1999. Housing consists of 45 rooms with two beds per room, allowing accommodation for 90 students. The halls are sectioned into blocks: Knight's Block, Pirate's Block, Spartan's Block, and Titan's Block. Each block is designated by gender. ===St. John Academic Center=== St. John, the northernmost island of the US Virgin Islands currently has no college campus on the island. Residents of St. John wishing to attend the UVI are required to travel by ferry to the island of St. Thomas to attend classes. The journey can take a few minutes each way. UVI President, David Hall, made it a priority to provide easier access to students living in St. John. After speaking with residents of St. John, Dr. Hall (President) discovered many obstacles hindering student education, including lack of access to a library and study spaces. Through the HBCU Library Alliance, funds were raised for the construction of a learning center in St. John. UVI chief information officer, Tina Koopmans, and library and IT staff developed a plan and located the resource center in an old gymnasium in St. John's MarketPlace. The St. John Academic Center (STJAC) contains four classrooms, a library, and a computer lab. Additionally, students can attend class via video conferencing technology so that they do not need to travel off the island as frequently. There are also individual and group study spaces available. According to Koopmans UVI has \\"seen an increase in our St. John student population from 37 to 47, and we are only at the beginning of the process.\\" In addition to being used by students, the STJAC provides the entire St. John community with access to the Small Business Development Center, access to the general library and Wi-Fi networks, and conference rooms for meetings. Currently, the STJAC is undergoing a relocation from the MarketPlace to the Department of Planning and Natural Resources in Cruz Bay. ===Technology and research facilities=== The legislature of the Virgin Islands chartered the University of the Virgin Islands Research and Technology Park to help expand the technology segment of the islands' economy, encourage more businesses to operate on the islands, and foster technology research and activities at the university. The university is filled with knowledgeable staff to help guide and support students in reaching their goals. The United States Department of Agriculture operates a large agricultural experiment station on the St. Croix campus working on agroforestry, aquaponics, biotechnology, forage agronomy, and tilapia farming. The University also own and run the Etelman Observatory. ==Academics== Entrance sign The university has five academic divisions: Business, Education, Humanities and Social Sciences, Nursing, and Science and Mathematics. UVI offers various graduate degree and undergraduate degree programs. The graduate programs consist of a Specialist Degree in Education Specialist in School Psychology and the following Master's degrees: Master of Arts in Education, Master of Arts in Mathematics for Secondary Teachers, Master of Business Administration, Master of Marine and Environmental Science, Master of Psychology and Master of Public Administration. The Undergraduate Degree Programs are divided into several categories: Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, Associate of Arts, Associate of Science, and Associate of Applied Science. Its liberal arts curriculum is accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools. In addition, the university works to recruit local, national and international students to broaden and create a diversified student population, as 95% of its current students are natives of the US Virgin Islands. The university also has several academic programs under its College of Science and Mathematics. One of these is an engineering program, where students attend UVI for three years and then transfer to either Columbia University, the University of Florida, Washington University in St. Louis, or the University of South Carolina (Columbia) to complete the last two years of their engineering studies. After completing the program, students will acquire a Bachelor of Science in Applied Mathematics from UVI and a Bachelor of Science in their specialization of engineering from the partner university. The Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with concentration in computational biology is offered on both St. Thomas and St. Croix. Students will be able to focus in fields related to parallel computing, data mining, bioinformatics, computational science or cyber-security. The university also has an early medical school selection program with Boston University which affords selected students to study for three years at UVI and then transfer to Boston University Medical School in their senior year. They are then granted the opportunity to take medical school courses early. The university also holds several National Science Foundation-funded research grants and programs including MBRS-RISE, SEAGEP, HBCU-UP, and MARC under its Emerging Caribbean Scientist (ECS) program. The mission of the ECS programs is to increase research training and promote excellence for science, technology, engineering, mathematics and psychology students at the University of the Virgin Islands. The university fosters research by hosting research symposiums every semester where students are given the opportunity to present research projects conducted both locally and abroad, to the UVI faculty and the Virgin Islands community. ===The Caribbean Writer=== The Caribbean Writer – subtitled \\"Where the Caribbean Imagination Embraces the World\\" – is an international, refereed, literary journal, founded in 1986 and published annually by UVI. The stated mission of the journal is to \\"publish quality writing by established and emerging writers that reflects the culture of the Caribbean; promote and foster a strong literary tradition; serve as an institute for the development of emerging writers throughout the Caribbean\\". The current editor of the journal is Alscess Lewis-Brown. The journal's founding editor was Erika J. Waters, now Professor Emeritus of English at UVI.The Caribbean Writer home page. Subsequent editors have included Marvin Williams, Opal Palmer Adisa, and]Tregenza Roach.\\"Marvin E. Williams, R.I.P.\\", Geoffrey Philp, April 11, 2010. The Caribbean Writer announced the past issues online in the Digital Library of the Caribbean (dLOC) as Open Access in 2016. ===Marine biology program=== The marine biology program attracts students from all parts of the world. The University is next to John Brewers Bay, which hosts a variety of marine life and is studied by both undergrad and masters students. ===National Student Exchange (NSE)=== At UVI, students from around the nation are allowed to participate in a semester or year-long exchange to UVI through the National Student Exchange. Tuition is paid toward either the student's home or host school. Students who attend UVI are also able to participate in the NSE program as long as they have completed their freshman year. ===Online programs=== In 2018, the UVI started offering undergraduate and graduate degree programs online in science, arts & business administration. Courses start at the second Wednesday of each month and run for eight weeks. In addition to new programs, the UVI online students will also have the option to complete a mini-residency program on the island of St. Thomas while earning academic credit. ==Student life== View from campus The university offers counselling and career services including interpersonal, personal, social and cognitive development education. ===Clubs and organizations=== At the University of the Virgin Islands St. Thomas campus there are various clubs and organizations such as Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority, Anguilla Student Association, Chess Club, Criminal Justice Club, Delta Sigma Theta sorority, Foods Committee, Golden Key Int'l Honour Society, Japanese Club, Psychology Student Association, Queen's Committee, Social & Cultural Committee, Sports Committee, Student Nursing Association, UVI ACS Student Chemistry Club, UVI French Club, UVI St. Kitts/Nevis Association, Dominican Association, BVI Association, Interact (in conjunction with the local Rotary International Club), Queens Court Club, R.E.A.C.H, Carnival Committee, Cheerleading Squad and Dance Team. UVI's Student Government Association is active on both campuses, particularly the St. Croix campus where (as of the school year 2012–2013) Kevin Dixon serves as president, Estica Caesar, Vice President, Jacqueline Romer, Treasurer, and Amiquah Freeman is secretary. ===Athletics=== UVI is a member of the Inter-university Athletic League (LAI), the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), and the Caribbean University Sports Association. It fields varsity teams for both men and women in basketball, soccer, tennis, volleyball, track and field, cross country, swimming, and table tennis. UVI athletic teams are nicknamed \\"the Buccaneers.\\" They wear blue, white, and gold for athletic events. Currently, the head coach of UVI's men's basketball team is Jeffery Jones. The head coach of the women's basketball team is Reggie Carrick. UVI is a member of the Inter-university athletic league. LAI was established in 1929 and currently consists of the 20 American universities in the Caribbean — 19 in Puerto Rico and the University of the Virgin Islands. As a result, UVI athletes' opponents are often from Puerto Rico, although they play many teams from mainland universities. UVI offers intramural sports activities during both the fall and spring semesters. The University of the Virgin Islands hosts the Paradise Jam Tournament in November of every year. Division I and II basketball teams from across the US mainland compete in a men's and women's basketball tournament. The tournament has national coverage and is a major event in the Virgin Islands. It also serves as an opportunity for these Division I and II teams to play before the spring season and to witness the beauty that the Virgin Islands have to offer. ==Notable alumni== ==References== ==External links== * Official website Category:Liga Atletica Interuniversitaria de Puerto Rico Category:Educational institutions established in 1962 University of the Virgin Category:Universities and colleges in the United States Virgin Islands Category:1962 establishments in the United States Virgin Islands ","title":"University of the Virgin Islands"},{"id":"3236165","text":"Nikolay Andreyevich Gredeskul Nikolay Andreyevich Gredeskul (20 April 1865 – 8 September 1941Тигонен Т.

Тигонен. - Л., 1991. - Вып. 3. - С. 95-156. (воспоминания внучки Н. А. Гредескула)) was a Russian liberal politician. ==Biography== ===Law professor=== After graduating from the University of Kharkiv's law school, Gredeskul became a law professor (1890) and later dean of the law school there . In late 1904, with social tensions rising as Russian defeats in the Russo-Japanese War mounted, he joined other prominent Russian professors in calling for political reform and an academic union and was instrumental in founding the liberal Soyuz Osvobozhdeniya (Liberation League). Gredeskul admitted that the professoriat's traditional hostility to student protests, e.g. during the student unrest in 1899, may have been a mistake . With the easing of restrictions on independent press during the Russian Revolution of 1905, he founded and edited Mir, a liberal newspaper in Kharkiv. ===Liberal politician=== In October 1905, at the height of the revolution, Gredeskul became one of the founding members of the Constitutional Democratic party (aka the Kadet party) and a member of its Central Committee. In December 1905, after the suppression of the Moscow uprising, Gredeskul's paper was closed by the authorities, he was arrested and then exiled to the Arkhangelsk region. While in exile, he was elected to the First State Duma from the Kadets in February 1906, which ended his exile. He went to the capital, St. Petersburg, where he was elected Second Deputy Chairman of the Duma when it was convoked in April 1906. After the government dissolved the Duma on July 9, 1906, Gredeskul signed the Vyborg Manifesto, which called for passive resistance to the government. He was arrested, imprisoned for three months and barred from running in future Duma elections. During the revolution, Gredeskul moved to St. Petersburg and became a professor of law at the St. Petersburg Polytechnical Institute. He coined the term \\"psychology of despair\\" to describe the psychology of the Russian society in the wake of the revolution's defeat . Considered one of the Kadets' leading theoreticians, Gredeskul defended radical traditions of the Russian intelligentsia against criticism from the Right by Vekhi authors in 1909. In late 1911, after the assassination of prime minister Pyotr Stolypin by Bogrov, a former secret police informer, Gredeskul argued that with the decline in revolutionary terrorism after 1907, the government should abandon its covert operations as well . ===Nationalist evolution=== Although at first Gredeskul was somewhat to the Left of the Constitutional Democratic party's center , after 1910 he moved to the Right and in 1912-1914 argued for an alliance with the Progressive faction and the Left wing of the Octobrists . In 1916, at the height of World War I, he published a pamphlet on the problem of ethnic minorities in Russia, which suggested that his views were evolving in the nationalist direction . In 1916 he began writing for Alexander Protopopov's Russkaya Volya (Russian Will), a nationalist newspaper, which led to Gredeskul's resignation from the Kadet Central Committee. Gredeskul edited Russkaya Volya between the February Revolution of 1917 and the October Revolution of 1917, when it was closed down by the new Bolshevik government. ===After the 1917 Revolution=== After the Bolshevik takeover, Gredeskul stayed in Soviet Russia and argued that Russian intellectuals should come to terms with the new government, which he saw as evolving in a more nationalist direction, anticipating Nikolay Ustryalov's ideas by a few months. In the summer of 1920, Bolshevik authorities arranged a speaking tour of the country for him . In the 1920s, Grudeskul joined the Communist Party and was employed by the government as a university professor in Leningrad. He tried to combine Marx and Nietzsche in his book Russia, Before and Now (Rossiia prezhde i teper): :Superman, if one looks only at his internal meaning ... is a man of superior will and superior doubts ... in this internal meaning [the image of Superman] is glorious to a proletarian, not at all so to a bourgeois. ==Works== *\\"К учению об осуществлении права\\" (On the Theory of Law Implementation), Kharkov, 1900, 235 pp. *\\"Социологическое изучение права\\" (Sociological Study of the Law), St. Petersburg, 1900, 13 pp. *\\"Лекции по общей теории права\\" (Lectures on the General Theory of the Law), St. Petersburg, 1909, 317 pp. *\\"Россия и её народы: Великая Россия как программа разрешения национального вопроса в России\\" (Russia and her Peoples: Great Russia as a Program to Solve the Nationalities Question in Russia), Petrograd, M.

The player throws a number of marbles onto a grid of holes, and the numbers of those holes award points which it is suggested can be converted into prizes. In reality, it is almost impossible for a player to win enough points for the prize. According to gaming expert Darwin Ortiz, the Razzle is seldom, if ever, run honestly. This generic name of Razzle is seldom known to players, as it is generally presented under a name such as Football, Baseball, Ten Points Win, Mo-Co, Indian Poker or Cajun Bingo, selected to generate interest for the locals. The nature of the game makes it a particular money-maker for dishonest carnies. ==Play== Razzle consists of a large playing board with over a hundred holes numbered 1 through 6. A player makes a bet by spilling eight marbles onto the board from a cup, and the numbers of the holes they land in are added together and referenced on a chart that looks something like a calendar, telling the player how many points they have won for that roll. Around half of the squares on the chart show a point bonus, while the other half are empty and score nothing. In football themed versions of the game, points scored are \\"yards\\". Significant prizes can be on offer, valued in the hundreds of dollars, but they can be won only when a player has reached a particular point or yard total. In most Razzle set-ups, the player must bet one unit of currency (dollar, pound, Euro) per roll. Whenever the player throws a total of 29, the game is \\"doubled\\": the player must pay twice as much for all future rolls, but will receive an extra prize at the end of the game. Jay Mallin records the game being played with eight dice instead of marbles and holes, in Cuban nightclubs and casinos in the 1950s. After complaints from the American embassy about tourists losing money in the clubs of Havana, President Fulgencio Batista ordered the game to be shut down. ==Scam== The points-per-number chart is the secret. The scattered order of the chart obscures the fact that the point-scoring squares are exclusively among the higher and lower throws. Graph of the likelihoods of particular throws in a game of Razzle, where throws from 20 to 36 score nothing. A red bar is a throw that scores points, while a gray bar does not score. A chart might list numbers from 8 through to 48, where a result in a middle range of 20 through 36 is shown as scoring the player nothing, while results 8 through 19 and 37 through 48 all pay out. Visually this would mean that more than half of the squares on the chart showed a payout (with 22 winning squares and only 16 losing ones), and a player might instinctively conclude that more than half of their throws will pay out. In reality, more than 98% of a player's throws would land in the 20-to-36 range. Further to this, around 10% of throws will total to 29, and although this is presented as penalty for both sides (\\"Player and Operator must Double on Number 29\\") it merely accelerates the rate at which the player hands over their money: the operator will never lose, so doubling the size of the prize is meaningless. Even if the game were run honestly, the mathematical nature of the razzle board makes it extremely unlikely that a player would ever win before running out of money, or that the value of the prizes won would ever equal the amount of money spent chasing them. The game operator conceals this from the player by using a fast and incorrect count to, when it suits the operator, pretend that a throw scored when it did not. This is used initially to hook the player into the game by giving the player a generous number of wins in the opening throws of the game, taking them some way to the prize point total and giving the impression that the remaining points can be obtained just as easily. Once the player has become invested in the game, the operator will switch to counting the throws accurately, with nearly all of them being losses. If the player starts to show reluctance to continue, the operator will dole out just enough miscounted points to keep them at the table. Increasingly the player believes that walking away would be a disaster - they only need one or two more points to win the prize. Unfortunately for the player, they will only get those points if the operator allows it. According to Darwin Ortiz, most Razzle operators are not satisfied until they get their mark's last dollar. The Razzle is such a devastatingly effective scam that some crooked booth operators have been known to even abandon their store's theme and \\"bring out the razzle\\". On a block in New Orleans in the early 2000s, tourists had reported losses of up to $18,000 to the scam. At Havana's Sans Souci Cabaret nightclub in the early 1950s, one American tourist reportedly lost $30,000 in a single night (). ==References== ==External links== * Razzle Dazzle game simulator * Odds for one version of Razzle Category:Dice games Category:Carnival games Category:Scams ","title":"Razzle (game)"},{"id":"3236193","text":"When I Look Down That Road is an album by Melissa Manchester, released in 2004. ==Track listing== All songs written by Melissa Manchester, except where noted. # \\"I'll Know You By Your Heart\\" (Melissa Manchester, Sharon Vaughn) - 4:35 # \\"Angels Dancing\\" (Manchester, Jeff Silbar) - 5:07 # \\"Bend\\" (Manchester, Wendy Lands) - 4:20 # When Paris Was A Woman (According To Alice – 1928) - 5:24 # \\"After All This Time\\" (Manchester, Blue Miller) - 3:51 # Lucky Break (Manchester, Beth Nielsen Chapman) - 3:39 # \\"When I Look Down That Road\\" (Manchester, Stephony Smith) - 3:09 # \\"Where The Truth Lies\\" (Manchester, Rupert Holmes) - 4:01 # TYFYFIM (Thank You For Your Faith In Me) (Manchester, Zuriani Zonneveld) - 3:47 # \\"Still Myself\\" (Manchester, Pam Rose) - 3:38 # \\"Crazy Loving You\\" (Manchester, Paul Williams) - 4:02 # \\"A Mother's Prayer\\" (Manchester, Karen Taylor-Good) - 3:51 # \\"It's The Light\\" (Bonus Track on Japanese CD) ==Personnel== * Melissa Manchester – lead vocals, backing vocals (1, 2, 4-11), grand piano (3, 9, 12), string arrangements (3, 4) * Stephan Oberhoff – grand piano (1, 5), acoustic guitar (1, 2, 3, 5-11), electric guitar (1, 2, 5, 9, 10, 11), bass programming (1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11), additional percussion (1, 2, 11), drum programming (2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11), pump organ (3, 6, 7, 10), bass (3, 10), harp (3), string arrangements (3, 4), synthesizer (4, 6, 8, 9), additional guitar (4), Hammond B3 organ (5), cello programming (7), percussion (8, 9), slide guitar (11) * Peter Hume – acoustic guitar (4) * Keb' Mo' – dobro (5), slide guitar (5) * Richie Kotzen – electric guitar (6), backing vocals (6) * Tom Brechtlein – drums (1, 5) * Kevin DeRemer – drums (2), percussion (2), grand piano (5), Hammond B3 organ (5), acoustic guitar (5, 6), electric guitar (5), bass programming (5, 6), drum programming (5, 6), synthesizer (6), pump organ (6) * Cassio Duarte – percussion (1, 4, 6, 11) * Bara M'Boup – African percussion solo (2) * Tollak Ollestad – harmonica (2), bass harmonica (2), backing vocals (5, 6, 9) * Lynn Angebranndt – cello (3, 9) * Matthew Cooker – cello (4) * Doug Norwine – clarinet (6) ===Production=== * Produced and Arranged by Kevin DeRemer and Stephan Oberhoff * Executive Producers – Kevin DeRemer and Melissa Manchester * Recording Engineers – Sjoerd Koppert, Stephan Oberhoff and Joe Vannelli. * Assistant Engineer – Joe Primeau * Mixed by Joe Vannelli * ProTools Editing – Stephan Oberhoff * Mastered by Brian Gardner at Bernie Grundman Mastering (Hollywood, CA). * A&R; – David Wilkes * Product Manager – Dan O'Leary * Art Direction – Jeff Gilligan * Photography – Randee St. Nicholas Category:2004 albums Category:Melissa Manchester albums ","title":"When I Look Down That Road"},{"id":"3236194","text":"Hephzibah Menuhin (20 May 19201 January 1981) was an American-Australian pianist, writer, and human rights campaigner. She was sister to the violinist Yehudi Menuhin and to the pianist, painter, and poet Yaltah Menuhin. She was also a linguist and writer, co-authoring several books and writing many papers with her second husband, Richard Hauser. ==Early life== Hephzibah Menuhin was born in San Francisco, California. Through her father Moshe Menuhin, a former rabbinical student and anti-Zionist writer, Menuhin was descended from a distinguished rabbinical dynasty. Her mother, Marutha, has been described as \\"dominant and controlling\\".Penguin Group (Australia) The Menuhin children had little formal schooling. Hephzibah spent only five days at a San Francisco school, where she was classed as educationally backward. Her parents took her out of school and taught her to read and write at home.Hall of Fame , liveperformance.com.au; accessed 4 February 2018. She started studying the piano at the age of four, initially with Judith Blockley, a specialist in teaching young children, and later with Lev Shorr, a Russian-born grand-pupil of Theodor Leschetizky and future teacher of Leon Fleisher.Jacqueline Kent, An Exacting Heart: The Story of Hephzibah Menuhin, pp. 21, 34. She gave her first recital in San Francisco in 1928 when she was eight. She then studied with Rudolf Serkin in Basel and Marcel Ciampi in Paris. In 1933 she and Yehudi made their first recording (a Mozart sonata), which won the Candid Prize as best disc of the year. Her public debut was on 13 October 1934, at the Salle Pleyel in Paris. The siblings performed in the New York Town Hall and Queen's Hall in London, and Hephzibah gave solo recitals in most of the major cities of Europe and America. ===Australian connection=== In March 1938, after a concert at the Royal Albert Hall, Bernard Heinze introduced Hephzibah and Yehudi to the Australian brother and sister, Lindsay and Nola Nicholas, heirs to the Australian 'Aspro' pharmaceutical fortune.Aspro pharma, biotechnology- innovation.com.au; accessed 4 February 2018. In quick succession, Yehudi (aged 21) married Nola, and Hephzibah (aged 17) married Lindsay, abandoning her plans to give her debut recital in Carnegie Hall, New York. She moved with Lindsay Nicholas to his grazing property \\"Terrinallum\\" near Derrinallum, Victoria, where she spent the next 13 years.Clips, australianscreen.com.au; accessed 4 February 2018. She started a traveling library for children and bore two sons, Kronrod and Marston Nicholas. However, while she curtailed her musical career, she did not entirely abandon it. She played with the Sydney and Melbourne Symphony Orchestras and she and Yehudi played together many times during his 1940 tour of Australia. She gave solo recitals, supported local activities such as the Griller Quartet, and was involved with Richard Goldner in the foundation of Musica Viva Australia. She befriended many displaced European musicians who had emigrated to Australia. During this time she played the Australian premiere of Bartók's Second Piano Concerto. Both of the Menuhins' marriages to the Nicholases ended in divorce. Hephzibah's own two children remained with their father, Lindsay Nicholas. ==Career and causes== In 1947, she played at the Prague Spring Music Festival in a concert organised by Paul Morawetz, a Melbourne businessman. He took her to see the Theresienstadt concentration camp, which had a profound effect on her, forcing her to confront the meaning of her own Jewish heritage, and they entered a romantic relationship which lasted for several years. In 1951 she and Yehudi played at the opening of the Royal Festival Hall in London, then made a concert tour of Australia and played and broadcast for the ABC. She supported all types of causes with concerts and recitals, such as the National Music Camp Association, and she was outspoken about the influence of television on children. In Sydney she was soloist in Juan José Castro's piano concerto, with the composer conducting (he was at that time the chief conductor of the Victorian Symphony Orchestra). In 1954 she moved to Sydney, where she gave concerts and opened her home to anyone in need.Archive of Australian Judaica, judaica.library.usyd.edu.au; accessed 4 February 2018. ===London=== In Sydney, Hephzibah Menuhin met and became involved with Richard Hauser, an Austrian Quaker sociologist and social commentator who had moved to Sydney with his family, then wife Ruth Hauser, and their daughter Eva. Hephzibah divorced her husband and married Hauser in Sydney in 1955. Two years later Menuhin and Hauser moved to London with their daughter, Clara Menuhin-Hauser, where they fostered Michael Alexander Morgan, a boy of mixed Welsh and Nigerian background and who grew up with Clara.Diary:Jacqueline Kent, flinders.edu.au; accessed 4 February 2018. They founded the Institute for Human Rights and Responsibilities, and the Centre for Group Studies, and later moved to Friends Hall, a Quaker settlement house in Bethnal Green, in the East End of London. They later ran a Human Rights refuge from their house at 16 Ponsonby Place in Pimlico. This also became the base for The Institute for Social Research, which Sir Richard Hauser ran until his death. They worked on small-steps conciliation and attempted to help minorities all over the world, and she was a passionate supporter of women's and children's rights. In 1977 Hephzibah Menuhin became the President of the British chapter of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom. Hephzibah and Richard Hauser wrote \\"The Fraternal Society\\" (Bodley Head) together. In 1962 she and Yehudi toured Australia. She toured with Yehudi and the Menuhin Festival Orchestra: the United States and Canada in 1967, and Australia in 1970 and 1975. In 1977 she was a member of the judges' panel for the first Sydney International Piano Competition. In Melbourne that year she played at a concert at which her son, Dr Marston Nicholas, made his public debut as a cellist. In 1979 Hephzibah Menuhin made her last Australian concert appearances, playing with Yehudi and the Sydney String Quartet. She appeared with her brother for the last time at the Royal Festival Hall in London in November 1979. ==Death and legacy== Hephzibah Menuhin died in London on 1 January 1981, following a lengthy illness. Her brother, Yehudi, dedicated his Carnegie Hall concert of 22 February 1981 to her memory. Her recordings include Schubert's Trout Quintet with members of the Amadeus Quartet, Mozart concertos with her brother conducting, trios with Yehudi and Maurice Gendron, and sonatas with Yehudi. ==Memorial== The annual $8,000 Hephzibah Menuhin Memorial Scholarship for young Australian pianists was established in 1980. It is administered alternatively by the University of Melbourne Faculty of Music and the Sydney Conservatorium of Music. The principal soloist's dressing room at the Melbourne Arts Centre's Hamer Hall was named in Hephzibah's honour. In 1998 Curtis Levy produced and directed a documentary, Hephzibah. A biography An Exacting Heart was published in 2008 by Jacqueline Kent. A biography of Yehudi Menuhin and his family entitled Yehudiana – Reliving the Menuhin Odyssey by Philip Bailey, who worked on the Menuhin staff from 1976 until Yehudi's death in 1999, was published in late 2008. This book contains some information concerning Hephzibah's life. ==References== ==External links== * Short biography (from the ABC Radio National website).

It features call-and-response lyrics (especially common in Who lyrics at this time) and some of the first ever recorded guitar feedback. The song was composed by lead singer Roger Daltrey and guitarist Pete Townshend, the only time they wrote together. The guitar feedback, although not the first to be heard on a record (see the Beatles' \\"I Feel Fine\\"), is thought to be the first solo with feedback. This is the first Who release with Nicky Hopkins playing piano. == Overview == === Composition === \\"Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere\\" has a significant similarity to \\"Out in the Street\\", which appears on their debut album My Generation. Both songs feature a three-chord strum before \\"blasting into an uptempo rhythm\\"; Despite this, \\"Out in the Street\\" is a marginally older song, and both tracks originate from the same recording sessions between 13 and 14 April 1965. The use of feedback throughout the song was crucial, according to Townshend, who stated that the group \\"were trying to achieve the sound which we get on the stage at present, all in a commercial song that will sell.\\" He would later claim that \\"Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere\\" was an attempt to write a very spiritual song. Brett Milano of udiscovermusic.com rated Townsend's guitar solo as one of the 100 all-time greatest, \\"cramming all kinds of great noises – feedback, air-raid sirens, and good old guitar destruction – into the brief space he had.\\" === Release === \\"Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere\\" was released on 21 May 1965 with \\"Daddy Rolling Stone\\", written by Otis Blackwell, on the B-Side. The release coincided with an appearance on Ready Steady Go! by the group, in which they perform this and \\"Shout and Shimmy\\". \\"Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere\\" fitted the mood of Ready Steady Go! so well that the show adapted it as their intro for a while. In the US, the feedback present in the recording startled Decca Records, who believed they'd received a faulty tape of the song. The song was released on 5 June 1965 in the US. \\"Daddy Rolling Stone\\" was replaced by \\"Anytime You Want Me\\" for this release. The single became the Who's second top-ten single after \\"I Can't Explain\\", reaching number ten on the UK Singles Chart. It remained in the top forty for eleven weeks, with six weeks in the top twenty, and one in the top ten. It also became a top forty single in France, reaching number thirty-eight, but it failed to match the success that \\"I Can't Explain\\" had in the US: whereas that was a top-hundred hit (peaking at 93), \\"Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere\\" failed to chart on the Billboard Hot 100. It sold approximately eighty-eight thousand copies in the UK. The song was rarely played live for most of The Who's career past 1965, but since 1999 has become a staple for their live shows; it appears on the album Live at the Royal Albert Hall. It can also be found on BBC Sessions and The Kids Are Alright. == Personnel == The Who * Roger Daltrey – lead vocals * Pete Townshend – electric guitar, backing vocals * John Entwistle – bass guitar, backing vocals * Keith Moon – drums Additional musicians * Nicky Hopkins – piano ==Other versions== David Bowie recorded a version of this song for his Pin Ups album in 1973. The Flaming Lips recorded a version of this song which appeared on a Mojo magazine CD of Who covers called Mojo: The Who Covered. A version of this song has also been recorded by Ocean Colour Scene for The Who tribute album Substitute – The Songs of The Who. ==References== Category:1965 singles Category:The Who songs Category:Song recordings produced by Shel Talmy Category:Songs written by Pete Townshend Category:1965 songs Category:Songs written by Roger Daltrey Category:Brunswick Records singles ","title":"Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere"},{"id":"3236208","text":"William Berger, also known as Bill Berger and Wilhelm Berger, born Wilhelm Thomas Berger (June 20, 1928 – October 2, 1993) was an Austrian American actor, mostly associated with Euro and spaghetti Westerns, as well as travel documentaries. ==Biography== ===Career=== Berger in Faccia a faccia (1967) A former roommate of Keith Richards, his earliest work was in Broadway theatre, but while visiting Italy, he was cast in his first Western, Break Up, in 1965.

Berger was heavily into drug experimentation, which frequent co-star Brett Halsey said sometimes interfered with filming, recounting one incident where they were shooting a scene on horseback and without warning Berger leant forwards and slid off his horse. In the early 1970s, Berger spent some time in an Italian prison, having been wrongly accused of possession of hashish and cocaine, but resumed his acting career after his release. His later fare included Super Fly T.N.T. (1973), Oil! (1977), Hercules (1983), and The King's Whore (1990). His 1985 memoirs, Half Way Home, recount his life to that point. Berger collaborated with his good friend, famed Spanish horror film director Jesus Franco, appearing in seven of his films: The Sinister Eyes of Dr. Orloff, Night of the Killers, Faceless, Golden Temple Amazons, Love Letters of a Portuguese Nun, Dirty Game in Casablanca, and A Captain of 15 Years. ==Personal life== William Berger was married five times and was father to five children. He had three children with his first wife Marjorie Berger: daughters Carin Berger (born in 1952) and actress Debra Berger (born March 17, 1957), and son Wendell Nelson Berger (born December 28, 1972). After his marriage to Marjorie ended, he married actress Carolyn Lobravico. While Berger was busy with the filming of The Murder Clinic, Carolyn was arrested for drug possession. A diabetic, she died in prison from lack of insulin. His third marriage was to singer and actress Hanja Kochansky. They had one child together, son Kasimir Berger (born in London on October 7, 1974). Berger was also stepfather to actress Katya Berger, daughter of Hanja Kochansky from a previous relationship. Berger starred with his son Kasimir in the TV miniseries Christopher Columbus and Tuareg – The Desert Warrior. After his divorce from Kochansky, he married his fourth wife, Dörte Völz. With her, he had a son named Alexander Völz. His fifth and last marriage was to Linda Berger. William Berger died on October 2, 1993 in Los Angeles, California, of prostate cancer. Jesus Franco was particularly upset by his passing, speaking of his grief in various interviews. ==Selected filmography== *Back Street (1961) - Airport Attendant (uncredited) *Von Ryan's Express (1965) - Man from the Gestapo (uncredited) *Break Up (1965) - Benny (segment \\"L'uomo dei 5 palloni\\") (uncredited) *Ringo's Big Night (1966) - Jack Balman / Ringo *The Murder Clinic (1966) - Dr. Robert Vance *Cisco (1966) - El Cisco *A Bullet for the General (1967) - Bill 'Niño' Tate (English version, voice, uncredited) *Her Harem (1967) - Mario *The Day the Fish Came Out (1967) - Man in Bed *Face to Face (1967) - Charley 'Chas' A.

The House of La Trémoïlle (Maison de La Trémoille in French) was a French noble family from Poitou whose name comes from the village La Trimouille in the départment of Vienne. This family has been known since the middle of the 11th century, and since the 14th century its members have been conspicuous in French history as nobles, military leaders and crusaders, and influential as political leaders, diplomats, Huguenots and courtiers. The male line of the family died out in 1933, while female line heirs of the last duke have kept the La Trémoïlle surname alive in Belgium. == Lords and crusaders== Pierre, the first known seigneur (or sire) of La Trémoïlle, was settled in Poitou, and died after 1040. His descendant, Guy, accompanied Godefroy de Bouillon to the Holy Land as a crusader in 1096. Upon his return, he had the abbey of Reims rebuilt, and died after 1145. His son, Guillaume, joined the expedition of Louis VII of France to the Holy Land as a crusader. Guillaume's great-grandson, Thibaut, crusaded alongside St. Louis, and was killed, along with three of his sons, on 8 February 1250 in battle at Mansoura in Egypt. In 1269 another Guy de La Trémoïlle, who is numbered \\"I\\" in the family lineage, paid homage to his liege, Alphonse, Count of Poitou, and died sometime after 1301. Guy IV (d. 1350), predeceased his father, Guy III, having been designated Grand Panetier of France. His son, Guy V (1346-1398), was called \\"The Valiant\\" according to Père Anselme, being a renowned warrior, the confidante of Philip the Hardy of Burgundy, and later counselor in the service of Charles VI of France, whose Oriflamme he carried into battle against the English in 1382. He journeyed with Louis II, Duke of Bourbon on crusade to Africa, and died in Rhodes en route to France, having been ransomed in 1396 following imprisonment at Nicopolis. His son George (1382-1444), became Grand Chamberlain of France in 1406 and husband in 1416 of Joan II, Countess of Auvergne, thereby also acquiring the counties of Boulogne and Guînes. His rivalry with Arthur de Richemont, rather than hostility to Joan of Arc, is believed to have slowed her crusade's momentum against the English, allowing them to capture and burn her at the stake in 1431.Pernoud, Marie- Véronique and Clin, Régine. Louis of Luxembourg. Joan of Arc: Her Story. Palgrave Macmillan. 1999. p. 80. . His family's rise to wealth and power made him a target, and he was ransomed after capture thrice; after the Battle of Agincourt, once again by the English, and at Chinon, whence he was taken from the king's side and held prisoner at Montrésor. His grandson Louis II (1460-1525), commanded French troops in the conquest of Lombardy for Louis XII. Defeated and wounded fighting the Swiss at Novarra in 1513, he redeemed his reputation by raising the siege of Marseilles against the Constable de Bourbon's Imperial troops in 1523 before being killed at the Battle of Pavia in 1524. In 1485 he had wed the princesse du sang Gabrielle de Bourbon, daughter of Louis I, comte de Montpensier, subsequently marrying the daughter of Cesare Borgia. He inherited from his mother Marguerite d'Amboise, vicomtesse de Thouars, the title, \\"prince de Talmond\\", which Du Cange noted, in his Glossarium mediæ et infimæ latinitatis, had become attached to an allodial seigneurie in the Vendée.Heraldica.org, Francois Velde, Talmond: A list of French Princes and Principalities, 21 January 2008, retrieved 7 November 2018 It was his grandson, François de La Trémoïlle (1505-1541), who succeeded Louis II in his titles, his father Charles, prince de Talmond (1486-1515), having been killed at the Battle of Marignano. He was taken prisoner at the battle of Pavia at which his grandfather was killed, but was subsequently ransomed. François wed the heiress Anne de Laval in 1521, who eventually brought to their descendants the pretendership to a royal throne. Their two younger sons, George (died 1584) and Claude (died 1566) founded, respectively, the branches of the marquis d'Royan (extinct 1698) and of the ducs de Noirmoutier (extinct 1733). The eldest son of François de La Trémoïlle, Louis III (1521-1577), was the first of his family to obtain ducal status when Charles IX conferred that honor upon him in 1563. His son with Jeanne de Montmorency, Claude (1566-1604), had the dukedom elevated into a peerage in 1595, although it was not registered as hereditary in the Parlement until 1599. He had converted to Protestantism and fought for the Huguenots during the French Wars of Religion at the battles of Coutras in 1587, Ivry in 1590 and Fontaine-Française in 1595, and at the sieges of Paris and Rouen. In 1598 he married Charlotte Brabantine of Orange-Nassau (1580-1631), daughter of the Protestant Dutch leader William the Silent. Claude's sister, Charlotte Catherine de La Trémoille (d. 1619), married Henri I de Bourbon, prince de Condé (1552-1588) in 1586, but when he died suddenly six months before the birth of their only son in September 1588, she was imprisoned on suspicion of having poisoned her husband to prevent the child's rejection as a bastard, although the king recognized the child as premier prince du sang and heir presumptive to the crown until the birth of his own son, the future Louis XIII, in 1601. The third duc de Thouars, Henri (1599-1674), was present at the Siege of La Rochelle in October 1628, after which he was obliged to abjure Protestantism for Catholicism while face-to-face with the victorious Cardinal Richelieu. He fought for France thereafter, at Pas-de-Suze in 1629, at the siege of Corbie in 1636, and was wounded at Carignano in 1629. Of his marriage with his cousin in 1619, Marie de La Tour d'Auvergne (1601-1665), daughter of Henri, Duke of Bouillon, was born Henri-Charles de La Trémoïlle (1620-1672), fourth duc de Thouars and prince de Tarente. He lived much of his life outside of France, serving as a cavalry general in the service of the Estates of Holland and holding the post of governor of Bois-le-Duc. He married a German princess, Emilie of Hesse-Cassel (1626-1693), in 1648, and only returned to France and converted to Catholicism two years before his death, in September 1670. His great-grandson, Charles Armand René de La Trémoïlle (1683-1719) became the seventh duc de Thouars in father-to-son succession. He received the position of Premier Gentilhomme de la Chambre du Roi, which had become a family sinecure. In 1725 he married his cousin, Marie Hortense de La Tour d'Auvergne (1704-1788), daughter of Emmanuel-Théodose, Duke of Bouillon. ==Claim to kingdom of Naples== In the 17th century the La Trémoïlle family put forth a claim to the throne of the Kingdom of Naples. Henry de La Trémoïlle, in representation of his great-grandmother Anne de Laval (1505–1554), wife of François de la Trémoïlle, was the sole heir to King Frederick of Naples. Ferdinand I (1423-1494), an illegitimate son of King Alfonso V of Aragon, managed to become king of Naples in 1458, although upon his death his son Alfonso II (1452-1504) was driven out by France. Alfonso II's only legitimate child, Charlotte (1480-1506), was married in 1500 to Nicolas de Montmorency, comte de Laval. Her younger daughter Anne married in 1521 Louis I de La Trémoïlle, vicomte de Thouars. By this connection the La Trémoïlle claimed the title \\"Prince of Tarento\\", along with the inheritance of Montmorency-Laval (it had passed to the Rieux family on the death of Guy XVI in 1531, then through Claude de Rieux, comtesse de Laval et Montfort, to François de Coligny in 1547, and on the death in 1605 of his grandson Guy XX, to the La Trémoïlle). Henri-Charles (1599-1674), duc de Thouars, received royal confirmation of the rank of foreign prince in 1651; he bore as arms Quarterly Or a chevron gules between three eagles azure (La Trémoïlle), France, Bourbon-Montpensier and Montmorency-Laval. His eldest son Charles-Belgique-Hollande (1655-1709) bore Quarterly France and Two-Sicilies, over all La Trémoïlle, the younger son Frédéric-Guillaume (d. 1739) was titled prince de Talmond; he acquired the lordship of Châtellerault and had it raised to a dukedom for his son in 1730, but the latter died without issue in 1759 and the title of Talmond returned to the eldest branch. The 13th and last duke of Thouars, 13th prince de Tarente and 17th prince de Talmond died in 1933. In 1643 he asserted his rights to that crown jure uxoris, and his descendants would continue to do so at various diplomatic conferences, in vain. Louis XIII, however, recognized the duc de La Trémoïlle's assumption of \\"Prince of Taranto\\" as a title of pretence and, by patent issued in 1629, granted him and his family the rank and prerogatives of princes étrangers at the French court.Mémoires de la société des antiquaires de l’Ouest, 1867, page 40. In 1648, Louis XIV allowed him to send a representative in presented their claims before the Congress of Munster, where the Treaty of Westphalia was concluded. The princes de Tarente also sought to their dynastic rights recognized at the congresses of Munster, Nijmegen and Ryswyk, but without success.Marie-Nicolas Bouillet, Dictionnaire universel d'histoire et de géographie, Hachette, 1858, page 1009. On November 6, 1748 the La Trémoïlle family made a final protest concerning their rights to the kingdom of Naples which had been yielded by the Treaty of Vienna of 1738 to the King of Sicily.Louis duc de La Trémoille Les La Trémoille pendant cinq siècles, Éditeur E. Grimaud, 1896, pages 88-91 « Dernière protestation de la maison de La Trémoille, relative à ses droits sur le royaume de Naples » ==Extinction== Louis Jean Marie de La Trémoille (8 February 1910 – 9 December 1933), prince and 12th duc de La Trémoille, 13th duc de Thouars, 13th prince de Tarente and 17th prince de Talmond,Almanach de Gotha, La Trémoïlle. Justus Perthes, 1944, p.463. French. was the only son and heir of Louis Charles de La Trémoïlle, 12th duc de Thouars and 12th Prince of Taranto, and was the last male of the historic La Trémoille family. He died, unmarried and childless, at the age of 23 at the estate of Leander J. McCormick (son of L. Hamilton McCormick) in Whitchurch, Hampshire. It was noted in the New York Times at the time that his mysterious death by fire in England evoked the martyrdom at English hands of Joan of Arc five centuries earlier, who had been betrayed by the young duke's ancestor, Georges de La Trémoïlle, founder of the family's fortune in France. Although the 1944 Almanach de Gotha states that his successor, as 14th duchesse de Thouars, was the eldest of his four sisters, Charlotte (1892-1971), the Genealogisches Handbuch des Adels of 1991 refrains from doing so,Genealogisches Handbuch des Adels, Furstlicher Hauser Bande XIV, C.A.

The only son of the 1910 marriage of Charlotte de La Trémoïlle with Prince Henri Florent de Ligne (1881-1967), head of the Antoing cadet branch of that princely family, had de La Trémoïlle appended to his own surname in the Kingdom of Belgium as \\"Jean Charles, Prince de Ligne de La Trémoille\\" (1911-2005) on 20 December 1934, and his only son, Prince Charles- Antoine (born 1946), bears the same title and name. ==Doubts about extinction== Although the main branch is extinct, it seems that the Maison de La Trémoille remains since the journalist and photographer Georges de La Trémoille is mentioned, on , during the TF1 https://www.lci.fr/international/maree-noire-a-maurice-la-france-vient-en- aide-al-ile-depuis-la-reunion- apres-echouement-wakashio-2161237.html newscast and as well as in several newspaper articles such as Le Monde https://www.lemonde.fr/planete/article/2020/08/ 08 / when-biodiversity-is-in- danger-there-is-an-urgency-to-act-in-France-announces-help-against-the-oil- spill-in-maurice_6048485_3244.html , Euronewshttps://www.euronews.com/2020/08/08/mauritius-declares-state-of- environmental-emergency-after-oil-leak-from-stranded-ship and Sky Newshttps://news.sky.com/story/mauritius-declares-environmental-emergency- after-mass-oil-spill-from-grounded-tanker-12044845. ==Chief line== Viscounts of Thouars (elevated to duke 1563), Princes of Talmont, etc. * Louis I de La Trémoille * Louis II de La Trémoille, son, called the chevalier sans reproche (\\"knight beyond reproach\\"), defeated and captured Francis II, Duke of Brittany at the Battle of Saint-Aubin-du-Cormier (1488), distinguished himself in the Italian Wars, and was killed at the Battle of Pavia (1525). * Charles I de La Trémoille, son, died in his father's lifetime and under his command at the Battle of Marignano (1515). * François II de La Trémoille, son, acquired a claim on the Kingdom of Naples by his marriage with Anne de Laval, daughter of Charlotte of Aragon * Louis III de La Trémoille, son, became duke of Thouars in 1563, and his son ** Charlotte Catherine de La Trémoille, princesse de Condé (1568–1629) daughter of the above * Claude de La Trémoille, son, turned Protestant, was created a peer of France in 1595, and married a daughter of William the Silent in 1598. ** Charlotte de La Trémoille, Countess of Derby, daughter * Henri de La Trémoille, son of Claude, 3rd duke of Thouars (died 1674) * Henri Charles de La Trémoille, son of Henry (died 1672) * Charles Belgique Hollande de La Trémoille, son of Henry, 4th duke of Thouars (died 1709) ** Marie Armande Victoire de La Trémoille, daughter of the above, wife of Emmanuel Théodose de La Tour d'Auvergne * Charles Louis Bretagne de La Trémoille, son of Charles-Belgique, 5th duke of Thouars (died 1719) * Charles Armand René de La Trémoille, son of Charles-Louis, 6th duke of Thouars (died 1741) * Jean Bretagne Charles de La Trémoille, son of Charles-Armand, 7th duke of Thouars (died 1792) * Charles Bretagne Marie de La Trémoille, son of Jean- Bretagne, 8th duke of Thouars (died 1839) * Louis Charles de La Trémoille, son of Charles-Bretagne, 9th duke of Thouars (died 1911) * Louis Charles Marie de La Trémoille, son of Louis-Charles, 10th duke of Thouars (died 1921) * Louis Jean Marie de La Trémoille, son of Louis-Charles-Marie, 11th duke of Thouars (died without issue 1933) ==Branches== The family was divided into several branches including, among others: * viscounts and dukes of Thouars * dukes of La Trémoille * princes of Talmont * princes of Tarente * dukes of Châtellerault * dukes of Noirmoutier * marquis of Royan * count of Joigny ==Notable family members== * Guy de la Trémoille, standard-bearer of France, was taken prisoner at the Battle of Nicopolis (1396), and * Georges de la Trémoille (c. 1382 - 6 May 1446) was count de Guînes, the favorite of King Charles VII of France, took part in the Praguerie and was captured at Battle of Azincourt (1415). * Jean de la Trémoille (1377-1449) * Marie Anne de La Trémoille, princesse des Ursins (1642–1722) ==References== * Tremoille ","title":"La Trémoille family"},{"id":"3236224","text":"Subedar-major is the senior rank of junior commissioned officer in the Indian and Pakistani Armies, and formerly a Viceroy's commissioned officer in the British Indian Army.

A battalion's single subedar-major assists the commander in much the same way as a regimental sergeant major would (to the extent that this rank, known as regimental havildar major, is now almost obsolete in the Indian Army).

Altai, Inc., 982 F.2d 693 (2d Cir. 1992)Computer Associates International, Inc. v. Altai, Inc., 982 F.2d 693, (2d Cir. 1992). is a decision from the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit that addressed to what extent non-literal elements of software are protected by copyright law. The court used and recommended a three-step process called the Abstraction-Filtration-Comparison test. The case was an appeal from the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York in which the district court found that defendant Altai's OSCAR 3.4 computer program had infringed plaintiff Computer Associates' copyrighted computer program entitled CA-SCHEDULER. The district court also found that Altai's OSCAR 3.5 program was not substantially similar to a portion of CA- SCHEDULER called ADAPTER, and thus denied relief as to OSCAR 3.5. Finally, the district court concluded that Computer Associate's state law trade secret misappropriation claim against Altai was preempted by the federal Copyright Act. The appeal was heard by Judges Frank X. Altimari, John Daniel Mahoney, and John M. Walker, Jr. The majority opinion was written by Judge Walker. Judge Altimari concurred in part and dissented in part. The Second Circuit affirmed the district court's ruling as to copyright infringement, but vacated and remanded its holding on trade secret preemption. == Background of the case == Computer Associates (CA) created a job scheduling program called CA- SCHEDULER which sorts, runs, and controls the various tasks given to a computer. This scheduler was designed to be compatible with IBM System 370 computers which ran one of three different operating systems: DOS/VSE, MVS, and VM/CMS. Traditionally, a program must be specifically compiled to run on a designated operating system. In order to allow the same code to run on the different operating systems, the CA-SCHEDULER included a component called ADAPTER that was designed to translate the language of the program into commands understandable to that particular operating system. This way the CA- SCHEDULER could use the same code but run on different operating systems. In 1982, Altai established their own job scheduler called ZEKE written for the VSE operating system. In efforts to create a version of ZEKE to run over the MVS operating system, Altai employee James Williams recruited his longtime friend Claude Arney, an employee of Computer Associates, to create the MVS version. Williams claims that at the time he did not know about the ADAPTER component or that Arney had familiarity with the CA-SCHEDULER and ADAPTER code. Arney left CA to work on Altai's ZEKE program, taking the VSE and MVS versions of the source code for ADAPTER with him. Using his knowledge of ADAPTER, Arney then convinced Altai to restructure the program to include a program translator to interface with various operating systems. Arney created the translator OSCAR 3.4 for Altai in which about 30% of OSCAR's source code was taken directly from CA's ADAPTER code. In 1988, CA discovered Altai's use of the CA ADAPTER code and brought an action for copyright infringement and trade secret misappropriation against Altai. In response, Altai ordered a clean room rewrite of the copied portions of the code to be performed by eight programmers who had no knowledge or involvement with the previous OSCAR code. This new program was released as OSCAR 3.5. In the judgment of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, the Honorable George C. Pratt, United States Circuit Judge found that OSCAR 3.4 was a copyright infringement of CA's CA-SCHEDULER and awarded CA $364,444 in damages and apportioned profits. The district court ruled that OSCAR 3.5 rewrite, on the other hand, did not constitute copyright infringement. It also ruled that the state law trade secret claims were preempted by the federal Copyright Act, and thus Altai was not liable for trade secret misappropriation. Initially, both parties appealed the judgment. Altai appealed the judgment on OSCAR 3.4, but subsequently dropped the claim. CA appealed the judgment on OSCAR 3.5 and preemption on trade secret misappropriation. == Relevant law == Prior to this case, it had been well established that software can be protected by copyright law. In particular, previous cases have shown that literal elements of program code are protected by copyright (in Apple Computer, Inc. v. Franklin Computer Corp.Apple Computer, Inc. v. Franklin Computer Corp. , 714 F.2d 1240 (3d Cir. 1983). among others). The issue in this case is whether and to what extent copyright protects non-literal elements of program code, the structure, sequence and organization of the program. Although a few courts had examined this issue, this was the first of its kind in this circuit. == Issues == In the appeal, CA disputed the district court's finding that the OSCAR 3.5 did not have substantial similarity to CA's ADAPTER. They claimed that the district court did not apply a proper test that took into consideration the copying of non-literal elements of computer software. They claimed that despite the clean room rewrite, there was substantial similarity in the structures of ADAPTER including flow charts, inter-modular relationships, parameter lists, macros, and services obtained from the operating system. To approach this issue, the court fully supported the claim that non-literal elements of software are protected under copyright. Software is considered a literary work for the purposes of copyright law, and non-literal elements of literary works are protected under copyright. As such, non-literal elements of software are also protected. The question at hand was to what extent are the non-literal elements protected. Copyright protects the expression of an idea but not the idea itself. As such, it is important to determine where to draw the line between expression and idea. The court agreed with the opinion in Baker v. Selden which stated that things that \\"must necessarily be used as incident to\\" the idea are not subject to copyright protection.Baker v. Selden , 101 U.S. 99 (1879). This opinion, however, gave no advice on how to separate the idea from the expression. Facing a similar issue, Whelan v. Jaslow attempted to delineate the differences between idea and expression by saying that the function of the work is the idea and everything else not necessary to the function is the expression of the idea.Whelan Associates Inc. v. Jaslow Dental Laboratory, Inc. , 797 F.2d 1222 (3d Cir. 1986). The court agreed with district court's refusal to follow the Whelan logic because the test is \\"conceptually overbroad.\\" A program can have multiple functions and thus many ideas. As an alternate metric, the court presented a three-step test to determine substantial similarity, abstraction-filtration-comparison. This process is based on other previously established copyright principles of merger, scenes a faire, and the public domain. In this test, the court must first determine the allegedly infringed program's constituent structural parts. Then, the parts are filtered to extract any non-protected elements. Non-protected elements include: elements made for efficiency (i.e. elements with a limited number of ways it can be expressed and thus incidental to the idea), elements dictated by external factors (i.e. standard techniques), and design elements taken from the public domain. Any of these non-protected elements are thrown out and the remaining elements are compared with the allegedly infringing program's elements to determine substantial similarity. Given the rapidly developing nature of technology, the court recommended a modification of the three-step test where appropriate. They also recommended that the allegedly infringed program be put through the three-step test and then compared to the allegedly infringing program, instead of the reverse as the district court originally chose. == Decision == The court reexamined the district court's process and found no significant fault with it. After taking out all functional elements and elements from the public domain, only a few lists and macros in OSCAR 3.5 were similar to ADAPTER, and their impact on the program was not large enough to declare copyright infringement. The court found that the similarity in services required by the operating system was due to the nature of the operating system, thus it was not protected by copyright. Similarly, the flow charts were found to be an element dictated by external factors flowing from the nature of the work, also unprotectable by copyright law. In light of this analysis, the court upheld the district courts finding that there was no copyright infringement by OSCAR 3.5. > With respect to code, the district court observed that after the rewrite of > OSCAR 3.4 to OSCAR 3.5, “there remained virtually no lines of code that were > identical to ADAPTER.” Id. at 561. Accordingly, the court found that the > code “present[ed] no similarity at all.” Id. at 562. CA's second argument for the appeal concerned trade secret misappropriation. The district court determined that the allegation of misappropriation was based on Altai's use of the infringing material, therefore the copyright infringement claim preempted the misappropriation claim according to 17 U.S.C. § 301., Preemption with respect to other laws Upon revisiting the matter of trade secret misappropriation, the court found that with Arney's potential breach of confidentiality and Altai's potential liability for improper trade secret acquisition, these extra elements differentiate the trade secret misappropriation claim from the copyright infringement claim. The court vacated the district court's preemption ruling and remanded the case back to the district court. == Reactions == The abstraction-filtration-comparison test has been quickly adopted by the courts. In fact, every court since 1992[-2006] has chosen to use the 3-step filtration test over the Whelan test.Mark A. Lemley, Peter S. Menell, Robert P. Merges, and Pamela Samuelson, Software and Internet Law (3d ed. 2006). Some, however, have criticized the approach and claim that it overly narrows the scope of copyright protection. CA and other large computer companies argue that without broader protection, the test will stifle development and disincentivize programmers from actively designing and improving programs. == See also == *Copyright infringement of software *List of leading legal cases in copyright law *Analytic dissection ==References== ==Further reading== * Pamela Samuelson, Why Copyright Law Excludes Systems and Processes from the Scope of Its Protection, 85 Tex.

Jovicic was born on 4 December 1966 in France of Yugoslavian parents. At the age of two, his family migrated to Australia, where Jovicic became an Australian permanent resident and lived for the next 36 years before being sent to Serbia. In Australia, Jovicic became addicted to heroin and turned to crime. By 2004 his criminal record numbered some 158 criminal convictions, mainly for burglary and theft. In June 2004 his permanent residency was cancelled and he was detained, before being deported to Belgrade, Serbia, at the discretion of the then Australian Immigration Minister Amanda Vanstone. The Australian Government only obtained a 7-day visa for him, which meant he was unable to work, and, since he had not opted for Yugoslavian, specifically Serbian, citizenship within 3 years of turning 21 (which was a precondition to maintain citizenship by any of the six Yugoslavia's constituent republics at the time), the FRY authorities declared him stateless. Jovicic turned up destitute and ill, sleeping rough in freezing temperatures outside the Australian embassy in the Serbian capital, Belgrade, in late November 2005. His case was widely publicised in the Australian media, and there were calls for the Australian Government to reverse its cancellation of Jovicic's permanent residency. Jovicic's legal counsel have stated that he does not speak or understand the Serbian language. Jovicic's father was living in Serbia at the time, but he had his own problems (with alcohol) and his relationship his son was strained, so he was of little help. The Serbian government also does not have a proper welfare system. In March 2006, Senator Amanda Vanstone announced that Jovicic would be given a special purpose visa and allowed to return to Australia. She apparently promised the family through the then Department of Immigration, Multi-culturism and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA) that he would be returned and given an RRV (Resident Return Visa). According to his lawyer and others he was also offered access to the new Reconnecting People Package, which is for the reintegration of those wrongly detained (it would seem that if this package was offered it has since been withdrawn). Jovicic returned to Australia on 9 March 2006, but to no certainty about his status. This state of uncertainty continued for almost a year, until he was granted a two-year special protection visa on 19 February 2007 by Senator Vanstone's successor as Immigration Minister, Kevin Andrews. In February 2008 the new Labor Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Chris Evans, granted a Permanent Resident visa to Jovicic. ==See also== *Cornelia Rau *Vivian Solon *Stefan Nystrom *Australian permanent resident ==References== ==Uncited sources== *http://dailytelegraph.news.com.au/story/0,20281,17349473-5001028,00.html *http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2005/s1515472.htm *http://seven.com.au/news/nationalnews/123924 *http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/bring-jovicic-home- beazley/2005/11/25/1132703346873.html *https://web.archive.org/web/20070930184050/http://news.independent.co.uk/world/australasia/article329213.ece *DPP v Jovicic (2001) *http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200603/s1582773.htm *http://www.smh.com.au/news/miranda-devine/worlds-gone-mad-when-bad-guys-want- compo/2005/12/03/1133422144118.html *https://web.archive.org/web/20060826065132/http://www.alp.org.au/media/0306/dsiimm100.php *Jovicic granted reprieve by Immigration Department *Immigration Media Release Category:1966 births Category:Living people Category:Stateless people Category:Australian people of Serbian descent Category:French emigrants to Australia Category:French people of Serbian descent Category:Australian criminals Category:People deported from Australia ","title":"Robert Jovicic"},{"id":"3236297","text":"Laconicum at Chedworth Roman Villa The laconicum (i.e. Spartan, sc. balneum, bath).

The walls of the laconicum were plastered with marble stucco and painted blue with gold stars. Sometimes, as in the old baths at Pompeii, the laconicum was provided in an apse at one end of the caldarium, but as a rule it was a separate room raised to a higher temperature and had no bath in it.

According to the World Trade Organization (WTO), \\"market access for goods in the WTO means the conditions, tariff and non- tariff measures, agreed by members for the entry of specific goods into their markets.\\" Gaining market access is an indispensable step towards deepening trade relations. However, market access is not synonymous with free trade because the possibility to enter a foreign market is in most cases conditioned by certain requirements, whereas free trade implies a perfect state in which goods and services can be circulated across borders without such barriers. Indeed, tackling market access restrictions proves to be a more achievable goal for trade negotiations as compared to free trade. Market access concessions and limitations to market access differ greatly between trade in goods and trade in services. While market access for goods mainly involves measures at the border such as customs duties or quantitative restrictions, market access for services relates more to the application of domestic regulation behind the border. Moreover, in a world of proliferating regionalism, preferential market access for goods and services also have distinctive characteristics from non-preferential market access within the multilateral trading system. == Market Access ram in Merchandise Trade == === Market access in the multilateral trading system === Market access for goods imported into the market of a WTO Member may be impeded or restricted in various ways. The most common barriers to market access are customs duties, quantitative restrictions, technical requirements, lack of transparency of national trade regulation, unfair application of customs formalities and procedures. Considering their diversity, there must be different rules to regulate these tariff and non-tariff barriers to market access. WTO law provides three main groups of rules on market access: rules governing customs duties (tariffs), rules governing quantitative restrictions (quotas), and rules governing other non-tariff barriers such as technical regulations and standards, sanitary and phytosanitary measures, customs formalities and government procurement practices. In addition, rules concerning transparency and “justiciability” are also included to ensure effective market access. Customs duties The imposition of customs duties on imported goods is not prohibited under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), but the later encourages WTO Members to gradually reduce customs duties for mutual benefit. Prior to a country's accession to the WTO, it must negotiate with existing Members on tariff bindings, which will be listed later in its Schedule of Concessions. According to Article II:1 of the GATT, whenever a tariff binding exists for a certain product, the customs duties applied to such product must not exceed the level at which they were bound. Quantitative restrictions While customs duties are in principle not prohibited as long as they do not exceed the bound rates, quantitative restrictions on trade in goods are generally forbidden. According to Article XI:1 of the GATT, unless there is an exception, WTO Members are not allowed to ban the importation or exportation of goods or to subject them to quotas. Non-Tariff Barriers Nowadays, for many products and many countries, non-tariff barriers to trade, such as technical regulations and standards, sanitary and phytosanitary measures, customs formalities and government procurement practices are becoming more important than customs duties or quantitative restrictions. Rules on non-tariff barriers are set out in a number of GATT provisions (e.g., Article VIII on Fees and Formalities Connected with Importation and Exportation) and several specific WTO agreements, particularly the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (the “TBT Agreement”) and the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (the “SPS Agreement”). TBT and SPS agreements basically prohibit measures which discriminate between “like” imported and domestic products. In addition, the TBT Agreement also requires that technical regulations are not more trade-restrictive than necessary to fulfill one of the legitimate policy objectives mentioned in the Agreement. Whereas, the SPS Agreement requires that sanitary and phytosanitary measures are in line with scientific principles, and there must be sufficient scientific evidence to apply these measures except when these measures are maintained provisionally. Transparency and justiciability The requirement that Members shall publish all trade laws, regulations and judicial decisions in order to allow governments and traders to have access to and become acquainted with them is crucial to ensure effective entry to foreign markets. Likewise, the obligation on Members to maintain or establish judicial, arbitral or administrative tribunals in favor of a prompt, objective and impartial review of administrative decisions affecting trade is also essential to guarantee security and predictability of market access. These obligations are contained in several GATT provisions (such as Article X on Publication and Administration of Trade Regulations). Recently, the Agreement on Trade Facilitation has been concluded in order to clarify and make these obligations become more enforceable. === Preferential market access === Preferential market access refers to the fact market opening commitments that go beyond the WTO obligations, either because the exporting country of origin has an agreement to establish a free-trade area (FTA) with the importing country, or because the latter has accorded them special treatment by virtue of the former’s low level of development and/or due to its adoption of certain policies to embrace sustainable development. The formation of free-trade areas is considered an exception to the most favored nation (MFN) principle in the WTO because the preferences that parties to an FTA exclusively grant each other go beyond their accession commitments. Although Article XXIV of the GATT allows WTO Members to establish FTAs or to adopt interim agreements necessary for the establishment thereof, there are several conditions with respect to free-trade areas, or interim agreements leading to the formation of FTAs. According to Article XXIV:8(b) of the GATT, “a free-trade area shall be understood to mean a group of two or more customs territories in which the duties and other restrictive regulations of commerce (except, where necessary, those permitted under Articles XI, XII, XIII, XIV, XV and XX) are eliminated on substantially all the trade between the constituent territories in products originating in such territories.” The Decision on Differential and More Favorable Treatment, Reciprocity and Fuller Participation of Developing Countries adopted by signatories to the GATT in 1979 (the “Enabling Clause”) allows derogation to the MFN treatment in favor of developing and least developed countries (LDCs). It is the WTO’s legal basis for the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). Particularly, merchandise exports from LDCs benefit from duty-free, quota-free market access, and from more favorable rules of origin. In order to gain preferential market access under these preferential trade arrangements, goods must satisfy applicable rules of origin and obtain proofs of origin to indicate that they are originating in an FTA partner country, or from a GSP beneficiary country. If imported goods fail to comply with origin requirements, benefit will be denied, and the goods will have to enter the importing market under non-preferential basis. == Market Access in Services Trade == Market access for services is by nature more complicated than that for goods. In the realm of merchandise trade, market access basically concerns the reduction of border measures as goods enter a foreign market. Whereas, in services trade, market access involves \\"reducing government policy interventions which are less visible and may be applied after a service supplier has entered the market.\\" These measures often take the form of regulations directed at domestic policy objectives rather than external trade policy objectives. Governments usually have little consideration of the impacts of such interventions on market access for foreign services and service suppliers. Within the WTO framework, the concept on market access for services and services suppliers is provided for by Article XVI of the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS): > Article XVI: Market Access 1\\\\. With respect to market access through the > modes of supply identified in Article I, each Member shall accord services > and service suppliers of any other Member treatment no less favorable than > that provided for under the terms, limitations and conditions agreed and > specified in its Schedule 2\\\\. In sectors where market-access commitments are > undertaken, the measures which a Member shall not maintain or adopt either > on the basis of a regional subdivision or on the basis of its entire > territory, unless otherwise specified in its Schedule, are defined as: (a) > limitations on the number of service suppliers whether in the form of > numerical quotas, monopolies, exclusive service suppliers or the > requirements of an economic needs test; (b) limitations on the total value > of service transactions or assets in the form of numerical quotas or the > requirement of an economic needs test; (c) limitations on the total number > of service operations or on the total quantity of service output expressed > in terms of designated numerical units in the form of quotas or the > requirement of an economic needs test; (d) limitations on the total number > of natural persons that may be employed in a particular service sector or > that a service supplier may employ and who are necessary for, and directly > related to, the supply of a specific service in the form of numerical quotas > or the requirement of an economic needs test; (e) measures which restrict or > require specific types of legal entity or joint venture through which a > service supplier may supply a service; and (f) limitations on the > participation of foreign capital in terms of maximum percentage limit on > foreign shareholding or the total value of individual or aggregate foreign > investment. When a WTO Member undertakes any commitment in a service sector or sub-sector, it is obliged to specify for each of the modes of supply (cross-border supply, consumption abroad, commercial presence, and presence of natural persons) what restrictions it opts to maintain regarding market access. All market access restrictions specified in a Member's Schedule of Commitments must fall into one of the six categories provided for in GATS Article XVI:2, which include four types of quantitative restriction, limitations on types of legal entity, and limitations on foreign equity participation. A Member is not allowed to adopt or maintain limitations falling within one of these categories unless they are indicated in its Schedule. Similar to preferential market access in the field of merchandise trade, preferential liberalization of trade in services is also an objective of FTAs. Indeed, enhanced liberalization of services trade besides merchandise trade has become a significant feature of new generation FTAs. (Indeed, the term free-trade area is originally meant by the GATT to exclusively cover trade in goods. An agreement with a similar purpose, i.e., to enhance liberalization of trade in services, is named by GATS Article V as an \\"economic integration agreement\\". However, in practice, the term is now widely used to refer to agreements covering not only goods but also services and even investment.) Commitments going beyond GATS (or GATS- plus) have become a distinctive characteristic of regionalism in services trade. Evidence from recent research proves that in all market access areas, FTAs in general offer \\"value added\\" as compared to the GATS. Despite modest improvement in Mode 4, in almost all modes of supply and sectors, FTA commitments are found to go remarkably beyond GATS offers in terms of both deepened bindings and new bindings. However, most RTAs do not surpass the GATS as it comes to securing the \\"rule-making interface\\" between domestic regulation and trade in services, as well as to special and differential treatment for LDCs. RTA commitments are also inclined to lag behind GATS offers (known as GATS-minus) with regard to safeguard mechanism and disciplines on subsidies. In general, exploiting market access for a service sector, similar to trade in goods, requires identification of the relative strength or comparative advantage of that sector, in order to specialize in the production and export of those services. At the same time, it will require the identification of restrictions in foreign markets and skillful negotiations towards reducing and removing them so as to maximize their export revenues. == Market Access in Healthcare == Market access in health care can be defined as the set of strategies, activities, and processes that pharmaceutical (pharma) and medical technology (MedTech) companies develop to ensure that their products (drugs, devices, other technologies) are made available and adequately priced in a specific health system. == Market Access Tools == ITC's Market Access Map enables users to analyse market access conditions applied all over the world. Market Access Map Market Access Map is a versatile tool which provides information on applied customs tariffs including MFN tariffs and preferences granted unilaterally and reciprocally in the framework of regional and bilateral trade agreements. Users can find ad valorem equivalents (AVEs) for non-ad valorem duties in order to compare tariffs across countries and simulate tariff reduction scenarios. The application also covers tariff rate quotas, trade remedies, rules of origin as well as corresponding documentation, bound tariffs of WTO members, non-tariff measures (NTMs) and trade flows to help users prioritize and analyse export markets as well as prepare for market access negotiations. Rules of Origin Facilitator The Rules of Origin Facilitator helps users to qualify to origin requirements to gain market access to destination markets The Rules of Origin Facilitator provides free and user-friendly access to ITC’s database of rules of origin and origin-related documentation in hundreds of trade agreements. The Facilitator is also combined with the huge tariff and trade agreements databases underlying the Market Access Map, resulting in a unique market intelligence solution enabling companies, particularly ones from developing countries, to benefit from trade agreements worldwide. The Facilitator currently contains a data for more than 250 FTAs applied by more than 190 countries. This database is gradually expanding with the ultimate goal to cover over 400 FTAs and preferential schemes that are currently active in the world. The Facilitator aims to help small and medium sized enterprises to increase trade by taking advantage of global trade opportunities in the form of low duty rates under trade agreements. The tool can also be used by policymakers, trade negotiators, economists as well as various other users. Any user can simply look for information on origin criteria, other origin provisions, and trade documentation by entering the HS code of their product. Tariff Analysis Online Tariff Analysis Online is a facility developed by the WTO to assist researching and analyzing tariff data maintained in two WTO databases: the Integrated Database (IDB, containing general information on applied tariffs and imports), and Consolidated Tariff Schedules (CTS, including members’ binding commitments on maximum tariffs). The information in this facility has been made available to the public since February 2010, following a decision of the Market Access Committee which allowed public access to the two databases. I-TIP Services I-TIP Services is a joint initiative of the WTO and the World Bank (WB). It combines a set of linked databases that provide information on Members' commitments under the GATS, and preferential services commitments in FTAs, together with information on applied measures in services, and statistics on services trade. ==Other useful databases and information portals on Market Access== * WTO's Gateway on Market Access for Goods, a comprehensive portal providing information and documents on MFN market access for goods. *UNCTAD, ITC, WTO, WB and other partners' TRAINS, a global database on Non-Tariff Measures based on official regulations. * ITC's Non-Tariff Measures Business Survey, a database including regulatory and procedural obstacles that trading companies face both at home and abroad. * ITC's Standards Map, a portal covering more than 230 standards initiatives applicable to more than 80 sectors and 180 countries. *EU's Market Access Database , a portal equipping EU exporters with information about import conditions in third country markets. * US' International Trade Administration, a practical business tool helping US traders to export, connect with foreign buyers, and expand operations in new markets. == References == Category:International trade ","title":"Market access"},{"id":"3236322","text":"Timothy Agoglia Carey (March 11, 1929 – May 11, 1994) was an American film and television character actor. Carey was best known for portraying manic or violent characters who are driven to extremes. ==Career== He made his screen debut with a minor role in Billy Wilder's 1951 movie The Big Carnival (alternately titled Ace in the Hole). One of Carey's most recognized early roles was in the 1956 Stanley Kubrick film The Killing, in which he portrayed a gunman hired to shoot a racehorse as a diversion from a racetrack robbery. Kubrick then cast him in his next film, the World War I drama Paths of Glory (1957), as one of three soldiers accused of cowardice. During the filming of Paths of Glory, Carey was reportedly disruptive and tried to draw more attention to his character. Due to this behavior, a scene in which Carey and the other actors were served a duck dinner as a final meal before execution took 57 takes to complete. Carey then faked his own kidnapping to generate personal publicity, which prompted Kubrick and producer James B. Harris to fire him. As a result, the film does not depict the three condemned soldiers during the battle scene, and a double was used during a scene in which a priest hears Carey's character's confession. The scene was filmed with the double's back to the camera.Interview with Producer James B. Harris on the Criterion Collection home video release of Paths Of Glory'\\". The 1957 film Bayou (later retitled Poor White Trash) featured one of Carey's few leading roles, as a demented Cajun shopkeeper named Ulysses. Carey had roles in East of Eden, The Wild One, One-Eyed Jacks, The Boy and the Pirates, Bikini Beach, Beach Blanket Bingo and in the John Cassavetes-directed films Minnie and Moskowitz and The Killing of a Chinese Bookie. Francis Ford Coppola was eager to cast Carey as Luca Brasi in The Godfather, but Carey turned down the part so he could film a television pilot called \\"Tweet’s Ladies of Pasadena\\", which was never sold or broadcast.http://www.absolutefilms.net/tim_carey/FilmFax2004.html The proposed TV show starred Carey as a character named Tweet Twig, who could bring animals back from the dead.https://spectrumculture.com/2013/11/13/criminally- underrated-timothy-carey/ He played a minor role as the Angel of Death in the comedy film D.C. Cab, and appeared in the Monkees self-parody musical comedy Head. His final appearance was in the 1986 movie Echo Park. Carey also did a select amount of acting on television from the 1950s through the 1980s. According to director Quentin Tarantino, Carey auditioned for the role of Joe Cabot in Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs. Although Carey did not get the role, the screenplay was dedicated to him, among others. Carey's face (from the movie The Killing) is positioned behind George Harrison on the cover of The Beatles album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Although Carey's image does not appear on the commercially released version of the cover, it can be seen on outtake photos from the Sgt. Pepper session. In 1971, Mr. Carey appeared as the character Bert in the series 'Columbo' in the Season One Third Episode entitled 'Dead Weight' which also starred Eddie Albert and Suzanne Pleshette. Apparently, Carey was also a favorite actor of Peter Falk. ==The World's Greatest Sinner== Carey wrote, produced, directed, and starred in the 1962 feature The World's Greatest Sinner, whose music soundtrack was scored by a young, pre-Mothers of Invention Frank Zappa. Although it did not have wide commercial release, the film achieved cult status through repeated screenings at the \\"midnight movies\\" in Los Angeles in the 1960s. During a 1963 appearance on The Steve Allen Show during which he generated musical sounds on bicycles, Zappa talked about scoring the soundtrack for The World's Greatest Sinner, which he called \\"the world's worst movie.\\"Zappa appearance on Steve Allen Show, 1963 The movie was featured as a midnight show at the TCM Festival in Hollywood in April 2018. His son Romeo Carey introduced the film. ==Personal life== Carey was born in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn to a family of Italian and Irish descent. He was the nephew of Sylvester Agoglia and Fiore \\"Fury\\" Agoglia, associates of gangster Al Capone. Carey and his wife Doris had six children: Romeo, Mario, Velencia, Silvana, Dagmar and Germain. Carey died of a stroke in 1994 at the age of 65 in Los Angeles.\\"Timothy Carey, 65, A Character Actor,\\" obituary, The New York Times, May 17,1994 His body is interred at Rose Hills Memorial Park in Whittier, California. ==Partial filmography== * Ace in the Hole (a.k.a.

It seems probable, however, that the Via Laurentina proper is that which led out of the Porta Ardeatina of the Aurelian Wall and went direct to Tor Paterno, while the road branching from the Via Ostiensis at the third mile, and leading past Decimo to Lavinium (Pratica), which crosses the other road at right angles not far from its destination (the Laurentina there running SW and that to Lavinium SE) may for convenience be called Lavinatis, though this name does not occur in ancient times. On this latter road, beyond Decimo, two milestones, one of Tiberius, the other of Maxentius, each bearing the number II, have been found; and farther on, at Capocotta, traces of ancient buildings, and an important sepulchral inscription of a Jewish ruler of a synagogue have come to light. That the Via Laurentina was near the Via Ardeatina is clear from the fact that the same contractor was responsible for both roads. Laurentum was also accessible by a branch from the Via Ostiensis at the eighth mile (at Malafede) leading past Castel Porziano, the President of Republic estate, which is identical with the ancient Ager Solonius (in which, Festus tells us, was situated the Pomonal or sacred grove of Pomona) and which later belonged to Gaius Marius. ==The modern road== julian and dalmatian dead soldiers (1961), erected along the Via Laurentina The modern road begins in Rome, in the Ostiense district, separating itself from the consular road Via Ostiense precisely under a railway bridge of the Rome–Lido railway and the Rome Metro B underground: this place, at a short distance from the Basilica di San Paolo fuori le mura, was known since the 16th century as the Ponticello di San Paolo, because of a short bridge now covered by the current road that allowed the crossing of the Via Ostiense on the marrana of Grotta Perfetta, which at a short distance from there discharges into the Tiber. The Via Laurentina, leading towards south, first delimits the border between the districts of Eur (to the west) and Ardeatino and Giuliano-Dalmata (to the east), then between the Fonte Ostiense area and the Giuliano-Dalmata district: it then divides the Vallerano and Castel di Decima areas from the Castel di Leva area. Leaving Rome, at the intersection with the road to Albano, it crosses Santa Procula, a hamlet of Pomezia, then crosses the SS148 state road (via Pontina), which leads to Latina, and finally arrives to Ardea. After Ardea the road ends at the seaside resort of Tor San Lorenzo where it flows into the SS601 state road Ostia-Anzio (via Litoranea). Along the road, at km 14, it lies the Laurentino Cemetery. It contains a portion called the Garden of Angels, dedicated to deceased children and unborn babies.

In mathematics, in the theory of functions of several complex variables, a domain of holomorphy is a set which is maximal in the sense that there exists a holomorphic function on this set which cannot be extended to a bigger set.

This is called the Levi problem (after E. E. Levi) and was first solved by Kiyoshi Oka, and then by Lars Hörmander using methods from functional analysis and partial differential equations (a consequence of \\\\bar{\\\\partial}-problem). == Properties == * If \\\\Omega_1, \\\\dots, \\\\Omega_{n} are domains of holomorphy, then their intersection \\\\Omega = \\\\bigcap_{j=1}^{n} \\\\Omega_j is also a domain of holomorphy. * If \\\\Omega_{1} \\\\subseteq \\\\Omega_{2} \\\\subseteq \\\\dots is an ascending sequence of domains of holomorphy, then their union \\\\Omega = \\\\bigcup_{n=1}^{\\\\infty}\\\\Omega_{n} is also a domain of holomorphy (see Behnke-Stein theorem). * If \\\\Omega_{1} and \\\\Omega_{2} are domains of holomorphy, then \\\\Omega_{1} \\\\times \\\\Omega_{2} is a domain of holomorphy. * The first Cousin problem is always solvable in a domain of holomorphy; this is also true, with additional topological assumptions, for the second Cousin problem. ==See also== * Behnke–Stein theorem * Levi pseudoconvex * solution of the Levi problem * Stein manifold == References == * Steven G.

Opened in 1981, the Westmorland Street Bridge is an extension of Westmorland Street in Fredericton's central business district and connects with Route 105 (or the Ring Road) in Nashwaaksis, a neighbourhood of Fredericton since municipal amalgamation in the 1970s. Westmorland Street Bridge ==Structure== The bridge is a continuous steel girder structure with concrete sidewalls measuring long and carrying four traffic lanes with a posted speed limit of 70 km/h (43.5 mph). There is a pedestrian/bicycle pathway on the north side of the vehicle lanes. ==Access roads== Due to the propensity of spring freshets on the Saint John River, a large part of the floodplain is preserved as open space free from development on both sides of the bridge; part of this open space is taken up by the bridge approach roads - the south side of the easterly-flowing river hosts Pointe- Sainte-Anne Boulevard (occasionally called Riverfront Drive), whereas the north side hosts Devonshire Drive. Pointe-Sainte-Anne was the historic Acadian name for Fredericton as this \\"point\\" in the river was the location of a former village opposite Fort Nashwaak, hence the French name for the street passing over this territory. These road were constructed at the same time as the Westmorland Street Bridge and are accessed via modified cloverleaf interchanges. The final element of the Westmorland Street Bridge was completed on 5 September 2008 when the northeast exit ramp from the bridge for eastbound traffic on Devonshire Drive was opened. This ramp was part of the original design for the bridge but was not built in the 1970s as a result of budget cuts. The idea of completing the missing ramp was periodically resurrected by municipal politicians over a period of 25 years until construction finally began in 2007. Until that time, a temporary connection was used to connect the eastbound lanes of Union Street (which parallels Devonshire Drive). ==History== Considerable public debate preceded construction of the Westmorland Street Bridge in both municipal and provincial politics. Prior to late 1950s, Fredericton had a single bridge crossing the Saint John River. The Carleton Street Bridge was constructed in 1905 as an extension of Carleton Street on the south side to Bridge Street (now Cliffe Street) on the east bank (or north side). Later, in 1959, the Princess Margaret Bridge was opened as part of the construction of the Route 2 (the Trans-Canada Highway) bypass project around the city. In 1968, construction of the Mactaquac Dam 15 kilometres upriver from Fredericton closed the river to navigable traffic above the city. That same year saw residents and government officials begin to discuss a replacement for the Carleton Street Bridge, now that the costly navigation requirement was eliminated. By the early 1970s, the provincial government (the project's primary proponent) settled on an ambitious traffic planning scheme which would see a single new low profile bridge constructed from the foot of Westmorland Street with appropriate collector roads along the waterfront floodplain. This plan elicited various protests by residents and the so-called Citizens' Bridge Committee was founded in May 1974 to urge the provincial government to find an alternative location for the proposed bridge. Issues cited included the location, size and cost of the crossing. The Westmorland Street location was controversial as it and the collector roads would have a major impact on the city's historic riverfront. The Fredericton chapter of the New Brunswick Conservation Council and the Fredericton Heritage Trust were among several organizations which also sought changes to the proposed bridge location and design. The specific objectives of the Citizens' Bridge Committee included: citizen participation in the decisions relating to bridge and highway construction, to develop public awareness of the problem, to coordinate public input, and to articulate community concerns. The committee sought expert opinions on bridge and highway matters, made news releases, provided speakers to groups and information to the general public, and represented public concerns before governments and government agencies.Citizens' Bridge Committee (Fredericton, N.B.) fonds (1968-1977), UNB Archives, 2001 The committee dissolved in September 1975, having decided its members had presented their views to the public and the project had been given a lower priority by the government of Premier Richard Hatfield. In January 1977 a new committee was formed, called Save Our City, in response to renewed efforts by the provincial government to proceed with a replacement for the Carleton Bridge. This committee included representatives from the York-Sunbury Historical Society, the New Brunswick Conservation Council, the University Women's Club, Fredericton Heritage Trust, the Community Planning Association of Canada, various neighbourhood associations, and some members from the Citizen's Bridge Committee. The aim of this new committee was to \\"open the eyes and ears of civil servants and politicians who have persisted in ignoring the substantial opposition to the Westmorland Street bridge proposal.\\" Construction of the Westmorland Street Bridge began in the late 1970s and required both swing spans on the Fredericton Railway Bridge and the Carleton Street Bridge be opened for tugboats and barges needed during the project. This would be the last time the railway bridge swing span was ever opened. Following the completion of the Westmorland Street Bridge in 1982, the steel truss spans of the Carleton Bridge were dismantled; the bridge's piers remain in place across the river with 2 shore-bound piers on the south side being used to carry a short pedestrian bridge across Pointe-Sainte-Anne Boulevard. Another pier (second from the south side shore) became the location of a fountain, called the \\"Silver Spire of Inspiration\\", constructed in 2001 to honour New Brunswick athletes who participated in the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, including Fredericton swimmer Marianne Limpert. Other than the summer of 2003, the fountain has only worked sporadically, but elements of it may find a new home at the Grant-Harvey Arena complex, scheduled to open in 2011. ==References== Category:Road bridges in New Brunswick Category:Buildings and structures in Fredericton Category:Transport in Fredericton Category:Bridges over the Saint John River (Bay of Fundy) Category:Bridges completed in 1982 Category:1982 establishments in New Brunswick Category:Steel bridges in Canada ","title":"Westmorland Street Bridge"},{"id":"3236421","text":"The Fourth Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organization, also known as the WTO Fourth Ministerial Conference, was held at the Sheraton Doha Hotel and Resort, Doha, Qatar from November 9–13, 2001. At this conference, ministers from all WTO members launched the Doha Development Agenda. At the 2001 conference, trade ministers agreed to undertake a brand new round of multilateral trade negotiations and services The ministers passed two declarations. The first, the main declaration folded the ongoing negotiations in agriculture and services into a broader agenda, which is commonly known as the Doha Development Round. In addition. the Doha agenda included the topic of industrial tariffs, topics of interest to developing countries, changes to WTO rules, and other provisions. The second declaration dealt with the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) and allow government to be flexible of TRIPS to deal with health problems. The meeting took place just two months after the World Trade Center attack. As a result, some government officials called for greater political cohesion and saw the trade negotiations as a means toward that end. Some officials thought that a new round of multilateral trade negotiations could help a world economy weakened by recession and terrorism-related uncertainty. == Ministerial Declaration == The Doha Ministerial Declaration mandate for agriculture calls for comprehensive negotiations aimed at substantial improvements in market access; reductions of, with a view to phasing out, all forms of export subsidies; and substantial reductions in trade-distorting domestic support. These topics — domestic support, export subsidies, and market access — have become known as the three pillars of the agricultural negotiations. The Declaration also provides that special and differential treatment for developing countries would be an integral part of all elements of the negotiations. The Declaration took note of non-trade concerns reflected in negotiating proposals of various member countries and confirmed that they would be taken into account in the negotiations. March 31, 2003 was set as the deadline for reaching agreement on “modalities” (targets, formulas, timetables, etc.) for achieving the mandated objectives, but that deadline was missed. During the rest of 2003, negotiations on modalities continued in preparation for the fifth WTO Ministerial Conference held in Cancun, Mexico September 10–14, 2003. ==Intellectual property declaration== The Doha Declaration on Public Health sought to alleviate developing country dissatisfaction with aspects of the TRIPS regime. It delayed the implementation of patent system provisions for pharmaceutical products for least developed countries (LDCs) until 2016. The declaration committed member states to interpret and implement the agreement to support public health and to promote access to medicines for all. The Declaration recognized certain “flexibilities” in the TRIPS agreement to allow each member to grant compulsory licenses for pharmaceuticals and to determine what constitutes a national emergency, expressly including public health emergencies such as HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis or other epidemics. ==China's accession to the WTO== The conference also approved the accession of China to the WTO on November 10. ==References== ==See also== * Doha Declaration Category:World Trade Organization ministerial conferences Category:Diplomatic conferences in Qatar Category:21st-century diplomatic conferences Category:2001 in international relations Category:21st century in Doha Category:2001 in Qatar Category:November 2001 events ","title":"World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 2001"},{"id":"3236422","text":"Aarhus Theatre The Aarhus Theatre (Danish: Aarhus Teater) in Aarhus, is the largest provincial theatre in Denmark.

Published 5 November 2013. Retrieved 6 November 2013. ==Background and early career== Waterhouse is the daughter of Valerie and Tommy J. Smith , a leading trainer of thoroughbred racehorses, who was based in Sydney. She was educated at the Convent of the Sacred Heart, Rose Bay (now Kincoppal-Rose Bay) in Sydney, and completed a Bachelor of Arts at the University of New South Wales in 1975. Waterhouse made a name for herself as a model and actor, including in the Australian drama The Young Doctors before moving to England and appearing in the Doctor Who story The Invasion of Time. She then returned to Australia where she served an apprenticeship under her father for fifteen years before getting her own trainer's licence. ==Training career== Waterhouse was granted her Australian Jockey Club (AJC) licence in January 1992, although this was made difficult as her husband, Robbie Waterhouse, was banned over his involvement in the Fine Cotton scandal. AJC rules at the time stipulated that the spouse of a banned person could not be licensed, although this was subsequently overturned. Her first winner was the horse Gifted Poet in March 1992, and her first Group One winner was Te Akau Nick in the Metropolitan Handicap in October that year. After her father, T. J. Smith became ill, he passed on the Tulloch Lodge stable to her in the 1994–95 season. Waterhouse first achieved fame in Australia when Nothin' Leica Dane came into the Melbourne Cup in 1995 after winning the Victoria Derby three days earlier. The three-year-old colt ran second in the Melbourne Cup, a race which no three- year-old had won since Skipton in 1941. During the 1996–97 season, she had ten Group One wins and won her first Sydney premiership. In 2001, Waterhouse trained the first, second, and third place-getters in the Golden Slipper and added the first of three successive Sydney training premierships, culminating with 156 wins in 2002/03, equalling her father's Sydney training record. In the 2004–05 racing season, Waterhouse had eleven Group One wins and added a fifth Sydney training premiership. , the Waterhouse stable at Tulloch Lodge had won 102 Group One races. Waterhouse's other successful horses include Golden Slipper winners Dance Hero, Ha Ha and the newly crowned 2008 Golden Slipper winner and Australian two-year-old of the year, Sebring. Prolific Group One winners Grand Armee, Juggler, and All Our Mob as well as two time Epsom Handicap winner Desert War. Waterhouse also won the 2010 BMW Caulfield Cup with Descarado. In the 2012 Caulfield Guineas Waterhouse's hot favourite Pierro, undefeated in his first eight races, was beaten by All Too Hard in a major upset. All Too Hard is the half-brother of star sprinter Black Caviar. In the Caulfield Cup, Waterhouse was dealt yet another blow when favourite Glencadam Gold finished 15th, nine lengths behind last year's Melbourne Cup winner Dunaden. At the 2013 Sydney Cup day, owner John Singleton sacked Waterhouse live on television after her son Tom Waterhouse, a bookmaker, allegedly told acquaintances that Singleton's horse More Joyous would lose the All Ages Stakes, which it did. Both Gai Waterhouse and Tom Waterhouse denied any wrongdoing. Stewards laid two charges against Waterhouse; (1) 'fail to report to the stewards any condition or occurrence that may affect the running of a horse in a race', and (2) 'having failed to keep a record of treatments administered to a horse'. On 27 May, Waterhouse was found guilty and fined A$5500. On 5 November 2013, Waterhouse won her first Melbourne Cup with Fiorente. She is the second female trainer to win the race, and the first Australian woman. ==Awards== sculptor Linda Klarfeld On 30 September 2000, Waterhouse was awarded the Australian Sports Medal for \\"outstanding contribution to thoroughbred racing\\". She is also an Australian Living Treasure nominated by the National Trust of Australia. Waterhouse was inducted into the Australian Racing's Hall of Fame in November 2007, following in the footsteps of her late father, T. J. Smith.

Thieven Stealburg), Big Dubez (a.k.a. Safecracker) and Marlon Bryant Brando (1979–2001; a.k.a. Robin Hood).[ allmusic ((( Sporty Thievz > Biography )))] They are notable for their parody of TLC's hit \\"No Scrubs\\" titled \\"No Pigeons\\", which attempted to tell things from the male perspective, and their song \\"Hit It Up\\" on the soundtrack to The Best Man. They are also known for satirically providing a male counterpoint to the female-oriented R&B; music popularised in the late 1990s and early 2000s, something that was not done by any other group at the time. The group have been acknowledged for their lyrical skill, also making other notable hits such as \\"Cheapskate\\", which also has a music video and was released under Ruffhouse Records In 1998, their album Street Cinema was released on Roc-A- Bloc/Ruffhouse Records. The majority of the production was handled by Ski, famous for his work on Jay-Z's Reasonable Doubt. It had a unique concept in which every track had its own storyline that could also serve as a premise for a movie. This concept would reprise a decade later on rapper Ludacris's 2008 album, Theater of the Mind. They did not get much airplay until the \\"No Pigeons\\" single was released, which hit #16 in the UK Singles Chart and stayed on that chart for six weeks. Street Cinema was re-released with \\"No Pigeons\\" appearing as a bonus track. In an attempt to capitalize, Sporty Thievz also released a rebuttal to Destiny's Child's hits \\"Bills, Bills, Bills\\" (written by the same songwriter as \\"No Scrubs\\", Kandi Burruss) and \\"Independent Women\\". The \\"Bills Bills Bills\\" rebuttal, entitled \\"Can't Pay Your Bills\\", demands \\"I need a lady working 9-5 to help her man out\\" (not to be confused with the track entitled \\"No Billz (Why, Why, Why?)\\" in which the group \\"humorously\\" questions \\"Why we gotta spend, because we men?\\"). In the \\"Independent Women\\" rebuttal \\"Independent Men\\" they consider the unfairness of child support, stating \\"She won't let me see my seed acting like it's funny, She gettin' her hair done with that diaper money\\". The group contributed to the Rawkus Records 2000 compilation Hip Hop for Respect, a project put together by Mos Def and Talib Kweli to put out an EP recording 41 emcees in protest over the 41 shots fired at African immigrant and innocent man, Amadou Diallo, by the NYPD. On May 11, 2001, group member Marlon Bryant Brando was killed after being struck by a car in North Bronx at the age of 22. It is reported that the driver of the car was intoxicated and swerving onto the sidewalk.Marlon Bryant is believed to have saved a bystanding child's life by pushing him out of the way. In 2013, King Kirk released his new Sporty Thievz compilation album mixtape called \\"Cinema, Beats & Brawdz\\".

The conversion was carried out in September 1932, and it was found that the aircraft's performance was not degraded by the change of engine, and low-level maneuverability was improved due to the lower mass moment of inertia with the short radial engine. The USAAC preferred radials to inline engines for the ground attack role, due to the vulnerability of the latter's cooling system to anti-aircraft fire. The US Navy also preferred radials for carrier-borne operations.\\"The Illustrated Encyclopedia of the 20th Century Weapons and Warfare\\" Editor: Bernard Fitzsimons (Purnell & Sons Ltd., ) 1967/1969, Vol. 21 Upon completion of testing the Army changed an order for 46 A-8B aircraft to the production version of the YA-10, the A-12 Shrike. ==Operational history== Following completion of testing, the YA-10 was assigned to the 3rd Attack Group for operational service, then in 1934 it was assigned to the Command and General Staff School.

It called for the annexation of British North America and the admission of its provinces as states and territories in the Union. The bill was sent to committee but never came back, was never voted upon, and did not become law. The bill never came to the United States Senate. The bill authorized the President of the United States to, subject to the agreement of the governments of the British provinces, \\"publish by proclamation that, from the date thereof, the States of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Canada East, and Canada West, and the Territories of Selkirk, Saskatchewan, and Columbia, with limits and rights as by the act defined, are constituted and admitted as States and Territories of the United States of America.\\" It provided for the admission of all the colonies and the purchase of the Hudson's Bay Company's lands for $10,000,000. The American government would assume public lands and state-owned bonds and the right to levy taxes and, in return, would take over provincial debts to the total of $85,700,000 and give an annual subsidy of $1,646,000 to the new states. In addition, the United States would connect Canada with the Maritimes by rail and spend $50,000,000 to complete and improve the colonial canal system. The bill was introduced by Congressman Nathaniel Prentice Banks, a representative from Massachusetts. It was intended to appeal to Irish Americans who supported the Fenian Movement and were aggressively hostile to Britain. Indeed, much of American public opinion at the time was hostile because of Britain's perceived support for the Confederacy during the American Civil War. There was no serious effort in Washington to annex Canada. Its introduction and similar interest in annexation by the United States possibly provided a little incentive for the organization of Canada as an entity distinct from Britain; indeed, the bill's introduction preceded Canadian Confederation by less than a year. However the Fenian raids had much more influence in shaping determination to hurry the Confederation process. ==Proposed states and territories== If successful, the Annexation Bill would have created four states and three territories from what is today Canada, listed below.

For most of the last 80 years, the major right-wing party of the day has won all or most of the ridings here, often by astronomical margins. The Conservative Party of Canada kept this tradition going, often winning every riding in this region by some of the largest margins in the nation, making rural Alberta easily the least competitive region in the country. This was always the power base for the former Reform and Canadian Alliance parties from 1993 to 2000, and before then the former Progressive Conservative Party swept every riding here from 1972 to 1993. Social Credit was birthed in rural Alberta, and for many years was either the first or second party in much of the region. Some ridings in this area were previously friendly to Red Tories, but since the 1990s the entire region has turned in a more fiscal and social conservative direction. For example, former prime minister Joe Clark represented the riding of Yellowhead and its predecessor, Rocky Mountain, from 1972 to 1993 during his first tenure in parliament, but ran in (and won) the comparatively less conservative seat of Calgary Centre during his comeback to politics in 2000. Much of this area has not been represented by a centre-left MP in recent memory; for instance, Lethbridge has been represented solely by right-wing MPs since 1930. The Liberals have been completely shut out in rural Alberta since 1972, and have been barely on the radar screen here for most of the time since then. As evidence of the antipathy much of the region has for the Liberals, Jack Horner crossed the floor in 1977 to join the Liberals, only to be soundly defeated when he ran for reelection in Crowfoot as a Liberal in 1979, losing almost three-fourths of his vote from 1974. He was also resoundingly defeated when he tried to regain the riding in 1980. In recent elections the Liberals have drawn their lowest percentage of votes ever; they are usually lucky to draw more than 20 percent of the vote, and in some ridings (Crowfoot and Yellowhead) they have attracted less than three percent. The New Democratic Party has also had poor results. In fact, the Green Party finished second ahead of the NDP in the Wild Rose riding in 2006. The NDP surged in 2011 across Alberta, including Wilrose. In 2011 the NDP finished second in all of the rural Alberta ridings. As a measure of how deeply conservative rural Alberta is, the Conservatives held their own in 2015 even as they were heavily defeated nationally. They took every riding with 60 percent or more of the vote, with centre-left parties only managing to crack the 20 percent mark in three ridings. However, support for the Conservatives was not universal; in all but three ridings, the NDP and Liberals together did crack the 20 percent mark, sometimes reaching past 30 percent. ==2015 - 42nd General Election== ==2011 - 41st General Election== ==2008 - 40th General Election== ==2006 - 39th General Election== ==2004 - 38th General Election== Key map #Fort McMurray-Athabasca #Crowfoot #Lethbridge #Macleod #Medicine Hat #Peace River #Red Deer #Vegreville-Wainwright #Westlock-St. Paul #Wetaskiwin #Wild Rose #Yellowhead Image:racpc.PNGConservative Party of Canada Image:ragpc.PNGGreen Party of Canada Image:ralpc.PNGLiberal Party of Canada Image:randp.PNGNew Democratic Party ==2000 - 37th General Election== Category:Politics of Alberta Rural ","title":"Canadian federal election results in rural Alberta"},{"id":"3236466","text":"285x285px 255x255px 235x235px The Princess Margaret Bridge, sometimes called the Princess Margaret Rose Bridge or shortened to just PMB, is a two-lane highway bridge crossing the Saint John River at Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada. It is named after Queen Elizabeth II's sister Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon. Constructed as a steel truss structure, the bridge measures in length and has a navigation clearance of in the centre. It opened in 1959 as part of the Route 2 Trans-Canada Highway bypass project around Fredericton. Following a realignment of Route 2 in 2001, the bridge now carries Route 8, the primary Fredericton-Miramichi highway. The northern approach follows the old Trans-Canada Highway alignment toward Barker's Point (now designated Route 105), but travellers wanting to continue on Route 8 must exit on a ramp immediately after leaving the bridge, while maintaining another sharp turning radius to pass back under the roadway and follow the Route 8 alignment to Marysville. This interchange is envisioned to be replaced by a straightened alignment of Route 8 onto the Marysville Bypass with a newly designed interchange with Route 105. During the summer of 2010, and again in the summer of 2011, the bridge was closed for extensive repairs to the deck, concrete piers, and steel structure. The province of New Brunswick is investing $80 million for the repairs, which when complete will extend its life for another 50 years. ==Controversy== Safety concerns have precipitated many construction projects on the bridge in the 1980s and 1990s, due in part to the narrow width of the roadway and to high traffic volume. The bridge deck is prone to severe icing conditions in winter, leading to motor vehicle accidents. The bridge's narrow, two-lane span poses a hazard for motorists travelling at speeds over the posted speed limit of 70 km/h (45 mph). The approaches to the bridge on both sides are also of concern: The southern approach descends a steep grade while transiting from a four-lane divided freeway to two-lane suburban/rural arterial road. Pedestrians from a St. Thomas University residence on the east side of the bridge frequently take a shortcut at grade across the highway up the hill from the bridge to follow the contour of the hill while en route to the university's main campus. The southern approach also contains an interchange with Forest Hill Road with very tight turning radius on exit and entrance ramps. Northbound travellers must negotiate a sharp incline and a 30-degree turning radius to access the bridge. On three occasions, tractor trailers have failed to negotiate the turn, instead crashing through the guard rail and either dangling over the edge or falling into the river entirely. In early May 2009, concerns were raised after a 10-kilogram chunk of concrete fell from the bridge onto the roadway underneath, narrowly missing a passing motorist's vehicle. The bridge underwent a major refurbishment in the years that followed. ==References== * Category:Road bridges in New Brunswick Category:Buildings and structures in Fredericton Category:Transport in Fredericton Category:Truss bridges in Canada Category:Bridges over the Saint John River (Bay of Fundy) Category:Bridges completed in 1959 Category:Steel bridges ","title":"Princess Margaret Bridge"},{"id":"3236480","text":"Tigress is the name of three different comic book supervillains, all of whom have appeared in various series published by DC Comics. In live action, Tigress debuted as original character Tabitha Galavan starting in the second season of the series Gotham, played by Jessica Lucas. Paula Brooks‘ version of Tigress appears on the DC Universe streaming service show Stargirl played by Joy Osmanski. The show also appears on The CW Network. ==Publication history== The first Golden Age Tigress was a thief/spy and foe of Zatara in the late 1930s. She debuted in Action Comics #1 (June 1938), and was created by Fred Guardineer. She wore tiger-striped sweaters and ran gangs of thieves and murderers. She apparently had no powers. The second Tigress is Paula Brooks, who was a member of the Young All-Stars, who later became a villainess named the Huntress. The third Tigress is Artemis Crock, the daughter of the second Tigress, and is a member of the Injustice Society. She debuted in Infinity Inc. #34 and was created by Roy Thomas and Todd McFarlane. ==Fictional character biography== ===Zatara foe=== The original Golden Age Tigress. The original Tigress appeared as Zatara's primary foe throughout twelve issues of Action Comics, including issues 1, 3, 6, 7, 9, 10, 22, 23, 25, 30, 35 and 42. In her initial appearance, she battles Zatara and his assistant Tong while attempting to rob a freight train. She escapes and later resurfaces in stories using various methods in attempts to kill wealthy men, including using an attacking airplane, poisoning their drinks and infecting them with a disease from a rare South American insect. She also uses her influence as a mob boss to pressure other criminals into assisting her in crime sprees, which usually involve bank robberies and thefts of other valuables. The Artemis entry in Who's Who Update '87 #1 states that the Golden Age Tigress is the mother of Paula Brooks (the second Tigress and original Huntress) and the grandmother of Artemis Crock (the third Tigress). However, Who's Who Update '87 #5 included a retraction of that information and stated that neither Paula Brooks nor Artemis Crock is related to her. ===Paula Brooks=== The second Tigress is Paula Brooks. She was a member of the Young All-Stars and later became the villainous Huntress. She later married the Sportsmaster, and had a daughter, Artemis Crock, who becomes the third Tigress. ===Artemis Crock=== Artemis Crock is the daughter of the Golden Age villains Paula Brooks and Crusher Crock. She had taken up a career in crime, modeled after that of her parents, but only after some years did she take on the mantle of Tigress. ==Other versions== ===Tigress (Earth-S)=== An unknown woman nicknamed Tigress appears in Spy Smasher #2 (December, 1941). This version is an enemy of Spy Smasher. ===Tigress (Quality Universe)=== An unknown woman dubbed The Tigress or Tiger Lady appears in Blackhawk #11 (June, 1946). She is the leader of a gang of international criminal fugitives, who had fled the civilized world and holed up in a well-hidden fortress, in a jungle, in a mountainous, tropical part of the world. She organized this rabble into a tiger-masked team of deadly spearmen, mainly in order to keep the local natives at bay. A chance encounter with the Blackhawk Squadron, and a few bad decisions on her part, led to the Tigress' being killed by arrow-shooting natives, and her thugs being killed by the pistol-packing Blackhawks. ==In other media== ===Animation=== * A drastically different Tigress appears in the Batman Beyond episode \\"Splicers\\", voiced by Cree Summer. This version of the character is a human spliced with tiger DNA by a villainous genetics expert named Dr. Abel Cuvier. ===Live- action=== * A different kind of Tigress appears since the second season of Gotham portrayed by Jessica Lucas. This version of the character, an original creation for the series, is named Tabitha Galavan, sister and lead enforcer of corrupt billionaire Theo Galavan. They are both members of the Sacred Order of Saint Dumas, an ancient secret society bent on taking over Gotham City. She kidnaps Oswald Cobblepot's (Robin Lord Taylor) mother Gertrud (Carol Kane) to force him to kill the other mayoral candidates; after Cobblepot does Theo's bidding, however, Tabitha kills her anyway. Tabitha eventually falls out of favor with her brother, and so forms an alliance with Cobblepot's enforcer, Butch Gilzean (Drew Powell). Theo is killed by Cobblepot and detective James Gordon (Benjamin McKenzie), but is eventually revived by Hugo Strange (B.D. Wong) as the warrior Azrael. As Azrael, Theo stabs Tabitha with a sword, critically injuring her. After Theo is killed yet again by Cobblepot and Gilzean, Tabitha recovers and becomes small-time gangster Barbara Kean's (Erin Richards) right-hand woman. She has an uneasy truce with Cobblepot, who is now Mayor of Gotham City. Cobblepot's chief adviser Edward Nygma (Cory Michael Smith) blames Gilzean for the death of his girlfriend Isabella, and so he kidnaps Gilzean and Tabitha and imprisons them in an elaborate torture device that will kill Gilzean unless Tabitha pulls a lever that will sever her hand. After Gilzean declares that he loves her, Tabitha sacrifices her right hand to save him. Gilzean and Kean rush her to a hospital where her hand is reattached. Once Cobblepot falls from power, Tabitha and Barbara take over Gotham. However, when Barbara begins to work with Nygma Tabitha is disappointed. Butch and Tabitha plan to kill her. When Barbara finds out she shoots Butch in the head and fights with Tabitha who manages to electrocute her to death, with her quick whip. Now alone, Tabitha takes up a mentoring role to a young Selina Kyle (Camren Bicondova). When Butch is revived as Solomon Grundy, Tabitha ends up placed against him in an underground fighting ring in The Narrows, where she is dubbed \\"Tabby the Tigress\\" by Nygma. When Kean takes over the League of Shadows, she turns against Tabitha, but the two once again join forces to help Cobblepot stop psychopathic criminal Jeremiah Valeska (Cameron Monaghan) from destroying the city. In return for their help, Cobblepot cures Butch of his condition - only to shoot him dead in front of Tabitha as revenge for Tabitha killing his mother. She swears revenge and joins Barbara's women-only \\"Gotham City Sirens\\" to take over Gotham once and for all, and kill Cobblepot in the workings. Three months later, Tabitha attempts to kill Cobblepot in revenge for Butch, but her use of a defective bullet allows Cobblepot to kill her instead. ==References== ==External links== * Comic Book Database: Tigress I * The Unofficial Tigress I Biography Category:Comics characters introduced in 1938 Category:Comics characters introduced in 1947 Category:Comics characters introduced in 1987 Category:Fictional vigilantes Category:Fictional archers Category:DC Comics martial artists Category:DC Comics female supervillains Category:DC Comics female superheroes Category:DC Comics LGBT supervillains Category:DC Comics television characters Category:Female characters in comics Category:Fictional assassins Category:Fictional gangsters Category:Fictional amputees Category:Fictional victims of kidnapping Category:Fictional LGBT characters in television Category:Characters created by Roy Thomas Category:Characters created by Todd McFarlane ","title":"Tigress (DC Comics)"},{"id":"3236497","text":" The Northrop YA-13 was an attack version of the Northrop Gamma type aircraft. After receiving an engine change, the aircraft was redesignated XA-16. ==Design and development== The Northrop Gamma 2C was a company funded demonstrator based on the Northrop Gamma 2A and 2B designs. These early designs were primarily designed as racers or for speed record attempts. The cockpits both of the 2A and 2B aircraft were far back on the fuselage near the tail, but for the Gamma 2C the cockpit was moved forward to a more conventional position. The Air Corps evaluated the Northrop Gamma 2C attack aircraft in mid 1933. Testing revealed the need for some modifications which were done in the first part of 1934. The aircraft was returned to the Army for testing at Wright Field in the summer of 1934. By this time, the Air Corps purchased the aircraft and designated it YA-13 and assigned it the serial number 34-27. Further testing of the YA-13 revealed the aircraft to be underpowered and the Army recommended the aircraft be fitted with a more powerful engine. The original engine was a large diameter single-row radial engine, which partially obstructed the pilot's forward vision. The replacement engine, a twin-row radial, was more powerful and had a smaller diameter. The propeller was changed from a two-blade to three-blade type also.http://www.joebaugher.com/usattack/a13.html After the engine change was completed, the aircraft was returned to Wright Field for additional testing. The Air Corps followed standard practice and re-designated the aircraft XA-16 based on the engine change. Unfortunately, with the new more powerful engine, the aircraft went from being underpowered to overpowered.http://www.joebaugher.com/usattack/a16.html Northrop was developing another attack aircraft at this time in a more or less parallel development program. This aircraft was initially designated Gamma 2F and was based on an improved Gamma 2C design. This aircraft eventually became the A-17, the primary single engine attack aircraft used by the Army Air Corps during the late 1930s. With the success of the A-17, the YA-13/XA-16 program never progressed past the test phase. ==Variants== ;YA-13 ;XA-16 ==Operators== ; * United States Army Air Corps ==Specifications (XA-16)== Northrop XA-16 ==See also== ==References== A-13, Northrop A-13 Category:Low-wing aircraft Category:Single-engined tractor aircraft Category:Aircraft first flown in 1933 ","title":"Northrop YA-13"},{"id":"3236500","text":"The following is a list of major and notable scholarly journals in international business.

Prior to construction of the first bridge in 1853, ferries were used to connect both sides of the river in the city. The first bridge was a suspension bridge, built by Joseph Tomlinson III, measured 190 m in length. Its replacement, the current steel arch structure or Saint John Highway Arch Bridge (designed by Philip Louis Pratley), was opened to public use alongside the original in 1915. Both structures have shared the site of this crossing with the Reversing Falls Railway Bridge since 1885. It is also known as the floating bridge. Until the 1940s, the Reversing Falls Bridge also carried a streetcar line. Until 1968, with the opening of a second bridge in Saint John, the Harbour Bridge, the Reversing Falls Bridge was the only link between the city's East and West sides.

It is the current base of the provincial NDP. The NDP scored an upset victory in the 2015 provincial election primarily by taking all of Edmonton, and held all but one Edmonton seat even as they were defeated in 2019. However, Edmonton is still more conservative than most other large cities in Canada. The Conservatives and their predecessors have held most seats here since 1993, although in most cases with smaller pluralities than the astronomical margins in rural Alberta. Edmonton is the only part of Alberta where the federal Liberals have consistently broken through in recent times, having won between two and four seats here from 1993 to 2004, although never by large margins. The Liberals lost all their Edmonton seats in 2006 as the Conservatives took power back. The four seats the Liberals won in 1993 were the first they had won anywhere in Alberta since 1968. In 2008, the Conservative sweep of Alberta was broken by the New Democratic Party (NDP) in Edmonton-Strathcona. The NDP has held this seat every election since. Besides retaining Edmonton-Strathcona, in 2011 the NDP finished second in all other Edmonton-area ridings except Edmonton- Sherwood Park (where they came in third behind the Conservative winner and an independent candidate). The only other time the NDP has won a seat in the region was in 1988 when it won Edmonton East. The safest Tory seats are located in the more suburban ridings outside of the city core. From 2004 to 2011, their best riding in the region was Edmonton—Spruce Grove—most of which is now Edmonton West. In 2011, for instance, the Conservatives won 71% of the vote there. They also won more than 60% of the vote in Edmonton—St. Albert, Edmonton—Leduc and Edmonton—Mill Woods—Beaumont. Further underlining this, one of the Liberal gains in 2015 was in Edmonton Centre. In 2015, the Liberals took two ridings, the NDP retained Edmonton Strathcona, and the Tories held the remainder. Edmonton reverted to form in 2019, with the Conservatives taking all but Edmonton Strathcona, which remained in NDP hands as the only non-Tory riding in Alberta. ==2015 - 42nd General Election== ==2011 - 41st General Election== ==2008 - 40th General Election== ==2006 - 39th General Election== ==2004 - 38th General Election== { - Key map  #Edmonton-Mill Woods-Beaumont #Edmonton Centre #Edmonton East #Edmonton-Leduc #Edmonton-St. Albert #Edmonton-Sherwood Park #Edmonton-Spruce Grove #Edmonton-Strathcona - Conservative Party of Canada Green Party of Canada - Liberal Party of Canada New Democratic Party } ==2000 - 37th General Election== Category:Alberta federal electoral districts Category:Politics of Edmonton Edmonton Category:History of Edmonton ","title":"Canadian federal election results in Edmonton and environs"},{"id":"3236513","text":"Marine Park is a neighborhood in the New York City borough of Brooklyn. The neighborhood lies between Flatlands and Mill Basin to the east, and Gerritsen Beach, Midwood, and Sheepshead Bay to the south and west. It is mostly squared off in area by Gerritsen Avenue, Flatbush Avenue, Avenue U and Kings Highway. The neighborhood's eponymous park is the largest public park in Brooklyn.Marine Park, New York City Department of Parks and Recreation. Accessed September 24, 2016. \\"As Brooklyn's largest park, Marine Park has plenty of room to serve a lot of needs. Environmentally, it consists of 530 acres of grassland and precious salt marsh, protected as a Forever Wild preserve.\\" Charles Downing Lay won a silver medal in town planning at the 1936 Olympics for the planning of Marine Park. Marine Park is largely inhabited by ethnic groups such as Italians, Irish, Greeks, and Jews. The area is part of Brooklyn Community Board 18. ==History== The neighborhood is situated around Gerritsen Creek, the westernmost inlet of Jamaica Bay; the creek's path within the neighborhood was covered in 1920. During the last 5,000 years, strips of sand were deposited by ocean currents. These beach strips form a surf-barrier and allow salt marshes to thrive: The area was a hunting and fishing ground for Native Americans from the nearby village of Keshawchqueren. Pits for cooking and preparing food dating from 800 to 1400 AD were uncovered in Marine Park, along with deer and turtle bones, oyster shells, and sturgeon scales. In the 17th century, the Dutch began to settle in the area, which had similarities to the marshland and coastal plains of the Netherlands. The land proved to be fairly good farmland and there was an abundance of clams, oysters, and game from the region as well. One of the oldest houses in the neighborhood is the Hendrick I. Lott House, built in 1720. The house is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is a New York City designated landmark. See also: In the 18th century, George Washington made a stop for several days on the land nearby. There was a gristmill on the water at the time. As early as 1910, developers began dredging ports within Jamaica Bay in an effort to develop a seaport district there. Although the city allowed several piers to be constructed in 1918, only one was built on the former Barren Island. The pier, which was built in order to receive landfill for the other proposed piers, stretched northeast and was wide. In 1931, the city took possession of on the western side of Barren Island. That plot was combined with a tract owned by Kings County to create the park named Marine Park. Urban planner Robert Moses expanded Marine Park in 1935, and the city acquired of land. This comprised the entire island west of Flatbush Avenue. Barren Island's residents were mostly evicted by 1939, and part of the island became part of Marine Park, but much of the rest of the island became Floyd Bennett Field. In 1935, the mill burned down to the water level due to vandals, leaving only wood pilings across the water, which can be clearly seen to this day during low tide. In the mid-20th century the area was abused by trash and abandoned cars. At one point it became a landfill and trash piled up to in certain areas. After a massive cleanup effort in the 1990s the area was restored to its former glory, with exception of a few rusty car parts riddling the area, and teens littering and causing arson to the dry tall Phragmites from time to time. ==Demographics== Marine Park is located in zip code 11234, which also includes Mill Basin, Bergen Beach/Georgetown, and the southern portion of Flatlands. Based on data from the 2010 United States Census, the combined population of Georgetown, Marine Park, Bergen Beach, and Mill Basin was 45,231, an increase of 2,291 (5.3%) from the 42,940 counted in 2000.

At 3 A.M. on Sunday, 1 August 1982, a group of soldiers from the Kenya Air Force took over Eastleigh Air Base just outside Nairobi, and by 4 A.M. the nearby Embakasi air base had also fallen. At 6 A.M. Senior Private Hezekiah Ochuka and Sergeant Pancras Oteyo Okumu captured the Voice of Kenya radio station in central Nairobi, from where they then broadcast in English and Swahili that the military had overthrown the government. Working at the behest of Ochuka, Corporal Bramwel Injeni Njereman was leading a plot to bomb the State House and the General Service Unit headquarters from the Laikipia Air Base, Nanyuki. Corporal Njereman forced three pilots (Major David Mutua, Captain John Mugwanja, and Captain John Baraza) to fly two F-5E Tiger jets and a Strikemaster that would be used for the mission. However, Major Mutua was aware that Corporal Njereman had never flown a jet fighter before and would likely not be able to cope with the g-forces. The pilots, while communicating on a secret channel, agreed to execute daring manoeuvres to disorient their captor. The trick worked. The pilots dumped the bombs in Mt. Kenya forest and headed back to Nanyuki. The coup was strategically planned to coincide with the war games taking place in Lodwar, a remote town in Kenya, when most of the army units and the senior leadership were away from Nairobi. This meant that the senior-most officers present at the time were Lieutenant General John Sawe (the Army Commander and Deputy Chief of the General Staff), Major General Mahmoud Mohamed (Sawe's deputy), Brigadier Bernard Kiilu (Chief of Operations at Defence Headquarters), and Major Humphrey Njoroge (a staff officer in charge of training at Army Headquarters). At a meeting of the four, it was agreed that Mohamed would take charge of the operation to suppress the coup. He then assembled a team of about 30 officers from First Kenya Rifles Battalion and Kahawa barracks. The team stormed the broadcasting station and killed or captured the rebel soldiers inside. , a broadcaster who had earlier been captured by Ochuka to announce the coup went on air to report that the rebels had been defeated and Moi was back in power. With the help of the General Service Unit (GSU) and later the regular police, Mohamed gained control of Nairobi, causing the Air Force rebels to flee. Hezekiah Ochuka, whose rank of Senior Private Grade-I was the second lowest rank in the Kenyan military, claimed to rule Kenya for about six hours, before fleeing to Tanzania. After being extradited back to Kenya, he was tried and found guilty of leading the coup attempt, and was hanged in 1987. Also implicated in the coup attempt were Jaramogi Oginga Odinga, a former vice-president to Jomo Kenyatta (Moi's predecessor), and his son Raila Amolo Odinga. ==The plan== Ochuka had become obsessed with becoming the President of Kenya at one time in his lifetime (he had the words \\"The next president of Kenya\\" carved on his desk), and this led him to quickly accept a proposal by Obuon and Oteyo to overthrow Moi's government. He recruited some of the soldiers at his base at Embakasi, including those who ranked higher than he.Jim Bailey; Garth Bundeh. Kenya: The National Epic. East African Publishers; 1993 [cited 1 August 2012]. GGKEY:EKUEFUF9WH9. p. 269. There was a heated debate amongst the plotters about who would become the chairman of the \\"People Redemption's Council\\" (PRC) that would assume power after the coup. For his part, Obuon claimed that he had recruited the largest number of soldiers into the plan, and so warranted the chairmanship. Obuon also added the fact that he had served as the chairman of the airmen's mess. Ochuka threatened in return that all the soldiers he had recruited to the plot would quit if he was not selected as the PRC's chairman. Obuon and Ochuka had a heated debate that almost broke into a fight over the chairmanship, until Oteyo intervened. Oteyo advised Obuon to leave the chairmanship to Ochuka, whom they could then kill once the coup had succeeded. Ochuka may have suspected the plot of Obuon and Oteyo. He rallied support from soldiers to him as an individual, and he went further to build a protective wall around him. Ochuka also rallied support from Obuon's old political friend and it is believed that the old friend even gave him two million shillings and a second hand car. He had also managed to steal some military communication equipment which he had set up at a private house in Nairobi which was located a few kilometres from the city center. In late July 1982, Ochuka held a secret meeting at football grounds near Umoja estate, at which details of how the coup was to be executed were discussed. Ochuka told the attendees that he had the support of Uganda, Tanzania, and Sudan, who would send their soldiers to the borders to counter any opposition. He went further to allege that he had the blessings of the Soviet Union, which would send a ship to the Kenyan coast to guard against any external interference. Ochuka had made up all these stories to convince his recruits to take up the risk in the mission. Details of the impending coup were known by senior military officials. James Kanyotu, the Directorate of the Kenya Security Intelligence had infiltrated the military and was also aware of the coup plot. After the opening ceremonies of the Nyeri ASK Show on Friday, July 30, Kanyotu asked President Moi to give him permission to arrest the officers who were planning the coup. However, President Moi was not willing to involve the police in military matters. He preferred the matter to be dealt with internally by the military on Monday, August 2. However, the coup happened on Sunday, August 1 before any action could be taken. == Why the coup failed == Oteyo said that the coup failed because most of the soldiers did not execute their parts of the plan, as they were drinking and looting instead of going to arrest the president and his ministers. The coup leader, Ochuka, had gone to fetch a radio presenter, Leonard Mambo Mbotela. The plotters' poor organisation left the rebels unprepared for a counter-attack. They failed to capture or kill any of the political leaders they had targeted and did not seize the army headquarters. The air force rebels also lacked support from within the army, leaving them with no armor or heavy arms to take and hold key installations. ==Aftermath== The coup left more than 100 soldiers and perhaps 200 civilians dead, including several non-Kenyans. After the failed coup, the organizers were arrested and tried by court martial at the Army's Langata Barracks. Corporal Bramwel Injeni Njereman, who was an armaments technician, was the second to be convicted of treason on 24 November 1984. He was found guilty of five overt acts, and sentenced to death by hanging. Corporal Walter Odira Ojode was the first to be charged with the same offence, on 16 December 1982, of which he was found guilty; he also received the death penalty. Both appealed their cases and lost. Their death sentences, together with those of coup mastermind Ochuka and his counterpart Pancras Oteyo Okumuwere, were carried out on the night of 10 July 1985 at Kamiti Maximum Security Prison. Up to date they are the last people to have been executed under Kenyan law. A total of twelve people were sentenced to death, and over 900 were jailed. The convicts who were hanged were buried at the Kamiti Maximum Security Prison. During the trials, the name of Oginga Odinga was mentioned several times as having financed the organizers, and he was put under house arrest. His son Raila Odinga, together with other university lecturers, were sent to detention after being charged for treason. After the coup attempt, the entire Kenya Air Force was disbanded. The coup attempt was also a direct cause for the snap elections in 1983. In response to alleged campus involvement in the failed coup, the Kenyan government accused external communist sources of secretly funding the coup attempt. ==References== ==Further reading== * * * ==External links== * .

It was constructed by the Saint John Bridge and Railroad Extension Company which was a municipal-owned corporation established to connect two separated sections of the former European and North American Railway project. The eastern section of the E&NAR; was merged into the Intercolonial Railway following Confederation while the western section was acquired by the New Brunswick Railway (NBR). The Saint John Bridge and Railroad Extension Company was acquired by the NBR following the construction of the bridge. The NBR was purchased by the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1890. A replacement structure keeping much of the same design was opened in 1922 to accommodate heavier loads; the original being demolished in 1921. In 1976 NB Power constructed the Lorneville Pipeline from Irving Oil's Canaport supertanker oil terminal at Red Head, southeast of the city to the Coleson Cove Generating Station, southwest of the city; it crosses the Saint John River using this bridge. The City of Saint John also uses the bridge to carry water supply pipes.

It was released in North America on August 29, 2006, followed by an Australian release two days later and a European release on September 1, 2006 (the same day the mobile version was also released). It was met with generally positive critical reception; reviewers noted its similarities with the Grand Theft Auto series. It is the first game in the Saints Row series. Saints Row allows players to freely roam the play space and engage in missions at their leisure. Missions are unlocked by trading in \\"Respect\\" points, currency earned by completing mini-games, and are played through three story arcs each with the objective of overthrowing a rival gang. Saints Row is set in the fictional city of Stilwater, modeled after Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland, and Baltimore. The player character becomes inadvertently involved in a gunfight between the three gangs fighting for control of Stilwater; the Vice Kings, Los Carnales, and the Westside Rollerz. He joins the 3rd Street Saints gang, based out of the Saint's Row district, and works with the Saints to free Stilwater from control of the other gangs. The game's success led to the development of the Saints Row franchise, with Saints Row 2, which was released in 2008, and marked the series' first multiplatform game, Saints Row: The Third, which was released in 2011, Saints Row IV, which was released in 2013, and Saints Row: Gat out of Hell, which was released in 2015. ==Gameplay== At the beginning of the game, players create their character through a system that allows them to customize his ethnicity, fitness, face and hairstyle. After completing the first mission, players are then given free roam over the game's open world, the fictional city of Stilwater, which is modeled after Baltimore, Detroit, and Chicago. The game makes use of third- person view, which allows players to freely rotate the camera around their character. Players can run, jump, swim or utilize cars to navigate the world. They may also access the character customization system again at a plastic surgeon to apply cosmetic changes to their character. They can further alter the appearance of their character at clothing stores, tattoo parlors, barbers and jewelers, and tune vehicles at chop shops. A personal garage can be used to store customized vehicles, and vehicles that have been destroyed or lost can be redeemed for a cash fee. Bar the introductory and epilogue mission sequences, missions in Saints Row are divided between three linear story arcs which can be progressed through simultaneously or one by one, each with the objective of extinguishing a rival gang. Players engage in these missions at their leisure, but a prerequisite to instigate a mission is that they have filled up a bar on their Respect meter to allow them to unlock and play it. Respect is a currency earned by completing activities, which are mini-games that are scattered across the world and have increasing levels of difficulty. Missions and activities also accrue players cash income, which can be spent on goods and services such as weapons and clothes. Should players fail a mission, they may instantly reattempt it without incurring a loss of their Respect points. Cinemas scattered throughout the game world allow players to replay missions an unlimited number of times. RPG Launcher Players use hand-to-hand combat, melee weapons, firearms and explosives to fight rival gangs and the police. A free aiming reticule appears on the screen while players have weapons equipped. Weapons are accessed by a \\"weapon wheel\\" inventory system which appears on the screen as players hold down a button. Each of the eight slots on the wheel correspond to different types of weapons, such as submachine guns and pistols. Players may only carry one of each type of weapon at a time. Saints Row makes use of regenerative health, but this process can be accelerated by eating fast food items. A \\"wanted level\\" system governs the response by opposing forces to players' aggressive actions. In the head-up display, surrounding the minimap, are two bars; the topmost bar represents rival gangs and the bottommost bar represents the police. As players incite opposing forces, the corresponding bar fills up. Each bar filled is represented by the provoked enemy's logo, be it a star to represent the police or a \\"gang sign\\" to represent an enemy gang. One bar of notoriety will result in non-lethal retaliation however two, three, four or five bars of notoriety will result in a gradually increased lethal response. Notoriety depletes over time, but enemies will continue to be aggressive towards players until the meter recedes. Players may remove their notoriety instantly by utilizing drive-through confessional booths, visiting plastic surgeons, or inputting cheat codes. If arrested by the police, players will reappear outside a police station with a small bounty collected from their earnings. Player progression through the game directly affects the presence of their friendly gang, the 3rd Street Saints. The game world is subdivided between districts, such as the Red Light or Downtown districts, each comprising several neighborhoods. Each neighborhood is controlled by a rival gang, but as players complete missions the 3rd Street Saints will take over neighborhoods, causing street members of the gang to spawn there. The pause menu displays a large map of the game world, which allows players to view a graphical representation of the streetscape, and a color filter over each of the neighborhoods represents the gang whom control that neighborhood (purple for the Saints, yellow for the Kings, red for the Carnales and blue for the Rollerz). Saints Row features an in-game GPS navigation device, which allows players to set waypoints with a directional line indicating the quickest route to the marked destination. Players may enlist allied forces, referred to as homies, to aid in combat. Street members of the 3rd Street Saints may be summoned, or players may call up unique homies on their in-game mobile phones. Players can further utilize their mobile phone to contact services such as taxicabs, contact other numbers scattered throughout the map on billboards, or input cheat codes. ==Plot== In 2006, the city of Stilwater suffers from gang warfare at the hands of three distinct criminal syndicates: the Vice Kings, an African American gang that primarily earns revenue from strip clubs and record labels; Los Carnales, a Hispanic drug cartel that dominates the narcotics trade and gun running; and the Westside Rollerz, who operate on the lucrative underground racing club. The player, an unnamed figure, becomes caught in a crossfire between the three while walking through the streets of the Saint's Row district, but is saved by Troy Bradshaw, a member of a fourth gang called the 3rd Street Saints. Owing to the increasing violence, Saints leader Julius Little initiates the player into the gang and has them reclaim Saint's Row from their rivals, before assigning them to work under his top lieutenants, Dexter \\"Dex\\" Jackson, Johnny Gat, and Lin, in wiping out each rival gang. Gat focuses on hitting operations owned by the Kings, including faking the death of their key asset - Gat's girlfriend and popular R&B; singer Aisha - which culminate in the gang's leader, Benjamin King, being betrayed by his closest associates for refusing to respond to the Saints' actions. After Julius has him rescued, Benjamin agrees to retire in exchange for the deaths of those who turned on him. Meanwhile, Dex focuses on the Carnales by having the player help the Saints take over their drug operations, ultimately leading to the gang eliminating the Carnales' leaders, Hector and Angelo Lopez, and securing a deal with the gang's chief supplier. Concurrently, Lin works undercover amongst the Rollerz, slowly learning that the gang is attempting to source and steal vehicles for a client. After Lin is killed by their leader, private attorney William Sharp, the player retaliates by murdering him, along with his nephew when he declares war on the Saints. With the city firmly under the control of the Saints, Julius makes the player his chief lieutenant. Shortly after this, Stilwater's corrupt police chief, Richard Monroe, arrests Julius and threatens to kill him unless the player helps to murder the city's mayor and allow his opponent, Alderman Richard Hughes, to win the upcoming mayoral election. Correctly guessing that Monroe has no intention of upholding his promise, the Saints ambush Monroe's motorcade and kill him, freeing Julius. After becoming mayor, Hughes invites the player to his private yacht, and reveals his intention to have the Saints arrested and Saint's Row sold to private developers after being razed. Unknown to the player, Troy prepares to meet with the cops, having been an undercover cop himself, while Julius watches the yacht from a distance. Just as Hughes orders for the player's execution, the yacht is destroyed in an explosion, ending the story on a cliffhanger. ==Development== Volition began work on Saints Row in late-2004, as a PlayStation 2 game under the title Bling Bling. The design philosophy behind Saints Rows arcing mission structure was to provide players with more freedom in how they interact with the open world. By developing three story arcs, the team wanted to provide a nonlinear approach by allowing players to progress through the story at their leisure. Adhering to such a design philosophy created a challenge for the team, as they had to balance the open-ended nature of the mission structure with a story progression that felt natural and player-engaging. \\"Stories, by definition, are fairly linear, so the two goals conflicted with each other\\", design director Christopher Stockman opined. During development, the team turned to earlier open world games to establish principles for innovation, adopting the design philosophy \\"everything matters\\". The team wanted to synthesise game mechanics together to make the missions, activities and customization options work in tandem. Stockman felt that previous open world games did not reward players for experimenting with the sandbox enough because story progression was siphoned off from free roam gameplay. From this sentiment, the concept of the activities developed; players in Saints Row would be encouraged into off-mission content because progression through activities would unlock more story missions. The team would conduct review meetings to assess how the activities developed and whether or not refinements would need to be made. Some activities went through larger design changes than others; in an earlier inception of Drug Trafficking, players would have driven around the city providing addicts with narcotics while under the pressure of a time limit. Concurrently, the team were making refinements to defensive sequences in the story missions, which influenced the final revision of the Drug Trafficking activity. Developing the city Stilwater required scaling back revisions to appropriate for a play space that could be comfortably traversed. During early production the team rendered an elementary model of the city in the engine, and drove around in the model to get a sense of the city's scale. They found the revision too small, so they quadrupled its dimensions, but soon had to scale it back to a more manageable size. Having found an appropriate size, the team began working on the city in detail, adding in transportation networks and buildings. The team made further revisions during this process as necessary, balancing the number of interior models like shops and mission- related buildings in each district so that no one section of the city would feel denser than another. Some districts planned for the city, such as an indoor shopping mall, a train station, and a trailer park, were cut during development and were added in Saints Row 2. ==Soundtrack== The soundtrack of Saints Row includes over 130 musical tracks covering the classical, easy listening, drum and bass/breakbeat, metal, reggae, rock, R&B; and hip hop genres. The music is presented by 12 radio stations, and there is an in-game music player accessible through the pause menu. The player purchases songs for the music player at the record store franchise \\"Scratch That Music\\" in Stilwater using in-game money. ==Downloadable content== Several packages of downloadable content (DLC) have been released. The DLCs are as follows: *Funky Fresh Pack - players get over sixty exclusive clothing and accessory options *Industrial Map Pack - players get a new map for use in competitive multiplayer modes *Ho Ho Ho Pack - players get Christmas-themed costumes and hair styles *Gankster Pack - players get two exclusive vehicles and a co-op mission *Exclusive Unkut Pack - players get access to Unkut-themed outfits and tattoos As of 2013, those DLCs are no longer available on the Xbox Live network. They were re-introduced on July 29, 2015. ==Sequels== ==Reception== Prior to the retail version of Saints Row being released, the demo set an Xbox Live Marketplace then-record for being downloaded more than 350,000 times in the first week of its release. The game received \\"favorable\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Reviewers likened Saints Row to the Grand Theft Auto series; some felt the game improved upon the gameplay of Grand Theft Auto, but others criticized the game's lack of originality. Steven Embling of play.tm wrote that while the game \\"isn't going to win any awards for originality\\", the game's graphics and sound design were \\"impressive\\" and \\"highly commendable\\". Ryan McCaffrey of GamesRadar+ considered the game a worthy entry into a genre beholden to Grand Theft Auto, praising the game's graphics and use of the Havok engine, but lamenting the Respect system for disrupting story progression. Will Tuttle of GameSpy considered that while not all players would respond positively to the Respect system necessitating mission progression, the Activities \\"offer some of the game's most memorable sequences\\". Scott Sharkey of 1UP.com noted that Saints Row removed frustrating elements from previous Grand Theft Auto games, like load times between city sections and combat reliant on auto-aim, but considered its attempts to recreate urban gang culture and satire \\"so hackneyed that they cast an embarrassing shadow over the whole thing\\". In Japan, where the game was ported for release on June 21, 2007, Famitsu gave it a score of one nine, two eights, and one nine for a total of 34 out of 40. Detroit Free Press gave the game a score of all four stars and said it was \\"the deepest and most exciting to date of all the freewheeling street shooter games. There are missions and activities galore.\\" The Times similarly gave it all five stars and said, \\"This is a game guaranteed to offend and entertain in equal measure, but it is emphatically not for children.\\" The Sydney Morning Herald gave it four stars out of five and said that the game \\"lacks the clever subtlety and fun-loving sense of mischief of Grand Theft Auto, with much of its humour falling flat. But there's plenty of fun to be had while waiting for the real deal (\\"GTA IV\\") to be released in October next year.\\" 411Mania gave it a score of 7.5 out of 10 and said it was \\"as addictive and guilty-as-sin fun as the game it imitates, and this is one case where imitation is the best form of flattery.\\" The A.V. Club similarly gave it a B and called it \\"the perfect thug sim for your younger siblings.\\" Saints Row received awards from GameSpot for \\"Most Surprisingly Good Game of 2006\\", as well as Gaming Target for one of 52 Games We will Still Be Playing From 2006 selection. Saints Row sold over 2 million copies, and has since joined the Xbox 360 lineup of \\"Platinum Hits\\" games. ==References* Category:2006 video games Category:Cancelled PlayStation 3 games Category:Mobile games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Organized crime video games Category:Saints Row Category:THQ games Category:Video games with downloadable content Category:Xbox 360 games Category:Xbox 360-only games Category:Video games set in 2006 Category:Open world video games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games using Havok de:Saints Row ","title":"Saints Row (video game)"},{"id":"3236556","text":"Jay Underwood (born October 1, 1968) is an American actor and pastor.

Incorporated as a charitable organization in 2000, the institute pursues new ideas to focus the national debate and understanding of Canada's international policies with the ultimate aim of ensuring a more globally engaged Canada. Global Affairs believes that doing so enhances Canadian security and prosperity. Global Affairs is dedicated to educating Canadians, and particularly those who have leadership roles in shaping Canadian foreign policy, about the importance of Canada being proactive in world affairs with tangible diplomatic, military and aid assets. == Activities == === The Dispatch === The Canadian Global Affairs Institute produces a quarterly newsletter called The Dispatch. The Dispatch invites Global Affairs fellows to provide insight on international issues of relevance to Canada. === Strategic Studies Working Group === The Strategic Studies Working Group (SSWG) is a partnership between the Canadian Global Affairs Institute and the Canadian International Council (CIC), which incorporates the former Canadian Institute of Strategic Studies. The SSWG is administered by Global Affairs which also conducts research and produces publications on security and defence issues on behalf of the partnership. All projects undertaken by the SSWG are first approved by CIC and are co-published or co e-published according to CIC standards. The SSWG has begun to host E-Conferences on issues related to defence and security. The e-conferences are structured to take place over a number of weeks, with each week having a specific topic. The e-conferences include regular commentaries by academics and practitioners, Twitter Q&A;'s, live chats and major articles placed in national media. * The Future of Fighting conference focused on what the Canadian Forces might look like in the coming decade to reflect the changing funding and combat environment. * The Drone Week conference was focused on understanding some of the practical, legal and moral questions surrounding the current use of drones and what future lies ahead for the use of unmanned aerial vehicles. The SSWG produces Research Papers which keep in line with the partnership's purpose of focusing on defence and security topics. The Strategic Profile Canada is a project which provides a comprehensive overview of Canada's demographic, economic and military information. === 3Ds Blog === The 3Ds Blog is a site managed by Global Affairs and provides defence and security news from Canada and around the world. Blog updates are made by Global Affairs fellows, the majority coming from Mark Collins. === Speakers Series === The Canadian Global Affairs Institute organizes a speakers series which is annually themed on a specific topic of importance to Canadian defence, security, and foreign affairs issues. The speaking events are held quarterly in Calgary and brings together business people, academics, and praticioners to listen to some of Canada's mosat important and influential thinkers. Former speakers include Peter MacKay, Minister of National Defence; Michael Bell, former diplomat; and Yuen Pau Woo, president and CEO of the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada among others. === Ross Munro Award === The Ross Munro Media Award was initiated, in 2002, by the Conference of Defence Associations, in concert with the Canadian Global Affairs Institute. Its purpose is to recognize, annually, one Canadian journalist who has made a significant and outstanding contribution to the understanding, by the general public, of Canada's defence and security issues. === Military Journalism Course === The Military Journalism Course was started in 2002 as a nine-day course which introduces university students to military journalism and the Canadian Armed Forces. The course is run in partnership with the Centre for Military and Strategic Studies at the University of Calgary and includes a combination of media-military theory in a classroom setting, coupled with field visits to Armed Forces regular and reserve units. The stated goal of the program is to enhance the military education of future Canadian journalists who will report on Canadian military activities domestically and abroad. In 2007, the program introduced its first Francophone Military Journalism course held at the Université de Montréal and Canadian Forces Base Valcartier, near Québec City. == Advisory Council == A group of advisers provide feedback on current and future programs. * Ian Brodie * Jean Charest, PC * Laura Dawson * Richard Fadden * Robert Fowler, OC * Dan Hays, PC * Marie-Lucie Morin, PC * John Manley, PC OC * Bob Rae, PC OC * Christopher Waddell * Robert Wright == Fellowship Program == === Fellows === * David Bercuson, OC, FRSC * Jean-Christophe Boucher * Brett Boudreau * Brian Bow * David Carment * Joseph Caron * Andrea Charron * Howard Coombs * Barry Cooper * Daryl Copeland * Jocelyn Coulon * D.

In an article from July 2016, The Globe and Mail examines the Institutes support of Canada's $15-billion combat-vehicle sale to Saudi Arabia at a time of a humanitarian crisis in Yemen, and the think tank's acceptance of donations from defense contractor General Dynamics – the parent of the arms maker in the export contract. An article in 2017 from The Huffington Post goes on to say about the Saudi Arms deal \\"At least four of the General Dynamics-funded institute's \\"fellows\\" wrote columns justifying the sale, including an opinion Perry published in The Globe and Mail Report on Business titled \\"Without foreign sales, Canada's defence industry would not survive.\\" == References == ==External links== * Category:Military of Canada Category:Think tanks based in Canada Category:Foreign policy and strategy think tanks Category:Organizations established in 2001 Category:2001 establishments in Alberta Category:Internet properties established in 2001 Category:Non-profit organizations based in Alberta Category:Political and economic think tanks based in Canada Category:Think tanks established in 2001 ","title":"Canadian Global Affairs Institute"},{"id":"3236562","text":"This is a listing of illuminated manuscripts produced between 900 and 1066 in Anglo-Saxon monasteries, or by Anglo-Saxon scribes or illuminators working in continental scriptoria. This list includes manuscripts in Latin and Anglo- Saxon. For manuscripts produced before 900 see the List of Hiberno-Saxon illuminated manuscripts. The invasions during the reign of King Alfred the Great created a disruption in the manuscript production in England. When manuscript production resumed in the later portion of Alfred's reign, a break with the previous Insular style of manuscript illumination occurred. The new style, although drawing some elements from Insular manuscripts, also was influenced by Carolingian, Byzantine, and Mediterranean traditions. The Norman Conquest produced another break in English manuscript production which ended the Anglo-Saxon tradition of manuscript illumination. For more information see Anglo-Saxon art. ==Listing== This listing includes every surviving manuscript with Anglo-Saxon miniatures, drawings, or other major decoration.

It is named after Richard Barrer. ==Definition== \\\\rm {1} \\\\ barrer = {10^{-10}} \\\\frac{ cm^3_{STP} \\\\cdot cm}{cm^2 \\\\cdot s \\\\cdot cmHg} Here the 'cm3STP' is standard cubic centimeter, which is a unit of amount of gas rather than a unit of volume. It represents the amount of gas molecules or moles that would occupy one cubic centimeter at standard temperature and pressure, as calculated via the ideal gas law. The cm corresponds in the permeability equations to the thickness of the material whose permeability is being evaluated, the cm3STPcm−2s−1 to the flux of gas through the material, and the cmHg to the pressure drop across the material. That is, it measures the rate of fluid flow passing through an area of material with a thickness driven by a given pressure. See Darcy's Law.

It opened in 1968. ==History== By the mid-20th century, the rate of industrial and residential growth in Saint John and surrounding communities necessitated a second bridge over the Saint John River. The old Reversing Falls Bridge was adequate for handling the post-War traffic growth; however public concerns about where to build a new highway and bridge frustrated the idea for many years. On May 1, 1961 the city's Common Council appointed a 6-member citizens' committee which then directed various studies and discussions. Ultimately, the bridge was built as a cooperative project between the federal, provincial and municipal governments. They decided to purchase the majority of the Mill Street Yard from the Canadian Pacific Railway for a new highway alignment which would run through the middle of the city downstream of Reversing Falls. The federally controlled National Harbours Board (now Ports Canada) would build the bridge. Part of this deal involved the NHB collecting a 25¢ toll in each direction. Under the original act prevented any toll increase or forty years without federal, provincial and municipal agreement. . The selected location remains controversial as it prevents high-clearance vessels from navigating into the upper part of the Saint John Harbour. Construction of the bridge also drew to a close the status of Navy Island as an island within the Inner Harbour and resulted in the demolition of the historic neo-gothic Union Station. Earlier proposals had called for the Saint John Throughway and the bridge to be built north of the Reversing Falls gorge. ==Design and capacity== Saint John Harbour Bridge was designed and built as a hollow box, haunched girder structure. It carries four lanes traffic across 3 spans, measuring , , and . Contracts for the four main piers were signed in September 1965 and the crossing opened on August 17, 1968 as part of the ambitious Saint John Throughway project. Sinuous lines of the Saint John Harbour Bridge snake across the harbour in the morning fogTolls were set at 25 cents when the bridge was constructed. The Harbour Bridge Authority increased the cash-toll from $0.25 to $0.50 for regular commuter traffic beginning January, 2007. This is the first, and only, permitted rate increase since the bridge was built; however, by 2010, the tolls were eliminated, and the building later demolished. ==Transfer of authority== Meanwhile, by 2010, more than forty years after the bridge was built, it was in need of more than $35 million worth of repairs. Without the necessary repairs, the Harbour Bridge Authority warned it would need to close two lanes of traffic and impose weight restrictions on the bridge, threatening to inhibit traffic flow during commute times as well as posing as a problem to transports coming to and from the bordering state of Maine.CBC News \\"Saint John Harbour Bridge repairs needed soon\\", CBC News, 24 March 2010 The three levels of government negotiating the project's financing. On November 26, 2010 Stephen Harper and David Alward announced an agreement. It eliminated the toll and wiped away a $22.6 million debt, while the Federal Government agreed to pay for half of the $35 million structural repairs.CBC News, \\"Harper reveals Saint John bridge deal\\". CBC. 26 November 2010 . The Bridge Authority was abolished and management of the bridge was placed under the New Brunswick Department of Transportation and Infrastructure. In 2013, the Department announced that it had sold the office building formerly used by the Bridge Authority to the Saint John Port Authority. ==References== Category:Road bridges in New Brunswick Category:Bridges over the Saint John River (Bay of Fundy) Category:Bridges completed in 1968 Category:Transport in Saint John, New Brunswick Category:Buildings and structures in Saint John, New Brunswick Category:Former toll bridges in Canada ","title":"Saint John Harbour Bridge"},{"id":"3236609","text":"Wells Street Terminal was a stub-end downtown terminal on the 'L' in Chicago, Illinois, located at Wells Street between Jackson Boulevard and Van Buren Street. The terminal was in operation from 1904 to 1953. ==History== The Fifth Avenue Terminal (as it was originally known) was built by the Metropolitan West Side Elevated Railroad in 1904 to establish a terminal for rush hour elevated train traffic. Along with Chicago's other elevated railroad operators, the Metropolitan operated most of its trains on the Loop elevated through Chicago's central business district. However, the tracks of the Loop 'L' were operating at capacity during rush hours, and could not handle the additional train traffic needed to satisfy demand. Accordingly, the Metropolitan ran some of its rush hour services to Wells Street Terminal instead of circling the Loop. Similar terminals were used by the other elevated railroad operators of Chicago, but the Metropolitan's Wells Street Terminal had the advantage of being directly adjacent to the Loop \\"L\\" tracks on Wells Street and even had a transfer bridge to the Quincy Street station on the Loop 'L'. The Metropolitan's services included trains operating on its Garfield Park main line, the Douglas Park branch, and the Logan Square and Humboldt Park branch. These lines are ancestors of Chicago Transit Authority's present-day Blue and Pink Line services, though only small remnants of the original lines remain as part of today's Blue Line route. In 1905, the Metropolitan's elevated trains at the terminal were joined by the interurban trains of the Aurora Elgin and Chicago Railway. The terminal was the only downtown facility used by the interurban; their trains did not use the Loop 'L'. The Franklin Street Substation is all that remains of the former terminal Wells Street Terminal consisted of four stub-end tracks using two island platforms and in 1907, over 100 rush-hour trains used the facility. With the completion of the Milwaukee-Dearborn subway in 1951, Logan Square trains were rerouted into the subway, terminating at the temporary terminal LaSalle/Congress subway station. With changing traffic patterns and increasing use of automobiles resulting in lower train frequencies, CTA was able to end 'L' service to the terminal late the same year. After the CTA took over 'L' operations after World War II, service to the Wells Street Terminal was decreased as operations were revised. In 1948, Humboldt Park branch service was cut back to Damen at all hours except during rush hour, when the trains served Wells Street Terminal. At the same time, all Logan Square trains were routed onto the Loop, leaving only Humboldt trains and certain Garfield and Douglas runs serving Wells. On February 25, 1951, all Milwaukee (Logan Square) trains were rerouted into the new Milwaukee-Dearborn Subway, with all Humboldt service to a shuttle operation to Damen. Later that year, on December 9, Garfield and Douglas service was revised and those services were also withdrawn from Well Street Terminal, thus ending all 'L' service to the station. The Chicago Aurora and Elgin continued to use the terminal, though a problem loomed as plans for a new superhighway — the Congress Street Expressway — called for the road to be built on the route of Garfield Park 'L', necessitating the demolition of the elevated structure. Though the plans included a new rapid transit rail line in the median strip of the new highway, connecting with the Milwaukee-Dearborn subway, and though a temporary right- of-way was established to allow rail service to continue during construction, a number of operational and political obstacles led to the interurban deciding to change their service to the outer terminal of the elevated line at Des Plaines Avenue in Forest Park. Interurban riders therefore had to change trains to or from CTA trains at the Forest Park station to continue their rides after September 20, 1953. This change brought an end to the use of Wells Street Terminal. The building was razed in 1955 and two of the terminal tracks connected to the Loop 'L' as a temporary connection, but with the completion of the expressway and new Congress rapid transit line on June 22, 1958, the Garfield Park 'L' came to an end and Congress trains were routed via the subway. The connecting tracks at the terminal's former location were removed in 1964. ==References== ==External links== * Wells Street Terminal article on chicago-l.org * Chicago Transit Authority official site Category:Railway stations in Chicago Category:Chicago \\"L\\" terminal stations Category:Former Chicago, Aurora, and Elgin stations Category:Railway stations in the United States opened in 1904 Category:Railway stations closed in 1953 Category:1904 establishments in Illinois Category:1953 disestablishments in Illinois Category:Defunct Chicago \\"L\\" stations ","title":"Wells Street Terminal"},{"id":"3236611","text":" The Curtiss XA-14 was a 1930s United States airplane, the first multi- engine attack aircraft tested by the United States Army Air Corps.

As of the 2010 census, the population of Clallam Bay was 363. ==History== Clallam Bay was founded in the 1880s as a steamboat stop. It became a mill town in 1890. Two years later, the mill burned, and making barrels for West Clallam Bay's tanning extract became its main industry. In 1905, the lighthouse at Slip Point was lighted on April Fool's Day. Sekiu Point (pronounced \\"See'-kew\\"), the western cape of Clallam Bay, was first charted by Captain Henry \\"OG\\" Kellett in 1847. The town of Sekiu was founded as \\"West Clallam\\" in 1870, by A.J. Martin who built a salmon cannery to be nearer the fishing grounds. The area boomed before the turn of the century when a leather tanning extract was produced here by the Pacific Tanning Extract Company established in 1887. Sekiu crashed in 1893 when the demand for the extract ceased, and hundreds of men were left unemployed. People turned to fishing, and later logging. From 1902 to 1907, D.A. Robinson logged here, building a railroad with what was then the longest railroad bridge in the world.

The ridings that are entirely rural (e.g. Souris-Moose Mountain and Yorkton-Melville) are almost as conservative as ridings in rural Alberta, and are even more so now with issues like same-sex marriage being highly unpopular. The urban areas of Regina and Moose Jaw are traditionally more supportive of the New Democratic Party, but they were wiped out in three-way races in 2004, and were unable to recover in 2006 or 2008. The Liberals also has some support in Regina, but it really only translates into one seat - that of local born and raised veteran politician, former Finance Minister, former Public Safety Minister and former Liberal deputy leader Ralph Goodale. Like Saskatoon, Regina has double the population of a typical Canadian urban riding. However, until 2015 the surrounding areas were thought to be too thinly populated for ridings of their own. As a result, for almost two decades Regina's four federal ridings included large blocks of rural territory. The rural presence in the Regina area ridings largely neutralized the NDP and Liberal blocs after the end of vote-splitting on the right in 2004. With the 2015 redistribution, Regina is now split between three ridings—one hybrid urban-rural riding and two located almost entirely within the city limits. Mirroring the split in the city as a whole, each major party took one seat each, with the NDP winning a seat here for the first time since 2000. In 2019, however, the entire province swung over dramatically to support Conservative leader Andrew Scheer, who holds the hybrid urban-rural seat of Regina—Qu'Appelle. The Tories swept the entire region, in the process unseating the Prairies' highest-profile minister, Goodale.

It was the production test version of that company's A-14 Shrike. ==Design and development== In the years leading up to World War II, the United States Army Air Corps were interested in attack aircraft capable of carrying larger bomb loads with greater firepower. The attack aircraft design standard essentially became a light bomber with firepower only slightly less than the medium bombers being developed as the standard machine gun generally was replaced by ones on new aircraft in development. The Curtiss YA-14 prototype that emerged in 1935 was one of the first single-mission attack aircraft.

During its service with the 8th Attack Squadron, the retractable landing gear of the A-18 had an inherent weakness, with no less than eight of the 13 A-18s suffering from a landing gear collapse on landing or roll-out. The last of the A-18s with the 8th were replaced by early-model A-20 Havocs in 1941. The A-18 was only used for a short time before being replaced by more advanced attack aircraft. After its service with the 8th AS, the aircraft were assigned to several Light Bombardment Squadrons during 1940-42, likely being used as support aircraft. The last A-18 Shrike II was retired from front line squadrons in 1942; none of the aircraft were ever used in combat.Eden and Moeng 2002, p. 517.

When interviewed he stated “We didn’t want them to lay a wreath because we didn’t want them—and they are just another start to the denigration of Anzac Day,” and \\"I don't remember a single poofter from World War II.\\" In 1980 Ruxton criticised the Northcote City Council in Victoria, after left-wing Councillors supported a number of policies that were anathema to those traditionally held by the RSL. These included the flying of the Eureka flag rather than the Australian flag from the Northcote Town Hall, and support for an Australian republic.Andrew Lemon (1983), The Northcote Side of the River, Hargreen Publishing Company, North Melbourne, Page 269. Ruxton claimed 'ethnics and anti-British elements' were responsible for a lack of patriotism.P. Connelly (1981), 'Hoisting the Flag,' in Nation Review, February, Page 22 Ruxton was also incensed at the refusal of Scottish-born Councillor Brian Sanaghan to renew his oath of allegiance to the Queen after being re-elected to the Northcote Council in 1980.Lemon, p.269 Pressure from Ruxton resulted in Sanaghan's place on the Council being declared vacant.P. Innes (1981), 'No allegiance to Queen: councillor,' The Age (Melbourne), 11 June, p.5 Ruxton's referred to the Anglican Bishop Desmond Tutu as a \\"witch doctor\\" during Tutu's visit to Victoria in 1986, an outburst he later acknowledged he regretted. Ruxton was an opponent of Asian immigration.https://www.afr.com/politics/new-rsl-chief-enters-migrant- row-19880907-k307d In the 1998 Constitutional Convention for the Republic he represented monarchist group Safeguard the People.Vizard, Steve, Two Weeks in Lilliput: Bear Baiting and Backbiting At the Constitutional Convention (Penguin, 1998, ) On 31 January 1992, Ruxton stated that the RSL and its membership: \\"will never agree to this country becoming a republic. We are proud to be associated with the Queen, who is our patron, and who, as this country's head of State, has never once put a foot wrong. Show me a politician with such a record.\\" Ruxton consistently argued that the Australian flag and the Queen, as the Australian head of state, guarantee that Australia will remain a free democracy, and that a republican form of government in Australia could become totalitarian.Lyle Allan, Paul Dahan and Leanne Williams (1995), Introduction to Australian Government, RMIT and Open Training Services, Melbourne (Victoria), page 17 In 1991, Ruxton appeared on the Nine Network's Midday television show with host Ray Martin, to advocate Australia remaining a monarchy, in a live televised debate with singer Normie Rowe and radio broadcaster Ron Casey. The debate got out of hand, with Normie Rowe and Ron Casey physically brawling on live TV. The following day, Ruxton said: \\"As for Ron Casey, he deserved a good punch in the nose. He certainly did not do his cause any good. We have enough problems to fix up without arguing and fighting over whether Australia should become a republic,\\" In 1998, Ruxton wrote a letter to Shock Records regarding the TISM single \\"I Might Be a Cunt, but I'm Not a Fucking Cunt\\". In it, he referred to the single \\"dropping (Australia)'s standards into the proverbial sewer\\". ==Popular culture== A character originally from Australia You're Standing In It (and later in Fast Forward), Bruce Rump, was based on him. Bruce Rump would rant in a voice similar to Ruxton's, sometimes reaching a violent frenzy and ending with the non-sequitur \\"... and that's why we should keep the bloody flag the same!\\" The send ups of Bruce Rump would often also be send ups of long running Australian children's TV series Romper Room, referred to as \\"Rumper Room\\". Ruxton made fun of himself by releasing a rap single, in which he lampooned his own persona. A song by Melbourne punk band Res-Heads was named after Ruxton. ==Honours== In 1975 he was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE), an Officer of the Order (OBE) in 1981, and a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) in 1996. In 1997 he was appointed a Chevalier of the Order of Merit by Jacques Chirac. He was also appointed a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour. == Death == He died on 23 December 2011, following the development of dementia. He was 85.

He was one of American sports' most famous PA voices, and remains among its most revered race callers. Anderson's narration of the 1973 Belmont Stakes, where he described Secretariat as \\"moving like a tremendous machine\\", remains one of horse racing's most memorable calls. ==Racing background== A native of Evansville, Indiana, Anderson got his start in horse racing in 1951, working part-time in the mutuel department at Dade Park (now Ellis Park Racecourse) in nearby Henderson, Kentucky. Eight years later, in 1959, Anderson became track announcer. The following year, in 1960, Anderson also became the public-address voice of Churchill Downs, home of the Kentucky Derby. He would call 16 Runs for the Roses between then and 1977. During that stretch, Anderson also worked as a Midwest sports anchor, gaining the TV experience that would serve him well nationally in the 1970s. In addition to Ellis and Churchill, Anderson worked at Oaklawn Park, Santa Anita Park, Ak-Sar-Ben and Arlington Park racetracks in the 1960s and 1970s. Starting in 1969, Anderson's Derby calls would not only be heard by Churchill patrons but also on the CBS Television Network, where he assumed Jack Drees' role on the network's coverage of all three Triple Crown races, as well as other thoroughbred events. Anderson would eventually gain a level of fame as a national race caller exceeded only by that of Clem McCarthy and Ted Husing. Because of his TV experience and knowledge of horses, CBS adopted him as a full-fledged member of their sportscasting team for big races, providing jockey interviews and insights as well as the race calls. Anderson would remain at Churchill Downs until May 1977. After calling Seattle Slew's victory in the Derby for both Churchill and ABC Television, he moved his base of operations to the New York Racing Association (NYRA) tracks, including Belmont Park, succeeding NYRA race caller Dave Johnson. That allowed him to call Slew's victory in the 1977 Belmont Stakes for the racetrack, which likely makes Anderson the only man to call two Triple Crown races on the tracks' public-address systems in one year. During his NYRA tenure, Anderson's daily calls would not only be heard by fans at the track, but also on WCBS radio. In November 1978, Anderson called Seattle Slew's last race, the Stuyvesant Handicap at Aqueduct Racetrack, live for CBS Television, WCBS radio, and fans at the track. As Slew, ridden by Ángel Cordero Jr., roared down the stretch far enough in front to ensure a win, Anderson emoted. \\"Ladies and gentlemen, here he is, the champion of the world, Seattle Slew!\\" ==Notable race calls== For CBS Television, Anderson authored the two most famous calls in horse- racing history—and two of the most famous sportscasts in TV history—the Triple Crown clinchings in the Belmont Stakes of 1973 and 1978. ===\\"A tremendous machine!\\"=== Anderson was behind the CBS microphone for the 1973 Belmont Stakes, when Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes winner Secretariat tried to become the first horse in a quarter-century to win the Triple Crown. A stunned Anderson punctuated Secretariat's powerful move on the final turn of the race this way, focusing on Secretariat while still keeping tabs on the other horses' positions: A few minutes later, reviewing the videotape of Secretariat's stretch romp, Anderson humbly admitted it was hard to count lengths as Secretariat raced toward home. \\"I said twenty-five,\\" Anderson said. \\"It could conceivably have been more.\\" In fact, the champion's winning margin was fully 31 lengths—a distance it took careful examination of videotape and trackside photographs to measure. Secretariat was so far ahead when he crossed the finish line that the TV camera operator had to pan to the left to pick up the rest of the field, in lieu of leaving an \\"empty\\" track in the viewer's line of sight for a few seconds. ===\\"We'll test these two to the wire!\\"=== Five years later, for both CBS Sports and the Belmont Park fans, Anderson called a 1978 Belmont Stakes race that was as close as the 1973 Belmont was a romp. Affirmed and Alydar--who battled each other closely both as two-year-old horses and in the 1978 Triple Crown races (with Affirmed prevailing barely in both the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes)--renewed their battle in that year's Belmont. They hooked up in earnest a half-mile into the race and held a virtual match race for the rest of the event. Then, shutting off the PA microphone (as track announcers did then) but keeping his CBS microphone hot, he described the final moment of victory: ===1975 Kentucky Derby=== Anderson's only prominent mistake came in the 1975 Kentucky Derby, which he called for both the Churchill Downs fans and ABC Television. Confused by the similar silks of favorite Foolish Pleasure and Prince Thou Art, he described Prince Thou Art as the leader during the late stages of the race, before correcting himself near the end. A newspaper headline on Anderson's rare error read \\"Prince Thou Ain't\\". History-minded observers compared it to a similar mistake that announcer Clem McCarthy had made during the running of the 1947 Preakness Stakes. ==Voice of racing== Anderson's style as a public-address announcer—even when the PA call was also carried on TV—was low-key, almost robotic, at the start of a race. (On arena PA systems, rapid-fire calls often end up a blur to the ears of fans scattered throughout a track or stadium). Anderson would then pick up a vibrant pace halfway through the race. Anderson used a more animated style at the start when his call aired only on TV, maintaining a brisk pace while remaining measured, avoiding the clichés and the screaming style other track announcers adopted in the 1980s and beyond. ==Personal life== Anderson attended Wabash College for two years, served two years in the United States Navy, and then received a degree from Indiana University. He and his wife, Marsha, had five children. Anderson died of a heart attack at age 47 on March 24, 1979, at his home in Commack, New York, on Long Island. He was succeeded at both NYRA and CBS by his backup, Marshall Cassidy. ==References== ==External links== * Secretariat Belmont Stakes 1973 & extended coverage via YouTube * Affirmed - 1978 Belmont Stakes via YouTube Category:1931 births Category:1979 deaths Category:American sports announcers Category:Sportspeople from Evansville, Indiana Category:Public address announcers Category:American horse racing announcers Category:People from Commack, New York Category:Indiana University alumni ","title":"Chic Anderson"},{"id":"3236668","text":"Jeong Jung-bu (1106 – 18 October 1179) was a medieval Korean soldier and military dictator during the Goryeo Dynasty (918–1392). He was a career soldier, qualified on military part of civil service examination. He was most noted for leading a coup d'état in 1170 (Revolt of military officers), dethroning the king and beginning of 100-year military reign in Korea. ==Early career== Jeong was born in 1106; he learned martial arts and military tactics in his early days. He was often reported to be 7-foot-tall giant with great confidence and intelligence. He was a diligent soldier, and his loyalty earned him the trust from the king. He went through a slow promotion and later became Chief of General Staff. At the time he became a soldier, the Goryeo Dynasty had a policy that put the civilian power over military. The policy benefited the dynasty well during its early days, and many civilian officials were also able military commanders, such as Gang Gam-chan and Yoon Gwan. However, the civilian rule made many side-effects as time passed on; the military generals was seen as servants, or even slaves of the civilian officials, and treated as slaves by many government officials and advisers to the king. In 998, King Mokjong put military under civilian command, causing the coup d'état of General Gang Jo. In 1014, military officers were not paid because the government had to pay civilian officials first, causing the anger of Generals Choi Jil and Kim Hoon to attempt a failed military rebellion; and later the government even closed the military academy. The grief of army officers became greater and greater as the treatment and view toward them got harsher. ==Coup== In 1167, during the royal banquet of King Uijong, Kim Don-jung, son of powerful aristocrat Kim Bu-sik (author of Samguk Sagi), burned Jeong's long beard with a candle, and made fun of him and also mocked the whole military. The incident caused Jeong to have a strong animosity toward aristocrats and civilian officials. In 1170, King Uijong went to his royal villa to rest and to hold another feast, and he also held a martial arts competition. A young soldier won the event, and was praised by the king. Then, many of king's advisers to the court and eunuchs forced General Yi So-eung, who was at his late fifties, to face the champion, who was about 20. The old general, of course, was not able to fight the young champion and fell down to the ground. Then, a young civilian official named Han Roe, insulted the general and even slapped him across his face in front of the king and many fellow soldiers. General Jeong, who could not stand the advisers' attitude anymore, knocked Han out and insulted him. The incident caused the long grievances of military to explode; young soldiers, notably Colonels Yi Ui-bang, Yi Go and Chae Won, urged Jeong to launch a coup d'état against the entire government and the king, who favored civilian officials over army. Jeong first ignored their opinion but later agreed to revolt against the government. With his order, in the name of commander-in-chief, the whole army rebelled against the king and his advisers. Almost all of advisers, including Kim Don-jung and Han Roe, were killed and King Uijong was overthrown. Jeong then set up a puppet king, King Myeongjong, beginning the 100-year military rule of Korea. ==Post coup== However, after the coup d'état in 1170, the leaders of the revolution began to feud with each other. Generals Yi Go and Chae Won were killed by General Yi Ui-bang for treason. Then Yi visited Jeong, who adopted him as a son, only for a while. In 1173, a surviving civilian official Kim Bodang rebelled in northeastern border, trying to restore the civilian order under deposed King Uijong. Yi Ui-bang decided to assassinate Uijong; and after he killed the ex- king, Yi put down the rebellion, which put Yi on the peak of the power. Then Yi began to oppress Buddhism and Confucianism, executed many civilian administrators and scholars, raped royal family members and forced the Crown Prince to marry his daughter. His despotic reign caused the grief of many people, and finally in 1174, a chain of rebellion that lasted for 50 years began in Pyongyang by Jo Wi-chong. Yi Ui-bang sent massive troops to put down the rebellion. General Jeong, who promoted himself as Prime Minister, decided to put an end to Yi's reign of terror. He ordered his son, Jeong Gyun, and his son-in-law, General Song Yuin, to kill Yi Ui-bang. Yi was finally murdered by Jeong Gyun, and the power passed to Jeong Jung-bu. Jeong continued to fight against rebels in Pyongyang; however, slaves and people of lowest class of present-day Gongju rebelled against the government. Jeong managed to crush the uprising of Jo, and entered negotiation with outcast rebellion leaders Mangyi and Mangsoyi, but as the official army continued its campaign against the uprising, Mang brothers revolted again. They were executed in 1177, ending the rebellion; but many other impoverished people continued to revolt against the government. With the law and order crumbling over the whole nation, Jeong decided not to retire from politics even though he was at his late 70's. His son Jeong Gyun, backed by his powerful father, accepted bribes from many officials who tried to gain more power and support from the reigning family; even Jeong's servants and slaves took bribes from politicians and brawled with some of them on the street. Politics drifted toward iniquity, and many people thought another coup d'état was necessary to put an end on Jeong's unjust rule. In the end, General Gyeong Dae-seung, the youngest general of Goryeo army, revolted against Jeong in October 1179, murdering Jeong Gyun and Song Yuin. Jeong Jung-bu was arrested for corruption and treason, and executed in public few days later. ==Popular culture== * Portrayed by Kim Heung-ki in the 2003-2004 KBS TV series Age of Warriors. ==See also== *List of Goryeo people *List of Korea-related topics Category:Goryeo people Category:Korean generals Category:1106 births Category:1179 deaths Category:Deaths by decapitation Category:Leaders who took power by coup Category:Leaders ousted by a coup Category:Korean murder victims Category:Regents of Korea ","title":"Jeong Jung-bu"},{"id":"3236671","text":"The Seal Island Bridge is a bridge located in Victoria County, Nova Scotia. It is the third longest bridge span in the province. It is a through arch design and crosses the Great Bras d'Or channel of Bras d'Or Lake, connecting Boularderie Centre, Boularderie Island on the south side with New Harris, Cape Breton Island on the north side. The Seal Island Bridge ==Construction== Construction of the Seal Island Bridge began in 1960 as part of the Trans- Canada Highway project. The bridge, officially known as the Great Bras d'Or Crossing, was completed in 1961 at a cost of about $4,652,850. The construction of of approach roads increased the total cost of the project to about $6-million. The bridge is a crucial link in the Trans Canada Highway between Sydney and Baddeck, carrying more than 7,500 vehicles a day in peak periods. The structure carries 2 traffic lanes of Highway 105 and was originally constructed with a pedestrian sidewalk on each side. The bridge crosses part of the channel on a causeway connecting the north shore of the channel to Seal Island, a small wooded island. The structure consists of eight steel box truss spans; three simply supported approach spans, two simply- supported splay spans, and a three-span continuous main span that consists of two side spans and a centre arch span. The steel structure is supported on tall reinforced concrete piers, armoured with cut stone at the waterline. The Seal Island Bridge, viewed from the Bras d'Or look off on Kelly's Mountain. ==Closures due to wind== Due to the bridge's height and location in a deep valley that can funnel winds, the Seal Island Bridge occasionally is closed to high-sided vehicles such as transport trucks. There have been a number of incidents on the bridge over the years with winds toppling transport trucks. At times these closures can last for a number of hours, causing traffic to back up. RCMP will stop high-sided vehicles at the bridge and inform they cannot cross. At times as many as 15-20 transport trucks can be lined up, waiting for conditions to improve so they can make the crossing. ==Controversy== The location of the bridge had proven controversial. It replaced two ferry services crossing the Great Bras d'Or; one at the northeastern end between New Campbellton-Big Bras d'Or, and the other at the southwestern end at Big Harbour-Ross Ferry. For political reasons, it was decided to place the bridge halfway between the two ferry services on account of an outcry by communities fearing the loss of their transportation links. Unfortunately to do this required an extensive modification to the Trans- Canada Highway route on the eastern slope of Kelly's Mountain ( high), resulting in a 180° \\"switchback\\". A safer alternative to continue the highway further east on a gradual descent of Kelly's Mountain toward New Campbellton, crossing at the northern end of the Great Bras d'Or channel was rejected. Likewise, a route between Beinn Bhreagh and Kempt Head at the extreme southwestern end of the channel (much wider waterway but avoiding Kelly's Mountain altogether) was never considered. A number of serious accidents have occurred on Kelly's Mountain and at the switchback at the base of the grade over the years, as many as 6 or 7 accidents taking place in some years. The MV Algoport passing under the Seal Island Bridge ==Deck replacement== By 2001 it was found the existing cast-in-place concrete bridge deck was in poor condition. Forty years of wear and tear from traffic, and exposure to wind and salt spray, necessitated a major overhaul of the Seal Island Bridge. The road deck needed complete replacement, and the steel truss work needed reinforcement. Engineers had thoroughly inspected the rest of the bridge structure and found it to be sound and safe. A major deck replacement project was undertaken. Over the next three years the original cast-in-place concrete bridge deck was removed and replaced using full-depth, precast, prestressed, half-deck width concrete panels. It was necessary to complete one lane at a time, starting with the south lane, leaving the other deck in place so the bridge could continue to be used for vehicular traffic. Construction was completed with minimal traffic disruptions and the bridge remained open to single lane traffic throughout construction, with the exception of three, six- hour overnight closures planned per week. This project added several decades to the useful life of the bridge. The new high performance precast concrete deck system is much more durable than conventional systems since it is less permeable and crack-free under service load conditions. The deck system adopted is significantly lighter than a conventional cast-in-place concrete deck system. This has resulted in considerable savings in the amount of truss reinforcement required, while providing sufficient mass and stiffness for damping purposes. At the same time the guard rails (traffic barriers) were replaced over the entire length of the bridge, with the new guard rails set inside the main bridge trusses to better protect them from vehicle impact. Unfortunately this made the new bridge deck too narrow to retain the sidewalks so they were not replaced. This modification did result in wider traffic lanes. The overall cost of the bridge deck reconstruction was $15 million. There are now \\"No pedestrian traffic\\" signs on each end of the bridge. ==Awards== On April 20, 2004 it was announced the Seal Island Bridge Reconstruction Project had won the Lieutenant Governor's Award for Engineering Excellence. The Department of Transportation and Public Works shared the honours with consultants CBCL Limited of Halifax for the major overhaul of the province's third largest bridge. ==References== ==External links== *Structurae: Seal Island Bridge (1961) *Highway Cameras - Seal Island Bridge *Boularderie Island Historical Society - Photos of the Seal Island Bridge Under Construction, 1960 Category:Road bridges in Nova Scotia Category:Transport in Victoria County, Nova Scotia Category:Buildings and structures in Victoria County, Nova Scotia Category:Bridges on the Trans- Canada Highway Category:Bridges completed in 1961 Category:Through arch bridges in Canada ","title":"Seal Island Bridge"},{"id":"3236675","text":"View of Discovery Bay near sunset, looking north with the San Juan Islands in the background Discovery Bay is a small bay connected to the Strait of Juan de Fuca on the Olympic Peninsula in Washington state; it was also historically called Port Discovery. An unincorporated community also named Discovery Bay lies in Jefferson County at the southern end of the bay. The bay was named by George Vancouver after the Discovery, a ship used in his 1792 expedition of the area. The community at the foot of the bay eventually assumed the same name. == Geography == Jefferson County (highlighted) Discovery Bay is located at the northeastern edge of the Olympic Peninsula of Washington state. The bay enters the Strait of Juan de Fuca between the Miller and Quimper peninsulas. The bay's mouth is just south of Protection Island, a small federally protected nature preserve. Discovery Bay is in length, and wide at its mouth. Its primary inlet is Snow Creek at the south end of the bay, and other small watercourses feed the bay on its east and west sides. == Communities == The community of Discovery Bay is an area near the intersection of U.S. Route 101 and State Route 20, at the foot of Discovery Bay - roughly midway between the larger communities of Port Townsend to the northeast and Sequim to the northwest. It is a mix of residential areas and commercial enterprises, including crabbing, oystering, clamming, timbering, security training and gravel extraction. A few restaurants and stores on US 101 near SR 20 primarily serve drivers and truckers along US 101. Discovery Bay is the current name generally associated with the area. Its use for the community, as opposed to the bay itself, is relatively recent. The original communities in the area, primarily mill towns that waxed and waned along with the local timber industry, had different names: * Fairmont is a group of residences at the southeast corner of the bay, off SR 20 just northeast of US 101. * Discovery Junction is an abandoned railroad junction near Fairmont. * Uncas is an old mill community to the southwest of Fairmont, on the south side of US 101. * Fort Discovery is the original location of Capt. Vancouver's camp and the present headquarters of Security Services NW. * Maynard is an old mill community to the north of Uncas, along US 101 at the southwest corner of the bay. An abandoned sawmill just to the east of US 101 is a well-known remnant of this community. The mill has often been incorrectly identified as the 1858 Port Discovery Mill (see Port Discovery, below). It was, in fact, the Maynard Mill. Discovery Bay as seen from Gardiner, Washington, with Diamond Point visible on the left These names often appear on mapse.g. maps.google.com - map of Port Discovery area and persist in local road names. The mill communities no longer have the population or visibility they enjoyed when the mills were operating, making these hamlets primarily matters of local historical interest. However, changing demographics and rising property values are leading to redevelopment of this area, and breathing new life into older names. South Discovery now constitutes the entirety of the area around Discovery Bay, especially the area between Port Discovery and Port Townsend. The South Discovery voting precinct includes areas away from Discovery Bay, as well. Several nearby place names are also prominent in Discovery Bay history: * Eaglemount is an area on the hills to the south of Discovery Bay, on the east of US 101 above high bluffs over Discovery Bay. (Eaglemount is sometimes depicted as a location on SR 20, but in fact it is reached by turning south on Eaglemount Road from SR20.) * Port Discovery is the location of George Vancouver's 1792 visit to Discovery Bay. Many sources incorrectly identify the current Discovery Bay community as the location of Port Discovery; however, Port Discovery was several miles to the north, at Mill Point on the west side of the bay. The site is along US 101, near today's Broders Road.Jefferson County Historical Society archives and publications, Port Townsend Washington There are several other communities located on or near the shores of Discovery Bay. Proceeding clockwise from the northeast corner: * Port Townsend occupies the northern end of the Quimper Peninsula, east of the northeast corner of the bay. The downtown area of Port Townsend, a famous seaport (once the major port of the region, before the rise of Seattle), is on the opposite side of the peninsula. * Cape George is located on high bluffs at the northeast entrance of the bay. * Beckett Point is a shoreline community a mile south of Cape George. * Adelma Beach is a shoreline community halfway down the bay. * Gardiner is an unincorporated community several miles to the west along US 101, established by Herbert Gardner in the late 19th century. (The town name spelling originally matched that of its founder, but was later changed due to a conflict with another Gardner, Washington.) * Diamond Point is located at the northwest mouth of the bay, opposite Protection Island. It once hosted a government quarantine station. ==History== Native people - the Klallam (locally: S'Klallam) - have occupied the lands around the Strait of Juan de Fuca for millennia, including locations on Discovery Bay. Most native populations on the Olympic Peninsula were relocated to reservations during the 19th and early 20th centuries, leaving only scattered individuals of native descent still residing on the bay. The Spanish explorers Manuel Quimper and Gonzalo López de Haro in are the first known Europeans to find and map the bay of Port Discovery. They were sent to explore the Strait of Juan de Fuca by Francisco de Eliza in 1790. The Spanish named the bay Puerto Quadra, after Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra. In 1792, George Vancouver's exploration of the area provided names for Discovery Bay and Port Discovery. A landing party put ashore along the west shore of the bay near what is now Contractor's Point to fill water barrels from the creek there. Today, a sign alongside Highway 101 above the site of the landing commemorates the event. In 1858, the S. L. Mastick Company of San Francisco established the Port Discovery Mill on the western shore of the bay, at what is now Mill Point. The old growth timber on the steep hillsides above the mill were felled, slid down to the sawmill, milled into lumber and loaded from the wharf to ships for other ports. A village grew around the mill to house its employees. The peak population of the community, in the late 19th century, was in the hundreds. Port Discovery remained an important coastal port well into the 20th century, and was visited by many Pacific Ocean vessels. The U.S. Federal Census of 1860 designated Port Discovery as one of three enumeration districts in Jefferson County. The indigenous people were not counted for this census. The total population was 70, and all but one were males between the ages of 20 and 52 years old. The one female was married to a cook, and the only non-white person counted was an African-American male cook. Two-thirds of the population were American-born, all of which had migrated west from other states. Of the third that were foreign-born, all but one were from England, Ireland, Wales, or Canada. The exception was born in Sweden. Another major mill community was established at the foot of the bay, where the town of Maynard grew. The Maynard mill continued in operation until the 1970s, and was responsible for the several nearby small communities mentioned above. The abandoned sawmill was a popular sight for tourists and appears in many nostalgic area photographs and paintings. It deteriorated rapidly during storms in 2005–2006, and as of 2007 had been slated for removal, as part of a habitat restoration effort. ==References== * Jefferson County Historical Society, With Pride in Heritage: History of Jefferson County, Portland, Oregon, Professional Publishing Printing, Inc., 1966. * United States Federal Census of Washington Territory 1860, ProQuest Image Databases, HeritageQuest Online, Series M653, Roll 1398, pp 46–47. ==External links== *Survey of Historic Sites and Buildings - Discovery Bay, Washington, National Park Service * * Category:Unincorporated communities in Washington (state) Category:Unincorporated communities in Jefferson County, Washington Category:Bays of Washington (state) Category:Populated places established in 1858 Category:Bays of Jefferson County, Washington Category:1858 establishments in Washington Territory ","title":"Discovery Bay, Washington"},{"id":"3236676","text":"Catherine Lalumière at WikiStage ESCP Europe Catherine Lalumière (born 3 August 1935, Rennes) is a French politician of the Radical Party of the Left.

The Conservatives swept here in 2004 and the former Canadian Alliance also nearly swept the region in 2000. The rural areas (except for far Northern Saskatchewan) are almost as conservative as their counterparts in Alberta. The far north with its high first nations population has stronger support for the New Democrats and Liberals, and the Liberals were able to pick up the far northern seat in 2006 in a controversial close election. While Saskatoon also has large Liberal support as well as traditional NDP support, this was diluted for much of the early part of the millennium by the riding map. While Saskatoon has double the population of a typical Canadian urban riding, until 2015 the surrounding rural areas were thought to be too thinly populated for ridings of their own. As a result, for almost two decades Saskatoon's four federal ridings included large blocks of rural territory, a major reason why the NDP and Liberals were shut out in Saskatoon from 2000 to 2015. With the 2015 redistribution, Saskatoon is split between three ridings located almost entirely within the city limits. The NDP won one Saskatoon seat in 2015, and also took the far northern seat. Those gains were reversed in 2019, as the massive Conservative wave that swept through Saskatchewan saw the party sweep every seat in the province. ==2015 - 42nd General Election== ==2011 - 41st General Election== ==2008 - 40th General Election== ==2006 - 39th General Election== ==2004 - 38th General Election== Key map #Battlefords—Lloydminster #Blackstrap #Desnethé—Missinippi—Churchill River #Prince Albert #Saskatoon—Humboldt #Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar #Saskatoon—Wanuskewin Image:nskcpc.PNGConservative Party of Canada Image:nskgpc.PNGGreen Party of Canada Image:nsklpc.PNGLiberal Party of Canada Image:nskndp.PNGNew Democratic Party ==2000 - 37th General Election== Saskatchewan, North Category:Elections in Saskatchewan ","title":"Canadian federal election results in Northern Saskatchewan"},{"id":"3236699","text":"Abraham Ellison Garrett (March 6, 1830 – February 14, 1907) was an American politician and a member of the United States House of Representatives from Tennessee. ==Biography== Garrett was born near Livingston, Overton County, Tennessee, on March 6, 1830, son of Stephen and Sarah Flowers Garrett.

Considered a leader of the newly formed team, Addison was selected as team captain, and was named to the AFL All-Star team for four straight years(1961–1964), as well as being one of the first players ever selected to be a Patriot All-League player (in 1960). He was also a Sporting News' All-League player in 1963 and 1964, and an AFL Eastern Division All-Star in 1961 and 1962. With 16 career interceptions (returning one for a touchdown), he was considered by many to be the best AFL linebacker against the run in the mid 1960s. Addison played in every Patriots' game from 1961 to 1966 (84 games), and was adding to this total when he sustained what proved to be a career-ending knee injury. On June 18, 1968, he was released by the Patriots after team doctors stated that he would risk further damage by playing after having undergone two knee operations. Addison was selected by a Patriot fan vote in 1971 as a member of the Patriots' All-1960s (AFL) Team. ==Labor leadership== On January 14, 1964, players in the American Football League formed the AFL Players Association, and Addison was elected the union's first president.\\"Players in A.F.L. Form Own Union.\\" New York Times. January 16, 1964. In search of protection for the players, Addison put together a request package of benefits that included insurance and a player pension plan. As president, Addison had the intimidating task of meeting with the team owners to communicate the request. Upon entering the meeting room, Addison approached the long oval table, where the stern-faced owners were awaiting. With Southern charm, he looked up at the owners, smiled, and said \\"Well, I'm not trying to be the next Jimmy Hoffa!\\" This broke the tension, and started a period of perhaps the most positive relationship between owners and players in team sports history. With a players association in place, players newly drafted by American Football League teams in the \\"war between the leagues\\" could be assured that they would have representation and protection in the AFL that was the equal of that in the older league. Addison's work was an important element in the survival of the league, and helped the AFL to be able to compete for top talent, and to establish itself as the future of Professional Football. ==See also== * List of American Football League players ==References== Category:1936 births Category:2011 deaths Category:People from Lancaster, South Carolina Category:People from Bluffton, South Carolina Category:Players of American football from South Carolina Category:American football linebackers Category:South Carolina Gamecocks football players Category:Boston Patriots players Category:American Football League players Category:American Football League All-Star players Category:American Football League All-League players Category:Leaders of American trade unions ","title":"Tom Addison"},{"id":"3236722","text":"William Amory Underhill (February 21, 1910 - September 7, 1999) was a public servant, lobbyist, and philanthropist prominent in his native Florida and in Washington, D.C..

The dividing line embattled stands for the entrenchments which the regiment has so many times assaulted. The Mohawk arrowhead was the regimental insignia during World War I. It was selected by Colonel Hamilton A. Smith as indicating the American virtues and the regimental spirit of courage, resourceful daring and relentless pursuit of an enemy. Colonel Smith was killed while leading the regiment in the first great offensive in which it took part. The arrow is repeated five times because in five major offensives the regiment exhibited these qualities indicated by the badge which it had adopted and by which it was designated during these engagements. The palm of victory displayed on the shield and the motto refer to the only award the regiment seeks. The arrowhead is repeated in the crest to indicate the same regimental spirit under all conditions. The sun, taken from the Katipunan flag, symbolizes service in the Philippine Insurrection. * Background: The coat of arms was approved on 1973-04-16. ===Distinctive unit insignia=== * Description: The distinctive unit insignia is a gold color metal and enamel device 1 1/8 inches (2.86 cm) in height overall, consisting of a white enamel shield charged with a blue enamel Indian arrowhead point to chief. * Symbolism: The shield is the characteristic device of the regiment. * Background: The distinctive unit insignia was approved on 1973-04-16. ===Background Trimmings=== * Description: A white oval-shaped embroidered item 1 3/8 inches (3.49 cm) in height and 2 1/4 inches (5.72 cm) in width overall, all within a 1/4 (3.18 cm) ultramarine blue border notched at the horizontal center line. * The background trimming was approved on 24 October 2014. ==History== At the beginning of the 20th century, the United States Army was sorely pressed to meet its overseas commitments in Cuba, the Philippines, and Puerto Rico. As a result, in 1901 Congress authorized five additional Regular Army infantry regiments; the 26th, 27th, 28th, 29th, and 30th Infantry. (These regiments should not be confused with United States volunteer regiments with the same numerical designations which served from 1899 to 1901.) ===Philippines=== The 26th Infantry began its life overseas in the Philippines and spent its first 20 years of service on deployments to the Southwest Pacific, the Mexican and Indian frontier and in Europe. It earned its first battle streamer during the Philippine–American War within two years of its forming as a unit. ===World War I=== After returning to the same location for another tour of duty (a habit the Blue Spaders would keep for the entire century), the regiment fought off Mexican bandits and settled disputes in the Indian Territory, until it was selected as one of only four Regular Army infantry regiments deemed fit for immediate combat to form the first American Expeditionary Division in June 1917. This expeditionary division would later be renamed the First Division and thus began the regiment's long association with the \\"Big Red One\\". As part of the first American soldiers to arrive in France, the regiment immediately left for the front. Along with its sister regiments of the division, it earned more campaign streamers than any other regiments during World War I. However, they came at a terrible cost. Over 900 Blue Spaders lost their lives in a six-month period. At Soissons alone, the regimental commander, executive officer, two of three battalion commanders and the regimental sergeant major were killed in action; sixty-two officers were killed or wounded; and of the 3,100 Blue Spaders that started the attack, over 1,500 had been killed or wounded. But the battle was won and this turned the tide for the Allies at a crucial period during the summer of 1918. By the war's end, the soldiers had earned seven battle streamers and two foreign awards. Following brief occupation duty in Germany, the regiment returned to the United States and served as a part of the smaller peacetime Army. ===World War II=== The 1st Battalion, 26th Infantry passing through the railway viaduct north of Bütgenbach, Belgium, on the Monschauer St. (N647) towards Bütgenbach. The railway viaduct was part of the line running from Losheim/Eifel (Germany) to Trois-Ponts, Belgium, and had been blown up by the retreating German troops. In 1941, the regiment once again stood with its sister regiments and prepared for war in Europe. The regiment was assigned to the 1st Infantry Division for the duration of World War II. In World War II, the 26th Infantry led America's first-ever amphibious assault in North Africa, fought at the Kasserine Pass, assaulted Sicily at the Amphibious Battle of Gela, invaded Normandy, conquered the first German city of the war at Aachen, vaulted the Rhine and attacked all the way to Czechoslovakia by war's end. The regiment, commanded by Colonel John F. R. Seitz, conducted three amphibious assaults, and earned seven battle streamers, a Presidential Unit Citation, and five foreign awards. Beginning another occupation of Germany, the Blue Spaders bore the United States national colors at the Allied Victory in Europe parade, and served as guards at Nuremberg War Crimes Trials. Thus began a lengthy stay in Germany, first as conquerors and later as friends and allies. Called again to serve in the United States after a reorganization of the army, the unit was redesignated 1st Battalion, 26th Infantry and had a very short stay in the United States. ===Cold War=== In February 1963 2nd Battle Group, 26th Infantry was activated (with assets of 1st Battle Group, 5th Infantry) & assigned to 1st Infantry Division at Ft. Riley, Kansas. 2nd Battle Group, 26th Infantry participated in Operation Long Thrust VII, reinforcing U.S. Berlin Brigade summer & autumn 1963 before redeploying to Ft. Riley where it was inactivated in January 1964. ===Vietnam War=== After serving as a battle group in Europe in the early 1960s, the battalion rejoined the 1st Infantry Division shortly before receiving orders to deploy as a part of the Army's first divisional- sized unit in Vietnam in 1965. The Blue Spaders served longer in Vietnam with their Big Red One units than any other division. After five continuous years of combat, the Blue Spaders received orders to return home in 1970 with eleven battle streamers, a Valorous Unit Award and two foreign awards for its colors. ===Service in Germany=== At the conclusion of Vietnam, the battalion returned to Germany as part of a forward-deployed brigade of the Big Red One. ===Training recruits=== The 26th Infantry was reassigned to TRADOC in April 1987. All three Spader battalions spent several years training recruits at Fort Dix, New Jersey and Fort Jackson, South Carolina, until reassigned to the First Infantry Division in January 1996. ===Balkan Wars=== In 1996, the battalion rejoined the Big Red One in Germany only to send its soldiers to Bosnia as part of the first American forces to enter the Balkans from February to September 1996. The entire battalion followed its initial deployment from October 1996 to April 1997. In March 1998, the unit deployed to the Balkans, this time to the Republic of Macedonia. Returning briefly in September 1998, the battalion was one of the first unit alerted for deployment to Kosovo in June 1999. It returned in December 1999. During this period, the unit earned the Superior Unit Award streamer and the Defense of Kosovo streamer. Three of the Task Force 1-26 Infantry soldiers lost their lives in Kosovo. PFC McGill.

The battalion returned to Schweinfurt, Germany in February 2005. * Operation Iraqi Freedom 06-08 Soldiers from C Company, 1st Battalion, 26th Infantry Regiment, conduct a Cordon and Search operation in Al Adhamiya, Baghdad, Iraq, Feb. 21, 2007. On 5 August 2006 Task Force \\"Blue Spader\\" deployed to Eastern Baghdad. The battalion's B Company was cross attached to TF 1-77 Armor, in return TF 1-26 Infantry received B Company, 1-77 Armor, B Company, 9th Engineers, a fire support team from 1-7 Field Artillery, and a maintenance support team from 299th Forward Support Battalion. Task Force 1-26 Infantry operated as the primary maneuver element in the Eastern Baghdad area. The unit returned to Schweinfurt, Germany, in December 2007. Thirty-one soldiers from the battalion lost their lives during the deployment. * Operation Enduring Freedom In July 2008 the battalion deployed to Kunar Province of Afghanistan. Most of the unit was scattered in small combat outposts throughout the province to include the Kunar Valley, Pech Valley, Watapor Valley, Chapadara, and the Korengal Valley. The unit fell under CJTF-101 and later CJTF-82 during OEF 8 and 9. The unit returned to Fort Hood, Texas in July 2009. They were quickly moved again from Fort Hood, Texas to Fort Knox, Kentucky, having only months to get ready for another deployment in January 2011. ==Medal of Honor recipients== *Private James W. Reese. World War II. On 5 August 1943, at Mt. Vassillio, Sicily, for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of life. above and beyond the call of duty in action involving actual conflict with the enemy. When the enemy launched a counterattack which threatened the position of his company, Pvt. Reese, as the acting squad leader of a 60-mm. mortar squad, displaying superior leadership on his own initiative, maneuvered his squad forward to a favorable position, from which, by skillfully directing the fire of his weapon, he caused many casualties in the enemy ranks, and aided materially in repulsing the counterattack. When the enemy fire became so severe as to make his position untenable, he ordered the other members of his squad to withdraw to a safer position, but declined to seek safety for himself. So as to bring more effective fire upon the enemy, Pvt. Reese, without assistance, moved his mortar to a new position and attacked an enemy machinegun nest. He had only 3 rounds of ammunition but secured a direct hit with his last round, completely destroying the nest and killing the occupants. Ammunition being exhausted, he abandoned the mortar. seized a rifle and continued to advance, moving into an exposed position overlooking the enemy. Despite a heavy concentration of machinegun, mortar, and artillery fire, the heaviest experienced by his unit throughout the entire Sicilian campaign, he remained at this position and continued to inflict casualties upon the enemy until he was killed. His bravery, coupled with his gallant and unswerving determination to close with the enemy, regardless of consequences and obstacles which he faced, are a priceless inspiration to our armed forces. *Sergeant Francis X. McGraw. World War II. On 19 November 1944, near Schevenhutte, Germany, while serving with Company H, He manned a heavy machinegun emplaced in a foxhole near Schevenhutte, Germany, on 19 November 1944, when the enemy launched a fierce counterattack. Braving an intense hour-long preparatory barrage, he maintained his stand and poured deadly accurate fire into the advancing foot troops until they faltered and came to a halt. The hostile forces brought up a machinegun in an effort to dislodge him but were frustrated when he lifted his gun to an exposed but advantageous position atop a log, courageously stood up in his foxhole and knocked out the enemy weapon. A rocket blasted his gun from position, but he retrieved it and continued firing. He silenced a second machinegun and then made repeated trips over fire-swept terrain to replenish his ammunition supply. Wounded painfully in this dangerous task, he disregarded his injury and hurried back to his post, where his weapon was showered with mud when another rocket barely missed him. In the midst of the battle, with enemy troops taking advantage of his predicament to press forward, he calmly cleaned his gun, put it back into action and drove off the attackers. He continued to fire until his ammunition was expended, when, with a fierce desire to close with the enemy, he picked up a carbine, killed 1 enemy soldier, wounded another and engaged in a desperate firefight with a third until he was mortally wounded by a burst from a machine pistol. The extraordinary heroism and intrepidity displayed by Pvt. McGraw inspired his comrades to great efforts and was a major factor in repulsing the enemy attack. *Corporal Henry F. Warner. World War II. 20–21 December 1944, near Dom Butgenbach, Belgium, while assigned to the 2d Battalion Anti-Tank Company, he was a major factor in stopping enemy tanks during heavy attacks against the battalion position. Disregarding the concentrated cannon and machinegun fire from 2 tanks bearing down on him, and ignoring the imminent danger of being overrun by the infantry moving under tank cover, he destroyed the first tank and scored a direct and deadly hit upon the second. A third tank approached to within 5 yards of his position while he was attempting to clear a jammed breach lock. Jumping from his gun pit, he engaged in a pistol duel with the tank commander standing in the turret, killing him and forcing the tank to withdraw. Following a day and night during which our forces were subjected to constant shelling, mortar barrages, and numerous unsuccessful infantry attacks, the enemy struck in great force on the early morning of the 21st. Seeing a Mark IV tank looming out of the mist and heading toward his position, Cpl. Warner scored a direct hit. Disregarding his injuries, he endeavored to finish the loading and again fire at the tank whose motor was now aflame, when a second machinegun burst killed him. Cpl. Warner's gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of life above and beyond the call of duty contributed materially to the successful defense against the enemy attacks. *Specialist Robert F. Stryker. Vietnam War. 7 November 1967, while assigned to C Company, 1st Battalion, 26th Infantry Regiment, SP4 Robert F. Stryker threw himself upon an enemy Claymore mine as it was detonated near Loc Ninh, Republic of Vietnam. He was mortally wounded as his body absorbed the blast and shielded his comrades from the explosion.

It is a myrmecophyte, a plant that lives in ecological mutualism with ants. This plant and three or four other closely related species are known collectively as ant plants or ant pipers. This species has broad, bright green leaves and grows in dim, swampy areas deep in the rainforest of Costa Rica and surrounding countries. This ant piper has hollow petioles which provide a home for ants, especially of the species Pheidole bicornis. The plant also produces food bodies that the ants use as their main food source. The ants in turn defend the plant against predation by herbivorous caterpillars and fungi. Adding to the complexity of this food web is the beetle Tarsobaenus letourneauae, a specialized predator which lives in the plant's petioles and feeds upon the ants and their eggs. This food web is an example of ecological top-down control, in which the top predator affects lower levels of the system. The beetle reduces the number of ants, which allows more herbivory to occur, causing foliage loss on the plant. ==References== cenocladum Category:Myrmecophytes Category:Taxa named by Casimir de Candolle ","title":"Piper cenocladum"},{"id":"3236755","text":"Elwha is an unincorporated community in Clallam County, Washington, United States.

It eliminates the possibility of a leftover charge causing electric shock if people handle or service the equipment in the off state, believing it is safe. A bleeder resistor is usually a standard resistor rather than a specialized component. ==Usage== ===DC power supplies=== The power supply circuits in electronic equipment that produce direct current (DC) needed by the device from the alternating current (AC) supplied by mains use filter capacitors to smooth the DC current. A large electric charge can remain in these capacitors after the unit is turned off, constituting a shock hazard. For example switching mode power supplies use a bridge rectifier to convert mains AC power into DC at 320 V (for 220 V mains) or 160 V (for 115 V. mains), before the voltage is reduced by the chopper. These incorporate one or more filter capacitors to smooth the pulsing output voltage from the rectifier. These must typically store enough energy at this high voltage to power the load during the zero crossings of the AC input. In addition, the capacitors in many supplies are made large enough to supply the load during AC outages lasting for a significant fraction of a second. This stored charge is often enough to deliver a lethal shock. The capacitors in high voltage DC power supplies used in devices such as lasers, x-ray machines, radio transmitters and old style CRT computer monitors and televisions can have higher, more dangerous voltages. This stored charge can remain in the capacitors for a long time after the unit has been turned off. It can be a potentially lethal shock hazard for the user or maintenance and servicing personnel, who may believe that because the device is turned off or unplugged it is safe. Therefore, to discharge the capacitor after the supply has been turned off, a large-value resistor is connected across its terminals. After it is switched off, the charge on the capacitor will drain off through this \\"bleeder resistor\\", causing the voltage to decay quickly to safe levels. While the power supply is on, a small current flows through the bleeder resistor, wasting a small amount of power. The value of the resistor is chosen to be low enough that the charge on the capacitor bleeds off quickly, but high enough that the resistor will not consume too much power while the supply is on. ===High voltage supply in television sets=== The high voltage power supplies of CRT type television sets and computer monitors generate voltages of 30 - 40 kV, which are a much greater electrocution hazard. This higher voltage requires higher value bleeder resistors to avoid unnecessarily loading the supply circuits. The bleeder resistor commonly found inside a flyback transformer is valued in the hundreds of megohms range, and can therefore not be measured with the common technician's multimeter. Instead of a resistor inside the transformer, the focus and screen control array may be used for the same purpose, depending on the application and tolerances of the type of tube it is producing output for. These bleeders discharge the focus supply, but not the high voltage final anode feed. The CRT itself forms a capacitor that can hold a sizable (and very dangerous) high voltage charge, so it is always advisable to momentarily ground a CRT's high voltage terminal before working on the unit. ==Design considerations== There is always a trade-off between the speed with which the bleeder operates and the amount of power wasted in the bleeder; a lower resistance value results in a faster bleed-down rate but wastes more power during normal, power-on operation. The presence of a bleeder also guarantees a minimum load on the power source, which can help reduce the range of voltage change (regulation) when the normal load is changing and there is no active regulator. Use of a bleeder this way is a common design strategy for power supplies of vacuum tube power amplifiers, for instance. Large capacitors can actually recover a substantial part of their charge after being discharged by the bleeder resistor, if the resistor is not left in place. This is due to a property called dielectric absorption, in which energy stored in the dielectric during use is released gradually over time. Therefore the bleeder should ideally be connected permanently. ==Failure== The failure of a bleeder resistor prevents the discharge of the capacitors, resulting in dangerous voltages being retained for many days. This is one of several reasons for the typical warning on most equipment: \\"Warning - No user- serviceable parts inside\\". An un-suspecting user may get an electrical shock from opened equipment due to failure of a bleeder resistor, or the common practice of not fitting them, long after the device has been turned off or unplugged. Safe design suggests mounting a bleeder close to a dangerous capacitor, ideally directly to the capacitor terminals, and not through any connectors, so that it is difficult to disconnect the bleeder accidentally. Despite the presence of a bleeder, it is wise to prove that any potentially dangerous capacitors are discharged, perhaps by shorting their terminals (or through a suitable low resistance for high energy capacitors), before working on any circuit. ==Dual bleeder== Because of the speed/power tradeoff, high- powered circuits may use two separate bleeder circuits. A fast bleed circuit is switched out during normal operation so that no power is wasted; when power is switched off, the fast bleeder is connected, rapidly bleeding down the voltage. The switch controlling the fast bleeder can fail, either by connecting when it shouldn't (and overheating) or by not connecting when it should (and thereby failing to bleed off the voltage quickly). To avoid the risk of not having an operational bleeder, a secondary, slower (and less lossy) bleeder is usually permanently connected so that there is always some bleed-down capability.

The only examples to have been built were airships, although airborne aircraft carriers of various types appear in fiction, such as Cloudbase in Gerry Anderson's Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons, the helicarrier from Marvel Comics, the Valiant from series 3 of Doctor Who, and an unnamed one in Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow. ==Airship projects== In July 1917, experiments were made with aircraft slung under HM Airship No. 23, in hopes that they could defend the airship. First an unmanned, then a manned, Sopwith Camel fighters were launched successfully. The experiment was successfully completed with two other manned Camels. The British Imperial Airship Scheme of 1924 initially envisaged an airship that could carry five fighter aircraft in military use, but this requirement was abandoned and the project saw only the civilian R100 and R101 airships to completion. ==Akron-class== Akron in flight, November 1931 A Consolidated N2Y launches from its trapeze beneath Akron The two rigid airships of the , and , were built for scouting duties for the U.S. Navy and operational between 1931 and 1935. Following experiments with launching and recovering small aeroplanes using , the U.S. Navy designed Akron and Macon with internal hangars able to house a number of Curtiss F9C Sparrowhawk biplane fighters. The fighters were launched and recovered using a \\"trapeze\\" mechanism. With lengths of , Akron and Macon were among the largest flying objects in the world and still hold the world record for helium-filled airships. They were just shorter than the German hydrogen-filled airship Hindenburg. Akron first flew on 8 August 1931 and Macon followed on 21 April 1933. The Sparrowhawk fighters became operational in September 1932. Akron was destroyed on 4 April 1933 and Macon on 12 February 1935. During her accident- prone 18-month term of service, the Akron served as an airborne aircraft carrier for launching and recovering F9C Sparrowhawk fighter planes. Akron was destroyed in a thunderstorm off the coast of New Jersey on the morning of 4 April 1933, killing 73 of her 76 crewmen and passengers. This accident was the largest loss of life for any airship crash. Macon was designed to carry biplane parasite aircraft, five single-seat Curtiss F9C Sparrowhawks for scouting or two-seat Fleet N2Y-1 for training. In service for less than two years, in 1935 Macon was damaged in a storm and lost off California's Big Sur coast, though most of the crew were saved. The wreckage is listed as \\"USS Macon Airship Remains\\" on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. ==Lockheed CL-1201== The Lockheed CL-1201 was a study for a giant atomic- powered transport aeroplane. Having a wing span of , one variant studied was an airborne aircraft carrier with a complement of up to 22 fighter aircraft carried under its wings. == Convair B-36 Peacemaker== The B-36 Peacemaker strategic bomber was at one point intended to function as an airborne aircraft carrier for up to four McDonnell F-85 Goblin parasite fighters. Operational F-85-carrying B-36s were to have been capable of refueling and rearming their fighters in flight, while deploying and recovering them on a trapeze-like structure similar to that of the Akron and the Macon. No B-36 was ever equipped to carry the F-85, however, and the two prototypes only flew from a single modified B-29. ==Boeing 747 Airborne Aircraft Carrier== alt=Silhouette diagram of 747 airborne aircraft carrier aircraft In the early 1970s, Boeing conducted a study under a contract from the USAF for an airborne aircraft carrier for up to 10 Boeing Model 985-121 \\"microfighters\\", with the ability to launch, retrieve, re-arm, and refuel the microfighters. Boeing believed that the scheme would be able to deliver a flexible and fast carrier platform with global reach, particularly where other bases were not available. Modified versions of the 747-200 and Lockheed C-5A were considered as the base aircraft. The concept, which included a complementary 747 AWACS version with two reconnaissance \\"microfighters\\", was considered technically feasible in 1973. ==Lockheed C-130 Hercules== Since 2015, the United States Department of Defense has been investigating the prospect of deploying Dynetics X-61 Gremlins unmanned aerial vehicles from modified Lockheed C-130 Hercules cargo aircraft. The plane will be able to deploy, support and recover drones. After completing their mission, the X-61A will deploy a parachute and be snatched out of the air by modified transport airplane. ==See also== * Aircraft carrier * Aircraft cruiser * Helicopter carrier * Submarine aircraft carrier * Composite aircraft * McDonnell XF-85 Goblin * List of fictional airborne aircraft carriers ==References== ==External links== ","title":"Airborne aircraft carrier"},{"id":"3236785","text":"Travon Levar Bryant (born February 5, 1983), nicknamed T, is an American former professional basketball player who currently works as an assistant coach working with player development for the Brooklyn Nets of the National Basketball Association (NBA).

(Additionally, part of Clallam County located along the Jefferson County line adjacent to Gardiner is often referred to as being part of Gardiner.) Gardiner is located on the Miller Peninsula, at the northern coast of the Olympic Peninsula on Discovery Bay, which enters the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Gardiner is primarily a rural- residential community, with mostly five- and parcels, plus several large landholders. Gardiner also has a few retail establishments, a community center, and a church, all located on U.S. Route 101. There is still some farming, lumbering, and fishing, but the area is following the Jefferson County trend away from agriculture, as old homesteads and family farms get subdivided into residences. Annual Salmon Derby Gardiner has a public boat ramp that provides access to Discovery Bay; the ramp is maintained by the Port of Port Townsend. Popular salmon fishing derbies are held here each February; in the 2011 event, 760 ticket holders fished in an area spanning 500 square miles.GardinerSalmonDerby.org The community has roughly 300 people, and is located east of Sequim, just north of U.S. Route 101. (Port Townsend is just a bit further, in the opposite direction.) Timber in the area was originally cleared in the late 19th century, as was much of Discovery Bay, and was planted with fruit trees - primarily apples and pears. Gardiner took the name of the original farmer, Herbert Gardner.Jefferson County Historical Society archives and publications, Port Townsend, Washington The spelling was eventually changed to its current form, due to a conflict with another Gardner, Washington; this was needed to enable mail delivery. (However, Gardiner lost its post office in the 1990s, when Gardiner residents were given mailing addresses in Sequim, Washington. The two towns are in different counties, which leads to confusion.) ==References== Category:Unincorporated communities in Washington (state) Category:Unincorporated communities in Jefferson County, Washington ","title":"Gardiner, Washington"},{"id":"3236800","text":"\\"DINK\\" is an acronym that stands for \\"double income, no kids\\". It describes a childfree couple living together while both partners are receiving an income; because both of their wages are coming into the same household, they are free to live more comfortably than couples who live together and spend their money on raising their children. The term was coined at the height of yuppie culture in the 1980s.

The band made its debut with the single \\"Tokyo\\". They released nine singles and five albums before their disbandment in 2003. In 2010, Sads reformed with a more hard rock/heavy metal sound and signed to the Avex label. They have since released two albums and one single. ==History== Sads was formed by Kiyoharu, vocalist of the disbanded Kuroyume, in May 1999 and at the same time formed his own record label \\"Full Face\\". Their first live tour was held in the United Kingdom. Kiyoharu has said that the decision to tour internationally from the very beginning was to test Sads' ability to \\"compete worldwide\\". Their first album, Sad Blood Rock'n'Roll, was a continuation of the bare-bones punk and garage rock from the last Kuroyume album, Corkscrew. Sads eventually delved more into glam rock and post-punk territory as their releases progressed. In early 2010, Kiyoharu announced that Sads and Kuroyume would be resuming activities again, though the other original members of Sads would not be returning; instead, the band now included K-A-Z, the guitarist of the band Detrox, Keisuke Kubota, support bassist for the band 30size, and Go, leader and drummer of the band Suns Owl.

It was first published in 1986. The title of the book is taken from the first essay in the volume, in which Fulghum lists lessons normally learned in American kindergarten classrooms and explains how the world would be improved if adults adhered to the same basic rules as children, i.e. sharing, being kind to one another, cleaning up after themselves, and living \\"a balanced life\\" of work, play, and learning. The book contains fifty short essays, ranging in length from approximately 200 to 1,000 words, which are ruminations on topics ranging from surprises, holidays, childhood, death, and the lives of interesting people including Mother Teresa. In his introduction, Fulghum describes these as having been \\"written over many years and addressed to friends, family, a religious community, and myself, with no thought of publication in book form.\\" ==Reception== Although widely published, quoted and cited in other essays, Fulghum's essays (especially the title piece) have also been criticized as trite and saccharine. Fulghum addresses this in an essay in his subsequent book, It Was on Fire When I Lay Down on It wherein he mentions \\"grown-up\\" subjects such as sexuality. ==Musical adaptation== Fulghum worked with Ernie Zulia (director) and David Caldwell (composer and music director) to create a musical based on Kindergarten, bearing the same title. It was premiered at Mill Mountain Theatre (Roanoke, VA) in June 1992, and was also presented by the Phoenix Theatre (Indianapolis) in 1996. The same personnel also created another musical production of the third book in his trilogy, Uh Oh, called Uh Oh, Here Comes Christmas, which also premiered at Mill Mountain Theater, in December 1998. ==Cultural influence== Over nearly two decades, the title essay, \\"All I Really Need To Know I Learned in Kindergarten\\", has spawned countless parodies involving television shows, movies, books, and other phenomena.E.g. All I Really Need to Know I Learned from Watching Star Trek The standard format mirrors Fulghum's own work, starting with \\"All I Really Need To Know I Learned From [name]\\", followed by a list of quotes and/or in-jokes from the subject being parodied. Bart Simpson's chalkboard gag in \\"You Only Move Twice\\" is \\"I did not learn everything I need to know in kindergarten.\\" Fulghum was a member of the Rock Bottom Remainders, a rock and roll music group of authors whose members also included Simpsons co-creator Matt Groening, and author Stephen King. ==References== * All I Really Need To Know I Learned in Kindergarten, Robert Fulghum.

Eganville lies within the township of Bonnechere Valley. Eganville is also known as the Ordovician Fossil Capital of Canada. There are many fossils to be found in this area from approximately 500 million years ago (in a time before dinosaurs) including coral, crinoids, trilobites, cephalopods, gastropods, pelecypods, stromatolites, and brachiopods. The Bonnechere Valley is also a gateway to some of north-eastern Ontario's most well-known tourist destinations, including the nearby Bonnechere Caves. The caves are located under a hill of limestone, said by geologists to have been the bottom of a tropical sea 500 million years ago. The Bonnechere Museum, through a partnership with the Bonnechere Caves, offers fossil hunts four times in a summer season where people can practice finding fossils and even take one home if they find a good one. Eganville is also home to a Geo-Heritage Walking Trail located along the Bonnechere River which features a fossil pit, a visit to an old quarry, a trench, wild plants, and scenic lookouts. Eganville is a stop to destinations into central Ontario. Ontario Highway 41, which runs north–south from Pembroke to Napanee, intersects with Ontario Highway 60 in Eganville. ==History== The first settler in Eganville was Gregoire Belanger in 1825. He built the first lumber shanty on the Bonnechere River. He then sold the area to James Wadsworth in 1826 who called it \\"New Fairfield Farm\\". Wadsworth then sold the area to Eganville's name-sake John Egan who was both a lumberman and a politician. The power of the river has been harnessed since 1848 but it was John Egan's grist mill that is credited for stimulating the town's growth. After his death in 1857 (at the age of 46) his family ran the business for ten years before selling to James Bonfield and Robert Turner. Eganville's post office dates from 1852. In 1911, a major fire destroyed many of the buildings in Eganville. Some 75 homes were lost along with schools, churches and industries along both sides on the Bonnechere River. A year later, the village post office was erected and used for almost a century. It was then used as the Municipal building. This building has since become the home of the Bonnechere Museum and is one of the best-known symbols of Eganville. Eganville was incorporated as a Village in the 1890s and remained an independent municipality until it was amalgamated with the Townships of Grattan, Sebastopol and South Algona to form the Township of Bonnechere Valley in 2001. ==Notable people== Eganville is the home of Fr Michael O'Neill, Catholic priest and pastor of St George's Church in Ottawa from 1933 to 1945. He died in 1951 and was buried in St James Parish cemetery in Eganville.St James Parish cemetery Ice hockey players Dale McTavish and Shawn Heins and Olympian Melissa Bishop were born in Eganville. ==References== ==External links== * The Township of Bonnechere Valley official website Category:Communities in Renfrew County Category:Former villages in Ontario ","title":"Eganville, Ontario"},{"id":"3236842","text":"Kenne Duncan (February 17, 1903 - February 5, 1972) was a Canadian-born B-movie character actor. Hyped professionally as \\"The Meanest Man in the Movies,\\" the vast majority of his over 250 appearances on camera were Westerns, but he also did occasional forays into horror, crime drama, and science fiction. He also appeared in over a dozen serials. ==Early years== Duncan was born Kenneth Duncan MacLachlan in Ontario, Canada. Before he became an actor, Duncan enjoyed riding, and for a time he worked as a jockey. His accomplishments in that field included winning the steeplechase at Blue Bonnets raceway in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. == Career == Duncan is best known, in some circles, for his work with Ed Wood. Duncan appeared in five Wood productions: Night of the Ghouls, Trick Shooting with Kenne Duncan, Crossroad Avenger, The Sinister Urge, and The Lawless Rider, a film Wood did with Yakima Canutt in the Director's chair. Duncan's final appearances on screen were Wood's low-budget The Sinister Urge, and a bit part in an episode of Rawhide (\\"Incident of the Sharpshooter\\"). He also made television appearances, especially westerns, such as The Cisco Kid, The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp, and Tombstone Territory. He had a reputation for being a womanizer with his female co-stars, according to actress Valda Hansen. ==Death== On February 5, 1972, Duncan committed suicide by overdosing on barbiturates at the age of 68. He was buried at Grand View Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California. ==Selected filmography== * Police Reporter (1928) * A Man from Wyoming (1930) - Haley (uncredited) * Derelict (1930) - Radio Man (uncredited) * No Limit (1931) - Curly Andrews * Grief Street (1931) - Newspaper Reporter (uncredited) * Lovers Courageous (1932) - Cowboy (uncredited) * Probation (1932) - Wedding Rehearsal Attendant (uncredited) * The Mouthpiece (1932) - Office Worker (uncredited) * Shadow River (1933) * Undercover Men (1934) - Blake Hardy * Gallant Defender (1935) - Goose Neck Smith (uncredited) * From Nine to Nine (1936) - John Sommerset * Thoroughbred (1936) - Chick Williams * Cross My Heart (1937) - Steve King * Make-Up (1937) - Lorenzo * The Last Curtain (1937) - Garsatti * The Colorado Kid (1937) - Sims Leather * Flash Gordon's Trip to Mars (1938, Serial) - Airdrome Captain * The Great Adventures of Wild Bill Hickok (1938, Serial) - Blacksmith (Ch.13) (uncredited) * Frontier Scout (1938) - Crandall - Henchman * The Spider's Web (1938, Serial) - Ram Singh * Fighting Thoroughbreds (1939) - Brady * North of the Yukon (1939) - Henchman Meeker * Buck Rogers (1939, Serial) - Lieutenant Lacy * The Man from Texas (1939) - Speed Dennison * Mickey the Kid (1939) - Henchman (uncredited) * Overland with Kit Carson (1939, Serial) - Trapper (uncredited) * The Fighting Renegade (1939) - Henchman (uncredited) * Trigger Fingers (1939) - Henchman Johnson * Flaming Lead (1939) - Larry - Ranch Hand * Westbound Stage (1939) - Capt.

Lake Ulungur is divided into two sections, often viewed as to separate lakes: the Buluntuo Lake (or the Ulungur Lake proper) and the smaller Jili Lake (吉力湖, ), connected by a narrow channel. The main affluent of the Ulungur-Jili system is the Ulungur River; presently, its main channel enters the Jili Lake at around . Between 1960 and 1987, the lake level dropped by 4.2 m, due to the increasing use of the river water for irrigation and other needs. To alleviate this problem, in 1987 a canal was built through the narrow isthmus between Lake Ulungur and the Irtysh River, diverting some of the Irtysh water into the lake.

The population in the Santa Cruz Department in Bolivia was split off as a separate species, the Bolivian red howler, in 1986, and more recently, splitting off the population in northeastern South America and Trinidad as the Guyanan red howler has occurred. All howler monkeys belong to the family Atelidae and the infraorder Platyrrhini (New World monkeys). ==Description== Skull of Alouatta seniculus. Sexual dimorphism in this species is small; males range from 49 to 72 cm and females from 46 to 57 cm long. The males weigh 5.4-9 kg, while females weigh 4.2–7 kg. It has a long prehensile tail of 49–75 cm. The tail is covered with fur except for the last third of the underside, which allows it to grab branches. The color of both males and females is a deep reddish-brown, and the color shade changes with age. Their faces are surrounded by fur and they have stubby noses. The jawbone of the red howler monkey is large, especially the body of the mandible. The position of the foramen magnum is very posterior to make way for the expanded jaw and enlarged hyoid bone. Howler monkeys also have an inflated bulla, which is the bony encasement of the middle ear. This makes them an exception among other New World monkeys. The diurnal Alouatta seniculus is an arboreal primate, so it spends much of its time high in the canopy. Its preferred method of locomotion is quadrupedal walking with minimal leaping. Its long, prehensile tail also assists it by providing both support and grasping abilities. In addition, its hands and feet have a grasping pattern that allows it to better move about in the trees. This can be seen by the wide separation of the second and third digits of the hand. ==Social interactions== It lives in groups of three to 9 individuals (usually five to seven). The groups are polygynous, with only one or two males and the rest females and their offspring. One male is the usually dominant monkey of the group, the alpha male, and he is responsible for leading them to new food sites and defending them. The females of the group are in charge of the offspring. Venezuelan red howlers are most active in the morning, when the group is on the move to find another feeding spot. These howlers are famous for their “dawn chorus”. These roaring and howling calls are performed mostly by the males in the group. The roars can be heard up to 5 km away in the forest, and make their presence known in the area. This is also used to prevent confrontations between groups, which will prevent energy loss by avoiding physical fighting. Because of their low-sugar diets, conservation of energy is key. The calls also help in the scattering of the groups and lessens the competition over food. ==Diet and dentition== A. seniculus monkeys are folivores, which means their diets mainly consist of leaves, but they also rely on nuts, small animals, fruits, seeds, and flowers for important nutrients. These foods provide sugar necessary for growth and energy. The most important part of their diets is leaves, which they cannot live without for more than a week. They eat both older and younger leaves; however, the older leaves provide more nutrition. These howler monkeys are able to eat the fibrous leaves due to the structural aspects of their dentition. Narrow incisors aid in the ingestion of the leaves, and molars with sharp, shearing crests help them to better chew their food. In addition, they have complex stomachs to aid in the digestive process. Their hindguts and large intestines also help with digestion. The hindgut contains bacteria that digest leaves and makes up a third of the Venezuelan red howler's total body volume. Like other New World monkeys, the Venezuelan red howler's dental formula (maxilla and mandible) is two incisors, one canine, three premolars, and three molars. ==Reproduction== The fierce sexual competition between males is due to an unbalanced sex ratio. A female attracts males by moving her tongue around to initiate mating. If the male does not respond, she moves on to another mate. The average gestation period is 190 days. The infant will stay with the mother for 18–24 months. After males reach sexual maturity, they are expelled from their natal group. The male must then invade a foreign group. There, the male kills off the other leader and whatever offspring the first leader sired. By doing this, the male is killing any possible competition. Less than 25% of offspring survive male invasions. ==Subspecies== Traditionally, three subspecies of this howler are listed, though Stanyon et al. (1995) concluded the number of chromosomal differences between A. s. sara and A. s. arctoidea (which resulted in A. s. sara being a considered a full species) was on a similar scale to that found between A. s. sara and A. s. seniculus by Minezawa et al. (1986). *Colombian red howler, Alouatta seniculus seniculus *Ursine howler, A. s. arctoidea *Juruá red howler, A. s. juara A. s. juara has been described as a different species Alouatta juara. ==References== *Heatwole, Alan M..

The butterfly is also known as the lime butterfly, lemon butterfly, lime swallowtail, and chequered swallowtail. These common names refer to their host plants, which are usually citrus species such as the cultivated lime. Unlike most swallowtail butterflies, it does not have a prominent tail. The butterfly is a pest and invasive species, found from Asia to Australia. The butterfly has spread to Hispaniola island (Dominican Republic) in the Western Hemisphere, and to Mahé, Seychelles. ==Description== The butterfly is tailless and has a wingspan 80–100 mm. Above, the background colour is black. A broad, irregular yellow band is found on the wings above, which is broken in the case of the forewing. Besides this, the butterfly has a large number of irregular spots on the wing. The upper hindwing has a red tornal spot with blue edging around it. As the caterpillar ages, its hunger for leaf tissue continues to grow. Detailed description as given by Charles Thomas Bingham in 1905: File:Lime Butterfly on Flower.JPGCollecting nectar from chinarose at ABS Academy Campus, Durgapur, West Bengal, India File:Lime wings.jpgThe red tornal spot with blue edging File:Lime Butterfly (Papilio demoleus) in Narshapur, AP W IMG 0988.jpgAn older adult with orange spots File:Papilio demoleus ALT by kadavoor.jpgMating File:Lime butterfly (Papilio demoleus stenelinus) male Rinca I.jpgP. d. stenelinus Rinca, Indonesia File:Lime butterfly (Papilio demoleus malayanus) male Changi Point S.jpgP. d. malayanus Singapore ==Status, range, and habitat== P. demoleus is perhaps the most widely distributed swallowtail in the world. The butterfly can be found in: The Southeast Asian subspecies Papilio demoleus malayanus recently established an abundant non-native population on Mahé in Seychelles This species was probably accidentally introduced to Mahé a few years ago (first records in November 2016). Further dispersal events of Papilio demoleus within Seychelles to other granitic islands of the archipelago, e.g. Praslin and La Digue, are expected. Formerly absent from Borneo, it is now one of the commonest papilionids in Sabah and Sarawak in Malaysian Borneo, Kalimantan (Indonesian Borneo), and Brunei., In recent years, the butterfly has spread to Hispaniola island (Dominican Republic) in the Western Hemisphere, and subsequently to Jamaica, and Puerto Rico. The Dominican population originated from Southeast Asia but how the butterfly reached there is not known. The widespread range of P. demoleus indicates the butterfly's tolerance and adaptation to diverse habitats. It is found in savannahs, fallow lands, gardens, evergreen and semi- evergreen forests, and shows a preference for streams and riverbeds. In India, it is mostly found in the plains, but can be found on the hills of peninsular India and up to in the Himalayas. It is common in urban gardens and may also be encountered in wooded country. The butterfly is also a very successful invader, its spread appearing to be due to its strong flight, increase in urbanisation and agricultural land use that opens up new areas for dispersal, and greater availability of food plants. ==Taxonomy== Five related butterflies form the group of lime butterflies in the genus Papilio of which P. demoleus Linnaeus, 1758 is the flagship species, which gives the name to the group. The other morphologically related butterflies are: * Papilio demodocus (Esper, 1798) * Papilio erithonioides Grose-Smith, 1891 * Papilio grosesmithi Rothschild, 1926 * Papilio morondavana Grose-Smith, 1891 The citrus swallowtail (P. demodocus Esper) is found in sub-Saharan Africa, while the other three species are endemic to Madagascar. Image:Papilio_demoleus01.JPGCommon lime butterfly, P. demoleus Image:Papilio_demodocus_1.JPGCitrus swallowtail, P. demodocus File:Papiliomorondavana.JPGMadagascan emperor swallowtail, Papilio morondavana Research into the biogeography, phylogeny, and analysis of vicariance relationships dating back to the Cretaceous, of the \\"lime butterfly\\" or \\"demoleus\\" group, suggest that the group of lime swallowtails diversified in Madagascar in the middle Miocene. Six subspecies are recognised in P. demoleus: * P. d. demoleus Linnaeus, 1758 — Across Asia from China to the Arabian peninsula, and now colonized Turkey, Iraq, Syria, the Philippines, the Talaud and Sula islands, and the Moluccas (Ambon and Ceram) * P. d. libanius Fruhstorfer, 1908 — Taiwan, Philippines, Sula, Talaud * P. d. malayanus Wallace, 1865 — Sumatra and the Malaysian peninsula, and now expanded its range to Southern Europe (one record in Portugal), Greater Sunda Islands (Sumatra, Java, Borneo, and Bali), Wallacea (Sulawesi, Sumbawa, Lombok, Timor, Leti, Flores, Wetar, and Alor), New Guinea, Bismarck Archipelago, Christmas Island, Torres Strait Islands (Dauan Island), Greater Antilles Islands (Hispaniola, Jamaica, Puerto Rico, Cuba, and Nueva Gerona), and Seychelles (Mahé) * P. d. novoguineensis Rothschild, 1908 — the southeastern edge of Papua New Guinea around Port Moresby * P. d. sthenelus Macleay, 1826 — Australia * P. d. stenelinus Rothschild, 1895 — Sumba, Flores, and Alor ==Behavior== Lime butterflies mud-puddling with common emigrants (Catopsilia pomona) in India This butterfly is an avid mud-puddler and visitor of flowers. It basks with its wings held wide open on tufts of grass and herbs, and generally keeps within a metre of the ground, even on cloudy days. It relies on its quick flight for escape. It has a number of modes of flight. In the cool of the morning, the flight is slow considering that it is an edible and unprotected swallowtail. As the day progresses, it flies fast, straight, and low. In the hotter part of the day, it may be found settling on damp patches, where it will remain motionless, except for an occasional flutter of wings, if not disturbed. It is also a frequent visitor of flowers in gardens, where it shows a preference for flowers of smaller herbs rather than larger plants such as the ubiquitous Lantana with its plentiful blooms. It can be found swarming in the groves of its food plants. Research on freshly emerged imagines of P. demoleus showed that they have an inborn or spontaneous preference while feeding for blue and purple colours, while the yellow, yellowish-green, green, and blue-green colours are completely neglected.

In the ideal conditions of a laboratory, a generation has been recorded to take place in just over 30 days. The typical time for one generation of P. demoleus to mature in the field ranges from 26 to 59 days. In cold climates, the lime butterfly is known to pass the winter as pupae. Typically, the butterfly undergoes five instars as a caterpillar. The female butterfly goes from plant to plant, laying a single egg at a time on top of a leaf, which it holds onto with its legs, and flies off as soon as the egg is laid. The egg is round, light yellowish in colour, flattened at the base, smooth-surfaced, and about 1.5 mm in height. Fertile eggs develop a small red mark at the apex. The newly hatched caterpillar stays in the middle of the upperside of the leaf. The first instar of the caterpillar is black, with a black head and two rows of subdorsal fleshy spines. The second, third, and fourth instars are dark, with a glossy, dark-brown head, and white markings on the eighth and ninth segments of the caterpillar, which resemble a white patch of uric acid deposited in a bird's droppings, helping them escape predation while remaining in moderately open places. As the instars progress, this resemblance is lost. From the fifth instar onwards, the caterpillars now turn cylindrical in shape, tapered towards the rear, and uniformly pale green in colour with a white subspiracular band. An additional black band is developed on the fourth and fifth segments with two black and two bluish spots on them. The eighth and ninth segments, which earlier provided the camouflage markings now develop a brown and white band. At this stage, the caterpillars are forced to inhabit secluded places. The pupa, which is rugose (wrinkled), stout, and 30 mm in length, has two projections to the front on its head and also one on its thorax, and resembles that of the common Mormon (Papilio polytes), the difference being that the common Mormon pupa has a deeper cut between the projections and its abdomen is more protruded on the sides, having a small point. The pupa is dimorphic with regards to colour, with the colour developing according to the prevalent colour and texture in the background. The green morph, which is found amongst green vegetation and smoother textures, is light green and unmarked or with yellow dorsal markings. When situated among brown or dry objects, the pupa tend to turn light grey brown to pink brown and develop cryptic dark brown and black striation. The adults fly in every month, but are particularly abundant during and after the monsoons. Captive breeding of P. demoleus in Riyadh has revealed these data about the lifespan of various stages at that locality: * Number of generations per year: 8 * Duration of egg stage: 3.1 to 6.1 days * Duration of larva stage: 12.9 and 22.7 days * Duration of pupa stage: 8.0 to 22.4 days * Duration of adult stage: 4 to 6 days with average of 5.1 days Image:Papilio demoleus cat sec.jpg Early-instar \\"birds-dropping\\" caterpillar Image:Lime Butterfly (Papilio demoleus) Cat in Narsapur forest, AP W IMG_0241.jpgearly fifth- instar caterpillar Image:Vv lime cat.jpglate fifth-instar caterpillar Image:Vv lime pupa.jpgPupa in rearing cage ===Parasitism and predation=== Cocoons of a parasitoid wasp (Apanteles species), next to a perforated P. demoleus caterpillar Despite their two-stage camouflage scheme, some caterpillars of P. demoleus are found by parasitic wasps, which lay dozens of eggs in them. The parasitic wasp larvae eat the caterpillar from the inside. Initially, the vital organs are avoided, but by the time the caterpillar is ready to pupate, even the vital organs are consumed. Shortly before, or soon after the caterpillar pupates, the parasitoids emerge from their host, thus killing it. In Saudi Arabia, the highest mortality rate was found to be in larvae and pupae in cultivated populations due to a bacterium of the genus Bacillus. In addition, eggs and larvae were heavily preyed upon by two unidentified species of spiders which were abundant on citrus trees. In China, species of fungi in the genus Ophiocordyceps are known to parasitize many kinds of caterpillars, including P. demoleus. The spores were spread out on the parents, and infect the young caterpillar, then when the caterpillars become pupae, they will fail to develop into adults; instead, the fungi kill and eat the caterpillar flesh from within, and grow a spore bud out of the dead caterpillar corpse. The fungi known as dōng chóng xià cǎo are thought to have medicinal properties in China, and are known in English as caterpillar fungus. In India, these braconid wasp parasitoids are known to parasitize P. demoleus larvae: * Apanteles species including Apanteles papilionis * Habrobracon hebetor In Thailand, a number of organisms have been recorded attacking immature stages of P. demoleus: * Egg parasites – **Ooencyrtus malayensis Ferriere (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae) **Tetrastichus sp. (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) * Larval stage – ** Erycia nymphalidophaga Baronoff (Diptera: Tachinidae) (parasite) ** Cantheconidea furcellata (Wolff) (Pentatomidae predator ** Other natural enemies of larvae included reduviid bugs; birds; spiders; sphecid wasps; and chameleons. * Pupal parasites – ** Brachymeria sp. (Hymenoptera: Chalcididae) ** Pteromalus puparum Linnaeus (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae) ** Ophiocordyceps In Jamaica, an encyrtid egg parasitoid and a chalcidoid parasitoid have been reported. ==Food plants== Key lime, a species of the cultivated lime, the principal food plant of P. demoleus The larval food plants of P. demoleus in Asia are from the family Rutaceae, while in Australia and Papua New Guinea, the butterfly also feeds on host plants of family Fabaceae. ===Family Rutaceae=== * Cultivated lime,Wynter-Blyth, M.A. (1957) pg 500. orange and lemon. **C. aurantifolia, C. grandis, C. limon, C. sinensis, * Atalanta racemosa * Glycosmis pentaphylla * Ruta graveolens * Bael (Aegle marmelos) * Murraya koenigii (curry tree) * Chloroxylon swietenia * Acronychia pedunculata * Microcitrus australis (Australian round-lime, Australian lime) ===Family Rhamnaceae=== * Ber (Ziziphus mauritiana) ===Family Fabaceae=== They have been observed on: * Many species of Cullen: Cullen australasicum, C. badocanum, C. balsamicum, C. cinereum, C. patens (spreading scurf-pea, native verbine), C. pustulatum, and C. tenax (tough scurf-pea, emu- foot, emu grass), and C. leucanthum. * Psoralea pinnata (fountain bush) ==Economic significance== Caterpillars devouring lemon leaves The lime butterfly is an economic pest on many cultivated citrus species in India, Pakistan, Iraq, and the Middle East. Due to its history of successful dispersal and range extension, the lime butterfly is likely to spread from its original point of introduction in Hispaniola in the Caribbean to neighbouring Florida, Central America, and South America. Due to its capability for rapid population growth under favourable circumstances and its having been recorded to have five generations in a year in temperate regions of China, it is considered a serious potential threat. The caterpillars can completely defoliate young citrus trees (below 2 feet) and devastate citrus nurseries. In mature trees, caterpillars may prefer young leaves and leaf flush. Hand- picking of caterpillars and spraying with endosulfan 35 EC (2 ml/10 litres of water) were the recommended means of pest control by Indian government agencies and agricultural colleges, . however, endosulfan has since been banned by the Supreme Court of India. ==See also== *List of butterflies of India (Papilionidae) *List of butterflies of Jamaica ==References== ==Further reading== *Chattopadhyay, Jagannath.

It lives in groups of two to 11 individuals. Despite the name \\"brown howler\\", it is notably variable in colour, with some individuals appearing largely reddish- orange or black.Gregorin, R. (2006). Taxonomia e variação geográfica das espécies do gênero Alouatta Lacépède (Primates, Atelidae) no Brasil. Rev. Bras. Zool. 23(1). The two subspecies are: *Northern brown howler (A. g. guariba), listed as critically endangered *Southern brown howler (A. g. clamitans) ==Geographic distribution== The brown howler lives in the Atlantic forest in South America. The region spreads through the Brazilian states of Bahia and Espírito Santo through Rio Grande do Sul, and Misiones in Argentina.Agostini, I., Holzmann, I., Di Bitetti, M. S., Oklander, L. I., Kowalewski, M. M., Beldomnico, P. M., . . . Miller, P. (2014). Building a Species Conservation Strategy for the brown howler monkey (Alouatta guariba clamitans) in Argentina in the context of yellow fever outbreaks. Tropical Conservation Science, 7(1), 26-34. ==Diet== Brown howler monkeys are folivores and frugivorous. The diet of the brown howler monkey consists primarily of leaves and trees. Of the food sources it seems that the genera Ficus, Zanthoxylum, and Eugenia are the most significant types consumed. Brown howler monkeys that live in higher latitudes tend to eat a lower percentage of leaves in their diet. Mature leaves are less nutritious and are more fibrous, than the preferred young leaves. A typical brown howler diet will also include mature fruit, wild figs, petioles, buds, flowers, seeds, moss, stems, and twigs The Atlantic forest, where brown howlers tend to live, has an increasing forest fragmentation. Forest fragmentation means that there would be a decrease in potential food supplies. The brown howler’s feeding ecology, however, does not seem to be affected by the loss in habitat. ==Behavior== ===Howling=== Brown howler monkeys are part of the group of monkeys known for their howls/roars. Howlers are able to create such loud and specific sounds by specific body shape and structures. The larynx is enlarged and they have an enlarged open chest that creates a resonating chamber to increase the sound produced. The howlers also have specialized vocal chords to produce the specific sound. The most frequent reason for the howling is for mate defense. Howling occurs most when there are both female and male howlers present. The males are the dominant group as they begin all cases of howling. Females participate in howling much less than males. Howling can also occur in groups during the dry season. It is believed that this is due to food scarcity. The brown howlers use their sounds to show ownership over certain food or territory. ===Anti-predator behavior=== The black hawk eagle is a predator of the brown howler monkey. The roars of the brown howler allow the black hawk eagle to determine their location. The brown howler’s response has three parts. First, when one brown howler becomes aware of a black hawk eagle they will alarm the group and then they will immediately become silent. Next they descend in the understory of the trees, and finally they will all disperse in an organized manner. The adults will lead the young away from danger. The young are considered to be the primary target for the black hawk eagle. There is a more conservative response when adult brown howlers are without the young, and the black hawk eagle is present, thus indicating that the black hawk eagles are targeting the young howlers. When the brown howler monkey is threatened by terrestrial animals they will remain in the tree canopy and remain silent for 5–15 minutes. ===Rubbing=== Brown howler monkeys rub one another for group communication. The rubbing can be used for various purposes. Males will rub their hyoid bone and sternum against each other to show agonistic and territorial signals. Males will also rub females for sexual intentions. The males are considered to be the dominant over females because they rub much more often than females. Dominate females will rub more often than non-dominate females, but still much less than males. ===Reproduction=== An adult pair and a young, also showing some of the distinct color variations in this species It is difficult to breed the genus Alouatta in captivity and therefore the reproduction is relatively unknown. Brown howlers reproduce year round. There seems to be no correlation to birth rates in rainy or dry season or in times of increased fruit or leaves. It is thought that because the brown howler has a folivorous diet, conception is less dependent on maternal conditions. The average interbirth interval (IBI) for the brown howler is 19.9 months, which is similar to other howler species. It does not seem that the sex of the infant or the number of females in the population has a significant effect on IBI. The death of an infant will shorten the mother's IBI and seems to be one of the few factors that affects IBI. ==Yellow fever== Brown howlers are highly susceptible to the yellow fever virus and have a high mortality rate when infected. When mass amounts of brown howlers are found dead it is a good inclination that there may be a yellow fever outbreak occurring. Since the brown howlers have such a high mortality rate they are not considered to maintain the virus in their population. Communities that live near the brown howler populations have previously held the belief that the brown howlers were the cause of the disease, and would kill them to stop the spread of disease. In order to protect the brown howlers the local communities should limit their killing and become vaccinated to prevent the disease from spreading. The transmission of yellow fever is through mosquito vectors. In South America the known mosquito vectors of yellow fever are in the genera Haemagogus and Sabethes. In Argentina, the species that has been shown to carry the yellow fever virus (YFV) is Sabethes albiprivis. In 2008-2009 there was a yellow fever outbreak among a brown howler study group in the protected Misiones, El Piñalito Provincial Park. The brown howler is not abundant in Argentina and any outbreak could have a detrimental effect on the population. A group of researchers have created the Brown Howler Conservation Group to continue to study and monitor yellow fever in the brown howler populations. == References == == External links == *ARKive - images and movies of the brown howling monkey (Alouatta guariba) brown howler Category:Mammals of Argentina Category:Mammals of Brazil Category:Fauna of the Atlantic Forest (biome) brown howler ","title":"Brown howler"},{"id":"3236897","text":"The J. C. Van Horne Bridge is a Canadian steel through truss/steel deck truss bridge crossing the Restigouche River between Campbellton, New Brunswick and Pointe-à-la-Croix, Quebec. Built between June 1958 and October 1961, the bridge was opened to traffic on October 15, 1961. As an interprovincial crossing, the bridge was constructed under a three-party agreement between the governments of Canada, New Brunswick and Quebec. Measuring 805 m (2641.07 ft) in total length, the bridge consists of four deck-truss approach-spans joined in the middle with a cantilever-through-truss structure. The middle structure is composed of two anchor spans and one clear span over the navigational channel measuring 380 m (1246.71 ft). It carries 2 traffic lanes and 2 sidewalks. ==History== Crossing the Restigouche River between Campbellton, NB and Pointe-à-la-Croix, QC had long been a bone of contention by locals in both provinces. A federally funded inter-provincial ferry service between the two communities had proven adequate until the 1950s when vehicle traffic began to grow at much higher rate than forecast. By the late 1950s, local New Brunswick PC Member of Parliament J.C. Van Horne made the case for a bridge and invited representatives from the federal and provincial governments to witness a \\"typical weekend\\" lineup at the ferry. Van Horne had chosen the Ste. Anne Feast weekend (On or around July 26) where the lineups would be predictably long on both sides. The government representatives were convinced of the need for a bridge to replace the ferry service and acceded to Van Horne's wishes.

Together with the brown howler, it is the southernmost member of the Alouatta genus. Only the adult male is black; adult females and juveniles of both genders are overall whitish to yellowish-buff.Gregorin, R. (2006). Taxonomia e variação geográfica das espécies do gênero Alouatta Lacépède (Primates, Atelidae) no Brasil. Rev. Bras. Zool. 23(1). However, variations occur even among the adult males; some have patches of reddish-brown or buff fur. Two females in a tree branch, using their strong prehensile tail as a safety fifth limb, in Pantanal, Bolivia They live in groups of three to 19 individuals (usually seven to 9). The sex ratio is usually one to three males for every seven to nine females in a group. Mating occurs within the group. Named for their vocalizations, they may be heard most often around sunrise. This \\"dawn chorus\\" sounds much more like roaring than howling, and it announces the howlers' position as a means to avoiding conflict with other groups. The call can be heard up to 5 km away. These monkeys commonly sleep or rest up to 70% of the day, making it one of the least active monkeys in the New World. Their habitat is forest, especially semideciduous and gallery. Black howlers are folivorous, eating mostly leaves,National Geographic and occasionally fruit, such as figs. They generally prefer walking and climbing to running or leaping. The prehensile tail is very strong and acts as a fifth limb, allowing the monkeys greater versatility when climbing and allowing them greater safety in the occasional fall from a high branch. Because their limb structure makes terrestrial movement awkward, they spend most of their time in the trees and only come down for water during dry spells. Otherwise, the monkeys drink by wetting their hands on moist leaves, and then licking the water off their hands. Their lifespans are up to 20 years, but more commonly 15 years in the wild. In Argentina it is commonly kept as a pet due to its gentle nature. Female at the Apenheul Primate Park ==References== * Louise Emmons and Francois Feer. (1997).

It is difficult to distinguish it from Abisara bifasciata. Larva Pupa This active butterfly is usually seen at the tops of trees and amidst foliage. It has a habit of landing and turning around almost immediately after alighting. It repeats this turning movements as it moves along branches. This is believed to help in evading predators by causing confusion about head orientation. This distinctive mode of movement gives the impression of dancing and is an important field characteristic that helps in identifying the species from even a distance. == Description == Charles Thomas Bingham in his The Fauna of British India, Including Ceylon and Burma volume on butterflies describes the species as follows: A very variable form. Termen of hindwing more or less broadly angulate or produced at apex of interspace 3, but not narrow or tailed as in Abisara neophron. === Wet-season form === Wet-season form, female in Talakona forest, in Chittoor District of Andhra Pradesh, India Male in Buxa Tiger Reserve, West Bengal, India Male: Upperside rich purple-brown or maroon- brown with a blue gloss. Forewing with discal and postdiscal transverse fasciae very obscure and only slightly paler than the ground colour. Hindwing uniform; two inwardly conical small black spots near apex of interspace 1, and single similar but larger black spots near apices of interspaces 5 and 6; all these spots bordered slenderly and somewhat obscurely on the outer side with white. Underside dull maroon brown. Forewing with a broad, slightly curved discal, narrower postdiscal and subterminal transverse pale bands; the discal fascia broadening anteriorly. Hindwing: a slightly curved narrow discal pale fascia; the black spots as on the upperside, but bordered on the inner and on the outer sides by an obscure pale lunular line. Antennae black with scattered pale specks; head, thorax and abdomen maroon-brown; beneath, the palpi, thorax and abdomen paler brown. Female: Upperside: hazel brown, the terminal halves of the wings paler. Forewing: discal and postdiscal broad, obscure, pale transverse fasciae, followed by similarly obscure, somewhat broken, inner and outer subterminal pale transverse lines. Hindwing with a transverse series of obscure postdiscal pale lunular spots; the black white-margined spots as in the male but smaller, the anterior two superposed, on the pale spots; terminal margin below vein 4 with inner and outer, and above vein 4 with single subterminal transversely linear markings. Underside: ground colour similar but paler on the basal, very much paler on the terminal halves of the wings; the markings as on the upperside, but the fasciae on the forewings and hindwings broader, more diffuse; the black subterminal spots in interspaces 1, 5 and 6 of the hindwing smaller. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen as in the male but paler. === Dry-season form === Male: Upperside the maroon brown not glossed with purple; the transverse fasciae on the forewing and the black markings on the hindwing much as in the wet-season form, but the former more obscure, more diffuse, the latter smaller. Underside as in the wet-season form but paler. Female: Upper and under sides similar to those of the wet-season, form but conspicuously paler, the contrast between the dark basal and pale terminal halves in fore prominent, the discal band on the underside of the forewing very broad, diffuse and pale, often nearly white. Antenna, head, thorax and abdomen in both sexes as in the wet-season form but paler. Wingspan: 41–52 mm. == Races == Variety angulata Moore, and variety abnormis Moore, have been described from Burma and Tenasserim. Typically, these differ slightly from A. echerius as follows: Upperside with no purple gloss; the discal and postdiscal transverse bands more clearly defined, the former sometimes white anteriorly on the upperside, generally white or whitish on the underside and extending across both forewings and hindwings; underside of hindwing with an extra, subterminal black spot. The white markings and the extra black spot are variable characters, and specimens intermediate between typical A. echerius and typical angulata or abnormis are not uncommon. Race bifasciata (Moore) is found in the Andaman Islands. Male upperside is not as dark as in the wet- season form of echerius. The transverse pale bands on both wings are broad and diffuse. == Distribution == This species lives in the Himalayas, Chumba to Kumaon, Nepal and Bhutan; Ambala; Fyzabad; Malda; Calcutta; Gunjam; southern India from below Pune and Mumbai; Sri Lanka; Myanmar (Tenasserim); China. == Life history == The eggs of the butterfly are laid on host plants belonging to the family Primulaceae, including Ardisia species, Maesa indicaKunte, K. 2006.

It was located in north Auckland, and named after the suburb of Albany. It existed from 1978 to 2002, with a break from 1984 to 1987. ==Population centres== The 1977 electoral redistribution was the most overtly political since the Representation Commission had been established through an amendment to the Representation Act in 1886, initiated by Muldoon's National Government. As part of the 1976 census, a large number of people failed to fill out an electoral re-registration card, and census staff had not been given the authority to insist on the card being completed. This had little practical effect for people on the general roll, but it transferred Māori to the general roll if the card was not handed in. Together with a northward shift of New Zealand's population, this resulted in five new electorates having to be created in the upper part of the North Island. The electoral redistribution was very disruptive, and 22 electorates were abolished, while 27 electorates were newly created (including Albany) or re- established. These changes came into effect for the . The Albany electorate was centred on Albany, which had previously been part of electorate. Its territory extended southwards to include Greenhithe and Paremoremo (also formerly part of Waitemata), plus a large portion of Glenfield (formerly split between Waitemata and ). It extended northwards to include Okura, Orewa, and Stanmore Bay (which were formerly part of Rodney electorate). For the , however, the electorate was abolished. Glenfield and Greenhithe were split off to form the electorate, and most of the remainder (including Albany itself) was absorbed into electorate. The 1987 electoral redistribution took the continued population growth in the North Island into account, and two additional general electorates were created, bringing the total number of electorates to 97. In the South Island, the shift of population to Christchurch had continued. Overall, three electorates were newly created, three electorates were recreated (including Albany), and four electorates were abolished. All of those electorates were in the North Island. Changes in the South Island were restricted to boundary changes. These changes came into effect with the . The Albany electorate was based around the portion of the former Albany which had been merged into Rodney, plus Greenhithe (which had become part of Glenfield). Glenfield itself remained its own electorate. The new Albany also included Hobsonville and Whenuapai, taken from , and stretched as far north as Orewa. For the , the electorate expanded to the west slightly, towards Kumeu, but this was effectively reversed at the . When the transition to MMP prompted a major redistribution at the , most of the Glenfield seat was merged into Albany, almost bringing the seat back to its original shape in 1978. It lost some ground to the west at the . For the , the seat was abolished once again -- its western territories, including Greenhithe and Albany itself, became part of the new electorate, while the remainder was established as the new electorate. ==History== Don McKinnon of the National Party was the first representative of the electorate.

It is endemic to Brazil, found in the southeastern Amazon and disjunctly in the Atlantic Forest between Rio Grande do Norte and Sergipe. ==Taxonomy== Considerable taxonomic confusion has surrounded this species. Until 2001, most authorities included the Amazon black howler as a subspecies (or simply a taxonomically insignificant variation) of the red-handed howler,Groves, C. (2001). Primate Taxonomy. Smithsonian Institution Press. though its distinction had already been pointed out much earlier.da Cruz Lima, E. (1945). Mammals of Amazônia. Vol. 1. Contribuições do Museu Paraense Emílio Goeldi de História Natural e Etnografia. The red-handed howler remained variable in ecology, colour and pattern of the fur, shape of the cranium, and shape of the hyoid bone (of great importance in the voice of the howler monkeys; a likely isolating mechanism between the species),Gregorin, R. (2006). Taxonomia e variação geográfica das espécies do gênero Alouatta Lacépède (Primates, Atelidae) no Brasil. Rev. Bras. Zool. 23(1). but a geographical pattern was not clear, resulting in it being treated as a monotypic species. In 2006, a major review of the Brazilian members of the genus Alouatta was able to match some of the variations to geography (though further study was recommended), resulting in the recognition of the Spix's red-handed howler and Maranhão red-handed howler as species separate from the red-handed howler. Even with these as separate species, the colour and pattern of the fur of the red-handed howler remains variable. Most adults are black with reddish-brown hands, feet and distal part of their tails, but some are entirely black (resembling the Amazon black howler), reddish (resembling the red howlers) or somewhere in between. ==Distribution and life history== It lives in the biomes of Amazonian and Atlantic forests which consist of dense forest separated by drier areas. These animals can live up to 20 years,Nascimento F.F., Bonvicino C.R., De Oliverira M.M., Schneider M.P.C. (2008). Population Genetic Studies of Alouatta Belzebul from the Amazonian and Atlantic Forests. American Journal of Primatology 70, 423-431. and do not mature until later in their lives. They have a long gestation period, and generally reproduce more slowly than similar-sized mammals of other species.Horwich R.H. (1998). Effective Solutions for Howler Conservation. International Journal of Primatology 19,3. From the births that have been recorded, red-handed howlers have quick, quiet births during the day when they are normally active. Once born, if the mother is experienced, she will carry her young ventrally for three weeks and then switch to dorsally once the offspring is slightly more developed.Camargo C.C., Ferrari S.F. (2007). Observations of Daytime Births in Two Groups of Red-Handed Howlers (Alouatta belzebul) on an Island in the Tucurui Reservoir in Eastern Brazilian Amazonia. American Journal of Primatology 69, 1075-1079. == Behavior and diet == When not foraging, red-handed howlers rest in the canopy of mature trees from the forest floor. They also live in social groups of seven to 12 members, with one or two mature males, females, juveniles, and infants.Camargo C.C., Ferrari S.F. (2007). Interactions between tayras (Eira barbara) and red-handed howlers (A. belzebul) in eastern Amazonia. Primates 48(2):147-50 ==Threats== Red-handed howler monkey in Gargaú Reserve, Paraíba, Brazil. Threats to this species are numerous. First, they are a large-bodied mammal hunted for food. Females with young are especially good targets for hunting because the babies can be sold as pets and the mothers can be used for their meat. Slower reproduction of these mammals also prevents them from replenishing the population in response to this pressure. The red-handed howler monkey has one of the smallest ranges of their genus, which makes them even more susceptible to threats. Second, the Trans-Amazonia and the Belém-Brasília Highways intersect their habitats, which causes collisions with automobiles. Third, the threat from agriculture is increasing. Increasing population pressures have forced farmers to clear more land for farming and these clear-cut methods are too much of a disturbance for the red-handed howler. Some small disturbances are tolerated by species that focus more on leaves, but since A. belzebul is mostly frugivorous, it is harder for them to adapt to change. Logging is yet another concern, because it not only disrupts the habitat too much, but it also allows better access to their habitats for hunters by use of the access roads. Fourth, habitat fragmentation accompanies all of these disturbances. If the forest does eventually regenerate, there will still be no way for new howlers to come back into the area and it also prohibits gene flow and the amount of genetic variation will decrease. Lastly, predation can have a large effect on the population. Since the populations are usually in groups in small areas, they are easy prey for animals such tayras. One study found tayras had found their way onto an island and took out a large portion of the population by hunting together and preying on the family groups in the area. ===Conservation steps=== A variety of options can be put into place to help the red-handed howler monkey recover. First, landowners can be encouraged to make sanctuaries or protect vital habitats. Since this species relies so heavily on fruit, certain habitats with a variety of fruit-producing tree stands should be focused on for protection. Second, if slash-and-burn methods are needed, farmers could use smaller portions of forest and rotate often to allow for forest regeneration and repopulation by howlers. Corridors could also be maintained between properties, crop areas, and developed areas. Success has also been documented on the use of ladder bridges across roads to allow red-handed howlers to cross roads safely. Third, translocation is could be used to repopulate suitable habitat the animals may not be able to reach because of fragmentation. Translocation could also be a useful tool in allowing gene flow between populations that would generally not mix. Lastly, the genetics of the populations should be monitored to make sure adequate genetic variability is present to sustain the populations. Some of these studies are already being done using microsatellite loci to determine diversity.Goncalves E.C., Silva A., Barbosa M.S.R., Schneider M.P.C. (2004).

The art draws from various cultures and elements from both Islamic and pre-Islamic times. ==Background and formation== Being situated on the edge of deserts and arid regions, Persian (Iranian) cities typically have hot summers, and cold, dry winters. Iran’s traditional architecture is designed in proportion to its climatic conditions. The continued design and existence of traditional homes amidst the preponderance of mid-rise apartments in Iran's ongoing modernisation projects is testament to a strong connection and identification with Persian architectural heritage. Iran's old city fabric is composed of narrow winding streets called koocheh with high walls of adobe and brick, often roofed at various intervals. This form of urban design, which used to be commonplace in Iran, is an optimal form of desert architecture that minimizes desert expansion and the effects of dust storms. It also maximizes daytime shades, and insulates the “fabric” from severe winter temperatures. Islamic beliefs coupled with the necessity to defend cities against frequent foreign invasions encouraged traditional Persian residential architects to create inward seeking designs amidst these narrow complicated koochehs, weaving tightly knit residential neighborhoods. Thus, the house becomes the container as opposed to the contained. These houses possess an innate system of protection: they all have enclosed gardens with maximum privacy, preventing any view into the house from the outside world. Hence residential architecture in Persia was designed in a way so as to provide maximum protection to the inhabitants during times of tension and danger, while furnishing a microcosm of tranquillity that protected this inner \\"paradise garden\\". Neighborhoods in old Persian cities often formed around shrines of popular saints. All public facilities such as baths, houses of mourning (tekyehs), teahouses, administration offices, and schools were to be found within the neighborhood itself. In addition to the main bazaar of the city, each neighborhood often had its own bazaar-cheh as well (i.e. “little bazaar”), as well as its own ab anbar (or public water reservoir), which provided the neighborhood with clean water. Qazvin, for example had over 100 such reservoirs before being modernized with city plumbing in modern times. image:Architecture125.JPGA roofscape of a traditional neighborhood in Kashan.

When visiting Kashan in 1993, the chairman of UNESCO remarked: “Kashani architects are the greatest alchemists of history. They could make gold out of dust”. Indeed, almost all of Kashan's masterpieces, as in many other parts in Iran are made of humble, local, earth. Like many other cities throughout Iran, stucco was the most widespread method of ornamentation in Persian houses. One reason was the relatively cheap price of the materials used (like gypsum for example) that don't require a high temperature to be transformed into plaster. This is an important consideration in places like central Iran where wood is relatively scarce. Another reason is that it is easily shaped, molded, or carved. Thanks to stucco, a wall of crudely fashioned stone blocks or raw brick, gives an impression of great luxury. Thus stucco owes its luxurious appearance to the skill of the craftsman. And with a tradition of stucco technique going back to pre-Islamic Iran, this is an art fully mastered by Persian craftsmen, as seen here. Earthquakes in Iran leave massive destruction. Most of Iran's remaining traditional houses date from the post-quake eras during the Qajar period. Despite the efforts of architects to build resistance to earthquakes into their works, hardly anything remains from the spectacular Safavi palaces or anything prior to those as recounted by French and British explorers in many parts of Persia. ==Characteristics of traditional Persian residential architecture== Almost all traditional Persian houses were designed in order to satisfy the following essential features: # Hashti and Dalan-e-vorudi: Entering the doorway one steps into a small enclosed transitional space called Hashti. Here one is forced to redirect one's steps away from the street and into the hallway, called Dalan e Vorudi. In mosques, the Hashti enables the architect to turn the steps of the believer to the correct orientation for prayer hence giving the opportunity to purify oneself before entering the mosque. # Convenient access to all parts of the house. # A central pool (howz) with surrounding gardens containing trees of figs, pomegranates, and grape vines. # Important partitionings such as the biruni (exterior) and the andaruni (interior). # Specific orientation facing toward and away from Mecca. Furthermore, Persian houses in central Iran were designed to make use of an ingenious systems of wind catchers that create unusually cool temperatures in the lower levels of the building. Thick massive walls were designed to keep the sun's heat out in the summertime while retaining the internal heat in the winters.

Persia's distinctive artistic heritage with efficient yet ancient technical know-how thus created houses and spaces whose features were aesthetic talars and roofscapes with intriguing light wells, as well as intricate window and mirror works, paintings, reliefs, and a beautifully crafted iwan amidst comfortable residential spaces in hot arid regions. Whereas the geometrical rigor seen in the works such as those in Safavi era Isfahan invoke the perfect order of the celestial world, the vegetal ornamentation realized in the interiors of houses, testify to the Persian love of gardens. And the stucco carvings, frescoes, and paintings executed by royal craftsmen, exemplify the level of Persian aesthetics. ==Elements== *Talar *Iwan *Dalan-e vorudi *Badgir *Qanat *Kariz *Gonbad *Garden (hayāt) *Shabestan *Kucheh *Panjdari *Hashti *Andaruni *Biruni *Ab anbar *Yakhchal *Howz ==Samples== *Abbasian House *House of Tabatabaei *Amerian House *Borujerdi ha House *House of Qavam *Tiznoo House == Notes== Category:Architecture of Iran Category:Persian gardens * Category:Islamic architecture ","title":"Traditional Persian residential architecture"},{"id":"3236991","text":"is an avant-garde composer, singer, synthesizer player, and member of the rock band Factor. == Career == Sato moved to London, England in 1995.

The CDIO Initiative is an educational framework that stresses engineering fundamentals set in the context of conceiving, designing, implementing and operating real-world systems and products. Throughout the world, CDIO Initiative collaborators have adopted CDIO as the framework of their curricular planning and outcome-based assessment. The CDIO approach uses active learning tools, such as group projects and problem-based learning, to better equip engineering students with technical knowledge as well as communication and professional skills. Additionally, the CDIO Initiative provides resources for instructors of member universities to improve their teaching abilities. ==Concept== The CDIO concept was originally conceived at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the late 1990s. In 2000, MIT in collaboration with three Swedish universities - Chalmers University of Technology, Linköping University and the Royal Institute of Technology — formally founded the CDIO Initiative. It became an international collaboration, with universities around the world adopting the same framework. CDIO collaborators recognize that an engineering education is acquired over a long period and in a variety of institutions, and that educators in all parts of this spectrum can learn from practice elsewhere. The CDIO network therefore welcomes members in a diverse range of institutions ranging from research-led internationally acclaimed universities to local colleges dedicated to providing students with their initial grounding in engineering. The collaborators maintain a dialogue about what works and what does not and continue to refine the project. Determining additional members of the collaboration is a selective process managed by a Council comprising original members and early adopters. The CDIO revised syllabus consists of four parts: # Disciplinary knowledge and reasoning # Personal and professional skills and attributes # Interpersonal skills: teamwork and communication #

Mangala Samaraweera, is a Sri Lankan politician. He is a former Minister of Finance from 2017 to 2019, Minister of Foreign Affairs, for two terms from 2005 to 2007 and 2015 to 2017. He created a stir in Sri Lankan politics when he was sacked as a minister by President Mahinda Rajapakse in 2007, after which he formed a new political party called the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (Mahajana) Wing, which later merged with the United National Party in 2010.Daily Mirror, SLFP (M) unveils ‘policy’ ==Early life and education== Born to Mahanama Samaraweera and Khema Padmawathi Samaraweera née Amaraweera, his father was a cabinet Minister of Local Government, Housing, Communications, Posts and Telecommunications in Sirimavo Bandaranaike's government and his mother served as a member of the Matara Urban Council. Educated at Royal College, Colombo and at Walthamforest College, London, he gained a BA in Clothing Design and Technology from St. Martin's School of Art in London, he served as a design consultant to the National Design Center of Sri Lanka and served as a visiting lecturer in the Institute of Aesthetic Studies, University of Kelaniya. ==Political career== Samaraweera entered politics from the Sri Lanka Freedom Party as its chief organiser in Matara in 1983, thereafter becoming the party's Assistant Secretary and Coordinating Secretary of the Mother’s Front. He first entered the Parliament of Sri Lanka as a representative of the Matara District in 1989, and he was appointed as Minister of Post and Telecommunications in the cabinet of President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga in 1994. He also served as the Minister of Urban Development, Construction and Public Utilities in the same Cabinet after a reshuffle and was later given the Deputy Minister of Finance portfolio. Following the election defeat of his party in 2001, he was made the Chief Opposition Whip and the Treasurer of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party. In 2004 he became the Minister of Ports, Aviation and Media in the new cabinet of President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga. In June 2005, after conflicts with Kumaratunga, he dropped the Media Ministry, but remained Cabinet Minister of Ports and Aviation. He became the campaign manager for Presidential candidate and Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapakse. When Rajapakse won and took office in November 2005, he surprised many by appointing Samaraweera to the additional post of Foreign Minister instead of Prime Minister; Samaraweera maintained his other posts. In late January 2007, Samaraweera was replaced as Foreign Minister, but remained as Minister of Ports and Aviation.\\"Sri Lankan president reshuffles cabinet\\", Xinhua, January 29, 2007. On 9 February 2007, he was sacked from the cabinet together with ministers Anura Bandaranaike and Sripathi Sooriyarachchi after falling out with the president. He then went on to create a new political party, the SLFP (Mahajana) wing. In October 2013, the Matara Magistrate's Court issued a Court order to arrest him and 10 others for their alleged involvement in obstructing a peaceful protest march in Matara by UNP activists, to oust its leader Ranil Wickramasinghe. On 12 January 2015 Samaraweera was again appointed as Minister of Foreign Affairs under newly elected President Maithripala Sirisena. After the 2019 Presidential election, Samaraweera joined the newly form Samagi Jana Balawegaya which was launched in 2020 and led by opposition leader Sajith Premadasa. He resigned from the position of Finance minister as of 17 November 2019 even hours prior to release of the general election results. In June 2020, he announced that he would not contest at the upcoming 2020 parliamentary election which is scheduled to be held on 5 August 2020 and urged the public to not vote for his preferential number and revealed that it will be impossible to remove his name from nomination list. On 9 June 2020, he also announced that he will step back and quit parliamentary politics. == Controversies == In 2019, while being the finance minister he was accused of spreading hate speech and racist comments about Buddhism and monks urged immediate action against him for his comments about Buddhism. He also criticised honorable Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith in 2018 for Cardinal's comments on human rights and in 2019 Mangala blamed Cardinal for visiting a Buddhist monk who was fasting. He was accused of using Sri Lanka Transport Board buses to transport and locate voters for the 2019 Presidential election during his tenure as finance minister. ==Personal life== He is openly homosexual. In November 2018, after homophobic comments made by President Maithripala Sirisena, he wrote on Twitter that “I would rather be a butterfly than a leech Mr. President!!!” ==See also== *List of foreign ministers in 2017 *List of political families in Sri Lanka ==References== ==External links== * Mangala Samaraweera's Official Website * Mangala for democratic leadership in SLFP *UNESCO Executive Board *Parliament profile - Category:1956 births Category:Living people Category:Finance ministers of Sri Lanka Category:Foreign ministers of Sri Lanka Category:Sri Lankan Theravada Buddhists Category:Alumni of Royal College, Colombo Category:Members of the 9th Parliament of Sri Lanka Category:Members of the 10th Parliament of Sri Lanka Category:Members of the 11th Parliament of Sri Lanka Category:Members of the 12th Parliament of Sri Lanka Category:Members of the 13th Parliament of Sri Lanka Category:Members of the 14th Parliament of Sri Lanka Category:Members of the 15th Parliament of Sri Lanka Category:Sinhalese politicians Category:Alumni of Saint Martin's School of Art Category:People from Matara, Sri Lanka Category:Housing ministers of Sri Lanka Category:Posts ministers of Sri Lanka Category:Telecommunication ministers of Sri Lanka Category:LGBT politicians from Sri Lanka Category:Gay politicians Category:LGBT legislators ","title":"Mangala Samaraweera"},{"id":"3237007","text":"The brown woolly monkey, common woolly monkey, or Humboldt's woolly monkey (Lagothrix lagothricha) is a woolly monkey from Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Brazil. It lives in groups of two to 70 individuals, usually splitting the group into smaller subgroups when active. ==Taxonomy== The taxonomy of the brown woolly monkey is still debated. Fooden classified it is as one of two species under the genus Lagothrix with four sub-species (L. l. lagotricha, L. l. lugens, L. l. cana, and L. l. poeppgigii. Later, an analysis of craniodental morphology suggested a move of all sub-species to the species level and also led to the yellow-tailed woolly monkey (formerly Lagothrix flavicauda) being moved to a monotypic genus Oreonax. Genetic analyses also identify distinct groups, but different groupings from morphological and molecular data continue to make this a difficult issue that might be addressed with larger data sets. Many published sources use the specific name lagothricha rather than the etymologically correct lagotricha, since Fooden adopted this spelling when he revised the genus. Von Humboldt used both spellings in his original description of the species. == Description == A brown woolly monkey in Brazil Brown woolly monkeys are large compared to most other tree-dwelling primates, with a head-body length of , a tail length of , and a weight of . Contrary to their name, they may also be a shade of grey or black as well as brown, and are darker on the head and underparts. The face is naked of any fur and is typically black. Most male woolly monkeys are larger than the females, also having larger canines. Brown woolly monkeys are also diurnal. == Distribution and habitat == The species occurs in bordering areas of four different countries. It is found in the north-western region of Brazil and south of Venezuela, the northern region of Peru, the north-eastern region of Ecuador, and the south-eastern region of Colombia. In Ecuador, the range of inhabited altitudes is 200 - 1,400 m above sea level. == Diet == Like all species of woolly monkey, brown woolly monkeys are omnivorous, but mainly frugivorous. Their diet consists primarily of fruits containing 1 or 2 large seeds and fruits that are lower in fat and higher in sugar and water. Although they prefer certain fruits such as fruits from the Fabaceae (Legume), Moraceae (fig), Convolvulaceae, and Sapotaceae families, which represent roughly 50% of consumption time, fruit abundance and production influence their diet more than preference. As such, during periods of scarcity, fruit consumption tends to decrease and leaf and insect consumption increases. Females with dependents tend to eat more leaves, most likely because the leaves contain more protein, which helps the female produce more milk, whereas juvenile woolly monkeys have been observed to eat more arthropods than other members of the group. == Foraging behavior == The brown woolly monkey exhibits generalist and opportunistic foraging behavior, spending a large amount of time eating and moving in the pursuit of food, covering roughly 2 km per day. They tend to prefer fruit species with a clumped fruit distribution and fruits produced by large trees because these tend to produce a larger crop size and reduce the energy spent traveling between fruit patches. Females with offspring were observed to be more efficient foragers than juveniles and adult males. Inter- group competition during feeding times causes the juveniles to be displaced by the adult males and females with offspring resulting in an increase in feeding on arthropods and leaves. == Habitat and groups == The brown woolly monkey is present in the upper Amazon basin in South America, ranging from the Rio Tapajos in Brazil, to eastern Peru, Ecuador and Colombia. They also used to be found in Bolivia, however it is likely they have been extirpated by hunters. They are found in the rainforest, usually in the canopy of the tallest trees, though they may also be found at shrub layer. In certain seasons it is also common for groups to enter flooded forests, due to a higher concentration of berries. == Social behavior == === Inter-group interactions === Females drive the relationships that develop between opposite sexes within communities. They do not mingle with other females, whereas males will engage with either sex. Females are possessive of males and may harass others that try to interact with a male. Although they are dominant within their group, females are accepting to outsiders of both genders if there are no offspring-producing females present. === Movement and seed dispersal === Woolly monkeys have been observed using all four legs when walking/running and climbing, and efficiently making use of intermediate branches rather than just terminal branches when climbing. They act as more effective seed dispersers than the morphologically spider monkey due to longer seed retention time in the digestive tract and the higher variety of seeds eaten. Another influence on seed dispersal rate may be that insects constitute part of their diet. == Conservation == The brown woolly monkey is classified as a vulnerable species by the IUCN. It occurs both inside and outside of areas that are protected by national park laws. === Threats === Although the brown woolly monkey has the healthiest and most extensive populations of species in the genus Lagothrix, it is regarded as vulnerable because of predicted future pressures. Human activity is the biggest threat for this species, particularly the building of new highways through parts of the Amazon and the attendant deforestation and increase in human activity. This leads to displacement and provides new access into the forests, creating the opportunity for more hunting to occur. Hunting is mostly carried out by the indigenous communities of this region of the Amazon. Its large size makes the brown woolly monkey highly susceptible to being hunted by locals. Individuals may also be sold locally as pets. After the mothers are hunted, the babies can be sold for up to approximately $80 USD. Declining populations of woolly monkeys may have wider ecosystem impacts due to their function as seed dispersers and their role as both predator and prey. === Conservation projects === Many South American national parks have specific laws that prevent both deforestation and the hunting of animals, whereas some do not forbid hunting. Parks and reserves that fully protect the brown woolly monkey include Sumaco-Napo Galeras National Park, Cayambe-Coca and Cofán-Bermejo Ecological Reserve and Cuyabeno Wildlife Reserve in Ecuador; Nevado de Huila, Puracé, Cueva de los Guacharos and Picachos Natural National Parks in Colombia; and Majuna-Kichwa and Yaguas Reserved Zone in Peru. Algodón Medio Putumayo and Bajo Putumayo-Yagua in Peru offer partial protection. It has been suggested that the local extirpation of the species in some parts of its former range in Brazil was caused by the lack of hunting laws enforced upon indigenous groups. ==References== brown woolly monkey Category:Mammals of Brazil Category:Mammals of Peru Category:Mammals of Ecuador Category:Mammals of Colombia brown woolly monkey ","title":"Brown woolly monkey"},{"id":"3237024","text":"R v Manninen [1987] 1 S.C.R. 1233 is a leading Supreme Court of Canada decision on an accused Charter right to retain and instruct a lawyer (section 10(b)) as well as the right to silence (section 24(2)). ==Background== In October 1982, Ronald Charles Manninen robbed a local Mac's Milk store in downtown Toronto and escaped in a recently stolen car. The store owner reported to the police that the individual who robbed him had a knife and wore a grey hoodie. Two days later, two plainclothes police officers arrested Manninen at a simonizing store for theft, armed robbery, and possession of a stolen car. They read him his rights twice. Manninen said that he was not going to say anything until he consulted his lawyer. Even though there was a phone nearby, at no point did the police make any effort to allow him to contact his lawyer. Instead, they proceeded to ask questions, and at one point they say: :Q. Where is the knife that you had along with this (showing the respondent the CO2 gun found in the car) when you ripped off the Mac's Milk on Wilson Avenue? :A. He's lying. When I was in the store I only had the gun. The knife was in the tool box in the car. This statement became the basis of his conviction at trial. Manninen appealed on the basis that the questions violated his rights to counsel under section 10(b) as they did not provide him with the opportunity to call a lawyer and due to the violation the evidence obtained in violating his right should be excluded under section 24(2). The Court of Appeal agreed and overturned his conviction. ==Reasons of the court== Lamer, writing for a unanimous Court, upheld the decision of the Court of Appeal and held that Manninen's section 10(b) Charter right was violated and the evidence should be excluded. Lamer identified two duties of the police officer when effecting an arrest. \\"First, the police must provide the detainee with a reasonable opportunity to exercise the right to retain and instruct counsel without delay\\". This further requires that the police facilitate contact with a lawyer by giving him access to a phone. Lamer suggests that the only situation where this would be excused would be in situations of urgency in continuing the investigation. However, there was no such situation here. Second, the police must \\"cease questioning or otherwise attempting to elicit evidence from the detainee until he has had a reasonable opportunity to retain and instruct counsel.\\" The right to silence will only be effective if the accused is able to be informed of his or her rights by a lawyer prior to any questioning, and so ceasing questions is integral to the right to silence. Lamer briefly considered whether Manninen had implicitly waived his rights at any time but found no such act. Given the violation, Lamer held that it should be excluded as the statement's inclusion would bring the administration of justice into disrepute under the Collins test. The violation was severe as it proved the basis of his conviction. As well, there was no justification as there was no urgency. == Final Decision == The appeal was later dismissed with a vote of 8 to 1. ==External links== * Category:Canadian criminal procedure case law Category:Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms case law Category:Supreme Court of Canada cases Category:1987 in Canadian case law Category:Supreme Court of Canada case articles without infoboxes Category:Canadian evidence case law ","title":"R v Manninen"},{"id":"3237027","text":"The white-bellied spider monkey (Ateles belzebuth), also known as the white- fronted or long-haired spider monkey, is an endangered species of spider monkey, a type of New World monkey. It is found in the north-western Amazon in Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela, Peru and Brazil, ranging as far south as the lower Ucayali River and as far east as the Branco River. In the past, the Peruvian, brown and white-cheeked spider monkeys have been treated as subspecies of A. belzebuth. As presently defined, the white-bellied spider monkey is monotypic. It has a whitish belly and a pale patch on the forehead, which, despite its common name, often is orange-buff.Sumac Muyu Foundation (2009). Photo of Ateles belzebuth. Flickrraskin227 (2009). Photo of Ateles belzebuth. Flickr They live in groups of 20 to 40 individuals, splitting into small parties of 1 to 9 when in activity. Vernacular names include mono prieto, mico prieto and marimonda (Colombia). Over the last 45 years (3 generations), the population has declined by approximately 50% due to habitat loss and hunting. Because of this, A. belzebuth is listed as endangered by the IUCN. == Ecology == White-bellied spider monkeys are important long-distance seed dispersal agents for many fruit-bearing species. They are a dominant disperser for Oenocarpus bataua, a species of palm. A. belzebuth often occupies a large territory and will utilize multiple nesting trees throughout their territory. Seeds of preferred species are often dispersed below sleeping trees. They live in social groups that operate using fission-fusion dynamics. These groups are characterized by fragmenting into subgroups that travel, feed and sleep together. These groups display great fluidity and will often change composition, sometimes changing several times each day. The composition of these groups can be influenced by the reproductive status of females. Females are usually more solitary than males, but females with dependent offspring are more likely to join a large group than those without dependent offspring. Females will also usually remain in small core ranges within their home territories with their offspring while males will utilize more of their home range. These subgroups are brought together with long distance vocalizations. These long distance vocalizations can be up to a kilometer away. There is no evidence of secondary dispersal in wild spider monkeys. Therefore, males in these groups are closely related to each other. == Reproduction == White- bellied spider monkeys are believed to achieve sexual maturity at between 4 and 5 years of age and will usually produce a single offspring although females giving birth to twins has been reported. Their gestation period is between 226 and 232 days long. Males have been observed engaging in infanticide. All victims of observed infanticide were from the same social group as their attackers and all were young males. == Feeding == The diet of White-bellied spider monkeys is 83% mature fruits and they are important to the seed dispersal of many fruit-bearing species. They carry a relatively high number of intact seeds in their gut and intake relatively large amounts of fruit pulp when compared to some other monkey species within their range. They also are likely to return to previous food sources and spend relatively little time foraging. A. belzebuth is a generalist frugivore that doesn't specialize in a particular fruit type but do appear to prefer fruits with high lipid content, high sugar content, or fruits produced by trees with high fruit productivity. They will also feed on other plant parts such as leaves, flowers, and bulbs, and will very rarely consume small insects. A. belzebuth has also been observed engaging in geophagy. == Locomotion == All members of Ate), and this species has an intermembral index of 105. They have a fairly dorsally placed scapula to allow for increased mobility involved in brachiation. Their prehensile tail with a hairless gripping pad at the end also allows for their mobility, which then means they have increased caudal vertebrae, with about 31 caudal vertebrae as opposed to another platyrrhine like Cebus with only 23 on average. This tail allows for additional grasping of branches, which means there is less lateral movement while brachiating which increases efficiency. The hairless gripping pad of the underside of the tip of their tail is often compared to a finger, since it allows surface gripping. Their curved hands with long metacarpal bones allows for easy brachiation. They do not have an external thumb, which sets them apart from most other primates. ==Dentition== Spider monkey in Ecuador. Ateles belzebuth has a dental formula of 2.1.3.3. As far as patterns within the teeth, there is a lot of variation but the following are often found within Ateles. Larger incisors and small molars reflect the largely frugivorous diet, with a diastema separating the upper canines from the upper incisors, for the lower incisor. The upper premolars have one to two cusps, with the first premolar having only one cusp, a paracone. The second premolar has a paracone and protocone cusp connected by transverse crest. The third premolar has three cusps, paracone, metacone, and protocone, with the metacone and protocone connected by a crista oblique. There is a recorded hypocone on the third premolar. In the bottom premolars, the first premolar has one cusp although it can be bicuspid.

Construction of Morrissy bridge began in 1913 and was completed and opened in November 1914. Named after Hon. John Morrissy, the Minister of Public Works, it was hailed as \\"one of the greatest structures in the province\\", and provided the first fixed road link between the former town of Newcastle and communities on the south side of the river. The bridge created a new obstacle for navigation, but a swing span in the bridge allowed large vessels to pass. The Morrissy Bridge was badly damaged on 5 November 1971 when the Panamanian registered Liberty Ship Grand Valor struck the second pier of the bridge while departing the Newcastle Wharf with a load of pulpwood. Several heavy trusses were knocked out and the swing span was moved off its bearing pad. Repairs took three weeks and the vessel was arrested and later released. The swing span is no longer used, and the narrow deck of the bridge is now viewed as substandard. The new Miramichi Bridge completed in 1995 provides a wider, safer crossing only 1 km upstream. It has created a newer, permanent obstacle to upstream navigation. In 2008 the New Brunswick Department of TransportationDoT Morrissy Bridge to close permanently carried out a detailed structural analysis and concluded that the bridge's steel deck supports had corroded to the point where the bridge was no longer safe for use.

He served as a Toronto city councillor and was vice-chairman of the Toronto Transit Commission in the 1990s. He served on the board of GO Transit from 2000 to 2006 including periods as vice-chairman of GO Transit and chairman. He was also the final chair of the Greater Toronto Services Board (2001). ==Biography== Chong was born on October 28, 1943 in Toronto to a Chinese father, Joseph Chong and white mother of British ancestry whose family disowned her when she married a Chinese man. He grew up in the city's original Chinatown around Elizabeth Street and Dundas Street. A dentist by profession (formerly with Yorkville Dental Associates), and a founding director of the Federation of Chinese-Canadian Professionals, Chong was encouraged to enter municipal politics by Metro Chairman Paul Godfrey, whom he met at a block party, and represented downtown Toronto's Ward 6 (which included the Financial District, University of Toronto, and Chinatown) on both Metro Council and Toronto City Council from 1980 until the 1982 election when he was defeated in the two-councillor ward by former mayor John Sewell and newcomer Jack Layton. Chong returned to dentistry but in 1994 returned to Metro Toronto Council as Metro Councillor (and Toronto City Councillor from 1997 onwards) for Ward 11 Don Parkway, in suburban North York, until 2000 when he retired from electoral politics and became the founding chairman of the province's Social Housing Services Corporation. At various times in his municipal career, Chong also served as chairman of the Metro Toronto Housing Authority and as a member of the Toronto Police Services Board. In the 1987 provincial election, Chong was a Progressive Conservative candidate in York Mills, losing by 3000 votes to Liberal Brad Nixon. In 2010 he served as a part of new mayor Rob Ford's transition team.Royson James. \\"Ford backers to get plum jobs in new regime\\" Toronto Star Nov 15 2010 In 2011, he was appointed to head up the Toronto Transit Commission’s consulting subsidiary at a $100,000 yearly salary, raising controversy about Ford's recruitment and hiring practices. His recommendations for road tolls or a congestion charge to pay for an extension to the Sheppard subway were rejected. Chong later endorsed the construction of a Sheppard East LRT instead of a subway. Chong had also been involved with the Toronto Head Tax Action Committee, a group, a group which lobbied for an official apology and redress for the head tax imposed on Chinese migrants to Canada from 1885 to 1923. He also served as chair of the board of the YMCA of Greater Toronto and served as a citizenship judge. Chong was a Toronto Sun columnist at the time of his death and had previously written a column for the Toronto Star and op/ed pieces for the National Post. He died at the age of 74 in palliative care after having suffered from a heart condition for several years. He was married to civil servant Shirley Hoy, who had been his partner since the late 1990s, and previously to Lorinne Matsui for 31 years. ==References== Category:1943 births Category:2018 deaths Category:Metro Toronto councillors Category:Canadian politicians of Chinese descent Category:Toronto city councillors Category:University of Toronto alumni Category:Canadian dentists Category:Canadian people of Chinese descent ","title":"Gordon Chong"},{"id":"3237037","text":"Sofala is a village in New South Wales, Australia, north-west of Sydney, within Bathurst Regional Council.

He played college football for the University of North Carolina, and earned All-American honors. He was drafted by the Cincinnati Bengals 17th overall in the 1998 NFL Draft, and he played professionally for the Bengals and New Orleans Saints of the NFL. ==Early years== Simmons was born in New Bern, North Carolina.

Right before the halftime, the Ravens were driving down field. They were on the goal line, and threw into the end zone. Brian Simmons picked off the pass, which led to Cincinnati's 21-10 win. In 2003, the 1-4 Bengals were down 0–7 against the Ravens. With the Ravens about to score again, Simmons sacked rookie quarterback Kyle Boller, which forced a fumble, and led to Jon Kitna's 45-yard touchdown pass on third down. The Bengals won 34–26. A week later, the Bengals were 2-4 and were protecting a 27-24 lead against the Seattle Seahawks in the last six minutes. Simmons deflected a Matt Hasselbeck pass at the Cincinnati 34, then deflected another at the 24, which was intercepted by cornerback Jeff Burris to win the game. In 2004, for the home season opener, the Bengals were down against the Miami Dolphins 0–3 at halftime. Three minutes into the second half, Simmons intercepted an A. J.

It occurs in southern Espírito Santo and possibly northern Rio de Janeiro and its distribution extends into Minas Gerais.Rylands, A. B., et al. The Systematics and Distributions of the Marmosets. In Ford, S. M., et al., Eds. (2009). The Smallest Anthropoids: The Marmoset/Callimico Radiation. Springer 40. ==Description== Buffy-headed marmoset in Feliciano Miguel Abdala Reserve, Brazil. The average weight of an adult buffy-headed marmoset can range in weight anywhere between 119g to 710g. These marmosets have a low metabolic rate, as well as an enlarged cecum that allows consumption of food that is high in fiber. ==Ecology and Behavior== Due to their small size, buffy-headed marmosets are susceptible to a wide range of predators. Common threats include ocelots, anacondas, and hawks, but many other animals such as toucans prey on them. The buffy-headed marmoset has four distinct patterns of predator avoidance. Primarily, buffy-headed marmosets avoid aerial predators through low-intensity alarm signals, emitting soft, closed-mouth whistles to warn other group members. A secondary behavior in dealing with aerial threats is a high-intensity alarm. These marmosets will send out a half-mouthed, open whistle to alert other members to take cover under branches or trees, sometimes immediately ceasing movement for the purpose of avoiding exposure. This pattern of avoidance is instinctive, and at times can result in these primates leaping downward from canopy to canopy in 10m jumps. The third type of anti-predator alarm is for low-intensity terrestrial threats. A few marmosets in the group will give a call to the rest, alerting them of a possible threat such as a snake. The buffy-headed marmosets then proceed to “mob” the predator by amassing in large groups, thus giving an incentive for the predator to not attack. Low calls, often made with the intention of frightening the predator, are a technique that is surprisingly effective. When dealing with threats such as raccoons, they will do so, but maintain their distance from 15–20 m away. The last reaction is one for high-intensity terrestrial situations. In instances of dealing with larger or more threatening predators, such as the tayra, the buffy-headed marmosets amass in a large group, yelping in piercingly loud manner to try and scare the predator away. Distinct vocalizations are used depending on whether they are for inter- group communication of extra-group communication. For inter-group communication, a short-distance call is used, while for an extra-group communication call, a loud, shrill long-distance call is used.Orlandoni, S., Mendes, SL. Veracini, C. (2009) “Individual and Gender Differences in Vocalizations of a Wild Group of the Buffy-Headed Marmoset (Callithrix flaviceps)” Folia Primatologica Volume: 80 Issue: 6 P.375 Specific vocalizations are used when an adult buffy-headed marmoset discovers a source of food with others. Younger ones respond by running towards the calling marmoset, while expressing vocalizations of excitement. The dominant female will sometimes also express these vocalizations of excitement. If the food is not given, the female and younger marmosets will stay near the adult buffy- headed marmoset while conveying short vocalizations, to display their presence and express a need for food.Orlandoni, S., Mendes, SL. Veracini, C. (2009) “Vocalizations in a Food Sharing Contest in a Wild Group of Buffy-Headed Marmosets (Callithrix flaviceps)” Folia Primatologica Volume: 80 Issue: 6 P. 392 A ===Diet=== The buffy-headed marmoset is known primarily for eating fruits, gum, and plant exudates. A small portion of their diet is composed of bird eggs and nestlings. While most marmosets are known for being gummivorous, the buffy-headed marmoset is predominantly mycophagous-insectivorous. Additionally, they may prey on both vertebrates and invertebrates: primarily orthopterans, phasmids, coleopterans, caterpillars, and tree frogs.Hilario, Renato R., and Stephen F. Ferrari. \\"Feeding Ecology of a Group of Buffy-headed Marmosets (Callithrix Flaviceps): Fungi as a Preferred Resource.\\" Infodoctor.org. American Journal of Primatology, June 2010. Web. 26 Oct. 2012. . ====Fungi==== Often found at the base of bamboo, fungi are also known to be included in the diet of buffy-headed-marmosets. Because this group of marmosets primarily inhabits areas in which fungi are abundant, it tends to be a consistent source of sustenance throughout the year. Fruits and exudates vary seasonally, and thus are not as readily available, nor as frequently consumed. Fungi, when present, are typically preferred by the buffy-headed marmosets, and likely more nutritious by comparison to their other dietary components. ==See also== *Feliciano Miguel Abdala Private Natural Heritage Reserve ==References== == External links == * ARKive - images and movies of the Buffy-headed marmoset (Callithrix flaviceps) ==Further reading== *Ferrari, S.

She first appeared in Razor Annual #1 (1993) and has appeared in numerous books by various publishers ever since, most notably Tucci's own Crusade Comics. Shi is a young woman of Japanese and American descent trained as a Yamabushi warrior monk, who struggles to reconcile her Japanese grandfather's martial training with her American mother's Christian teachings. Japanese culture and spiritual themes are prominent, recurring motifs in storylines featuring her, especially as they pertain to this conflict. The word shi literally translates to death (死) in Japanese, and Shi's signature weapon is the naginata. ==Fictional character biography== Ana's father, Shiro, was a Japanese warrior; her mother, Catherine, is an American Catholic missionary. As a child, Ana witnessed the brutal murder of her father and brother at the hands of Masahiro Arashi, an upstart Yakuza thug. Following this horrifying incident, Ana was consequently spirited away and raised by her grandfather, Yoshitora, amongst the sacred temples of Kyoto. Yoshitora secretly trained Ana in the ways of the sohei (warrior monks of feudal Japan), so that she could seek out Arashi and avenge the deaths of her father and brother. Arashi wanted to impress the leaders of the Osaka crime syndicate and left a calling card with every murder he committed—a simple coin engraved with the kanji for death; shi. Whilst holding onto the coins left with the bodies of her father and brother, Ana developed a vengeful obsession, as she completely gave herself to shi, becoming the living embodiment of Death. Ana swore revenge on the Yakuza and set out to become one of the deadliest assassins in the world. In order to disguise herself, Ana painted her face white to resemble Tora No Shi (also known as Tiger of Death), a legendary female warrior of medieval Japan. Ana acquired the name Shi because of her ferocity and ruthlessness. However, Ana was deeply affected by her mother's Catholic teachings; she soon faced a dilemma between her programmed mission of revenge and the Christian faith she secretly harbored. Once her parents' killer, Arashi, was sent to prison, Ana renounced killing and became the manager of an art gallery in New York. From time to time, she still takes on her Shi personality if necessary. Even with the duality that rages in Ana's soul, she will not allow herself to succumb to the death demon that terrorizes her. In the end, it is Ana's faith and the ethereal visions of her sohei ancestors that shepherd her along the way of the warrior. ==Powers and abilities== Ana was trained by her grandfather in the ways of the sohei. As such, she is a skilled martial artist and swordswoman, the naginata being her weapon of choice. ==Merchandise== Through William Tucci's Crusade Fine Arts, Shi has been printed in four languages. A series of limited edition 1/6 scale figures was released by Executive Replicas in 2017. ==Tora no Shi== In the first series Shi: the Way of the Warrior, Ana based her look on \\"Tora no Shi\\", a famous female warrior from Feudal Japan. That person is Yuri Ishikawa, actual ancestor of Ana, who wears a similar outfit and starred her own miniseries (Shi: Tora no Shi and Avatar Press' Shi: Poisoned Paradise), who fought against Musashi Miyamoto in Tora no Shi and Ieyasu Tokugawa in Poisoned Paradise, being Yuri part of the Japanese Christian resistance. ==Film adaptation== In 1997, there were plans to make a motion picture based on Shi, with Tia Carrere as Shi/Ana Ishikawa and Tucci writing the script. In 2002, the movie was optioned by producer Mimi Polk Gitlin with Tucci still on the script but with Kevin Bernhardt co-writing it and with no lead role defined. ==Publications== ===Primary=== *Shi: The Way of the Warrior #1–12 (1994–1997) *Shi vs. Tomoe **Tomoe #1–3 (drawn by Amanda Conner) *Shi: Tora No Shi #1–3 *Shi: Senryaku #1-3 (1995) *Shi: Kaidan (1996) *Manga Shi 2000 #1-3 (1997) *Shi: East Wind Rain (1997) *Shi: The Series #0-13 (1997-1998) *Shi: Heaven & Earth #1–4 (1997) *Shi: Rekishi #1-2 (1997) *Shi: Nightstalkers (1997) *Shi: Black, White and Red #1-2 (1998) *Shi: 5th Anniversary Special (1999) *Shi: Zero (2000) *Shi: Year of the Dragon #0-3 (2000) *Shi: Akai (2001) *Shi: Through the Ashes (2001, special issue made after 9/11) *Shi: Poisoned Paradise #0–2 (with Karl Waller, Avatar Press, 2002) *Shi: The Illustrated Warrior #1-7 (2002-2003) *Shi: Sempo (4-issue miniseries, 2003, Avatar Press) *Shi: Ju-Nen (4-issue miniseries, 2004–2005; 104 page trade paperback, Dark Horse Comics, 2006, ) *Shi: Return of the Warrior (graphic novel, 2017) *Definitive Shi: The Essential Warrior Vol. 1 (576 pages, Crusade Fine Arts, 2006) ===Crossover=== *Avengelyne/Shi *Image comics/GEN 13 - Number 13C *Cyblade/Shi and Shi/Cyblade (The Battle for Independents) (1995) *Daredevil/Shi and Shi/Daredevil (1997) *Fallen Angel (IDW)/Shi (Fallen Angel Vol. 2 Nos. 17–19) *Grifter/Shi: Final Rites #1–2 (1996) *Razor & Shi Special (1994) *Lethargic Comics #12 (1994) *Shi/Vampirella *Vampirella/Shi *Vampirella #7–9 *Lady Death/Shi #0–2 *Wolverine/Shi: Dark Night of Judgment (2000) *Tenth Muse/Shi: Bluewater One Shot (2007) *Jetta/Shi: Arrow Of Destiny (2008) ==References== ==Reviews== *Year of the Dragon #1, #2 and #3 *Poisoned Paradise #1 and #2 ==External links== * A short biography * Shi in Avatar Press * Shi in Comic Vine * Shi in Comic Book DB * Crusade-fan.com Category:Avatar Press titles Category:Comic martial artists Category:Comics characters introduced in 1993 Category:Dark Horse Comics titles Category:Fictional melee weapons practitioners Category:Female characters in comics ","title":"Shi (comics)"},{"id":"3237084","text":"Michael Denis McAuliffePalmer, Tim. \\"Drug smuggler Michael McAuliffe hanged in Malaysia in 1993.\\" ABC News Australia.

The former army reserve soldier, who had been living in Manly, Sydney, was convicted in the Malaysian High Court in Penang on 17 August 1991. An appeal was lodged with the Malaysian Supreme Court. Karpal Singh acted as McAuliffe's counsel at the appeal, at which 28 arguments were presented. One argument was that the original trial judge had criticised McAuliffe for failing to disclose his defense after his arrest. (This defense was that McAuliffe believed he was carrying \\"bang bang powder\\", an aphrodisiac given to him by a Thai dance hostess.) Karpal argued that the original judge's criticism had drawn an adverse inference of guilt on McAuliffe. The appeal court heard that what the original judge did was point out that McAuliffe had failed to disclose this defence of carrying an aphrodisiac to the officer who recorded a statement from him after his arrest. It was found that the judge had not drawn an inference of guilt from this. The appeal was rejected 13 May 1992. McAuliffe's family asked Malaysian authorities and the Australian government not to publicise his case. McAuliffe was executed in Kajang Prison in Kajang, Selangor, in the Kuala Lumpur metropolitan area. ==See also== * List of Australians in international prisons * Ronald Ryan * Van Tuong Nguyen ==References== Category:1993 deaths Category:Australian drug traffickers Category:Australian people executed abroad Category:Executed Australian people Category:People executed by Malaysia by hanging Category:People executed for drug offences Category:People from Sydney Category:Year of birth missing ","title":"Michael McAuliffe (drug trafficker)"},{"id":"3237088","text":" The Lancair IV and IV-P are a family of four-seat low-wing retractable- gear composite monoplanes powered by a 550 cubic inch Continental TSIO-550 twin-turbocharged piston engine.Vandermeullen, Richard: 2011 Kit Aircraft Buyer's Guide, Kitplanes, Volume 28, Number 12, December 2011, page 59.

Adults have been reported to weigh anything from . Its physical form is similar to that of other marmosets, with lower canines that barely protrude above the line of the incisors and claws (rather than nails) on all of their digits except for the big toe. It most closely resembles the Maués marmoset in appearance, differing in having paler fur and in the shape of the ear tassels. Males and females are similar in size. The scientific name \\"humeralifer\\" roughly translates as \\"wearing a shoulder cape\\" and refers to the mantle of light grey fur that covers the animal's shoulders. There are also patches of whitish fur on the hips, but otherwise the body is black with irregular grey spots over the back and flanks, and yellowish on the underparts. The limbs are black, apart from grey fur stretching down over the outer surface of the upper arms from the mantle. The non-prehensile tail is long and ringed with black and grey; all but one other species in the genus Mico lack these distinctive tail rings. The face is dark in colour, with a greyish forehead and patches of pink skin around the eyes and mouth. The area around and between the eyes also has relatively little fur compared with other parts of the head and body. Like many marmosets, there are large tufts of fur on the ears, but the Santarem marmoset is one of only a few species in which the fur sprouts from both the outer and inner surfaces of the pinna. The tufts are buff to grey in colour and, as the alternative common name implies, have a tassel-like shape that extends sideways from the head. ==Distribution and habitat== The Santarem marmoset is found only in a very restricted area between the Tapajós river in the east, the lower Madeira and Roosevelt rivers in the west, and the Amazon River in the north. The southern limit of its range is unknown, but is likely to be in the general region of the Paracari River. There are no recognised subspecies. It inhabits lowland rainforest, and is common in secondary forest. ==Biology and behaviour== Like other members of its genus, the Santarem marmoset travels in the lower parts of the forest canopy, and feed primarily on fruit and insects, supplementing its diet with small lizards and frogs and with gum gouged from trees. They live in small family groups, with about six members being typical, although groups of up to fifteen individuals have been reported. They make long calls with their tongue vibrating rapidly, said to resemble the sound of a cricket, and also shorter chirps. Like most other marmosets, they normally give birth to non-identical twins twice per year. Juveniles are said to have black stripe along the head and hairy, but not tufted, ears. ==References== Santarem marmoset Category:Mammals of Brazil Category:Endemic fauna of Brazil Santarem marmoset ","title":"Santarem marmoset"},{"id":"3237109","text":"The Maués marmoset (Mico mauesi) is a marmoset endemic to Brazil.

Thunderbunny made a subsequent appearance in that title's 10th issue. The character then moved briefly to Archie Comics, appearing in Thunderbunny #1 as part of Red Circle Comics, a short-lived revival of the Archie Comics superhero characters. Thunderbunny appeared in Blue Ribbon Comics #13 (Oct.1984), co- starring in a story also featuring the Fly, the Shield, the Web and the Jaguar, The All New Adventures of the Mighty Crusaders #7, and Pep Comics #393 (March 1984). Thunderbunny then moved to WaRP Graphics for a six-issue run (June 1985 – Feb. 1986), with an additional story in Warp Graphics Annual #1. Issues #7–12 were published by Apple Comics (Apr. 1986 – Nov. 1987). ==Character history== Thunderbunny was the last survivor of an alien race of humanoid animals. The essence of this world's greatest hero was transferred into a special box-shaped device and subtly presented to a young boy named Bobby Caswell. When Bobby placed his hands in two hand-shaped impressions on the box, power transferred into his body and gave him the ability to transform into Thunderbunny. His powers include super-strength and flight. Bobby finds the bunny form to be embarrassing. Furthermore, the longer he stays in that form, the more difficult it is to form the essential mental image of his original form to change back. This combination of concerns makes him most reluctant to use his superhero identity, but he has still had adventures as Thunderbunny. ==See also== *Hoppy the Marvel Bunny ==References== ==External links== *Thunderbunny's page at International Superheroes Category:Charlton Comics superheroes Category:WaRP Graphics titles Category:1982 comics debuts Category:Comics characters introduced in 1982 Category:Fictional hares and rabbits Category:Animal superheroes Category:Archie Comics superheroes Category:Archie Comics titles Category:Comics about rabbits and hares ","title":"Thunderbunny"},{"id":"3237129","text":"The Emilia's marmoset (Mico emiliae), also known as Snethlage's marmoset, is a marmoset endemic to Brazil.Emmons, L & Feer, F.

In response to encroachment by American gold prospectors and ranchers, leaders of his tribe ceded their traditional homelands to settle on a reservation in Oregon, jointly occupied by the Klamath and Yahooskin Band of Snake Indians in 1864. Reservation life was difficult for the Modoc, due to a neglectful and corrupt Indian agent and continual harassment by the Klamath.

Informally, a differentiable function is pseudoconvex if it is increasing in any direction where it has a positive directional derivative. ==Formal definition== Formally, a real-valued differentiable function f defined on a (nonempty) convex open set X in the finite-dimensional Euclidean space \\\\mathbb{R}^nis said to be pseudoconvex if, for all x,y \\\\in Xsuch that abla f(x)\\\\cdot(y-x) \\\\ge 0, we have f(y)\\\\ge f(x). Here abla f is the gradient of f, defined by : abla f = \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial x_1},\\\\dots,\\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial x_n}\\\\right). ==Properties== Every convex function is pseudoconvex, but the converse is not true. For example, the function is pseudoconvex but not convex. Any pseudoconvex function is quasiconvex, but the converse is not true since the function is quasiconvex but not pseudoconvex. Pseudoconvexity is primarily of interest because a point x* is a local minimum of a pseudoconvex function ƒ if and only if it is a stationary point of ƒ, which is to say that the gradient of ƒ vanishes at x*: : abla f(x^*) = 0. ==Generalization to nondifferentiable functions== The notion of pseudoconvexity can be generalized to nondifferentiable functions as follows. Given any function we can define the upper Dini derivative of ƒ by :f^+(x,u) = \\\\limsup_{h\\\\to 0^+} \\\\frac{f(x+hu) - f(x)}{h} where u is any unit vector. The function is said to be pseudoconvex if it is increasing in any direction where the upper Dini derivative is positive. More precisely, this is characterized in terms of the subdifferential ∂ƒ as follows: *For all , if there exists an such that \\\\langle x^* , y - x \\\\rangle \\\\ge 0 \\\\,, then for all z on the line segment adjoining x and y. ==Related notions== A ' is a function whose negative is pseudoconvex. A ' is a function that is both pseudoconvex and pseudoconcave. For example, linear–fractional programs have pseudolinear objective functions and linear–inequality constraints: These properties allow fractional–linear problems to be solved by a variant of the simplex algorithm (of George B. Dantzig). Chapter five: Given a vector-valued function η, there is a more general notion of η-pseudoconvexity and η-pseudolinearity wherein classical pseudoconvexity and pseudolinearity pertain to the case when η(x, y) = y - x. ==See also== * Pseudoconvexity * Convex function * Quasiconvex function ==Notes== ==References== * . * . * Category:Convex analysis Category:Convex optimization Category:Types of functions Category:Generalized convexity ","title":"Pseudoconvex function"},{"id":"3237133","text":"Catnic Components Ltd. v. Hill & Smith Ltd. [1982] R.P.C. 183 is a leading House of Lords decision on the nature of a patent and in particular the methods of claim construction. ==Background== Catnic Components had a patent for a steel lintel, used to provide structural support over a door or window opening in a brick wall. The lintel is hollow, being made from sheet steel pressed into a rectangular or trapezoidal shape with a wind to anchor the device to the surrounding brickwork. Part of the specification required a bar to \\"extend vertically\\". Hill & Smith created a virtually identical invention that had a bar that extended at an upwards slant, only 6 or 8 degrees from being completely vertical. Despite the difference the device worked entirely in the same way as Catnic's invention. Catnic sued for patent infringement. At trial, the judge held there was an infringement under the \\"pith and marrow\\" doctrine. The Court of Appeal of England and Wales overturned the ruling as it held that the \\"vertical\\" requirement was an exact and essential element of the patent. The Law Lords reversed the decision of the Court of Appeal, finding that there was an infringement, and affirmed the use of purposive construction in patent interpretation.Jacob, R., Alexander, D., Lane, L. (2004) A Guidebook to Intellectual Property: Patents Trade Marks, Copyright and Designs, 5th Edition, Thomson, Sweet and Maxwell, London, p.33 ==Opinion of the Court== Lord Diplock held that a patent must be read in a \\"purposive\\" manner that focuses on the essential features of the patent. He famously stated: :My Lords, a patent specification is a unilateral statement by the patentee, in words of his own choosing, addressed to those likely to have a practical interest in the subject matter of his invention (i.e. \\"skilled in the art\\"), by which he informs them what he claims to be the essential features of the new product or process for which the letters patent grant him a monopoly. It is called \\"pith and marrow\\" of the claim. A patent specification should be given a purposive construction rather than a purely literal one derived from applying to it the kind of meticulous verbal analysis in which lawyers are too often tempted by their training to indulge. The question in each case is: whether persons with practical knowledge and experience of the kind of work in which the invention was intended to be used, would understand that strict compliance with a particular descriptive word or phrase appearing in a claim was intended by the patentee to be an essential requirement of the invention so that any variant would fall outside the monopoly claimed, even though it could have no material effect upon the way the invention worked. ==See also== * Doctrine of equivalents * Improver v Remington (1990) * Kirin-Amgen v Hoechst Marion Roussel (2004) ==References== Category:House of Lords cases Category:United Kingdom patent case law Category:1982 in British law Category:1982 in case law ","title":"Catnic Components Ltd v Hill &amp; Smith Ltd"},{"id":"3237136","text":"Pablo the Little Red Fox is a British-French animated series which originally ran from March 1999 until 2015 on CBBC and CBeebies. The hero is a little red fox called Pablo and his siblings called Pumpkin and Poppy, their parents, Red Fox and Rose, a dog named Baxter, a hedgehog named Helena, a cat named Finbar, a frog called Fromage, a seagull called Gil and an owl named Madam Owl. The action often takes place at night, when the three little fox cubs go out and explore the city, from circus tents, artist's studios and the local museum. Pablo often leads them astray but somehow they always get out of trouble and find a way back home, to their cosy den at the bottom of Hannah's garden. The graphic style of the cartoons has intense colours and white outlines, reminiscent of silk paintings and Hannah Giffard's original water colour illustrations. The series concept was created by Hannah Giffard, the writer and illustrator of the original books called 'Red Fox' and 'Red Fox on the move' published by Frances Lincoln. Hannah Giffard worked closely on the series as an editor and creator of many of the story lines. She also worked with the art director and director to create the characters and backgrounds for the series. The theme music was composed by Rowland Lee, the lyrics were written by John Grace (who was a writer for the show), and was sung by Clewborough House School, Camberley. The show won a BAFTA in 2000 for best international children's program. At one point, the show aired on Playhouse Disney as part of their Mini Movies interstitials and PBS Kids Sprout.

It has a very wide diet; it eats plants, fruits, flowers, nectar, insects and small invertebrates; which include insect larvae, spiders, snails, frogs, lizards, bird eggs and small snakes. Typically, fruits are eaten shortly after awaking, as the fruit sugars provide quick energy for hunting later on. It searches for animal prey within epiphytic bromeliads; if its home range does not contain many bromeliads, then it will also forage in crevices, holes in trees, between palm fronds and in leaf litter. It occasionally eats gum, but this behavior is rare in this species of tamarin. Since its habitat is fairly stable within the rainforest, its preferred food is available year-round and they do not need to resort to the low nutritional value of exudates. == Behavior == The study showed that in the wild the golden-headed lion tamarin spends about 50% of its time in only 11% of its home range. Its ranging patterns appear to be strongly influenced by resource acquisition and much less by territorial defense. The groups showed very few encounters with neighboring groups, but when it did occur, the encounters were always aggressive, and included intensive bouts of long-calling,Ruiz-Miranda CR, Archer CA, Kleiman DG. (2002). Acoustic differences between spontaneous and induced long calls of golden lion tamarins, Leontopithecus rosalia. Folia Primatol 73:124-131. chases, and fights between the different groups. The golden-headed lion tamarin spends much of its time foraging and traveling within its home range to the next foraging site. Keep in mind that this study was completed at the biggest intact forest available to L. chrysomelas, so its behavior may change depending on the habitat and resources available. At a golden-headed lion tamarin site in Lemos Maia, it was shown that groups had an average home range of only 63 hectares,Rylands AB. (1989).

Chicago: University of Chicago Press. p 100-123. == Conservation == Adult at Chester Zoo The IUCN Red List categorized the golden-headed lion tamarin as endangered in 1982. According to Costa, Leite, Mendes, and Ditchfield, Brazil accounts for about 14% of the world's biota and has the largest mammal diversity in the world, with more than 530 described species.Costa LP, Leite YLR, Mendes SL, Ditchfield AD. (2004). Mammal Conservation in Brazil. Conservation Biology 19(3) 672-679. According to the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA), out of the 24 endemic primates of the Atlantic Forest, 15 of them are threatened. Brazil's Atlantic forest is one of the most endangered ecosystems on earth, in which the majority of the original forest has been cleared for farming, mining, ranching & expanding urban centers.Kleiman DG, Mallinson JC. (1998). Recovery and Management Committees for Lion Tamarins: Partnerships in Conservation Planning and Implementation. Society for Conservation Biology 12(1)27-38. The four species of lion tamarin have been studied and managed extensively, combining research on ecology, captive breeding, reintroduction and translocation, habitat restoration and protection, and environmental education. === Threats to survival === An individual roadkilled The forest of Bahia, Brazil has been reduced to 2% due to farming, ranching, mining and urbanization.Cawthon Lang KA. (2005 July 20). Primate Factsheets: Golden- headed lion tamarin (Leontopithecus chrysomelas) Taxonomy, Morphology, & Ecology. http://pin.primate.wisc.edu/factsheets/entry/golden- headed_lion_tamarin. The Atlantic Forest is highly fragmented, and the disappearance of this habitat is the main reason for the golden-headed lion tamarin's decline. The majority of the forest was once dominated by cocoa plants through a method known as cabruca. This is a system of shade cropping in which the middle and understory trees are removed and replaced with cocoa trees.Raboy BE, Christman MC, Dietz, JM. (2004). The use of Degraded and Shade Cocoa Forests by Endangered golden headed lion tamarins Leontopithecus chrysomelas. Oryx 38(1) 75-83. Although the tamarin's habitat is reduced, it still leaves old growth trees which give the tamarins a place to forage and to sleep. In 1989 farmers abandoned their cocoa plants due to a fungus that attacked their harvest. The old growth which was once available abundantly to the tamarins was destroyed to harvest timber, clear land for cattle or grow other crops. The Atlantic Forest is now a mosaic of primary and secondary forest, and agricultural lands.Stallings, JR & Robinson, JG. (1991). Disturbance, forest heterogeneity and primate communities in a Brazilian Atlantic Forest Park. A Primatologia no Brasil 3:357-368. === Conservation efforts === In 1980 the Brazilian government created the Una Biological Reserve for the protection of the golden-headed lion tamarin and its habitat. Over the years the park has been growing slowly as the government acquires more land. The population at Una is the largest population in the most intact forest. There is also a captive breeding colony of 25 golden-headed lion tamarins at the Rio de Janeiro Primate Center. Due to a great amount of help, scientist believe that there are around 6000 Golden-headed lion tamarin in the wild. In the early 1990s, the Landowner's Environmental Protection Plan was created to educate the community about the importance of protecting the forest and the tamarin. The protection plan included conservation activities on over 70% of the neighboring farms, educating farmers on how to use sustainable agriculture in order to preserve the tamarin's habitat. The plan also educates school children, hunters and forest guards on conservation, property rights and land use. This method of educating and involving the community has had great success for preserving the tamarin and their habitat. Kleiman and Mallinson summarize the conservation efforts that the IBAMA have made in order to help all four of the tamarin species with their population decline. Between 1985 and 1991 IBAMA established four International Recovery and Management Committees (IRMCs). These IRMCs provide IBAMA with official guidance in the recovery efforts and management of the four species, and they are recognized by the government of Brazil as technical advisors. Public concerns of the tamarin species occurred in the 1960s when Adelmar Coimbra-Filho brought to the attention the rapid declines of the golden lion tamarin due to exportation and habitat destruction. His input helped with the establishment of the biological reserves to protect lion tamarins. He founded the Rio de Janeiro Primate Center and he was the first person to breed the golden-headed lion tamarin. From 1983-1994 large numbers of golden headed lion tamarins were exported to Japan and Belgium as part of the exotic pet trade. IBAMA asked Jeremy Mallinson to form and become chair of an IRMC for the golden-headed lion tamarin. The initial objective of the committee was to have all of the tamarins returned to Brazil, and some of them were returned. The committees promotes lion tamarins as a flagship species with the ultimate intent being the preservation of the unique Atlantic Forest, ecosystem and its many endemic plants and animal. The IRMC is divided into several tasks which include the captive management and research program, conservation and education program in Bahia, a Landowner's Environmental Education Program, and a field study of ecology and behavior in the Federal Una Biological Reserve. They provide IBAMA with recommendations concerning demographic and genetic management, research proposals for wild and captive populations, community conservation education programs, expansion of protected areas through land acquisition, and they also lobby appropriate agencies to support new legislation. The IRMC members are international in composition with members from diverse disciplines, consisting of conservationists, field biologists, zoo biologists, educators, administrators, and IBAMA staff. == References == == External links == * ARKive - images and movies of the Golden-headed Lion Tamarin (Leontopithecus chrysomelas) * Golden-headed Lion Tamarin's range (Natureserve.org) golden- headed lion tamarin Category:Mammals of Brazil Category:Endemic fauna of Brazil golden-headed lion tamarin ","title":"Golden-headed lion tamarin"},{"id":"3237156","text":"The Columbus Post is a weekly newspaper devoted to the African-American audience of Columbus, Ohio.

Its limited geographical range makes it the rarest of the New World monkeys, with little known about it. It was thought to be extinct for 65 years until its rediscovery in 1970. In 2016 an adult couple was found to the east, in the Caetetus Ecological Station, after six years with no sightings. The total number of individuals is estimated to be around 1000. Some experts believe this to be an overestimate, as recent studies have shown that the average area inhabited by the black lion tamarin is closer to than the previously estimated . They are usually found in groups of 4 to 9, living in the secondary and primary forests along the circumference of its home range. On average, the black lion tamarin weighs . ==Diet== Black lion tamarin in Brazil. The diet of the black lion tamarin is seasonal and varies with the habitats it moves through. When the tamarin is in the dryland forest, it usually eats a variety of fruits, whereas in a swampy environment it predominantly feeds on the gum of various trees. In addition to seasonal variation, the black lion tamarin exhibits daily and monthly cycles of food preferences. Independent of the environment it occupies, a tamarin spends long periods each day searching for different types of insects and spiders to feed on. On average, 80% of its time foraging is spent searching for insects, such as by foraging the forest floor. The tamarin's foraging locations are very intentional: it spends extended periods of time looking under dry palm leaves, in loose bark, and in tree cavities, with hands that have specialized fingers for prying. The tamarin also positions itself in trees and scans for insects from above, usually four meters above the forest floor. The black lion tamarin eats the gum and fruit of trees, climbing up to ten meters to reach them and as these are easily found, the tamarin spends 12.8% of its day obtaining them, rather than the 41.2% of the day spent foraging for insects in the high trees. ==Offspring== Black lion tamarins mate and have offspring during the spring, summer, and fall months (August to March in Brazil). Females usually have one litter per year, though 20% females produce two litters per year. The mean litter size is two infants. Most mammals produce a 50:50 ratio of males to females. The black lion tamarin population almost always produce a 60:40 male to female ratio. Most infants deaths occur within the first two weeks of birth, with newborns of first-time mothers having the lowest survival rates. The number of tamarins that survive to adulthood in the wild is 10% higher than those in captivity. ===Food sharing=== During the first few months after birth, the infant is unable to obtain food on its own. For this reason, the infant rides on the parent's back and receives food from the parents. It drinks milk in the 4 to 5 weeks after birth; after that, the parents and other group-members share food with the infant. Sharing involves both offers from the parents and begging by the infant. Usually, until the age of approximately 15 weeks, the infant will receive the majority of its food (especially insects) from others. The number of offers from group-members peaks at week 7; after week 15, sharing slowly declines, stopping by week 26. ==Communication== Morro do Diabo State Park is the major conservation unit of the black lion tamarin. Within Leontopithecus, the black lion tamarin is the largest in size and has the lowest-pitched calls, using longer notes than other species. The black lion tamarin use calls to defend territory, maintain cohesion within the group, attract a mate, and contact individuals who might be lost. Most calls can be recorded in the morning, and can be attributed to the reunion of mated pairs. These mated pairs are coupled-up throughout the mating season. ===Taxonomy=== The classification of the black lion tamarin was debated, as one group of taxonomists classified the lion tamarins by their geography, while other taxonomists placed them all into one species and then divided them into subspecies. More recently, taxonomists have agreed to base classification predominantly on their geography, though sometimes characteristics such as long calls are used to classify different species, similar to the use of bird songs in taxonomy. For differentiating within Leontopithecus, the black lion tamarin is categorized as starting its call at the lowest note and going through the greatest range of pitch. ==Status and threats== Black lion tamarin conservation units in São Paulo State. Morro do Diabo State Park (yellow line) is the major forest remnant along black lion tamarin distribution. Mico Leão Preto Ecological Station (red line) fragments also hold groups. The black lion tamarin is the most endangered species within Leontopithecus, and the IUCN has recorded their population to be declining. The main threat against it is the destruction of its habitat through deforestation, though it is also threatened by being hunted in unprotected forests, such as the Fazenda Rio Claro and the Fazenda Tucano (which have roughly 3.66 and 1.0 individuals per square kilometer respectively). There have been several attempts to bring black lion tamarins into captivity and to salvage what little habitat they have left within the Morro do Diabo State Park, as well as to increase breeding rates. Their population decline in the wild, however, could cause the black lion tamarins to become entirely endemic to the Morro do Diabo. ==Gallery== == References == == External links == * Geographic range of the black lion tamarin black lion tamarin Category:Mammals of Brazil Category:Endemic fauna of Brazil black lion tamarin ","title":"Black lion tamarin"},{"id":"3237168","text":"Werner Drechsler (January 17, 1923 in Mühlberg, Germany – March 12, 1944 in Papago Park, Arizona) was a German U-boat crewman during World War II. He served on , which was sunk off the Azores in 1943. When he was taken prisoner he enthusiastically cooperated with his captors, probably because his father had spent time in one of Adolf Hitler's Concentration Camps as a political prisoner. Eventually, United States Navy intelligence officers recruited Drechsler as a spy and placed him in a prisoner of war (POW) camp near Fort Meade, Maryland with other U-Boat sailors. After arrival, Drechsler worked undercover, befriending his fellow POWs in order to collect information regarding German submarine technology, operational procedures and tactics and any other intelligence which could be useful to the allies. On March 12, 1944 Drechsler was transferred to a different POW camp in Arizona which was filled mainly with other submariners of the Kriegsmarine. This transfer took place even though Drechsler was supposed to be kept segregated from other naval prisoners, particularly his former crewmates on the U-118, who were aware of Drechsler's spying activities. Drechsler's transfer to Arizona quickly had fatal results: some members of the U-118 were confined at the camp and they immediately recognised their former crewmate. Word of Drechsler's undercover activities spread rapidly through the camp, and a kangaroo court was convened while Drechsler was asleep. The other prisoners eventually decided that it was necessary to kill Drechsler to ensure he could no longer spy upon them, and also to act as a deterrent for any other POWs who might consider collaborating with the enemy. The next morning Drechsler was found hanging in the shower room. Seven men (Helmut Fischer, Fritz Franke, Günter Külsen, Heinrich Ludwig, Bernhard Reyak, Otto Stengel and Rolf Wizny) were tried by a general court- martial and executed for the beating and hanging of Drechsler. In the last mass execution in the United States, the men were hanged on August 25, 1945 at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. == See also == *Prisoner of war *Prisoner-of-war camp == References == * Richard Whittingham, Martial Justice: The Last Mass Execution in the United States, Naval Institute Press, 1997 == External links == * A community college historical website which explains the Werner Drechsler story in detail * website which follows history channel program about the mass execution * A number of photographs taken around the time of Drechsler's capture Category:1923 births Category:1944 deaths Category:Kriegsmarine personnel Category:Murdered military personnel Category:Submariners Category:German prisoners of war in World War II held by the United States Category:German people who died in prison custody Category:Prisoners who died in United States military detention Category:Prisoners murdered in custody Category:German people murdered abroad ","title":"Werner Drechsler"},{"id":"3237169","text":"Jagdish Singh (Jag) Bhaduria (also variously spelled Badauria or Bhadauria) (born January 23, 1940) is a Canadian former politician. Bhaduria was born in New Delhi, India. After an unsuccessful attempt to win election to the House of Commons of Canada in Markham riding in the 1988 election, Bhaduria was elected in the 1993 federal election as the Liberal Member of Parliament for Markham—Whitchurch—Stouffville. In 1993, Bhaduia won the Liberal nomination under very controversial circumstances. It was later discovered that he got people to vote for him who were proven to be ineligible to vote, people listed at addresses that were unknown, people who were listed as party members but did not know they were, and members who had not paid membership fees. He was expelled from the Liberal caucus in early 1994, after concerns that he had embellished his resume attracted considerable adverse publicity. In seeking the Liberal nomination, he had claimed an \\"LL.B. (Int.)\\" Many were under the impression that this was a claim to a Bachelor of Laws in international law. Bhaduria, in fact, possessed no bachelor of law degree, and argued that the Int. referred to the intermediate examinations he had taken towards an unfinished LL.B. from the University of London. Bhaduria had already come under fire weeks earlier when it was revealed that, in 1990, he had been fired from his position as a teacher with the Toronto Board of Education for writing threatening letters to school administrators. From February 17–20, 2003 and on March 5, 2003 a public hearing was conducted by the Ontario College of Teachers Discipline Committee into allegations of professional misconduct against Bhadauria by issuing documents that he knew or ought to have known contained false, improper or misleading statements. The panel found Bhadauria guilty of professional misconduct and ordered his Certificates of Qualification and Registration suspended for a period of 18 months, including eight months already served when the board suspended him. The panel also ordered Bhadauria reprimanded and stated that if Bhadauria presented himself to be reprimanded by the committee, the remainder of the penalty would be suspended. Bhadauria did not attend the session scheduled for the reprimand and the remainder of the suspension will be served. In the wake of the scandals, over 35,000 of Bhaduria's constituents signed a petition demanding his recall. However, as no process exists to recall Members of Parliament, Bhaduria was able to remain in Parliament until the 1997 federal election when he ran as an independent candidate and was defeated. ==Electoral history== } } == References == ==External links== * Category:1940 births Category:Living people Category:Liberal Party of Canada MPs Category:Independent MPs in the Canadian House of Commons Category:Members of the House of Commons of Canada from Ontario Category:Indian emigrants to Canada Category:Canadian politicians of Indian descent ","title":"Jag Bhaduria"},{"id":"3237171","text":"is a Japanese children's animated television program that follows the adventures of a young Felix the Cat and infant versions of the characters from Joe Oriolo's Felix television program from the 1950s.

Odum and colleagues in the 1950s during studies of the tropical forests funded by the United States Atomic Energy Commission. They are used to compose energy flow diagrams in the field of systems ecology. ==Design intent== The design intent of the energy systems language was to facilitate the generic depiction of energy flows through any scale system while encompassing the laws of physics, and in particular, the laws of thermodynamics (see energy transformation for an example). In particular H.T. Odum aimed to produce a language which could facilitate the intellectual analysis, engineering synthesis and management of global systems such as the geobiosphere, and its many subsystems. Within this aim, H.T. Odum had a strong concern that many abstract mathematical models of such systems were not thermodynamically valid. Hence he used analog computers to make system models due to their intrinsic value; that is, the electronic circuits are of value for modelling natural systems which are assumed to obey the laws of energy flow, because, in themselves the circuits, like natural systems, also obey the known laws of energy flow, where the energy form is electrical. However Odum was interested not only in the electronic circuits themselves, but also in how they might be used as formal analogies for modeling other systems which also had energy flowing through them. As a result, Odum did not restrict his inquiry to the analysis and synthesis of any one system in isolation. The discipline that is most often associated with this kind of approach, together with the use of the energy systems language is known as systems ecology. ==General characteristics== Passive electrical equivalent of Energy Systems Language storage icon When applying the electronic circuits (and schematics) to modeling ecological and economic systems, Odum believed that generic categories, or characteristic modules, could be derived. Moreover he felt that a general symbolic system, fully defined in electronic terms (including the mathematics thereof) would be useful for depicting real system characteristics, such as the general categories of production, storage, flow, transformation, and consumption. Central principles of electronics also therefore became central features of the energy systems language – Odum's generic symbolism. Depicted to the left is what the generic symbol for storage, which Odum named the Bertalanffy module, in honor of the general systems theorist Ludwig von Bertalanffy. For Odum, in order to achieve a holistic understanding of how many apparently different systems actually affect each other, it was important to have a generic language with a massively scalable modeling capacity – to model global-to-local, ecological, physical and economic systems. The intention was, and for those who still apply it, is, to make biological, physical, ecological, economic and other system models thermodynamically, and so also energetically, valid and verifiable. As a consequence the designers of the language also aimed to include the energy metabolism of any system within the scope of inquiry. ==Pictographic icons== In order to aid learning, in Modeling for all Scales Odum and Odum (2000) suggested systems might first be introduced with pictographic icons, and then later defined in the generic symbolism. Pictograms have therefore been used in software programs like ExtendSim to depict the basic categories of the Energy Systems Language. Some have argued that such an approach shares similar motivations to Otto Neurath's isotype project, Leibniz's (Characteristica Universalis) Enlightenment Project and Buckminster Fuller's works. ==See also== * Characteristica universalis * Embodied energy * Emergy * Principles of energetics * SysML * Unified Modelling Language * Universal language ==References== * M.T.Brown (2004) 'A picture is worth a thousand words: energy systems language and simulation', Ecological Modelling, 178: 83–100. * H.T.

The book title refers to some of the professional players involved in this series. The Professor is mathematical poker mind Howard Lederer, the Banker is Andrew Beal himself, and the Suicide King is crazy, sometimes reckless player Ted Forrest. It also refers to the King of Hearts, since on the card the King's sword appears to be put in his head. ==Plot summary== The highest stakes poker match of all time was played over the course of a few years, between Andrew Beal and a group of professional poker players called \\"The Corporation.\\" The group included Ted Forrest, Jennifer Harman, Minh Ly, Doyle Brunson, Todd Brunson, Howard Lederer, David Grey, Chip Reese, Gus Hansen, Phil Ivey, Barry Greenstein, Lyle Berman and others. Many of them kept their identities anonymous, or were part of the group at different points. Ted Forrest, a professional poker player, was driving outside of Las Vegas when he called the Bellagio poker room. The personnel in the poker room informed him the highest game is $10,000-$20,000. He went to the poker room and sat down with his last $500,000. He played against Chip Reese and Andy Beal. Forrest had lost $400,000 without playing a single hand, and questioned why he was there. Back in February 2001, Beal first visited the Bellagio poker room. He enjoyed the atmosphere and met professional poker players, like Todd Brunson. He ended up winning over $100,000 crediting it to luck. Beal decided to study the game and face top players. Andy returned to Las Vegas and played heads-up with professionals for the highest stakes. Top professional poker players decided to pool their money with everybody who they thought could play the game against Beal. Beal began his match with Chip Reese, then Ted Forrest sat down. Down to his last $100,000 Forrest makes a comeback and wins $1.5 million. He is then asked to join the group and nobody else sits down besides Beal and his selected opponent, who alternates. The matches continued for three years with the amateur multi-millionaire Andy Beal surprisingly winning most of the contests and eventually flying back to Texas with over $10 million of The Corporation's money. Late in the series, The Corporation was forced to have all of its members add money to the collective bankroll in order to continue the match. In March 2004, Beal announced he was finished with poker for good after losing $16 million in two days, primarily to The Corporation's young star Phil Ivey. ==Post 2004== For two years Beal keeps his vow to quit poker, but returns to high-stakes poker in 2006.

They weigh between 365 and 1135 grams and measure, from the head to the base of the tail, between 225 and 370mm. Black-capped squirrel monkeys are primarily tree-dwelling and are found in both native and plantation forests as well as some farmed areas near running water. Their diet is omnivorous and mostly consists of flowers, fruit, leaves, nuts, seeds, insects, arachnids, eggs and small vertebrates. They mostly live in female- dominated troops of around 40 to 75 monkeys, with males having been observed to disperse to live in all-male troops after reaching sexual maturation. Their current conservation status according to the IUCN is 'Least Concern'. The species belongs to the genus Saimiri and has two subspecies, S. b. boliviensis (the Bolivian squirrel monkey) and S. b. peruviensis (the Peruvian squirrel monkey). ==Description== The black-capped squirrel monkey exhibits the rounded 'Roman type' white arch pattern over the eyes. The black-capped squirrel monkey displays sexual dimorphism, with males normally weighing between 550 and 1135 grams and females weighing between 365 and 750 grams. Infants typically weigh between 80 and 140 grams when they are born. Adults of the species measure in length (from the head to the base of the tail) between 250 and 370mm for males and 225 and 295mm for females. The coat of the monkey is short, soft and dense, and the majority of the fur covering the back of the monkey is a grey to olive-brown hue, while the undersides are typically white, yellow or ochre. The head is characteristically black with white arches over the eyes. The tail is the same colour as the body with a black tufted tip and is not prehensile; it usually measures around 350 to 425mm. Physically, the black-capped squirrel monkey is very similar to a number of other species of squirrel monkey, but is distinguishable from other species by a number of features. The most noticeable of these are the dark black cap and the white ‘Roman type’ arch pattern over the monkey’s eyes, which is more narrow and rounded than the ‘Gothic type’ arch pattern over the eyes of the other species. The tail of the ‘Roman type’ species is also narrower than that of the ‘Gothic type’. ==Evolution== Saimiri boliviensis is thought to have diverged from the Saimiri genus approximately 1.5 million years ago. It has been hypothesised that this diversification occurred due to environmental changes in the Pleistocene period which allowed for thicker vegetation to appear in the Amazonian rainforest. ===Fossils=== Several different fossils have been linked to the genus Saimiri through examinations of their dental and cranial morphology, including the Early Miocene fossil Dolichocebus which was discovered in Gaiman, Argentina and dated to around 20.5 million years ago, and the Middle Miocene fossil of the genus Neosaimiri discovered in La Venta, Colombia, which has been dated to between 12.1 and 12.5 million years ago. ===Taxonomic classification=== Originally all squirrel monkeys were considered to be of the same species; they were first divided into two different ‘types’ - ‘Roman’ and ‘Gothic’ - in Paul D. Maclean’s article ‘Mirror Display in the Squirrel Monkey, Saimiri sciureus’, published in 1964. Many different opinions on the taxonomic classification of Saimiri boliviensis as a separate species have been published, however various studies conducted by several researchers have concluded that Saimiri boliviensis is one of at most seven different species of Saimiri. Based on the geographical distribution and the morphological and behavioural characteristics of the specimens studied, Hershkovitz proposed the existence of Saimiri boliviensis as a distinct species with two sub-species, Saimiri boliviensis boliviensis and Saimiri boliviensis peruviensis. Based on cranial measurements and coat colouring, Thorington proposed Saimiri sciureus boliviensis as a sub-species of Saimiri sciureus. Another prominent report published in 1993 supports Thorington's classification, however after further investigation into the genetic characteristics of the monkey a more recently published report concludes that Hershkovitz's description is the most accurate. The dispute over the taxonomic and genetic classification of the black-capped squirrel monkey has become increasingly relevant with regards to their use in biomedical research, due to the fact that hybridisation may have an effect on the reproductive capabilities of the monkey, and has the potential to cause a differentiation in its susceptibility to certain pathogens and infections. Alternative or previously proposed taxonomic names include: * Saimiri sciureus boliviensis * Callithrix boliviensis (monkeys from Bolivia) * Callithrix entomophagus (monkeys from Tefé, Brazil) * Saimiri boliviensis nigriceps (monkeys from Cosnipata, Peru) * Saimiri boliviensis pluvialis (monkeys from the Rio Jurua in Brazil) ==Distribution and habitat== The black-capped squirrel monkey is typically arboreal. Saimiri displaying the characteristic ‘Roman arch’ facial pattern of the black-capped squirrel monkey have been documented throughout most of Bolivia, northern Peru, and between the Jurua and Purus Rivers in Brazil. They are found in lowland tropical rainforests near water in densely forested and swampy regions. They are predominantly arboreal, and while they utilise all levels of the forests they have been observed to keep mostly to the lower canopies for the purposes of travel and foraging It has been proposed that matrilineal troops of Saimiri boliviensis are formed due to an abundance of fruit and insects present in their habitat, which is not present in the habitats of other species of the Saimiri genus. ==Biology== Saimiri boliviensis are mostly arboreal but will occasionally also be found on the forest floor. They are diurnal and have been observed to be most active during the early to mid-morning, before resting for one or two hours in the afternoon, followed by another period of activity from the early afternoon to evening. ===Social systems=== The black-capped squirrel monkey is found in female dominated troops of around 45 to 75 monkeys, unlike its relative the Common squirrel monkey which habitually lives in male dominated troops of around 15 to 50. In contrast to most other species of monkeys, female Saimiri boliviensis will remain in the troop into which they are born, while males are more likely to be excluded by more dominant females. When they reach sexual maturity, male Black-capped squirrel monkeys will disperse from their natal troop into smaller male-dominated groups, and will eventually join a larger troop of both genders with the same male group. Black-capped squirrel monkey troops display high levels of aggression between females. Female monkeys will often compete with other female members of the troop to determine access to resources, however it has been observed that despite heavy competition for food they still prefer to live in large groups in order to reduce the likelihood of predation. ===Reproduction=== A family of Saimiri boliviensis A Black-capped squirrel monkey will typically reach sexual maturation at around 3 years of age for females and 5 years of age for males. The yearly reproductive cycle of mature Saimiri has been observed by several researchers to be affected by a number of environmental factors, including the cycles of rainfall and levels of illumination in their habitat. The mating season coincides with the dry season, and will typically result in a single infant being born to each mother. It has been suggested that adult female monkeys are more receptive to environmental cues for the mating season to begin, and the response in males is in part attributed to behavioural and scent cues from the females. During the mating season, males of the species will gain a large amount of subcutaneous upper body fat, leading to what is known as a ‘fatted’ appearance. It has also been observed that the testosterone levels of monkeys of the Bolivian and Peruvian species are noticeably higher during the mating season than those of other species of male Saimiri from Guayana. Males will become more irritable and aggressive, fight more frequently for the purpose of achieving dominance within the troop, and engage in genital display towards less dominant males. It has been observed in both natural and laboratory settings that the hierarchy of the troop may change up to as often as three times in a month, and this will often result in highly aggressive fights which may lead to the complete exclusion of younger adult males from the troop. The scent and behavioural cues of a female monkey assist a male in his judgement of whether or not she will be receptive to his approach and attempt at mating with her. If she is not receptive, the female, sometimes with the aid of other nearby females, will usually chase the male away. Consorting and copulation between a male and female monkey may last between one minute and over an hour depending on the presence of other monkeys and the environment in which it takes place. The gestation period of the monkey has been estimated to last between 160 and 170 days. During the first week following its birth, an infant monkey will cling to its mother’s back and will seldom move or be attended to by the mother unless it is in some way in need of assistance. ===Communication=== Squirrel monkeys have been found to be some of the most vocal primates, with a large range of different types of calls documented throughout their lifespan. Commonly used sounds include ‘chucks’, a variety of purrs and squawks elicited during the birthing and mating seasons, chirps and peeps used for alarm or attention, as well as aggressive screaming and ‘barking’. Infant Black-capped squirrel monkeys tend to vocally communicate much more than adults. The most common form of infant communication is a number of different ‘peeps’, which begin to occur most frequently at around 2 months of age when the infant starts to spend more time away from its mother. After maturation, the most commonly used call for adult females is a variety of ‘chucks’, used to maintain contact in dense vegetation where visual identification is not possible. ===Food and foraging=== Black-capped squirrel monkeys are omnivorous. A typical squirrel monkey diet includes fruits, insects, eggs, small vertebrates, arachnids, leaves, flowers, nuts, and seeds; however it has been observed that they prefer insects to fruit. Mature Saimiri spend most of the day foraging. They will begin foraging at around 60 to 40 minutes before sunrise and will spend the first part of the day actively feeding on fruits and any insects they are able to hunt while foraging for fruit. They will then adopt more sedate feeding behaviours and spend the rest of the day resting and hunting for more insects. Often, when food is not scarce, they will stop and rest for an hour or two in the middle of the day when it is too hot to continue. ===Locomotion=== Black-capped squirrel monkeys are mostly found in trees and will often leap 1–2 metres between branches. They are capable of moving swiftly through dense vegetation at a four-legged walk or run with diagonal sequence footfalls (wherein the hind leg on one side will touch down followed by the foreleg of the opposite side). They will occasionally adopt a stationary bipedal stance at ground level while foraging. The monkey’s tail is usually used for balance, or by infants to secure them to their mother’s tail or abdomen. ==Conservation status== The black-capped squirrel monkey population has been listed as being of ‘Least Concern’ by the IUCN, despite population numbers being in a general state of decline. It has been determined that the black-capped squirrel monkey is adapts easily to changes or potential threats to its environment, and is not subject to high levels of hunting by humans. According to the IUCN, the main threats to the habitat of the monkey are agricultural and aquacultural uses of their habitat, and the use of the monkey's biological resources for purposes such as hunting, trapping, logging and wood harvesting. ==References== ==External links== *Saimiri boliviensis boliviensis genome in Ensembl * Category:Squirrel monkeys Category:Primates of South America Category:Mammals described in 1834 Category:Articles containing video clips ","title":"Black-capped squirrel monkey"},{"id":"3237205","text":"Aoraki was a New Zealand parliamentary electorate that existed for four parliamentary terms from 1996 to 2008. It was held by Jim Sutton of the Labour Party for three terms, and the remaining term by Jo Goodhew of the National Party. It was located in the South Island, covering southern Canterbury and northern Otago. It was named after the mountain Aoraki / Mount Cook. ==Population centres== The 1996 election was notable for the significant change of electorate boundaries, based on the provisions of the Electoral Act 1993. Because of the introduction of the mixed-member proportional (MMP) electoral system, the number of electorates had to be reduced, leading to significant changes. More than half of the electorates contested in 1996 were newly constituted, and most of the remainder had seen significant boundary changes. In total, 73 electorates were abolished, 29 electorates were newly created (including Aoraki), and 10 electorates were recreated, giving a net loss of 34 electorates. ==History== The electorate of Aoraki was created for the 1996 election, as part of the major redistribution in the transition to MMP. It was effectively a merger of the old seats of Timaru and Waitaki, bringing the town of Timaru and its surrounding farmland together in one electorate. The boundaries of Aoraki did not undergo any significant changes since the seat was created. However, in boundary changes for the 2008 general election, Aoraki ceased to exist, with the bulk of its population centres being transferred to a resurrected electorate named Rangitata.

Bray (October 23, 1917 – March 7, 1983) was an American film and television actor probably best remembered for his role as the forest ranger Corey Stuart in the CBS series Lassie. He also starred in Stagecoach West. ==Life and career== Bray was born to homesteading parents in Kalispell, Montana. The family moved to Seattle, Washington, where Bray attended Lincoln High School. After graduation, he was for a time a lumberjack, a cowboy, and a member of the Civilian Conservation Corps. In 1942, Bray joined the United States Marine Corps and saw action in the South Pacific during World War II. He finished the war at the rank of master sergeant and then aspired to become a taxidermist or the owner of a hunting/fishing lodge. Instead, Bray entered films in 1946 under contract to RKO. He was marketed as the \\"next Gary Cooper\\" but appeared in B Westerns like 1949's Rustlers. In the 1950s, the then freelancing actor appeared in a varied number of roles including the 1952 episode \\"Thunder Over Inyo\\" of the syndicated western television series The Adventures of Kit Carson. In 1954, he portrayed bandit Emmett Dalton in an episode of Jim Davis's syndicated western Stories of the Century. That same year, he guest-starred in Reed Hadley's CBS crime drama, The Public Defender. On December 4, 1955, he was cast as petroleum pioneer Pattillo Higgins in \\"Spindletop – The First Great Texas Oil Strike (January 10, 1901)\\" on the CBS history series, You Are There, the story of the origin of the Texas oil industry. In 1958, he starred in Never Love a Stranger, a film adaptation of a Harold Robbins novel. Bray guest-starred in the episode \\"Obituary\\" of NBC's western series, Jefferson Drum, starring Jeff Richards, and in the 1959 episode \\"The Trouble with Tolliver\\" of the ABC western drama, The Man from Blackhawk. He appeared twice on ABC's The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp. Bray was cast as Carl the Bus Driver in Bus Stop with Marilyn Monroe (1956) and as detective Mike Hammer in My Gun Is Quick (1957). Other roles were on NBC's western anthology series, Frontier and on the syndicated series City Detective and State Trooper. Early in 1960, Bray was cast as Tom Byson in the episode \\"Three Graves\\" of the NBC western series, Riverboat. In the 1960–1961 television season, Bray played Simon Kane in the ABC series Stagecoach West (TV series).Stagecoach West. The Western comprised 38 one-hour episodes. He starred in three episodes of NBC's western Laramie between 1960 and 1963. He appeared in three episodes of CBS's Perry Mason. In 1959 he played pivate detective and murder victim Carl Davis in \\"The Case of the Foot-Loose Doll.\\" In the 1962 episode, \\"The Case of the Angry Astronaut,\\" he had the role of title character and defendant Mitch Heller; and in 1963 he portrayed wealthy murder victim Martin Walden (Episode 180, \\"The Case of the Potted Planter\\"). He also guest-starred in NBC's Temple Houston (TV series), Overland Trail, and The Loretta Young Show. He appeared in four episodes of CBS's anthology suspense series Alfred Hitchcock Presents between 1958 and 1961. In 1958, Bray was offered a supporting role in director Joshua Logan's film adaptation of South Pacific, but he decided instead to star in low-budget films for Allied Artists. It was a strategic error in his career, for South Pacific became a smash success. In 1964, Bray won the role of USFS Ranger Corey Stuart in Season 11 of Lassie because of his affinity for animals and their reciprocity toward him. The relationship continued for two more seasons. He was written out of the series as a victim of a forest fire, and his character was sent away to a hospital never to return.Lassie Star Bray and his wife, Joan, retired to Bishop, California, in the Sierra Nevada. He was often seen in his Winnebago in Bishop with his dog \\"Lady\\". Bray was a fly fisherman, hunter, model duck carver, and all-around sportsman. ==Death== He spent his last years in the High Sierras where he had made many of his early western films. Bray died of a heart attack. His ashes were scattered over Zuma Beach in Malibu, California. ==Selected filmography== * Sunset Pass (1946) – Bank Clerk (uncredited) * Crack Up (1946) – Man with Drunk (uncredited) * Dick Tracy vs. Cueball (1946) – Steve (uncredited) * Vacation in Reno (1946) – Police Guard in Bank (uncredited) * The Falcon's Adventure (1946) – Doorman (uncredited) * San Quentin (1946) – Saunders, a Gunman (uncredited) * Banjo (1947) – Policeman (uncredited) * Honeymoon (1947) – Bridegroom (uncredited) * Desperate (1947) – Policeman with Lt.

Entrance by sea to Road Harbour is straightforward although many boats continue to run aground on the sand bar on the Road Reef/Fort Burt side of the harbour at the entrance.

This species is located the Brazilian states of Pará and Maranhão along the Atlantic coast to the north of the country, and usually found in dense forest regions, where their food is more abundant, but can also be found in secondary growth areas during the dry season. Like most Capuchins, the Kaapori capuchin is diurnal, arboreal and omnivorous, their diet consisting of small animals and plants. They eat roughly equal portions of plants and animals, mainly feeding on ripe fruits and small insects and invertebrates such as spiders, snails, wasps, caterpillars, grasshoppers, ants, and bird eggs. It weighs about 2 – 3 kg. The Kaapori capuchin is polygamous, and females usually give birth to one infant per birth, with twins being rare. Births usually occur every 2 years, but they may occur closer together if a baby dies, with a gestation period of 150 – 180 days. Formerly considered a subspecies of the wedge-capped capuchin (Cebus olivaceus), it was recently elevated to species status. ==References== Kaapori capuchin Category:Mammals of Brazil Category:Endemic fauna of Brazil Category:Environment of Maranhão Category:Environment of Pará Category:Critically endangered animals Category:Critically endangered biota of South America Kaapori capuchin Category:Primates of South America ","title":"Kaapori capuchin"},{"id":"3237228","text":"Bareboating is the act of chartering a sailboat that one lives upon, navigates, and operates for a vacation. Common bareboating locations are the Caribbean, Mediterranean and the Whitsundays . To charter a sailboat, one must usually be able to demonstrate boat handling skills especially in operating the boat under power, docking, and anchoring. Typical sizes for bareboats come in the range of 30 ft to usually about 60 ft at the upper end. Most charter operators require a sailing resume listing sailing experience, boats that one has sailed and operated, and navigation and racing experience. If the charter operator is not satisfied that one has the appropriate experience, they will often require that the chartering party hire a captain from the charter company to sail with them for a few days. In most traditional charter destinations such as Greece or Croatia the chartering company would ask to see a skippers recognised yachting certificate in order to charter bareboat yachts. While it is always possible to add extra services to a bareboat rented vessel, it remains fundamental to understand that the term bareboat indicates that the vessel is being offered bare of crew, food and special equipment.

It is found in northern Brazil, Guyana, French Guiana, Suriname, Venezuela and possibly northern Colombia. The genus Cebus is divided into several different species. However, taxonomists argue over the specific divisions within the genus, which are uncertain and controversial. Cebus olivaceus is known to dwell in tall, primary forest and travel over long distances during the day.Fragaszy, Dorothy M., Elisabetta Visalberghi, and Linda Marie. Fedigan. The Complete Capuchin: The Biology of the Genus Cebus. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 2004. Print These primates are medium-sized monkeys with distinctive \\"wedge cap\\" markings on their head and slightly longer limbs than other capuchins for jumping through the forest canopy. Similar to other capuchin monkeys, the diet of wedge-capped capuchin primarily consists of fruits, invertebrates, other plant parts, and on rare occasions small vertebrates. They have also been known to rub millipedes against their fur, especially in the rainy seasons, as a potential means of mosquito repellent. Although this species is classified as an animal of least concern by IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, it falls prey to many predators in South America ranging from vultures to jaguars. Cebus olivaceus is a polygamous species that lives in groups anywhere from 5-30 individuals, with a female biased sex ratios. The group is organized according to a pre-determined hierarchal system of dominance for both males and females. Although biological lineage is less of a factor of dominance for males than it is for females, due to male migration between groups. Wedge-capped capuchin partake in several behavioral mechanisms to assert and maintain dominance within the group including: infanticide, when an infant is deliberately killed; grooming, used to facilitate social rapport; and alloparenting, which is when members of the group care for offspring that are not their own. == Description == ===Size and physical description=== Adult wedge-capped capuchins weight approximately 3 kg, but weight varies moderately with sex. They receive their name from a black triangle of dark fur centered on their foreheads. Generally this species is light brown to brown with yellow and gray tinges on varying parts of their bodies. Their “wedge cap” starts between the eyes and extends backwards to cover the top of the head. Their faces are hairless and surrounded by light brown or blonde fur. Wedge-capped capuchins show similar levels of sexual dimorphism as other capuchin monkeys. On average, males weigh about 30% more than females. Additionally, males have relatively longer canines than females (even after overall body size is accounted for). Male maxillary and mandibular (upper and lower) canines of males are on average 70% and 40% larger than female canines respectively. This may be indicative of male competition for females. === Locomotion and morphology === Wedge-capped capuchins have been compared to tufted capuchins to discern the relationship between locomotion and skeletal proportions. Wedge-capped capuchins spent relatively more time running and jumping through the forest canopy while tufted capuchins spent more time walking and moving slowly. As such, wedge-capped capuchins have relatively longer limbs (particularly the hind limbs) than tufted capuchins. == Phylogeny == Due to large physical variations in Cebus, taxonomists have frequently debated the exact classifications and details of the genus. However, most agree that the wedge-capped capuchin shares the genus with four others: C. apella, C. albifrons, C. capucinus, and C. kaapori. The wedge- capped capuchin has a diploid chromosome number of 52, though some others in the genus have 54 chromosomes. Nine human chromosomes correspond to those of the C. olivaceus. Phylogenetic analysis and constructions of cladograms have demonstrated that the wedge-capped capuchin is closely related to C. apella. == Habitat and range == Wedge-capped capuchins prefer undisturbed primary forests in which they can move through the canopy (locomotion and limb morphology). They occupy the rainforests of northern Brazil and Venezuela, as well as the drier forests along riverbeds in Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana. These habitats vary in terms of forest height, composition, and continuity. When wedge-capped capuchins have the option between dense high- canopy primary forests and more fragmented, lower forests, they generally inhabit the primary forests. == Diet == Wedge-capped capuchins are omnivorous and eat both animal and plant foods. Foraging behavior varies seasonally, as well as with age and sex. In general, these monkeys spend approximately equal amounts of time exploiting animal and plant resources. The exception to this are infants that spend far more time foraging for plants foods than animals. Most of the plant food consumed is ripe fruit, the majority of which are figs. Their animal prey is almost exclusively invertebrates. Their prey consists of snails, wasps, caterpillars, grasshoppers, ants, birds eggs and many insects that inhabit palm crowns. While males and females spend about the same amount of time foraging for insects, they exploit different types of resources. Males spend more time searching for insects on the surface of branches, while females search for most of their insects atop palm trees. There is little variation in plant material consumed between males and females. Also, adults and sub-adults eat more animal material than juveniles and infants. ===Food washing=== Food washing has been observed in non-human primates including macaques and capuchins. The primates will sometimes wash their sandy fruits and foods prior to eating them. This act has been described as an example of protoculture. Wedge-capped capuchins were shown to wash sandy food in four spontaneous occasions in both captive and wild populations. Urbani found that food washing was a response to certain circumstantial problems and not through imitation or learning, as argued in studies of other species. == Behavior == Wedge-capped capuchins live in groups ranging from as few as 5 individuals to more than 30 individuals. The groups generally consist of one reproductively active adult male, several adult females and their offspring, and, in some cases, non-reproductive adult males. Juveniles generally make up about 50% of a groups population. The population structure is heavily skewed toward females. There are approximately 2 females to every male at birth. This ratio increases to more than 4 adult females for every adult male. This is the result of both female-biased birth ratios and male migration behavior. A wedge-capped capuchin in São Paulo Zoo. Birthrate in wedge-capped capuchins varies with age. Younger and middle-aged females (6 to 26 years old) give birth as often as once every two years. Older females (older than 26 years) may only give birth once every three or four years. It is important to note that both male and female wedge-capped capuchins live as long as 36 years. In wedge-capped capuchins, males emigrate from their natal groups while females generally remain in the same group for the majority of their lives. Males generally leave their natal group between 3 and 6 years of age. Young males spend little time alone after leaving their natal groups and quickly integrate into a new group. Males prefer to join groups with a high ratio of females to adult males, as this maximizes their probability for future mating success. Immigrating males generally meet little opposition when joining a new group. Older females may migrate to new groups on rare occasions. ===Infanticide=== Infanticide, or the deliberate killing of an infant, in any non-human primate is of considerable interest to ecologists because it can affect the particular primate's reproductive success and ultimately lead to great demographic changes within the primate's troop. Infanticide has been observed in C. olivaceus. Genetically, it may pay for a male wedge-capped capuchin to kill an unrelated newborn, so that he can then mate with the mother sooner than if the baby was still alive. This allows the male to propagate his genes faster through the troop. However, in Valderrama's research, the infanticidal male gained reproductive success from the killing in only one of the three cases studied. High-ranking females' infants were targeted in all three cases. The variability surrounding the infanticide among the three cases studied is characteristic surrounding infanticide among any other non-human primates. === Dominance hierarchy === Both male and female wedge-capped capuchins have a dominance hierarchy. Female status is often established based on matrilines, with dominant mothers tending to have dominant daughters. Male dominance is not as easily passed from one generation to the next due to male migration. This dominance hierarchy is particularly helpful in explaining female- initiated agonistic behavior. Females higher in the hierarchy tend to be more aggressive toward both females and males that are lower on their respective dominance hierarchies. Aggressive behavior includes lunging, vocalization, and chasing. Sometimes many females chase males together. Male aggression was not correlated with position in the dominance hierarchy. Male aggression toward females is generally limited to vocalizations, lunging, and chasing. On one occasion, however, an adult male was observed to attack and kill a young adult female from the same group. This level of aggression is not the norm, usually being practiced in the animal kingdom as a method of takeover. === Grooming === Grooming behavior plays an important role in the group dynamics of wedge- capped capuchins. Grooming may be a way for both sub-adult males and females to integrate themselves into the adult social structure. This has been particularly well-documented in female-female interactions. Sub-adult females rarely groom each other, but rather focus their attention on grooming older females. These young females, who stay in their natal groups, must develop relationships with adult females to assimilate into the adult female social structure. In these instances, young females often seek out grooming opportunities with adult females. The adult females who are the recipients of this behavior are generally less enthusiastic about the interaction than their younger counterparts. This may indicate that adult females gain little benefit from these grooming interactions compared with sub-adult females. Sub-adult females may support their older companions in aggressive interactions. Young females that fail to establish relationships with older females become peripheral to the group and lose access to resources. Grooming behavior among adult females has a different pattern. Contrary to the normal pattern in primates, females often groom individuals who are lower in rank than they are. This may be largely due to the presence of two different grooming strategies among adult female wedge-capped capuchins. One of these strategies is referred to as appeasement. Subordinate females, when approached by dominant females, will lie down and solicit grooming. This has been interpreted as a way to avoid aggressive behavior from the dominant female. Interactions where a dominant female approaches a subordinate one often end in aggressive behavior, and soliciting grooming is a way to diffuse that aggression. This form of grooming is usually not reciprocated by the subordinate female. The other form of grooming behavior among adult females is affiliative. In contrast to grooming as appeasement, affiliative grooming is dependent on reciprocation. These interactions usually occur between individuals that hold high or intermediate positions in the dominance hierarchy. This form of grooming helps establish alliances between females that may provide both social and material advantages. === Alloparenting === Allomaternal care is when an individual other than an infant’s mother helps care for it, is common in wedge-capped capuchins. There are several behaviors associated with allomaternal care in these monkeys, including nursing and carrying the infant. For the first three months after birth, infants are cared for exclusively by their mothers. However, allomaternal care dramatically increases during the next three months of development to the point where infants generally receive less care from their mothers than from other females. Siblings provide far more care for infants than non-related individuals. Additionally, high-ranking females interact more often with the infants of low-ranking females than vice versa. Allomaternal care is provided most often by juveniles and young adults. Adult females participate far less in alloparental care. This is common among many primate groups and indicates that young females may gain valuable experience in raising infants that will help them in the future. It is important to note that allomaternal nursing (wet nursing) is common in wedge-capped capuchins but very rare among other primates. Even more interesting is that this nursing behavior in wedge-capped capuchins is not correlated with relatedness. This behavior may be an example of reciprocity, where the favor of one female nursing another’s infant is eventually returned. Parasitic nursing has also been observed in wedge-capped capuchins. In these instances, juvenile and young adult females, who are usually higher in the dominance hierarchy, nurse from older females of lower rank. In contrast to allomaternal behavior, parasitic nursing does not appear to give any benefits to the monkey providing the milk. C. olivaceus in French Guiana === Interaction with other species === Wedge-capped capuchins sometimes rub themselves with millipedes they find while foraging. The monkeys rub the millipede against their fur, sometimes for as long as two minutes at a time. They also occasionally put the millipede in their mouths, remove them, and continue to rub them over their bodies. These capuchins often share these millipedes. The purpose of this strange behavior is difficult to determine. One theory is that the millipede, when threatened, releases noxious chemicals as a defense mechanism. These chemicals may act as insect repellants against mosquitos. This behavior is most common during the rainy season, when mosquitos are most prevalent. == Predation == Wedge-capped capuchins have been observed to give alarm calls if they observe a potential predator. Such predators include jaguars, ocelots, tayras, boa constrictors, caimans, and collared peccaries. In addition, alarm calls have been observed when the capuchin sees one of several birds, such as hook-billed kites, black vultures, green ibises, rufous-vented chachalacas, harpy eagles, or ornate hawk-eagles. Due to these predators, the wedge-capped capuchin has taken to living in groups; as group size increases, vigilance per animal decreases, though it has not yet been demonstrated that capuchins in larger groups are any less vulnerable than those in smaller groups. ===Threats and conservation status=== Wedge-capped capuchins are ranked as an animal as least concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. The wedge-capped capuchin is ranked as least concern because the animal is common and has a widespread range. Human hunting is one of the major threats to capuchin survival in some regions. == References == == External links == *Infonatura wedge-capped capuchin Category:Mammals of Brazil Category:Mammals of French Guiana Category:Mammals of Guyana Category:Mammals of Suriname Category:Mammals of Venezuela wedge-capped capuchin wedge-capped capuchin Category:Primates of South America ","title":"Wedge-capped capuchin"},{"id":"3237240","text":"The Mentzer index, described in 1973 by William C. Mentzer, is said to be helpful in differentiating iron deficiency anemia from beta thalassemia. The index is calculated from the results of a complete blood count. If the quotient of the mean corpuscular volume (MCV, in fL) divided by the red blood cell count (RBC, in Millions per microLiter) is less than 13, thalassemia is said to be more likely. If the result is greater than 13, then iron-deficiency anemia is said to be more likely. The principle involved is as follows: In iron deficiency, the marrow cannot produce as many RBCs and they are small (microcytic), so the RBC count and the MCV will both be low, and as a result, the index will be greater than 13. Conversely, in thalassemia, which is a disorder of globin synthesis, the number of RBCs produced is normal, but the cells are smaller and more fragile. Therefore, the RBC count is normal, but the MCV is low, so the index will be less than 13. ==References== Category:Blood tests ","title":"Mentzer index"},{"id":"3237246","text":"Bruce Forsyth's Hot Streak is an American television game show that aired on ABC from January 6 to April 4, 1986. British television personality Bruce Forsyth hosted the series, the only time he hosted a series outside of his native United Kingdom. Gene Wood was the original announcer, with the last two weeks of shows announced by Marc Summers. The show originated as a pilot in 1983 hosted by Gene Rayburn called Party Line. The show was picked up with a few minor changes, mainly Forsyth replacing Rayburn as host and the show title changed. Reg Grundy Productions produced Bruce Forsyth's Hot Streak, which was the first daytime series the Grundy company produced for a network other than NBC. It was also only Grundy's fourth series he attempted in America, after Scrabble, Time Machine, and daytime and syndicated editions of Sale of the Century. To that point, the daytime Sale and Scrabble had been hits while Time Machine and the syndicated Sale were relatively short lived. Bruce Forsyth's Hot Streak was also the last American production for the Grundy Organisation to premiere until 1993. ==Gameplay== Two gender-specific teams of five contestants, one of which was a returning champion, each competed in a game of word association. The challengers, or winners of a coin toss in the case of two new teams, played first. In round one, the captain of the team in control chose one of two words presented by the host. The other four team members wore headphones to ensure they could not hear the word. Once a word was chosen, the team was given 40 seconds to communicate the word down the line. The team captain described the word to the second team member, who, after guessing the word, then did the same for the third team member. The process continued down the line until the team completed the transition down the line, time ran out, the team gave an illegal clue, repeated a key word, gestured or said the word (or a form of the word). The opposing team played the other word in the round. In the second round, the next players in line became the captains and the team trailing after round one chose the first word. In rounds one and two, each successful transition was worth $100, for a maximum of $400 per round. The third and final round started with the trailing team, and each correct transition was worth $200, for a possible $800. The maximum grand total for a game was $1,600. The team with the most money won the game, kept their winnings, and advanced to the bonus round. The losing team received parting gifts, plus their previous winnings if they were returning champions. If the game ended in a tie, the captain of the champion team (or the captain of the team who lost the coin toss, if there were two new teams) was given one final word and opted to play or pass. The team that played the tie-breaker had to communicate the word down the line without faltering to win. If they were unable to do so, the other team won. ==Bonus round== The bonus round involved the members of the winning team trying to come up with words to describe certain people, places, or things. For each subject, Forsyth would show the team captain the subject while his/her teammates were placed in isolation with headphones so they could not hear. The captain then came up with four words that he/she thought best described the subject. Once the captain came up with those four words, the rest of the team came out of isolation and were told the subject. Each of the other four players was given five seconds to guess them (twenty seconds in all). Each time the team came up with a word, it was worth $200. After the twenty seconds was up, a second subject was played for $300 per correct guess. Finally, a third subject was played and if the team came up with all four words their winnings were multiplied by five, for a potential $10,000. If the team could not come up with all four words for the third subject, they kept what they had won in the first two parts of the round. ==Broadcast history== The show originated as an unsold pilot in 1983 hosted by Gene Rayburn called Party Line. The show was picked up by ABC with a few minor changes, mainly Forsyth replacing Rayburn as host (Rayburn had committed to Break the Bank by this time) and the show title changed from Party Line to Hot Streak. The game play for the most part remained unchanged. A pilot hosted by Forsyth was produced in 1984 with Rod Roddy serving as the announcer. Hot Streak was placed in ABC's 11:00 am Eastern/10:00 am Central time slot that was already home to two hit daytime game shows, CBS's The Price Is Right and NBC's Wheel of Fortune. Consequently, Hot Streak was routinely beaten in the ratings and came in a distant third to both shows and ABC decided not to renew the show when its thirteen-week order ended. ==International versions== These were some of the international versions of the (Bruce Forsyth's) Hot Streak format produced: {class= font-size:100% style=\\"width:100% - !width=\\"20%\\" Country !width=\\"30%\\" Local Name !width=\\"20%\\" Host !width=\\"20%\\" Network !width=\\"30%\\" Year Aired -   Hot Streak  James O'Neill  Seven Network  1998 -   Rap Klap  Anne De Baetzelier  VTM  1990–1991 -   Passe à ton voisin  Alexandre Pesle  France 2  June 30, 1997 – September 5, 1997 - rowspan=2   Ruck Zuck  Werner Schulze-Erdel (1988–1991) Jochen Bendel (1992–2000, 2004–2005) Mathias Euler-Rolle (2005) Oliver Geissen (2016–2018)  Tele 5 (1988–1992, 2004–2005) RTL II (1993–1995) tm3 (1995–2000) RTLplus (2016–2018)  1988–2000 2004–2005 2016–2018 -  Kinder Ruck Zuck  Désirée Nosbusch  Tele 5  1992 -  rowspan=2   rowspan=2  Rouk Zouk  Mary Miliaresi  Mega Channel  1994–1997 -  Zeta Makrypoulia  ANT1  2017–present - rowspan=6   Komunikata  Isam Surentu (2000–2005) Indra Bekti (2005)  TPI (now MNCTV)  2000–2005 -  Komunikata Kapten Bintang rowspan=2 Isam Surentu rowspan=2 TPI (now MNCTV)  2001 -  Komunikata Junior  2002 -  Katakan Katamu  Ben Kasyafani rowspan=2 antv  2010–2011 -  Kata Bergaya  Sule and Rizky Febian Uya Kuya (few final episodes)  2014–2015 -  Komunikata Indonesia  Choky Sitohang (March–May 2018) John Martin Tumbel (May 2018–February 2019)  GTV  2018–2019 -   חמש ,חמש Hamesh, Hamesh 5/5   Channel 2  1993–1994 -   Ποйми мeʜя Poymy Menya   НТК  October 5, 2013 – present -   Podaj Dalej  Piotr Wiszniowski Wiesław Tupaczewski  RTL7  1998 2000–2001 - rowspan=2   Ποйми мeʜя Poymy Menya  Oleg Marusev (1995–2000) Matvey Ganapolsky (1995) Eugene Dvorzhetsky (1999) Eugene Stychkin (1999–2000)  ORT NTV  1995–1996 1996–2000 -  Ποйми мeʜя Poymy Menya (Kids edition)  Olga Shelest  Karusel  September 8, 2013 – February 24, 2016 -   Zlatni Krug Golden Circle  Boris Milivojevic and Sofia Rajović  B92  2014–present -   Dame una pista  Luján Argüelles  Cuatro  2010–2011 } ==References== ==External links== * (US) * * \\"Hot Streak\\" @ pearsontv * Information about the \\"Passe à ton voisin\\" 1997 (France) * Ruck Zuck 1988-2000 \\"original\\" version (Germany) * Ruck Zuck 2004-2005 \\"revival\\" version (Germany) * (Germany) * (Greece) Category:1986 American television series debuts Category:1986 American television series endings Category:1980s American game shows Category:American Broadcasting Company original programming Category:English- language television shows Category:Television series by Reg Grundy Productions Category:Television series by Fremantle (company) ","title":"Bruce Forsyth's Hot Streak"},{"id":"3237247","text":"The black capuchin, (Sapajus nigritus), also known as the black-horned capuchin, is a capuchin monkey from the Atlantic Forest in south-eastern Brazil and far north-eastern Argentina. Historically, it was included as a subspecies of the tufted capuchin. == Taxonomy == The black capuchin was originally named Cebus nigritus or Cebus apella nigritus, and while this has been changed, a lot of sources still name the black capuchin as part of the genus Cebus. == Biology == The black capuchin is a social animal. It likes to live in groups, usually consisting of 6 to 20 members, and is hierarchal. Despite the fact that these groups tend to be made up of more females than males, the alpha female of the group is submissive to the alpha male. Communication within groups consists of bodily, facial and vocal communications. One example of this is the 'scream embrace mechanism’, a high pitched called used to regroup (usually male) members of a group. === Habitat === The black capuchin is found in the Atlantic region of North-eastern Argentina and South-eastern Brazil, with its habitat overlapping with other capuchin species. They are considered arboreal, mainly dwelling in the tree canopy, however will also drop to the forest floor to forage, where insects and nuts are most abundant. ==Subspecies== The black capuchin has three subspecies: Sapajus n. nigritus (nominate) and S. n. cucullatus are found in the southern part (the former eastwards, and the latter westwards) of this species' range, and both have a distinctive pair of tufts on the crown, as also suggested by the alternative common name of this species; black-horned capuchin. The last subspecies, the crested or robust tufted capuchin (S. n. robustus) is found in the northern part of this species' range (north of the Doce River), and has a median conical crest on the crown.Rylands, A.

The two southern subspecies remain relatively widespread and are rated as Near Threatened by the IUCN. The distinctive northern subspecies has a far more restricted distribution and it is considered Endangered. ==References== black capuchin Category:Mammals of Brazil Category:Mammals of Argentina Category:Fauna of the Atlantic Forest (biome) black capuchin Category:Primates of South America ","title":"Black capuchin"},{"id":"3237255","text":"The black-striped capuchin (Sapajus libidinosus), also known as the bearded capuchin, is a capuchin monkey from South America.

Adaptations to carrying large stones and fruit include strengthened back and leg muscles that permit the monkey to walk on its hind legs while carrying stones.

Finlay was born in Montreal, the son of James Finlay, who himself was a significant player in the western Canadian fur trade. Finlay was apprenticed as a clerk in the North West Company in 1789 at the age of 15. He accompanied Alexander Mackenzie on his historic trip across the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific Ocean in 1792-93 becoming, with him, the first European to traverse North America. He was placed in charge of the North West Company's Athabasca Department in 1794, and the same year established a trading post at present-day Fort St. John, called Rocky Mountain Fort. This was the first European community established in present-day British Columbia and is the province's oldest continuously inhabited European-founded settlement. In 1797, Finlay revisited Mackenzie's excursion to the Pacific, with a view to taking the north branch of the Peace rather than the southern branch (the Parsnip River) taken by Mackenzie. This northern branch would come to be known as the Finlay River. Finlay perhaps thought that this route might present a less complicated conduit to the Pacific. No record remains of the expedition except in the writings of Samuel Black, who ascended to the source of the Finlay in 1824, noting that \\"he had studied Finlay’s chart.\\" Nonetheless, it would appear from the information Black had that Finlay had only made it as far as the Ingenika River, about 130 km north of the Finlay River's confluence with the Peace. Indeed, Black's journal makes clear that the northern branch, far from being less complicated, was all but impassable in many parts, perhaps explaining Finlay's reluctance to travel more than about one-quarter of the river's actual length. Finlay remained in the North West Company's Athabasca Department, becoming a partner of the company in 1799. He retired from the fur trade in 1804 and returned to Montreal. Little is known of his life there, except that he obtained an appointment as deputy commissary-general. ==References== Category:1774 births Category:1833 deaths Category:Canadian fur traders Category:Explorers of British Columbia ","title":"John Finlay (fur trader)"},{"id":"3237282","text":"Ronnie Singh Jagday (born March 21, 1978 in Vancouver, British Columbia) is an international Canadian field hockey player, who played his first international match for the Canadian Men's National team in 1998, in Barcelona against Spain.

Beard studied at the University of Oxford where he completed his doctoral thesis on tropical forestry. While working with the Forestry Division in Trinidad and Tobago during the 1940s, Beard developed a system of forest classification for Tropical America and described the forests of Trinidad, Tobago, and the Lesser Antilles; these descriptions remain standard references on the topics. After leaving Trinidad, Beard moved to South Africa and then to Australia, where he produced an extensive series of vegetation maps covering much of the country. His extensive surveys of Western Australia set standards for understanding regional floristic zones and biogeographical areas for the whole state. He was the main author of the 1964–1981 explanatory notes to the mapping project of the Vegetation Survey of Western Australia, which involved travelling some 150,000 kilometres.

She was elected at the 2010 federal election, representing the Australian Greens. Prior to her election to the Federal Parliament, Rhiannon was a Greens NSW member of the New South Wales Legislative Council between 1999 and 2010. ==Early life and political activism== Rhiannon was born Lee Brown, the daughter of Bill and Freda Brown, members of the Communist Party of Australia (CPA) from the 1930s, and later, the splinter, Soviet- aligned Socialist Party of Australia (SPA) from the 1970s. From as early as the age of seven, along with her parents, she was under surveillance by the Australian counter-espionage organisation, ASIO. Her membership of the CPA's youth league contributed to ASIO's decision. In 1968, with friends she formed High School Students Against Vietnam War. She completed secondary studies at Sydney Girls High School in 1969 and graduated in 1975 as a Bachelor of Science, majoring in botany and zoology with honours in botany, at the University of New South Wales. She joined the SPA around 1973. In the 1980s she helped organise a \\"peace camp\\" protest outside the joint US-Australian defence facility at Pine Gap, in central Australia. According to Mark Aarons, she left the SPA in the early 1980s. She edited the magazine, Survey: a monthly digest of trends in the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, from 1988 until it ceased publication in 1990. This aspect of her past came under scrutiny when she ran for the Senate. From 1980 to 1982, she was a member of the Women's Advisory Council to the NSW government, and in the same period was the NSW secretary of the Union of Australian Women. She attended the World Congress of Women in Moscow in 1987. In the 1980s, she was also a journalist \\"for unions including the Maritime Union of Australia.\\" She founded the Coalition for Gun Control in 1988 and AID/WATCH in 1993. She joined the Greens in 1990. In the 1990s, she worked at the Rainforest Information Centre, campaigning against the logging of tropical forest. In 1977, Brown married Pat O'Gorman, but they separated in the late 1980s. During her marriage she used the surname \\"O'Gorman.\\" They had three children. Following their separation, she adopted the surname \\"Rhiannon\\", the name of a figure from Welsh mythology. ==Parliamentary career== ===New South Wales Legislative Council (1999–2010)=== Lee Rhiannon at a press briefing in 2007 Rhiannon contested the New South Wales Legislative Council at the 1999 state election for the Australian Greens. She was elected with three percent of the statewide vote, joining fellow Green Ian Cohen in the state's upper house. She was re-elected with over nine percent of the vote at the 2007 state election, taking her seat with three other Greens MLCs. Rhiannon used her New South Wales maiden parliamentary speech in 1999 to announce her opposition to a development proposal by the Carr Labor Government for Walsh Bay. Rhiannon called on the Labor Party to advance instead the party's constitutional ideals for \\"redistribution of political and economic power\\" and \\"the development of public enterprises based upon... forms of social ownership\\". Rhiannon also spoke against Australia's British colonial legacy and announced that she was the first MLC to sit in the NSW Parliament without the title \\"Honourable\\". She spoke of her family's involvement in the labour movement and acknowledged her parents' membership of the Communist Party of Australia and said she was proud of their tradition of \\"optimistic social activism\\". She reiterated Greens opposition to privatisation of public assets and to the Howard Government's Goods and Services Tax. Rhiannon served on the following committees in state parliament: General Purpose Standing Committees, Joint Select Committees on the Cross City Tunnel, a Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, a Standing Committee on Law and Justice, a Select Committee on the NSW Taxi Industry, a Select Committee on the Increase in Prisoner Population, and a Committee on the Office of the Ombudsman and Police Integrity Commission. In November 2002, in the week prior to protests against the World Trade Organization in Sydney, Rhiannon spoke in support of the protesters and organised a public conference on Civil Disobedience at the NSW Parliament. Rhiannon spoke against police actions during the S11 Protests, which violently protested against meetings of the World Economic Forum in Melbourne in 2000. Rhiannon called on Police Minister Michael Costa to guarantee that police violence would not be used against protesters in Sydney. Costa in return called on Rhiannon to resign for hosting the civil disobedience seminar. Rhiannon lobbied the Vatican against considering the Archbishop of Sydney, George Pell, for the position of Pope because of his conservative views. In 2007 she referred him to the parliamentary privileges committee, alleging \\"contempt of parliament\\" for comments he made in opposition to embryonic stem cell research legislation. During her term in the NSW Parliament, she was the Greens NSW parliamentary spokesperson for the following portfolio areas: : Firearms; Donations; Mineral Resources; Roads; Transport; Health; Sexuality and Gender Identity; Electoral Issues; Industrial Relations; Attorney General; Parliamentary Process; Ports & Waterways; Gaming & Racing; Youth; South East NSW; Women; Animal Welfare; Rural Affairs; Science; and the Hunter region. ===Australian Senate (2011–2018)=== Rhiannon contested and won a seat in the Australian Senate for New South Wales at the August 2010 federal election for the Australian Greens. She resigned from the NSW Legislative Council when the federal election was called, with a ballot of party members selecting Cate Faehrmann to fill the casual vacancy. Rhiannon was elected with 10.7 percent of the statewide vote. She would share the balance of power with eight other Greens senators from July 2011. At the December 2010 NSW Greens State Conference a resolution was adopted in support of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) campaign against Israel. In support of the statement, Rhiannon said that the BDS campaign was \\"motivated by the universal principles of freedom, justice and equal rights\\". Following her election as a Senator, she continued supporting the BDS campaign saying, \\"I see the value of that tactic as a way to promoting Palestinian human rights.\\" Subsequently, the Greens federal leader Bob Brown said that he had conveyed his disapproval of this policy emphasis to Rhiannon, saying that, \\"it was damaging to the Greens campaign\\". Rhiannon took up her seat in the Australian Senate on 1 July 2011 and in August 2011 it was reported that Rhiannon had refused to back away from the BDS campaign. In December 2011, the NSW Greens abandoned their official support for an international boycott against Israel and resolved to actively support the Australian Greens position. Rhiannon said that this \\"recognises the legitimacy of the BDS campaign as a political tactic and also recognises that there is a diversity of views in the community and the Greens.\\" Announcing portfolio responsibilities for the Australian Greens in June 2011, Bob Brown allocated Rhiannon the following portfolios: Democracy; Local Government; Higher Education; Assisting on National Security; Women; International Aid and Development; Animal Welfare; and Forests. As of May 2014, Rhiannon held the following portfolios: Animal Welfare; Democracy & Local Government; Forests; Higher Education; International Aid & Development; Transport; Water & Murray Darling Basin.Portfolios: Lee Rhiannon Greens MP. During July 2016, Bob Brown, a former Leader of the Australian Greens, called on Rhiannon to resign citing the \\"need for renewal\\". Brown labeled Rhiannon as a member of the \\"old guard\\" who caused the Greens' vote in New South Wales to lag behind in the 2016 Federal Election. Following the announcement of the 2016 Senate election results, other Senators negotiated, against Rhiannon's objections, to allocate her a three-year rather than a six-year Senate term. In June 2017 Rhiannon was suspended from the Federal Greens party room following an internal dispute over her opposition to the Federal Greens' support for the Turnbull government education funding changes. Most reports suggested the dispute centred on the manner of Rhiannon's dissent from the party position and the broader implications for the processes of decision making. The Greens New South Wales subsequently issued a statement reiterating its support for Senator Rhiannon and support for public education. In the lead up to preselection for the Greens NSW Senate position in 2017 it was reported that Rhiannon had breached party rules by using her Sydney electorate office as a point of contact for supporters. The allegations were contested by Rhiannon's supporters. She subsequently lost the first position on the Greens NSW Senate ticket for the 2019 Australian federal election to NSW Greens MLC Mehreen Faruqi. On 25 May 2018, Rhiannon announced she would resign as a Senator in mid-August, with Faruqi to be nominated to fill the resulting casual vacancy. Rhiannon gave her valedictory speech in the Senate on 13 August 2018, warning the Greens to \\"resist careerism, hierarchical control, bullying behaviour and associated leaking and backgrounding\\". She formally resigned her Senate position on 15 August 2018. ==Post-parliamentary life== In 2018, Rhiannon was elected as a committee member of the SEARCH Foundation, the legal successor of the old CPA. In 2019 she held talks at the Marxism 2019 conference about the anti-nuclear movement and the Prices and Incomes Accord. Rhiannon attended the Blockade IMARC protests in October 2019. == See also == *Left Renewal *Anti-Zionism ==References== ==External links== *NSW Greens Homepage *Australian Greens Homepage *lee-rhiannon.greensmps.org.au – official website * Summary of parliamentary voting for Senator Lee Rhiannon on TheyVoteForYou.org.au Category:1951 births Category:Living people Category:University of New South Wales alumni Category:Australian Greens members of the Parliament of Australia Category:Members of the Australian Senate Category:Members of the Australian Senate for New South Wales Category:Women members of the Australian Senate Category:Members of the New South Wales Legislative Council Category:Australian Greens members of the Parliament of New South Wales Category:21st-century Australian politicians Category:21st-century Australian women politicians Category:Women members of the New South Wales Legislative Council Category:People educated at Sydney Girls High School ","title":"Lee Rhiannon"},{"id":"3237300","text":"Martins's tamarin, Saguinus martinsi, is a species of tamarin endemic to Brazil. ==References== *Infonatura Martins's tamarin Category:Mammals of Brazil Category:Endemic fauna of Brazil Martins's tamarin ","title":"Martins's tamarin"},{"id":"3237310","text":"Ravinder \\"Ravi\\" Kahlon (born May 15, 1979 in Victoria, British Columbia) is a Canadian politician and field hockey player.

Kahlon was a student at Camosun College in Victoria, British Columbia at the time. He earned his first international senior cap for the Men's National Team in 2000 against Malaysia in Brussels. Eventually competing at every level of international competition, Kahlon's career would include playing three times in Hockey World Cup qualifying tournaments, representing Canada at the Commonwealth Games and Pan American Games, and a tenth-place finish at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. In 2013, Kahlon was inducted into the Delta Sports Hall of Fame. In October 2016, Kahlon announced he would be running for office in the 2017 British Columbia provincial election with the British Columbia New Democratic Party (BC NDP). Kahlon won the NDP nomination in Delta North, an electoral district in Delta, British Columbia, a suburban city in Metro Vancouver. Delta North is considered a swing district, having been won three times each by the BC NDP and British Columbia Liberal Party in the six elections prior to 2017. When the election was held on May 9, 2017, Kahlon defeated Liberal incumbent Scott Hamilton by a margin of 9.14 percentage points. The 2017 British Columbia election resulted in a hung parliament, with no party controlling a majority of seats in the Legislative Assembly. However, the NDP was eventually able to form a minority government with the support of the Green Party of British Columbia. The NDP government was sworn in on July 18, 2017, with new Premier John Horgan naming Kahlon as Parliamentary Secretary for Sport and Multiculturalism. Kahlon supported eventual winner Jagmeet Singh for leader of the federal New Democratic Party in that party's 2017 leadership election. == Electoral record == ==International senior competitions== * 2000 — Olympic Games, Sydney (10th) * 2001 — World Cup Qualifier, Edinburgh (8th) * 2002 — Commonwealth Games, Manchester (6th) * 2003 — Pan American Games, Santo Domingo (2nd) * 2004 — Olympic Qualifying Tournament, Madrid (11th) * 2004 — Pan American Cup, London (2nd) * 2006 — Commonwealth Games, Melbourne (9th) * 2007 — Pan American Games, Rio de Janeiro (1st) * 2008 — Olympic Games, Beijing (10th) ==References== *Canadian Olympic Committee Category:1979 births Category:Canadian male field hockey players Category:Field hockey players at the 2000 Summer Olympics Category:Field hockey players at the 2002 Commonwealth Games Category:Field hockey players at the 2006 Commonwealth Games Category:Field hockey players at the 2007 Pan American Games Category:Field hockey players at the 2008 Summer Olympics Category:Living people Category:Olympic field hockey players of Canada Category:Politicians from Victoria, British Columbia Category:Sportspeople from Victoria, British Columbia Category:Canadian people of Indian descent Category:Canadian people of Punjabi descent Category:Canadian Sikhs Category:Canadian sportsperson- politicians Category:Pan American Games gold medalists for Canada Category:Pan American Games silver medalists for Canada Category:Pan American Games medalists in field hockey Category:Commonwealth Games competitors for Canada Category:Canadian sportspeople of Indian descent Category:British Columbia New Democratic Party MLAs Category:Canadian politicians of Indian descent ","title":"Ravi Kahlon"},{"id":"3237312","text":"The black-mantled tamarin, Leontocebus nigricollis, is a species of saddle- back tamarin from the northwestern Amazon in far western Brazil, southeastern Colombia, northeastern Peru and Ecuador.

It Happened in Brooklyn was Sinatra's third film for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, who had purchased his contract from RKO because Louis B. Mayer was a huge Sinatra fan.Turner Classic Movies The film contains six songs written by Sammy Cahn and Jule Styne, and included \\"The Song's Gotta Come From the Heart\\" (performed as a duet by Sinatra and Durante), \\"The Brooklyn Bridge\\", \\"Whose Baby Are You\\", \\"I Believe\\", \\"Time After Time\\", and \\"It's the Same Old Dream\\". ==Plot== A post-World War II feel-good movie, It Happened in Brooklyn begins in England at the end of the war. Danny Miller (Frank Sinatra) is with a group of GIs awaiting transportation home to the US. On his last night there, he meets Jamie Shellgrove (Peter Lawford), who is a very shy young man whose grandfather feels should be taken under someone's wing. After observing Miller come to his grandson's aid at the piano, he asks Danny to speak with his son, to give him \\"some words of encouragement\\". In order to look good in front of the Brooklyn-born nurse (Gloria Grahame) who scolded him for not making friends, he agrees, even going so far as to saying what would really fix Jamie up would be for him to come to Brooklyn. As he rushes out to catch his transport to the docks for the voyage home, Danny discovers that Jamie is really the heir to a duke. Upon Danny's return to Brooklyn, the film revolves around characters realizing their dreams of escaping working-class drudgery: in Sinatra's case to become a singer/musician rather than a shipping clerk, in Lawford's case to break out of his extreme shyness to gain a wife and a career as a songwriter, and in Grayson's case to break out of her school teaching job to star in the opera (although this last is not shown coming to pass, but she presumably lives happily ever after as she is brought to England as the fiancée of the Lawford character, who is heir to a dukedom). The story ends with Danny realizing the nurse he talked to at the start of the film is the only girl for him, and since he figures she's got to be back in Brooklyn herself, and he's got all kinds of friends now, he's optimistic about finding and winning her. The film's tagline was \\"Happy songs! Happy stars! Happy romance!\\". Lawford dances while singing a song, a performance that was particularly well received by both critics and public, outshining future fellow Rat Pack member Sinatra. One highlight of the film is seeing and hearing Sinatra and Grayson singing \\"Là ci darem la mano\\" from Mozart's 1787 opera Don Giovanni. ==Cast== * Frank Sinatra as Danny Webson Miller * Kathryn Grayson as Anne Fielding * Peter Lawford as Jamie Shellgrove * Jimmy Durante as Nick Lombardi * Gloria Grahame as Nurse * Marcy McGuire as Rae Jakobi * Aubrey Mather as Digby John * Tamara Shayne as Mrs. Kardos * William Roy as Leo Kardos (as Billy Roy) * William Haade as Police Sergeant ==Bobby Long== The movie also features the film debut of a multi-talented preteen actor, Bobby Long, who after filming, mysteriously disappeared from the spotlight without any explanation. His character, Johnny O'Brien, is described as being the littlest student at New Utrecht High School. He usually sneaks into the school gym at night to do some acrobatic exercises so he can grow as tall as the rest of his classmates. One night as Danny and Nick were about to have dinner, Nick decides to close the gym windows with Danny's help. Suddenly, they're intruded by Johnny as he does his somersault exercises. The duo meets the boy and learns about his dilemma and help him realize his potential by showing some support and faith with the tune 'I Believe'. Johnny then shows them how amazingly talented he truly is by singing and tap dancing around them before showing off a big acrobatic stunt finale. Johnny O'Brien appears in the movie in 4 1/2 scenes and has 6 lines in total. His final appearance was the concert scene at the record shop where Leo Kardos performs his piano solo. Bobby Long never got to appear in another movie after doing IHIB. Neither did he ever appear in any other media presentation like radio, tv, etc. There was also a rumor that claimed he suffered a horrible accident doing the big dance number. No one ever went looking for him or his family since. Information into Long's disappearance has yet to be investigated. ==Filming== The original director was supposed to be George Sidney, but he was replaced by Richard Whorf, who is probably best known for his television directing, particularly The Beverly Hillbillies, Gunsmoke and My Three Sons. Filming was interrupted for approximately ten days when Durante had to go and finish filming on This Time for Keeps. The piano solos in the film were performed by the pianist and composer André Previn. ==Box office== The film earned $1,877,000 in the US and Canada and $787,000 elsewhere, resulting a loss of $138,000. Variety says the film earned $2,150,000 in rentals.\\"Top Grossers of 1947\\", Variety, 7 January 1948 p 63 ==Critical reception== It Happened in Brooklyn was generally well received, Variety noting that: \\"Much of the lure will result from Frank Sinatra's presence in the cast. Guy's acquired the Bing Crosby knack of nonchalance, throwing away his gag lines with fine aplomb. He kids himself in a couple of hilarious sequences and does a takeoff on Jimmy Durante, with Durante aiding him, that's sockeroo.\\" ==References* * * Review, Variety Category:1947 films Category:1947 musical comedy films Category:1947 romantic comedy films Category:American musical comedy films Category:American romantic comedy films Category:American films Category:American romantic musical films Category:American black-and-white films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Richard Whorf Category:Films set in Brooklyn Category:Films set in England Category:Films set in New York City Category:Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer films Category:1947 comedy films ","title":"It Happened in Brooklyn"},{"id":"3237317","text":"In Greek mythology, Corycia (Ancient Greek: Κωρύκια Korykia) or Corycis (Kôrukis), was a naiad who lived on Mount Parnassus in Phocis.

Individuals with this disorder lose the ability to understand language, repeat words, and write from dictation. Some patients with AVA describe hearing spoken language as meaningless noise, often as though the person speaking was doing so in a foreign language. However, spontaneous speaking, reading, and writing are preserved. The maintenance of the ability to process non-speech auditory information, including music, also remains relatively more intact than spoken language comprehension. Individuals who exhibit pure word deafness are also still able to recognize non-verbal sounds. The ability to interpret language via lip reading, hand gestures, and context clues is preserved as well. Sometimes, this agnosia is preceded by cortical deafness; however, this is not always the case. Researchers have documented that in most patients exhibiting auditory verbal agnosia, the discrimination of consonants is more difficult than that of vowels, but as with most neurological disorders, there is variation among patients. Auditory verbal agnosia (AVA) is not the same as auditory agnosia; patients with (nonverbal) auditory agnosia have a relatively more intact speech comprehension system despite their impaired recognition of nonspeech sounds. ==Presentation== Auditory verbal agnosia can be referred to as a pure aphasia because it has a high degree of specificity. Despite an inability to comprehend speech, patients with auditory verbal agnosia typically retain the ability to hear and process non-speech auditory information, speak, read and write. This specificity suggests that there is a separation between speech perception, non-speech auditory processing, and central language processing. In support of this theory, there are cases in which speech and non-speech processing impairments have responded differentially to treatment. For example, some therapies have improved writing comprehension in patients over time, while speech remained critically impaired in those same patients. The term \\"pure word deafness\\" is something of a misnomer. By definition, individuals with pure word deafness are not deaf – in the absence of other impairments, these individuals have normal hearing for all sounds, including speech. The term \\"deafness\\" originates from the fact that individuals with AVA are unable to comprehend speech that they hear. The term \\"pure word\\" refers to the fact that comprehension of verbal information is selectively impaired in AVA. For this reason, AVA is distinct from other auditory agnosias in which the recognition of nonspeech sounds is impaired. Classical (or pure) auditory agnosia is an inability to process environmental sounds. Interpretive or receptive agnosia (amusia) is an inability to understand music. Patients with pure word deafness complain that speech sounds simply do not register, or that they tend not to come up. Other claims include speech sounding as if it were in a foreign language, the words having a tendency to run together, or the feeling that speech was simply not connected to the patient's voice. ==Causes== Auditory verbal agnosia has been shown to form as a result of tumor formation, especially in the posterior third ventricle, trauma, lesions, cerebral infarction, encephalitis as a result of herpes simplex, and Landaui- Kleffner syndrome. The exact location of damage which results in pure word deafness is still under debate, but the planum temporale, posterior STG, and white matter damage to the acoustic radiations (AR) have all been implicated. Auditory verbal agnosia is rarely diagnosed in its pure form. Auditory verbal agnosia can both present as the result of acute damage or as chronic, progressive degeneration over time. Cases have been documented that result from severe acute head trauma resulting in bilateral temporal lobe damage. In contrast, auditory verbal agnosia has also been documented to present progressively over several years. In one such case, the patient exhibited progressive word deafness over a 9-year period but did not exhibit any other cognitive of mental deterioration. MRIs showed cortical atrophy in the left superior temporal lobe region. In childhood, auditory verbal agnosia can also be caused by Landau-Kleffner syndrome, also called acquired epileptic aphasia. It is often the first symptom of this disease. A review of 45 cases suggested a relationship between prognosis and age of onset with poorer prognosis for those with earlier onset. In extremely rare cases, auditory verbal agnosia has been known to present as a symptom of neurodegenerative disease, such as Alzheimer's disease. In such cases auditory verbal agnosia is a symptom that is typically followed by more severe neurological symptoms typical of Alzheimer's disease. ==Diagnosis== There is no uniform performance among patients with auditory verbal agnosia; therefore it is not possible to attribute specific phonetic or phonological deficits to the syndrome. In order to diagnose AVA, two intact abilities need to be established: * Words that are heard must have undergone adequate acoustic analysis as evidenced by correct repetition; * The semantic representation of the word must be intact as evidenced by immediate comprehension of the word when presented in written form. If both of these criteria are met and lack of auditory verbal comprehension is apparent, a diagnosis of AVA may follow. In at least one instance, the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination has been used to profile AVA. This method was able to show that the patient experienced marked difficulty in speech perception with minor to no minor deficits in production, reading, and writing, fitting the profile of AVA. While this provides a well- known example, other verbal-audio test batteries can and have also been used to diagnose pure speech deafness. ===Cognitive deficits=== Auditory verbal agnosia is the inability to distinguish phonemes. In some patients with unilateral auditory verbal agnosia, there is evidence that the ability to acoustically process speech signals is affected at the prephonemic level, preventing the conversion of these signals into phonemes. There are two predominate hypotheses that address what happens within the language center of the brain in people that have AVA. One of the hypotheses is that an early stage of auditory analysis is impaired. The fact that AVA patients have the ability to read shows that both the semantic system and the speech output lexicon are intact. The second hypotheses suggests that there is either a complete or partial disconnection of the auditory input lexicon from the semantic system. This would suggest that entries in the lexicon can still be activated but they cannot go on to cause subsequent semantic activation. In relation to these two different hypotheses, researchers in one study differentiated between two different types of AVA. According to this study, one form of AVA is a deficit at the prephonemic level and is related to the inability to comprehend rapid changes in sound. This form of AVA is associated with bilateral temporal lobe lesions. Speech perception in patients with this form of AVA has been shown to improve significantly in understanding when the pace of speech is drastically slowed. The second type of AVA that the study discusses is a deficit in linguistic discrimination that does not adhere to a prephonemic pattern. This form is associated with left unilateral temporal lobe lesions and may even be considered a form of Wernicke's aphasia. Often individuals diagnosed with auditory verbal agnosia are also incapable of discriminating between non-verbal sounds as well as speech. The underlying problem seems to be temporal in that understanding speech requires the discrimination between specific sounds which are closely spaced in time. Note that this is not unique to speech; studies using non-speech sounds closely spaced in time (dog bark, phone ring, lightning, etc.) have shown that those with auditory verbal agnosia are unable to discriminate between those sounds in the majority of cases, though a few putative examples of speech-specific impairment have been documented in the literature. ===Neurological deficits=== Auditory verbal agnosia is caused by bilateral damage, often in the form of cerebrovascular accidents which form as a result of an embolism, to the posterior superior temporal lobes or disruption of connections between these areas. A unilateral lesion in the left or right superior temporal lobe can also result in pure word deafness, this being much more common in the left hemisphere than the right. It is often associated with lesions to the left posterior superior temporal lobe, but no such unilateral case has yet been documented without damage to the white matter tract connecting superior temporal lobes bilaterally or bilateral damage to the superior temporal lobe. In cases where unilateral damage to the left superior temporal lobe has been documented, patients exhibited problems processing both speech and non-speech sounds (in other words, not typical of auditory verbal agnosia). These facts, in combination with the existence of cases of damage to these white matter tracts without detectable cortical damage, in combination with cases of pure word deafness resulting enlargement of the third ventricle alone suggest that the disorder results from damage to the left-right superior temporal circuit rather than the superior temporal area on one hemisphere or the other. Many of the bilateral cases share one essential feature: after the first (unilateral) lesion, speech perception was typically intact after an initial period of disturbance. Only after the second lesion (in the other hemisphere) were permanent speech perception problems the consistent outcome. The fact that most of these patients only manifested auditory verbal agnosia subsequent to the second lesion supports the hypothesis that both sides of the superior temporal gyrus are necessary. Auditory verbal agnosia is rarely diagnosed in its pure form. Auditory verbal agnosia can present as the result of acute damage or chronic, progressive degeneration over time. Cases have been documented that result from severe acute head trauma resulting in bilateral temporal lobe damage. In contrast, auditory verbal agnosia has also been documented to present progressively over several years. In one such case, the patient exhibited progressive word deafness over a 9-year period but did not exhibit any other cognitive of mental deterioration. This patient was found, using MRIs, to have cortical atrophy in the left superior temporal lobe region. ==Treatments== ===Sign language therapy=== Sign language therapy has been identified as one of the top five most common treatments for auditory verbal agnosia. This type of therapy is most useful because, unlike other treatment methods, it does not rely on fixing the damaged areas of the brain. This is particularly important with AVA cases because it has been so hard to identify the causes of the agnosia in the first place, much less treat those areas directly. Sign language therapy, then, allows the person to cope and work around the disability, much in the same way it helps deaf people. In the beginning of therapy, most will work on identifying key objects and establishing an initial core vocabulary of signs. After this, the patient graduates to expand the vocabulary to intangible items or items that are not in view or present. Later, the patient learns single signs and then sentences consisting of two or more signs. In different cases, the sentences are first written down and then the patient is asked to sign them and speak them simultaneously.Doyle, Patrick J., and Audrey L. Holland. Clinical Management of Patient with Pure Word Deafness. Veterans Administration Medical Center and University of Pittsburgh, n.d. Web. 5 Nov. 2013. Because different AVA patients vary in the level of speech or comprehension they have, sign language therapy learning order and techniques are very specific to the individual's needs. === Tumor removal === In incidents where tumors and their pressure effects are the cause of pure word deafness, removal of the tumor has been shown to allow for the return of most auditory verbal comprehension. === Treatments used for Landau-Kleffner syndrome === ====Intravenous immunoglobulin therapy==== Treating auditory verbal agnosia with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is controversial because of its inconsistency as a treatment method. Although IVIG is normally used to treat immune diseases, some individuals with auditory verbal agnosia have responded positively to the use of IVIG. Additionally, patients are more likely to relapse when treated with IVIG than other pharmacological treatments. IVIG is, thus, a controversial treatment as its efficacy in treating auditory verbal agnosia is dependent upon each individual and varies from case to case. ====Diazepam therapy==== In a study conducted by Masaaki Nagafuchi et al. (1993), a 7-year- old girl began taking a dose of 2 mg diazepam orally every day. She demonstrated major improvements in behavior and comprehension of speech while under diazepam therapy. Within a month, conversation problems were eliminated. After a year of therapy, her repetition ability was almost normal. After two years, her ability to discriminate monosyllabic words was within the normal range. Her audiological recognition had remained normal from the time of onset (i.e., she could recognize familiar noises such as a baby crying or a telephone ringing). ==See also== * Auditory agnosia * Auditory processing disorder * Deafness ==References== Category:Audiology Category:Deafness Category:Language disorders Category:Agnosia Category:Dementia ","title":"Auditory verbal agnosia"},{"id":"3237322","text":"The black tamarin (Saguinus niger) or black-handed tamarin, is a species of tamarin endemic to Brazil. ==Description== Black-handed tamarins are among the smallest primates, weighing approximately 500 grams. As with other tamarins, the hind limbs are longer than the forelimbs and the thumbs are not opposable. With the exception of the big toe, there are claws on all fingers and toes, as well as two molars on each side of the jaw. The face of the black tamarin is generally hairless. The fur is blackish-brown with lighter markings on the back, similar to the red-handed tamarin but without the reddish-orange feet and hands of that species. The black-handed tamarin was previously regarded as a subspecies of the red-handed tamarin. == Distribution and habitat == The geographic range of black-handed tamarins, which are endemic to Pará, Brazil, is limited by the Rio Amazonas (Amazon River) to the North, the Rio Tocantins (Tocantins River) to the East, the Rio Xingu (Xingu River) to the West, and until recently, the Rio Gradaus (Gradaus River) to the South. Photographic evidence of a black-handed tamarin in Confresa, a town in the northeastern region of the state of Mato Grosso, indicates an increase in the species' geographic range to the South. Some marmosets occupy small areas of forest in the Tapajós and Madeira Basins, but the black-handed tamarin is absent from these regions due to lack of food resources. However, this species is considered to be more tolerant of habitat disturbances than other Callitrichides. Black-handed tamarins are arboreal primates that prefer semi- deciduous forest for ease of foraging and thick growth as cover from aerial and terrestrial predators. Due to deforestation in eastern Brazil, black- handed tamarins regularly rely on fragmented and disturbed secondary forest habitats. Although much of the forest canopy has been destroyed, and black- handed tamarins have been seen moving through all levels of the forest, they are most active in the lower to middle (5-15m) strata of the forest. ==Taxonomy== Based on mitochondrial DNA analysis, black tamarins were found to be closer related to populations on the same side of the Tocantins River than on the other, showing that the river constitutes an effective gene flow barrier. As a consequence of the genetic divergence, as well as minor differences in pelage color, some recent authorities have argued for recognizing the population east of the Tocantins River as S. ursula, leaving the \\"true\\" S. niger for the population west of this river. The closest living relative of the black tamarin is thought to be the red-handed tamarin (S. midas). ==Foraging behavior== The species makes use of both primary and secondary forest during foraging, keeping primarily to the canopy and spending minimal time on the ground. Black-handed tamarins subsist largely on fruit. During the dry season (November through January), when fruit is scarcer, they will also take arthropods such as grasshoppers and crickets, and eat the gum of Parkia pendula, an evergreen tree. Even during the dry season, however, fruit from Tetragastris altissima and Inga alba trees is available. During the wet season, over 90 percent of the diet is fruit from as many as nine different species of trees, including Inga stipularis, Inga edulis, Bagassa guianensis, Pouteria lucuma, Pourouma guianesis, Manilkara bidentata, and Chrysophyllum sp.. The seeds of many of these fruits are ingested and defecated. This process plays an important role in the regeneration of forests that are continuously threatened by logging. == Predators == Due to the black- handed tamarin’s small size, they are considered prey by many other animals. Their predators include man, diurnal birds of prey, snakes, and various cat species including margay and ocelot, which are capable arboreal hunters. Because black-handed tamarins have both aerial and terrestrial predators, they utilize any tree or bundled, thick foliage into which they can climb, and they maintain a group sleep system to keep safe while resting at night. The black- handed tamarin's social structure serves as an important line of defense against their predators. While much of their day is spent foraging, each individual keeps a lookout for predators and uses calls to alert their social unit. Although intimidating displays may be made toward predators or in territorial defense, the black-handed tamarin's primary defense is flight. The group aspect of their social structure is important to survival, as a single black-handed tamarin would not be able to forage and keep watch for predators safely and effectively. ==Reproduction== === Breeding behavior === Tamarins typically live in extended family groups of 4 to 15 individuals. Although groups of tamarins may have more than one female per group, only one typically breeds (with the exception of Goeldi's marmoset). Dominant female callitrichids suppress the reproductive activity of their daughters and other subordinate females within their family group. Because daughters of dominant females and other females born and remaining in a group tend not to ovulate, when a female becomes sexually mature, there are two options: either find another group or stay in the natal group. In the latter case, the daughter may someday become the dominant female, or she may cease to ovulate. Daughters may compete for the role of dominant female with their siblings. Subordinate members do not generally engage in sexual reproduction. All adult black-handed tamarin participate in raising and caring for the young, including non- reproductive members of the group (which may number 2-20 members). Group members coordinate and work together to find sufficient food items for infants and juveniles. Unlike many primate groups that provide juveniles with small amounts of food, this species has a cooperative breeding system that shares a substantial portion of food with the juveniles. When group size is large, the breeding male often spends less time attending to his own young because of the universal group effort. When there is sufficient food, or if the dominant female is close to the end of her reproductive cycle, multiple females may be allowed to reproduce in a group. A number of mating variations have been observed: monogamy, polygyny, polyandry, or polygynandy. === Lifetime reproduction === Ovulation in female tamarins typically occurs between 12 and 17 months of age, whereas in male tamarins, sperm production occurs slightly later at about 13 to 18 months. The birth of infants has been observed in both early January and mid July. Black-handed tamarins (like all other Callitrichids) usually produce fraternal twins, but litters may consist of 2-4 infants. Triplets and quadruplets usually only occur in captivity. The growth of infants is very rapid; infants become independent within five months. Female callitrichids are able to conceive again after 2–4 weeks of giving birth to their previous offspring. ==Conservation== The black-handed tamarin is classified as Vulnerable by the IUCN as a result of a 30% decrease in population size over the last 18 years, and is likely to become endangered if conservation measures are not taken. Because the major threat to the species appears to be a loss of suitable habitat, habitat conservation is thought to be key in their survival. The range of the black-handed tamarin is within one of the most densely inhabited areas of Brazil, where logging has removed a significant amount of the original forest, causing a decrease in food availability and refuges from predators. However, black-handed tamarins are adaptable foragers that can make use of primary, secondary and logged forests, which increases the potential available range of habitat. Populations are present in several reserves where logging is prohibited, including Gurupí Biological Reserve, Tapirapé Biological Reserve, and Caxiuanã National Forest. In central-western Brazil, in the southern part of their range, most black- handed tamarins are only able to survive in the remains of forested areas on private properties. ==References== black tamarin Category:Mammals of Brazil Category:Endemic fauna of Brazil black tamarin ","title":"Black tamarin"},{"id":"3237327","text":"The moustached tamarin (Saguinus mystax) is a New World monkey and a species of tamarin. Tamarins are the first branch of the Callitrichidae tree. The moustached tamarin is named for the lack of coloring in the facial hair surrounding their mouth, appearing similar to a moustache. As with all New World monkeys, the moustached tamarin is found only in areas of Central and South America. There are 2 subspecies of the moustached tamarin: * Spix's moustached tamarin, Saguinus mystax mystax * White-rumped moustached tamarin, Saguinus mystax pluto == Description == Monkeys are classified into two groups, the Old World Monkeys and New World Monkeys. The New World Monkeys are called the platyrrhines, which means flat-nosed. This group of primates consists of five families. Old World monkeys are named the catarrhines and are the sister group to the New World Monkeys. Their form of nose differentiates the two groups. New World Monkeys have a flat, broad nose with a wide septum that separates their nostrils in an outward direction. Old World Monkeys, like humans and apes, have a narrower nose, with downward-facing nostrils and a thin septum. Other disparities include the presence of sitting pads on Old World Monkeys, which New World Monkeys lack and differences in manual dexterity and tail capabilities. Moustached tamarins have a lifespan of about 20 years. They are small, weighing only 500 to 600 grams, even less than a Chihuahua. They range in length from 30 to 92 centimeters, and the adult females are larger than adult males. Moustached tamarin monkeys are characterized by white, curly hair around their mouth, similar to a moustache. Their face is flat with almond-like shaped eyes. Their ears are furry and large, and they have long, silky, body hair. They have a brownish-black body with a white moustache and white nose. They have tegula, which are claw-like nails, on each digit except their big toe . These claws allow them to easily cling to trees while they feed. They have conical or spatulate incisors, which are used for cutting food, and are smaller than their canines. The lingual and labial sides of their incisors have a thick layer of enamel. Unlike most New World Monkeys, the moustached tamarin monkey has non-opposable thumbs and lacks a prehensile tail. === Vision === Heterozygous females, which make up about 60% of the female tamarin population, have trichromatic vision, while the remaining moustached tamarin population have dichromatic vision. Trichromatic vision is the capacity to see a broader range of color due to the presence of three color receptors in the retina, at the back of the eye, allowing them to distinguish between greens, blues and reds. Humans, as well as most species of Old World Monkeys, have trichromatic visual abilities; however, some female New World monkeys do as well. Dichromatic vision is a form of color vision in which only two of the primary colors are perceived. Trichromatic vision is an evolutionary adaptation that enables females to more easily find and identify fruit. Color vision is a contributing factor for leadership selection in troops. === Habitat, Lifestyle and Locomotion === Moustached Tamarin in Serra do Divisor National Park, Acre, Brazil Moustached tamarins are inhabitants of tropical rainforests in Brazil, Bolivia and Peru. They live in arid, upland forests in the Amazonian lowland, mostly occupying higher tree branches. They are arboreal, diurnal and precocial. Tamarins walk and run on all fours, similar to squirrels and use their claws for stability. The moustached tamarin monkey exercises three types of locomotion. Symmetrical quadrupedalism is the most frequently used locomotion type, followed by asymmetric quadrupedalism, and leaping. The kind of leap depends on the layer of the forest they occupy. In the lower canopy “trunk-to-trunk” leaps are performed . These are jumps that are short and quick, only reaching a length of 1 to 2 meters. While standing on a medium or large-sized trunk, they propel themselves into the air and land on their front limbs on another trunk. They perform “bounding” leaps which allow them to cross between discontinuous trees, extending their legs farther out, reaching up to 2 meters. In the high canopy, they perform “acrobatic” leaps. These are longer leaps, reaching 5 meters or more, used to travel between treetops. While in the air, they use their tail to decelerate their body before landing on the crown of a nearby tree. === Diet === Moustached tamarins are omnivorous, frugivorous and insectivorous. Their diet mainly consists of fruits, nectar, gum exudates, invertebrates and small vertebrates. Invertebrates include katydids, stick grasshoppers, and spiders. Vertebrates include lizards and frogs. Gum feeding is seasonal, however it is a dietary staple during dry and early wet seasons when other resources are scarce. Exudates supplement nutrients and balance mineral intake; which prevent the species from experiencing a range of detrimental effects from a low-calcium and high-phosphorus insectivorous diet. They display a highly opportunistic foraging pattern, and the ratio and variety of their comestibles depend on the availability in their geographical location. Moustached tamarins select trees by the amount of nectar they yield, rather than proximity to their home range. This higher volume of nectar makes the chosen trees more reliable because it allows them to feed for longer periods. Their remarkable spatial memory allows them to quickly recall the location of fruiting trees. Spatial memory is vital because it aids in the exploitation of a widely scattered set of feeding sites and minimizes effort in foraging. == Ecological Role == The moustached tamarin monkey is a crucial seed disperser for many plant species as a result of their diverse diet. They spread the seeds of fruits they ingest, indirectly impacting forest regeneration and maintenance. They are opportunistic feeders, utilizing a wide range of plant resources, allowing them to disperse a variety of seed species, providing significant benefit to their ecosystem. == Group Dynamics == Group sizes are usually 4-8 individuals, excluding infants, and each group usually contains 1 or 2 adult females. However, groups have been observed to reach up to 15 individuals and solitary individuals have been encountered. Routinely, groups of moustached tamarins leave early in the morning to forage for food. They do not feed simultaneously. One of the adults positions themselves near the feeding site and scans the surroundings for predators to protect the group during mealtimes. They then retire at night in highly foliated areas to protect themselves from predators during slumber. === Territory === The home range of moustached tamarins is between 25 and 50 hectares . Moustached tamarins are territorial, however, they sometimes join with groups of brown- mantled tamarins (Saguinus fuscicollis) and Geoffroy's saddle-back tamarin (Leontocebus nigrifrons). These species can cohabit because they have varying locomotor types, hunting techniques, support preference, food selection, and reside in different strata of their forest habitat. The brown-mantled tamarin and the moustached tamarin do not compete for the same resources. Sharing territory with another species facilitates predator avoidance, increasing survival chances for both groups. Having more eyes and ears provides greater protection. === Conflict === There is often strife between neighboring groups of moustached tamarins due to limited food resources, especially near large feeding trees. Vocal battles can arise, with long calls that consist of short syllables at a high frequency. This type of conflict occurs between groups that are 25 meters or more apart . Fights can be more aggressive however, often including alarm calls, visual contact, scent marking and a series of chases and retreats. Adult males attack, inducing combative and loud vocalizations, while subadults chase one another. Subsequently, there is a period of calm, and both groups forage for food and subadults examine the opposing group for mating opportunities. The frequency of aggressive encounters increases during the breeding season and the majority of copulations occur during or directly after an aggressive encounter. == Communication == Communication is a vital part of everyday life for moustached tamarins. The different communication methods used are social grooming, scent marking, visual communication, and vocalizations. === Social Grooming === Social grooming can be used to develop bonds. The moustached tamarins use their claws to detangle and comb one another’s hair and remove parasites and dirt with their teeth and tongue. Social grooming is not equally exercised by members and the amount of grooming services given and received depends on the social position of the individual. === Scent Marking === Scent marking is used to identify territory boundaries and to communicate with others. Females practice scent marking more frequently than males because it is also used in mate selection. The three types of scent marking are circumanal marking, suprapubic marking and sternal marking. Circumanal marking is the most commonly used type of scent marking. === Visual Communication === Visual communication includes facial expressions, gestures, tonguing, and head- flicking. Tonguing is when a moustached tamarin moves its tongue across its lips. Head-flicking is when a moustached tamarin rapidly moves its head in an upward motion. Tonguing and head-flicking often co-occur and are used to communicate recognition, curiosity or anger. === Vocalizations === Vocalizations allow moustached tamarins to distinguish between individuals, organize group movements, and ensure all members are accounted for. If individuals become separated, individuals of the same group will produce 2 to 3 second long vocalizations to indicate their location. These calls consist of repeated short, frequency-modulated syllables ranging from 8 to 12 kilohertz. In the morning, moustached tamarins make calls to each other to coordinate movement for the day towards specific foraging sites. Young tamarins also make vocalizations while they run and chase each other during play. == Reproduction and Mating Habits == The reproduction season of the moustached tamarin monkey is November to March, during which the oldest female reproduces . Females go into oestrus for about 17 days. Their gestation period is about 145 days, after which females give birth. Other members of the group help to take care of the infants, allowing the female to give birth more than once a year. The eldest female frequently bears twins because they ovulate multiple ova during each reproductive cycle. The twins can be up to a quarter of the mother’s size at birth. Females reach reproductive maturity at about 480 days, and males at 540 days. Both sexes migrate to a different group in adulthood to avoid the risk of inbreeding. Moustached tamarins practice a variety of mating systems: polyandry, polygyny or polygynandry. The mothers often receive help from up to 4 or 5 other members of the group. In polyandrous groups, the alpha male tolerates the presence of other males who can provide infant-care. Not having enough helpers can sometimes lead to infanticide by the mother. == Population and Predation == The population trend for the moustached tamarin monkey is decreasing; however, the IUCN red list categorizes the moustache tamarin as least concerned. They have demonstrated an ability to adapt to disturbed habitats and proximity to human settlements. They can acclimate well to changes in environmental conditions and their ecosystem. Habitat destruction remains an inevitable threat to their population as for all species living in the Amazonian rainforest. However, their ability to adapt gives hope that this factor will not severely affect their population numbers. Moustached tamarin monkeys select densely foliated areas for resting and sleeping to best camouflage themselves because their small size makes them an easy target. Their main tactic is to avoid predation by attracting as little attention as possible. Their predators include eagles and other birds of prey, snakes, tayras, jaguarundis, ocelots and other wild cats. == Economic Importance == Moustached tamarin monkeys are economically significant because they are used extensively in biomedical research, like other tamarin species. They have been used in the development of the hepatitis A vaccine. == References == ==Further reading== * * * ==See Also== * * *Wikiproject Primates Category:Primates moustached tamarin Category:Callitrichidae Category:Mammals of Brazil Category:Mammals of Peru Category:Mammals of South America moustached tamarin Category:IUCN Red List least concern species ","title":"Moustached tamarin"},{"id":"3237331","text":"is a 2001 Japanese horror film directed by Kiyoshi Kurosawa. The film was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival. The movie was well-received critically and has a cult following. An American remake, also titled Pulse, debuted in 2006 and spawned two sequels. The script was also adapted into a novel of the same name by Kurosawa himself. ==Plot== The plot centers on ghosts invading the world of the living via the Internet. It features two parallel story lines. ===First story=== Kudo Michi (Kumiko Asō), an employee at a plant shop, has recently moved to Tokyo. Her co-workers include Sasano Junko, Toshio Yabe and Taguchi, who has been missing for some days working on a computer disk. Michi goes to Taguchi's apartment and finds him distracted and aloof; in the middle of their conversation, he casually makes a noose, leaves, and hangs himself. Michi and her friends inspect the disk he left behind and discover it contains an image of Taguchi staring at his own computer monitor, creating an endless series of images. In the other monitor on his desk, they discover a ghostly face staring out into Taguchi's room. Yabe receives a phone call of a distorted voice saying, \\"Help me.\\" Upon checking his phone, he sees the same image found on Taguchi's disk. He goes to Taguchi's apartment and sees a ghostly black stain on the wall where he hanged himself, as well as a paper with \\"The forbidden room\\" written on it. He notices a door sealed with red tape and enters, encountering a ghost. Yabe becomes depressed and tells Michi that he saw something horrible in \\"the forbidden room.\\" Michi receives a call like the one Yabe had received. She checks on Yabe and sees a black stain on the wall similar to Taguchi's one. She panics when she realizes Junko has unsealed and entered a red-taped door. Inside, she witnesses Junko being cornered by a ghost and rescues her. Junko becomes catatonic from the encounter. She later steps toward the wall and becomes a black stain. Worried, Michi goes to check on her mother and meets Ryosuke Kawashima. ===Second story=== Ryosuke, an economics student, has recently signed up to a new Internet Service Provider. His computer accesses a website by itself, showing him disturbing images of people alone in dark rooms, exhibiting bizarre behavior. That night, Ryosuke wakes up to find his computer on again with the disturbing images. He unplugs his computer in a panic. The next day, Harue Karasawa (Koyuki), a post-graduate computer science student, suggests he either bookmark the page or print the images for her to examine. Ryosuke attempts to do so, but finds that his computer will not follow his commands. Instead, a video plays of a man with his head in a plastic bag in a room with the words \\"HELP ME\\" written all over the walls. A classmate explains his theory that souls have begun to invade the physical world. Karasawa acts strange and suggests that ghosts would want to save humans from the loneliness of the afterlife. Ryosuke tries to escape with her to a faraway place using the subway. However, the train stops and Harue is seized by a desire to return home. Upon returning to her apartment, she claims that she is \\"not alone\\". When Ryosuke bursts in, she is gone. As more and more people begin to vanish, evacuations of Tokyo begin, and a full-scale invasion of the Kanto region by the ghosts is underway. Ryosuke meets Michi and they find Harue in an abandoned factory, where she shoots herself. When Ryosuke and Michi's car runs out of gas, Ryosuke enters a warehouse to search for fuel. He opens a door sealed with red tape and encounters a ghost who explains that \\"death was eternal loneliness.\\" Although he tries to resist the ghost's influence, Ryosuke loses the will to live, and Michi drags him to safety. They drive through a burning Tokyo, encountering apocalyptic scenery as well as a U.S. Army cargo plane that crashes from the sky. After locating a small motorboat, the pair are found and brought aboard a ship departing from Tokyo, crewed by a small group of survivors who tell them that similar events are happening all over the world. As the ship heads for Latin America, Ryosuke and Michi go below deck, where Ryosuke disintegrates into ashes. ==Cast== * Kumiko Asō as Michi Kudo * Haruhiko Kato as Ryosuke Kawashima * Koyuki as Harue Karasawa * Kurume Arisaka as Junko Sasano * Masatoshi Matsuo as Toshio Yabe * Shinji Takeda as Yoshizaki * Jun Fubuki as Michi's mother * Shun Sugata as Boss * Kōji Yakusho as Ship Captain * Show Aikawa as Employee * Kenji Mizuhashi as Taguchi ==Release== Pulse was first released in Japan on February 3, 2001, where it was distributed by Toho. Distant Horizon purchased worldwide distribution rights to the film from Daiei. The film premiered in the Un Certain Regard category at the Cannes Film Festival. ==Home video== The film was released on DVD by Magnolia Home Entertainment on February 21, 2006. Arrow Video has announced a Blu-ray release of the film for December 2016. As of October 2019, it is included as part of the subscription service run by the BFI. ==Critical reception== The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a rating of 74% based on 53 reviews, and a rating average of 6.8/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"A sinister spine-tingling techno-thriller whose artistry lies in the power of suggestion rather than a barrage of blood and guts or horror shop special effects.\\" AllMovie praised the film, writing \\"The first 30 minutes of Kairo is perhaps some of the most unnerving, frightening sequences to come down the pike in a long time.\\" Anita Gates of The New York Times wrote, \\"There are very few moments in Kiyoshi Kurosawa's fiercely original, thrillingly creepy horror movie that don't evoke a dreamlike dread of the truly unknown.\\" Slant Magazine gave the film four stars out of four, writing \\"Kurosawa's movies have a genuinely unnerving effect on the viewer because they deal with the kind of loneliness that exists in an overcrowded world. [...] Pulse is his strongest elucidation of this theme, treating the world wide web as a literal snare forging sinewy connections between strangers where the ultimate destination is chaos.\\" The Guardian called it \\"an incredibly creepy horror film\\" that, in the same way as Ring, \\"finds chills in the most dingy and mundane of locales; skillful deployment of grisly little moments and disturbing, cryptic imagery produce the requisite mood of dread and gloom.\\" Film Threat wrote, \\"What's worse than a horror film that frightens you sleepless is one that disturbs you to depression.\\" The Washington Post commented, \\"Pulse is best enjoyed if it's not questioned too closely. It lives visually in a way it cannot live intellectually\\". Entertainment Weekly was critical of the film, writing \\"Watching Pulse [...] you could almost die of anticipation\\", commenting that \\"nothing in the two snail-paced hours [...] makes close to a shred of sense\\". The Seattle Times criticized the film's storyline and length, writing \\"While it's rattling your nerves, Pulse leaves your brain wanting more\\", and The Village Voice called the film \\"at least half an hour too long\\". In 2012, Jaime N Christley of Slant magazine listed the film as one of the greatest of all time. In the early 2010s, Time Out conducted a poll with several authors, directors, actors and critics who have worked within the horror genre to vote for their top horror films. Pulse placed at number 65 on their top 100 list. ==See also== *List of ghost films ==References* * * Category:2001 horror films Category:Japanese films Category:Films based on horror novels Category:Films based on Japanese novels Category:Films directed by Kiyoshi Kurosawa Category:Japanese ghost films Category:Japanese horror films Category:2001 films ","title":"Pulse (2001 film)"},{"id":"3237334","text":"Empress Zhen (died 22 August 251), personal name unknown, formally known as Empress Huai (懷皇后), was an empress of the state of Cao Wei during the Three Kingdoms period of China.

She has since reported from every country in the Middle East. In November 2005, Gorani was one of the first television reporters on the ground in Amman, Jordan after Al Qaeda suicide bombers attacked two hotels. Earlier in 2005, she covered Israel's unilateral disengagement plan from Gaza. In the summer of 2006, she covered the 2006 Lebanon War from Lebanon, which earned CNN an Edward R. Murrow Award.CNN Anchors & Reporters - Hala Gorani In 2002 and in 2007, she led CNN's coverage of the respective French presidential elections. Gorani was one of the CNN journalists awarded a News and Documentary Emmy for the network's coverage of the 2011 Egyptian revolution that led to the ouster of the country's then president, Hosni Mubarak. In 2015, she covered from Paris the January Charlie Hebdo shooting and the November ISIS attacks. Gorani also covered the devastating 2010 Haiti earthquake, for which CNN's coverage was recognized with a Golden Nymph award, one of the highest honors in international journalism, at the Monte-Carlo Television Festival that year. In addition to her anchoring duties, Gorani often goes into the field to report on major breaking news stories. In late June, she was part of a small team of journalists allowed into Syria for the first time since the protests began to cover the situation there. She previously reported extensively from Jordan and Egypt, and her coverage of the Arab Spring helped CNN win a Peabody Award in 2012. In 2008, Gorani attended the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and she moderated the closing session that featured several business and political leaders including Tony Blair, Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Elie Wiesel and JP Morgan Chase & Co. Chairman and CEO James Dimon. Gorani formerly hosted Inside the Middle East on CNN International, the monthly show featuring stories on the most important social, political and cultural issues in the region. During her five years as host, she reported on several colorful and thought-provoking stories including poverty in oil-rich Bahrain; everyday struggles for artists living in Iraq; and gay life in the Middle East, which was a first on international television and earned a nomination for a Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) award.

In May 2015, Gorani was awarded an honorary doctorate by George Mason University and delivered the commencement address to that year's graduating students. On the weekend of 13–15 November 2015, Gorani was a principal member of the extensive CNN team that covered the action, aftermath and investigation of terrorist attacks in Paris, France where some 130 people were killed. In 2018, Gorani was nominated for another News and Documentary Emmy for Outstanding Breaking News Coverage, Manchester Concert Attack. That same year, she and her team received an Emmy Award for her show's coverage of \\"Syria: Gasping for Life in Khan Sheikhoun.\\" In a commencement address, Gorani offered these observations to the new graduates: Gorani says that as a journalist, career defining moments are those where one can identify that the work did make a difference; and the being different is a good thing because those differences will make a person memorable. Gorani advised the students to cultivate their differences and from them the students will find their strength. == Personal life == Gorani was born in 1970 in Seattle, Washington.

The third of five sons, Arthur Gook's father was a teacher. Gook distinguished himself as a student and won a university scholarship. His father, having taken up a new profession as an estate agent, would not allow him to attend a university. Instead, Gook was made to work in the family business. Later, he became personal secretary to a London publisher, and it was there he trained for the literary and publishing work he undertook later in life. Arther Gook was converted in a Bible class, and the Bible became his favourite book. He determined to reform his life and joined with the Open Brethren, which was a branch of the Plymouth Brethren religious sect. == Homeopathy == While working at the London Homeopathic Hospital, Gook received formal training as a homeopath. His wife, Florence Ethel Gook, received her training at the Missionary School of Homeopathy in London. Frederic H. Jones, a Scot, had started a mission in Iceland in 1897. Upon his death in 1905, Arthur and Florence Gook went to Iceland to carry on his work. They settled in Akureyri, which was the headquarters of his work for the next fifty years. It appears the Gooks supported their missionary work by being the first professionally trained homeopaths in Iceland. He is still commemorated as the founder of Homeopathy in Iceland. == Radio broadcasting == Gook built a private radio station and started gospel broadcasts, a unique achievement in his time. Saemundur later became an influential radio voice in the religious program of the Icelandic national radio. The start of the UK Gospel Recordings centre occurred when Arthur Gook heard of the work of Gospel Recordings. He was forward looking and probably the first Christian to get the vision for using radio to spread the Gospel. He built the first ever Christian radio station, but was unable to continue its operation, due to the government refusing to issue a licence to broadcast. He immediately saw the way he could use the records in Iceland and contacted Gospel Recordings in the United States and work for the commencement of a British branch. Faced with the technical problems of making the Icelandic recordings, he turned to Eric Hogg, an electronic engineer who, as a young man of 20, had built the radio station for him. Eric Hogg, who was involved in the Missionary Technical Fellowship (who provided technical support to serving missionaries) also caught the vision of Gospel Recordings. He invited Joy Ridderhof to England in 1955 and arranged meetings and a press conference in London. It was during this time that the UK headquarters was established. Rev George Scott, then Home Director of China Inland Mission was the first Chairman. Scott, along with Eric Hogg and Gilbert Vinden, became the first members of the UK Council of Gospel Recordings, at one time the publishers of the largest amount of 45rpm records. == Author == Gook wrote a number of books, both in English and in Icelandic. His book Can a Young Man Trust His Bible? was translated into many languages, and during a world tour in 1950–1951, he found that his work had preceded him. His other books include: * Can a young man find the path?, London: Pickering & Inglis, 1958. * Can a young man overcome?, London: Pickering & Inglis, [n.d]. * Can a young man trust his God?, London: Pickering & Inglis, [n.d.]. * Can a young man trust his Saviour?, London: Pickering & Inglis, [n.d.]. * Fighting with beasts: a chat with young Christians, London: Pickering & Inglis, [n.d.]. * Which has won: Modernism or the Bible?, London: Pickering & Inglis, 1937. Among his literary achievements was the translation of Arthur T Pierson's biography of George Müller (unabridged) into Icelandic. Gook started the Christian periodical Nórdurljósid, translated The Northern Light. The Lowe Continental Brethren donated funds in its early days with the finance of this magazine. Gook was assisted by the Icelandic schoolteacher, Saemundur Johannesson, who continued the periodical for more than 25 years. Saemundur wrote or translated from English most of its contents. Nórdurljósið was widely distributed, but when Saemundur died, it ceased circulation. == Poet == Arthur was a man of poetic taste and greatly admired the Hymns of the Passion by Rev Hallgrímur Pétursson. Although an earlier English translation of the hymns had been made in 1913, Gook was not satisfied. When he returned to England in 1955, due to poor health, he began a new translation of Pétursson's Passion Hymns into English. As far as possible, he kept to the metrical form of the original. His literary taste, his poetic mind, his musical ear, his knowledge of the Bible, and his spiritual affinity with the Rev Pétursson, suited him for this task. Gook died in 1959, with the translation still incomplete. A few alterations were made after his death. Gook's translation of Rev Pétursson's Hymns of the Passion was published in 1966 by Hallgrímskirkja, under the imprimatur of the Bishop of Iceland. While Gook's English translation of the hymns is the most widely available edition, his Plymouth Brethren theology replaced the Lutheran theology found in Pétursson's original text, and is therefore not considered the authoritative and preferred translation.

The heel is up for the back leg. The back leg crosses the front leg. A young girl presenting flowers to Queen Elizabeth II outside Brisbane City Hall in March, 1954. A curtsy (also spelled curtsey or incorrectly as courtsey) is a traditional gesture of greeting, in which a girl or woman bends her knees while bowing her head. It is the female equivalent of male bowing or genuflecting in Western cultures. Miss Manners characterizes its knee bend as deriving from a \\"traditional gesture of an inferior to a superior.\\" The word \\"curtsy\\" is a phonological change from \\"courtesy\\" known in linguistics as syncope. ==Overview== According to Desmond Morris, the motions involved in the curtsy and the bow were similar until the 17th century, and the gender differentiation between the actions developed afterwards. The earlier, combined version is still performed by Restoration comedy actors. In more formal variants of the curtsy, the girl/woman bends the knees outward (rather than straight ahead), often sweeping one foot behind her. She may also use her hands to hold her skirt out from her body. In the Victorian era, when women wore floor-length, hooped skirts, they curtsied using the plié movement borrowed from second-position in classical ballet in which the knees are bent while the back is held straight. Both feet and knees point out so the torso lowers straight down. This way, the lady lowers herself evenly and not to one side. Traditionally, women and girls curtsy for those of senior social rank just as men and boys bow. Today this practice has become less common. In many European cultures it is traditional for women to curtsy in front of royalty. It may then be referred to as a court curtsy and is often especially deep and elaborate. Further, some female domestic workers curtsy for their employers. Female dancers often curtsy at the end of a performance to show gratitude or to acknowledge applause from the audience. At the end of a ballet class, students will also curtsy or bow to the teacher and pianist to show gratitude. According to Victorian dance etiquette, a woman curtsies before beginning a dance. Female Scottish highland dancers performing the national dances and the Irish jig also curtsy (at both the beginning and end for the national dances and at the end for the Irish jig). Some female ballroom dancers will curtsy to their partners before beginning the Viennese Waltz. In victorian courts, the curtsy was done as a signal for courtship availability, and social status dominance or submissiveness, in order to be successful socially.About the Pavane  Arts in the Renaissance, www.pbslearningmedia.org In this video (~2:00) Carrie Nath, director of education for the Kentucky Arts Council, explains the purpose and form of the Pavane, an Elizabethan processional dance. It is customary for female figure skaters to curtsy at the end of their performances at figure skating competitions or shows. It is also acceptable in some cultures for the female to curtsy if wearing trousers or shorts. During her coronation, Queen Elizabeth II performed a curtsy, or rather a half- curtsy, half-neck bow to King Edward's Chair. The \\"Texas dip\\" is an extreme curtsy performed by a Texan debutante. The young woman slowly lowers her forehead towards the floor by crossing her ankles, then bending her knees and sinking. The escort's hand is held during the dip. When the debutante's head nears the floor, she turns her head sideways, averting the risk of soiling her dress with lipstick. ==See also== * Partial squat ==References== ==External links== *The Lady's Courtesy in the Victorian Ballroom Category:Dance moves Category:Gestures Category:Gestures of respect Category:Bowing Category:Partial squatting position ","title":"Curtsy"},{"id":"3237381","text":"ASAP usually stands for \\"as soon as possible\\".

Optimal foraging theory predicts that this bee will forage in a way that will maximize its hive's net yield of energy. Optimal foraging theory (OFT) is a behavioral ecology model that helps predict how an animal behaves when searching for food. Although obtaining food provides the animal with energy, searching for and capturing the food require both energy and time. To maximize fitness, an animal adopts a foraging strategy that provides the most benefit (energy) for the lowest cost, maximizing the net energy gained. OFT helps predict the best strategy that an animal can use to achieve this goal. OFT is an ecological application of the optimality model. This theory assumes that the most economically advantageous foraging pattern will be selected for in a species through natural selection. When using OFT to model foraging behavior, organisms are said to be maximizing a variable known as the currency, such as the most food per unit time. In addition, the constraints of the environment are other variables that must be considered. Constraints are defined as factors that can limit the forager's ability to maximize the currency. The optimal decision rule, or the organism's best foraging strategy, is defined as the decision that maximizes the currency under the constraints of the environment. Identifying the optimal decision rule is the primary goal of the OFT.Sinervo, Barry (1997). \\"Optimal Foraging Theory: Constraints and Cognitive Processes\\" , pp. 105–130 in Behavioral Ecology. University of California, Santa Cruz. ==Building an optimal foraging model== An optimal foraging model generates quantitative predictions of how animals maximize their fitness while they forage. The model building process involves identifying the currency, constraints, and appropriate decision rule for the forager.Stephens, D. W. and Krebs, J. R. (1986) \\"Foraging Theory\\". 1st ed. Monographs in Behavior and Ecology. Princeton University Press. . Currency is defined as the unit that is optimized by the animal. It is also a hypothesis of the costs and benefits that are imposed on that animal.Krebs, J. R. and Davies, N. B. (1989) An Introduction to Behavioral Ecology. 4th ed. Oxford: Blackwell Scientific Publications. For example, a certain forager gains energy from food, but incurs the cost of searching for the food: the time and energy spent searching could have been used instead on other endeavors, such as finding mates or protecting young. It would be in the animal's best interest to maximize its benefits at the lowest cost. Thus, the currency in this situation could be defined as net energy gain per unit time. However, for a different forager, the time it takes to digest the food after eating could be a more significant cost than the time and energy spent looking for food. In this case, the currency could be defined as net energy gain per digestive turnover time instead of net energy gain per unit time. Furthermore, benefits and costs can depend on a forager's community. For example, a forager living in a hive would most likely forage in a manner that would maximize efficiency for its colony rather than itself. By identifying the currency, one can construct a hypothesis about which benefits and costs are important to the forager in question. Constraints are hypotheses about the limitations that are placed on an animal. These limitations can be due to features of the environment or the physiology of the animal and could limit their foraging efficiency. The time that it takes for the forager to travel from the nesting site to the foraging site is an example of a constraint. The maximum number of food items a forager is able to carry back to its nesting site is another example of a constraint. There could also be cognitive constraints on animals, such as limits to learning and memory. The more constraints that one is able to identify in a given system, the more predictive power the model will have. Figure 1. Energy gain per cost (E) for adopting foraging strategy x. Adapted from Parker & Smith. Given the hypotheses about the currency and the constraints, the optimal decision rule is the model's prediction of what the animal's best foraging strategy should be. Possible examples of optimal decision rules could be the optimal number of food items that an animal should carry back to its nesting site or the optimal size of a food item that an animal should feed on. Figure 1, shows an example of how an optimal decision rule could be determined from a graphical model. The curve represents the energy gain per cost (E) for adopting foraging strategy x. Energy gain per cost is the currency being optimized. The constraints of the system determine the shape of this curve. The optimal decision rule (x*) is the strategy for which the currency, energy gain per costs, is the greatest. Optimal foraging models can look very different and become very complex, depending on the nature of the currency and the number of constraints considered. However, the general principles of currency, constraints, and optimal decision rule remain the same for all models. To test a model, one can compare the predicted strategy to the animal's actual foraging behavior. If the model fits the observed data well, then the hypotheses about the currency and constraints are supported. If the model doesn't fit the data well, then it is possible that either the currency or a particular constraint has been incorrectly identified. ==Different feeding systems and classes of predators== Optimal foraging theory is widely applicable to feeding systems throughout the animal kingdom. Under the OFT, any organism of interest can be viewed as a predator that forages prey. There are different classes of predators that organisms fall into and each class has distinct foraging and predation strategies. * True predators attack large numbers of prey throughout their life. They kill their prey either immediately or shortly after the attack. They may eat all or only part of their prey. True predators include tigers, lions, whales, sharks, seed-eating birds, ants. * Grazers eat only a portion of their prey. They harm the prey, but rarely kill it. Grazers include antelope, cattle, and mosquitoes. * Parasites, like grazers, eat only a part of their prey (host), but rarely the entire organism. They spend all or large portions of their life cycle living in/on a single host. This intimate relationship is typical of tapeworms, liver flukes, and plant parasites, such as the potato blight. * Parasitoids are mainly typical of wasps (order Hymenoptera), and some flies (order Diptera). Eggs are laid inside the larvae of other arthropods which hatch and consume the host from the inside, killing it. This unusual predator–host relationship is typical of about 10% of all insects.Godfray, H. C. J. (1994) Parasitoids: Behavioral and Evolutionary Ecology. Princeton University Press, Princeton. Many viruses that attack single-celled organisms (such as bacteriophages) are also parasitoids; they reproduce inside a single host that is inevitably killed by the association. The optimization of these different foraging and predation strategies can be explained by the optimal foraging theory. In each case, there are costs, benefits, and limitations that ultimately determine the optimal decision rule that the predator should follow. ==The optimal diet model== One classical version of the optimal foraging theory is the optimal diet model, which is also known as the prey choice model or the contingency model. In this model, the predator encounters different prey items and decides whether to eat what it has or search for a more profitable prey item. The model predicts that foragers should ignore low profitability prey items when more profitable items are present and abundant.Stephens, D.W., Brown, J.S., and Ydenberg, R.C. (2007). Foraging: Behavior and Ecology. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. The profitability of a prey item is dependent on several ecological variables. E is the amount of energy (calories) that a prey item provides the predator. Handling time (h) is the amount of time it takes the predator to handle the food, beginning from the time the predator finds the prey item to the time the prey item is eaten. The profitability of a prey item is then defined as E/h. Additionally, search time (S) is the amount of time it takes the predator to find a prey item and is dependent on the abundance of the food and the ease of locating it. In this model, the currency is energy intake per unit time and the constraints include the actual values of E, h, and S, as well as the fact that prey items are encountered sequentially. ===Model of choice between big and small prey=== Using these variables, the optimal diet model can predict how predators choose between two prey types: big prey1 with energy value E1 and handling time h1, and small prey2 with energy value E2 and handling time h2. In order to maximize its overall rate of energy gain, a predator must consider the profitability of the two prey types. If it is assumed that big prey1 is more profitable than small prey2, then E1/h1 > E2/h2. Thus, if the predator encounters prey1, it should always choose to eat it, because of its higher profitability. It should never bother to go searching for prey2. However, if the animal encounters prey2, it should reject it to look for a more profitable prey1, unless the time it would take to find prey1 is too long and costly for it to be worth it. Thus, the animal should eat prey2 only if E2/h2 > E1/(h1+S1), where S1 is the search time for prey1. Since it is always favorable to choose to eat prey1, the choice to eat prey1 is not dependent on the abundance of prey2. But since the length of S1 (i.e. how difficult it is to find prey1) is logically dependent on the density of prey1, the choice to eat prey2 is dependent on the abundance of prey1. ===Generalist and specialist diets=== The optimal diet model also predicts that different types of animals should adopt different diets based on variations in search time. This idea is an extension of the model of prey choice that was discussed above. The equation, E2/h2 > E1/(h1+S1), can be rearranged to give: S1 > [(E1h2)/E2] – h1. This rearranged form gives the threshold for how long S1 must be for an animal to choose to eat both prey1 and prey2. Animals that have S1's that reach the threshold are defined as generalists. In nature, generalists include a wide range of prey items in their diet. An example of a generalist is a mouse, which consumes a large variety of seeds, grains, and nuts. In contrast, predators with relatively short S1's are still better off choosing to eat only prey1. These types of animals are defined as specialists and have very exclusive diets in nature. An example of a specialist is the koala, which solely consumes eucalyptus leaves. In general, different animals across the four functional classes of predators exhibit strategies ranging across a continuum between being a generalist and a specialist. Additionally, since the choice to eat prey2 is dependent on the abundance of prey1 (as discussed earlier), if prey1 becomes so scarce that S1 reaches the threshold, then the animal should switch from exclusively eating prey1 to eating both prey1 and prey2. In other words, if the food within a specialist's diet becomes very scarce, a specialist can sometimes switch to being a generalist. ===Functional response curves=== As previously mentioned, the amount of time it takes to search for a prey item depends on the density of the prey. Functional response curves show the rate of prey capture as a function of food density and can be used in conjunction with the optimal diet theory to predict foraging behavior of predators. There are three different types of functional response curves.Staddon, J.E.R. \\"Foraging and Behavioral Ecology.\\" Adaptive Behavior and Learning. First Edition ed. Cambridge UP, 1983. Figure 2. Three types of functional response curves. Adapted from Staddon. For a Type I functional response curve, the rate of prey capture increases linearly with food density. At low prey densities, the search time is long. Since the predator spends most of its time searching, it eats every prey item it finds. As prey density increases, the predator is able to capture the prey faster and faster. At a certain point, the rate of prey capture is so high, that the predator doesn't have to eat every prey item it encounters. After this point, the predator should choose only the prey items with the highest E/h. For a Type II functional response curve, the rate of prey capture negatively accelerates as it increases with food density. This is because it assumes that the predator is limited by its capacity to process food. In other words, as the food density increases, handling time increases. At the beginning of the curve, rate of prey capture increases nearly linearly with prey density and there is almost no handling time. As prey density increases, the predator spends less and less time searching for prey and more and more time handling the prey. The rate of prey capture increases less and less, until it finally plateaus. The high number of prey basically \\"swamps\\" the predator. A Type III functional response curve is a sigmoid curve. The rate of prey capture increases at first with prey density at a positively accelerated rate, but then at high densities changes to the negatively accelerated form, similar to that of the Type II curve. At high prey densities (the top of the curve), each new prey item is caught almost immediately. The predator is able to be choosy and doesn't eat every item it finds. So, assuming that there are two prey types with different profitabilities that are both at high abundance, the predator will choose the item with the higher E/h. However, at low prey densities (the bottom of the curve) the rate of prey capture increases faster than linearly. This means that as the predator feeds and the prey type with the higher E/h becomes less abundant, the predator will start to switch its preference to the prey type with the lower E/h, because that type will be relatively more abundant. This phenomenon is known as prey switching. ===Predator–prey interaction=== Predator–prey coevolution often makes it unfavorable for a predator to consume certain prey items, since many anti-predator defenses increase handling time. Examples include porcupine quills, the palatability and digestibility of the poison dart frog, crypsis, and other predator avoidance behaviors. In addition, because toxins may be present in many prey types, predators include a lot of variability in their diets to prevent any one toxin from reaching dangerous levels. Thus, it is possible that an approach focusing only on energy intake may not fully explain an animal's foraging behavior in these situations. ==The marginal value theorem and optimal foraging== Figure 3. Marginal value theorem shown graphically. The marginal value theorem is a type of optimality model that is often applied to optimal foraging. This theorem is used to describe a situation in which an organism searching for food in a patch must decide when it is economically favorable to leave. While the animal is within a patch, it experiences the law of diminishing returns, where it becomes harder and harder to find prey as time goes on. This may be because the prey is being depleted, the prey begins to take evasive action and becomes harder to catch, or the predator starts crossing its own path more as it searches. This law of diminishing returns can be shown as a curve of energy gain per time spent in a patch (Figure 3). The curve starts off with a steep slope and gradually levels off as prey becomes harder to find. Another important cost to consider is the traveling time between different patches and the nesting site. An animal loses foraging time while it travels and expends energy through its locomotion. In this model, the currency being optimized is usually net energy gain per unit time. The constraints are the travel time and the shape of the curve of diminishing returns. Graphically, the currency (net energy gain per unit time) is given by the slope of a diagonal line that starts at the beginning of traveling time and intersects the curve of diminishing returns (Figure 3). In order to maximize the currency, one wants the line with the greatest slope that still touches the curve (the tangent line). The place that this line touches the curve provides the optimal decision rule of the amount of time that the animal should spend in a patch before leaving. ==Examples of optimal foraging models in animals== Figure 4. Right-shifted mussel profitability curve. Adapted from Meire & Ervynck. ===Optimal foraging of oystercatchers=== Oystercatcher mussel feeding provides an example of how the optimal diet model can be utilized. Oystercatchers forage on mussels and crack them open with their bills. The constraints on these birds are the characteristics of the different mussel sizes. While large mussels provide more energy than small mussels, large mussels are harder to crack open due to their thicker shells. This means that while large mussels have a higher energy content (E), they also have a longer handling time (h). The profitability of any mussel is calculated as E/h. The oystercatchers must decide which mussel size will provide enough nutrition to outweigh the cost and energy required to open it. In their study, Meire and Ervynck tried to model this decision by graphing the relative profitabilities of different sized mussels. They came up with a bell-shaped curve, indicating that moderately sized mussels were the most profitable. However, they observed that if an oystercatcher rejected too many small mussels, the time it took to search for the next suitable mussel greatly increased. This observation shifted their bell-curve to the right (Figure 4). However, while this model predicted that oystercatchers should prefer mussels of 50–55 mm, the observed data showed that oystercatchers actually prefer mussels of 30–45 mm. Meire and Ervynk then realized the preference of mussel size did not depend only on the profitability of the prey, but also on the prey density. After this was accounted for, they found a good agreement between the model's prediction and the observed data. ===Optimal foraging in starlings=== Figure 5. If starlings are maximizing net rate of energy gain, longer traveling time results in larger optimum load. Adapted from Krebs and Davies. The foraging behavior of the European starling, Sturnus vulgaris, provides an example of how marginal value theorem is used to model optimal foraging. Starlings leave their nests and travel to food patches in search for larval leatherjackets to bring back to their young. The starlings must determine the optimal number of prey items to take back in one trip (i.e. the optimal load size). While the starlings forage within a patch, they experience diminishing returns: the starling is able to hold only so many leatherjackets in its bill, so the speed with which the parent picks up larvae decreases with the number of larvae that it already has in its bill. Thus, the constraints are the shape of the curve of diminishing returns and the travel time (the time it takes to make a round trip from the nest to a patch and back). In addition, the currency is hypothesized to be net energy gain per unit time. Using this currency and the constraints, the optimal load can be predicted by drawing a line tangent to the curve of diminishing returns, as discussed previously (Figure 3). Kacelnik et al. wanted to determine if this species does indeed optimize net energy gain per unit time as hypothesized. They designed an experiment in which the starlings were trained to collect mealworms from an artificial feeder at different distances from the nest. The researchers artificially generated a fixed curve of diminishing returns for the birds by dropping mealworms at successively longer and longer intervals. The birds continued to collect mealworms as they were presented, until they reached an \\"optimal\\" load and flew home. As Figure 5 shows, if the starlings were maximizing net energy gain per unit time, a short travel time would predict a small optimal load and a long travel time would predict a larger optimal load. In agreement with these predictions, Kacelnik found that the longer the distance between the nest and the artificial feeder, the larger the load size. In addition, the observed load sizes quantitatively corresponded very closely to the model's predictions. Other models based on different currencies, such as energy gained per energy spent (i.e. energy efficiency), failed to predict the observed load sizes as accurately. Thus, Kacelnik concluded that starlings maximize net energy gain per unit time. This conclusion was not disproved in later experiments. ===Optimal foraging in bees=== Worker bees provide another example of the use of marginal value theorem in modeling optimal foraging behavior. Bees forage from flower to flower collecting nectar to carry back to the hive. While this situation is similar to that of the starlings, both the constraints and currency are actually different for the bees. A bee does not experience diminishing returns because of nectar depletion or any other characteristic of the flowers themselves. The total amount of nectar foraged increases linearly with time spent in a patch. However, the weight of the nectar adds a significant cost to the bee's flight between flowers and its trip back to the hive. Wolf and Schmid-Hempel showed, by experimentally placing varying weights on the backs of bees, that the cost of heavy nectar is so great that it shortens the bees' lifespan. The shorter the lifespan of a worker bee, the less overall time it has to contribute to its colony. Thus, there is a curve of diminishing returns for the net yield of energy that the hive receives as the bee gathers more nectar during one trip. The cost of heavy nectar also impacts the currency used by the bees. Unlike the starlings in the previous example, bees maximize energy efficiency (energy gained per energy spent) rather than net rate of energy gain (net energy gained per time). This is because the optimal load predicted by maximizing net rate of energy gain is too heavy for the bees and shortens their lifespan, decreasing their overall productivity for the hive, as explained earlier. By maximizing energy efficiency, the bees are able to avoid expending too much energy per trip and are able to live long enough to maximize their lifetime productivity for their hive. In a different paper, Schmid-Hempel showed that the observed relationship between load size and flight time is well correlated with the predictions based on maximizing energy efficiency, but very poorly correlated with the predictions based on maximizing net rate of energy gain. ===Optimal foraging in Centrarchid Fishes=== The nature of prey selection by two centrarchids (white crappie and bluegill) has been presented as a model incorporating optimal foraging strategies by Manatunge & Asaeda . The visual field of the foraging fish as represented by the reactive distance was analysed in detail to estimate the number of prey encounters per search bout. The predicted reactive distances were compared with experimental data. The energetic cost associated with fish foraging behaviour was calculated based on the sequence of events that takes place for each prey consumed. Comparisons of the relative abundance of prey species and size categories in the stomach to the lake environment indicated that both white crappie and bluegill (length < 100 mm) strongly select prey utilizing an energy optimization strategy. In most cases, the fish exclusively selected large Daphnia ignoring evasive prey types (Cyclops, Diaptomids) and small cladocera. This selectivity is the result of fish actively avoiding prey with high evasion capabilities even though they appear to be high in energetic content and having translated this into optimal selectivity through capture success rates. The energy consideration and visual system, apart from the forager's ability to capture prey, are the major determinants of prey selectivity for large-sized bluegill and white crappie still at planktivorous stages. ==Criticism and limitations of the optimal foraging theory== Although many studies, such as the ones cited in the examples above, provide quantitative support for optimal foraging theory and demonstrate its usefulness, the model has received criticism regarding its validity and limitations. First, optimal foraging theory relies on the assumption that natural selection will optimize foraging strategies of organisms. However, natural selection is not an all-powerful force that produces perfect designs, but rather a passive process of selection for genetically-based traits that increase organisms' reproductive success. Given that genetics involves interactions between loci, recombination, and other complexities, there is no guarantee that natural selection can optimize a specific behavioral parameter.Gray, Russell D. \\"Faith and Foraging: A Critique of the \\"Paradigm Argument from Design\\"\\" p. 198 in Foraging Behavior. Ed. Alan C. Kamil, John R. Krebs, and H. Robald Pulliam. New York, N.Y.: Plenum In addition, OFT also assumes that foraging behaviors are able to be freely shaped by natural selection, because these behaviors are independent from other activities of the organism. However, given that organisms are integrated systems, rather than mechanical aggregates of parts, this is not always the case. For example, the need to avoid predators may constrain foragers to feed less than the optimal rate. Thus, an organism's foraging behaviors may not be optimized as OFT would predict, because they are not independent from other behaviors. Another limitation of OFT is that it lacks precision in practice. In theory, an optimal foraging model gives researchers specific, quantitative predictions about a predator's optimal decision rule based on the hypotheses about the currency and constraints of the system. However, in reality, it is difficult to define basic concepts like prey type, encounter rates, or even a patch as the forager perceives them. Thus, while the variables of OFT can seem consistent theoretically, in practice, they can be arbitrary and difficult to measure. Furthermore, although the premise of OFT is to maximize an organism's fitness, many studies show only correlations between observed and predicted foraging behavior and stop short of testing whether the animal's behavior actually increases its reproductive fitness. It is possible that in certain cases, there is no correlation between foraging returns and reproductive success at all. Without accounting for this possibility, many studies using the OFT remain incomplete and fail to address and test the main point of the theory. One of the most imperative critiques of OFT is that it may not be truly testable. This issue arises whenever there is a discrepancy between the model's predictions and the actual observations. It is difficult to tell whether the model is fundamentally wrong or whether a specific variable has been inaccurately identified or left out. Because it is possible to add endless plausible modifications to the model, the model of optimality may never be rejected. This creates the problem of researchers shaping their model to fit their observations, rather than rigorously testing their hypotheses about the animal's foraging behavior. ==References== ==Further reading== * Optimal Foraging Theory by Barry Sinervo (1997), Course: \\"Behavioral Ecology 2013\\", Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, UCSC – This Section, of that Course at UCSC, considers OFT and 'Adaptational Hypotheses' ('guided trial and error, instinct'). along with addition subjects such as \\"Prey Size\\", \\"Patch Residence Time\\", \\"Patch Quality and Competitors\\", \\"Search Strategies\\", \\"Risk Aversive Behavior\\" and foraging practices subject to \\"Food Limitation\\".

New definitions from February 28, 2013 placed the population at 363,000. ==History== East Lynn began as a small merchant community known as Twin Creek but eventually grew as a coal town. In 1868, the Adkins Mills Post Office was established and the community was known as Adkins Mills. The Big Sandy, East Lynn & Guyan Railroad was formed in 1903 and merged with the Norfolk and Western in 1908. Also in 1908, East Lynn was incorporated. East Lynn continued to grow in the 1910s and at various times had three movie theaters, doctors, lawyers, and a detective agency. In the late 1910s, the residents decided to abandon the town's charter, and the town became unincorporated once again. Much of the town was destroyed by fire in November 1919. East Lynn was rebuilt; however, it burned once again in February 1955. The coal mines shut down in the 1960s, and the railroad left, leaving the town dilapidated. The East Lynn Lake was created in the 1960s by the Army Corps of Engineers. Rockspring Development reopened a mine near East Lynn on Camp Creek, but it has not created any new growth for the town itself. ==Demographics== East Lynn is a part of the Huntington-Ashland, WV-KY-OH, Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA).

Taking the shape of an abstract tripod figure, the iZ allows users to interactively manipulate music by twisting particular parts of the figure's body as well as add sound effects to prerecorded sound from a connected audio device. The toy also acts as a dancing speaker. Since its release it has been available in 5 color schemes, green/orange, dark blue/light blue, red/yellow, purple/green, and chrome/orange. iZ was developed by Roger Shiffman, who also created the Giga Pets, Furby and Poo-Chi toys. It was explicitly said during the development phase that a \\"new Furby\\" was the aim. iZ is designed to seem like it has a life of its own and does things out of its user's control when there is interaction with it. ==Modes of operation== Since the iZ is such an abstract kind of toy the easiest way to understand it is by learning what you can do with it. The iZ has a few methods for input. First, as mentioned, it has an audio jack to connect other audio devices. It has two ears that are twistable and a touch-sensitive tentacle, called a flicker, on its head. On top of this it also has five buttons placed on different places on its colorful belly. All the input methods except the audio jack are colored in a secondary color to raise its affordance. The iZ's three legs are also adjustable, but these do not generate any input. For output the iZ has a built in speaker, a nose that lights up in different colors and two eyes driven by small motors making them able to move up and down. When another audio device is connected to the iZ it acts as a speaker but also overlays some of its own sound effects on top of the sound from the audio device. When overlaying its own sound effects it also moves its eyes and lights up its nose. By pressing the left side of iZ belly the sound effects will be turned off and iZ will only act as a regular speaker. When no other audio device is connected iZ has three modes of operation; Play, DJ and WZIZ FM. In Play mode, which is the startup mode, iZ lets you compose your own music by manipulating his inputs. Each ear corresponds to one audio track, the belly controls the drum track and tempo, and the flicker can be hit for iZ to generate sound effects. iZ randomly adds his own flavour to the track by overlaying witty comments or radio noise. When in DJ mode iZ evolves the track himself by changing one feature of the track at a time. If the user doesn't like the current music iZ outputs, the belly can be pressed to force iZ to instantly make a change. No interaction is allowed in this mode, so when the user tries any input which will change the track a simple sound is played to indicate that it registered the input but won't react to it. As stated in iZ's manual \\"Although he is not a radio, he thinks he is\\". In WZIZ FM mode, iZ creates a completely new track every time it makes a change and inserts a noise to simulate the tuning of radio stations between the tracks. If you adjust the ears, which are supposed to be the antenna, you make iZ create a new random track instantly. ==iZ Cartoon== Zizzle and DIC Entertainment created a direct-to-video iZ cartoon, iZ and the Zizzles in 2007. The trailer could be viewed on the Zizzle website. 2 episodes were made, being the pilot and a second episode, \\"Will the Zizzles Sizzle or Fizzle?\\". ==References== ==External links== * Zizzle's iZ website *Available archived version of Product's Website * Category:Toy brands Category:2000s toys Category:Products introduced in 2005 ","title":"IZ (toy)"},{"id":"3237436","text":"Themselves, previously known as Them, is an American hip hop duo based in Oakland, California.

He was also a poet. His poems represent his personality, spirituality and belief. ==Biography== Ahmed Al-Waeli was born in September, 1928 in Najaf, Iraq. He came from a very well cultured family. His father (Sheikh Hassoun Al-Waeli) was also a religious cleric and a poet. However, he did not become as famous as his son Ahmed. From his youth, Ahmed Al-Waeli was smart and ambitious. He studied and memorized the Qur'an when he was seven years old. He graduated with an honor degree in 1962 in Arabic language and Islamic Jurisprudence. Then, he pursued his education in the institute of higher education –one of the institutes of university of Baghdad- and finished his master's degree in the same subject. The title of his thesis is “Custody Rules in Sharia and Law” which was published as a book later. He then left Iraq and went to Egypt to pursue his doctorate education. He received his PhD in economics in 1972 and his dissertation discusses the Islamic view of exploitation of labor. As Najaf is famous with Shiite Islamic religious schools and Arabic literature, Al- Waeli studied under prominent religious figures. He learned lecturing through a group of Islamic lecturers including Sayyid Baqir Slaimoun. He gained great admiration from his teachers through his intelligence, articulation, and presentation style. Ayatollah Imam Khomeini called him “the Islamic Library” as he was spreading his rich knowledge as well as lecturing the philosophy of Islamic jurisprudences in different places. Likewise, Grand Ayatollah Abul- Qassim Khoei called him \\"the Tongue of Shia\\" as his voice represents Shia ideology. One of his common messages in his lectures is that the differences between Shia and Sunnah jurisprudences should not create tension between the two sects since both sects ultimately have the same goal (which is getting closer to Allah). He repeatedly conveys that each sect has his own Ijtihad (interpretation of Hadith) but that should not create tension. He always condemned those whom called Shia non-Muslims. Al-Waeli died in Baghdad on July 14, 2003 in his homeland after 24 years in exile. Thousands of people gathered in his funeral in the city of Najaf to express their sorrow and sympathy for his departure. ==Presentation style== Al-Waeli has become famous with his presentation and lecturing style. In fact, his lecturing style (or school) is now known as “Al-Waeli’s School of Lecturing.” The main characteristics of this school are: 1\\\\. Topic Focus: this is the most important characteristic in this school. Unlike other Islamic lecturers, Al-Waeli concentrates only on one subject in each lecture and does not branch out to different subjects. The purpose of this is to avoid confusing and losing the audience’s attention, and to provide enough details to cover the subject. This is not an easy task. In fact, it requires a big effort from the lecturer to study the subject thoroughly before lecturing to make sure that all aspects of the topic are covered. Besides, he starts his presentation with a short statement that describes the focus of his lecture. This statement is usually a verse from the Qur'an. 2\\\\. Courage and Sincerity: His confidence and knowledge gave him the courage to speak the truth and defend his school of thought. 3\\\\. Audience Evaluation: Al-Waeli has the ability to evaluate his audience before lecturing. This ability simplified the choice and depth of the topic he would present. Also, through this ability, he gained the audience’s attention and interest. 4\\\\. Voice Pitch: Al-Waeli’s vocal quality helped him articulate his speech. 5\\\\. High Morals: Al-Waeli is known for his high morals and virtues which developed his charisma and power of persuasion. ==Books== Al-Waeli wrote several books including: * The Essence of Shiism * Custody Rules in Sharia and Law * Islamic View of Exploitation of Labor * The Defense of Truth * My Experience with Husayni Pulpit * Toward a Scientific Interpretation of Qur'an ==External links== *http://www.ahmedalwaeli.com/ * http://www.Al-Waeli.com/ * http://www.alwaeli.org/ * http://www.kerbalaya.net/hashemya5/a1a/indexa1a.htm * http://www.shiaweb.org/v2/sounds/viewcat_72.html Category:1928 births Category:2003 deaths Category:Iraqi Shia clerics Category:People from Najaf Category:Iraqi Shia Muslims Category:Twelvers ","title":"Ahmed Al-Waeli"},{"id":"3237452","text":"Alber Elbaz (, born 6 February 1961) is an Israeli fashion designer.

LeConte is the older sister ship to M/V Aurora, and both serve as feeder vessels that pick up passengers in small communities such as Hoonah and take them to larger regional communities (this process is colloquially known as the \\"milk run\\"). The LeConte primarily serves the northern portion of the Alaskan Panhandle in between Sitka and Juneau, but also occasionally ventures into Southeast Alaska as well. In a highly controversial and political change, however, the LeConte was turned into a day boat operated exclusively out of Juneau. This change cut service to the community of Pelican and to the hub of Sitka -- home of the Southeast Alaska Regional Health Center, a hospital that solely serves the Native Alaskan community, the primary demographic of the Lecontes ports of call. The ship's bell, located at the front of the ship. In the summer of 2005, the LeConte made a number of stops in Bartlett Cove, which is one of the gateways of Glacier Bay National Park. The LeContes amenities include a hot-food cafeteria, movie and forward observation lounges, and solarium. There are no cabins on the LeConte both because of its small size and the lack of demand due to its feeder route running times. The LeConte and the M/V Aurora are the only AMHS vessels able to serve the communities of Angoon, Pelican, Tenakee Springs, Hoonah and Kake. These vessels' small sizes make them both vital assets for the ferry system and the residents of these rural villages. ==Grounding== On May 10, 2004, the M/V LeConte nearly sank after running aground on Cozian Reef in Peril Strait en route to Sitka. Eighty-six passengers and 23 crew were on board at the time and all safely evacuated the ship upon grounding. After a Coast Guard response, passengers were evacuated via life rafts to nearby good samaritan vessels — most of them picked up by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration fishery research vessel noaa.gov AFSC Historical Corner: John N.

Soon after, 23,000 gallons of fuel were pumped out of the fuel tanks and cars were transferred to a landing craft in an elaborate procedure. A salvage operation then began and the vessel was successfully escorted to Ketchikan's Alaska Ship and Dry Dock for repairs under tow after temporary patches were put onto the expansive gashes that compromised five separate compartments of the hull -- enough to have sunk the ship had it been lifted off its perch on the reef. Only minor injuries were suffered and only during the evacuation of the boat. The LeConte has now been repaired and is back in service. It is widely agreed a more dire emergency could have resulted had the weather not been so accommodating during the entire salvage process, especially in light of the fact that the LeConte was already listing ten degrees and the tides in Peril Strait were already making the situation highly precarious. After assessing the circumstances of the grounding, it was concluded operator error caused the incident (not the notorious tidal currents that Peril Strait is known for) and those in command of the vessel were fired from the ferry system. ==References== ==External links== * Official Alaska Marine Highway System website * USCG LeConte grounding report and recommendations * Newspaper article covering the LeConte's grounding * American Bureau of Shipping Record Category:Alaska Marine Highway System vessels Category:1973 ships Category:Ships built by Peterson Builders ","title":"MV LeConte"},{"id":"3237477","text":"The Gavilan SC was a laptop computer, and was the first ever to be marketed as a \\"laptop\\". ==History== The brainchild of Gavilan Computer Corp. founder Manuel (Manny) Fernandez, the Gavilan was introduced in May 1983, at approximately the same time as the similar Sharp PC-5000. It came to market a year after the GRiD Compass, with which it shared several pioneering details, notably a clamshell design, in which the screen folds shut over the keyboard. The Gavilan, however, was more affordable than the GRiD, at a list price of around US$4000. Unlike the GRiD, it was equipped with a floppy disk drive and used the MS-DOS operating system, although it was only partially IBM PC- compatible. Powered by a 5 MHz Intel 8088 processor, it was equipped with a basic graphical user interface, stored in its 48 kb of ROM. An internal 300-baud modem was standard. A compact printer that attached to the rear of the machine was an option. The machine's included software was a terminal program, MS-DOS, and MBasic (a version of the BASIC programming language). An Office Pack of four applications—Sorcim SuperCalc and SuperWriter, and PFS File and Report—was optional. It was far smaller than competing IBM compatible portables, such as the Compaq Portable, which were the size of a portable sewing machine and weighed more than twice the Gavilan's 4 kg (9 lb), and unlike the Gavilan they could not run off batteries. Gavilan claimed the SC could run up to nine hours on its built-in nickel-cadmium batteries. Jack Hall, an award-winning industrial designer, was chosen to work out the ergonomics, mechanics and overall appearance of the Gavilan. An extremely compact printer module was the result of a collaboration between Hall Design and C. Itoh of Japan. Additionally, several patentable features such as the unique display hinge and printer attachment mechanism were embodied in the design. The Gavilan sported an LCD display with an unusual resolution of 400×64 pixels. It included a pioneering touchpad-like pointing device, installed on a panel above the keyboard. It used static CMOS memory, and came with 64 kilobytes standard. Memory was expandable through plug-in modules, for which there were four slots available (each 32 kb module cost $350 and included a backup battery); these could also be used for software ROM cartridges. With standards for microfloppy drives still emerging, Gavilan was designed to accommodate both a 3.0-inch 320 KB microfloppy drive as well as a 3.5-inch floppy drive. Slow sales, due to the as yet undeveloped market for laptops, caused Gavilan Computer Corp. to declare Chapter 11 bankruptcy with cash flow problems. The company ceased operations in 1985. ==Reception== BYTE in June 1983 called the Gavilan \\"a traveling professional's dream come true ...

The chain was acquired by Pizza Hut in November 2016 and was officially closed on 1 May 2017. Eagle Boys was founded in Albury, New South Wales, by businessman Tom Potter in 1987. From 1992, Eagle Boys national headquarters were located in Annerley, Queensland. In 2007 NBC Capital, a Queensland-based venture capital group, bought Eagle Boys from Potter. At the chain's peak, in 2013, more than 340 Eagle Boys stores were operating across Australia. Outlet numbers fell drastically between the end of 2013 and the end of 2014 to around 170. In July 2016, fewer than 130 stores remained open and administrators were brought into the head office to identify restructuring options ahead of a potential sale of the business, although the move did not extend to franchisee-operated outlets. In November 2016, Pizza Hut announced to media that it had merged with Eagle Boys. As of that date, 114 Eagle Boys stores operated throughout Australia; making it the fourth largest pizza chain in the country, with less than 10% share of the country's pizza market. ==Stores== More than 340 Eagle Boys stores were operating across Australia at the pizza chain's peak in 2013. Outlet numbers fell drastically between the end of 2013 and the end of 2014 to around 170. At July 2014, Eagle Boys was the third largest pizza chain in Australia, with 12% share of Australia's pizza market. By the end of 2014, Eagle Boys' visitation rate dropped below that of Crust Pizza, and fewer than 130 stores remained open. As of April 2016, Eagle Boys stores could be found in all mainland Australian states and the Northern Territory. The stores had a strong regional emphasis with most outlets located in non-metropolitan areas, including Bathurst, Bendigo and Mareeba. ==History== ===1987–2007=== The first Eagle Boys store opened in Albury, New South Wales, in 1987. It was a venture spearheaded by businessman Tom Potter in partnership with his mother, Barbara Potter, who guaranteed a $70,000 loan to enable him to open the store. The store was initially called \\"Beagle Boys\\" after the Disney Beagle Boys, but Potter dropped the \\"B\\" after a few months in operation, worrying that the naming may have been a copyright infringement. Potter went on to build the business and become CEO of the chain. In 1989, Potter started recruiting franchisees. Eagle Boys' national headquarters were opened in 1992 in the Brisbane suburb of Annerley. Eagle Boys set up in New Zealand in 1996 when Stallone's Pizza owner Gavin Cook agreed to merge with Eagle Boys to provide an established base in the South Island. Rapid expansion saw the Eagle Boys chain grow to 54 national outlets in the country by early April 2000. In 2000, all New Zealand stores were sold to Restaurant Brands for NZ$28m and converted to Pizza Hut outlets. The company developed an express system, called \\"Eaglexpress\\", from 1999 to 2002, to serve two minute \\"express\\" pizzas (limited range of four) between 5:30 and 8:00 pm, which was achieved by constantly remaking their four most popular pizzas and keeping them in a warmer for sale. Unsold pizzas were discarded after 30 minutes. From 2002, when the Eaglexpress concept was launched, to 2003, sales at the chain rose by around 40%. The chain came to see the Eaglexpress two-minute pizza service and its drive-through services as a \\"beachhead\\" to compete with its biggest fast-food competitors including Hungry Jack's and KFC. ===2007 to 2016: NBC Capital years=== In March 2007, Tom Potter handed his control of Eagle Boys on to NBC Capital, a Queensland-based venture capital group. He retained some shares in the company, and worked in a consultancy role advising the chain on operations for 12 months. By 2008, Potter retained less than 10% of the vote for corporate decision making and was no longer involved in operations. In late 2007, Eagle Boys began trialing an online ordering system and announced plans to enable customers to order online from all of its stores by February 2008. By the end of 2008, the system was fully implemented. In July 2008, Eagle Boys entered into a deal to acquire the Pizza Haven chain across Australia. The deal saw Eagle Boys move into Sydney and South Australia for the first time. Between July 2008 and June 2009, Eagle Boys opened 56 stores—the fastest growth the chain had experienced in its history. In February 2010, Eagle Boys was named in BRW magazine's \\"Fast Franchise\\" list for the first time. By March 2011, Eagle Boys had more than 25 stores in Sydney. It had also overtaken Pizza Hut to become the second largest pizza maker in Australia. However, Pizza Hut regained second position by July 2014. CEO Todd Clayton departed Eagle Boys in 2012. He had been in the role since NBC Capital acquired a majority stake in 2007. At the time, the founder of NBC, Bruce Scott, stepped in as CEO. In July 2013, Eagle Boys commenced operations in Papua New Guinea. Worldwide, stores numbered over 330 by September 2013. On 3 October 2014 The Sydney Morning Herald reported that former franchisees asserted that the current franchisor, NBC Capital, had stopped print and media advertising since purchasing the business. The number of stores was reported to have halved from 340 locations. Franchise owners told media they were concerned at changes to the advertising mix, including the reduction of offline advertising activities. Revenue in 2014 fell to $17.4 million, down from $25.2 million in 2012 and $21.1 million in 2013. To capitalise on the benefits of cloud computing, Eagle Boys shifted its ordering system to Microsoft Azure in 2015. Through providing improved website performance and uptime and providing more sophisticated performance metrics, the new hosting system should support more online orders, which the Eagle Boys IT chief says are worth 1.5 times the orders which are made in-store or by telephone. In May 2015, Eagle Boys announced it was aiming to expand with a plan for 50 outlets in India by the end of 2015. The same month a franchisee opened an Eagle Boys store in Suva, Fiji. Eagle Boys appointed Nick Vincent as the new CEO in October 2015, replacing Bruce Scott. Vincent had previously been the company's general manager of retail, since April 2014. ===2016: Sale to Pizza Hut=== On 15 July 2016, Eagle Boys Pizza appointed administrators to identify restructuring options ahead of a potential sale of the business. The administrators, SV Partners, took control of the day-to-day running of the business, and searched for potential buyers of the business. Eagle Boys announced that trade would continue as normal at franchisee-operated outlets during the administration, and franchisees were told their fees were due as normal. Fairfax Media outlets tipped Domino's and Retail Food Group (the owner of Pizza Capers and Crust) as possible buyers. However, Retail Food Group confirmed it was not in discussions with the owners or administrators of the Eagle Boys franchise system in a statement on 19 July 2016. As of November 2016, 114 stores operated throughout Australia, making it the fourth largest pizza chain in the country with less than 10% share of the country's pizza market. In November 2016, Pizza Hut told media that it had merged with Eagle Boys. In a statement, Pizza Hut said that it intended to convert about half of the Eagle Boys to the Pizza Hut brand before Christmas 2016; the remainder it hoped to convert by April 2017. The first store to switch from Eagle Boys to Pizza Hut was on Sydney's northern beaches. ==Marketing== In 1992, Eagle Boys registered its \\"pink glow\\"—the pink look of its logo— with IP Australia, the Australian Government intellectual property office. A customer survey in support of the company's application found people strongly associated the pink glow with Eagle Boys stores. The distinctive colour scheme was designed to create a fun and upbeat feel. In 2007, Eagle Boys launched the \\"Vote 1 Full Size Large Pizza\\" campaign bringing to task its competitors for selling smaller pizzas. Domino's had reduced the size of their large pizzas in mid-2007 and Pizza Hut had changed their sizing in late 2006. The campaign produced a sales uplift of over 27%. In 2009, the pizza chain announced a $7 million advertising campaign, called the \\"Real\\" campaign, that reinforced its \\"Bigger, Better\\" slogan. The campaign involved the VW \\"Real Mobile\\" driving around Australia offering Eagle Boys pizza and recording testimonials for a TV commercial. Later in the year, Eagle Boys launched another campaign comparing its pizzas to those of its competitors, this time built around the \\"blind taste test\\" which found almost half of test subjects preferred Eagle Boys pizzas to those of pizzas from Domino's and Pizza Hut combined. In 2010, Eagle Boys launched a multimillion-dollar campaign \\"31 New Menu Items – Each One Delicious”. The campaign was the first to use Eagle Boys' new phone name 1300 EAGLE BOYS. New pastas were among the 31 new menu offerings, Desserts were also included, among them a chocolate fudge mousse that received a Gold Medal at the 2010 Royal Queensland Food and Wine Show. The menu was tested over a 12-month period ahead of the launch. Eagle Boys told media it expected a 15% spike in sales on the back of the launch. A gluten \\"friendly\\" base was also on the menu for the first time, with an Eagle Boys spokesperson claiming it was more transparent than claiming it could offer a gluten-free base—only food prepared in a gluten-free kitchen can make the claim that it is truly offering a gluten free range. The chain also announced it would scale back its social media spend. In 2011, the chain released advertising \\"Our large pizzas are bigger than theirs\\" in another attempt to demonstrate their large pizza offered effectively an extra slice of pizza to their closest rival, Domino's. Domino's chief executive, in response, told media that \\"value is not in the size of a pizza.\\" Eagle Boys recorded a 20% jump in sales in the first week of the campaign compared to the previous week. The pizza chain also announced it would be supporting the Cerebral Palsy Alliance, with a plan to donate more than $200,000 over three years to the charity, starting with $1 from every dessert sold during Cerebral Palsy week in August 2011. In July 2011, Eagle Boys received Halal accreditation for its Bexley store. Rebranding in 2013 as part of the \\"making pizza happy\\" campaign involved introducing a new logo along with new pizza boxes and uniforms. The iconic eagle was dropped from the logo at time, with management citing pressure from its client base to drop to eagle. The company introduced a \\"happy bell\\" to ring when customers were having a good time—aiming for a happier feeling for the in-store experience. The campaign was rolled out in stages, beginning in Far North Queensland, a decision an Eagle Boys spokesperson said was designed to pay homage to the chain's regional heritage. By 2014, around one-third of the pizza chain's marketing budget was directed to digital spend. That year, the chain released a campaign leveraging off the release of Australian film Fat Pizza vs. Housos. It also announced a partnership with streaming company Quickflix, offering customers an exclusive deal on a one DVD and streaming bundle package. In 2014 the chain also donated more than 600 kg of potatoes to food rescue charity OzHarvest. 2015 saw Eagle Boys launch the first \\"store of the future\\" in Bundaberg. The concept store, with a design including exposed brickwork and recycled timber, was developed based on research carried out on customer preferences and behaviours. In March 2016, Eagle Boys launched a trial of \\"Virtual Drivethru\\" at several of their stores in the Townsville area. The technology enables customers to order their pizzas online, drive to the store and alert store team members that they have arrived by pushing a button so that staff can deliver their order to their customers' cars. ==See also== * Pizza Haven (Australia) * Domino's Pizza Enterprises * List of pizzerias in Australia * List of restaurant chains in Australia * List of fast food restaurant chains * Pizza Capers == References == Category:1987 establishments in Australia Category:Restaurants established in 1987 Category:Pizza franchises Category:Fast-food chains of Australia Category:Australian brands Category:Pizzerias in Australia Category:Pizza chains of Australia ","title":"Eagle Boys"},{"id":"3237512","text":"The Kechika River, also historically known as Black's River, is a tributary of the Liard River, about long, located in northern British Columbia, Canada. ==Geography== The river rises in the Sifton Ranges on the west side of the Rocky Mountain Trench near Sifton Pass.

He had a recurring sketch called \\"Pierre Bernard's Recliner of Rage\\", where he would complain about issues that personally concern him while sitting in a recliner. The issues he complains about are typically esoteric in nature and mainly deal with comic books, anime, drawing or science fiction. ==Biography== Early in his career, Bernard did comic book lettering for major publishers, including Marvel Comics, DC Comics, Heavy Metal, Gold Key Comics, Playboy, Warren Publishing, and Blackthorne Publishing. Bernard worked in the advertising and marketing field for such clients as DFS Dorland Worldwide, McCaffrey & McCall, Inc, and Newsweek magazine doing storyboards and comp presentations. At Prudential Securities he did various brochures and eventually took over their in-house magazine. For the last 15 years Bernard has been doing graphics for Late Night, as well as doing a number of character appearances on the show, including \\"Pierre Bernard's Recliner of Rage\\". The segments were solely written by Bernard himself, with some revisions by fellow writer Brian Stack.

This prompted a \\"response\\" from robotech.com about the complaint and an offer to send Bernard a free complete collection of the DVDs.Yun, Steve \\"Open Letter to Late Night with Conan O'Brien\\" robotech.com June 12, 2004 (accessed December 10, 2008) ====Action figures==== This segment sees Bernard complaining about the Justice League Unlimited action figures. ====Mallomars==== Bernard complains about the seasonal release of the Nabisco snack Mallomars because despite the company's claims that its limited release is due to summer temperature and the difficulty in storing them in such heat, other chocolate covered-related products are still regularly produced and distributed. ====Case Closed==== Bernard complains about The Cartoon Network putting Case Closed on during Cowboy Bebop's usual airtime. He dislikes Case Closed's campy 1970s style tunes compared to Cowboy Bebop's jazzy ones which helped him sleep. Coincidentally, Case Closed's main character takes the assumed first name of Conan in which the host remarks about after the segment. ====Stargate SG-1==== One segment garnered Bernard a cult following in the Stargate SG-1 community. The initial segment was a complaint that Stargate SG-1 was better without Dr. Daniel Jackson (played by Michael Shanks). Shanks had left SG-1 after the fifth season only to return for the seventh season, and Bernard felt Jackson's involvement with the team averted too many action sequences. After the SG-1 production team saw the sketch, they were so excited that Bernard gave SG-1 national TV publicity that they offered him an extra role on an episode of SG-1 as a technician named O'Brien (for Conan O'Brien). Bernard's filming process was recorded and aired as a remote segment on Late Night. When asked if he would return for another episode, he showed a clip where his character is shot after he greets an off-screen Dr. Jackson. He was then invited to an SG-1 convention as a famous guest, which was also recorded and aired as a \\"remote\\" on Late Night. He then appeared in the 200th episode of SG-1, now as a zombied O'Brien, and is shot by a main character. The behind-the-scenes production of this was shown on the May 5, 2006, episode of Late Night with Conan O'Brien. In 2006, Pierre was interviewed by The Scifi World about his appearances on SG-1. After the show was canceled, Pierre returned in another segment of Recliner complaining to the Sci Fi Network regarding the show's cancellation. In a later episode of the show, Conan O'Brien allows Pierre to come on the show and rant about the cancellation of Stargate SG-1. In a follow-up sketch to this rant, Conan announced that he would do Pierre a favor by having Jon Lovitz call the Sci Fi Channel to ask programming executive Mark Stern to reverse the cancellation. ====Bobblehead collection==== After receiving an Empire Today bobblehead doll, Bernard decides to begin a bobblehead doll collection. However, after ordering 60 bobbleheads, he finds that some were in fact figures in which the head remains stationary and the body bobbles. Bernard feels strongly that such figures should be accurately labeled as \\"bobble-body\\" and not \\"bobble-head\\". ====Betty Boop figurine==== Pierre wanted to buy a 5-foot Betty Boop statue for his living room, but, after being told by a female co-worker that a life-size statue of a cartoon character would severely limit his prospects of keeping a girlfriend, Pierre decided, instead, that he would settle for an 18-inch figurine of Betty Boop which he found particularly alluring as she is dressed up in a black French maid outfit. Unfortunately, the website where he spotted the black-outfitted version of the figurine had completely sold out of them, and, while he found another website selling the French maid Betty Boop figurine, the uniform itself was red, which Pierre doesn't find to be a suitable uniform color for a French maid. He wanted to call the company that made the figurine, Character Collectibles, but he complains that he could not find a phone number anywhere on their website. ====Hot Wheels display cases==== In a segment that aired on January 11, 2007, Bernard complains about not finding a suitable display case for his Hot Wheels collection, including the famed Arachnorod model. He wants to display the collection in his bathroom, but one case cannot accommodate trucks, and another has distracting hinges. ====Anime Network==== On the show on April 13, 2007, Pierre expressed his love for Japanese anime and the female voice actors. He stated that he was angry that the East Coast cable providers did not allow him to subscribe to the Anime Network so he could listen to their voices all day. ====Dragon Con==== On the show on September 5, 2007, Bernard complained about his recent visit to Dragon Con. He described it as an event similar to the more popular Comic Con, but one which Bernard thinks is better. His complaint involved waiting in numerous lines, not being able to eat his Chick-fil-A meal, and not receiving a badge of the Dragon Con logo he was counting on getting. ====RedPlum advertisements==== On the show on April 11, 2008, Bernard complained about not getting a Best Buy advertisement. He stated that while he receives weekly mailers notifying him of sales in his area, these ads are typically only for grocery stores. He admits that these are sometimes useful, such as when he was notified about a sale on Pop-Tarts. Bernard's complaint, however, is that he never receives notice of sales at high-end stores or stores that specialize in electronics. Bernard specifically mentions Best Buy. Recently, a special edition DVD of I Am Legend was on sale there. Neighboring areas were made aware of the sale, but he was \\"left in the dark like a fool\\". By the time he found out about the sale, the DVD was regular price and had no bonus disk. He called the distributor responsible for his weekly mailer, RedPlum, and was told there was nothing they could do. ===Pierre Bernard: Serial Killer=== On the show on March 13, 2007, NBC aired a sketch of Conan interviewing Pierre Bernard in a mock news style a la The Today Show or Dateline NBC. The cause of the interview was Bernard's real life refusal to allow the show to tape a remote segment at his house with his sizeable action figure collection. Conan contended that this refusal could be explained only by Pierre Bernard being a serial killer. In the interview Conan asks Bernard questions meant to make Bernard look like a psychotic killer. Conan's florid interview style was contrasted with Bernard's mostly unemotional responses. As the interview went on, Bernard gets more into the spirit of the gag and at one point admitted that he did not describe himself as prolific because \\"I haven't been killing for a long time.\\" The segment ends with Pierre being wheeled onstage in a straitjacket and a face mask in a parody of Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs. ===Other appearances=== Pierre has appeared at other times on Late Night with Conan O'Brien, both as himself and acting as characters. He has portrayed Whoopi Goldberg, the rejected X-Men character Velcroeto, and a character that was supposed to be John Mayer's only black male fan. As himself, in one of his first appearances (if not the first), he appeared in a sketch where Conan took him, another co- worker, and announcer Joel Godard on a spending spree in New York City, following the recommendation that shopping was the best thing one could do to help the city recover following September 11. In another segment, a parody of NBC's The More You Know segments, Bernard advises high school seniors to hire an escort to avoid the anxiety of finding a prom date. He cautions, however, before spending the money, to make sure she doesn't have a penis. In another early appearance, Pierre was brought out in recognition of his appearance in an NBC or Rockefeller Center newsletter noting his dedication to fitness. Pierre appeared in a non-recliner sketch on the June 9, 2006 show. In the segment entitled \\"Prom Primer\\", he gave nonsensical and humorous advice on going to the prom. On the October 17, 2006 show, Pierre was in a comedy sequence about satellite TV channels. He was also in a bit part on the show a few days after as a part of the recurring gag, \\"New Fall Characters\\". In the segment, Pierre was dressed in a diaper and was the African baby that Madonna did not adopt. Pierre appeared in a bit gag on the show's February 13 airing where he was shown exercising on a stationary bike to test the effects of his sweat on females. This was in response to a then-recent study that claimed that male sweat had aphrodisiac-like effects on women. On the 2007 February 26 show, Pierre was in a skit where he reenacted some select scenes from the then-recent Academy Awards show. It was explained by Conan that the sketch was being done due to NBC being unable to show actual clips of the event. In a \\"Hannigan the Travelling Salesman\\" sketch that aired on the Thursday, April 12, 2007 episode of Late Night with Conan O'Brien, Pierre had a cameo as a character dressed in a gym vest and short running shorts named \\"Gay Haitian Lee\\", a word-play on PlayStation 3. During the show's San Francisco excursion in May 2007, Pierre participated in a sketch where he played a San Francisco enthusiast whose calves had grown to enormous proportions walking up the city's hilly streets. In September 2007, Pierre was flown out to Garnett, Kansas, to appear in a local commercial for \\"The Sherwood Inn,\\"\\"http://www.sherwoodinn.biz a local \\"good ol' down-home-cookin'\\" restaurant. The entire commercial was aired on Late Night with Conan O'Brien, and when Pierre was asked how much he was paid for the ad he said he was paid \\"in food.\\" During the bit, Pierre expressed his desire to be in a commercial for the furniture company La-Z-Boy. He appeared as Senator Barack Obama's arm on an episode that aired June 3, 2008, to commemorate Obama's Democratic Presidential nomination, which was confirmed earlier that day. In March 2010, Bernard made his first appearance since the end of O'Brien's Tonight Show in the YouTube video \\"Pierre's Unemployed,\\" where he visits a comic convention in Long Beach, California.\\"Pierre's Unemployed: Comic Convention\\", YouTube, March 5, 2010 In April 2010, Bernard appeared in a Funny or Die sketch named \\"Asian Conan\\" as the operator of an illegal child death fighting ring. He appeared alongside professional stunt coordinator Steven Ho as an Asian version of Conan O'Brien (Who also made frequent appearances on Conan's Tonight) and former Late Night and Tonight Show trombonist Richie \\"LaBamba\\" Rosenberg.Asian Conan Ep. 1 ====The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien==== He appeared on The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien on June 3, 2009, as a joke with Kareem Abdul- Jabbar. ====Conan==== He appeared on a 2013 episode of Conan in which he is given a remote entitled \\"Conan Investigates Pierre Bernard's Creepy Doll Collection\\". ==See also== * Late Night with Conan O'Brien ==References== ==External links== *Totally Graphic official website * *\\"Stargate convention on Conan this week\\" article at Gateworld.net *Text of the Robotech rant (accessed August 20, 2006) *Text of the Betty Boop figurine rant (accessed November 30, 2006) *Text of the Anime Network rant (accessed April 14, 2007) *Open Letter to Late Night with Conan O'Brien on Robotech.com (accessed August 20, 2006) Category:African-American artists Category:American graphic designers Category:American male television actors Category:American television personalities Category:Living people Category:People from Ewing Township, New Jersey Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Pierre Bernard (comedian)"},{"id":"3237529","text":"Heartless Moon is an album by American singer-songwriter Brendan Gamble.

Propagation of two rays in a random medium. Since one can be obtained from the other by time inversion, they interfere coherently when the angle θ goes to zero. The waves are scattered many times while traveling through the medium. Even for incoherent radiation, the scattering typically reaches a local maximum in the direction of backscattering. For coherent radiation, however, the peak is two times higher. Coherent backscattering is very difficult to detect and measure for two reasons. The first is fairly obvious, that it is difficult to measure the direct backscatter without blocking the beam, but there are methods for overcoming this problem. The second is that the peak is usually extremely sharp around the backward direction, so that a very high level of angular resolution is needed for the detector to see the peak without averaging its intensity out over the surrounding angles where the intensity can undergo large dips. At angles other than the backscatter direction, the light intensity is subject to numerous essentially random fluctuations called speckles. This is one of the most robust interference phenomena that survives multiple scattering, and it is regarded as an aspect of a quantum mechanical phenomenon known as weak localization (Akkermans et al. 1986). In weak localization, interference of the direct and reverse paths leads to a net reduction of light transport in the forward direction. This phenomenon is typical of any coherent wave which is multiple scattered. It is typically discussed for light waves, for which it is similar to the weak localization phenomenon for electrons in disordered semi-conductors and often seen as the precursor to Anderson (or strong) localization of light. Weak localization of light can be detected since it is manifested as an enhancement of light intensity in the backscattering direction. This substantial enhancement is called the cone of coherent backscattering. Coherent backscattering has its origin in the interference between direct and reverse paths in the backscattering direction. When a multiply scattering medium is illuminated by a laser beam, the scattered intensity results from the interference between the amplitudes associated with the various scattering paths; for a disordered medium, the interference terms are washed out when averaged over many sample configurations, except in a narrow angular range around exact backscattering where the average intensity is enhanced. This phenomenon, is the result of many sinusoidal two-waves interference patterns which add up. The cone is the Fourier transform of the spatial distribution of the intensity of the scattered light on the sample surface, when the latter is illuminated by a point-like source. The enhanced backscattering relies on the constructive interference between reverse paths. One can make an analogy with a Young's interference experiment, where two diffracting slits would be positioned in place of the \\"input\\" and \\"output\\" scatterers. ==See also== *Back scattering alignment (BSA), a coordinate system most commonly used in radar *Forward Scattering Alignment (FSA), a coordinate system primarily used in optics *Opposition surge An astronomical phenomenon caused by the coherent backscatter effect == References == * * Category:Scattering, absorption and radiative transfer (optics) Category:Mesoscopic physics ","title":"Coherent backscattering"},{"id":"3237563","text":"Mercan Dede (born Arkın Ilıcalı, 1966, Bursa, Turkey), also known as DJ Arkin Allen, is a Turkish composer, ney and bendir player, DJ and producer. He divides his time between Turkey, Europe and North America. He is a world music artist, playing a fusion of traditional acoustic Turkish and other oriental musics with electronic sounds. His best known albums include Seyahatname, Su ( water), and Nar. He has worked in collaboration with Turkish and international musicians such as Susheela Raman, Azam Ali, Dhafer Youssef, Sheema Mukherjee (Transglobal Underground) and Hugh Marsh. ==Early life and education== Dede was born to working-class secular parents in Bursa.Breath of life for old genre He moved to Istanbul from Bursa to study journalism and photography at Istanbul University. Upon his graduation, he received a scholarship from the University of Saskatchewan and moved to Montreal, Canada.Arkin Ilicali ==Career== The Mercan Dede ensemble was founded in 1997,DEDE, Mercan, International Who's Who in Popular Music 2007, Routledge. Entry retrieved from Google Books 2012-01-17. by which time Arkın had been working as a musician for some years. Their first album was Sufi Dreams, released in 1998. This album got a boost when the music was used in a German television documentary on Sufi music. In 2001 he released his third album, Seyahatname, which means \\"travelogue\\" in old Turkish, evoking the era of the great caravanserai crossing Anatolia on the silk road. The sound of the ney goes back to this period, and the music aspires to the spirit of the mystic Sufi poets of that time, such as Mevlana. Dede describes the sound of the ney as \\"a pure, universal spiritual sound\\" evoking deep feelings, deeper than we can comprehend in just our short time on earth. The ney \\"speaks the language of love, instantly comprehensible in the heart, compared to which all the mosques, churches, temples built to decorate (our spirituality) drift away\\". The album is Dede's personal effort to reflect on his own spiritual journey.Liner notes to Seyahatname - rough translation from the Turkish His 2002 album Nâr (which means \\"fire\\" in Turkish) continued in the same vein. In 2004, he released Su (\\"water\\"), which stayed at number one on European World Music Charts for two months. The album was recorded with an international line-up of musicians and has more vocals on it than the previous works. One track featuring folk singer Sabahat Akkiraz was particularly popular in Turkey. Dede made his U.S. debut at the first Globalfest that year, followed by a North American tour and the release of the album Fusion Monster under the name 'Arkin Allen', which has a slightly different twist on his familiar sound. He was commissioned by the Turkish Ministry of Culture as the music director of the Guldestan project to represent Turkish culture and arts all around the globe, working alongside choreographer Beyhan Murphy. The February 2007 album Nefes (\\"breath\\") included Transglobal Underground sitar player Sheema Mukherjee in the line-up. The album includes spoken songs in Turkish, Arabic, and French. Mercan Dede and his Secret Tribe have given live performances at festivals including the Montreal Jazz Festival, WOMEX, the Festival de Trans Musicales and Banlieus Bleus, Arezzo, the Montreux Jazz Festival, the World Roots Festival and the Rhythm Sticks Festival and at more than 100 shows in Vienna, Geneva, Brussels, Cologne, Paris, Amsterdam and Istanbul. ==His music== His sound incorporates traditional instruments and ney from Turkey and other parts of the world, with horns, dance beats, ambient electronic music, and a Sufi spirituality. The name Mercan Dede itself evokes Sufism as \\"Dede\\" is the word for 'elder' in the Sufi traditions, although the name Mercan Dede was inspired from a character in a modern Turkish novel. Dede composes his own music, some of which is rhythmic, some new age. He plays with groups of various sizes and fluctuating membership: the Mercan Dede Trio, the Mercan Dede Ensemble, and the Secret Tribe. The instrumentation used includes electronics and elements of classical Turkish music such as the ney (which he plays himself), percussion, violin, and zither. The groups often include Montreal-based percussionist Scott Russell, Canadian violinist Hugh Marsh, and Turkish clarinetist Hüsnü Şenlendirici. The shows often include men and women in Sufi costume doing Sufi whirling. Dede works as a DJ under the name Arkın Allen, specialising in music related to that of his live groups, in this case house and techno dance music with an oriental flavour.Anthony Ham, Middle East, Lonely Planet ebook (2009), MUSIC: Turkish p.95 (retrieved from Google Books 2012-01-17). Dede has been criticised by Turkish music purists for not being steeped in the Sufi traditions and for not properly representing Sufism in his music and writings.Kudsi Erguner in Roll Magazine, Istanbul. November 2001 Another criticism is that the whirling dancers he uses to accompany his shows do not accurately display the correct dervish routines. However, as more than a ney player, working just as often as a DJ as performing live in concert, with an audience consisting of clubbers, not Islamic scholars, Dede aims to synthesise several different traditions rather than recreate a historically pure music. ==Discography== *Sufi Dreams (Golden Horn 1998) *Journeys of a Dervish (Golden Horn 1999) *Seyahatname (Doublemoon 2001) *Nar (Doublemoon 2002) *Fusion Monster (Numoon 2004) (as DJ Arkin Allen) *Su (Doublemoon 2003) (23 July 2003) *Sufi Traveler (High Times 2004) *Nefes/Breath (Doublemoon 2007) (22 June 2007) *800 (Doublemoon 2007) (5 November 2007) *Dünya/Earth (Onearth Records 2013) *Mercan Dede Box Set (2016, 5 CDs) ==Compilation album== *Sufi Traveler (High Times 2004); this album is a repackaging of both Seyahatname and Nar. ==Achievements== *His album 800 was selected as the World's Best World Music Album of 2008 by WOMEX. *Mercan Dede has been nominated by BBC 3 Awards for World Music in the Middle East and North Africa category twice and three times in the Club Global category. *Su stayed at #1 spot for two months on the European World Music Charts. *Featured in Fatih Akin's documentary Crossing the Bridge. *Composer of some music for the 2003 dance piece Neféshttp://www.pina- bausch.de/de/stuecke/detail/show/nefes/ by Pina Bausch, the German choreographer. ==Collaborations== *Violinist, long-time collaborator Hugh Marsh - (Canada) *Vocalist Susheela Raman - (England, Australia, India) *Kanun virtuoso Göksel Baktagir - (Turkey) *Clarinet virtuoso Hüsnü Şenlendirici, and his group Laço Tayfa - (Turkey) *Vocalist Dhafer Youssef - (Tunisia) *Urban poet and rapper Ceza - (Turkey) *Azam Ali and her group, Niyaz - (Iran) *Classical pianist Fazil Say - (Turkey) *Jazz saxophonist Ilhan Ersahin - (Turkey) *'Arabesque' singer Özcan Deniz - (Turkey) *Folk singer Aynur Dogan - (Turkey) *Pop Musician Peter Murphy - (England, Turkey) *Hurdy-gurdy player Ben Grossman - (Canada) *Dancer Emine Mira Hunter (née Burke) - (Canada) *Dancer Tevhide Tanya Evanson - (Canada) *Turkish folk music singer Sabahat Akkiraz - (Turkey) ==See also== *Music of Turkey *List of musicians ==References== ==External links== *Mercan Dede's official homepage Category:1966 births Category:Living people Category:Ney players Category:Turkish composers Category:Turkish DJs Category:Performers of Sufi music Category:Turkish expatriates in Canada Category:Istanbul University people Category:Rectors of universities and colleges in Turkey ","title":"Mercan Dede"},{"id":"3237566","text":"Yegorov (), or Yegorova (feminine; Егорова), is a common Russian last name that is derived from the male given name Yegor and literally means Yegor's.

Cafà began a promising career in Rome but this was cut short by his premature death following a work accident. He was the older brother of the architect Lorenzo Gafà. == Biography == Ecstasy of Saint Catherine Cafà was born in Vittoriosa, Malta, and given the name Marcello at his baptism on 21 January 1636. After his move to Rome in 1658 or shortly after, he was most frequently referred to as Melchior (or Melchiorre) Maltese. His brother Lorenzo Gafà was one of the leading architects in Malta. Cafà was already an accomplished sculptor when he came to Rome and entered the workshop of Ercole Ferrata, who was not strictly speaking his teacher although he probably helped him refining his technique. Despite soon attracting his own commissions, he stayed in close contact with Ferrata and collaborated with him. In 1660 Cafà signed his first independent contract with Prince Camillo Pamphilj for the relief of the Martyrdom of Saint Eustace in Sant'Agnese in Agone. In 1662 he became a member of the Accademia di San Luca and was even elected its principal in 1667, but declined the honor. Reportedly, he was a close friend of the painter Giovanni Battista Gaulli. Cafà died on the 4 September 1667 after some material collapsed on him in the foundry of Saint Peter's while he was working on the altar decoration for Saint John's Co-Cathedral in Valletta. There is no monument or plaque in his honour in his home city of Vittoriosa, Malta. However, the Maltese Post Office issued several stamps with Cafà's sculptures as motives.Examples here == Works == Martyrdom of Saint Eustace Extremely busy throughout his short life, he only managed to finish a few major commissions himself: *Wooden statue of Saint Paul in St. Paul's Shipwreck in Valletta (c. 1659). *Wooden statue of the Virgin of the Rosary in the Dominican Church, Rabat, Malta (1660–61). *The marble statue of the dying Saint Rose of Lima (signed and dated 1665; Lima, Santo Domingo) was in 1668 the centrepiece for the future saint's Beatification ceremony in Rome's Santa Maria sopra Minerva, and shipped to Peru straight after that event. While it has some formal analogies with Bernini's Ecstasy of St Theresa and possibly influenced in its turn the latter's Death of the Blessed Ludovica Albertoni, Cafà's statue depicts a peaceful death, free from the turmoil in the two works by Bernini. *Saint Thomas of Villanova distributing alms in the church of Sant'Agostino in Rome (1663–69). *The relief in white marble of the Ecstasy of Saint Catherine of Siena at Santa Caterina a Magnanapoli in Rome. The curved polychrome background is suggestive of cloud formations and of a halo, intensifying the idea that the saint is carried to heaven. There are no known dates for Cafà's intervention, but it is generally accepted that he finished it himself, i.e. 1667 or earlier. The wax bozzetto for this work was discovered by Edgar Vella in 1995 and is now in a private collection in Malta. *A bust of Alexander VII exists in an extremely fine terracotta version in the Palazzo Chigi in Ariccia, a signed bronze (dated 1667) is in New York's Metropolitan Museum (photo here) and a further bronze in the Duomo in Siena. A number of Cafà terracottas are in the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, the National Museum of Fine Arts in Valletta, the Museo di Palazzo Venezia in Rome, the Fogg Museum at Harvard University, Massachusetts, and the Museo di Roma. There are various wax reliefs and sculptures by Cafà in Malta: the Valletta Museum has sketches of martyrs, and models for the statues in the colonnade in Saint Peter's Square in Rome. And four reliefs were recently discovered in the Cathedral of Mdina representing the Nativity, the Adoration of the shepherds, the Annunciation and the Glory of St. Rose of Lima. Most unfinished works were completed by Ercole Ferrata, e.g.: *Martyrdom of Saint Eustace in Sant'Agnese in Agone, Rome (1660–69). Cafà's terracotta is in the Museo di Palazzo Venezia in Rome. In 2014, Vella published his discovery of a wax bozzetto by Cafà for this marble relief.Edgar Vella, New Cafà bozzetto discovered, in: Times of Malta, 23 November 2014. *Saint Thomas of Villanova distributing alms in the church of Sant'Agostino in Rome (1663–69).

Batting in the middle order he top-scored in the first match with 46, and again in the second match with 64, when Central Districts had their first victory. He did not play in 1951–52, but returned in force in 1952–53: 103 not out against Wellington, 128 not out and 89 not out against Canterbury, 77 and 31 against Otago, and 43 against Auckland, amassing 471 runs at 157.00. He played in the two Tests later that season against South Africa, making 17, 13 and 44, and was selected to tour South Africa in 1953–54. He failed there though, making only 47 runs in four Tests including four successive ducks. In the Second Test at Johannesburg he was felled by a sharply rising ball from Neil Adcock that struck him over the heart, and was taken to hospital. Although he was not expected to bat again in the innings, he returned to the crease straight from hospital at the fall of the fifth wicket and resisted the bowling for another half-hour.Richard Boock, The Last Everyday Hero, Longacre, Auckland, 2012, pp. 19–20. After the tour he found belated form in Australia on the way home, scoring 142 against South Australia and 60 against Victoria. His highest Test score was 47 (followed by 25 in the second innings) when he opened the batting in a low-scoring game against West Indies at Auckland in 1955–56, and New Zealand finally won a Test match after 26 years of trying. He had hit his highest first-class score earlier that season, 144 against Auckland, as well as scoring 114 for Wellington against the West Indians, having begun playing for Wellington the previous season. Although he played 13 Tests over five years, he made little impact, never passing 50 in an innings, and averaging less than 14 runs per innings. His Test career ended after the damp series in England in 1958, when he completed 1148 runs in first-class matches but again failed in the Tests. Wisden said that \\"at the age of 35, [he] came too late on his first tour of England ... he knew how to punish the loose ball, but he was not happy against bowling of the highest class.\\"Wisden 1959, p. 227. He was one of the leading batsmen in the Plunket Shield in the 1950s: he scored 661 runs at an average of 66.10 for Central Districts, and 1708 runs at 47.44 for Wellington. He won the Redpath Cup for New Zealand batsman of the season in 1952-53, 1956-57 and 1957-58. ==References== ==External links== * Lawrie Miller at Cricinfo * Lawrie Miller at Cricket Archive Category:1923 births Category:1996 deaths Category:New Zealand cricketers Category:New Zealand Test cricketers Category:Central Districts cricketers Category:Wellington cricketers Category:Cricketers from New Plymouth ","title":"Lawrie Miller"},{"id":"3237599","text":"Jingpo Lake or Lake Jingpo () is a lake located in the upper reaches of the Mudan River among the Wanda Mountains in Ningan County, Heilongjiang, in the People's Republic of China.

Burmese is often transliterated \\"dhammathat\\" and the Tai and Mon terms are typically romanized as \\"thammasāt\\" or \\"dhammasāt\\" () Dhammasattha texts are historically related to Hindu dharmaśāstra literature, although they are very significantly influenced by the Theravada Buddhist traditions and literature of Southeast Asia. ==History== The word dhammathat is first mentioned in a Burmese inscription from 13th-century Bagan, although it is likely that dhammasattha texts were transmitted there earlier. Certain dhammasatthas claim to have been compiled during the first millennium. There are nine primary Burmese dhammathats, namely the Manu and Dhammavisala Dhammathats of the Pagan Kingdom, the Wareru Dhammathat (1270), Pasedha (1468), Dhammathat Kyaw (1581), and Pyanchi Dhammathats (1614) of the Taungoo Dynasty, and the Myingun Dhammathat (1650) of the Konbaung Dynasty. The first dhammathat mentioned in Burmese chronicles is the Duttabaung Dhammathat, during the time of Sri Ksetra Kingdom. In traditional Burmese law, the order of precedence was mutual arbitration, yazathats, and dhammathat. Burmese dhammathats were supplemented by interpretive guidance in the form of ameindaw (edicts) or pyandan. There is an extensive tradition of dhammasattha exegesis, particularly in Myanmar. Hundreds of dhammasatth, commentaries, and related legal texts are extant in parabaik (palm-leaf manuscript) form. ==Legal history== Dhammasatths influenced a number of Southeast Asian societies prior to the colonial era in matters concerning marriage, theft, assault, slavery, debt, kingship, property, inheritance as well as other issues. In contemporary Burma, although colonial and post-colonial laws predominate, it remains acceptable practice to use dhammathat in law courts in certain areas of family and inheritance law. == See also == * Burmese literature * Thammasat University of Thailand ==References== * *Andrew Huxley. \\"How Buddhist is Theravāda Buddhist Law?\\" The Buddhist Forum, Volume 1: Seminar Papers 1987-1988.

Irvine was a hard-hitting left-handed middle-order batsman, a fine outfielder who became a regular wicketkeeper and an occasional right- arm medium pace bowler. He played one first-class match as an 18-year-old for a Western Province XI against the International Cavaliers – he turned 19 during the match. But he did not then reappear in first-class cricket until he became a regular in the Natal side in the 1965–66 season. After two seasons of modest batting, Irvine made a big advance in the 1967–68 season, scoring 504 runs in the South African domestic season and hitting his first two centuries. He was, however, pretty much an unknown quantity when he was signed by Essex as an overseas player for the 1968 English cricket season, the first season when limited numbers of overseas players were allowed to be registered without a period of qualification or a special dispensation. Irvine proved a success in county cricket. In his first season for Essex, he scored 1,439 runs, and though he did not score a century, he made his runs fast and hit a lot of sixes. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack for 1969 recorded that \\"rarely did he emerge from a match without hitting at least one six, and in fact he was responsible for more sixes than any other player in first-class cricket\\". He was awarded his county cap in his first season. His record in South African domestic cricket for Natal in 1968–69 was very similar to his English record: a lot of runs but no centuries. He returned to Essex for 1969, and increased his batting average, though Wisden remarked that he was less forthright in his batting. He finally scored a century for Essex in the match against Glamorgan at the end of the season. In South Africa in 1969–70, Irvine transferred to Transvaal. His batting immediately moved up a notch in terms of averages and aggregates and he also started to keep wicket regularly for the team. In that season, South Africa played the last of the pre-apartheid Test matches against a touring team from Australia, and Irvine was selected for all four Tests as a batsman only. He batted at No 6 in the first two matches and then, in the third match at Johannesburg, made 79 out of 117 in the first innings and a quick-fire 73 in the second innings as South Africa took a decisive 3–0 lead in the series. In the final match, batting at No 5, he made 102 in the second innings as South Africa sought, successfully, to bat Australia out of the match. With 353 runs in the four-match series, Irvine finished with a Test average of more than 50. Irvine did not play Test cricket again and in fact never played cricket outside the domestic South African competitions after this brief taste of Test cricket. The South Africans had been due to tour England in 1970, but the tour was called off, and though other players, such as Barry Richards and Mike Procter returned to their English counties for the season, Irvine did not go back to Essex. He played regularly for Transvaal for the next seven seasons, making a lot of runs and also acting as the regular wicketkeeper for the first five years. He was Transvaal captain in 1974–75 and 1975–76. He retired after the 1976–77 season. ==References== ==External links== * Lee Irvine at CricketArchive.com, which lists all matches played by him, with full statistics * Lee Irvine at Cricinfo Category:1944 births Category:Living people Category:South African cricketers Category:South Africa Test cricketers Category:Essex cricketers Category:Gauteng cricketers Category:KwaZulu-Natal cricketers Category:South African cricket coaches ","title":"Lee Irvine"},{"id":"3237677","text":"Kurjey Lhakang,སྐུ་རྗེས་ ཡང་ན་ གུ་རུ་རིན་པོ་ཆེ་གི་ ཞབས་རྗེས་ also known as the Kurjey Monastery, is located in the Bumthang valley in the Bumthang district of Bhutan. This is the final resting place of the remains of the first three Kings of Bhutan. Also, a large tree behind one of the temple buildings is believed to be a terma that was left there by Padmasambhava. ==Mythos== It is believed that Sindhuraja the ruler of Bumthang at the time was at war with another King called Nawchhe(Big nose) and in one of the battles with Nawchhe, Sindhu Raja had prayed for the help of the local deities but it was to no avail and Sindhu Raja had lost his son in the battle. Enraged, Sindhuraja decided to destroy all structures belonging to the local deities, angered by this Shelging Karpo the local deity stole the sog (life force) of Sindhuraja, and thus Sindhuraja fell ill due to this and the local healers were unable to do anything. At this point one of Sindhuraja's attendant sought help from Padmasambhava, who was residing in Nepal at the time, it is said that a cup of gold dust was offered to Padmasambhava, who then entered Bhutan through the route of Nabji Korphu via Mangde Chhu region. After he reached Bumthang, Sindhuraja promised him anything if he could cure him, Guru Rinpochhe then asked for Sindhuraja's daughter Moenmo Tashi Khuedron. Shelging karpo at the time was hiding inside his cave, Padmasambhava had to lure him out of the cave to subdue him. Padmasambhava started performing a cham dance, but although it managed to attract the attention of most local deities it failed to lure out Shelging Karpo. So he then asked Tashi Khuedron to fetch for a pale of water in a copper vase and this source of water which Tashi fetched water from became a source of sacred water called Kurje Drupcchu which is considered to be sacred even now and believed to cure illnesses due to its holy powers. After Tashi Khuedron fetched the water, Padmasambhava used the reflection of the light of the Sun from the vase and directed it towards the cave that Shelging Karpo was hiding in, intrigued Shelging Karpo decided to step out and find out what this reflection was, and when he stepped out Padmasambhava immediately subdued and also had him be a protector of the Dharma. Padmasambhava made Shelging Karpo return the sog of Sindhuraja and thus Sindhuraja was healed. Padmasambhava also meditated at the cave and thus left a print of his body on the cave which is why it is called Kurjey since you can see the imprint of Padmasambhava on the cave.Bhutan times, Last accessed July/2/2019 == References == ==External links== *photo of main building of Kurjey Lhakang Category:Buddhist monasteries in Bhutan Category:Tibetan Buddhist monasteries Category:Tibetan Buddhism in Bhutan ","title":"Kurjey Lhakhang"},{"id":"3237686","text":"Pengam railway station is situated in Pengam on the Rhymney Line of the Valley Lines network in South Wales.

Apart from the common music found all-around Greece, there are distinct types of folk music, sometimes related to the history or simply the taste of the specific places. ==Overview== A Greek of the 18th century playing tambouras. The Greek folk music, in Greek Demotiko or Paradosiako, refers to the traditional Greek popular songs and music of mainland Greece and islands dated to the Byzantine times. It was the sole popular musical genre of the Greek people until the spread of rebetiko and laiko in the early 20th century, spread by the Greek refugees from Asia Minor. This kind of music evolved from the ancient and the medieval Greek era and was established until the present day.\\"Greek Traditional Music\\": Ινστιτούτο έρευνας μουσικής και ακουστικής - Institute for research on music and acoustics.Samuel Baud-Bovy, Δοκίμιο για το Ελληνικό Δημοτικό Τραγούδι, 3rd edition, Πελοποννησιακό Λαογραφικό Ίδρυμα, Ναύπλιο: 1966, pp. 1–13. (Υπάρχει μια συνεχής εξέλιξη από την αρχαία Ελληνική μουσική έως και το δημοτικό τραγούδι, η οποία μαρτυρείται, εκτός από τη γλώσσα, στο ρυθμό, τη δομή και τη μελωδία). The lyrics are based on Demotiki (folk) poetry (usually by anonymous lyricist) and popular themes are love, marriage, humor, death, nature, water, sea, religious, about klephts, armatoloi, various war fighters or battles etc The songs are played mainly in the following tempos: Syrtos (various versions), Kalamatianos, Tsamiko, Ballos, Sousta and Pentozali (Crete). Some notable folk songs include \\"Itia\\", \\"Milo mou kokkino\\", \\"Kontoula lemonia\\", \\"Mou parigile to aidoni\\", \\"Enas aetos\\", \\"Kira Vangelio\\", \\"Gerakina\\", \\"Saranta palikaria\\" and from nisiotika \\"Ikariotikos\\", \\"Samiotisa\\", \\"Thalassaki\\", \\"Armenaki\\", \\"Amorgos Sousta\\", \\"Dirlada\\", \\"Lygaria\\", \\"Psaropoula\\", such as \\"Tilirkiotissa\\" and \\"Psintri Vasilitsia mou\\" (Cyprus). ==Crete== Cretan dancers. Different types of laouto. The Greek islands of Kárpathos, Khálki, Kássos and Crete form an arc where the Cretan lyra is the dominant instrument. Kostas Mountakis is probably the most widely respected master of the lyra, which is often accompanied by the laouto which resembles a mandolin. Askomandoura (a type of bagpipe) is also used. Crete has also a well known folk dance tradition, which includes swift dances like pentozalis and other like sousta, syrtos, trizali, katsabadianos, chaniotikos, siganos, pidichtos Lasithou, maleviziotikos, tsiniaris, ierapetrikos and laziotikos. ==Aegean islands== Various tsampounas from the Cyclades and Dodecanese islands Mariza Koch The Aegean islands of Greece are known for Nisiótika (means from islands) songs; Greek characteristics vary widely. Although the basis of the sound is characteristically secular-Byzantine, the relative isolation of the islands allowed the separate development of island-specific Greek music. Most of the nisiótika songs are accompanied by lyra, guitar, tsampouna, souravli and violin. Notable singers include Yiannis Parios and the Konitopoulos family; Mariza Koch is credited with reviving the field in the 1970s. Folk dances include the ballos, syrtos, sousta, chiotikos, kalymniotikos, stavrotos, lerikos, kamara, michanikos, trata, panagia and ikariotikos. In the Aegean Cyclades, the violin is more popular than Cretan lyra, and has produced several respected musicians, including Nikos Oikonomidis, Leonidas Klados and Stathis Koukoularis. Folk dances in Cyclades include lerikos, syrtos, syrtos Serifou, syrtos Naxou, syrtos Kythnou, Amorgos dance and ballos. One of the most famous singers of Cycladic music is Domna Samiou. In Dodacanese there are prominent elements of Cretan music. Dodecanese folk dances include the trata, ballos, syrtos, kremasti, issos, syrtos Rodou, michanikos and kalymnikos, with origin from the island of Kalymnos. ==Central Greece== In central Greece many folk songs make references to the klephts and their role during the Greek war of independence. Folk dances in central Greece include: antikrystos, hasapiko, kalamatianos, kamilierikos choros, koulouriotikos, syrtos, tsamiko, choros tis tratas, chatzichristos and syrtokalamatianos. The musical tradition of the region is also influenced by the Arvanites. ==Epirus== In Epirus, folk songs are pentatonic and polyphonic, sung by both male and female singers. Distinctive songs include mirolóyia (mournful tunes), vocals with skáros accompaniment and tis távlas (drinking songs). The clarinet is the most prominent folk instrument in Epirus, used to accompany dances, mostly slow and heavy, like the tsamikos, koftos, menousis, fisouni, podia, sta dio, sta tria, zagorisios, kentimeni, metsovitikos and iatros. ==Peloponnese== Folk dances from the Peloponnese include the kalamatianos, kariatidon, monodiplos, tsakonikos, syrtos, Ai Georgis, maniatikos and diplos horos. In the songs there are also references to the klephts. In Mani there is also the tradition of the \\"μοιρολόγια\\" mirolóyia (laments), sung by the old women of Mani. ==Ionian Islands== Mandolin, dominant instrument of the Heptanesian music. The Ionian Islands were never under Ottoman control and their songs and kantadhes (καντάδες) are based a lot on the western European style. Greek kantadhes are performed by three male singers accompanied by mandolin or guitar. These romantic songs developed mainly in Kefalonia in the early 19th century but spread throughout Greece after the liberation of Greece. An Athenian form of kantadhes arose later, accompanied by violin, clarinet and laouto. However the style is accepted as uniquely Heptanesean. The island of Zakynthos has a diverse musical history with influences also from Crete. Folk dances include the tsirigotikos (Cythera), leukaditikos, ballos, syrtos, Ai Georgis, Kerkyraikos (Corfu). Notable songs are \\"Kato sto yialo\\", \\"S'ena paporo mesa\\", \\"Apopse tin kithara mou\\". The Church music (Byzantine) of the islands is also different from the rest of Greece, with a lot of western and Catholic influences on the Orthodox rite. The region is also notable for the birth of the first School of modern Greek classical music (Heptanesean or Ionian School, Επτανησιακή Σχολή), established in 1815. ==Macedonia== Folk dances in Macedonia include Makedonia (dance), hasapiko, leventikos, zonaradiko, endeka Kozanis, samarinas, stankena, akritikos, baidouska, Macedonikos antikristos, mikri Eleni, partalos, kleftikos Makedonikos, bougatsas, kastorianos, tromakton, o Nikolos, antikrystos, sirtos Macedonias and Kapitan Louka. There are also folk songs which make references to the Macedonian Struggle (Greek Struggle for Macedonia), while it is notable the use of tympana, trumpets and koudounia (\\"chálkina\\" in local idioma). Other instruments used include violin, clarinet and Macedonian lyra. ==Thessaly== Folk songs from Thessaly are slow and stately, and include dances like the kalamatianos (popular allover Greece), thessalikos, koftos, tsamikos, kleistos, kangeli, gaitanaki, pilioritikos, svarniara, sta tria, karagouna and galanogalani. Dionysiakos, take place especially every year, before Easter, in Tyrnavos, where occurs the famous Phallus Festival; a pagan fertility festival in honour of the ancient God Dionysus, with food and drink. ==Thrace== Instruments used in ancient Thracian music such as bagpipes (gaida) and Byzantine lyra are still the ordinary instruments of folk music in Thrace. Folk dances include the tapeinos horos, tripati, tromakton, sfarlis, souflioutouda, zonaradiko, kastrinos, syngathistos, sousta, mantilatos, baintouska, tsestos, and apadiasteite sto choro. Traditional Thracian dances are usually swift in tempo and are mostly circle dances in which the men dance at the front of the line. The gaida, a kind of bagpipe, is the most characteristic instrument, but clarinets are also used. The Thracian gaida, also called avlos, is different from the Macedonian or other Bulgarian bagpipes. It is more high in pitch than the Macedonian gaida but less so than the Bulgarian gaida (or Dura). The Thracian gaida is also still widely used throughout Thrace in northeastern Greece. Chronis Aidonidis is the most popular singer of the genre. ==Pontus== A Pontic lyra Pontic music retains elements of the musical traditions of ancient Greece, Byzantine music and the tradition of Caucasus. The prime instruments in Pontic music are the Pontic lyra, which has origins in Byzantine times and it is related closely with the Byzantine lyra and Cretan lyra. They are used also other bowed musical instrument from the West, like the Kit violin and Rebec. Other instruments include drums, lute, askomandoura (a type of bagpipe), davul and aulos. Folk dances from Pontus include omal, atsiapat, dipat, tik, tik diplon, tromakton, Pontiaki serra, ikosiena, and trygona. ==Constantinople== The most known Greek dance and rhythm of Constantinopolitan Greeks is hasapikos. It is originated in the Middle Ages as a battle mime with swords, adopted by the Byzantine military. In Greek it was called μακελλάριος χορός (makellarios horos). The use of politiki lyra and politiko laouto is also common. Hasapiko served later as one of the bases for the sirtaki and it is danced all over Greece, today also with the use of bouzouki. ==Cyprus== Evagoras Karageorgis from Cyprus playing laouto. Cyprus is an independent country, currently contested between the Republic of Cyprus and the internationally unrecognized Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. Cyprus includes a variety of classical, folk and popular genres. Cypriot folk music is similar to the folk music of Greece and includes dances like sirtaki, syrtos, tatsia, antikristos and mainly the use of laouto. ==See also== *Greek dances *Dora Stratou *Swallow song of Rhodes; Greek folk song composed by Athenaeus ==References== Category:Greek music Category:Folk music by country ","title":"Greek folk music"},{"id":"3237694","text":"Burning My Travels Clean is an album by Rocky Votolato.

His mother moved with him to Leningrad when he was one year old. There he grew up and attended school. After graduating from 8th grade Apakidze enrolled in the Leningrad Nakhimov Naval School. In 1971, on the eve of graduation, the chief commander of the academy telegraphed Admiral Sergey Gorshkov about Apakidze's exceptional skills and requested his return to the fleet as soon as he had finished flight school. The Admiral agreed and from 1971 Apakidze began serving in the Soviet military as a naval aviator. The same year he became a cadet of the Yeysk Higher Military Aviation School. ==Military service== In 1975, after his EVVAU graduation in Yeysk, Timur Apakidze was assigned, with the rank of lieutenant, to the 846th Separate Guards Naval Attack Aviation Regiment \\"VP Chkalov\\" of the Baltic Fleet. By 1983, having already been promoted to major, he acted as deputy commander for the same regiment's flight training. During that appointment he introduced hand-to-hand combat training for pilots, being convinced that warriors without a weapon should know how to defend themselves if the situation demanded it. In 1986 after graduating from the Grechkov Naval Academy he was sent to the city of Nikolayev and appointed commander of the 100th Fighter Regiment. He studied shipborne aviation techniques at the \\"Center of Naval Aviation\\". From the late 1980s to the early 1990s he was considered the best Soviet, then Russian fighter pilot, being the first one who would land a Su-27K (Su-33) on deck of the aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov on September 26, 1991. On the same day he performed another three landings and afterwards successfully tested the same maneuver at night and under difficult weather conditions, practically becoming the founder of modern Russian naval aviation. Prior to that Apakidze had lost one of the first aircraft of the series, code-named \\"T-10K-8\\", due to control malfunctions. He survived the incident by ejecting but repeatedly stated that he could not forgive himself for not having saved the fighter. At the time of the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Apakidze served as chief of air combat and tactical training for naval aviation in Saki, Crimea. Refusing to pledge allegiance to Ukraine and also rejecting an offer from the reestablished Republic of Georgia to head its air force, reportedly saying \\"Take an oath only once\\", he departed with at least 16 of his regiment's (the 100th Independent Shipborne Fighter Aviation Regiment) pilots to Severomorsk,https://iz.ru/824716/roman-kretcul-aleksei-ramm/snova-v-nebo-v- morskoi-aviatcii-poiavitsia-polk-geroi Russia taking the regimental colors with him. In 1992 he was appointed commander of Russia's only naval fighter regiment, the 279th (Severomorsk-3). Serving from March 1993 as deputy commander and from November 1994 as commander of the 57th Mixed Air Division of the Northern Fleet, Timur Avtandilovich Apakidze was awarded the title Hero of the Russian Federation and distinction Gold Star by the President of the Russian Federation on 17 August 1995, for the development of efficient carrier based education and training programs and his daring and numerous experimental flight tests with the Su-33. Later that year division commander Apakidze departed with the aircraft carrier Kuznetsov for the Mediterranean Sea for combat duty. During the campaign, which ended in March 1996, his pilots performed 2,500 landings. Apakidze performed take-offs up to seven times a day, giving an example to others. It was around that time that two Israeli F-16s engaged a Russian Su-33 trespassing Israel's airspace but were outmaneuvered. The Russian pilot managed to place himself behind the F-16s that were chasing him but then withdrew.http://www.iaf.org.il/625-19924-he/IAF.aspx Despite these impressive efforts and results, flight activity and intensity dropped from then on. At that point, the only Russian aircraft carrier moved out at sea for only two or three weeks' worth of maneuver training a year, until such activities were ceased completely. Shipborne fighter jets numbered no more than 15 at a time. However it was due to Apakidze's commitment that the Admiral Kuznetsov wasn't scrapped like other Soviet vessels as the result of drastic financial cuts in the military, especially the navy. In 1997 Major General Apakidze started teaching the so-called \\"Pugachev's Cobra\\" and \\"Bell\\" to his subordinates, who then would teach their students. However, they didn't catch on in the long run, since those techniques are considered unconventional and are not covered by any regulations and therefore aren't implemented as a standard drill for Russian fighter pilots. Apakidze was one of only five pilots in the world to master Pugachev's Cobra. In 1998, General Apakidze attended the Military Academy of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Russia and in 2001 was made deputy commander of the Naval Aviation training program. Despite being a senior officer and already tasked with important business, he never stopped flying. At the time of his death, he had flown for 3850 hours on 13 different aircraft and performed 283 deck landings on an aircraft carrier. Not a single pilot died under his command or during his service. ==Airshow accident and death== A bust in honor of Timur Apakidze On 17 July 2001, during an airshow in honor of the 85th anniversary of Russian Naval Aviation, Apakidze's Su-33 crashed while performing maneuvers. At first the show went as planned, but when Apakidze performed a complex maneuver, he reported experiencing sudden technical difficulties and from the ground it could be seen that the plane was out of control. He did not eject despite receiving the command twice. Trying to fly away from the populated area, he aimed for the landing strip in an apparent effort to save the aircraft. Unfortunately, he only made it to within of the runway. Shortly before the collision with the ground, he ejected from the cockpit and suffered multiple fractures, but he died on the way to the hospital and was buried in the Troyekurovskoye Cemetery. Busts and plaques were commissioned in his honor. == Tributes and memorials == *On July 17, 2002, a monument was opened at the Troekurovsky cemetery (area 4) . *The name was given to one of the streets of the city Ostrov in Pskov Oblast, the street on which he lived in the city of Severomorsk—3 in Murmansk Oblast, and one of the streets in the village of Novofedorovka (the former Saki-4 garrison, Crimea). *The name was given to Murmansk's School No. 57. *At the crash site of the Su-33 fighter (Pskov Oblast) a memorial sign was installed. *In the city of Severomorsk, Murmansk Oblast, a bust is installed on Safonov Square. *In the village of Novofedorovka (the former garrison of Saki-4) a bust was installed on the Alley of Heroes. *Memorial plaques in the Nakhimov School, in Saki, Kaliningrad and Severomorsk-3 were opened. *T.A.

When Japanese women pursue men in a fashion similar to nanpa, it is called .Botting, Geoff. \\"Japanese women on top.\\" The Japan Times, April 8, 2001. Reprinted from Spa!, April 4, 2001. Reviewed November 1, 2010 ==Etymology== Nanpa was a new word of the Meiji era with the opposite word Kouha. It was originally rendered in kanji as 軟派 (lit. \\"the soft school\\"). The meaning of nanpa was continually changing and different from what it means today. Initially, it referred to a political term with the meaning of \\"parties with soft opinion and proposition\\" or \\"people who are unable to claim a strong opinion\\" (1892), then it referred to \\"departments or reporters who are responsible for the articles of glossy things like social or literary in newspapers and magazines\\" (1901), eventually it meant \\"a faction of the youth who are enjoying pursuit of the opposite sex and fine clothing\\" (1909). In general, it means people interested more in fun and self-indulgence than in \\"hard\\" pursuits like politics, academia, or athletics. In contemporary Japanese culture, nanpa most often refers to \\"girl hunting\\" and there is a strong negative connotation associated with it. The word for boyfriend hunting by women, gyakunan, derives from , and the first part of the word nanpa. ==Description== Nanpa is seen most often in young men ranging from their late teens to mid-twenties. Groups of \\"nanpa boys\\" will gather around places with busy, predominantly female foot traffic (bridges, subway stations, shopping malls, etc.) and approach women in search of a date. The nanpa groups generally wear high fashion with nice suits, expensive shoes, and extravagant hair styles. Occasionally due to their style of dress, nanpa boys are misinterpreted by foreigners as employees of host clubs, who also roam such areas speaking with various women. Due to the increasing number of nanpa boys and rising complaints, many Japanese regions are reacting more harshly to them. For example, many places young people hang out, such as arcades are posting \\"No Nanpa\\" signs, and police in highly populated Japanese cities have been enforcing these rules. This may be in reaction to a growing fear in young Japanese women of abduction or rape. The Shibuya district is particularly strict on nanpa boys in the wake of the abduction of four girls by a middle aged man in July 2003. ==Same-sex nanpa== Japan also has a same-sex nanpa culture, especially within the gay entertainment district of Shinjuku ni- chome. ==See also== *Dōtonbori: Ebisubashi *Dōkyūsei *Group dating in Japan *The World of Geisha ==References== ==External links == * The Way of Nampa, from THE NAMPA ISSUE - JAPANZINE, JULY 2003; reprinted at The Quirky Japan Homepage. * 'Nanpa: A Beginner's Guide to the Japanese Art of Girl-Hunting' by Ed Lake Available on Amazon.com Category:Dating Category:Japanese sex terms Category:Japanese subcultures Category:Sexual acts Category:Sexual attraction Category:Sexuality in Japan ","title":"Nanpa"},{"id":"3237726","text":"Sankara Nethralaya is a not-for-profit missionary institution for ophthalmic care (i.e., an eye hospital) headquartered in Chennai, India. In the name \\"Sankara Nethralaya\\", \\"Sankara\\" is a reference to Adi Shankaracharya and \\"Nethralaya\\" means \\"The Temple of the Eye\\". Sankara Nethralaya receives patients from India and abroad. Nani A. Palkivala, former Indian ambassador to United States, described Sankara Nethralaya as the \\"Best managed charitable organization in India\\". Sankara Nethralaya has over 1000 employees and serves around 1500 patients per day, performing over 100 surgeries per day. The annual revenue as per the taxes is close to US$100 million. Sankrar Nethralaya was rated among the top 4 ophthalmic institutions worldwide in 2020 by Newsweek. ==History== Shankara Nethralaya in Chennai In 1976 when addressing a group of doctors, Sri Jayendra Saraswathi, the Sankaracharya of the Kanchi Kamakoti Peetam spoke of the need to create a hospital. On the command of Dr. Sengamedu Srinivasa Badrinath, with a group of philanthropists founded a charitable not-for-profit eye hospital. In a solemn function held at the premises of the Vijaya Hospital with Semmangudi Srinivasa Aiyer offering the prayer, Dr. T Agarwal inaugurated the project. On the auspicious day of Vinayaka Chaturthi, 6 September 1978, the hospital came into existence. It was named Sankara Nethralaya, which means \\"The Temple of the Eye\\". Today Sankara Nethralaya has its services running at five locations in Chennai and has services at Mukundapur in Kolkata, Rameshwaram and Tirupati in Andhra Pradesh, and has plans to expand in more states and possibly other countries. Sankara Nethralaya has various fellowships in Ophthalmology such as Vitreo Retina, Glaucoma, Cornea, etc... and also has various fellowships and certificate courses in Optometry such as Binocular Vision, Vision Therapy, Contact Lens, Low Vision, and so forth.

The department of Medical Sociology was established in 1990 with the aim of promoting awareness on eye donation by educating and motivating the public for this noble cause. ==Technology== Sankara Nethralaya was one of the first to implement electronic medical records in its facility with the complete OPD and the procedures done in the OPD available online thereby removing transferring of Records manually between complexes. Very soon electronic medical records will be implemented in the in-patient area. In stem cell research, a collaborative project on corneal stem cells have been underway with Nichi-In Centre for Regenerative Medicine, Chennai (India). ==Academics== ===Ophthalmic course=== From its inception in 1978, the C U Shah Ophthalmic Postgraduate Training Center has been offering fellowship programmes in Vitreo-Retinal Surgery and General Ophthalmology to holders of postgraduate degree and a diploma in Ophthalmology. The center (M C I Approved) offers training programmes for graduates in Post graduation in Ophthalmology. The center also conducts the final FRCS Examination (Ophthalmology) of the Royal College of Surgeons (Edinburgh). ====Courses offered==== * Diplomate of National Board of Examination (DNB) Ophthalmology (three years) recognized by the National Board of Examinations * Diplomate of National Board: Two-year postdoctoral Vitreoretinal fellowship recognized by National Board of Examination * Fellowship in General Ophthalmology, Cornea, Uvea, Oculoplastis, Glaucoma and, Vitreoretinal. Session starts April and October. * Cataract Surgery (Basic & Advanced) Sir Ratan Tata two-month fellowship. Session starts January/April/July and October. * PhD programmes in Ophthalmology, Biochemistry & Microbiology affiliated to Tamil Nadu Dr M G R Medical University, Chennai ===Elite School of Optometry (ESO)=== The Elite School of Optometry (ESO) is the first and leading college of optometry in India offering a four-year professional degree: B. Optometry. The college is run by Sankara Nethralaya in collaboration with SASTRA University, Tanjore from the academic year 2017–18. (Previously in collaboration with Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS), Pilani). Located at close proximity to the Chennai International Airport, Chennai, ESO has a diverse student community coming from states across the country. ESO is considered the IIT of optometry in India. The college gives its students a strong academic foundation and excellent clinical training. Students of ESO are placed well across the world. Many of them completed their MS PHD program on a scholarship from various leading universities of different countries. Few of them are working for leading MNCs across the world. Few of them are heading the research department of known University or hospital. And recently few are part of IIT and contributing to academics at IIT. ===The SN Academy=== The Sankara Nethralaya Academy – with a distinctive series of programmes and expert faculty – aims to create a pool of well-trained eye care professionals competent to meet challenges in ophthalmology. The academy serves as a platform for creating, processing and disseminating knowledge related to eye care, ophthalmic research and hospital administration. The institution offers wide-ranging programmes including allied health sciences like Optometry (M.Optom, Fellowships and Certificate courses), Ophthalmic Dispensing (B.Sc), Medical Laboratory Technology (B.Sc & M.Sc), Hospital & Healthcare Management (BBA & MBA), Hospital Administration (MHA), etc... ==Research== ===Vision Research Foundation=== Vision Research Foundation (VRF) has, over the last two decades, been doing premier work in the areas of ocular infections, cataract, tumours, angiogenesis and genetic basis of eye diseases and pathobiology of other ophthalmic disorders. Scientists working with VRF have developed basic techniques in applied medical biotechnology essential to understand disease processes involved in ophthalmology particularly related to etiopathogenesis and identification of infectious, genetic and malignant disorders. VRF has applied for four patents in Diagnostic Microbiology. One of the patents awarded was on corneal limbal stem cell in vitro expansion for treating ocular surface disorders jointly with Nichi-In Centre for Regenerative Medicine. Five candidates have been awarded PhD degree and 13 doctoral candidates are registered with Tamil Nadu Dr. MGR Medical University and Birla Institute of Science and Technology, Pilani. The main strength of the group lies in the fact that they work together with ophthalmologists and basic vision scientists, besides having a large clinical resource as patients come from all over India to Sankara Nethralaya. Vision Research Foundation has research laboratory facilities in the areas of Pathology, Biochemistry, Genetics and Microbiology. The facilities of VRF were located in an old building which has been demolished providing sufficient space to raise a new building for vision research. ==Teleophthalmology== A unique teleophthalmology project was started in villages in a 100 km radius of Chennai with a mobile bus offering primary eye care. It was inaugurated by the former president of India, Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam, in 2003. The key to the project was a mobile bus, designed by a team from Sankara Nethralaya with assistance from the Indian Space Research organization. ==Sankara Nethralaya Women's Auxiliary (SWAN)== Registered as a public charitable trust in 1984, SWAN volunteers have served Sankara Nethralya. All medical and post operative needs of poor patients, including food and spectacles, are taken care by SWAN volunteers. This apart, SWAN volunteers assists patients in the hospital, help the Medical Records Department, Library, Patient service dept, organise conferences, events, maintain the STD booths, utility and coffee shop at the hospital premises.

It is awarded in many countries by universities and learned bodies in recognition of superior accomplishment in the humanities, original contributions to the creative or cultural arts, or scholarship and other merits. It may be conferred as an earned degree upon the completion of a regular doctoral course of study, usually including the development and defense of an original dissertation, or may be conferred as an earned higher doctorate after the submission and academic evaluation of a portfolio of sustained scholarship, publications, research, or other scientific work of the highest caliber. In addition to being awarded as an earned degree, this doctorate is also widely conferred honoris causa to recognize one's lifetime of excellence in a particular humanistic, cultural, or artistic field, or other notable contributions to society. When conferred as an honorary doctorate, many or all of the standard degree requirements, including application, matriculation, coursework, doctoral dissertation or thesis, and portfolio evaluation may be waived, at the discretion of the degree-granting body. Honorary Doctor of Letters recipients do not necessarily have any previous affiliation with the awarding institution and, in most cases, it is not considered proper for them to use the title of \\"Dr.\\" before their names. Universities, colleges, or learned bodies may award the honorary degree of Doctor of Letters, or the related Doctor of Humane Letters, to luminaries who have been identified as rare exemplars who have enriched the humanities in particular, or humanity at large. Mark Twain was awarded an honorary D.Litt. by Oxford University in 1907 for his literary contributions. Nelson Mandela was awarded honorary Doctor of Letters degrees by the University of Natal in 1993 and the Open University of Tanzania in 2000 for his leadership in the struggle against apartheid in South Africa. ==Britain, the Commonwealth and the Republic of Ireland== In the United Kingdom, Australia, India and the Republic of Ireland, the degree is a higher doctorate, above the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) or Doctor of Education (Ed.D.), for example, and is awarded on the basis of high achievement in the respective field or a long record of research and publication. The D.Litt. degree is awarded to candidates whose record of published work and research shows conspicuous ability and originality and constitutes a distinguished and sustained achievement. University committee and board approval is required, and candidates must provide documented mastery of a particular area or field. The degree may also be awarded honoris causa to such individuals as the awarding institution deems worthy of this highest academic award. At the University of Oxford, the degree was established in 1900 as part of the development of graduate-level research degrees that began with the introduction of the B.Litt. and B.Sc. degrees in 1895. Until then, Oxford had focused on undergraduate teaching, with the doctorates, such as those in divinity (D.D.) and medicine (D.M.) traditionally reserved for established scholars. The German paradigm, adopted by the Americans, that created a demand for the philosophiae doctor (Ph.D.) degree as a basic qualification for an academic career, was not immediately adopted at Oxford, but it did create pressure for Oxford to offer a degree for this purpose.M.G. Brock and M.C Curthouys, eds., The History of the University of Oxford., vol. VII, part 2: Nineteenth Century Oxford, (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000), p. 619. Rather than use the D.Litt. degree, Oxford eventually created its doctor of philosophy (D.Phil.) degree in 1915, deliberately using a distinctive English, rather than a Latin, title and abbreviation for it. The D.Phil. became an accelerated, supervised, degree of lower status than the D.Litt. When it was established in 1900, the Oxford Doctor of Literature (D.Litt.) degree could be awarded to individuals who had a standing of thirty- four terms from the award of a B.Litt. degree, or of thirty-nine terms (thirteen academic years) from the award of an Oxford master of arts M.A. degree, providing they could provide \\"fitness for the degree in published books or papers, containing an original contribution to the advancement of learning.\\"Brian Harrison, ed., The History of the University of Oxford, vol. VIII: The Twentieth Century (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1994), p. 125. The required number of terms changed over the years, depending on the prior Oxford degree that a candidate held, and the requirements became more specific. By 2015, The Oxford University Examination Regulations called for a faculty board at Oxford to \\"appoint judges to consider the evidence submitted by any candidate, and to report thereon to the board. In making their report the judges shall state whether the evidence submitted constitutes an original contribution to the advancement of knowledge of such substance and distinction as to give the candidate an authoritative status in some branch or branches of learning.\\"University of Oxford. Examination Regulations. Between 1923 and 2016, Oxford awarded 219 D.Litt. degrees, of which 196 were awarded to men and 23 to women. Among the six higher doctoral degrees at Oxford (D.D., D.M., D.C.L., D.Litt., D.Sc., D.Mus.), the D.Litt. comprised 27.5% of the higher doctorates awarded during this 93-year period.Report of the Review of Higher Degrees, University of Oxford, 2016, table 1, page 8. In June 2016, the Oxford D.Litt. was suspended, pending a reform of the higher doctorates.Education Committee: Suspension of higher degrees, Oxford University Gazette vol. 146 no. 5137 (16 June 2016) The reforms were completed in June 2018 and applications reopened in September 2018. The new regulations reduced the number of higher doctorates to five by dropping the Doctor of Medicine as a higher doctorate. The standards for the remaining doctorates, including the D.Litt. (now also referred to as \\"Doctor of Letters\\" rather than Doctor of Literature), require the judges \\"to consider whether the evidence submitted demonstrates excellence in academic scholarship and is: * a) of the absolute highest quality; * b) substantial in scale and in the contribution it has made to knowledge; * c) sustained over time and showing current and continued contribution to scholarship; * d) authoritative, being able to demonstrate impact on the work of others; * e) of global reach and international importance within the field; and * f) of such breadth or covering such branches of knowledge appropriate to the field and in line with disciplinary norms and expectations.\\"University of Oxford Regulations for Higher Doctorates ==United States== In the United States, the degree may be conferred as an honorary degree or an earned degree. Numerous American universities regularly award the honorary Doctor of Letters (D.Litt.) degree, including Harvard University,Honorary degrees awarded at Commencement. Harvard University Gazette Online. June 5, 2008. Columbia University, and Yale University, among others. At Drew University, the earned Doctor of Letters (D.Litt.) program requires the completion of 45 graduate credit hours beyond the master's degree, including the successful development and defense of a 150–220 page doctoral dissertation., Drew University ==France== In France the doctorat is awarded with a speciality, but there is no official list of these. Candidates for a doctorat in literature are awarded a Doctorat ès lettres, abbreviated Dr ès l. There is a higher degree, the Habilitation à diriger des recherches, which is obtained following different rules in each field. In literature, the candidates must also present a new and unpublished work. The habilitation (which is not followed by an indication of the field) allows holders to apply for a position of professor in French universities. Before the 1950s, the now- abolished Doctorat d'État degree was called Doctorat ès lettresAlan D.

It used to be placed in the genus Amphispiza, but evidence from 2007 and 2009 suggested it be placed in its own genus.Klicka and Spellman, 2007; DaCosta et al., 2009 == Habitat == Sagebrush sparrows are indeed often tied to sagebrush habitats, although they can also be found in brushy stands of saltbush, chamise, and other low shrubs of the arid interior west. The species breeds in the interior of the Western United States (between the Rocky Mountains and the coastal ranges such as the Cascades). It winters in the Mexican-border states and northern Sonora and Chihuahua. The habitat of sagebrush sparrows is frequently threatened by bush encroachment or the invasion of herbaceous plants. == Population == Although sagebrush sparrow numbers are generally strong, significant declines in sagebrush habitat in the west could be expected to decrease populations in the near future. The sagebrush sparrow, together with the Bell's sparrow, were considered conspecific and known as the sage sparrow before being split by the American Ornithological Society in 2013. ==References== * Klicka, J., and G.

The compositional elements of garden design and landscape design are: terrain, water, planting, constructed elements and buildings, paving, site characteristics and genius loci, and the local climatic qualities. ==Services== Garden designers are skilled specialists dealing with master planning of landscapes and design of gardens, consulting with advice for clients, providing direction and supervision during construction, and the management of establishment and maintenance once the garden has been created. They are able to survey the site, and prepare drawings for the development of a garden from concepts to construction, and source the plant and building materials. Historically, many gardens have been designed by talented amateurs without formal training, and many others have been designed by people whose artistic or design training was not originally focused on gardens. The complexities in contemporary environmental design issues and technology increase the scope professional garden designers fill. ==Methods== Edward Kemp's How to lay out a Garden. The drawing shows how to plant a group of trees framing views to the scenery beyond A wide range of design methods have been used by garden designers, depending partly on the historical period in which they worked and partly on the professional discipline with which they have the closest relationship. One can, for example, speak of an \\"architect's garden\\", \\"artist's garden\\" or a \\"plantsman's garden\\". Treating the subject historically, one can say that ancient gardens were likely to have been \\"drawn\\" directly on the ground, that Renaissance gardens were drawn on paper and that modern gardens are drawn on a computer. The design process always has an influence on the design product. There tends to be a distinction between those designers who start with the plant palette and its needs, called garden design; and those designers who begin with consideration of the space and place-making to create architectural spaces and circulation routes with plants and other elements, called landscape design. Many famous gardens which contain many interesting plants can be incompletely planned as a whole and integrated composition. Also, many gardens which are well planned in overall design can lack the interests from planting detail. Some keen gardeners who are very knowledgeable about plants can be resistant to conceptualizing design. Some very competent designers and landscape architects have a meager amount of diverse botanical and horticultural knowledge and experience. A competent and talented garden designer can synthesize both needs to design sand create beautiful and sustainable landscapes and gardens. ==Garden design education== Historically, garden designers were trained under the apprentice system, such as André Le Nôtre with his father and Beatrix Farrand with Charles Sprague Sargent. Specialist university-level landscape planning and garden design courses were established in the twentieth century, generally attached to departments of agriculture, horticulture, or architecture. In the second half of the twentieth century many of these courses changed their scale of focus and their nomenclature, from garden design to landscape architecture. Towards the end of the twentieth century a number of BA garden design curricula were established with the emphasis more on design than horticulture. Horticultural colleges, in ornamental horticulture departments, and architecture colleges, in landscape architecture departments, continue to train contemporary garden designers. ==See also== * Gardener *History of gardening *Index of gardening articles ==References== == Additional sources == * Sylvia Crowe, Garden Design Antique Collector's Club, 2003. * Marie-Luise Gothein A history of garden art (English edition) 1928. * Tom Turner, Garden history philosophy and design 2000 BC to 2000AD Spon Press, 2005. * Roger Turner, Better Garden Design Batsford Press, 1986. * R.

They extend the basic type of grammars, the context-free grammars, with a conjunction operation. Besides explicit conjunction, conjunctive grammars allow implicit disjunction represented by multiple rules for a single nonterminal symbol, which is the only logical connective expressible in context-free grammars. Conjunction can be used, in particular, to specify intersection of languages. A further extension of conjunctive grammars known as Boolean grammars additionally allows explicit negation. The rules of a conjunctive grammar are of the form :A \\\\to \\\\alpha_1 \\\\And \\\\ldots \\\\And \\\\alpha_m where A is a nonterminal and \\\\alpha_1, ..., \\\\alpha_m are strings formed of symbols in \\\\Sigma and V (finite sets of terminal and nonterminal symbols respectively). Informally, such a rule asserts that every string w over \\\\Sigma that satisfies each of the syntactical conditions represented by \\\\alpha_1, ..., \\\\alpha_m therefore satisfies the condition defined by A. == Formal definition == A conjunctive grammar G is defined by the 4-tuple G = (V, \\\\Sigma, R, S) where # is a finite set; each element v\\\\in V is called a nonterminal symbol or a variable. Each variable represents a different type of phrase or clause in the sentence. Variables are also sometimes called syntactic categories. # is a finite set of terminals, disjoint from , which make up the actual content of the sentence. The set of terminals is the alphabet of the language defined by the grammar . # is a finite set of productions, each of the form A \\\\rightarrow \\\\alpha_1\\\\&\\\\ldots\\\\&\\\\alpha_m for some A in V and \\\\alpha_i \\\\in (V\\\\cup\\\\Sigma)^*. The members of are called the rules or productions of the grammar. # is the start variable (or start symbol), used to represent the whole sentence (or program). It must be an element of . It is common to list all right-hand sides for the same left-hand side on the same line, using  (the pipe symbol) to separate them. Rules A\\\\rightarrow\\\\alpha_1\\\\&\\\\ldots\\\\&\\\\alpha_m and A\\\\rightarrow\\\\beta_1\\\\&\\\\ldots\\\\&\\\\beta_n can hence be written as A\\\\rightarrow\\\\alpha_1\\\\&\\\\ldots\\\\&\\\\alpha_m\\\\ \\\\ \\\\beta_1\\\\&\\\\ldots\\\\&\\\\beta_n. Two equivalent formal definitions of the language specified by a conjunctive grammar exist. One definition is based upon representing the grammar as a system of language equations with union, intersection and concatenation and considering its least solution. The other definition generalizes Chomsky's generative definition of the context-free grammars using rewriting of terms over conjunction and concatenation. ===Definition by derivation=== For any strings u, v \\\\in (V \\\\cup \\\\Sigma \\\\cup \\\\\\\\{ \\\\text{“(”}, \\\\text{“}\\\\&\\\\text{”}, \\\\text{“)”} \\\\\\\\})^{*}, we say directly yields , written as u\\\\Rightarrow v\\\\,, if * either there is a rule A \\\\rightarrow \\\\alpha_1 \\\\& \\\\ldots \\\\& \\\\alpha_m \\\\in R such that u\\\\,=u_{1} A u_{2} and v\\\\,=u_{1} (\\\\alpha_1 \\\\& \\\\ldots \\\\& \\\\alpha_m) u_{2}, * or there exists a string w \\\\in (V \\\\cup \\\\Sigma)^{*} such that u\\\\,=u_{1} (w \\\\& \\\\ldots \\\\& w) u_{2} and v\\\\,=u_{1} w u_{2}. For any string w \\\\in \\\\Sigma^{*}, we say generates , written as S \\\\ \\\\stackrel{*}{\\\\Rightarrow} \\\\ w, if \\\\exists k\\\\geq 1\\\\, \\\\exists \\\\, u_{1}, \\\\cdots, u_{k}\\\\in (V \\\\cup \\\\Sigma \\\\cup \\\\\\\\{ \\\\text{“(”}, \\\\text{“}\\\\&\\\\text{”}, \\\\text{“)”} \\\\\\\\})^{*} such that S = \\\\, u_{1} \\\\Rightarrow u_{2} \\\\Rightarrow \\\\cdots \\\\Rightarrow u_{k} \\\\, = w. The language of a grammar G = (V, \\\\Sigma, R, S) is the set of all strings it generates. === Example === The grammar G = (\\\\\\\\{S, A, B, C, D\\\\\\\\}, \\\\\\\\{a, b, c\\\\\\\\}, R, S), with productions :S\\\\rightarrow AB \\\\& DC, :A\\\\rightarrow aA\\\\ \\\\ \\\\epsilon, :B\\\\rightarrow bBc\\\\ \\\\ \\\\epsilon, :C\\\\rightarrow cC\\\\ \\\\ \\\\epsilon, :D\\\\rightarrow aDb\\\\ \\\\ \\\\epsilon, is conjunctive. A typical derivation is :S \\\\Rightarrow (AB \\\\& DC) \\\\Rightarrow (aAB \\\\& DC) \\\\Rightarrow (aB \\\\& DC) \\\\Rightarrow (abBc \\\\& DC) \\\\Rightarrow (abc \\\\& DC) \\\\Rightarrow (abc \\\\& aDbC) \\\\Rightarrow (abc \\\\& abC) \\\\Rightarrow (abc \\\\& abcC) \\\\Rightarrow (abc \\\\& abc) \\\\Rightarrow abc It can be shown that L(G) = \\\\\\\\{a^nb^nc^n:n \\\\ge 0\\\\\\\\}. The language is not context-free, proved by the pumping lemma for context-free languages. ==Parsing algorithms== Though the expressive power of conjunctive grammars is greater than those of context-free grammars, conjunctive grammars retain some of the latter. Most importantly, there are generalizations of the main context-free parsing algorithms, including the linear-time recursive descent, the cubic-time generalized LR, the cubic-time Cocke-Kasami-Younger, as well as Valiant's algorithm running as fast as matrix multiplication. ==Theoretical properties== A property that is undecidable already for context-free languages or finite intersections of them, must be undecidable also for conjunctive grammars; these include: emptiness, finiteness, regularity, context-freeness,Given a conjunctive grammar, is its generated language empty / finite / regular / context-free? inclusion and equivalence.Given two conjunctive grammars, is the first's generated language a subset of / equal to the second's? The family of conjunctive languages is closed under union, intersection, concatenation and Kleene star, but not under string homomorphism, prefix, suffix, and substring. Closure under complement and under ε-free string homomorphism are still open problems (as of 2001). The expressive power of grammars over a one-letter alphabet has been researched. This work provided a basis for the study of language equations of a more general form. == Synchronized alternating pushdown automata == Aizikowitz and Kaminski introduced a new class of pushdown automata (PDA) called synchronized alternating pushdown automata (SAPDA). They proved it to be equivalent to conjunctive grammars in the same way as nondeterministic PDAs are equivalent to context-free grammars. == Notes == == References * * * Technical report version (pdf) Category:Formal languages ","title":"Conjunctive grammar"},{"id":"3237779","text":"The Kimberley Regiment is an infantry regiment of the South African Army. As a reserve unit, it has a status roughly equivalent to that of a British Army Reserve or United States Army National Guard unit. ==History== ===Volunteer Forces on the Diamond Fields=== The regiment's origins lie in the early, lawless, diamond rush days in Kimberley in the 1870s. To bring law and order to the region, which was then known as Griqualand West, the government encouraged the formation of part-time volunteer forces. Among them were the Kimberley Light Horse and the Du Toitspan Hussars, both formed in 1876, which amalgamated in 1877 to form the Diamond Fields Horse. Volunteers from the DFH served in the 9th Frontier War in 1877, in operations in Griqualand West in 1878, and in the Basutoland Gun War in 1880 and 1881.Diamond Fields Horse insignia circa 1877 Kimberley later raised two more units, the Victoria Rifles of Kimberley in 1887, and the Kimberley Scots in 1890. They, along with the Diamond Fields Artillery, amalgamated in 1890 to form the Kimberley Rifles. Both the DFH and the Kimberley Rifles served in the 1896-1897 Bechuanaland campaign. In 1899, the two units amalgamated to form the Kimberley Regiment. Regimental traditions have survived from each of the constituent cavalry, artillery and rifle units, with a distinctly Scottish element very much in evidence in the uniforms, pipe band and regimental culture to this day. Kimberley Regiment Cap Badge circa 1899 ===Anglo Boer War=== During the Anglo- Boer War of 1899 to 1902, the Regiment helped to defend the city during the four-month-long Siege of Kimberley. It is one of only two regiments of the British Empire holding as a Battle Honour the defence of its own city - in this instance Defence of Kimberley. ===Union Defence Force=== On 1 July 1913 the Regiment was embodied in the Citizen Force of the Union Defence Forces, as the 7th Infantry (Kimberley Regiment). ===World War One=== During World War I, it fought in the German South-West Africa campaign in 1915, providing two battalions. It further provided 'C' Company of the composite 1st Regiment of the 1st South African Brigade which fought in France. At Delville Wood, Private William Faulds (later Captain ) was the only South African to be awarded the Victoria Cross for his part in that epic battle. The title of the Regiment reverted to Kimberley Regiment in 1932. ===World War Two=== During World War II, the Kimberley Regiment fought in Italy in 1944 and 1945, forming the Motor Battalion together with the Imperial Light Horse Regiment in the Armoured Brigade of the 6th South African Armoured Division throughout the Italian Campaign. Winning Battle Honours and awards for bravery, the Kimberley Regiment also suffered more casualties than any other South African regiment in the campaign. ===Border War=== Kimberley Regiment was the first to become officially bilingual (English and Afrikaans) in South Africa, in 1963. It was later, in 1977, the first South African Regiment to apply to become multiracial, although the request was not approved at the time. The regiment served in the South African Border War in the 1970s and 1980s. ===SANDF Era=== Since 1994 it has been deployed in peace-keeping roles in the Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo. == Leadership == ==Alliances== * - The Duke of Lancaster's Regiment (King's Lancashire and Border) ==Battle honours== The twenty authorised Battle Honours on the Regimental Colour include: *Gaika- Gcaleka 1877 - 1878 *Griqualand West 1878 *Basutoland 1880 - 1881 *Transkei 1880 - 1881 *Bechuanaland 1896 - 1897 *Siege of Kimberley *South Africa 1899 - 1902 *South-West Africa 1914 - 1915 *Italy 1944 - 1945 *Cassino II *Celleno *Florence *The Greve *Gothic Line *Monte Porro del Bagno *Monte Vigese *Monte Salvaro *Po Valley ==Insignia== ===Current Dress Insignia=== SANDF era Infantry Formation insignia ==See also== * Kimberley Star ==References== Category:Infantry regiments of South Africa Category:Military units and formations established in 1876 Category:Kimberley, Northern Cape Category:Military units and formations of the Second Boer War Category:Military units and formations of the British Empire Category:Military units and formations of South Africa in the Border War Category:Military units and formations of South Africa in World War I Category:1876 establishments in Griqualand West ","title":"Kimberley Regiment"},{"id":"3237785","text":"The Studium Biblicum Version (Sīgāo Běn 思高本) is the predominant Chinese language translation of the Bible used by Chinese Catholics. It is considered by many to be the Chinese Catholic Bible. The Studium Biblicum Version was translated by the Studium Biblicum Franciscanum in Hong Kong (a bible society not affiliated with the United Bible Societies). Translation originally started in 1935 as a personal effort by a Franciscan Friar, the Blessed Gabriele Allegra, but translation work was halted due to World War II, and part of the finished translations were lost due to the war. The bible society was formed in 1945 when more translators joined the translation work, and the whole bible was completed in 1968. The translation was mostly based on the original Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek manuscripts, but occasionally on an unidentified existing translation for “difficult passages”. Postulations by modern scholars were deliberately avoided, but the Greek manuscript edited by the Protestant scholars Aland, Black, Metzger, and Allen Wikgren was used as a reference as an ecumenical gesture. The Studium Biblicum Version is considered by many, including some Protestants, to be very faithful to the original manuscripts. Like many Catholic bibles, this translation includes numerous footnotes. The bible also includes several appendices. The language of the Studium Biblicum Version is standard modern written Chinese, though some of the wordings may appear unnatural in Mandarin but still used in Cantonese (and might be considered unnatural by some precisely because some people do not expect such forms to be written). Standard transliterations are mostly used where they exist; in other cases, a transliteration based on Mandarin is used. ==Typography of the Studium Biblicum Version== Text in the Studium Biblicum Version is typeset vertically from right to left. The typography is generally modern, with a small number of archaisms. The Studium Biblicum Version uses standard Chinese punctuation, with the exception that the proper name mark and book title mark are both typeset on the right side instead of the currently- standard left. Among the old-style typography used are the use of sans serif type for emphasis (mostly chapter and section headings), and typesetting most punctuation marks as if they were ruby. Verse numbers are typeset on the right-hand side of the first word of each verse as ruby. Notes are typeset as footnotes; however, because it is typeset vertically, the footnotes appear on the far left side of the spread, instead of the bottom of the page. Typesetting the proper name and book title marks on the right causes clashes with verse numbers and most punctuation marks. When clashes occur, the proper name or book title mark that causes the clash are omitted for the character with the clash; this typographic treatment causes parts of some proper names or book titles to be unmarked. The characters used for Bible names, and consequently for many Bible books, differ from those in Protestant Chinese Bibles such as the standard Chinese Union Version. For example, \\"John\\" is 若望 (Ruò wàng) rather than the 约翰 （Yuēhàn） found in Protestant Bibles and secular sources. ==Online versions== As the Studium Biblicum version is not in the public domain, permission to create online versions of this translation is granted on a case-by-case basis.

His brothers were the historian Malcolm Laing and the travel writer Samuel Laing. In 1799 he appears as a merchant living at 26 St Andrew Square in Edinburgh's New Town still under the name of Gilbert Laing.Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1799-1800 He is thought to have adopted the suffix \\"Meason\\" upon his marriage. Laing Meason lived on an estate called Lindertis, in Forfar, and was a friend of Sir Walter Scott. He was interested in art history, and in 1828 published a book called On The Landscape Architecture of the Great Painters of Italy (London, 1828). It dealt with the way that buildings and structures were sited within landscapes to produce beautiful compositions. The book sold poorly. Although essentially a work of art criticism, Laing Meason touched on subjects, such as the placing of buildings and their surroundings, which form a central part of the modern landscape architect's work. Laing Meason had no reason to believe that the term he used would become popular. The term would probably have died out if it had not been taken up by the horticulturalist and planner John Claudius Loudon. Loudoun thought that the term had a wider application outside art theory, and explained this view in an article in the contemporary Gardener's Magazine. He felt that the phrase aptly described the composition of created landscapes, and cited the gardens of Deepdene as an exemplar. The term was picked up by Loudon's American admirer Andrew Jackson Downing, from whom Frederick Law Olmsted presumably first heard it. Olmsted was the first professional to describe himself as a 'landscape architect', and is considered to be the founder of the modern profession of landscape architecture. In 1813 he employed the Edinburgh architect Archibald Elliot to remodel his mansion at Lindertis House. In 1815 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were Thomas Allan, John Playfair and Thomas Charles Hope.

Companies, governments and nonprofit organizations may compensate their employees or officers for necessary and reasonable expenses; under US law, these expenses may be deducted from taxes by the organization and treated as untaxed income for the recipient provided that accountability conditions are met. UK law provides for deductions for travel and subsistence. Reimbursement is also provided for supply, day care, mobile, medical, or education expenses, as determined by the payer. Similarly, a university, academic conference, or business conference may reimburse the expenses of an invited speaker or attendee. Reimbursement is also used in insurance, when a provider pays for expenses after they have been paid directly by the policy holder or another party. This is especially relevant in health insurance, due to urgency, high costs, and administrative procedures which may cause a healthcare provider to incur costs pending reimbursement by a private or public provider (in the US, e.g., Medicare or a Health Reimbursement Account). Segments of the healthcare industry, such as medical device manufacturers, rely on reimbursement for income and produce resources assisting their customers (hospitals, physicians, etc.) in obtaining reimbursement. Governments may reimburse taxpayers in several ways. A tax refund reduces the net tax paid, such as income tax, potentially to zero. Taxpayers may receive complete reimbursement for other taxes, such as for Value-added tax due to low income, subsequent export of the goods sold, or not being the final recipient. A local government may use reimbursement to reduce property taxes for a favored organization or low- income individual. ==Barriers to reimbursement== Organizations have motive to limit reimbursement expenses, whether fraudulent, frivolous, or legitimate. If a reimbursement process is made cumbersome or inconvenient to the applicant, then the probability that the applicant will successfully obtain the funds decreases, regardless of legitimacy, resulting in fewer paid reimbursement claims overall. Elements of cost-reducing reimbursement processes include: * Insistence on enabling the action to be conducted (instead of email or online forms) * Lengthy forms requiring detailed explanations * Requiring that the applicant submit paper forms * Requiring that original receipts (instead of copies) be attached with form * Requiring that the applicant personally deliver documents to specific locations, which may be distant and have narrow and inconvenient operating hours * Stringent rejection of forms with errors, even if the errors are minor or inconsequential * Issuing paper checks (instead of cash or direct deposit), and possibly requiring that these be received at specific locations In addition, a variety of tactics for denying reimbursement, including rescission, are associated with the insurance industry. ==References== Category:Insurance Category:Tax Category:Expense ","title":"Reimbursement"},{"id":"3237878","text":"Michael Robert Quinlan (born December 9, 1944) is a graduate, and currently the chairman, of Loyola University Chicago, where he was initiated into the Alpha Delta Gamma National Fraternity.

Go Home Lake is a natural lake which is actually part of the Musquash River system also spelled as Musquosh River on some maps. It was opened up as a recreational lake starting in the late 1950s when Crown Lands were surveyed, subdivided and auctioned off in Public Bids that took place from 1958 through 1962. In the early 60's the construction of two dams was completed, a permanent earthen dam at the Go Home River outlet and a stop log dam (control dam) at the Musquash River outlet. The intent of the dams was to control the water level to maintain a constant water level throughout the boating season eliminating the seasonal fluctuations in the water level. There is actually two stories about how the Lake was named, one is It was named after Go Home Bay, immediately downstream. Loggers would send timber down the Musquash River and meet steamers at Go Home Bay, which would transfer timber to various mills around the Great Lakes and then \\"go home\\", hence the name. The other story dates further back to when the Voyageurs travelled down Georgian Bay from the French River and met the Indians that lived along the shore of Georgian Bay at the mouth of the Go Home River (Go Home Bay). The Indians would pack up each fall and move inland to the area of Go Home Lake which was more protected, to live out the winter months. When asked where they were going by the Voyageurs, they would reply Kewa, which meant \\"Go Home\\" in their native language, hence the name for both the Bay on Georgian Bay, the river and the Lake. Go Home Lake is approximately long and ranges from 1/2 to 3/4 miles (800 - 1,200 m) wide. Of Muskoka's 1600 lakes, it is the 14th biggest by size. Its length runs in a north–south orientation. The lake is fed at its most northern point by the Musquash River. It then empties back into the Musquash River through a control dam at the south end of the lake, and into Go Home River at the north end of the lake. Both the Musquash and Go Home Rivers empty into Georgian Bay. Go Home Lake is considerably more rugged and rockier than other Muskoka lakes. Both the \\"New Cut\\" (a man made channel), and the \\"Haunted Narrows\\" link the south end of the lake to the north. The \\"Haunted Narrows\\" received its name from the eerie sound caused by the movement of rocks on the bottom of the channel that can be heard in the dead of night due to the strong current flow. There are approximately 430 cottages on Go Home Lake, the vast majority of which are water-access, as well as two marinas. The closest marina to the Hwy. 400 exit is Minor's Bay marina, which is built upon the location originally called 'Potter's Landing' in the 1950s. The further marina from the Hwy. 400 exit is Go Home Lake Marina. While both marinas offer dockage, parking, boat launching, only Go Home Lake Marina has a general store with refueling facilities to cottagers. Minor's Bay marina also has a public telephone, as well as marine mechanical services. The Go Home fire tower once stood on the NW side of the lake overlooking Go Home Bay. It was one of the last manned towers used in Southern Ontario and came under the jurisdiction of the Parry Sound Fire District in the early 1970s when the Ministry of Natural Resources was once called the Dept. of Lands and Forests. Recreational activities are popular on this lake, including: fishing, canoeing, cliff-diving, water-skiing, wakeboarding, tubing as well as the annual regatta. ==See also== *List of lakes in Ontario ==References== Category:Lakes of the District Municipality of Muskoka ","title":"Go Home Lake"},{"id":"3237897","text":"Moulis may refer to: ==Places== * Moulis, Ariège, a French commune in the department of Ariège * Moulis, Tarn-et-Garonne, an ancient French commune in Tarn-et-Garonne, today part of Reyniès * Moulis-en-Médoc, French commune in the department of Gironde ==People== * Danny Moulis (born 1960), Australian footballer * Pavel Moulis (born 1991), Czech footballer ==Other uses== * Moulis-en-Médoc AOC, a red wine appellation in Bordeaux, situated around the commune Moulis-en-Médoc ==See also== * Mouli (disambiguation) oc:Molins (Arièja) ","title":"Moulis"},{"id":"3237908","text":"\\"Prisoner of Society\\" is a song by Australian punk rock band The Living End.

Branch and cut involves running a branch and bound algorithm and using cutting planes to tighten the linear programming relaxations. Note that if cuts are only used to tighten the initial LP relaxation, the algorithm is called cut and branch. ==Algorithm== This description assumes the ILP is a maximization problem. The method solves the linear program without the integer constraint using the regular simplex algorithm. When an optimal solution is obtained, and this solution has a non- integer value for a variable that is supposed to be integer, a cutting plane algorithm may be used to find further linear constraints which are satisfied by all feasible integer points but violated by the current fractional solution. These inequalities may be added to the linear program, such that resolving it will yield a different solution which is hopefully \\"less fractional\\". At this point, the branch and bound part of the algorithm is started. The problem is split into multiple (usually two) versions. The new linear programs are then solved using the simplex method and the process repeats. During the branch and bound process, non-integral solutions to LP relaxations serve as upper bounds and integral solutions serve as lower bounds. A node can be pruned if an upper bound is lower than an existing lower bound. Further, when solving the LP relaxations, additional cutting planes may be generated, which may be either global cuts, i.e., valid for all feasible integer solutions, or local cuts, meaning that they are satisfied by all solutions fulfilling the side constraints from the currently considered branch and bound subtree. The algorithm is summarized below. #Add the initial ILP to L, the list of active problems #Set x^* = \\\\text{null} and v^* = -\\\\infty #while L is not empty ##Select and remove (de-queue) a problem from L ##Solve the LP relaxation of the problem. ##If the solution is infeasible, go back to 3 (while). Otherwise denote the solution by x with objective value v. ##If v\\\\le v^*, go back to 3. ##If x is integer, set v^*\\\\leftarrow v, x^* \\\\leftarrow x and go back to 3. ##If desired, search for cutting planes that are violated by x. If any are found, add them to the LP relaxation and return to 3.2. ##Branch to partition the problem into new problems with restricted feasible regions. Add these problem to L and go back to 3 #return x^* === Pseudocode === In C++-like pseudocode, this could be written: // ILP branch and cut solution pseudocode, assuming objective is to be maximized ILP_solution branch_and_cut_ILP(IntegerLinearProgram initial_problem) { queue active_list; // L, above active_list.enqueue(initial_problem); // step 1 // step 2 ILP_solution optimal_solution; // this will hold x* above double best_objective = -std::numeric_limits::infinity; // will hold v* above while (!active_list.empty()) { // step 3 above LinearProgram& curr_prob = active_list.dequeue(); // step 3.1 do { // steps 3.2-3.7 RelaxedLinearProgram& relaxed_prob = LP_relax(curr_prob); // step 3.2 LP_solution curr_relaxed_soln = LP_solve(relaxed_prob); // this is x above bool cutting_planes_found = false; if (!curr_relaxed_soln.is_feasible()) { // step 3.3 continue; // try another solution; continues at step 3 } double current_objective_value = curr_relaxed_soln.value(); // v above if (current_objective_value <= best_objective) { // step 3.4 continue; // try another solution; continues at step 3 } if (curr_relaxed_soln.is_integer()) { // step 3.5 best_objective = current_objective_value; optimal_solution = cast_as_ILP_solution(curr_relaxed_soln); continue; // continues at step 3 } // current relaxed solution isn't integral if (hunting_for_cutting_planes) { // step 3.6 violated_cutting_planes = search_for_violated_cutting_planes(curr_relaxed_soln); if (!violated_cutting_planes.empty()) { // step 3.6 cutting_planes_found = true; // will continue at step 3.2 for (auto&& cutting_plane : violated_cutting_planes) { active_list.enqueue(LP_relax(curr_prob, cutting_plane)); } continue; // continues at step 3.2 } } // step 3.7: either violated cutting planes not found, or we weren't looking for them auto&& branched_problems = branch_partition(curr_prob); for (auto&& branch : branched_problems) { active_list.enqueue(branch); } continue; // continues at step 3 } while (hunting_for_cutting_planes /* parameter of the algorithm; see 3.6 */ && cutting_planes_found); // end step 3.2 do-while loop } // end step 3 while loop return optimal_solution; // step 4 } In the above pseudocode, the functions \`LP_relax\`, \`LP_solve\` and \`branch_partition\` called as subroutines must be provided as applicable to the problem. For example, \`LP_solve\` could call the simplex algorithm. Branching strategies for \`branch_partition\` are discussed below. ==Branching strategies== An important step in the branch and cut algorithm is the branching step. At this step, there are a variety of branching heuristics that can be used. The branching strategies described below all involve what is called branching on a variable. Branching on a variable involves choosing a variable, x_i, with a fractional value, x_i', in the optimal solution to the current LP relaxation and then adding the constraints x_i \\\\le \\\\left\\\\lfloor x_i' \\\\right\\\\rfloor and x_i \\\\ge \\\\left\\\\lceil x_i' \\\\right\\\\rceil ; Most infeasible branching: This branching strategy chooses the variable with the fractional part closest to 0.5. ; Pseudo cost branching: The basic idea of this strategy is to keep track for each variable x_i the change in the objective function when this variable was previously chosen as the variable to branch on. The strategy then chooses the variable that is predicted to have the most change on the objective function based on past changes when it was chosen as the branching variable. Note that pseudo cost branching is initially uninformative in the search since few variables have been branched on. ; Strong branching: Strong branching involves testing which of the candidate variable gives the best improvement to the objective function before actually branching on them. Full strong branching tests all candidate variables and can be computationally expensive. The computational cost can be reduced by only considering a subset of the candidate variables and not solving each of the corresponding LP relaxations to completion. There are also a large number of variations of these branching strategies, such as using strong branching early on when pseudo cost branching is relatively uninformative and then switching to pseudo cost branching later when there is enough branching history for pseudo cost to be informative. ==References== ==External links== * Mixed Integer Programming * SCIP: framework for branch- cut-and-price and a mixed integer programming solver * ABACUS – A Branch-And- CUt System – open source software * COIN-OR Cbc – open source software on GitHub Category:Combinatorial optimization Category:Optimization algorithms and methods ","title":"Branch and cut"},{"id":"3237919","text":"Earls Barton is a village and civil parish in Northamptonshire, notable for its Anglo-Saxon church and shoe-making heritage. The village is in the Borough of Wellingborough. At the time of the 2011 census, the population was 5,387. Earls Barton is renowned for its remarkable Anglo-Saxon heritage.Office for National Statistics: Earls Barton CP: Parish headcounts Retrieved 16 July 2015. ==History== The original Anglo-Saxon village was known as Bere-tun, or \\"a place for growing Barley\\", and was one of several Spring line settlements constructed along the north bank of the River Nene. Immediately prior to 1066, it was held by Bondi the staller, an Anglo-Danish noble, and senior member of Edward the Confessor's household; around 1070, it passed to Waltheof, Earl of Northumbria. In 1070, he married Judith of Lens, niece of William the Conqueror, recorded in the Domesday Book as owner of the land and mill of Buarton(e). He was made Earl of Northampton in 1071; it is thought these links, and those with the Earl of Huntingdon, later gave the village its prefix \\"Earls\\". In The King's England: Northamptonshire, edited by Arthur Mee, it notes: Architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner disagrees with this assessment, describing it as: He goes on to argue that the castle was founded at the time of the Norman conquest of England and its builder ignored the then existing church, leaving it in its bailey, for a later demolition that never happened. In the 13th century, shoes began to be made from leather bought in nearby Northampton, while the village also had its own tanyard, which remained in operation until 1984. During the 14th and 15th centuries, sheep shearing gave way to the manufacture of woollen cloth, which remained a major cottage industry until the shift to the newly industrialised north several centuries later. Census data shows that from 1801 to 1850, the village population grew from 729 to over 2,000. In 1880, the Barker shoe company was founded in Earls Barton, and remains there to the present day. Between 1913 and 1921, ironstone was produced in two local quarries; the first, situated north of Doddington Road, began operations in 1913, the second in 1916, west of Wellingborough Road. A 3 foot gauge tramway connected both quarries to the northern terminal of the gas-powered aerial ropeway, where the ore was loaded into buckets. It was then taken across the River Nene to Castle Ashby and Earls Barton station, and dumped into railway wagons. The tramway initially used horses, until a steam locomotive was bought in 1914 to replace them. Quarrying was at first done by hand, using explosives, then steam diggers were used from 1918. In 1925 the original quarry was reopened, not for iron ore, but for the obtaining of gannister (white silica sand). A new 2 foot gauge tramway was used to take the sand to Wellingborough Road where it was loaded into lorries for dispatch. This tramway used a small diesel locomotive. It is not clear how long gannister was quarried but the quarry still appears to have been in use in 1949 and a rusty quarry machine was in situ in the 1970s. The quarried area has mostly been built on but some traces of the system remain including part of a final gullet north of Doddington Road and the remains of a bridge in that road. The remains of the tipping point from the tramway to the ropeway can be seen from Dowthorpe Hill and Milbury. ==Parish church== The Anglo-Saxon Church at Earls Barton The Church of England parish church of All Saints has been a feature of the village for many centuries. Its Anglo-Saxon tower dates to ca 970 AD. Pevsner says that the church tower as built was not originally followed by a nave, but a chancel. He also describes the tower's bell openings as being very unusual - having five narrow arches each on turned balusters. All Saints' underwent two phases of Norman enlargement, one at either end of the 12th century. Other notable features include: *a Norman or Anglo-Saxon door and arcading on the western end of the building - this was the original entrance to the church, *a medieval rood screen, *a Victorian font and pews, and *a modern 20th-century inner porch and windows Apart from the Saxon tower, the church is mainly built from Northamptonshire ironstone and limestone, while the tower was constructed from Barnack stone and infilled with local limestone. Another feature is that every century from the 10th century onwards is represented in either the fabric or the fittings of the church building. It is decorated with the work of the local artist Henry Bird.Times (29 April 2000) Henry Bird, Obituary The Times The church was featured on a 1972 postage stamp issued by the Royal Mail, as part of a set depicting village churches.http://www.collectgbstamps.co.uk/explore/issues/?issue=115 There are three other churches in Earls Barton: Methodist, Baptist and Roman Catholic. Another Anglo-Saxon church can be found nearby in Brixworth. The Methodist Church is on Broad Street; the church building is over 200 years old and is home to many village groups including the 1st Earls Barton Boy's Brigade, badminton club and wives group. ==Miscellany== The village was the inspiration for the film Kinky Boots and part of the film was shot here. It is based on the true story of a local boot factory which turned from Dr Marten's, their own Provider brand and traditional boots to producing fetish footwear in order to save the ailing family business and the jobs of his workers. The village has a history of ingenious industry including the Barker's shoe factory, a woven label company, and the White & Co factory that produced Tredair and Dr Marten's boots until 2003. In the village's small market square there is a pharmacy run by a member of the Jeyes chemist's family, which family invented and manufactured Jeyes Fluid. The family also ran the Philadelphus Jeyes chemist chain and lived nearby at Holly Lodge in Boughton. Earls Barton is renowned for its 'Dr Fright's Night' halloween shows hosted at White's Farm and is popular with neighbouring villages and towns. In snowy conditions Kensit's field becomes a popular attraction for sledgers due to its steep hill. After a change in policy regarding public libraries by Northamptonshire County Council, in 2019/2020 the local community took over the running of the village library. ==Local sport== The village has a cricket team. The exact date that this club was established is unknown however there has been cricket in Earls Barton since the late 19th century. The club at present has two teams that play in the Northamptonshire Cricket League. It also has Kwik Cricket, U11's, U13's, U15 and U17's teams. The local football team, Earls Barton FC was formed in the late 19th century - with the exact date now not known. When Northampton Town FC (The Cobblers) was first formed in 1897, their first game was against Earls Barton United (EBU) on 18 September 1897. The final score Cobblers 4 - EBU 1. Currently Earls Barton United Football Club compete in the Premier Division of the Northants Combination, which is at Step 7 of the English non-league pyramid. Earls Barton Stadium was a greyhound racing and speedway stadium on Station Road just south of the village. It operated from the 1940s until the 1970s and also hosted Go Karting and Banger racing. \\"Earls Barton Motors\\" was home to Britain's 1957 stock car World Champion, Aubrey Leighton, who was a recognised innovator and builder of stock cars, as well as a racer. ==Neighbourhood Plan== In 2012 the Parish Council asked for volunteers to investigate and develop a Neighbourhood Plan following the introduction of the Localism Act. A Project Group made up of local residents, elected members and a project manager with experience of planning was formed and met monthly. Following an appropriate framework, the group worked with the village residents to produce a Plan, which Was adopted after an appropriate referendum was held and accepted the adoption of the plan. The plan was submitted to the Borough Council of Wellingborough for examination and a local referendum overwhelmingly supported the plan and its adoption. This led to the Borough Council of Wellingborough integrating the Plan into planning consideration for the next twenty years. ==Commerce and Trade== In April 2017, the closure of the last branch of a bank or building society within the village was announced. Market Harborough Building Society (MHBS) wrote to customers announcing the closure of the branch located in Jeyes of Earls Barton, stating the new 'local' branches are in Kettering or Rothwell. MHBS cited lack of footfall and transactions as people undertake more banking online as the main reason for the branch closure. In 2016 the Post Office in the village, a local sorting office and main Post Office, closed and a small branch counter opened in the Premier store on Station Road. Any collection of mail moved to the Northampton main sorting office from the branch . The closure or significant change of these branches presented the end of an era for Earls Barton; in recent history the village was home to branches of the Nationwide Building Society, Midland Bank, Barclays Bank and Lloyds Bank. In the run-up before Christmas 2016, The Old Swan closed for refurbishment and was re-opened by a local landlord; around the same period, the Saxon Tavern opened in the old Lloyds Bank branch next to E Lee Butchers on The Square. Whilst these two establishments have grown and attracted more customers, The Stag on Wellingborough Road temporarily closed and as of April 2016 has a temporary manager in place. In 2020, during the health crisis the UK found itself within, The Old Swan provided free stew to the community funded by off- sales with home delivery. The joint landlord, Paul Dexter, was interviewed by local media and the service was mentioned on BBC One's The One Show. White's Nursery operates a market shop and show grounds, with a planning application to redevelop the retail parts of the site to increase retail space. The show grounds host annual and more frequent events such as Car Shows. ==Community life== *1st Earls Barton Boys Brigade *Badminton Club *Earls Barton Fire Station *Earls Barton Historical Society *Earls Barton Primary School *Earls Barton Library *Earls Barton Museum of Village Life *Earls Barton Music *Earls Barton Parish Council *Earls Barton Tennis Club *Earls Barton Youth Club *Saxon Pre-School *Starfruit Youth Theatre Company *Under The Tower - Drama Group *Pied Piper Pre-School *Earls Barton Carnival *Earls Barton Soap Box Derby ==Pictures== Image:Earls Barton village, Northamptonshire, UK.jpgEarls Barton Village centre Image:Earls Barton parish church, Northamptonshire, UK.jpgEarls Barton Church Image:SaxonDoor.JPGThe Old Church Door ==References== ==Sources== * * * ==External links== *Parish Council website *Northants County Guides: Earls Barton Category:Villages in Northamptonshire Category:Tourist attractions in Northamptonshire Category:Grade II listed buildings in Northamptonshire Category:Wellingborough Category:Civil parishes in Northamptonshire ","title":"Earls Barton"},{"id":"3237920","text":"Mordicai Gerstein (November 24, 1935 - September 24, 2019) was an American artist, writer, and film director, best known for illustrating and writing children's books.

The exhaust manifold is configured in such a way that positive and negative pulses are produced during the operation of the cycle by designing it as a diffuser. The ASV has three openings: one is connected to the manifold vacuum, another is connected to the exhaust pipe and the third is open to the atmosphere. When a negative pulse is induced in the exhaust, air from the atmosphere enters the exhaust manifold through a one-way reed valve and serves to oxidize the carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons in the exhaust. ==Air cut valve system== This system consists of a spring-loaded diaphragm, and a shaft which is attached to the bottom. A manifold vacuum is applied over the diaphragm where the shaft end is towards the opening of the atmosphere. During deceleration, the engine vacuum rises and acts against the spring to push the shaft downwards, thereby blocking the opening through which atmospheric air is passed to the exhaust. Though there is a negative pulse during deceleration, the manifold vacuum blocks and cuts off the air to the exhaust manifold. Used on the Honda Falcon NX4, mainly responsible for backfire or popping during deceleration when an open exhaust is added to the bike and if extra accessories is on vacuum circuit (Scottoiler, etc.). This system is mainly used in Indian two wheeler which are manufactured by Hero Honda. The advantage of this system is low cost. ==Pulsed Air Valve== The Royal Enfield Bullet, from year 2006-current, uses an Air Suction Valve to reduce emissions in its exhaust gases. Royal Enfield Motors calls their Air Suction Valve the PAV, or Pulsed Air Valve. Its function is the same, using a vacuum at the intake to trigger a valve that pulses atmospheric air into the exhaust. The original \\"iron barrel\\" style engine did this with a hose from the PAV going to the exhaust pipe, the newer (2003–2009) AVL aluminum engine pulses the gas directly into the exhaust port on the head of the engine itself.

Lorne joins them and a discussion arises about Angel, who is upstairs alone. As they continue to discuss whether Angel would actually kill Wesley, Cordelia returns to the hotel with Groo in tow. The sight of her friends quickly dampens her mood. Upstairs, a depressed Angel watches Connor's crib. At a demon-populated casino, a demon by the name of Jenoff meets with another, the \\"Repo-Man.\\" The Repo-Man is given instructions to collect someone's soul and hands over a card to Angel Investigations to guide the collection demon. Back at the hotel, the next day, Angel rests silently in his room. Lorne packs Wesley's belongings into boxes while Groo tries to carry on a conversation about the recent events affecting the agency and group of friends. Meanwhile, a couple of elderly demons talk with Gunn and Fred about their case. They explain that there is an uninvited demon staying at their lair, then begin to bicker. Gunn recognizes the type of demon, a Skench, and agrees to battle the phlegm projecting demon to rid the couple of their problem. Gunn and Fred admire the couple's long relationship while Groo appreciates Fred and Gunn's concern for each other. Lorne leaves for a private reading while Fred takes the box of Wesley's belongings to him at the hospital. There, she fills him in on the whole story and everyone's knowledge of his true motivations as well as their feelings of betrayal. She reveals that the prophecy was a fake and warns him never to return to the hotel or Angel really will kill him. Gunn investigates the demon lair and finds the grotesque Skench demon. He fights with the demon and eventually manages to slay it without getting hit by phlegm. His luck changes however when the Repo-Man appears at the lair after receiving directions from Groo at the hotel. Seven years before, Gunn visited Jenoff at the casino and assuming he didn't have a future, sacrificed it in exchange for something he wanted badly. The Repo-Man advises Gunn that since Gunn was preparing to offer his soul to a girl (Fred), Jenoff wanted to ensure he collected before that happened. Gunn is given 24 hours to show up at the casino to pay and any failure to go through with it will not only cost Gunn his soul, but also Fred's. Back at the hotel, Gunn is disconnected and preoccupied with his thoughts, which Cordelia picks up on. She assumes he's feeling guilty about being happy with Fred when Angel's so down, and advises him to enjoy life and seize the day. The following day, Gunn follows that advice and brings Fred breakfast in bed and announces he has planned the day for them to spend together. A doctor at the hospital informs Wesley that he'll be released soon, and asks if he has anyone who can pick him up. Wesley is left with the stark reality that he has no friends left. Angel muses over Connor. Gunn treats Fred to a fun day all over town, with excessive amounts of her favorite foods. Fred gets tired and full of food and then realizes that something is wrong with Gunn because he's trying to live the day like it's his last. She pressures him for the truth and he explodes. He throws insults and rudeness at her and ends their relationship brutally, leaving Fred in tears. Back at the hotel, Cordelia is distracted by crying that she hears out in the hallway. A tearful Fred stands out in the hallway and tells them there's something wrong with Gunn. Meanwhile, Gunn shows up at the casino to pay his debt to Jenoff. Fred tries to explain the situation with Gunn, but her story is confusing to the others. Trusting Fred's judgment, Angel assures his friends that they will rescue Gunn as the family will not be losing another member. As they plan to search for Gunn, Groo reveals a business card from the Repo-Man and tells the gang about the demon's visit. Just before Jenoff can suck Gunn's soul, Angel and the gang break into the casino and start fighting the demons. Gunn is detained and dozens of demons surround the gang. Angel puts his soul on the line along with Gunn's in order to get Jenoff to agree to a challenge. Angel instructs Cordelia to stake him quickly if he loses, and she assures him she will. Jenoff allows Angel to pick the game and he suggests the winner be determined by cutting the deck for a high card. His plan doesn't work however and he loses the game. Cordelia reacts quickly and stakes Jenoff's hand to the table while Angel decapitates him. Gunn breaks free, but he knows the terror is not over as the parasitic soul-sucking creature within Jenoff's body emerges from where his head was and starts emitting horrible, high-pitched screams. Thinking quickly, Angel questions whether anyone else in the crowd is in Jenoff's debt and the customers all jump on Jenoff while the Angel Investigations team escapes. In his truck, Gunn apologizes repeatedly to Fred for breaking up with her and she accepts after many repetitions. With her prompting, he reveals that he traded his soul not for a girl, but for his truck, which served him and his fellow vampire hunters (first seen in \\"War Zone\\") well in their years of protecting their neighborhood; at the time, he valued such a resource far more than his life, since he presumed he would be killed in action long before Jenoff could claim his soul anyway. At the hotel, Angel begins to dismantle the crib in his bedroom. ==Production details== ===Arc significance=== * Angel is put back in charge of Angel Investigations after the fallout between Wesley and the rest of the team. * Angel accepts that Connor is gone, that he is never coming back, and that he did everything he could to bring him back. ===Continuity=== * Gunn's demon clients assure him there are no such things as leprechauns. This is a running gag in the Buffyverse: In Faith, Hope and Trick, Buffy tells Giles \\"There are two things I don't believe in: coincidence and leprechauns,\\" and Giles concurs that, as far as he knows, she is correct about the latter. In Unleashed, Gunn sarcastically asks evil restaurateur Crane if he serves (as food, not as patrons) leprechauns along with werewolves, and Crane disdainfully informs him that leprechauns do not exist. * In an earlier episode, Guise Will Be Guise, Gunn, having rarely ventured out of the neighborhood he had sworn to protect from vampires, expressed surprise upon learning of Los Angeles' hidden demon community and its haunts, such as Caritas. However, this episode depicts him, in flashback, visiting precisely such an establishment, Jenoff's casino, long before meeting Angel and company. ===Music=== *\\"Gangsta's Paradise\\" by Coolio (featuring L.V.). ==External links== * * Category:Angel (season 3) episodes Category:2002 American television episodes ","title":"Double or Nothing (Angel)"},{"id":"3237947","text":"František Xaver Brixi (2 January 1732 – 14 October 1771) was a Czech classical composer of the 18th century. His first name is sometimes given by reference works in its Germanic form, Franz. ==Biography== Brixi was born in Prague, the son of composer Šimon Brixi. He received his musical education at the Piarist Gymnasium in Kosmonosy. His teachers included Václav Kalous, a significant composer himself. In 1749 Brixi left Kosmonosy and returned to Prague, where he worked as an organist at several churches. In 1759 he was appointed Kapellmeister of St Vitus Cathedral, thus attaining, at age 27, the highest musical position in the city; this office he held till his early death. He wrote some 290 church works (of the most varied type), cantatas and oratorios, chamber compositions, and orchestral compositions. He was a prolific composer of music for the liturgy, and wrote more than 100 masses, vespers and motets, among others. He also composed secular music such as oratorios and incidental music, concertos and symphonies. His organ concertos, which have been recorded several times each, are his best-known pieces today. ==Style== Brixi was an important composer at the junction between Baroque and the Classical period. Brixi's style is distinguished from that of his contemporaries by its fresh melodic writing, vivacious rhythm and lively bass lines, and from that of his predecessors by its simple yet effective instrumentation. During his lifetime his music was widely disseminated in Bohemia and Moravia. ==Influence== Brixi's music made Prague's people receptive for Mozart's music (where Mozart was in high esteem even during times where he was shunned elsewhere). ==Selected compositions== * Missa integra in d minor * Missa aulica, missa brevis in C * Opus patheticum de septem doloribus Beatae Mariae Virginis * Organ Concerto in D major * Organ Concerto in F major * Judas Iscariothes - Oratorium pro die sacro Parasceves * Missa solemnis in D major - mass for solo, choir, orchestra and organ * Litanie de seto Benedieto * Confiteor tibi Domine * Sinfonia in D * Bitevní sinfonie * Fuga in A minor * Pastoral in C major * Preludium In C major * Regina coeli ==References== ==External links== * František Brixi * Category:1732 births Category:1771 deaths Category:Musicians from Prague Category:Czech classical composers Category:Czech male classical composers Category:Classical-period composers Category:Czech classical organists Category:Male organists Category:18th- century Bohemian musicians Category:18th-century classical composers Category:18th-century male musicians Category:18th-century keyboardists ","title":"František Brixi"},{"id":"3237955","text":"The Indian National Mathematical Olympiad (INMO) is a high school mathematics competition held annually in India since 1989. It is the third tier in the Indian team selection procedure for the International Mathematical Olympiad and is conducted by the Homi Bhabha Centre for Science Education (HBCSE) under the aegis of the National Board of Higher Mathematics (NBHM). ==Eligibility and participant selection process== The INMO is conducted by the MO Cell which is held on the third Sunday of January at 30 centers across the country. Prospective candidates first need to write the Pre-Regional Mathematical Olympiad(known as PRMO) then the Regional Mathematical Olympiad of their respective state or region. Around thirty students are selected from each region, to write the INMO. The best-performing students from the RMO (approximately 900) qualify for the second stage INMO. ===Restrictions on senior year students=== About 6 top-performing students in RMO studying in the twelfth grade from each region are permitted to give INMO. ==Structure of the examination== The INMO examination paper comprises six problems to be solved over a time of four hours. These problems are in the areas of Algebra, Geometry, Number theory and Combinatorics, Graph Theory. No calculator is allowed. ==Further stages== ===The International Mathematical Olympiad Training Camp (IMOTC)=== The qualifying students are invited to the International Mathematical Olympiad Training Camp (IMOTC), a one-month mathematics camp hosted by the Homi Bhabha Centre for Science Education in Mumbai. For first time participants, it usually extends from late April till the end of May, while it begins about 10-14 days later for senior participants. In this camp, the students are taught Olympiad mathematics and some other general mathematics. Four selection tests and two practice tests are held during this period and the top six students in the selection tests qualify to represent India in the International Mathematical Olympiad. ===Pre- departure Training Camp for IMO=== The selected team of 6 students goes through another round of training and orientation for about 10 days prior to departure for IMO. ===International Mathematical Olympiad=== The six member team selected at the end of IMOTC accompanied by a leader, a deputy leader and an observer represents the country at the IMO, held in July each year in a different member country of the IMO. Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) finances international travel of the team, the leader and the deputy leader, while NBHM(DAE) finances the other expenditure connected with the international participation and the entire in-country programme. ===Post-IMOTC training of qualified candidates for subsequent seasons=== Students who qualify the INMO once and come to attend the IMO Training Camp are sent postal problems during the period July -- December that they have to solve and send back (if they are still in school). Based on their responses, some of the students are invited to the IMO Training Camp the next year directly. Others have to rewrite the INMO again (they do not have to write the Regional Mathematics Olympiad). From 2021, postals have been scrapped and all students(including Senior batch) have to give INMO to be eligible for attending IMOTC. ==Perks upon qualification== * Students qualifying the INMO are automatically eligible for admission to the B.Sc. (Hons) Mathematics course in the Chennai Mathematical Institute. * Since 2008, INMO awardees applying for B. Stat or B. Math courses of the Indian Statistical Institute are directly called for the interview without having to write the written test. * INMO awardees are also eligible for an NBHM scholarship that currently stands at about Rs. 2500 per month, if they continue their studies in mathematics. They are also offered a 4-year programme of training in Mathematics through correspondence and periodic contact with a chosen faculty. The programme is also available to INMO awardees who do not pursue an undergraduate degree in Mathematics but have special interest in the subject. They are offered an annual cash award of Rs. 9,000 subject to satisfactory performance in the programme. * Students who make it to the IMO are eligible for the Kishore Vaigyanik Protsahan Yojana (KVPY) fellowship provided they pursue their studies in the science subjects in India. The fellowship amount stands at Rs. 5000 per month. * Indian team members who receive a gold, silver or bronze at IMO are given cash awards by the NBHM of Rs. 5,000, Rs. 4,000 and Rs. 3,000 respectively. * All travel expenses for the IMO Training Camp and all expenses for the IMO are borne by the Ministry of HRD, Government of India. ==See also== * International Mathematical Olympiad * Junior Science Talent Search Examination ==External links== * Information on RMO and INMO provided by Bhaskaracharya Pratishthana * Indian National Mathematical Olympiad problems * NBHM official page on Olympiads * Official page of the MO cell * Mathematics Olympiad Help Site - India * Science Olympiad * Mathematics Olympiad Multiple Choice Questions * HBCSE Mathematical Olympiad page * Math Olympiad in India - A Comprehensive Guide ==References== Category:International Mathematical Olympiad ","title":"Indian National Mathematical Olympiad"},{"id":"3237961","text":"Denniston road The Waimangaroa River is located on the West Coast of New Zealand.

Other symptoms include increased sweating, salivation, bronchial secretions along with miosis (constricted pupils). This crisis may be masked by the concomitant use of atropine along with cholinesterase inhibitor in order to prevent side effects. Flaccid paralysis resulting from cholinergic crisis can be distinguished from myasthenia gravis by the use of the drug edrophonium (Tensilon) as it only worsens the paralysis caused by cholinergic crisis but strengthens the muscle in the case of myasthenia gravis. (Edrophonium is an cholinesterase inhibitor hence increases the concentration of acetylcholine present). It is useful to remember some of the symptoms of increased cholinergic stimulation that include: * Salivation: stimulation of the salivary glands * Lacrimation: stimulation of the lacrimal glands (tearing) * Urination: relaxation of the internal sphincter muscle of urethra, and contraction of the detrusor muscles * Defecation * Gastrointestinal distress: Smooth muscle tone changes causing gastrointestinal problems, including cramping * Emesis: Vomiting * Miosis constriction of the pupils of the eye via stimulation of the pupillary constrictor muscles * Muscle spasm: stimulation of skeletal muscle (due to nicotinic acetylcholine receptor stimulation) ==Cause== Cholinergic crisis, sometimes known by the mnemonic \\"SLUDGE syndrome\\" ( Salivation, Lacrimation, Urination, Defecation, Gastrointestinal Distress and Emesis), can be a consequence of: * Contamination with - or excessive exposure to - certain chemicals including: **nerve agents, (e.g. sarin, VX, Novichok agents). **organophosphorus insecticides (e.g. parathion) **nicotine poisoning can also present with similar symptoms, as it also involves excessive parasympathetic stimulation. * Ingestion of certain poisonous fungi (particularly the muscarine-containing members of the genera Amanita, Inocybe and Clitocybe). *In medicine, this is seen in patients with myasthenia gravis who take too high a dose of medications such as cholinesterase inhibitors, or seen following general anaesthesia, when too high a dose of a cholinesterase inhibitor drug is given to reverse surgical muscle paralysis. == Treatment == Some elements of the cholinergic crisis can be treated with antimuscarinic drugs like atropine or diphenhydramine, but the most important element, respiratory arrest, cannot. The neuromuscular junction, where the brain communicates with muscles (like the diaphragm, the main breathing muscle), works by acetylcholine activating nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and leading to muscle contraction. Atropine only blocks muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (a different subtype than the nicotinic receptors at the neuromuscular junction), so atropine will not improve the muscle strength and ability to breathe in someone with cholinergic crisis. Such a patient will require neuromuscular blocking drugs and mechanical ventilation support via endotracheal intubation until the crisis resolves on its own. The respiratory compromise from cholinergic crisis unfortunately has no less invasive intervention. == See also == * Physostigmine ==References== Category:Toxicology Category:Neurotransmitters Category:Parasympathomimetics Category:Medicinal chemistry Category:Medical mnemonics ","title":"Cholinergic crisis"},{"id":"3237968","text":"Prince of Foxes is a 1947 historical novel by Samuel Shellabarger, following the adventures of the fictional Andrea Orsini, a captain in the service of Cesare Borgia during his conquest of the Romagna. ==Plot introduction== Andrea Zoppo, an Italian peasant schooled in the arts and versed in the ways of nobility during his University years, loses his old identity during the French invasion of Florence, and becomes Andrea Orsini, a bastard member of a dead Neapolitan junior branch of the great house of Orsini. Having made his name with the French forces, he takes service with Cesare Borgia, with dreams of uniting Italy to stop the depredations of foreign adventurers and the manipulations of France and the Holy Roman Empire. However, his love of Lady Camilla of the Bagliones and respect for her husband Lord Varano of Citta del Monte derail those plans when he is sent to their court to take the city by treachery. ==Plot summary== The novel begins with Andrea on the verge of embarking from Venice on his first non-military mission for Borgia, to induce Alfonso d'Este, the heir of Ferrara, the \\"brightest court in Italy,\\" to marry Lucrezia Borgia, lately widowed, despite the numerous objections against the match on the grounds of state and taste. Orsini meets with an instrument maker and humanist to sell a certain painting he claims was taken during the fall of one of the cities of the Romagne. There he meets Camilla Varano, the wife of the lord of the fictional Citta del Monte, both of which have been promised to him by Borgia. There is a definite attraction between the two. The d'Estes, forced by Borgia to accept Andrea's service, do not wish to kill him in their demesne, and delegate the matter to their ambassador to Venice. He uses Mario Belli (Marius de Bella, lately of Savoy), erstwhile nobleman, traitor, and assassin of some repute. Mario fails, but, a true \\"modern,\\" turns his coat and offers information. Finding him intriguing and useful, Orsini spares him and offers him a place in his retinue. By force of his personality, Orsini overawes the d'Este ambassador and makes his way to Ferrara. On the journey, Belli secretly discovers Andrea's true heritage. In Ferrara, despite the interference of Duke Ercole d'Este and his impetuous son Cardinal Ippolito d'Este, and the resistance of the cannon-happy Alfonso d'Este, he accomplishes his mission, securing Alfonso's promises. Meanwhile, Orsini makes an enemy of the cardinal, befriends Belli's enemy Pierre de Bayard, paints a monastery, and falls deeper in love with Camilla, a guest of the d'Estes. Without knowledge of Andrea's success, the duke and cardinal send him to bring to Ferrara a living saint, Lucia Brocadelli of Narni, a woman whose stigmata are the talk of the region. Despite the Duke's earnest inducements and her willingness to go, the people of Viterbo will not release her. After a pleasant sojourn at the Citta del Monte, Orsini meets the saint, whose obvious piety deeply affects both him and Belli. In making his attempt to free her, Andrea is captured, but Belli succeeds, and Andrea talks his way out of the fracas. In Rome, the pope grants his niece, Angela, lady in waiting to Lucrezia, a betrothal to her former lover, Orsini, and reveals his plot against the Varanos, who will come to Rome for the Jubilee. Cesare, thinking his father's actions precipitous, arrives in Rome to stop the arrest and the betrothal. Orsini attempts to detach himself from the favor of his former lover, and has himself knifed for his trouble. Belli, distrusting the sovereigns and potions of the medicos and dottores, tends to the wound himself. With his contacts in the underworld, Belli interrupts Angela's attempt to assassinate her rival for Andrea's affection, and, in an unnerving interview with Cesare, he secures Camilla's safety. Borgia's conquest of the Marches had proceeded smoothly up to this point: his father, Pope Alexander VI, declared all his vicars in the region deposed and the citizens, largely seeing these rulers as cruel and petty, viewed Cesare Borgia as a great improvement when he eventually took power. In this way, Giovanni Sforza, first husband of Cesare's sister Lucrezia, was soon ousted from Pesaro; Pandolfo Malatesta lost Rimini and Faenza surrendered. But Borgia can only gain Citta del Monte through treachery, as low taxes and the love Varano's people bear him leave no obvious angles to stir up unrest, and Borgia cannot afford protracted warfare in the Marches. With Ferrara in alliance, he recalls his spy in Varano's court so that Orsini may take his place as captain of the guard, to suborn its people and assassinate its prince. At Citta del Monte, Orsini falls further from Cesare's orbit, taking Varano as his new role model. Varano is a man of noble character and vast military experience, having in his youth made his fortune as a captain in the mercenary army of the prince of Urbino, serving the Papal interest. This wealth has allowed him to adorn his court without oppressing his domain. With a new understanding of leadership and foregoing his dreams of an Italy united under a single personality, Orsini sets about to strengthen Citta del Monte against Cesare. When the ultimatum finally arrives, Varano asks his people whether he should stay and bring his city the miseries of protracted siege, or take himself into exile. They overwhelmingly reject Borgia and acclaim him. The Varanos also reject Borgia's claim that Orsini is the impostor Zoppo, embarrassing him. Belli, according to their contract, informs Orsini that he will leave his service for Borgia's. Despite a spirited defense of several months, Citta del Monte is left battered and bereft of its lord Varano, who dies of wounds incurred in the first attack. The walls breached beyond repair, the city prepares itself for its last defense, when Borgia, impatient, offers terms through his lieutenants. The terms are generous for a people so stubbornly set against him, but for one point: Zoppo must surrender himself. Despite Camilla's rejection of the terms, Orsini gives himself up in order to save her and the city. Borgia keeps his terms, stripping the valuables from the court, but leaving the city under Camilla and one of his Catalan adventurers. However, to embarrass the young widow, he parades Orsini before her after having starved him for weeks, proves his Zoppo identity by means of his peasant mother, and plans his execution. Belli, now a favored lieutenant of Borgia, is outraged: after all the losses Orsini has inflicted on Borgia, is mere execution to suffice? He offers to gouge out his former master's eyes before Camilla, Borgia, and the assembled captains, and, given leave, does so. Borgia, feigning pity, sends the blind peasant and his mother to wander the countryside, but sends Belli after them to \\"hurry them along.\\" Belli catches up to them, whereupon Orsini reveals the trick to his mother: Belli simulated the gouging using grape innards and blood from his hands. They plot to recover Citta del Monte. Belli returns to Camilla for funding, warning her that Borgia has granted the new city prefect the chance to win her through whatever means he deems necessary, including the torture of her townsfolk. She is to pretend madness to discourage these plans. Despite their careful plans, Orsini is recognized by Angela Borgia and the Cardinal d'Este while recruiting Swiss mercenaries and Pierre de Bayard. They reveal the plot to Borgia's captain, and spying on Orsini's interview with Camilla in the madhouse, discover how to stop the plot. Having suspected them, Orsini reveals that they have actually set the attack in motion. Bayard and the Swiss gain the walls as the city rises in revolt. Camilla gives the Catalan prefect to the people to avenge themselves upon, and Angela and d'Este are sent away. Months later, the pope is dead and Cesare, ill and left without patronage, has been captured and exiled by his enemies. Orsini is acclaimed by all as the model man of the Renaissance, married to Camilla, whose (anonymous) paintings excite the envy of Mantegna himself. ==Characters in \\"Prince of Foxes\\"== *Andrea Orsini, né Andrea Zoppo, who has made himself into a man of parts, skilled in intrigue, politics, and human nature *Mario Belli, an assassin, born Marius de Bella of Savoy, traitor to France, Andrea's ensign *Cesare Borgia, duke di Valentinois, lord of the Romagna, captain of the Papal forces *Lady Camilla Varano di Baglione *Lord Varano of Citta del Monte *Blessed Lucia Brocadelli of Narni, late of Viterbo, now of Ferrara ==Allusions/references to actual history and current science== *The conquest of the Romagna effected by Cesare Borgia is the backdrop for the events of the novel. *Pierre Terrail, seigneur de Bayard, the subject of one of Shellabarger's scholarly works (The Chevalier Bayard: A Study in Fading Chivalry), makes several appearances. *Andrea Mantegna makes a brief appearance. *The novel dramatizes the mediation between Alfonse d'Este and the Borgias to bring about his marriage to Lucrezia *The novel dramatizes how Ercole secured the Blessed Lucia of Narni from a jealous Viterbo *The novel dramatizes the murder of Lucrezia's second husband, Alfonso of Aragon (Duke of Bisceglie) *Zoppo is \\"cripple\\" in Italian.

Call It Courage is a story set in the Pacific Islands. It chronicles the journey of Mafatu, the son of the chief of Hikueru Island, Tavana Nui. Mafatu is afraid of the sea due to witnessing his mother die while he was a young child, which makes him a shame to his father, and referred to as a coward among his tribe. So one-night Mafatu takes a dugout canoe and sets sail into the ocean without knowing where he will end up. He is caught in a storm and the canoe is lost. He lands on a deserted island and learns to hunt and fish for himself, along with his companions Uri, a yellow dog, and Kivi, an albatross. Soon Mafatu finds a sacrificial altar built by cannibals from a neighboring island. Mafatu realizes he has inhabited the island for about a week and begins designing his escape by making a canoe. He gathers things he will need to survive a trip across the ocean. He finds a spear point on the terrible altar and uses it to hunt. After a number of encounters with natural foes, including a hammerhead shark, a wild boar, and an octopus, all of which he successfully kills, this is when he realizes he is gaining courage and learning to deal with the things that have frightened him. The cannibals return and he makes a daring escape from them, returning home at last to his village. The experience has transformed him into an imposing figure. His father does not recognize him at first, but then he proudly accepts him on his return. Mafatu's story is told throughout the ages to the future generations by his tribe's people.

A \\"bar\\" is a gold-bearing sandbar or sandy riverbank, and the one slightly down river and opposite today's town was populated heavily by Americans, who were known in the parlance of the Chinook Jargon as \\"Boston men\\" or simply \\"Bostons\\". A settlement developed on the east bank of the river to the north of the confluence with Anderson River. This was later moved to the present site with the construction of Canadian Northern Pacific Railway. The original Nlaka'pamux (Thompson Indian) name of Boston Bar was rendered in English-style spelling as Quayome, which appears commonly on frontier-era maps and in diaries and newspapers of the day. The name originally referred to the other side of the river from today's town, but came into use for the present site after the original was renamed North Bend by the Canadian Pacific Railway. In June 2011, Boston Bar briefly unofficially changed its name to \\"Vancouver Bar\\", in an effort to support the nearby Vancouver Canucks hockey team of the NHL in the Stanley Cup Finals as they took on the Boston Bruins. This follows major retailers such as Boston Pizza unofficially changing their name to \\"Vancouver Pizza\\" during the same round of the playoffs. Boston Bar is also the hometown to Mandeep Khara. Boston Bar ==North Bend== Across the Fraser River is the small town of North Bend, which could only be accessed by rail or by aerial ferry until January 1986 when the two lane bridge was built. The Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) has a small terminal here that is the half way point between Vancouver and Kamloops. The building of the railway played an important role in this region, first with the construction of the CPR line (1881–1885) then later the Canadian Northern Railway (today the Canadian National Railway) line on the Boston Bar side of the river. Boston Bar is a Canadian National Railway divisional point, where the Ashcroft Subdivision from Kamloops to Boston Bar joins the Yale Subdivision from Boston Bar to Vancouver. North Bend is also at the doorstep of the Nahatlatch Valley, a chain of three lakes and the Nahatlatch River. ==Climate== Boston Bar sits in a pocket climate created by the confines of the canyon, and though on the edge of the coastal temperate zone just to the south, its climate is subject to the seasonal extremes of temperature common in the interior of the province. It enjoys 4 very distinct seasons with temperatures reaching up to 35-40 °C in the summer and down to -5 to -10 °C in the winter. It is notably the first place inland up the Fraser Canyon where rainfall levels are markedly lower than the rainier stretches from Yale and Spuzzum north to Hell's Gate. The climate is transitional between marine west coast and continental. The heaviest precipitation occurs in winter, which also has the strongest marine influence in most years. The continental influence is most pronounced in summer, which is hot. The vegetation has a mixture of rain forest and dry interior plant species with bigleaf maple and western red cedar prominent among the rain forest species and ponderosa pine standing tall as one of the Interior species. Douglas-fir is the most common tree. Boston Bar is in the Interior Douglas-fir zone, wet warm subzone (IDFww). One consequence of the climate is that Boston Bar is in the range of the northern Pacific rattlesnake, which is common in areas farther upstream along the Fraser and Thompson Rivers, such as Lytton. Boston Bar has a warm-summer mediterranean climate (Csb). ==See also== *Boston Bar railway station *List of Chinook Jargon placenames ==References== Category:Unincorporated settlements in British Columbia Category:Populated places in the Fraser Valley Regional District Category:Fraser Canyon Category:Designated places in British Columbia Category:Chinook Jargon place names Category:Populated places on the Fraser River ","title":"Boston Bar, British Columbia"},{"id":"3237985","text":"Map of Ottawa with a dot indicating the location of Manor Park Manor Park is a neighbourhood in Rideau-Rockcliffe Ward in the east end of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada on the east side of Rockcliffe Park.http://www4.rncan.gc.ca/search- place-names/unique/FDKOA Its 2011 population was 3,295.http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/dp- pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1;=CT&Code1;=0894&Geo2;=CMA&Code2;=505&Data;=Count&SearchText;=&SearchType;=Begins&SearchPR;=01&B1;=All&Custom;= Its western boundary can be roughly defined as Birch Avenue, southern as Beechwood Cemetery, eastern as Aviation Parkway and northern as Ottawa River.

One of the entrances called \\"The Greyhound\\" was originally a historic Public House which closed in the early 1990s and incorporated into the building as an entrance. With the opening of Cabot Circus and the recession of 2008, many of the chain shops moved out of the Galleries and into the new Cabot Circus. This resulted in a large amount of empty shops and a decline of what was Bristol's main shopping centre from 1990s–2000s. ==Redevelopment== The shopping centre underwent a £1.5 million redevelopment to redevelop the entrances and to refurbish the mall as of March 2013.http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/Galleries-shopping-centre-entrance- receive-spruce/story-18541186-detail/story.html#ixzz2OpTvIfws Retrieved 7 April 2013.

Just downstream of the canyon, which pierces a rocky ridge, is a stretch of water called Scow Rapids, where towropes from the gorge's banks dragged vessels and rafts upstream. The canyon is located in the section of the Sugarbowl-Grizzly Den Provincial Park and Protected Area that is about 6km south-southwest of Hutton. This stretch of the river is commonly confused even by journalists with the much more impressive Fraser Canyon, which runs south from the city of Williams Lake to the town of Hope.https://theprovince.com/travel/grand+canyon+north+hidden/10177629/story.html ==History== The canyon head, 106 miles from Fort George via the Fraser,Fort George Herald: 21 Jan 1911; 15 Apr 1911; 20 May 1911; & 3 to 24 Jun 1913 progressed into dangerous rapids.Fort George Herald, 27 May 1911 In 1909, the Nechacco was the first sternwheeler to navigate the treacherous canyon.Fort George Tribune, 25 Jul 1914 During 1912–13, railway construction scows negotiated the canyon.

In 1916, he and his family moved to Milan where he attended the liceo classico Berchet. He enrolled at the Faculty of Law at the University of Pavia in 1921, and joined the Italian Socialist Party (PSI). He studied Marxist doctrine, and was close to Piero Gobetti during his Liberal Revolution phase. In his youth, Basso worked on Critica sociale, Il Caffè, Avanti!, Coscientia, Quarto Stato, and Pietre - which he directed in 1928, initially from Genoa, then from Milan. In 1925, he graduated in Law with a thesis on the concept of freedom in Marxist thought. In April 1928, Basso was arrested by the Fascist authorities in Milan and interned on the island of Ponza, where he studied for his degree in philosophy. He returned to Milan in 1931 and, while practising as a lawyer, graduated with a thesis on Rudolf Otto. In 1934 he once more took up politics as director of the Centro Interno Socialista, with Rodolfo Morandi, Lucio Luzzatto and Eugenio Colorni. This work was interrupted by his imprisonment in the internment camp in Colfiorito (Province of Perugia) from 1939 to 1940. ==In the Resistance and the early Italian Republic== After lengthy, secret preparations, he was present at the founding of the Movimento di Unità Proletaria (MUP) on 10 January 1943. The leading group of the movement was formed by Basso, Luzzatto, Roberto Veratti, and Umberto Recalcati. After 25 July (when Benito Mussolini was ousted by a coup d'état inside his Grand Council of Fascism), the movement joined with the PSI to form the Italian Socialist Party of Proletarian Unity (PSIUP), with Basso as one of the leading figures. Later in 1943, Basso went against the party line to found the clandestine newspaper Bandiera Rossa. In the period leading up to the 1945 Liberation, Basso was an active member of the Italian resistance movement and, with Sandro Pertini and Rodolfo Morandi, he set up the covert executive body of the PSIUP in northern Italy (the territory of the Fascist Italian Social Republic), which he had the responsibility for running. Post-1945, Lelio Basso was elected Vice-secretary of the PSIUP, and, in 1946, became a deputy to the Italian Constituent Assembly which consecrated the Republic. He was on the 75-member Commission that was to write the text of the Italian Constitution, and contributed to the formulation of articles 3 and 49Lelio Basso was contrary to judicial intervention, in the relations between the party and its members: in particular. From 1946 to 1968, he was consistently elected deputy, and was elected senator in 1972 and 1976. ==PSI- PSIUP split== In 1946 he set up the review Quarto Stato, which remained in print until 1950. At the time of the Giuseppe Saragat schism (1947), Basso became Secretary of the PSI, a role he occupied until the Genoa Congress in 1949. In 1950 he was not re-elected to the leading ranks due to his opposing views on the Stalinist leanings of the party at the time. At the 1953 Milan Congress he was not included in the central committee, and was only re- admitted in 1955. At the 1957 Venice Congress, he returned to the ruling body. The following year, Basso launched Problemi del Socialismo (still in print today with the new title Parolechiave). Basso was an active member of the left-wing of the PSI from 1959. In December 1963, he made a voting statement to the Chamber, signed by 24 members of the minority of the Socialist parliamentary group against the first Center-left government (led by Aldo Moro). This earned him suspension from the party, and, in January 1964, he participated in the constituent assembly of the PSIUP. Basso was one of the leaders of the new party, and was its president from 1965 to 1968. ==As lawyer== Lelio Basso founded and wrote for a number of international publications. He was famous throughout Europe as a criminal lawyer, and sat in the Russell Tribunal, an international body presided by Bertrand Russell, established to judge American crimes in the Vietnam War. In 1973, he worked to establish a second Russell Tribunal to examine the repression being carried out in Latin America, and worked to set up the Permanent Peoples' Tribunal (established after his death, in 1979). In 1973 he also founded the Fondazione Lelio e Lisli Basso in Rome, and, in 1976, the Fondazione Internazionale and the Lega Internazionale per i Diritti e la Liberazione dei Popoli. He died in Rome. ==Works== Lelio Basso's life was a medley of intellectual activity and research on the one hand and the search for an effective political instrument on the other, all on an international scale. As an expert and interpreter of the work of Karl Marx, he adopted an original approach in his re-elaboration of the view of Socialism, and drew upon different lines of thought from the sphere of democratic thought in the broadest possible sense (French democratic tradition, German \\"academic socialism\\", Italian socialist thought and the Austro-Marxists). During his internment, he read the works of Rosa Luxemburg, and worked tirelessly to promote a critical awareness of her thought in Italy. Basso wrote a huge number of essays for periodicals and collections. His most important titles include: *Due totalitarismi: fascismo e democrazia cristiana (1951); *Il Partito socialista italiano (1956); *Il principe senza scettro (1958, re-print 1998); *Da Stalin a Krusciov (1962); *Introduction and editorship of R.

In the midlatitudes, the typical value for f is about 10−4 rad/s. Inertial oscillations on the surface of the earth have this frequency. These oscillations are the result of the Coriolis effect. ==Explanation== Consider a body (for example a fixed volume of atmosphere) moving along at a given latitude \\\\varphi at velocity v in the earth's rotating reference frame. In the local reference frame of the body, the vertical direction is parallel to the radial vector pointing from the center of the earth to the location of the body and the horizontal direction is perpendicular to this vertical direction and in the meridional direction. The Coriolis force (proportional to 2 \\\\, \\\\boldsymbol{ \\\\Omega \\\\times v}), however, is perpendicular to the plane containing both the earth's angular velocity vector \\\\boldsymbol{ \\\\Omega} (where \\\\boldsymbol{ \\\\Omega} = \\\\Omega ) and the body's own velocity in the rotating reference frame v. Thus, the Coriolis force is always at an angle \\\\varphi with the local vertical direction. The local horizontal direction of the Coriolis force is thus \\\\Omega \\\\sin \\\\varphi. This force acts to move the body along longitudes or in the meridional directions. ==Equilibrium== Suppose the body is moving with a velocity v such that the centripetal and Coriolis (due to \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\Omega} ) forces on it are balanced. We then have : v^2/r= 2 (\\\\Omega \\\\sin \\\\varphi) v where r is the radius of curvature of the path of object (defined by v). Replacing v = r\\\\omega , where \\\\omega is the magnitude of the spin rate of the Earth, we obtain :f = \\\\omega = 2 \\\\Omega \\\\sin \\\\varphi. Thus the Coriolis parameter, f , is the angular velocity or frequency required to maintain a body at a fixed circle of latitude or zonal region. If the Coriolis parameter is large, the effect of the earth's rotation on the body is significant since it will need a larger angular frequency to stay in equilibrium with the Coriolis forces. Alternatively, if the Coriolis parameter is small, the effect of the earth's rotation is small since only a small fraction of the centripetal force on the body is canceled by the Coriolis force. Thus the magnitude of f strongly affects the relevant dynamics contributing to the body's motion. These considerations are captured in the nondimensionalized Rossby number. ==Rossby number== In stability calculations, the rate of change of f along the meridional direction becomes significant. This is called the Rossby parameter and is usually denoted : \\\\beta = \\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial y} where y is the in the local direction of increasing meridian. This parameter becomes important, for example, in calculations involving Rossby waves. ==See also== *Beta plane *Earth's rotation *Rossby-gravity waves ==References== Category:Atmospheric dynamics Category:Oceanography fr:Force de Coriolis#Paramètre de Coriolis ","title":"Coriolis frequency"},{"id":"3238089","text":"Stavros Konstantinou (Σταύρος Κωνσταντίνου) (born 25 August 1984 in Nicosia, Cyprus) is a Greek Cypriot singer who rose to popularity after winning Super Idol, the Greek version of Pop Idol, shown by MEGA TV in 2004, in its only season under that name.

Industrial warfarep.410, Christon I. Archer, World History of Warfare is a period in the history of warfare ranging roughly from the early 19th century and the start of the Industrial Revolution to the beginning of the Atomic Age, which saw the rise of nation-states, capable of creating and equipping large armies, navies, and air forces, through the process of industrialisation. The era featured mass-conscripted armies, rapid transportation (first on railroads, then by sea and air), telegraph and wireless communications, and the concept of total war. In terms of technology, this era saw the rise of rifled breech-loading infantry weapons capable of high rates of fire, high-velocity breech-loading artillery, chemical weapons, armoured warfare, metal warships, submarines, and aircraft. ==Total war== One of the main features of industrial warfare is the concept of \\"total war\\". The term was coined during World War I by Erich Ludendorff (and again in his 1935 book Total War), which called for the complete mobilization and subordination of all resources, including policy and social systems, to the German war effort. It has also come to mean waging warfare with absolute ruthlessness, and its most identifiable legacy today has been the reintroduction of civilians and civilian infrastructure as targets in destroying the enemy's ability to engage in war. There are several reasons for the rise of total warfare in the 19th century. The main one is industrialization. As countries' capital and natural resources grew, it became clear that some forms of warfare demanded more resources than others. Consequently, the greater cost of warfare became evident. An industrialized nation could distinguish and then choose the intensity of warfare that it wished to engage in. Additionally, warfare was becoming more mechanized and required greater infrastructure. Combatants could no longer live off the land, but required an extensive support network of people behind the lines to keep them fed and armed. This required the mobilization of the home front. Modern concepts like propaganda were first used to boost production and maintain morale, while rationing took place to provide more war materiel. The earliest modern example of total war was the American Civil War. Union generals Ulysses S. Grant and William Tecumseh Sherman were convinced that, if the North was to be victorious, the Confederacy's strategic, economic, and psychological ability to wage war had to be definitively crushed. They believed that to break the backbone of the South, the North had to employ scorched earth tactics, or as Sherman called it, \\"Hard War\\". Sherman's advance through Georgia and the Carolinas was characterized by widespread destruction of civilian supplies and infrastructure.Bailey, Thomas and David Kennedy: The American Pageant, page 434. 1987 In contrast to later conflicts, the damage done by Sherman was almost entirely limited to property destruction. In Georgia alone, Sherman claimed he and his men had caused $100,000,000 in damages. ==Conscription== Soldiers engaged in trench warfare during the American Civil War. Conscription is the compulsory enrollment of civilians into military service. Conscription allowed the French Republic to form La Grande Armée, what Napoleon Bonaparte called \\"the nation in arms\\", which successfully battled smaller, professional European armies. Conscription, particularly when the conscripts are being sent to foreign wars that do not directly affect the security of the nation, has historically been highly politically contentious in democracies. For instance, during World War I, bitter political disputes broke out in Canada (see Conscription Crisis of 1917), Newfoundland, Australia and New Zealand (See Compulsory Military Training) over conscription. Canada also had a political dispute over conscription during World War II (see Conscription Crisis of 1944). Both South Africa and Australia put limits on where conscripts could fight in WWII. Similarly, mass protests against conscription to fight the Vietnam War occurred in several countries in the late 1960s. In developed nations, the increasing emphasis on technological firepower and better-trained fighting forces, the sheer unlikelihood of a conventional military assault on most developed nations, as well as memories of the contentiousness of the Vietnam War experience, make mass conscription unlikely in the foreseeable future. Russia, as well as many smaller nations such as Switzerland, retain mainly conscript armies. ==Transportation== The advent of railroads (such as this one during the American Civil War) allowed armies to cover larger distances in shorter times while suffering minimal fatigue. ===Land=== Prior to the invention of the motorized transport, combatants were transported from by wagons, horses and by marching. With the advent of locomotives, large groups of combatants, supplies, and equipment were able to be transported faster and in larger numbers. To counter this, an opposing force would destroy rail lines to hinder their enemies' movements. General Sherman's men during the American Civil War, would destroy tracks, heat the rails, and wrap them around trees. The mass transportation of combatants was further revolutionized with the advent of the internal combustion engine and the automobile. Combined with the widespread use of the machine gun, the horse, after millennia of use, was finally supplanted in its war time role. During both WWI and WWII, trucks were used to carry combatants and materiel, while cars and jeeps were used to scout enemy positions. The mechanization of infantry occurred during WWII. The tank, a product of World War I invented by the British to break through trenches while withstanding machine gun fire, while discounted by many, came into its own. Tanks evolved from thin-skinned, lumbering vehicles into fast, powerful war machines of various types that dominated the battlefield and allowed the Germans to conquer most of Europe. As a result of the tank's evolution, a number of armored transport vehicles appeared, such as armoured personnel carriers and amphibious vehicles. After the war ended, armored transports continued to evolve. The armored car and train declined in use, largely becoming relegated to military and civilian use as transportation for VIPs. Infantry fighting vehicles rose to prominence with the creation of the Soviet BMP-1. IFVs are a more combat capable version of the APC, with heavier armaments (such as autocannons), while still retaining the ability to transport combatants into and out of battles. ===Sea=== Sealift is a military logistics term referring to the use of cargo ships for the deployment of military assets, such as weaponry, military personnel, and materiel supplies. It complements other means of transport, such as strategic airlifters, in order to enhance a state's ability to project power. A state's sealift capabilities may include civilian-operated ships that normally operate by contract, but which can be chartered or commandeered during times of military necessity to supplement government-owned naval fleets. During WWI, the United States bought, borrowed or commandeered vessels of various types, ranging from pleasure craft to ocean liners to transport the American Expeditionary Force to Europe. Many of these ships were scrapped, sold or returned to their owners after the war. ===Air=== There are two different kinds of airlifts in warfare, a strategic airlift and a tactical airlift. A strategic airlift is the use transporting of weapons, supplies and personnel over long distances (from a base in one country to a base in another country for example) using large cargo aircraft. This contrasts with tactical airlifts, which involves transporting the same above items within a theater of operations. This usually involves cargo planes with shorter ranges and slower speeds, but higher maneuverability. ==Communications== *Cryptography *Homing pigeon/War pigeon *Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet *Message precedence *Semaphore (communication) *Signal Corps *Smoke signal *Telegraphy ===Equipment=== *Aldis lamp *International maritime signal flags ==Land warfare== An American M4 Sherman in action during the Korean War. Land warfare, as the name implies, takes place on land. The most common type of warfare, it can encompass several modes and locales, including urban, arctic, and mountain warfare. The early part of the 19th century from 1815 to 1848 saw a long period of peace in Europe, accompanied by extraordinary industrial expansion. The industrial age brought about various technological advancements, each with their own implication. Land warfare moved from visual-range and semi person-to-person combat of the previous era, to indiscriminate and impersonal, \\"beyond visual range\\" warfare. The Crimean War (1853–1856) saw the introduction of trench warfare, long-range artillery, railroads, the telegraph, and the rifle. The mechanized mass-destruction of enemy combatants grew ever more deadly. In WWI (1914–1918) machine-guns, barbed wire, chemical weapons, and land-mines entered the battlefield. The deadly stalemated trench-warfare stage was finally passed with the advent of the modern armored tank late in WWI. One major trend involved the transition away massed infantry fire and human waves to more refined tactics. This became possible with the superseding of earlier weapons like the highly inaccurate musket. ===Technological advances=== A British artillery piece in action during the Battle of Gallipoli, 1915. Rifling refers to the act of adding spiral grooves to the inside the barrel of a firearm. The grooves would cause a projectile to spin as it traveled down the barrel, improving range and accuracy. Once rifling became easier and practical, a new type of firearm was introduced, the rifle. It gave combatants the ability to specifically target an enemy combatant, rather than have large numbers of combatants fire in a general direction. It effectively broke up groups of combatants into smaller more maneuverable units. Artillery are large guns designed to fire large projectiles a great distance. Early artillery pieces were large and cumbersome with slow rates of fire. This reduced their use to sieges, by both defenders and attackers. With the advent of the industrial age and various technological advancements, lighter, yet powerful and accurate artillery pieces were produced. This gave rise to field artillery which were used on a tactical level to support troops. Machine guns are fully automatic guns. In this era of warfare they only existed as mounted support weapons, as automatic firearms were not yet developed. Early machine guns as invented by Richard Gatling, were hand cranked but evolved into truly automatic machine guns by Maxim at the end of the era. Machine guns were valued for their ability to smash infantry formations, especially attacking enemy formations when they were dense. This, along with effective field artillery, changed tactics drastically. ===Static defense=== Static defenses evolved from the use of permanent fortifications that were direct descendants of medieval castles. As artillery improved in destructive power and penetrative ability, more modern fortifications were developed, using first thicker layers of stone, then concrete and steel. After naval artillery developed the turret – a moving cannon platform – land fortifications started to use this method as well. Between the World Wars, France built an \\"impregnable\\" underground steel and concrete fortification that ran the length of the German-French border. This Maginot Line failed to stop German tanks in 1940: they bypassed the fortifications by invading through neighboring Belgium. Temporary fortifications. As artillery and rifles allowed the killing of enemy personnel at a longer effective range, soldiers started to dig into temporary fortifications. These included massive trenches as used in WWI, and individual soldier-sized \\"fox holes\\" which became more common in WWII. ===Maneuver warfare=== Starting in 1965, commanders could insert large forces behind enemy lines, first by plane and later by helicopter. Maneuver had existed throughout military history – from soldiers marching on the field to using horses in cavalry formations. It was not until the advent of mechanized transport over unprepared terrain, such as fields and deserts, using tanks and armored vehicles, that \\"maneuver warfare\\" became feasible. First used by the German army in Poland and France in WWII, Blitzkrieg or \\"lightning war\\" saw whole armies moved rapidly on tracked and armored fighting vehicles. During the war airborne movement was used, with soldiers dropped to the battlefield by parachute by both the Germans and the Allies. After WWII, developments in helicopters brought a more practical way to transport troops by air. * Armoured warfare * Blitzkrieg * Deep operations ==Naval warfare== Cumberland by the Confederate ironclad Virginia in 1862 marked the beginning of the end for wooden warships. ===Ironclads and Dreadnoughts=== The period after the Napoleonic Wars was one of intensive experimentation with new technology; steam power for ships appeared in the 1810s, improved metallurgy and machining technique produced larger and deadlier guns, and the development of explosive shells, capable of demolishing a wooden ship at a single blow, in turn required the addition of iron armor, which led to ironclads. The famous battle of the CSS Virginia and USS Monitor in the American Civil War was the duel of ironclads that symbolized the changing times. Although the battle was inconclusive, nations around the world subsequently raced to convert their fleets to iron, as ironclads had shown themselves to be clearly superior to wooden ships in their ability to withstand enemy fire. In the late 19th century, naval warfare was revolutionized by Alfred Thayer Mahan's book The Influence of Sea Power upon History. Mahan argued that in the Anglo-French wars of the 18th and 19th centuries, domination of the sea was the deciding factor in the outcome, and therefore control of seaborne commerce was critical to military victory. Mahan argued that the best way to achieve naval domination was through large fleets of concentrated capital ships, as opposed to commerce raiders. His books were closely studied in all the Great Powers, influencing their naval arms race in the years prior to WWI. In 1906 the British warship became the first warship to have both a uniform main battery and steam turbine engines, creating a standard for warships that lasted until the 1940s. As the century came to a close, the familiar modern battleship began to emerge; a steel-armored ship, entirely dependent on steam turbines, and sporting a number of large shell guns mounted in turrets arranged along the centerline of the main deck. The ultimate design was reached in 1906 with , which entirely dispensed with smaller guns, her main guns being sufficient to sink any existing ship of the time. The Russo-Japanese War and particularly the Battle of Tsushima in 1905 was the first test of the new concepts, resulting in a stunning Japanese victory and the destruction of dozens of Russian ships. World War I pitted the old Royal Navy against the new navy of Imperial Germany, culminating in the 1916 Battle of Jutland. Following the war, many nations agreed to limit the size of their fleets in the Washington Naval Treaty and scrapped many of their battleships and cruisers. Growing tensions of the 1930s restarted the building programs, with even larger ships than before: the Japanese battleship Yamato, launched in 1941, displaced 72,000 tons and mounted guns. This marked the climax of \\"big gun\\" warfare, as aircraft would gradually play a larger role in warfare. By the 1960s, battleships had all-but vanished from the fleets of the world. ===Aircraft carriers=== In the 1940s aircraft carriers supplanted battleships as the centerpiece of the fleet. Here, American torpedo bombers prepare to take off during the Battle of Midway in 1942. Between the world wars, the first aircraft carriers appeared, initially as a way to circumvent the tonnage limits of the Washington Naval Treaty (many of the first carriers were converted battlecruisers). Though several ships had previously been designed to launch and in some cases, the first true \\"flat-top\\" carrier was , launched in December 1917. By the start of WWII, aircraft carriers typically carried three types of aircraft: torpedo bombers, which could also be used for conventional horizontal bombing and reconnaissance; dive bombers, also used for reconnaissance; and fighters for fleet defence and bomber escort duties. Because of the restricted space on aircraft carriers, these aircraft were almost always small, single-engined warplanes. The first true demonstration of naval air power was the victory of the Royal Navy at the Battle of Taranto in 1940, which set the stage for Japan's much larger and more famous attack on Pearl Harbor the following year. Two days after Pearl Harbor, the sinking of HMS Prince of Wales and HMS Repulse, marked the beginning of the end for the battleship era. Following WWII, aircraft carriers continued to remain key to navies throughout the latter 20th century, moving in the 1950s to jets launched from Supercarriers, behemoths which could displace as much as 100,000 tons. ===Submarines=== Some 80 Japanese Type D (\\"Koryu\\") midget submarines in a dry dock at Kure, October 19, 1945 Just as important was the development of submarines to travel underneath the sea, at first for short dives, then later to be able to spend weeks or months underwater powered by a nuclear reactor. The first successful submarine attack in wartime was in 1864 by the Confederate submarine H.L. Hunley which sank the frigate . In both World Wars, submarines primarily exerted their power by sinking merchant ships using torpedoes, in addition to attacks on warships. All nations practiced unrestricted submarine warfare in which submarines sank merchant ships without warning, but the only successful campaign during this period was America's submarine war against Japan during the Pacific War. In the 1950s the Cold War inspired the development of ballistic missile submarines, each one loaded with dozens of nuclear-armed missiles and with orders to launch them from sea should the other nation attack. ==Aerial warfare== Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bombers flying in a large attack formation The first use of airplanes in war was the Italo-Turkish War of 1911, when the Italians carried out several reconnaissance and bombing missions. During WWI both sides made use of balloons and airplanes for reconnaissance and directing artillery fire. To prevent enemy reconnaissance, some airplane pilots began attacking other airplanes and balloons, first with small arms carried in the cockpit, and later with machine guns mounted on the aircraft. Both sides also made use of aircraft for bombing, strafing and dropping of propaganda leaflets. The German air force carried out the first terror bombing raids, using Zeppelins to drop bombs on Britain. By the end of the war airplanes had become specialised into bombers, fighters, and surveillance aircraft. Most of these airplanes were biplanes with wooden frames, canvas skins, wire rigging and air-cooled engines. Between 1918 and 1939, aircraft technology developed very rapidly. By 1939 military biplanes were in the process of being replaced with metal framed monoplanes, often with stressed skins and liquid cooled engines. Top speeds had tripled; altitudes doubled (and oxygen masks become commonplace); ranges and payloads of bombers increased enormously. Some theorists, most famously Hugh Trenchard and Giulio Douhet, believed that aircraft would become the dominant military arm in the future, and argued that future wars would be won entirely by the destruction of the enemy's military and industrial capability from the air. This concept was called strategic bombing. Douhet also argued in The Command of the Air (1921) that future military leaders could avoid falling into bloody World War I-style trench stalemates by using aviation to strike past the enemy's forces directly at their vulnerable civilian population, which Douhet believed would cause these populations to rise up in revolt to stop the bombing. Others, such as Billy Mitchell, saw the potential of air power to neutralize the striking power of naval surface fleets. Mitchell himself proved the vulnerability of capital ships to aircraft was finally in 1921 when he commanded a squadron of bombers that sank the ex-German battleship SMS Ostfriesland with aerial bombs. (See Industrial warfare#Naval warfare) During WWII, there was a debate between strategic bombing and tactical bombing. Strategic bombing focused on targets such as factories, railroads, oil refineries, and heavily populated areas such as cities and towns, and required heavy four-engine bombers carrying large payloads of ordnance or a single heavy four-engine bomber carrying a nuclear weapon flying deep into enemy territory. Tactical bombing focused on concentration of combatants, command and control centers, airfields, and ammunition dumps, and required attack aircraft, dive bombers, and fighter bombers that could fly low over the battlefield. In the early years of WWII, the German Luftwaffe focused on tactical bombing, using large numbers of Ju 87 Stukas as \\"flying artillery\\" for land offensives. Artillery was slow and required time to set up a firing position, whereas aircraft were better able keep up with the fast advances of the German panzer columns. Close air support greatly assisted in the successes of the German Army in the Battle of France. It was also important in amphibious warfare, where aircraft carriers could provide support for soldiers landing on the beaches. Boeing B-29 Superfortress bombers under construction on an assembly line Strategic bombing, by contrast, was unlike anything the world has seen before or since. In 1940, the Germans attempted to force Britain to surrender through attacks on its airfields and factories, and then on its cities in The Blitz in what became the Battle of Britain, the first major battle whose outcome was determined primarily in the air. The campaigns conducted in Europe and Asia could involve thousands of aircraft dropping tens of thousands of tons of munitions over a single city. Military aviation in the post-war years was dominated by the needs of the Cold War. The postwar years saw a rapid conversion to jet power, which resulted in enormous increases in speeds and altitudes of aircraft. Until the advent of the intercontinental ballistic missile, major powers relied on high-altitude bombers to deliver their newly developed nuclear deterrent. Each country strove to develop the technology of bombers and the high-altitude fighters that could intercept them. The concept of air superiority began to play a heavy role in aircraft designs for both the United States and the Soviet Union. ==End of industrial warfare== With the invention of nuclear weapons, the concept of full-scale war carries the prospect of global annihilation, and as such conflicts since WWII have by definition been \\"low intensity\\" conflicts, typically in the form of proxy wars fought within local regional confines, using what are now referred to as \\"conventional weapons\\", typically combined with the use of asymmetric warfare tactics and applied use of intelligence. ===Nuclear warfare=== US test launch of a German V-2 ballistic missile. The use of nuclear weapons first came into being during the last months of WWII, with the dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. This was the only use of nuclear weapons in combat. For a decade after World War II, the United States and later the Soviet Union (and to a lesser extent the United Kingdom and France) developed and maintained a strategic force of bombers that would be able to attack any potential aggressor from bases inside their countries. Before the development of a capable strategic missile force in the Soviet Union, much of the war- fighting doctrine held by western nations revolved around the use of a large number of smaller nuclear weapons used in a tactical role. It is arguable if such use could be considered \\"limited\\" however, because it was believed that the US would use their own strategic weapons (mainly bombers at the time) should the USSR deploy any kind of nuclear weapon against civilian targets. A revolution in thinking occurred with the introduction of the intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), which the Soviet Union first successfully tested in the late 1950s. To deliver a warhead to a target, a missile was far less expensive than a bomber that could do the same job. Moreover, at the time it was impossible to intercept ICBMs due to their high altitude and speed. In the 1960s, another major shift in nuclear doctrine occurred with the development of the submarine-based nuclear missile (SLBM). It was hailed by military theorists as a weapon that would assure a surprise attack would not destroy the capability to retaliate, and therefore would make nuclear war less likely. ===The Cold War=== Since the end of WWII, no industrial nations have fought such a large, decisive war, due to the availability of weapons that are so destructive that their use would offset the advantages of victory. The fighting of a total war where nuclear weapons are used is something that instead of taking years and the full mobilisation of a country's resources such as in WWII, would take tens of minutes. Such weapons are developed and maintained with relatively modest peace time defence budgets. By the end of the 1950s, the ideological stand-off of the Cold War between the Western World and the Soviet Union involved thousands of nuclear weapons being aimed at each side by the other. Strategically, the equal balance of destructive power possessed by each side situation came to be known as Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD), the idea that a nuclear attack by one superpower would result in nuclear counter-strike by the other. This would result in hundreds of millions of deaths in a world where, in words widely attributed to Nikita Khrushchev, \\"The living will envy the dead\\".Attributed to Nikita Khrushchev, speaking of nuclear war www.bartleby.com During the Cold War, the superpowers sought to avoid open conflict between their respective forces, as both sides recognized that such a clash could very easily escalate, and quickly involve nuclear weapons. Instead, the superpowers fought each other through their involvement in proxy wars, military buildups, and diplomatic standoffs. In the case of proxy wars, each superpower supported its respective allies in conflicts with forces aligned with the other superpower, such as in the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. ==Milestones== { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" - bgcolor=\\"#efefef\\" !

Juvenile laggars are brown birds overall, very similar to juvenile saker falcons Falco cherrug. Markings on underparts vary from dark chocolaty brown to sparse brown blotches. The laggar falcon (Falco jugger), also known as the lugger falcon or jugger (from Hindi जग्गर — jaggar, “falcon”) is a mid-sized bird of prey which occurs in the Indian subcontinent from extreme southeastern Iran, southeastern Afghanistan, Pakistan, through India, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh and northwestern Myanmar. It resembles the lanner falcon but is darker overall, and has blackish \\"trousers\\" (tibiotarsus feathers). Fledglings have an almost entirely dark underside, and first-year subadult birds still retain much dark on the belly. This species belongs to a close-knit complex of falcons known as hierofalcons. In this group, there is ample evidence for rampant hybridization and incomplete lineage sorting which confounds analyses of DNA sequence data to a massive extent; molecular studies with small sample sizes can simply not be expected to yield reliable conclusions in the entire hierofalcon group. The radiation of the entire living diversity of hierofalcons seems to have taken place in the Eemian interglacial at the start of the Late Pleistocene, a mere 130,000-115,000 years ago; the laggar falcon represents a lineage that arrived at its present range out of eastern Africa by way of the Arabian Peninsula which during that time had a more humid climate than today.Helbig et al.

It tells the story of the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 which left 700,000 people homeless in Louisiana and Mississippi. ==Lyrics== Sung from the perspective of a nameless resident of the area recounting the flooding of St. Bernard and Plaquemines parishes during the flood, \\"Louisiana 1927\\" features lyrics that depict the devastation of the residents of those parishes in the aftermath of the flood. In particular, the narrator lays out the widespread nature of the destruction (\\"river had busted through clear down to Plaquemines\\") and the volume of water the flood produced (\\"six feet of water in the streets of Evangeline\\"). Also touched upon is the callous response of the federal government, depicted here via a fictional visit from President Calvin Coolidge and \\"a little fat man,\\" where Coolidge's reaction to the devastation is a detached statement that, \\"isn't it a shame what the river has done to this poor cracker's land.\\" In 2005, after Hurricane Katrina, NPR interviewed Newman about the song. He said \\"I was born in Los Angeles, but I went to New Orleans when I was, like, a week old. My mother is from there, her family is still there. I lived with her a few years when I was a baby, and I'd go back in the summers.

The Aurora is the younger sister ship to the M/V LeConte and both serve or have served as feeder vessels that pick up passengers in small communities such as Pelican and Hoonah and take them to larger regional communities (this process is colloquially known as the \\"milk run\\"). However, unlike the LeConte, the Aurora was moved out of Southeast Alaska into Prince William Sound area in 2005 to take the place of the retired M/V Bartlett. This move, however, was highly controversial as the M/V Chenega, a fast ferry, was supposed to take this role and been promised for years in advance to the Prince William Sound area and specifically to be homeported in the city of Cordova. Instead, the ferry system reneged on this promise and moved the Chenega to a Ketchikan-Wrangell route. Currently, the Aurora is being hubbed out of Cordova (although, unlike the fast ferry, the Aurora operates 24-hours a day so it doesn't have a crew that lives in its homeport thus denying that city the economic stimulus of additional residents/jobs. This is the primary motive for the especially rancorous uproar from Cordova regarding the Chenegas route placement) and operating principally between Cordova, Whittier, and Valdez with whistle stops (the ferry only stops if there are prior reservations) in Tatitlek and Chenega Bay. The Auroras amenities include a hot-food cafeteria, movie and forward observation lounges, and solarium. There are no cabins on the Aurora both because of its small size and the lack of demand due to its feeder route running times. The Aurora and the M/V LeConte are the only AMHS vessels able to serve the communities of Angoon, Kake, Pelican, Tenakee Springs and Hoonah. This quality is due because of these vessels' small sizes thus making them both vital assets for the ferry system and the residents of these rural villages although currently the Aurora is not being utilized for this unique capacity. ==External links== * Official Alaska Marine Highway System website Alaska Marine Highway System vessels Category:1977 ships Category:Ships built by Peterson Builders ","title":"MV Aurora (1977)"},{"id":"3238184","text":"Asha Parekh (born 2 October 1942) is an Indian film actress, director, and producer who appeared in many commercially successful films throughout her career. She was the highest paid actress of her time and was one of the most successful actresses of the 1960s and 1970s. She is considered one of the most influential actresses of all time in Hindi cinema. In 1992, she was honoured with the Padma Shri by the Government of India for her contribution to the field of cinema. == Early life == Asha Parekh is a Gujarati born on 2 October 1942. Her mother, Sudha aka Salma Parekh, was a Bohra Muslim and her father, Bachubhai Parekh, was Hindu Gujarati. Her mother enrolled her in Indian classical dance classes at an early age and she learned from many teachers, including Pandit Bansilal Bharati. == Career == Parekh started her career as a child artist under the screen name Baby Asha Parekh. Famed film director Bimal Roy saw her dance at a stage function and cast her at the age of ten in Maa (1952) and then repeated her in Baap Beti (1954).Parekh, Asha and Mohammed, Khalid. The Hit Girl. New Delhi: Om Books International (2017), p. 49 The latter film's failure disappointed her, and even though she did a few more child roles, she quit to resume her schooling. At sixteen she decided to try acting again, and to make her debut as a heroine, but she was rejected from Vijay Bhatt's Goonj Uthi Shehnai (1959) in favour of actress Ameeta, because the filmmaker claimed she was not star material. Precisely eight days later, film producer Subodh Mukherjee and writer-director Nasir Hussain cast her as the heroine in Dil Deke Dekho (1959), opposite Shammi Kapoor, which made her a huge star. It also started a long association with Hussain who cast her as his heroine in six more films: Jab Pyar Kisi Se Hota Hai (1961), Phir Wohi Dil Laya Hoon (1963), Teesri Manzil (1966), Baharon Ke Sapne (1967), Pyar Ka Mausam (1969), and Caravan (1971). She also did a cameo in Nasir Hussain's film Manzil Manzil (1984) with whom she had earlier done 6 films. Hussain also got her involved in distribution of 21 films, starting with Baharon Ke Sapne (1967). Parekh was primarily known as a glamour girl/excellent dancer/tomboy in most of her films, until director Raj Khosla gave her a serious image by casting her in tragedienne roles in three of her favourite films; Do Badan (1966), Chirag (1969) and Main Tulsi Tere Aangan Ki (1978). Director Shakti Samanta gave her more dramatic roles in her other favourite films, Pagla Kahin Ka (1970) and Kati Patang (1970); the latter earned her the Filmfare Award for Best Actress. Many important directors repeatedly cast her in several of their films, including Vijay Anand and Mohan Segal. Parekh acted in her mother tongue by starring in three Gujarati films at the height of her fame in Hindi films, the first being Akhand Saubhagyavati (1963), which became a huge hit. She also acted in some Punjabi films, such as Kankan De Ohle (1971) opposite Dharmendra and Lambhardarni (1976) with Dara Singh, as well as the hit Kannada film Sharavegada Saradara (1989). After her days as a leading lady ended, Parekh took on supporting roles as bhabhi (sister-in-law) and mother, but she called this the \\"awkward phase\\" of her career. So she stopped acting in films, and her friends recommended that she become a television director. She took their advice and became a television director in the early 1990s with the Gujarati serial Jyoti. She formed a production company, Akruti, and produced serials like Palash ke Phool, Baaje Payal, Kora Kagaz and a comedy, Dal Mein Kaala. She was the president of the Cine Artistes' Association from 1994 to 2000. Parekh was the first female chairperson of the Central Board of Film Certification (Censor Board) of India. She held the post from 1998 to 2001 for which she received no salary, but plenty of controversy for censoring films and for not giving clearance to Shekhar Kapur's Elizabeth. Later, she became the treasurer of the Cine and Television Artists Association (CINTAA) and was later elected as one of its office-bearers. Asha stopped acting in 1995 to pursue directing and producing television serials. Parekh received the Filmfare Lifetime Achievement Award in 2002. She has continued to receive other Lifetime Achievement Awards: the Kalakar Award in 2004; the International Indian Film Academy Awards in 2006; the Pune International Film Festival Award in 2007; and the Ninth Annual Bollywood Award in Long Island, New York in 2007. She received the Living Legend Award from the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI). In 2008, she was a judge on the reality show Tyohaar Dhamaaka on the Indian entertainment channel 9X. In 2017, her autobiography (co-written by Khalid Mohammed) titled \\"The Hit Girl\\" was released. == Personal life == Asha parekh celebrating her 70th Birthday with Sushmita Sen and Aruna Irani Parekh has remained unmarried, claiming that her reputation of being unapproachable made people hesitate in asking for her hand in marriage. In her memoir \\"The Hit Girl\\", she confirmed rumourshttps://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/fareeha7/intthr3.html&date;=2009-10-25+22:03:38 Sadhana (actress) referred to a relationship between Asha and Nasir Hussain, but also acknowledged that she did not know the extent of their relationship] that she was romantically involved with director Nasir Hussain who was already married, but out of respect for both their families, she couldn't marry him.Parekh, Asha and Mohammed, Khalid. The Hit Girl. New Delhi: Om Books International (2017), p. 214-217 Previously, Parekh would only state that she had a longtime boyfriend but declined to elaborate on the relationship, only stating that \\"it was nice while it lasted.\\" She said she had not seen Nasir Hussain during the last year of his life, as he became reclusive because of his wife's death, but she did speak to him the day before he died in 2002. She almost married an Indian professor living in America, but he didn't want to give up his girlfriend, so she called off their wedding plans. She had also tried to adopt a child, but he had birth defects, and the doctors refused to let her adopt him. Today, Parekh concentrates on her dance academy Kara Bhavan and the Asha Parekh Hospital in Santa Cruz, Mumbai, named in her honour because of her many humanitarian contributions. == Filmography == * Maa (1952) as Child artist * Aasmaan (1952) as (as Baby Asha Parekh) * Dhobi Doctor (1954) as Child artist * Baap Beti (1954) as Child artist * Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu (1954) as Child artist * Ayodhyapati (1956) * Ustad (1957) as Child artist * Aasha (1957) (as Asha) * Dil Deke Dekho (1959) as Neeta Narayan * Hum Hindustani (1960) as Sudha * Ghunghat (1960) as Laxmi * Jab Pyar Kisise Hota Hai (1961) as Nisha R.

Oscilla, a word applied in Latin usage to small figures, most commonly masks or faces, which were hung up as offerings to various deities, either for propitiation or expiation, and in connection with festivals and other ceremonies. It is usually taken as the plural of oscillum (diminutive of os), a little face. As the oscilla swung in the wind, oscillare came to mean to swing, hence in English oscillation, the act of swinging backwards and forwards, periodic motion to and fro, hence any variation or fluctuation, actual or figurative. Many oscilla or masks, representing the head of Bacchus or of different rustic deities, are still preserved. There is a marble oscillum of Bacchus in the British Museum. Others still in existence are made of earthenware, but it seems probable that wax and wood were the ordinary materials. Small rudely shaped figures of wool, known as pilae, were also hung up in the same way as the oscilla. The festivals at which the hanging of oscilla took place were: * The Sementivae Feriae, or sowing festivals, and the Paganalia, the country festivals of the tutelary deities of the pagi; both took place in January. Here the oscilla were hung on trees, such as the vine and the olive, oak and the pine, and represented the faces of Liber, Bacchus or other deity connected with the cultivation of the soil (Virgil, Georgics ii.382-396). * The Feriae Latinae; in this case games were played, among them swinging (oscil(atio); cf. the Greek festival of Aeora (see Erigone). Festus (s.v. Oscillum, ed. Muller, p. 194) says that this swinging was called oscillatio because the swingers masked their faces (os celare) out of shame. * At the Compitalia, Festus says (Paulus ex Fest., ed. Muller, p. 239) that pilae and effigies viriles et muliebres made of wool were hung at the crossroads to the Lares, the number of pilae equalling that of the slaves of the family, the effigies that of the children; the purpose being to induce the Lares to spare the living, and to be content with the pilae and images. This has led to the generally accepted conclusion that the custom of hanging these oscilla represents an older practice of expiating human sacrifice. There is also no doubt a connection with the Lustratio in that both rely on purification by the air. == References == Category:Roman mythology ","title":"Oscilla"},{"id":"3238212","text":"De Striene was a water channel that ran between the Schelde near Tholen and the Maas rivers in Zeeland in the Netherlands. In the St. Elizabeth's Flood of 1421 the watercourses in the Maas and Rhine delta were drastically changed, and the Striene disappeared.

Little. New York: Facts on File, c1991. Though many are in urban areas, there are some rural greenways, as for example the Monadnock-Sunapee Greenway, a hiking trail in southern New Hampshire. Greenways are frequently created out of disused railways, canal towpaths, utility or similar rights of way, or derelict industrial land. Rail trails are one of the most common forms of greenway. Greenways also resemble linear parks, and can serve as wildlife corridors. In Southern England, the term also refers to ancient trackways or green lanes, especially those found on chalk downlands, like the Ridgeway.The Ridgeway Project == Terminology == Charles River Esplanade, Boston, Massachusetts, US The American author Charles Little in his 1990 book, Greenways for America,Susquehanna Greenway defines a greenway as: A linear open space established along either a natural corridor, such as a riverfront, stream valley or ridgeline, or overland along a railroad right-of-way converted to recreational use, a canal, scenic road or other route. It is a natural or landscaped course for pedestrian or bicycle passage; an open-space connector linking parks, nature reserves, cultural features, or historic sites with each other and with populated areas; locally certain strip or linear parks designated as parkway or greenbelt.Tennessee Greenways and Trails: \\"What is a greenway\\". The term greenway comes from the green in green belt and the way in parkway, implying a recreational or pedestrian use rather than a typical street corridor, as well as an emphasis on introducing or maintaining vegetation, in a location where such vegetation is otherwise lacking. Some greenways include community gardens as well as typical park-style landscaping of trees and shrubs. They also tend to have a mostly contiguous pathway. Greenways resemble linear parks, but the latter are only found in urban and suburban environments. Though wildlife corridors are also greenways, because they have conservation as their primary purpose, they are not necessarily managed as parks for recreational use, and may not include facilities such as public trails. Tom Turner analyzed greenways in London looking for common patterns among successful examples. He was inspired by the pattern language technique of architect Christopher Alexander. Turner concluded there are seven types, or 'patterns', of greenway which he named: parkway, blueway, paveway, glazeway, skyway, ecoway and cycleway.Turner (1995) The European Greenways Association defines it as \\"communication routes reserved exclusively for non- motorized journeys, developed in an integrated manner which enhances both the environment and quality of life of the surrounding area. These routes should meet satisfactory standards of width, gradient and surface condition to ensure that they are both user-friendly and low-risk for users of all abilities.\\" (Lille Declaration, European Greenways Association, 12 September 2000). == Characteristics == Railway Platforms on Parkland Walk, North London, England Charles Little describes five general types of greenways:Tennessee Greenways and Trails * Urban riverside (or other water body) greenways, usually created as part of (or instead of) a redevelopment program along neglected, often run- down, city waterfronts. * Recreational greenways, featuring paths and trails of various kinds, often relatively long distance, based on natural corridors as well as canals, abandoned rail beds, and public rights-of-way. * Ecologically significant natural corridors, usually along rivers and streams and less often ridgelines, to provide for wildlife migration and species interchange, nature study and hiking. * Scenic and Historic routes, usually along a road, highway or waterway, the most representative of them making an effort to provide pedestrian access along the route or at least places to alight from the car. * Comprehensive greenway systems or networks, usually based on natural landforms such as valleys or ridges but sometimes simply an opportunistic assemblage of greenways and open spaces of various kinds to create an alternative municipal or regional green infrastructure. Greenways are vegetated, linear, and multi-purpose. They incorporate a footpath or bikeway within a linear park. In urban design, they are a component of planning for bicycle commuting and walkability. Greenways are found in rural areas as well as urban. Corridors redeveloped as greenways often travel through both city and country, connecting them together. Even in rural areas, greenways provide residents access to open land managed as parks, as contrasted with land that is vegetated but inappropriate for public use, such as agricultural land. Where the historic rural road network has been enlarged and redesigned to favor high-speed automobile travel, greenways provide an alternative for people who are elderly, young, less mobile or seeking a reflective pace.Natural EnglandLoh et al. Greenways are found all over the world. However, most examples are known to be in Europe and North America. ==Foreshoreway== Chicago Lakefront Trail In Australia, a foreshoreway is a greenway that provides a public right-of-way along the edge of the sea, open to both walkers and cyclists.Foreshoreways of Australia's Gold Coast Foreshoreways include oceanways,Foreshoreways of Australia's Gold Coast and resemble promenades and boardwalks. Foreshoreways are usually concerned with the idea of sustainable transport and the term is used to avoid the suggestion that the route favours either pedestrians (footpath) or cyclists (bikeway). A foreshoreway is accessible to both pedestrians and cyclists and gives them the opportunity to move unimpeded along the seashore. Dead end paths that offer public access only to the ocean are not part of a foreshoreway. A foreshoreway corridor often includes a number of traffic routes that provide access along an oceanfront,Foreshoreways of Australia's Gold Coast including: * walking along the beach * edge of foreshore off-road greenway * edge of road off-road greenway * on road bikeway * on road private vehicles routes * on road public transport corridor A major example is The Gold Coast Oceanway along beaches in Gold Coast, Queensland, a shared use pedestrian and cyclist pathway on the Gold Coast, connecting the Point Danger lighthouse on the New South Wales and Queensland border to the Gold Coast Seaway. The network includes of poor, medium and high quality pathways. Others include: The Chicago Lakefront Trail, the Dubai Marina, the East River Greenway, New Plymouth Coastal Walkway, and the Manhattan Waterfront Greenway. Public rights of way frequently exist on the foreshore of beaches throughout the world. In legal discussions the foreshore is often referred to as the wet-sand area (see Right of way for a fuller discussion). == Notable examples == ===Asia=== *Guangdong Greenway, Guangdong province, China including much of Guangzhou city including the Guangzhou Higher Education Mega Center in Panyu District provides foot and bicycle paths along the Pearl River and other scenic areas.American Trails: Pearl River Greenway, China ===Australia=== *Gold Coast Oceanway *Cooks River to Iron Cove Greenway ===Canada=== *Vancouver Greenway Network, a list of Vancouver City Greenways *Carrall Street Greenway, currently under development in Vancouver *Central Valley Greenway, a 24-kilometre pedestrian and cyclist route through Metro Vancouver, running from Vancouver to New Westminster. *Chrysler Canada Greenway is a 42 km-long rail trail in Essex County, Ontario *Trans Canada Trail; Newfoundland T'Railway, Newfoundland *Welland Canal Parkway Trail, St Catharines and Port Colborne, Ontario ===Europe=== *EuroVelo cycle routes and the European Greenways Association routes throughout Europe. *Vía Verde del Pas, between El Astillero and Puente Viesgo in Spain *RAVeL network is an autonomous network of slow ways in Belgium.

Saroja Devi (born 7 January 1938), is an Indian actress who has acted in Tamil, Kannada, Telugu and Hindi movies. She acted in around 200 films in over six decades. She is known by the epithets \\"Abhinaya Saraswathi\\" (Saraswathi of acting) in Kannada and \\"Kannadathu Paingili\\" (Kannada's Parrot) in Tamil. At the age of 17, Saroja Devi got her big break with her movie, the Kannada film Mahakavi Kalidasa (1955). In Telugu cinema, she made her debut with Panduranga Mahatyam (1959), and starred in a number of successful films until the late 1970s. The Tamil film Nadodi Mannan (1958) made her one of the top actresses in Tamil cinema. After her marriage in 1967, she continued to be the second in demand actress in Tamil films till 1974, but she continued to be one of the top actresses in Telugu and Kannada cinema from 1958 until the 1980s. She also starred in Hindi films until the mid-1960s, starting with Paigham (1959). She played the lead heroine in 161 consecutive films in 29 years between 1955 and 1984. Saroja Devi received the Padma Sri, the fourth-highest civilian honour, in 1969 and Padma Bhushan, third highest civilian award, in 1992 from the Government of India, honorary doctorate from Bangalore University and Kalaimamani award from Tamil Nadu. == Early life == Saroja Devi was born in Bangalore, Kingdom of Mysore (now Bengaluru, Karnataka) on 7 January 1938. Her father Bhairappa worked for the police department, and her mother Rudramma was a homemaker. She was their fourth daughter. Her grandfather, Mayanna Gowda wanted her to be given away for adoption, but her father refused to do so. Bhairappa asked her to learn dancing, and encouraged her to take up acting as a career. A young Saroja Devi was accompanied often by her father to studios and he would patiently tie on her salangais and massage her swollen feet after her dancing stints. Her mother gave her a strict dress code: no swimsuits and no sleeveless blouses, which she followed for the rest of her career. She was first spotted by B.R. Krishnamurthy when she was singing at a function at the age of 13, but she declined the film offer. == Career == === Rise to stardom === Saroja Devi's debut movie and also her first major success was Honnappa Bhagavatar's Kannada film Mahakavi Kalidasa (1955), in which she played a supporting role. The film won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Kannada. Next, she acted in B. R. Panthulu's Tamil film Thangamalai Ragasiyam (1957), in which she performed a dance sequence. Subsequently, she was noted by M. G. Ramachandran (MGR), who cast her as the female lead in Nadodi Mannan (1958), the movie that made her one of the most popular actresses in Tamil Nadu. She was then signed up for the Hindi film Paigham (1959), in which her co-stars included Dilip Kumar. She went on to work in other leading Hindi actors, including Rajendra Kumar in Sasural (1961), Sunil Dutt in Beti Bete (1964) and Shammi Kapoor in Pyaar Kiya To Darna Kya (1963). She also shot a few scenes with Raj Kapoor for Nazrana (1961), but was replaced by Vyjayanthimala after a conflict with the director C. V. Sridhar. Following the success of Nadodi Mannan, she was also cast opposite the leading Tamil actors of that time: with Gemini Ganesan in Kalyana Parisu (1959), with Sivaji Ganesan in Bhaaga Pirivinai (1959) and again with MGR in Thirudadhe (1961). Her involvement in Tamil films also continued with superhits like Palum Pazhamum (1961), Vazhkai Vazhvatharke (1964), Aalayamani (1962), Periya Idathu Penn (1963), Puthiya Paravai (1964), Panakkara Kudumbam (1964), Enga Veetu Pillai (1965) and Anbe Vaa (1966). She came to be known as a \\"lucky mascot\\" for MGR films and acted with him in 26 films. Her early successes in Kannada cinema included Chintamani (1957), School Master (1958) and Jagajyothi Basveshwara (1959). Her role as a patriotic anti-British queen in the Kannada Kittooru Rani Chennamma (1961) was widely acclaimed. In 1964, she and Kalyan Kumar acted in the first full-fledged Kannada colour movie Amarashilpi Jakanachaari. Saroja Devi also achieved success in Telugu films, starring opposite N. T. Rama Rao in Seetarama Kalyanam (1961), Jagadeka Veeruni Katha (1961) and Daagudu Moothalu (1964). Amara Shilpi Jakkanna (1964, remake of Kannada film) and Rahasyam, her film Pelli Kaanuka (1960) with Akkineni Nageswara Rao, were also successful. The first Telugu film featured dubbing; wherein, Krishna Kumari dubbed her voice in Panduranga Mahatyam (1957). But in the subsequent years, Saroja Devi learnt Telugu language. Her Hindi films included Sasural (1960), Opera House (1961), Pareeksha, Hong Kong (1962) and Pyar Kiya To Darna Kya (1963), which became successful. In 1962 she was crowned \\"Chaturbhaasha Taare\\", because of her popularity in these four languages.

The women adored her dressing sense and her saris and blouses, ornaments, hairstyles were copied by girls and women. In the 1960s, Saroja Devi became a fashion icon among the South Indian women, who mimicked her saris, blouses, jewellery, hairstyles and mannerisms. In particular, her saris and jewellery from the Tamil movies Enga Veettu Pillai (1965) and Anbe Vaa (1966) were popularized widely in magazines. The pairing of Sivaji Ganesan and Saroja Devi gave 22 back-to-back hit movies: 1: Thangamalai Ragasiyam (1957), 2: Sabaash Meena (1958), 3: Engal Kudumbam Perisu (1958), 4: Bhaaga Pirivinai (1959), 5: School Master (Hindi) (1959), 6: Irumbu Thirai (1960), 7: Vidivelli (1960), 8: Palum Pazhamum (1961), 9: Paarthaal Pasi Theerum (1962), 10: Valar Pirai (1962), 11: Aalayamani (1962), 12: Kulamagal Radhai (1963), 13: Iruvar Ullam (1963), 14: Kalyaniyin Kanavan (1963) and 15: Puthiya Paravai (1964) === Post-marriage career === After 1968, Saroja Devi's career in Tamil cinema gradually declined, and she became more active in Kannada movies. With her marriage in 1967 and the rise of younger heroines like K. R. Vijaya and Jayalalithaa producers stopped pairing her opposite MGR. Her last film with MGR was Arasa Kattalai (1967), which also starred Jayalalithaa. She continued starring in Tamil movies opposite Sivaji Ganesan after her marriage: 16: En Thambi (1968), 17: Anbalippu (1969), 18: Anjal Petti 520 (1969), 19: Arunodhayam (1971), 20: Thenum Paalum (1971), 21: Paarambariyam (1993) and 22: Once More (1997).

Muthuraman, she starred in Arunodhayam (1971), Uyir (1971) and Pathu Matha Bandham (1974), which was her last Tamil film as a lead actor until 1985. She continued to be among the highest-paid actresses in Kannada and Telugu films. She was cast opposite the leading actor Dr. Rajkumar in several Kannada films, including Mallammana Pavada (1969), Nyayave Devaru (1971), Sri Srinivasa Kalyana (1974), Babruvahana (1977) and Bhagyavantharu (1977). Her other successful films from this period include Thande Makkalu (1971), Papa Punya (1971), Gunavanthudu (1975), Katha Sangama (1976), Sri Renukadevi Mahathme (1977), with Chiranjeevi, then with Vishnuvardhan in Shani Prabhava (1977) and Rudranaga (1984). In Telugu cinema, she was cast opposite N. T. Rama Rao in films like Bhagyachakram (1968), Uma Chandi Gowri Sankarula Katha (1968), Vijayam Manade (1970), Mayani Mamatha (1970), Shakuntala and Daana Veera Soora Karna (1979). In her long career she chiefly opted for romantic films only in the 1960s and later sentimental and socially relevant films right from the late 1960s to the 1980s. Sri Renukadevi Mahathme, a Kannada film released in 1977 was Saroja Devi's 150th film in her career and by 1984, she had completed 161 films as the main lead heroine, without ever playing supporting roles. Yarivanu, in Kannada, was the 161st film, in which she played the main lead heroine. === After husband's death === Saroja Devi signed up for the film Ladies Hostel in 1985, but stopped shooting after her husband fell ill. He subsequently died in 1986, and she resumed shooting only in 1987. The film was successful, but Saroja Devi refused to sign up for any more films. She completed the 8 films that she had accepted before 1986, and these films were released during 1987–1990. These included Thaimel Aanai (1988) and Dharma Devan (1989). She returned to acting on insistence by film producers and her fans. She starred opposite Sivaji Ganesan in Parambariyam (1993), and then performed a few roles as a supporting actress. In Kannada films, her notable supporting performances included her roles in Anuraga Sangama (1995) and Agni IPS (1997). She and Sivaji Ganesan acted in the Tamil film Once More (1997), which also includes scenes from their 1963 film Iruvar Ullam. Her latest film in Tamil was the film Aadhavan (2009), in which she played a judge's mother. Twice in 1998 and 2005, Saroja Devi chaired 45th National Film Awards and 53rd National Film Awards jury. She served as the vice-president of Kannada Chalanchitra Sangha, and as a member of Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams's local advisory committee. She runs a successful business. She also served as the Chairperson of the Karnataka Film Development Corporation, which had been set up as a private limited company by her and a few other film personalities in 1972. Saroja Devi is now settled in Bangalore, where she is involved in social work. She has organized many donation camps in the name of her husband and her mother. She is also involved with charitable trusts, rehabilitation centers and health programs. Her most recent work is Natasaarvabhowma, which released in 2019. == Personal life == Saroja Devi had an arranged marriage with Sri Harsha, a Bharat Electronics engineer from her own Gowda caste, https://starofmysore.com/interview-with-b-saroja-devi-the- queen-of-tamil-cinema-1/ on 1 March 1967. At that time, she was facing a financial crisis and income tax troubles. Her husband helped her overcome these problems, and taught her how to manage her finances. When she was asked in an interview as to how she did not discontinue acting due to her mother's insistence after 1967, she quoted: \\"Dilip Kumar once said he has asked Saira Banu to not to stop acting profession. The same thing was mentioned by Rajesh Khanna to my husband Sri Harsha not to stop me from acting.\\". Her husband hence encouraged her to continue acting from 1970, and their marriage lasted till his death in 1986. Saroja Devi's children included her daughter Bhuvaneshwari and two grandchildren Indira and Gautam. Bhuvaneshwari was her niece, and had been adopted by her.

The International Campaign for Tibet (ICT) is a non-profit advocacy group working to promote democratic freedoms for Tibetans, ensure their human rights, and protect Tibetan culture and the environment. Founded in 1988, ICT is the world's largest Tibet-related NGO, with several thousand members and strong bases of support in North America and Europe. On March 15, 2018, the ICT completed 30 years of service to the Tibetan community and received a video message from the Dalai Lama. ICT also released its new logo. An event was also held in the United States Congress on March 6, 2018 to mark the event with Congressional leaders Nancy Pelosi, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Jim McGovern, ICT Chairman Richard Gere, Representative Ngodup Tsering and ICT Board Member Tempa Tsering making remarks. ICT maintains offices in Washington D.C., Amsterdam, Brussels and Berlin. ICT's work focuses on three main areas: reporting on the situation inside Tibet, advocating for Tibet with governments, and reaching out to Chinese individuals, organizations, and media entities. ==Profile== The International Campaign for Tibet works to promote self-determination, human rights, and democratic freedoms for the Tibetan people, and negotiations between the 14th Dalai Lama and the People's Republic of China. The three main departments of ICT are devoted to reporting and communications, advocacy, and Chinese outreach. Monitoring and reporting on human rights, environmental and socio-economic conditions in Tibet makes up a significant portion of ICT's activities, with information coming directly from inside Tibet and also from a network of Tibetan researchers based in India and Nepal. ICT advocacy efforts are focused on securing humanitarian and development assistance for Tibetans, and working with governments to develop policies and programs to help Tibetans. ICT asks its members to petition governments on behalf of Tibet, and organizes activities like the annual Tibet Lobby Day which gives constituents a chance to directly ask their representatives to help Tibet. Additional advocacy efforts are focused on achieving the release of Tibetans imprisoned for their political or religious beliefs. Through Chinese Outreach, ICT engages Chinese thinkers and the broader Chinese public with the goal of increasing mutual understanding between Chinese and Tibetans.

He was a descendant of Melchior Hoffman; journalist Nicholas von Hoffman is his son. At the age of 17, von Hoffman—then a military cadet—disobeyed his mother's wishes and joined the Russian army during the Russo-Japanese War. For actions during the war he was awarded the Order of St. Anna. He participated in World War I, serving in the Russian army, and then under Admiral Kolchak on the White Russian side in the Russian Civil War. Von Hoffman is said by some sources to have been on the Roosevelt-Rondon Scientific Expedition in 1913; however, Theodore Roosevelt does not mention him in his memoir of the expedition, but footage proving von Hoffman's presence can be found here. Von Hoffman was an explorer who once led a safari from Cape Town, South Africa, to Cairo—a walk that took him three years and was the basis of his two books, Jungle Gods (New York, H. Holt and Company [c1929]) and Jerry on Safari: A 7,000 Mile Journey from Cairo to the Cape (Philadelphia: J. B. Lippincott Company, 1936). Von Hoffman's photographs of the Mexican Revolution and of Theodore Roosevelt were celebrated; his photographs of Roosevelt and Pancho Villa were exhibited in 2002 at the Martin & Osa Johnson Safari Museum. He was the cinematographer for films including The Life of General Villa, (1914,), featuring Pancho Villa himself. The movie was produced by D. W. Griffith. Von Hoffman often said his knowledge of the use of machine guns was one of the things Griffiths offered Villa to gain his participation in the movie. (In 2003, the filming of the documentary about Villa was turned into a TV movie, And Starring Pancho Villa as Himself, directed by Bruce Beresford and written by Larry Gelbart with the minor role of von Hoffman played by Julian Sedgwick.) Von Hoffman was also cinematographer of The Marriage Bond (1916) directed by Lawrence Marston. He was a member of the Explorers Club. He was also an Honorary Life Member and past president (1962) of the Adventurers' Club of New York.The Adventurers' Golden Jubilee 1964, The Adventures' Club, Inc., 1965.

Sir Ian Hamilton; 22. ; 23. ; 24. ; 25. . ==Early life== Von Hoffman was born in the Baltic port city of Riga on February 13, 1890, where his father was engaged as a botanist and forester of the then vast timber holdings of the Czar. Family position enabled young Carl to enter the Third Military Academy in St. Petersburg. It was also this family position and acquaintance with many of the ship's captains plying between this port and England with their cargoes of lumber that secured for Carl an invitation to sail to England which he eagerly accepted after securing leave from the Academy and having reached the age of 17. While aboard ship in Liverpool, he developed an interest and engaged in conversations about the great ships berthed nearby that were to sail to the United States. The captain offered to arrange a free passage to New York and this opportunity was also accepted by the adventurous Carl. Having no money, he was able to borrow $300 from the captain and set sail at once for America. ==Arrival in New York== Upon arrival in New York, he briefly explored the city and shortly decided not to return but to remain in the United States. It was fortunate that a German family who had once lived on their property and had immigrated earlier were now in New York, and there he stayed. All of this activity was not easily cast aside by his family who attempted to exert pressure on him to return by way of the then American Ambassador known to the family. Having no knowledge of the English language, he secured a correspondence course in an attempt to learn and which, though difficult, began his mastery of the language. Being low in funds, he accepted work in what could now be referred to as a sweatshop where men's shirts were manufactured, and almost all of the workers spoke Russian. The work was to unroll material on near block-long benches and prepare it for the cutters. During all of this time, his family continued efforts to secure his return by contact with the Russian Ambassador—all to no avail. His decision had been made. ==Photography apprenticeship== As the result of his amateur knowledge and interest in photography, he was fortunate to be able to secure an apprenticeship with Brown Brothers, a photographic company. At this time in our history, it was common for newspapers to give photo assignments to an independent company to complete for them. After serving an apprenticeship with Brown Brothers, he learned that the New York Globe wanted to have their own staff photographer. As the Globe was aware of some of the outstanding work he had done with Brown Brothers, he was offered the job. The year was 1910. The job, press photographer. One of his early tasks while with The Globe, was to establish a darkroom, as the photographers of that era had to do all of their own lab work. He continued to secure outstanding news photographs but was still handicapped by the language barrier, as it was also required at that time that the photographer provide captions for their work, Fortunately a noted cartoonist named Walter Davenport became friendly with the young photographer and assisted him developing the titles. This same employer, the Globe, late in 1910, provided additional opportunity for adventure when the editor advised him he was to be assigned overseas to cover a story in the then virtually unheard of city of Timbuktu. Carl, not being sure if this was a practical joke or not, went at once to his cartoonist friend Davenport and told him the good news. It was then he learned that Timbuktu was in the grips of the bubonic plague and no one else would accept the assignment. He set sail with a group of Catholic missionaries assigned to provide medical aid. The group sailed first to England and then to Africa's west coast. The final leg of the trip overland was completed by camel caravan. The assignment was to record on film the work of the missionaries and the burning of the huts and possessions of those who had fallen victim to the plague. They attempted to minimize the possibility of becoming victims themselves by staying out of the huts and observing the best sanitary methods they could muster, there being no protection known at the time except the torch. Upon his return to The Globe from the Timbuktu assignment, the paper moved to new quarters and Carl made contact with a company that was to provide him with the opportunity to learn the art of moviemaking. This opportunity provided the basics to launch him on a decades-long career as a pioneer in the art of making documentary films. ==Mutual Film Company== While employed by the Mutual Film Company, Carl was chosen to accompany the Teddy Roosevelt ill-fated expedition on the River of Doubt in the Brazilian jungle. Upon arrival at the last deep forest jumping- off spot, it was learned that inadequate provision had been made to transport anyone but Colonel Roosevelt, Kermit Roosevelt, and an Army General, along with their personal photographer, leaving Carl to return to the main base with the film taken up to that point. Later it was learned that as the expedition was returning down river, an overburdened canoe swamped and all the film taken was lost. The only photo record of the expedition was safely in Carl's camera. From this activity, Carl received an assignment from D. W. Griffith to gather factual films of Pancho Villa for use in a film. For this, Poncho Villa was to be paid $25,000. This would permit Carl to travel with him to various camps and film their activity. The plans were for a one-year project, but this was cut short after about nine months when Carl became privy to the information that the go-between had pocketed $10,000 and misinformed Poncho as to the amount paid. It was learned that there was a plan afoot to have a rifleman stationed on a hillside shoot Carl while he was operating his camera, thereby eliminating the threat of his revealing this information to Poncho with whom Carl had developed a friendship and closeness. At this point in history, there were a number of persons who had the technical and mechanical knowledge of the equipment, but they were not photographers. The artistic approach was missing, such as the use of close-ups and varied camera angles. Having learned the basics, Carl applied to an independent firm for a job as a cameraman and after testing his work was given the assignment to cover the Wilson inauguration though he was still on the staff of The Globe. It was during this assignment, through friends in Washington, that he was able to photograph Mr. Taft on his last visit to church as the president was removing his hat. This had never been photographed before, as Taft expressly forbade such photos. The coverage of the inaugural parade was viewed at the ground level where he could photograph the crowd reactions, children on the curb, and vendors selling their wares, as well as the procession. This gave a human, artistic touch not heretofore found in news films---the first human interest introduced to these films. ==Assignments in the East== On the basis of the exceptional quality and technique displayed, he was given a full-time staff position by Universal. The first assignment from this company was to take the first motion pictures of the United States fleet on maneuvers. A number of years later, while on a lecture tour of Japan, von Hoffman came upon the idea of visiting Taiwan, which was then called Formosa and under Japanese control, and had wild areas not heretofore explored or photographed. Entry was not encouraged by the government, and in fact no foreigners were permitted. This made it all the more appealing to him, and by trickery he secured a ticket for passage on a government boat, with professors en route there to service the small educational system the Japanese maintained on the island. His exploration of this region permitted him to record on film some of the rites of the tribes of headhunters still living in the remote mountain areas. This seven-month effort produced a remarkable film shown at the Explorers Club. The visit also permitted him to secure a collection of treasured artifacts relating to the lives of these people and produced a lecture series on the subject. Earlier, with his technique improving, Carl decided to make an independent film which was an anthropological and ethnological documentary on Morocco entitled \\"Land of the Moors\\" which was later featured at the Strand Theater in New York. This effort was the beginning of his deep involvement as a pioneer of documentary and educational films of primitive people, their land, and customs. These films were produced by the Urban Institute, which Carl joined, headed by Sir Charles Urban, and it was this company that expanded the use of documentary films and later its own motion picture color process. This visit produced a number of interesting encounters, among them being the guest of the Pasha for a dinner consisting of endless courses eaten with fingers instead of utensils. It. was after such a dinner, when the many wives of the host were gathered, that the Pasha revealed that one of the guests was originally from Russia and had a Georgian mother. This was, of course, particularly interesting to the gathering, as it was common at that time for them to buy their wives in Georgia and transport them home for the wedding ceremony on the backs of small desert donkeys, a long trip by any standard. Shortly after this encounter, a small messenger delivered a note to Carl on the back of some wrapping paper. He was requested, in Russian, to follow the young boy, who would call for him the next morning, and subsequently meet the mystery author of the note. The following day, he did as asked, and was taken to a small hut in the village where he was instructed to remove his western-style clothing in exchange for a flowing caftan, veil, and special sandals. The footwear was of special significance to Carl as each pair bore the family identification in Arabic and he had no idea just which family name he bore. Having donned the perfect disguise, and being assured in sign language that his effects would be safe, the boy beckoned him to follow. They followed a circuitous route, finally arriving at one of the entrances to the home of the Pasha. The boy had access to the area and they walked past Arabs sitting along the passageways who did not give them a second glance. They shortly arrived at the servants' entrance, passed through, and entered the main building complex. The area had many smaller buildings and areas which were occupied by the many wives, each having her own apartment and servants. It is important to note that the servants were completely devoted to the wife they served and conspiracies against husbands were carried out with their assistance. Finally, after being settled in one of these apartments by the servants, the lady of the house appeared and addressed him in Russian. She went on to explain that her husband, the host of the previous evening's dinner, had told her about Carl and his Russian background and the fact that his mother was a Georgian from a prominent family which she recognized. It was upon hearing this that she decided she must see him and began the plot to smuggle him into the harem area. The family where the costume change occurred were the parents of one of her house servants and also loyal. Carl had managed to conceal a camera within his flowing robes and was able to take one photo of the three women sitting in the apartment while visiting. He was then told the story of the Georgian wife being sold to her husband and her donkey caravan trip to her current home in the harem. At a later date, he made a second visit, though to be exposed would have meant beheading. The film, when completed, was not only one of the prominent achievements in the making of documentary films, but provided the subject matter for a series of lectures within the United States and Europe. A little known fact was that a considerable amount of footage was taken with cameraman Von Hoffman looking toward the' rear of the camera. By religious custom, the Moroccans frowned upon reproducing their image on film, and would hide. To overcome this, Carl devised a mirror on the camera to enable him to look backwards, quieting any suspicions the populace had that they were being photographed. Furthermore, it caused many to follow his backward gaze, thereby looking directly into the camera, producing some outstanding footage. ==Trek in Africa== During 1924, Carl was approached by a group of four businessmen from Detroit and invited to participate in an African trek from Cairo to Cape Town completely on foot, a distance of slightly over 7,000 miles, ultimately taking 11 months to complete. This was the longest trek in the history of exploration. The group, which consisted of a doctor, realtor, lawyer, and the inventor of the Packard 12-cylinder automobile, felt the need of a professional explorer, hence Carl's participation. The purpose of the trip was the sheer accomplishment of the act for all except Carl who wanted the films that such a trip could generate. The group sailed from New York to England shortly before Christmas in 1924. Upon arrival in England, they separated with three of the group going to Paris. Carl and the doctor remained behind to secure medical information relative to protection from tropical diseases. They experienced much difficulty in reaching the doctor having the needed information, and had abandoned hope of making contact, when a last-minute call before leaving for the airport found him in his office. A forgotten Christmas gift had caused the doctor to return to his Office at the moment of their last telephone attempt. This contact caused them to cancel their air passage. The flight they cancelled caught fire in air and crashed en route with the loss of all aboard. This minor change in plans was unknown to the remainder of the group in Paris, who believing them lost, were cancelling plans to complete the expedition. Their arrival was quite a shock to the others the next morning. The trek followed a relatively direct course with large numbers of porters engaged to move the supplies south. The porters carried only to their territorial borders. Fortunately, contacts with Colonial commissioners gave them the opportunity to have the needed manpower available at each border. Porters carried 50 pounds each on their heads and were paid in salt and calico cloth. As supplies diminished, less porters were required. While traveling in the areas having a heavy infestation of malaria, they traveled at night, as the mosquitoes and tsetse flies were not as active during this period. The only problem with this hiking technique was that while the insects slept, the leopard and lion became active. It was not uncommon for a tribal commissioner to travel part of the distance with the safari as a show of good will. This gesture and lack of vigilance caused one commissioner to be badly mauled by a lion that pulled him from his horse and dragged him into the bush. (His head was held so tightly to the animal's body he could hear the lion's heart beat. The man's great strength enabled him to plunge a knife into the lion and kill it before being eaten. At that time, this was the only recorded case of man's survival in hand-to-hand combat with a lion. A return visit to what was then Rhodesia provided the research data for Carl's book Jungle Gods, which was printed in several languages. The book follows the religious rites and customs of a single African tribe for a full year. It was during this period that Carl was able to spend much time with the native population and study in depth their way of life and rituals, probably never before witnessed by a white man. He is also author of Jerry on Safari, a book for young people. ==Australian Outback== Carl later visited the Australian Outback in an attempt to photograph the life of the Aborigines. While this produced much footage recorded for the first time, it proved extremely difficult, since the Aborigine was nomadic and with no village life at that time, only scattered glimpses were possible. Prior to his leaving for Australia, the Bronx Zoo commissioned him to bring back a group of animals and snakes sought for display. Due to the care and planning Carl brought to the venture, none of the animals were lost on the journey home, much to the amazement of zoo officials. The return voyage took the ship past Pitcairn Island and the captain received a telegram from the island that the people would like to see the kangaroos. As these animals were kept on deck, the ship slowed when it reached the island, and the residents paddled out in canoes to go aboard to see the kangaroos and other animals stored topside. For this gesture, Carl was presented a handsome urn carved of mahogany by the islanders. Carl was also responsible for developing many photographic techniques and equipment. Among these was his participation in the development of the early phases of the syncro flash, which undoubtedly opened many new avenues to the photographer. ==Personal life== Carl often recalls the many colorful and prominent early Explorers Club members with whom he had a close relationship, such as Martin Johnson, Peter Freuchen, Lowell Thomas, Bernt Balchen, and others. As a friend of Martin Johnson, he attempted to prevail upon him to remain in New York for the Annual Dinner on the eve of Johnson's fateful flight. Unable to stay the extra day, he left and was aboard the flight that resulted in his death. Martin Johnson died in the crash of a Western Air Express Boeing 247 commercial flight near Newhall, California in 1937. In addition to work in the fields of ethnology, anthropology and cinematology, that has seen him carry the Explorers Club flag into far-flung places and visits to primitive people, he was the founder of the Club's Safari Dinners. These dinners were a popular feature of the lecture series for a long time. Some of the specialties at these dinners might be such items as: giant salmon (from Alaska); a variety of big game (provided by friends); cases of beer (from a Scandinavian source); and last, but not least, Carl's famous cream cheese and peanut butter spread dip. He also initiated many of the early annual dinners held at the Plaza, which were a great success. His legendary devotion to the Explorers Club as committee chairman and board member is well known. Over the years, his untiring efforts and presence at Club functions and work projects have contributed much to the Club and its members. His friendship with Albert Einstein and the brother of the Dali (sic) Lama brought them to the Explorers Club to attend lectures, which events have been remembered by those members of long standing. An in-depth conversation with Carl has been taped over a period of months. These tapes cover most of his activities, including a stint while still a cadet in the Russo-Japanese War in 1904, winning the medal of St. George for getting a vital message through the lines, and later his experience in the revolution and his miraculous recovery from typhus fever in the last days of the Russian revolution in Siberia. Carl had served as a Lieutenant in the U. S. Signal Corp during World War I and after the Armistice had joined an American unit to fight in the White Army with Admiral Kolchak. These tapes are in greater detail than this account and will be made part of the Explorers Club Archives. ==Notes== From an article, written by George E. Duck, published in the Explorers Journal, Official Quarterly of the Explorers Club, Volume 60, No. 2, June 1982.

Historic garden conservation is a specialised type of historic preservation and conservation or restoration concerned with historical and landmark gardens and designed landscapes. ==Profession== Practitioners predominantly come from backgrounds in horticulture, garden design, landscape design, and landscape architecture. To prepare a management plan for a historic garden, such experts require knowledge and skills in environmental design, horticulture, landscape history, architectural history, and management. Specialist educational programs are available (see section below). One of most famous historical landscape architects, Lancelot \\"Capability\\" Brown (1716 - 1783). Historic garden restoration is the professional task of restoring historic gardens to the character they had at a previous point in history. Since the use of old gardens is in flux, this normally involves a consideration of current and future use. The job of researching historic gardens and preparing a policy for their conservation involves landscape archaeology, historic knowledge, design judgment and technical skill in horticulture and construction. ==Education== ===United Kingdom=== Several universities and colleges in England run undergraduate and postgraduate courses related to historic garden conservation. *Institute of Historical Research - MA in garden and landscape history, Institute of Historical Research (London) *University of Greenwich - BSc landscape management course, University of Greenwich *Institute of Continuing Education - historic environment (landscapes and gardens) courses, Institute of Continuing Education (Cambridge) *Writtle College - BSc garden design, restoration & management, Writtle College *MA historic designed landscapes, Writtle College *The University of Bath ran a specialist MSc / PGDip course in the conservation of historic gardens and cultural landscapes, until the 2014-15 academic year. === France === * The Institut national du patrimoine (The National Institute of Cultural Heritage) trains curators specialized in « scientific, technical and natural heritage ». ==Public protection== ===United Kingdom=== Statutory protection exists for registered parks, gardens and designed landscapes. There are separate heritage registers maintained for each of the four countries of the United Kingdom: * The Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of special historic interest in England is maintained by English Heritage; * The Cadw/ICOMOS Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in Wales is maintained by Cadw; * The Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland is maintained by Historic Scotland; * The Register of Parks, Gardens and Demesnes of Special Historic Interest is maintained by the Northern Ireland Environment Agency. ==Organisations== ===Australia=== In Australia, the Australian Garden History Society is a similar organization to the UK's Garden History Society. ===United Kingdom=== The Baroque terraced garden at Powis Castle in Wales, restored in the early 20th century and now cared for by the National Trust. In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, the National Trust, and likewise in Scotland the National Trust for Scotland, own or manage many country houses and/or the gardens and parkland attached to them, as well as other treasured gardens, parks and landscapes, on behalf of the nation. The Garden History Society is the oldest such society in the world, forming in 1966. It became The Gardens TrustThe Gardens Trust in 2015, having merged with the Association of Gardens Trusts. Its aims are to study garden history and conserve historic gardens. Since 1995 it is a statutory consultee on proposals affecting registered parks, gardens and landscapes in England. It has about 1,500 members and publishes the Garden History journal twice-yearly, as well as a regular members' newsletter. The society has an active group for Scotland, with its own regular newsletter and conservation officer. The Welsh Historic Gardens Trust is a similar society specifically for gardens, parks and landscapes in Wales. Most of the counties of England also have their own trust, which were represented by the Association of Gardens Trusts, which since 2015 forms part of The Gardens Trust. In London there is the Garden Museum, covering all aspects of gardening history and with a large and growing collection of historic objects such as old tools and plans. ===United States=== In the United States, The Garden Conservancy actively assists in the preservation of notable gardens and designed landscapes in the country. There is also the California Garden and Landscape History Society for events and education in California specifically. The Garden Club of Virginia has restored many of the most notable historic gardens in Virginia since its founding around 1913. A Historic Garden Week is run, in part to raise money for restorations. The Archives of American Gardens is an archive which preserves documentation and content related to gardens in the United States. Housing over 80,000 photographic images and records pertaining to over 6,000 gardens throughout the United States, some as old as the 1870s, the Archive is part of Smithsonian Gardens, a unit of the Smithsonian Institution. ==Examples of restoration== ===United Kingdom=== Restoration work at Wrest Park.

Using the term underground to define a performing arts movement or scene in tha Arab world, including Tunisia, takes on a slightly different meaning compared to the one generally understood when used in the western countries. Given that contemporary Tunisian mainstream music includes only a few different musical styles, underground music has come to include any artist or band that sings or composes in a different genre. For example, while there's nothing underground about reggae on the international stage, Tunisian reggae bands may still be considered part of the Tunisian underground scene. The underground music scene in Tunisia is growing fast, and in the past two decades there has been a considerable increase in the number of bands trying out all sorts of musical genres, moving the boundaries of what is considered underground. ==Heavy metal== Metal band Myrath performing in Madrid, 2016 The most active scene is arguably that of Tunisian heavy metal bands, most notably Myrath, but also Persona, Nawather, Carthagods and Ymyrgar. Most of these bands sing in English and sometimes include Arabic sentences in the chorus of their songs. While several bands compose their own music, many of them perform covers. ==Rap== In contrast to Tunisian heavy metal bands, most Tunisian rappers perform in Tunisian (the local Arabic dialect). The Tunisian rap scene is very productive but it is still widely based on self-producing MCs such as Wled Bled Crew (Balti...), T-man (Nizar...), Arab Clan (Karoura...),Warda Crew (Wistar...),Slim Larnaaout, Kamel Zmen, La Masse, Crach 13 ( BmG...), Armada Bizerta plus a growing number of music producers known by their unique sound quality and creativity such as Dj Killer, Dj Momo. ==Electronic music== Electronic music also took place in the scene, and many Tunisian DJs and producers are participating not only on the local scene but also on the international one. Since the Electro and trance \\"craze\\" gave its fans to Deep House and Tech house and some Techno, Minimal and Dubstep making a larger and open minded scene, which helped to create new concepts that unites the underground scene together.

Notable for its flowerlike shape, it has become a prominent attraction in the city. Like all Baháʼí Houses of Worship, the Lotus Temple is open to all, regardless of religion or any other qualification. The building is composed of 27 free-standing marble-clad \\"petals\\" arranged in clusters of three to form nine sides, with nine doors opening onto a central hall with a height of slightly over 34.27 metres and a capacity of 2,500 people. The Lotus Temple has won numerous architectural awards and has been featured in many newspaper and magazine articles. A 2001 CNN report referred to it as the most visited building in the world. ==Worship== The Baháʼí Faith teaches that a Baháʼí House of Worship should be a space for people of all religions to gather, reflect, and worship. Anyone may enter the Lotus Temple irrespective of religious background, sex, or other distinctions, as is the case with all Baháʼí houses of worship. The sacred writings of not only the Baháʼí faith but also other religions can be read and/or chanted, regardless of language; on the other hand, reading nonscriptural texts is forbidden, as are delivering sermons or lectures, or fund-raising. Musical renditions of readings and prayers can be sung by choirs, but no musical instruments can be played inside. There is no set pattern for worship services, and ritualistic ceremonies are not permitted. ==Structure== All Baháʼí Houses of Worship, including the Lotus Temple, share certain architectural elements, some of which are specified by Baháʼí scripture. ʻAbdu'l-Bahá, the son of the founder of the religion, stipulated that an essential architectural character of a House of Worship is a nine- sided circular shape. While all current Baháʼí Houses of Worship have a dome, this is not regarded as an essential part of their architecture.Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer, Lights of Divine Guidance (volume 1), pg 311 Baháʼí scripture also states that no pictures, statues or images be displayed within the House of Worship and no pulpits or altars be incorporated as an architectural feature (readers may stand behind simple portable lecture stands). Model of the temple at the information centre Inspired by the lotus flower, the design for the House of Worship in New Delhi is composed of 27 free-standing marble-clad \\"petals\\" arranged in clusters of three to form nine sides. The nine doors of the Lotus Temple open onto a central hall slightly more than 40 metres tall that can seat 1,300 people and hold up to 2,500 in all. The surface of the House of Worship is made of white marble from Penteli mountain in Greece, the same marble used in the construction of many ancient monuments (including the Parthenon) and other Baháʼí buildings. Along with its nine surrounding ponds and gardens, the Lotus Temple property comprises 26 acres (105,000 m²; 10.5 ha). Lotus temple is situated near Okhla NSIC and Kalkaji Mandir metro station is just 500 meters away. The temple is located in the village of Bahapur in New Delhi, National Capital Territory of Delhi. The architect was an Iranian, Fariborz Sahba who now lives in La Jolla, California, after living some years in Canada. He was approached in 1976 to design the Lotus Temple and later oversaw its construction. The structural design was undertaken by the UK firm Flint and Neill over the course of 18 months, and the construction was done by ECC Construction Group of Larsen & Toubro Limited at a cost of $10 million. The major part of the funds needed to buy this land was donated by Ardishír Rustampúr of Hyderabad, Sindh, whose will dictated that his entire life savings would go to this purpose. A portion of the construction budget was saved and used to build a greenhouse to study indigenous plants and flowers that would be appropriate for use on the site. Of the temple's total electricity use of 500 kilowatts (kW), 120 kW is provided by solar power generated by solar panels on the building. This saves the temple 120,000 rupees per month. It is the first temple in Delhi to use solar power. ==Tourism== The Baháʼí House of Worship in Delhi was opened to public worship in December 1986.

The battle saw the death of Polish Army colonel Berek Joselewicz, fighting against Austrian Empire for the freedom of Poland. ==Course== Lieutenant Colonel Berek Joselewicz was in command of a squadron of the 5th Regiment of Mounted Riflemen in the vanguard of the Polish Army and forming part of cavalry brigadier general Rożnieckiego's formation. The Polish cavalry had been tasked with clearing Austrian troops out of the way of the main force and capturing crossings over the river Wieprz. The only Austrian forces in the area withdrew to Kock on 2 May - this was formed of two squadrons (totalling around 300 men) of the 1st Hussars, commanded by major Friedrich Hoditz. The force was tasked with destroying all the crossings over the Wieprz. On 7 May Joselewicz attacked the Austrians at the head of his squadron. After a brief struggle, the hussars retreated in disarray and the bridge was captured intact. Joselewicz was killed - pursuing the fleeing hussars too closely, he was wounded, surrounded and killed despite pleading to surrender. His precise gravesite is unknown, though a cenotaph to him stands on the road between Kock and Bialobrzegi. Polish casualties were 1 dead and 7 injured, whilst the Austrians lost 11 killed, 8 wounded and 8 captured, including one captain. After the battle Hoditz withdrew towards Lublin.

Primarily a fast bowler bowling late away-swingers with a high action, he took 30 wickets in Tests. Perhaps his finest moment was taking 11 wickets for the New Zealanders against MCC at Lord's in 1958. ==Cricket career== Hayes was born in Auckland. He made his first-class debut for Auckland in December 1946. After only two first-class matches, and with the team looking for someone to support the aging Jack Cowie, he played in a trial match in January 1949 for the New Zealand side that toured England that year. He took five wickets for 73, and was selected for the tour led by Walter Hadlee. He took 26 wickets at a bowling average of 33 before a groin injury in July ruled him out for the remainder of the tour. John Reid rated him as the fastest bowler of the 1949 English season.Joseph Romanos, John Reid: A Cricketing Life, Hodder Moa Beckett, Auckland, 2000, p. 212. Nicknamed \\"Haybag\\", he made his Test debut against England at Christchurch in March 1951. He played against the touring West Indies team in 1951–52, but his job obliged him to miss the tour to South Africa in 1953–54. He played at home again against the touring English team in 1954–55, and toured to Pakistan and India in 1955–56. He missed playing in New Zealand's first Test victory, against the West Indies at Auckland in March 1956, and played his last four Tests on the tour to England in 1958, ending his Test career in the Fourth Test at Old Trafford. He was never on the winning side in a Test Match. Hayes was New Zealand Cricket Almanack's Player of the Year in 1958. He played his last first-class match for the New Zealand Governor-General's XI against the touring MCC in Auckland in February 1961. ==After cricket== Outside cricket, he worked for a firm of importers and exporters in Auckland.

He is best known for his Puritan beliefs, his study of insects and arthropods in regard to medicine (particularly spiders), his support of the Paracelsian system of medicine, and his emphasis on the importance of experience over reputation in the field of medicine. ==Biography== ===Early life and education=== Thomas Muffet was born in 1553 as the second son to haberdasher Thomas Moffet, in Shoreditch, London. From the ages 8 to 16, Muffet attended the Merchant Taylors' School. In May 1569, he matriculated at Trinity College, Cambridge but transferred to Gonville Hall in October 1572. He graduated in 1573, when he received his bachelor's degree. Afterward, Muffet studied medicine with Thomas Lorkin and John Caius. Three years later, he began his master's degree at Trinity and was expelled from Gonville. In Spring 1578 Muffet boarded with Felix Platter, chief physician of Basel, where he adopted the Paracelsian system of medicine.American Council of Learned Societies, Concise dictionary of scientific biography, Scribner's, 2000, , p. 612. In 1579, Muffet was awarded a doctorate in medicine from Basel University. His thesis was entitled De amodinis medicamentis (1578). ===Later life and post-graduate work=== Published title page of Theatrum Insectorum (Theatre of Insects) The year after receiving his MD, in 1580, Thomas Muffet studied silkworm anatomy in Italy before finally returning to England. That December, Muffet married his first wife, Jane, in St Mary Colechurch, London. Two years later, he was recognized as a qualified physician by the College of Physicians in London. This was not expected, as Muffet was a strong advocate for the Paracelsian system of medicine, which was not widely respected by the medical community. The same year, Muffet was sent by Sir Francis Walsingham on a diplomatic mission to Denmark to present the Order of the Garter to King Frederick. It was here he met both Tycho Brahe and Petrus Severinus, though there is no evidence as to either's intellectual influence upon him. Two years later, in 1584, Muffet finished his De jure et praestantia chemicorum medicamentorum. This document is said to have anticipated Bacon's emphasis on the advancement of learning. That same year, Muffet wrote a letter attacking the London College of Physicians for Papist influences through the lens of his own Puritan beliefs. The following year, however, he was admitted to the College of Physicians, becoming a fellow in February 1588. Later in 1588, Muffet published his Nosomantica Hippocratea, advocating support for the work and writings of Hippocrates. Nine years later, in October 1597, Muffet was elected as a Member of Parliament for Wilton. Three years later, in 1600, Muffet's wife, Jane, died. He married widow Catherine Brown that same year. Thomas Muffet died at the Bulbridge Farm, in Wilton, Wiltshire on 5 June 1604. ==Scientific contributions== ===Insects=== Thomas Muffet first studied silkworms while working in Italy, beginning his continued fascination with arthropods in general, particularly spiders. He is best known for editing and expanding the work Insectorum sive Minimorum Animalium Theatrum (Theatre of Insects), an illustrated guide to the classification and lives of insects. Although he is popularly believed to have authored it, he merely inherited and furthered its progress toward publication, which would not occur until thirty years after his death. The book contained significant contributions by other scientists, notably the Swiss scientist Conrad Gesner (1516–65). The prime reason it was published posthumously was that the English market for books on natural science was weak at the time. It appears that it was ready for the press in 1589 or 1590. The original title page (unused) is dated 1589. His negotiations with printers in The Hague failed in 1590. The original illustrations were given up as too expensive and replaced with the wood cuts that appear in the 1634 edition. There is the possibility that the same work appears under the name of Théodore Turquet de Mayerne (born Geneva, Switzerland, 1573 – died Chelsea, England, 1655), published in the same year, 1634. Only the introduction of this edition, however, is believed to have been written by de Mayerne.Matthew, H. C. G. and Brian Howard Harrison, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, vol. 38, , p. 54 ===Good health and nutrition=== Muffet's work in nutrition was collected in his book Health's Improvement which was designed more for the layman than for contemporary medical professionals. It contains the first list of British wildfowl, recognizing for the first time the migratory habits of many of them. This book was published even later than Theatrum Insectorum, not until 1655, in an edition edited by Christopher Bennet. ==Nursery rhyme connection== It has been suggested that Muffet is the subject of the nursery rhyme 'Little Miss Muffet', which, it is argued refers to an incident with one of his stepchildren. Although the name and subject fit the verse, there is no clear evidence of a connection and the verse was only printed in 1805.I. Opie and P. Opie, The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1951, 2nd edn., 1997), pp. 323–4. ==Notes== ==Sources== *Charles C. Gillispie, Ed.

Zippy is a light-orange (“tangerine”) puppet with a rugby-ball-shaped oval head, blue eyes and a zip for a mouth, hence his name. His voice was first provided by Peter Hawkins and later by Roy Skelton. Violet Philpott and Ronnie Le Drew operated the character, the latter also providing the voice for the 1994 series and Rainbow Days. It is unclear what kind of creature the character represents; while Bungle is a bear and George a hippopotamus, Zippy bears no obvious resemblance to any real animal. Presenter Geoffrey Hayes has said of him, \\"I don't think anyone has a clue what he's meant to be.\\" ==Personality== Zippy (with George) at the National Media Museum The character is the best known character from the show. Zippy claims to be the best at whatever is being discussed, and always claims to be right. He loves to eat sweets, sing songs and tell his favourite jokes, and always has to be the centre of attention. For example, the other characters might be having a discussion, when Zippy would shout: \\"But I don't want to talk, I want to sing! I'm very good at singing! [starts singing] I'm a little teapot short and stout, here's my handle and here's my spout...\\" Due to his frequently loud behaviour and silly voice getting him into all sorts of trouble, other characters in Rainbow occasionally zip his mouth shut for a short time, rendering him unable to talk. On at least one occasion he unzips himself, although he appears unable to do so on most occasions. Zippy is well known for his love of food, and in many episodes is seen eating. ==Appearance== In a The Sun tabloid newspaper article headlined \\"Revealed: Why lost star Zippy is orange\\", Zippy's orange colour is apparently due to presenter Geoffrey Hayes following Dundee United F.C. when living in Dundee, Scotland, during the 1960s and 1970s. The show's producers were set to make Zippy blue – the colour of neighbouring rivals Dundee F.C. – but Geoffrey convinced them otherwise. However, Zippy had been orange from the earliest episodes in 1972,Rainbow series 1 episode 1 - Shapes, Thames Television, transmitted on ITV 16 October 1972 (character appears from 13:13 to 15:01) over a year before Hayes joined the series.\\"Although not the first presenter of Rainbow (that honour goes to David Cook, who left at the end of series 1 {sic - he actually stayed until the end of series 2}), Geoffrey is the most widely remembered.\\" http://www.denofgeek.com/tv/rainbow/31909/looking-back-at-rainbow In a BBC online poll from March 2006, Zippy was named as Britain's favourite sporting celebrity fan by a landslide margin with 47% of the vote. Described as Dundee United's biggest fan, several newspapers including the Daily Record, The Courier and Sunday Herald also covered the story in print and online. The poll included lifelong Port Vale F.C. fan Robbie Williams and Delia Smith, a director at Norwich City F.C.. In second place with 9.74% was movie star and Sheffield United F.C. fan Sean Bean. The poll attracted more than 15,000 votes. ==Later appearances== In 2002, Zippy appeared in the \\"My Mate / I hate\\" advertising campaign for Marmite in the UK. In the TV commercial he zipped up his own mouth when confronted with Marmite, thus confirming his hate for the product. During in-character interviews on shows such as SMTV Live, Zippy is often portrayed as even more loud mouthed and crude than normal. An infamous \\"Christmas tape\\" of the series also displays cruder humour from the entire cast. In December 2007 Zippy and George appeared on a puppet special of the Weakest Link hosted by Anne Robinson. Zippy answered each of the questions asked to the pair, most of them being incorrect, and they were voted off in the third round. During a between-rounds interview, Robinson zipped up Zippy. Zippy and George appeared in the first series of the 2008-2010 BBC Kudos programme Ashes to Ashes. Zippy appeared twice in a 2008 episode of Harry Hill's TV Burp. He featured in an edited scene of EastEnders, appearing at the door after a character had been seen undoing a large number of zips when searching someone's handbag. He later appeared in a montage of television figures saying the word \\"cataracts\\". In 2009, Zippy and George appeared on Peter Kay's The Official BBC Children in Need Medley, and Zippy made an appearance on the seventh series of Celebrity Juice as the celebrity from the Glamourerer Magazine Head section of the show. The character of Zippy was retired with voice artist Roy Skelton's death in 2011. However this hasn't prevented him and George from appearing in parody sketches, performed by various imitators. Appeared on BBC Children in Need 2016. In March 2017, Zippy appeared in the second episode of John Bishop's week of hosting The Nightly Show. In October 2017, Zippy, George and Bungle appeared in the Pizza Hut advert. In November 2017, Zippy appeared on The Last Leg. ==Further reading== * Climbing High: Life Under the Rainbow Exposed by V.

In September later that year he was raised to commander, and on 26 April 1767 he was made Major General by Frederick II. At the age of 17, Colonel Hans von Blumenthal, commander of the Gardes du Corps, became the prince's governor. As a result, he and his brother Frederick William spent much time at the Colonel's estate at Paretz. Prince Henry was a promising young captain in the guards and his uncle the King had high hopes for him. However, in May 1767 he was leading his cuirassier squadron to Berlin for a parade and review when he stopped at the von Kleist estate of Protzen.

According to Erv Zube (1931–2002) landscape planning is defined as an activity concerned with developing landscaping amongst competing land uses while protecting natural processes and significant cultural and natural resources. Park systems and greenways of the type designed by Frederick Law Olmsted are key examples of landscape planning. Landscape designers tend to work for clients who wish to commission construction work. Landscape planners analyze broad issues as well as project characteristics which constrain design projects. Landscape planners may work on projects which are of broad geographical scope, concern many land uses or many clients or are implemented over a long period of time. As an example, the damage caused by unplanned mineral extraction was one of the early reasons for a public demand for landscape planning. ==In Europe== Alberti wrote on the need for town squares for markets and specific implementations to make most use of the space. In North Europe this developed into the idea that residential squares should planned around green spaces. The first space of this type was the Place des Vosges. Residential squares were also made in Britain and their planning developed into the idea of incorporating public open space (public parks within towns). Frederick Law Olmsted gave momentum to this idea with his proposal for a park systems in Boston - the famous Emerald Necklace. Patrick Abercrombie took up this idea and incorporated it in his great 1943-4 Open Space Plan for the County of London. An example of landscape planning in use is the plans of RWE in the wake of its mining operations and how they plan to use leftover detritus and soil in their re-cultivation efforts to restore the damaged ecosystems and landscapes created by open pit mines (e.g. Garzweiler surface mine) ==In the US == In the United States, landscape architects provide landscape planning services focused on the natural environment along with urban planners. But, unlike Canada and Europe, the US does not have a national land use planning system. Frederick Law Olmsted and Ian McHarg are two influential American landscape architects that also worked as planners. McHarg's work on overlay landscape planning contributed to the development of GIS and to the foundation of ESRI by Jack Dangermond. ==Legislation== The principles of landscape planning are now incorporated in various types of legislation and policy documents. In America, the National Environmental Policy Act was influenced by the work of Ian McHarg on Environmental impact assessment. In Germany, the Federal Nature Conservation Act requires the preparation of landscape plans. For the Europe Union as a whole, the European Landscape Convention has wide- ranging implications for the design and planning of relationships between development and the landscape. In Asia, major development projects are taking place and illustrating the need for good landscape planning. The Three Gorges Dam, for example, will have extensive impacts on the landscape. They have been planned to a degree but future monitoring of the project is likely to show that better landscape planning and design would have been possible. ==Methodology== The conventional planning process is a linear progression of activities. The common steps are: *Identification of problems and opportunities. *Establishment of goals. *Inventory and analysis of the biophysical environment. *Human community inventory and analysis. *Development of concepts and the selection of options. *Adoption of a plan. *Community involvement and education. *Detailed design. *Plan implementation. *Plan administration. Landscape planning not always means an ecological planning method, for that it must be considered that \\"planning is a process that uses the scientific and technical information for considering and reaching consensus on a range of choices. Ecology is the study of the relationship of all living things, including people, to their biological and physical environments. Ecological planning then may be defined as the use of biophysical and sociocultural information to suggest opportunities and constraints for decision making about the use of landscape\\". (Steiner, 1991) While the common steps are listed above, the process of Landscape planning is adaptable to many situations and is useful in many ways depending on the goals for which it is used. == Impacts & Implications == Results of proper implementations of landscape planning practices are not only limited to more functional landscapes. It can also influence for the better many aspects of the environment and community in which it is used to its potential. While the chief purpose of landscape planning is for ecological reasons it can impact so much more when used effectively as a tool. === Ecology === Landscape planning is mainly used for ecological purposes and functions best when the result of the planning process is the least amount of interruption of ecological factors from before the implementation ever went into place. In this practice landscape planning can be used to not only maintain the status of the existing environment, but also can be used to improve aspects of previously under performing ecosystems, for example, designing to increase biodiversity. For example Landscape planning could be used to create additional habitat for endangered species, and reclamation of previously used or depleted lands (e.g. old agricultural spaces) for expansion of natural ecosystems. This also includes planning in order to reduce the impact of the changes to the environment. with proper landscape planning, a greater speed of recovery for the ecosystems of interrupted spaces is achievable. === Health === similar to the impacts of healing gardens, the positive healing effects of proper implementations of planned landscapes are of great benefit. When people are exposed to nature, they would find that their overall mood had improved and that they recover from stress and illness at an accelerated rate. With the proper use of landscape planning, health within an urban leaning environment in regards to stress and recovery can be greatly improved above the unplanned alternative. When landscape planning is used to properly conserve ecological systems that may have been displaced, it makes it so recreational use of the environment is maintained while conserving the systems for people to enjoy. === Use of other technologies in context === The development of GIS technology such as those developed by ESRI, have great import to the practice of Landscape planning. Use of assisting technology allows for the conditions and factors existing in a landscape to be easily aggregated and analyzed. Through the use of GIS technology you are able to answer many of the questions about a landscape that is in question. such as, \\"how functional is this landscape?\\" or \\"to what extent do the factors outside of the site affect the planning that needs to be done?\\" The use of technology that is developing with greater and greater accuracy has the ability to make sustainable developments easier and more common across the globe. ==See also== ==Footnotes== * Landscape planning education in America: retrospect and prospect *Ecological design and planning George F.

Darboe formerly served as Barrow's Minister of Foreign Affairs from February 2017 to June 2018. Darboe is a human rights lawyer, and worked for the Attorney General's Chambers before entering private practice. He has served as advisor to several companies and government agencies, and was also for a time the vice president of the Gambia Bar Association. He founded the United Democratic Party (UDP) in 1996. It was the main opposition party under the rule of Yahya Jammeh, and Darboe himself stood in the 1996, 2001, and 2006 presidential elections. He was imprisoned in 2016, but released after Barrow's victory. == Early life and education == Darboe was born in 1948, the son of Numukunda Darboe, who served as a member of parliament for Lower Falluda West, and as communications secretary for Pierre Sarr N'Jie's United Party. Darboe attended Bansang Primary School and then proceeded to Banjul, where he studied at Saint Augustine High School and Gambia High School. Darboe was the recipient of a Commonwealth scholarship to study law at the University of Lagos in Nigeria. He also later studied a master's degree in law from the University of Ottawa, Canada. He is the first Gambian lawyer from the Mandinka ethnic group. == Legal career == Darboe was called to the Federal Bar of Nigeria in 1973 and returned to the Gambia in May 1973 to take up a role as a state prosecutor. He was called to the Gambian bar in November 1973, becoming the first Gambian lawyer from the Mandinka ethnic group. He then worked at the Attorney General's Chambers, firstly as a state counsel, then as acting registrar- general, and then as a legal draftsman, before resigning in 1980 in protests against the government's use of draconian legislation to suppress opposition. Darboe then entered a private practice, working as a human rights barrister. He founded Basansang Chambers in 1980. He was later joined as a senior partner by Neneh M.C. Cham and Lamin Darboe. Darboe is credited with having saved the lives of over 200 Gambians from the death penalty. Following the failed 1981 coup against Dawda Jawara's government, Darboe successfully defended many involved, including Pap Cheyassin Secka and Sheriff Mustapha Dibba who were both tried for treason. Darboe also represented the majority of those detained under 'Emergency Powers' following the coup. He has worked as a legal advisor to many major Gambian companies and organisations, including Gamtel, Continent Bank (which dissolved in 2003), Gambia Public Transport Corporation, and the Social Security and Housing Finance Corporation. He also continued to provide advice and representation on a pro bono basis. He served the Gambia Bar Association for several years as its vice president and was also a member of the National Advisory Committee on the selection of judges to the International Court of Justice. ==Political career== === Major opposition politician === 1994 in the Gambia saw a military coup, propelling Yahya Jammeh into the role of head of state. In August 1996, Darboe founded the United Democratic Party based on \\"democracy, constitutionalism and the rule of law\\", and became its first leader. He first ran for president in the 1996 presidential election, where he came second to Jammeh, winning 35.84% of the vote to Jammeh's 55.77%. However, the election was widely criticised by observers for its flaws.Elections in The Gambia, African Elections Database. In June 2000, while on the campaign trail for the 2001 election, his convoy was ambushed by supporters of the Jammeh regime. One attacker, Alieu Njie, was killed in the process. Darboe and 20 others were arrested and held in Basse police station before being transferred to the high court in Banjul and being granted bail. He ran again in the 2001 election, representing a three-way coalition of the UDP, the People's Progressive Party (PPP), and the Gambian People's Party (GPP). He again finished second behind Jammeh, winning 32.59% of the vote. In 2005, the UDP joined with four other opposition parties to form the National Alliance for Democracy and Development (NADD), in preparation for elections in late 2006 and early 2007. The alliance, however, disintegrated after the UDP and the National Reconciliation Party (NRP) withdrew in early 2006. Commonwealth foreign ministers in 2018. By the time the presidential election was held in September 2006, Darboe's UDP had formed another coalition with the NRP and the Gambia Party for Democracy and Progress (GPDP) called the 'Alliance for Regime Change'. In the election, Darboe's running mate was Hamat Bah. A United States diplomatic cable describing the election candidates called Darboe the \\"perennial candidate\\". It speculated by his opponent that Darboe seemed \\"to be relying on tribal loyalties to secure victory at the polls\\", and also noted that \\"it is not clear whether he would be a reliable ally for the U.S.\\". Jammeh won the election with 67.33% of the vote followed by Darboe, who won 26.69%. A third candidate representing the remaining NADD parties, Halifa Sallah, finished a distant third with 5.98% of the vote. Darboe rejected the official results of the election, saying that the election was not free and fair and that there was widespread voter intimidation. Darboe was arrested in April 2016 for participating in protests demanding the body (dead or alive) of his party's Youth Leader, Ebrima Solo Sandeng, who was arrested by the state security agents, tortured and eventually died in custody, a day after his arrest. Darboe remained in jail, during the period leading up the December 2016 presidential election, and in his absence, Adama Barrow, a businessman without political experience, was designated as the party's presidential candidate( with Darboe's endorsement). In a shock result, Barrow, as the joint opposition candidate leading Coalition 2016, defeated Jammeh in the election. A few days after the election, Darboe was among 19 members of the opposition released from prison.Ismail Akwei, \\"Gambia's main opposition party leader, 18 others freed from jail\\", Africanews, 5 December 2016. === Minister of Foreign Affairs === On 1 February 2017, Darboe was sworn in as Barrow's Minister of Foreign Affairs. The next day, he met with foreign diplomats accredited to the Gambia in order to \\"strengthen bilateral relations between the Gambia and the world\\". The same week as his swearing-in, it was confirmed that €33 million in foreign aid from the European Union that had been frozen under Jammeh's regime would be released to the Gambia. In late 2017, Darboe courted controversy when he demanded that the president of Togo, Faure Gnassingbé, resign due to massive anti-government protests. He withdrew the statement a few days later. === Vice President === In a cabinet reshuffle in June 2018, Darboe was promoted to the position of Vice President and Minister of Presidential Affairs, replacing Fatoumata Tambajang, who had held the position since November 2017. Darboe's tenure as Vice President was fraught with reports of constant disagreement with President Adama Barrow. This would ultimately lead to his removal as Vice President in a cabinet reshuffle of 15 March 2019, which also saw the removal of Amadou Sanneh and Lamin N. Dibba, both ministers belonging to the UDP. == Personal life == Darboe is married with two wives and several children. His eldest daughter, Mariama, is a graduate of Tulane University in the United States. He is a sports enthusiast and served as vice president of the Gambian National Olympic and Sports Committee for several years, as well as chairman of the Gambia Wrestling Federation. ==See also== *List of foreign ministers in 2017 *List of current foreign ministers ==References== ==External links== Category:1948 births Category:Living people Category:Vice-Presidents of the Gambia Category:Gambian democracy activists Category:Gambian lawyers Category:2016–2017 Gambian constitutional crisis Category:United Democratic Party (Gambia) politicians Category:Gambian prisoners and detainees Category:University of Lagos alumni Category:University of Ottawa alumni Category:Government ministers of the Gambia Category:Leaders of political parties in the Gambia Category:Foreign ministers of the Gambia Category:Mandinka ","title":"Ousainou Darboe"},{"id":"3238421","text":"200px Maksym Tadeyovych Rylsky (; ; in Kyiv - 24 July 1964 id.) was a Ukrainian poet, translator, academician, Doctor of Philological Sciences. ==Biography== Rylsky was born in Kyiv in 1895 in a family of public activist, ethnographer, publicist, member of the \\"Kiev Stara Hromada\\" (Old Community), Tadei Rozeslavovych Rylsky. His early education, young Rylsky received at home. In 1908 he entered the 3rd grade of the Kyiv Private Gymnasium of Volodymyr Naumenko. During his gymnasium period Rylsky befriended with families of Mykola Lysenko and Oleksandr Rusov. In 1915-17 he studied at medical faculty of Kyiv University, with creation of Ukrainian People's University in October 1917, Rylsky transferred to its history and philology faculty. Due to the Ukrainian–Soviet War, Rylsky left Kyiv in late 1917 and with his brother Ivan worked at food administration in the city of Skvyra, later worked as a rural teacher in villages nearby. In 1918 Bolshevik sympathizers in Romanivka drove Rylsky from his family house, robbed it, destroyed invaluable archive and library of his father. Rylsky returned to Kyiv only in 1923 where at first he was earning money as a teacher. ==Works== He began writing poems early. His first poem was published in 1907 in a newspaper \\"Rada\\", his first collection \\"At white isles\\" () saw the world in 1910. Already in 1918 his poems \\"Tsarevna\\", \\"On the edge of the forest\\", collection \\"Beneath autumn stars\\" showed that period of internship and \\"voice sampling\\" has passed, and his 1922 collection \\"Blue distance\\" confirmed it for sure. The 1920s were marked by the poet's creative flourishing: his collections \\"Through storm and snow\\" (1925), \\"The 13th spring\\" (1926), \\"Where roads meet\\", \\"Hum and rumbling\\" (both 1929). In the last of those collections Rylsky arose also as a gifted translator of world poetry i.e. works of Paul Verlaine, Valery Bryusov, Stéphane Mallarmé, Maurice Maeterlinck, and others. The event of cultural and artistic life became a translation of \\"Pan Tadeusz\\" of Adam Mickiewicz. As a representative of the \\"pure art\\" doctrine, during the years when the Stalinists adopted the official doctrine of \\"socialist realism\\". In 1937 he was involved in rewriting the libretto of Mykola Lysenko's opera Taras Bulba, returning later to neo-classical forms. Maksym Rylsky is one of the most outstanding Ukrainian poets of the 20th century and master of the genres of the modern sonnet and the long narrative poem. He was closely associated with the Neoclassicist group of Ukrainian poets, who employed traditional poetic forms with rhyme and meter, wrote in a clear and accessible contemporary idiom, and often referenced Ancient Greek and Roman mythology as well as numerous other authors from world literature in their poetry. During the wartime period he wrote two masterful long poems that deviated from socialist realism—\\"Thirst\\" (1942) and \\"Journey to Youth\\" (1941-4), for which he was again publicly chastised. In 1942 he became Director of the Institute of Fine Arts, Folklore and Ethnography in Kyiv, a post that he held until his death in 1964. The Institute now bears his name. He published some 30 collections of original poetry during his lifetime as well as numerous translations and scholarly works. By 1974 almost five million copies of his works in the original or in translation had appeared in the USSR. Rylsky joined Communist party in 1943 and was a member of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR in 1946. ==Awards== ===Prizes=== * Lenin Prize, 1960 – for his collections of poems \\"Daleki neboskhyly\\" (1959) and \\"Troyandy j vynohrad\\" (1957) * Stalin Prize, 1943 – for his collections of poems \\"Slovo pro ridnu matir\\", \\"Svitova zorya\\", \\"Svitla zbroya\\", \\"Mandrivka v molodist\\" * Stalin Prize, 1950 – translation into Ukrainian a poem \\"Pan Tadeusz\\" by Adam Mickiewicz ==See also== * Rylsky Institute of Art Studies, Folklore and Ethnology ==References== ==External links== *Rylsky's works in Ukrainian *Koshelivets, I.

It was founded in 1736. About one third of Scotland's lodges were represented at the foundation meeting of the Grand Lodge. ==History== The oldest records held by the Grand Lodge of Scotland are minutes of Lodge Aitcheson's Haven which commence on 9 January 1599. The connection between the craft of stonemasonry and modern Freemasonry can be readily established in Scotland. Dr David Stevenson, Review of The Origins of Freemasonry Facts and Fictions, (review no. 517) accessed 6 December 2013 Scottish Freemasonry has developed a distinct and unique character, even by comparison with the other British Grand Lodges. The Grand Master of the constitution bears the unique title Grand Master Mason, an office which has been held by many distinguished members of Scottish society. Unlike other Regular Masonic jurisdictions all members, of whatever rank, are addressed simply as \\"Brother\\". The usual and more complex masonic titles are used in Scotland, but attach to the office, not the individual. Lodges under the Scottish Constitution are sovereign bodies in their own right, with a considerable degree of control of their own affairs. Many Lodges pre-existed Grand Lodge, all zealously guarding their traditions, and were permitted to retain their own procedures, regalia, and distinctive rituals. Having accepted the principle of independence of old Lodges, it was impossible to deny Lodges founded after 1736 the same level of independence. Of course the rituals must contain the principal points of each degree, but the scope for elaboration is considerable, with numerous interesting additions. Since Scottish Lodges have the right to choose the colours of the Lodge regalia, meetings are very colourful – especially if visitors from other Lodges are present. ==Structure== The Grand Lodge of Scotland has 32 Provincial Grand Lodges in Scotland itself, and 26 District Grand Lodges overseas, each headed by a Provincial Grand Master or District Grand Master. Private lodges belong to a Province or District, through which they report to the Grand Lodge in Edinburgh. == Current Grand Office Bearers == The current Grand Master Mason is Brother William Ramsay McGhee, a former Police Chief Superintendent, who was first installed in November 2018.https://www.grandlodgescotland.com/structure/grand-office- bearers/https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/news/black-isle-former-police- officer-is-new-top-mason-175564/ The Grand Secretary is Brother J.

Euan Edment that the Grand Lodge of Scotland was considering allowing women members, as long as they had joined as men. It was reported that a Senior Judge who is a Freemason was looking into the issue and a statement would be issued when their internal procedures were complete. https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/freemasons-could-break-male- rule-13033623 == Controversies == Joe Morrow who was Grand Master Mason from 2004 - 2005 announced in September 2005 he would be stepping down from the post after a change in personal circumstances. This followed reports in a Sunday newspaper which reported that he was openly gay and planning to change much of the mystique surrounding the organisation. Martin McGibbon, the then Grand Secretary when asked to comment on reports of Mr Morrow’s sexuality, declined to comment.https://www.scotsman.com/news-2-15012/priest-to-quit-as- freemasons-leader-1-1095794 In September 2019 it was announced that the Grand Lodge of Scotland would be closing down its social media accounts due to members posting secrets online and online spats between brethren. https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/grand-lodge-logs-off-social-media-after- freemasons-overshare-secrets-9hv3ctk3j ==International cooperation== The Grand Lodge of Scotland, together with the United Grand Lodge of England and the Grand Lodge of Ireland, is one of the three senior Regular Masonic jurisdictions, commonly known as the Home Grand Lodges. The three operate closely together, through a formal memorandum of cooperation and common rules for recognition of Masonic bodies internationally. Inter-visitation rights with the Home Grand Lodges are generally considered the chief mark of masonic regularity. In many parts of the world local lodges operate under all three of the Home constitutions (Scottish, English, and Irish). By Masonic convention, no Lodges are ever founded in an overseas jurisdiction once it possesses its own Grand Lodge, although lodges which pre-date the local Grand Lodge may continue to operate under their original constitution. In 1953 the Grand Lodge of Scotland chartered the Grand Lodge of the State of Israel as a sovereign Grand Lodge. ==See also== King George VI and Scottish Freemasons * List of Grand Master Masons of the Grand Lodge of Scotland ==References== ==External links== * The Grand Lodge of Antient, Free and Accepted Masons of Scotland * Famous Scottish Freemasons * The Mother Lodge of Scotland, Lodge Mother Kilwinning No.0 * Pictures From The Grand Lodge Of Scotland Building.

Originally an employee with the Cadbury confectionery firm in Birmingham, he was first engaged by Warwickshire as a professional in 1904 but played only irregularly for over half a decade owing to the presence of Lilley behind the stumps. When, after losing his Test place Lilley decided to concentrate on batting, Tiger Smith took his opportunity remarkably well, and developed a remarkable understanding with Frank Foster in his first full season in 1910. The following year Warwickshire achieved an astonishing triumph in the County Championship even though the abnormally dry and hot weather made it an utter fluke based around the pace bowling of Foster and Frank Field. Smith kept wicket superbly – standing up to Foster even though he could get great pace off the extremely fast pitches – and made a remarkable advance in batting. He had not scored one half century before 1911 but advanced to over 800 runs with a century against Surrey at Edgbaston. His choice for the 1911/1912 Ashes tour was surprising but Smith's skill at taking Foster was sufficient to keep Herbert Strudwick out of the Test line-up. He made eight catches and one remarkable stumping off Foster and took the rising, spinning bowling of Sydney Barnes better than any other 'keeper before or since. 1912 saw the ill-fated Triangular Tournament, but the summer was so wet that English cricket in 1911 and 1912 was quite literally two different ball games. Warwickshire unsurprisingly declined to mid-table, but Smith maintained his form so well in 1913 with a personal high 68 dismissals that he was chosen for the South African tour. However, he lost his place to Strudwick after one Test and never regained his England place as Strudwick and Arthur Dolphin overtook him. However, in the postwar years Smith was a mainstay of Warwickshire cricket right up to his retirement at the end of 1930. During this period, he not only kept wicket consistently, but also advanced so much as a batsman that he scored 1,303 runs in 1922 and 1,477 at over 31 an innings in 1925. In that season, he played a brilliant unbeaten innings of 139 out of 392 for one against Sussex and was unlucky that Jack Hobbs' presentation may have denied him a chance for Cricketer of the Year nomination by Wisden. After retiring as a player, Tiger Smith umpired first-class cricket from May 1931 up to the outbreak of World War II. He stood as an umpire in eight Test matches in England, starting with 2nd Test between England and West Indies at Old Trafford in July 1933, then the 2nd Test between England and South Africa at Lord's in June 1935, the 2nd and 3rd Tests between England and New Zealand in 1937, the 2nd Test and 4th Tests between England and Australia Headingley in 1938, and finally the 1st and 2nd Test between England and West Indies in 1939. He became coach of Warwickshire after the war, a position which he held until the end of 1955 and which saw the county win its second County Championship in 1951. He also umpired a few further first-class matches until 1953, mostly involving Warwickshire against non-county sides, such as Cambridge University or Combined Services. However, he continued to supervise the local indoor cricket school right up until the early 1970s when he handed the reins over to younger personnel. He was always renowned for his fighting qualities both on and off the cricket field and for his razor-sharp sense of humour which made him popular throughout his association with the game of cricket. At the time of his death, Tiger Smith was the oldest living Test cricketer and was the last surviving pre-First World War player. ==External links== * * Test batting and wicket-keeping * First-class batting and wicket- keeping * As a first-class umpire Category:1886 births Category:1979 deaths Category:English cricketers Category:England Test cricketers Category:Warwickshire cricketers Category:English Test cricket umpires Category:Marylebone Cricket Club cricketers Category:North v South cricketers Category:Players cricketers Category:Warwickshire cricket coaches Category:English cricketers of 1919 to 1945 ","title":"Tiger Smith"},{"id":"3238440","text":"Mia M.

The company specialises in measurement, motion control, healthcare, spectroscopy and manufacturing and is best known for its coordinate-measuring machines and machine tool products. It is a leading company in metal additive manufacturing where machines print parts from metal powder. It is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index. ==History== The Company was founded by Sir David McMurtry and John Deer in 1973. McMurtry had needed to measure fuel pipes on a prototype jet engine: at the time, coordinate-measuring machine sensors featured rigid styli, which required manual positioning on the surface and which yielded poor repeatability when measuring delicate components. To meet this need, McMurtry invented a touch-trigger probe device, which he then patented. The probe featured an elegant 'kinematic' location for a spring-loaded stylus, providing a highly repeatable seated position for the stylus combined with the compliance needed to measure such components.

The IETF defines ASON as an alternative/supplement to NMS based connection management.Automatically Switched Optical Networks (ASON) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS,\\" Route into Common Future\\" - Slide 6 == The need for ASON == In an optical network without ASON, whenever a user requires more bandwidth, there is a request for a new connection from the user to the service provider. The service provider must then manually plan and configure the route in the network. This is not only time consuming, but also wastes bandwidth if the user sparingly uses the connection. Bandwidth is increasingly becoming a precious resource and expectations from future optical networks are that they should be able to efficiently handle resources as quickly as possible. ASON fulfills some of the requirements of optical networks such as: * Fast and automatic end-to-end provisioning * Fast and efficient re-routing * Support of different clients, but optimized for IP * Dynamic set up of connections * Support of optical virtual private networks (OVPNs) * Support of different levels of quality of service (These requirements are not restricted to optical networks and can be applied to any transport network, including SDH Networks.)Automatic Switched Optical Networks: functionality and architectural components, Roberto Clemente and Giuseppe Ferraris , 2nd Eurescom WDM Hungarian Workshop Budapest, March 27th 2001 == Logical architecture of an ASON == Logical Architecture of ASON The logical architecture of an ASON can be divided into three planes: * Transport plane * Control plane * Management plane The Transport Plane contains a number of switches (optical or otherwise) responsible for transporting user data via connections. These switches are connected to each other via PI (Physical Interface). The Control Plane is responsible for the actual resource and connection management within an ASN network. It consists of a series of OCC (Optical Connection Controllers), interconnected via NNIs (Network to Network Interfaces). These OCCs have the following functions: * Network topology discovery (resource discovery) * Signaling, routing, address assignment * Connection set-up/tear-down * Connection protection/restoration * Traffic engineering * Wavelength assignment The Management Plane is responsible for managing the Control plane. Its responsibilities include Configuration Management of the Control Plane Resources, Routing Areas, Transport resource in Control Plane and Policy. It also provides Fault Management, Performance Management, Accounting and Security Management functions.Management of ASON-capable Network and its Control Plane, by H. Kam LAM, ITU-T Workshop “NGN and its Transport Networks“ Kobe, 20–21 April 2006 The Management Plane contains the Network Management Entity which is connected to an OCC in Control Plane via the NMI-A ( Network Management Interface for ASON Control Plane) and to one of the switches via NMI-T ( Network Management Interface for the Transport Network). The traffic from user connected to an ASON network contains data for both Transport and Control Plane. The user is connected to Transport plane via a PI (Physical Interface), while it communicates with the Control plane via a UNI ( User Network Interface). == The Role of IETF == While ITU has worked on the requirements and architecture of ASON based on the requirements on its members, it is explicitly aiming to avoid the development of new protocols, when existing ones will work fine. The IETF, on the other hand, has been tasked with the development of new protocols in response to general industry requirement. Therefore, while ITU already include the PNNI protocol for signaling in the Control plane, IETF has been developing GMPLS (Generalized MPLS) as a second option protocol to be used in the Control Plane for signalling.ASON AND GMPLS - THE BATTLE OF..............

Historically, the earliest microfabrication processes were used for integrated circuit fabrication, also known as \\"semiconductor manufacturing\\" or \\"semiconductor device fabrication\\". In the last two decades microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), microsystems (European usage), micromachines (Japanese terminology) and their subfields, microfluidics/lab-on-a-chip, optical MEMS (also called MOEMS), RF MEMS, PowerMEMS, BioMEMS and their extension into nanoscale (for example NEMS, for nano electro mechanical systems) have re-used, adapted or extended microfabrication methods. Flat-panel displays and solar cells are also using similar techniques. Miniaturization of various devices presents challenges in many areas of science and engineering: physics, chemistry, materials science, computer science, ultra-precision engineering, fabrication processes, and equipment design. It is also giving rise to various kinds of interdisciplinary research.Nitaigour Premchand Mahalik (2006) \\"Micromanufacturing and Nanotechnology\\", Springer, The major concepts and principles of microfabrication are microlithography, doping, thin films, etching, bonding, and polishing. Simplified illustration of the process of fabrication of a CMOS inverter on p-type substrate in semiconductor microfabrication. Each etch step is detailed in the following image. Note: Gate, source and drain contacts are not normally in the same plane in real devices, and the diagrams are not to scale. Detail of an etch step. ==Fields of use== Microfabricated devices include: * integrated circuits (“microchips”) (see semiconductor manufacturing) * microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) and microoptoelectromechanical systems (MOEMS) * microfluidic devices (ink jet print heads) * solar cells * flat panel displays (see AMLCD and thin-film transistors) * sensors (microsensors) (biosensors, nanosensors) * power MEMS, fuel cells, energy harvesters/scavengers ==Origins== Microfabrication technologies originate from the microelectronics industry, and the devices are usually made on silicon wafers even though glass, plastics and many other substrate are in use. Micromachining, semiconductor processing, microelectronic fabrication, semiconductor fabrication, MEMS fabrication and integrated circuit technology are terms used instead of microfabrication, but microfabrication is the broad general term. Traditional machining techniques such as electro-discharge machining, spark erosion machining, and laser drilling have been scaled from the millimeter size range to micrometer range, but they do not share the main idea of microelectronics-originated microfabrication: replication and parallel fabrication of hundreds or millions of identical structures. This parallelism is present in various imprint, casting and moulding techniques which have successfully been applied in the microregime. For example, injection moulding of DVDs involves fabrication of submicrometer-sized spots on the disc. == Processes== Microfabrication is actually a collection of technologies which are utilized in making microdevices. Some of them have very old origins, not connected to manufacturing, like lithography or etching. Polishing was borrowed from optics manufacturing, and many of the vacuum techniques come from 19th century physics research. Electroplating is also a 19th-century technique adapted to produce micrometre scale structures, as are various stamping and embossing techniques. To fabricate a microdevice, many processes must be performed, one after the other, many times repeatedly. These processes typically include depositing a film, patterning the film with the desired micro features, and removing (or etching) portions of the film. Thin film metrology is used typically during each of these individual process steps, to ensure the film structure has the desired characteristics in terms of thickness (t), refractive index (n) and extinction coefficient (k), for suitable device behavior. For example, in memory chip fabrication there are some 30 lithography steps, 10 oxidation steps, 20 etching steps, 10 doping steps, and many others are performed. The complexity of microfabrication processes can be described by their mask count. This is the number of different pattern layers that constitute the final device. Modern microprocessors are made with 30 masks while a few masks suffice for a microfluidic device or a laser diode. Microfabrication resembles multiple exposure photography, with many patterns aligned to each other to create the final structure. ===Substrates=== Microfabricated devices are not generally freestanding devices but are usually formed over or in a thicker support substrate. For electronic applications, semiconducting substrates such as silicon wafers can be used. For optical devices or flat panel displays, transparent substrates such as glass or quartz are common. The substrate enables easy handling of the micro device through the many fabrication steps. Often many individual devices are made together on one substrate and then singulated into separated devices toward the end of fabrication. === Deposition or growth === Microfabricated devices are typically constructed using one or more thin films (see Thin film deposition). The purpose of these thin films depends on the type of device. Electronic devices may have thin films which are conductors (metals), insulators (dielectrics) or semiconductors. Optical devices may have films which are reflective, transparent, light guiding or scattering. Films may also have a chemical or mechanical purpose as well as for MEMS applications. Examples of deposition techniques include: *Thermal oxidation *Local oxidation of silicon *Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) **APCVD **LPCVD **PECVD *Physical vapor deposition (PVD) **Sputtering **Evaporative deposition **Electron beam PVD *Epitaxy ===Patterning=== It is often desirable to pattern a film into distinct features or to form openings (or vias) in some of the layers. These features are on the micrometer or nanometer scale and the patterning technology is what defines microfabrication. The patterning technique typically uses a 'mask' to define portions of the film which will be removed. Examples of patterning techniques include: *Photolithography *Shadow masking ===Etching=== Etching is the removal of some portion of the thin film or substrate. The substrate is exposed to an etching (such as an acid or plasma) which chemically or physically attacks the film until it is removed. Etching techniques include: *Dry etching (plasma etching) such as reactive-ion etching (RIE) or deep reactive-ion etching (DRIE) *Wet etching or chemical etching ===Microforming=== Microforming is a microfabrication process of microsystem or microelectromechanical system (MEMS) \\"parts or structures with at least two dimensions in the submillimeter range.\\" It includes techniques such as microextrusion, microstamping, and microcutting. These and other microforming processes have been envisioned and researched since at least 1990, leading to the development of industrial- and experimental-grade manufacturing tools. However, as Fu and Chan pointed out in a 2013 state-of-the-art technology review, several issues must still be resolved before the technology can be implemented more widely, including deformation load and defects, forming system stability, mechanical properties, and other size-related effects on the crystallite (grain) structure and boundaries: > In microforming, the ratio of the total surface area of grain boundaries to > the material volume decreases with the decrease of specimen size and the > increase of grain size. This leads to the decrease of grain boundary > strengthening effect. Surface grains have lesser constraints compared to > internal grains. The change of flow stress with part geometry size is partly > attributed to the change of volume fraction of surface grains. In addition, > the anisotropic properties of each grain become significant with the > decrease of workpiece size, which results in the inhomogeneous deformation, > irregular formed geometry and the variation of deformation load. There is a > critical need to establish the systematic knowledge of microforming to > support the design of part, process, and tooling with the consideration of > size effects. ===Other=== a wide variety of other processes for cleaning, planarizing, or modifying the chemical properties of microfabricated devices can also be performed. Some examples include: *Doping by either thermal diffusion or ion implantation *Chemical-mechanical planarization (CMP) *Wafer cleaning, also known as \\"surface preparation\\" (see below) *Wire bonding ==Cleanliness in wafer fabrication== Microfabrication is carried out in cleanrooms, where air has been filtered of particle contamination and temperature, humidity, vibrations and electrical disturbances are under stringent control. Smoke, dust, bacteria and cells are micrometers in size, and their presence will destroy the functionality of a microfabricated device. Cleanrooms provide passive cleanliness but the wafers are also actively cleaned before every critical step. RCA-1 clean in ammonia-peroxide solution removes organic contamination and particles; RCA-2 cleaning in hydrogen chloride-peroxide mixture removes metallic impurities. Sulfuric acid-peroxide mixture (a.k.a. Piranha) removes organics. Hydrogen fluoride removes native oxide from silicon surface. These are all wet cleaning steps in solutions. Dry cleaning methods include oxygen and argon plasma treatments to remove unwanted surface layers, or hydrogen bake at elevated temperature to remove native oxide before epitaxy. Pre-gate cleaning is the most critical cleaning step in CMOS fabrication: it ensures that the ca. 2 nm thick oxide of a MOS transistor can be grown in an orderly fashion. Oxidation, and all high temperature steps are very sensitive to contamination, and cleaning steps must precede high temperature steps. Surface preparation is just a different viewpoint, all the steps are the same as described above: it is about leaving the wafer surface in a controlled and well known state before you start processing. Wafers are contaminated by previous process steps (e.g. metals bombarded from chamber walls by energetic ions during ion implantation), or they may have gathered polymers from wafer boxes, and this might be different depending on wait time. Wafer cleaning and surface preparation work similarly to the machines in a bowling alley: first they remove all unwanted bits and pieces, and then they reconstruct the desired pattern so that the game can go on. ==See also== *3D microfabrication *Semiconductor fabrication ==References== ==Further reading== *Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems (J.MEMS) *Sensors and Actuators A: Physical *Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical *Journal of Micromechanics and Microengineering *Lab on a Chip *IEEE Transactions of Electron Devices, *Journal of Vacuum Science and Technology A: Vacuum, Surfaces, Films *Journal of Vacuum Science and Technology B: Microelectronics and Nanometer Structures: Processing, Measurement, and Phenomena ===Books about microfabrication=== *Introduction to Microfabrication (2004) by S.

Whilst a Member of Parliament, he served as Joint Under Secretary of State for Scotland from 1966 to 1970, and as Minister of State for Agriculture from 1974 to 1979. He later became Shadow Minister for the Arts in opposition. Buchan opposed an early day motion to block the televised version of Tony Harrison's poem \\"V\\" on Channel 4, saying that members who opposed the broadcast had either not read or understood the poem. Buchan was also influential in changing the voting system for the referendum on Scottish Home Rule in the late-1970s. He abstained during Labour's 1981 deputy leadership election, commenting: \\"My brain turned against Benn, but my stomach turned against Healey.\\" He died in 1990 (coincidentally, the neighbouring MP for Paisley North, Allen Adams also died that year, resulting in by-elections being held in the same month for the two seats). He was succeeded as MP for Paisley South by Gordon McMaster of the Labour Party. ==Family== He was married for 44 years (1946–1990) to Janey Buchan (née Kent), Labour Member of the European Parliament for Glasgow from 1979 to 1994. She died in Brighton on 14 January 2012.

It was first published in 1735 and composed in 1734, when Pope learned that Arbuthnot was dying. Pope described it as a memorial of their friendship.Pat Rogers, The Alexander Pope Encyclopedia (Greenwood Press, 2004), p. 110. It has been calledRogers, The Alexander Pope Encyclopedia, p. 110. Pope's \\"most directly autobiographical work\\", in which he defends his practice in the genre of satire and attacks those who had been his opponents and rivals throughout his career.Rogers, The Alexander Pope Encyclopedia, p. 110. Both in composition and in publication, the poem had a checkered history. In its canonical form, it is composed of 419 lines of heroic couplets.Rogers, The Alexander Pope Encyclopedia, p. 110. The Epistle to Dr. Arbuthnot is notable as the source of the phrase \\"damn with faint praise,\\" used so often it has become a cliché or idiom. Another of its notable lines is \\"Who breaks a butterfly upon a wheel?\\" ==Addressee== Portrait of John Arbuthnot (1723) by Godfrey Kneller John Arbuthnot was a physician known as a man of wit. He was a member of the Martinus Scriblerus Club, along with Pope, Jonathan Swift and John Gay. He was formerly the physician of Queen Anne.The Norton Anthology of English Literature, volume 1. On 17 July 1734 Arbuthnot wrote to Pope to tell him that he had a terminal illness. In a response dated 2 August, Pope indicates that he planned to write more satire, and on 25 August told Arbuthnot that he was going to address one of his epistles to him, later characterizing it as a memorial to their friendship. Arbuthnot died on 27 February 1735, eight weeks after the poem was published.Rogers, The Alexander Pope Encyclopedia, p. 110; Baines, The Complete Critical Guide to Alexander Pope (Routledge, 2000), p. 37. ==Composition== Portrait of Alexander Pope (ca. 1727) by Michael Dahl According to Pope, the Epistle to Dr. Arbuthnot was a satire \\"written piecemeal many years, and which I have now made haste to put together\\". The poem was completed by 3 September, when Pope wrote to Arbuthnot describing the poem as \\"the best Memorial that I can leave, both of my Friendship to you, & of my own Character being such as you need not be ashamd of that Friendship\\".Rogers, The Pope Encyclopedia, p. 110, citing Pope's Correspondence 3: 416–17, 423, 428, 431. ==Publishing history== Epistle to Dr. Arbuthnot has a \\"tangled\\" publishing history. The poem was first published as a folio of 24 pages on 2 January 1735 under the title An Epistle from Mr. Pope to Dr. Arbuthnot, with a date of 1734. It appeared in Pope's Works the same year in folio, quarto and octavo, with a Dublin edition and an Edinburgh piracy. During Pope's lifetime, it was included among the Moral Essays. In 1751, after the death of Pope, it was published at the beginning of Imitations of Horace and retitled Epistle to Dr. Arbuthnot, being the Prologue to the Satire, even though it lacks both Horatian and prologic characteristics.Rogers, The Pope Encyclopedia, p. 110. ==Analysis== The poem includes character sketches of \\"Atticus\\" (Joseph Addison) and \\"Sporus\\" (John Hervey). Addison is presented as having great talent that is diminished by fear and jealousy; Hervey is sexually perverse, malicious, and both absurd and dangerous.Rogers, The Alexander Pope Encyclopedia, p. 111. Pope marks the virulence of the \\"Sporus\\" attack by having Arbuthnot exclaim \\"Who breaks a butterfly upon a wheel?\\" in reference to the form of torture called the breaking wheel.Dennis Todd, Imagining Monsters: Miscreations of Self in Eighteenth-Century England (University of Chicago Press, 1995), p. 245. By emphasizing friendship, Pope counters his image as \\"an envious and malicious monster\\" whose \\"satire springs from a being devoid of all natural affections and lacking a heart.\\"Todd, Imagining Monsters, p. 247. It was an \\"efficient and authoritative revenge\\":Baines, The Complete Critical Guide to Alexander Pope, p. 36. in this poem and others of the 1730s, Pope presents himself as writing satire not out of ego or misanthropy, but to serve impersonal virtue.Todd, Imagining Monsters, p. 247. Although rejected by a critic contemporary with Pope as a \\"mere lampoon\\",John Barnard, Alexander Pope: The Critical Heritage (Routledge, 1973), p. 16. Epistle to Dr. Arbuthnot has been described as one of Pope's \\"most striking achievements, a work of authentic power, both tragic and comic, as well as great formal ingenuity, despite the near-chaos from which it emerged.\\"Rogers, The Alexander Pope Encyclopedia, p. 111. ==References== ==External links== * An Epistle to Dr. Arbuthnot at the Eighteenth-Century Poetry Archive (ECPA) * Annotated text of the poem Category:Works by Alexander Pope Category:1734 poems Category:British satirical poems ","title":"Epistle to Dr Arbuthnot"},{"id":"3238548","text":"Berry (Geoffrey) Lionel Berry, 2nd Viscount Kemsley (29 June 1909 – 28 February 1999), was a British Conservative politician, peer and newspaper editor. ==Biography== Berry was born in Hendon.Births England and Wales 1837-1915 His father was Gomer Berry, 1st Viscount Kemsley (1883–1968), a prominent newspaper baron, owner of titles including The Sunday Times and the Daily Record.

Ketchikan Daily News, 25 February 2017 ==Route== The Chenega ran into controversy from virtually the day it came into service. The Chenega had long been promised to service Prince William Sound year-round, and starting in the summer of 2005, however it came into service later than scheduled and the state of Alaska soon reneged on its promise for full-time Prince William Sound service and transferred the Chenega to its current route between Ketchikan and Petersburg with occasional stops in Wrangell for the winter. The new plan is to have the Chenega run this Southeast Alaska route in the winter and then transfer the ferry up to Prince William Sound in the summer. This is especially controversial because unlike feeder and mainline ferry vessels, the fast ferries only operate in the day thus their crews live in their homeports offering additional economic stimulus to its host community. Because of this, Cordova, the Chenega's Prince William Sound home, was especially outraged after the decision to transfer the boat to Ketchikan.

In contrast to a formal synagogue, a shtiebel is far smaller and approached more casually. It is typically as small as a room in a private home or a place of business which is set aside for the express purpose of prayer, or it may be as large as a small-sized synagogue. It may or may not offer the communal services of a synagogue. Traditional shtiebels are not only a place for prayer, but also a place for community gathering. Due to the prominence of a Hasidic rebbe, the shtiebel served as a medium for being near to him. A shtiebel would be host to the Seudah Shlishit, the ritual third meal of the Sabbath. The shtiebel attracted newcomers through the inviting atmosphere it created by allowing prayer, eating, drinking, and community activities. Shtiebels were common in Jewish communities in Eastern Europe before the Holocaust. The shtiebel was distinctly characteristic of Hasidic Judaism and played a central and critical role in the life of the Hasidim. It continues to exist in contemporary Israel and the United States. The shtiebel was cost effective and assisted in the spread of Hasidism through a grassroots movement where individuals previously exposed to Hasidism could establish one in their local community. This characteristic of the shtiebel allowed for Hasidism to reach more communities on the local and regional level throughout the 18th and 19th Century. In Israel, minyans are held in storefront shtiebelekh in major business areas around the clock; whenever ten men show up, a new minyan begins. The Zichron Moshe shtiebel in the Zikhron Moshe neighborhood of Jerusalem (near Geula) is located in a proper synagogue, with many rooms for round-the-clock minyans. This shtiebel is well known as the locale of Friday-night mussar talks which Rabbi Sholom Schwadron, the \\"Maggid of Jerusalem,\\" delivered for more than 40 years. == Shtiblach in its current meaning == In the ultra-Orthodox community in Israel, synagogues developed in which a number of rooms were concentrated (hence Shtieblach - plural in Yiddish for shtibel) to prayer minyanim. The purpose of the shtiblach is to allow a parallel prayer place and a more liberated atmosphere. Unlike a synagogue in which there are regular prayer times, certain seating arrangements, and the like, the Shtiblach operates at all hours of the day and routinely includes temporary worshipers. ==Famous Shtiblach in Israel== *Itzkovitch – Bnei Brak ==References== Category:Haredi Judaism Category:Synagogues Category:Yiddish words and phrases ","title":"Shtiebel"},{"id":"3238580","text":"Arthur Caldwell may refer to: *Arthur Caldwell (Australian footballer) (1886–1915), Australian rules footballer *Arthur Caldwell (English footballer) (1913–1989), English footballer ==See also== *Arthur Calwell (1896–1973), Australian politician ","title":"Arthur Caldwell"},{"id":"3238584","text":"Floris Maarten Alphons Maria Evers (born 26 February 1983 in Tilburg, Noord- Brabant) is a field hockey player from the Netherlands, who won the silver medal with the Dutch national team at the 2004 Summer OlympicsOlympic results and at the 2012 Summer Olympics.

Briefly known as Sociedad Licenciataria Norte S.A., it quickly changed its name, and is usually known as simply \\"Telecom\\" within Argentina. Together with Telefónica de Argentina in the southern part of the country, was part of the national fixed telephone market duopoly, until 8 October 1999. Telecom also operates the mobile phone service Personal, the cable modem service Arnet- Fibertel and the cable operator Cablevisión. ==History== Telecom building in Puerto Madero, Buenos Aires. In 1990, Argentina started to privatize most of its state-owned utilities: power, water, trains, and telecommunications, just to name a few. The monopoly of state-owned phone service ENTel was split into two territories: France Télécom was given the \\"upper half\\" of the country, from the middle to the north, and Telefónica was given the southern part. Each company was given an initial 7 year monopoly beginning on November 8, 1990. Initially, other companies were given exclusive licenses for international long distance, as well as cellular phone service. France Télécom later sold its part of the company to the Argentine Werthein Group. Its Puerto Madero headquarters were designed by the American architectural studio of Kohn Pedersen Fox, and inaugurated on February 18, 1998.https://www.emporis.com/buildings/119699/torre-telecom-buenos-aires- argentina Both local phone companies turned their systems into profitable operations in just a few years, despite the terrible conditions they inherited from ENTel. In the worst years of ENTel, a line activation would take several years. The telephone wiring layout across the country was undocumented. At privatization in 1990, the wait was still 4 years to get new service and 40 days for repair.https://institucional.telecom.com.ar/inversores/ Starting off Telecom Argentina invested into the country and during the first 8 years of strong investment in infrastructure deployment at a rate a little less than a billion u$s per year, with a complete restructuring of the copper access network and the deployment of one of the most advanced and large deployment of SDH long-distance fiber network at those times 2.5Gbit/s networks, and the upgrade of almost all centrall offices, most of them electromechanical and also some manual small exchanges. Some years later, all of the phone network was upgraded to a state-of-the-art system, from central telephone exchanges up to the wires going into homes; by 2005, 98% of the ENTel network infrastructure had been replaced. In 2005, the Bank of New York was appointed as trustee, registrar and paying and transfer agent for Telecom Argentina's $1.5 billion debt restructuring, the biggest Argentine debt restructuring to date. The restructure involved the exchange of $2.8 billion in outstanding debt for newly issued exchange notes and cash, and involved consent requests and instructions for over 1100 creditors. ==Personal== Logo of Personal, the mobile-phone division of Telecom Argentina. \\"Telecom Personal\\", owned by Telecom Argentina, is one of only 3 mobile phone companies in Argentina. Personal used a similar logo to Telecom itself until November 2011, when they switched into a new handwritten logo combined with nine brand colors.Personal presenta un nuevo logo y desarrollo de identidad de marca - iprofesional.com, November 7, 2011Telecom Personal se renueva con un logotipo personalizado para cada usuario - Pienso Logo Existo, November 14, 2011 Telecom Personal owns 67.5% of Paraguayan mobile provider Núcleo S.A., which started in 1998 and also does business under the brand name Personal.

(CVH) *20.06% VLG S.A.U. *29.65% publicly traded *0.01% Class C shares ==Criticism== Critics of Telecom argue that, when it received government subsidies to provide service in remote areas, it either didn't provide the service, or just installed public telephones. Critics also point to the high prices charged by the company, and to the fact that, unlike much of the world, Argentine customers have to pay per minute, rather than a fixed price. In contrast, defendants of the system point out that the 011 area code (called AMBA, most of Gran Buenos Aires) provides local phone access to five to six million users (15-16% of the total population of the country), making a flat-rate type of service economically impossible. Due to the lack of long requested flat telephone rates for local calls, specially to connect to Internet, a lot of users installed ADSL services from Arnet, Telecom's Internet service provider. The company was heavily criticised when it decided to limit ADSL users to 4 GB per month and charge for extra traffic, a decision which was promptly reversed. Other critics to the company are centred on the lack of information on their offers, and obscure contracts with prices not including taxes, and other important information. ==See also== *Argentine telephone numbering plan *Communications in Argentina ==References== ==External links== *Official website Category:Companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange Category:Telecommunications companies established in 1990 Category:Companies based in Buenos Aires Category:Communications in Paraguay Category:Telecommunications companies of Argentina Category:Buildings and structures in Buenos Aires Category:1990 establishments in Argentina Category:Internet service providers of Argentina Category:Argentine brands ","title":"Telecom Argentina"},{"id":"3238601","text":"Visualisation of a Townsend avalanche, which is sustained by the generation of secondary electrons in an electric field Secondary electrons are electrons generated as ionization products.

The Regiment is located in the city of Port Elizabeth. ==History== ===Origin=== Prince Alfred's Guard was established on 19 September 1856 as the Port Elizabeth Volunteer Rifle Corps. In 1860 the title Prince Alfred's Guard was assumed unofficially (after Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh) and on 11 July 1874 this name was officially sanctioned as Prince Alfred's Volunteer Guard. The name was later changed to Prince Alfred's Guard. ===Xhosa Wars=== The Regiment first saw action on 2 December 1877, against the Gcaleka tribesmen in the Battle of Umzintzani during the Ninth Xhosa War. The next conflict that the PAG participated in was the Basutoland Campaign of 1880 to 1881, during which a 500-metre bayonet charge by the Regiment which led to the capture of the village of Lerotholi, an enemy village.

He was the sixth Governor of Wyoming from April 28, 1903 until January 2, 1905. ==Biography== Chatterton was born in Oswego County, New York, but raised in Washington, D.C.. He attended the George Washington University, then Millersville State Normal School in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. In 1878, he moved to Sheridan, in Wyoming Territory, and set up as a businessman. He received a law degree from the University of Michigan in 1892. Chaterton married Stella Wyland Chatterton. ==Career== In 1888, he began his political career by successfully running for treasurer and probate judge of Carbon County. He served time in two classes of the Wyoming State Legislature from 1890 until 1893. He was the Wyoming Republican state chair from 1893 to 1894. In 1898, he was elected Secretary of State, but his tenure was interrupted by the death of Governor DeForest Richards in 1903, thrusting him into the position of governor. Chatterdon served as governor from April 28, 1903 to January 2, 1905. It was during Chatterton's time as Governor that the hanging of Tom Horn occurred; it has been speculated that Chatterton's failure to win re-election as governor in 1905 was the result of his refusal to commute Horn's death sentence. Chatterdon was not nominated by his party to fill the office of governor for the 1904 election, but continued to serve as Secretary of State until his term expired in 1907. After his term as Secretary of State expired, Chatterton did not serve in public office again. He set up a private law practice, from which he retired in 1932. ==Death and legacy== Chatterton died on May 9, 1958, and is interred at Lakeview Cemetery in Cheyenne, Wyoming. He was an Episcopalian and a member of the Knights Templar Masonic Order. Chatterdon has been credited as the first to announce the Wyoming (song) as the official state song, during the Industrial Convention in 1903. The song was later endorsed as the official song by the state press association, state industrial convention and the state university. ==Referencesfrom the National Governors Association *State biography from the Wyoming State Archives *Biographical summary from the Political Graveyard *North Platte River from Wyoming Tales and Trails * *Roster of State Officers from the Wyoming Secretary of State website * Wyoming Roundup * State of Wyoming Website Category:1860 births Category:1958 deaths Category:People from Oswego County, New York Category:Wyoming state senators Category:Secretaries of State of Wyoming Category:Governors of Wyoming Category:University of Michigan Law School alumni Category:Wyoming Republicans Category:Republican Party state governors of the United States Category:People from Carbon County, Wyoming Category:George Washington University alumni Category:People from Sheridan, Wyoming ","title":"Fenimore Chatterton"},{"id":"3238680","text":"The National Alliance for Democracy and Development (NADD) is a three-party coalition (previously five parties) of Gambian opposition political parties.

Spenborough was created as an urban district in 1915 by the merger of Cleckheaton, Gomersal and Liversedge urban districts. The amalgamation was carried out on the instigation of Cleckheaton Urban District Council, in order to resist plans by the County Borough of Bradford to annex the area. The name \\"Spenborough\\", after the River Spen, was also suggested by Cleckheaton UDC. The district was expanded in 1937 by taking in the abolished Birkenshaw and Hunsworth urban districts, as well as part of the parishes of Clifton and Hartshead from the Halifax Rural District. Attempts to incorporate neighbouring Heckmondwike which is considered to be in the Spen Valley area, were never successful. On 29 July 1955 it was granted a charter of incorporation creating it a municipal borough. In 1974 Spenborough was abolished under the Local Government Act 1972, with its area forming part of the Metropolitan Borough of Kirklees, West Yorkshire. Today, Kirklees Council recognises the former Spenborough borough area, with neighbouring Heckmondwike, as the Spen Valley Locality in its structure. ==Legacy== Spenborough Guardian offices, Cleckheaton Despite the borough's abolition in 1974, the name continues in use in the area.

The Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) alleged that he entered the country as a sleeper agent for al-Qaeda. He had worked in Pakistan from 1990-1994 for a charity that assisted refugees. After immigrating to Canada in 1995, Harkat applied for refugee status and for a Permanent Resident card. He worked as a gas station attendant and a deliveryman for Pizza Pizza during his first seven years in Canada. He was released on May 23, 2006 under house arrest, while fighting deportation. ==Early life and education== Mohamed Harkat was born in Taguine, Algeria to El-Ait, and is one of seven sons. His father was born in Algeria, but worked both there and in France in the construction business. As a student at the University of Oran, Harkat joined the Front Islamique du Salut (FIS) in 1989, when it was still a legitimate political movement. He offered them the use of a family-owned house in Zmalet El Emir Abdelkader as a registered district office. Harkat was excused from Algerian military service because he broke his left leg as a child and it never properly healed.Transcript of proceedings - Federal Court File No. DES-4-02 \\"In the matter of Mohammed Harkat\\", heard at Ottawa, Ontario, October 27, 2004, pp. 179-181. In March 1990, the Algerian government stormed the house and arrested the FIS members within. Harkat was not present, and was warned by his uncle that security forces were seeking him. ==Leaving Algeria== Harkat departed in April 1990 for a trip to Saudi Arabia using a Hajj passport. From there he travelled to Pakistan, where the Muslim World League employed him and sent him to Peshawar in May 1990, to help distribute relief packages and organise aid programs.CSIS interview of Harkat, May 1, 1997 For the next four years, Harkat worked and lived out of a Babbi warehouse. He picked up shipments of food and relief supplies for the refugee camps in the city from the Peshawar airport and train station, earning $300–500 monthly.Transcript of proceedings - Federal Court File No. DES-4-02, In the matter of Mohammed Harkat, heard at Ottawa, Ontario, October 27, 2004, pp. 85, 91-101, 117, 124-125, 128-129. CSIS has alleged that during this time he also worked for Human Concern International. They suggest that this meant he was a formal colleague of Ahmed Khadr, and that he may have run a guest house for foreign mujahideen traveling to participate in the Afghan civil war.Duffy, Andrew.

They allege he eventually aligned with Gama\`at Islamiyya. CSIS will not provide a source for this claim, arguing that the information came from \\"open sources\\". In September 1995, Harkat paid $5000 for airfare to travel from Pakistan to Malaysia, from where he hoped to catch a direct flight to Canada.Immigration Screening interview of Harkat, June 11, 1998, Q&A; 71-72 In Kuala Lampur, he purchased a forged Saudi passport in the name of Mohammed M.

Saudi passports did not require entry visas to visit Canada.Service Immigration Screening interview of Harkat, June 11, 1998 ==In Canada== Holding about $1000, Harkat flew from Malaysia to Toronto via the United Kingdom on October 6, 1995. He contacted Taher, a colleague he had met in 1994 in Peshawar then living in Ottawa, Ontario. He arranged to meet him at the Ottawa bus station, since he said he had been told that it was best to start a refugee claim from the city. Taher met him at the bus terminal and took him to the mosque, where he was introduced to Abrihim, a convert to Islam who lived beside the mosque.

Harkat said that he would be persecuted by the Algerian government if he returned, due to his past membership in the FIS.Personal Information Form (PIF) for people claiming convention refugee status, filled out by Harkat His claim was accepted on February 24, 1997. In March, he applied for Permanent Resident status. While attending prayers at the Ottawa Mosque on Northwestern Avenue, he met Mohamed el-Barseigy, who was looking for someone to share his apartment. Accepting el-Barseigy's offer of a drive back to Toronto, Harkat was introduced to Ahmed Khadr, who was also in the van. Harkat has said that Khadr was silent during most of the trip, and his only advice to Harkat was \\"tell the truth to immigration authorities.\\" (A Federal Court justice commented that this was \\"inherently implausible and incredible\\".)Federal Court of Canada, \\"Reasons for denial of bail to Mohamed Harkat\\" They never met again after the 5-hour drive.Duffy, Andrew. \\"Ottawa man a terrorist, judge rules\\", Ottawa Citizen, March 23, 2005 Harkat was also in contact with Fahad al-Shehri, who was later deported from the country.

It later came to light that one of the CSIS agents detailed to collect information on Harkat had been Theresa Sullivan, who had been fired in 2002 after she carried on an extramarital affair with one of her informants. Given this behavior, Harkat questioned in court whether information she provided about him to CSIS was reliable. ==Marriage and family== Harkat married Canadian citizen Sophie Lamarche. ==Arrest== Mohamed Harkat is represented in a 2004 protest outside the Toronto office of CSIS. Harkat was arrested in Ottawa on December 10, 2002 as a threat to national security, after a security certificate was issued on the recommendation of CSIS. Its officers relied upon secret evidence that has not been revealed due to national security concerns.Media for Social Change, \\"Measuring Security Measures\\", National Film Board Public statements indicated that Abu Zubaydah, who was waterboarded during harsh interrogations by the United States, described a man \\"similar to\\" Harkat running a guest house in Pakistan that shuttled mujahideen to Chechnya, although he did not use Harkat's name. This led the United States to accuse Harkat of \\"assisting terrorists, including the September 11 hijackers\\".Library of Congress, Federal Research Division. \\"Asian Criminal and Terrorist Activity in Canada\\", July 2003 On March 22, 2005, Federal Court judge Eleanor Dawson ruled that the security certificate binding Harkat was reasonable. On December 30 of that year, a federal court judge dismissed Harkat's application for release.CBC, \\"Court refuses to order Harkat's release\\", December 30, 2005 In April 2006, he was moved, along with the other four detainees, to a section at the Millhaven Institution specifically built for those held under security certificates. ==Release and subsequent trials== On May 23, 2006, Harkat was released on a $100,000 bail by Justice Dawson. The release conditions stipulated that he be in the company of his wife, Sophie Harkat, or mother-in-law, Pierrette Brunette, at all times. Additionally, Harkat was required to wear a tracking bracelet and was prohibited from using electronic means of communication. Any trips outside of his house were to be approved by the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) 48 hours in advance. The CBSA were also allowed constant access to his house, were required to approve any visitors to the house, and had two agents accompany him on any outings.CBC, \\"The CSIS case against Mohamed Harka\\"t, CBC, July 17, 2006 On June 13–14, 2006, the Supreme Court of Canada heard the case of Harkat v. Canada on the constitutionality of security certificates. On December 22, Harkat's lawyer, Paul Copeland, announced that Federal Court Chief Justice Allan Lutfy would grant a judicial review of the original deportation order in Federal Court.CBC, \\"Harkat Deportation , December 22, 2006 The Canada Border Services Agency added six full-time positions for surveillance agents to follow Harkat at all times, at an annual cost of $868,700, as well as purchasing a new $31,000 car for the tailing, and spent $5,000 monthly to have staff monitoring Harkat's tracking bracelet. On January 29, 2008, CBSA agents entered Harkat's home while he was showering, and placed him under arrest. They cited a breach of bail conditions, since his mother-in- law had not stayed at the house for several days following an argument with her husband.Radio Canada, \\"Mohamed Harkat arrêté\\", Radio Canada, January 30, 2008 He was released after being questioned about the matter. On September 24, 2008, judge Simon Noël ruled that CSIS must disclose their \\"secret\\" evidence against Harkat, allowing him and his lawyers to view the material.Toronto Star, \\"Terror suspect wins right to see CSIS material\\", September 24, 2008 CSIS said this could take up to six months. Six months later, Judge Noël ordered the release conditions be loosened, allowing Harkat to remain home alone without requiring his wife to be present at all times.Toronto Star, \\"Did spy's affair taint case against terror suspect?\\", Toronto Star, March 7, 2009 In May 2009, judge Noël had said that the unwillingness of CSIS to share its material regarding the reliability of an informant who gave evidence against Harkat was \\"troubling.\\" He ordered them to disclose the confidential files to Harkat's defence lawyers who held security clearance.Toronto Star, \\"Judge slams CSIS actions in Harkat terror case\\", Toronto Star, May 27, 2009 CSIS claimed to have destroyed all original copies of their evidence, and offered copies to the court and defence lawyers. In May 2014, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that security certificate process used against Harkat was fair and reasonable. While this theoretically cleared the way for his deportation to Algeria, the risk that he could be tortured if returned requires the Canada Border Services Agency to balance these risks prior to removing him from Canada. In March 2016 filmmaker Alexandre Trudeau, the younger brother of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, wrote a letter to Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale asking that Harkat be allowed to stay, causing Erin O'Toole, the Conservative public safety critic and Democracy Watch to demand the Prime Minister recuse himself from any decision regarding Harkat. == Danger Opinion Process == The decision on the reasonableness of Harkat's security certificate became final when it was upheld by the Supreme Court of Canada in 2014. That said, his removal process remains outstanding. The CBSA sought a danger opinion from the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness to determine whether Mr. Harkat poses a danger to national security or whether the nature and severity of the acts committed reach a serious level of gravity and if so, whether the risk to Mr. Harkat of deporting him outweighs the danger. The danger opinion package with Mr. Harkat’s submissions was provided to Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada for decision on March 8, 2017, and a senior officer was assigned to the case on March 31, 2017, for consideration. A decision was then reached in his case on October 2, 2018 in which the Minister’s Delegate determined that Mr. Harkat, a citizen of Algeria, should not be allowed to remain in Canada based on the nature and severity of the acts he committed.Harkat, Mohamed v.

Harkat's lawyer, Barbara Jackman, told Al Jazeera she filed for a judicial review of his deportation order in November 2018. She indicated to Al Jazeera that as of December 2019 the Federal Court has not received all the information on which the government based its removal decision, and without the complete record, it is unclear when the case will proceed. That counsel stated that she will not act for Mr. Harkat on a legal aid certificate. She applied to court seeking an enhanced hourly fee and the payment of experts’ fees, an application which was denied on the basis that Mr. Harkat had not appealed his denial of legal aid and had provided insufficient information to the court about his finances.Harkat, Mohamed v.

As long as their ears remain unclipped they will never age; for this reason, they wear woollen hats pulled low over their ears in order to remain undetected by the authorities, who find their freedom threatening to the social order. Borribles are skinny, scruffy, and tough; they have nothing to do with money, and steal what they need to survive. Following on from the adventures of The Great Rumble Hunt, the second volume of The Borrible Trilogy begins with the surviving adventurers discovery that Sam the horse is still alive. In attempting to rescue him the Borribles are lured into danger both by the newly-established Special Borrible Group, a branch of the police determined to wipe out the Borribles and their way of life, and by one of their own – Spiff, whose motives behind the mission to Rumbledom are slowly revealed.

Under standard conditions, it is a colorless liquid. It is hydrophobic, and thus insoluble in water, but miscible with oils. Farnesol is produced from 5-carbon isoprene compounds in both plants and animals. Phosphate-activated derivatives of farnesol are the building blocks of possibly all,l acyclic sesquiterpenoids. These compounds are doubled to form 30-carbon squalene, which in turn is the precursors for steroids in plants, animals, and fungi. As such, farnesol and its derivatives are important starting compounds for both natural and artificial organic synthesis. ==Uses== Farnesol is present in many essential oils such as citronella, neroli, cyclamen, lemon grass, tuberose, rose, musk, balsam, and tolu. It is used in perfumery to emphasize the odors of sweet, floral perfumes. It enhances perfume scent by acting as a co-solvent that regulates the volatility of the odorants. It is especially used in lilac perfumes. Farnesol is a natural pesticide for mites and is a pheromone for several other insects. In a 1994 report released by five top cigarette companies, farnesol was listed as one of 599 additives to cigarettes. It is a flavoring ingredient. ==Natural source and synthesis== Farnesol is produced from isoprene compounds in both plants and animals. When geranyl pyrophosphate reacts with isopentenyl pyrophosphate, the result is the 15-carbon farnesyl pyrophosphate, which is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of sesquiterpenes such as farnesene. Oxidation can then provide sesquiterpenoids such as farnesol. Farnesyl pyrophosphate ==History of the name== Farnesol is found in a flower extract with a long history of use in perfumery. The pure substance farnesol was named (c. 1900–1905) after the Farnese acacia tree (Vachellia farnesiana), since the flowers from the tree were the commercial source of the floral essence in which the chemical was identified. This particular acacia species, in turn, is named after Cardinal Odoardo Farnese (1573–1626) of the notable Italian Farnese family which (from 1550 though the 17th century) maintained some of the first private European botanical gardens in the Farnese Gardens in Rome. The addition of the -ol ending results from it being chemically an alcohol.http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/farnesol Etymology of farnesol, accessed August 27, 2009. The plant itself was brought to the Farnese gardens from the Caribbean and Central America, where it originates.HENRY TRIMBLE AND F. D. MACFARLAND., AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACY, Volume 57, #3, March, 1885 ==Health effects== Farnesol has been suggested to function as a chemopreventative and anti-tumor agent. Farnesol is used as a deodorant in cosmetic products because of its anti-bacterial activity. Farnesol is subject to restrictions on its use in perfumery as some people may become sensitised to it, however the evidence that farnesol can cause an allergic reaction in humans is disputed. In a study, researchers found in a tissue culture that Balsam of Peru and farnesol were able to bind to CD1a molecules on the surface of Langerhans cells and active T cells. However, researcher de Jong notes that, \\"Our work shows how these chemicals can activate T cells in tissue culture, but we have to be cautious about claiming that this is definitively how it works in allergic patients.

One word more and I – I withdraw my overdraft!\\" \\\\---- Cartoon from Punch Magazine Vol. 152, June 27, 1917 An overdraft occurs when money is withdrawn from a bank account and the available balance goes below zero. In this situation the account is said to be \\"overdrawn\\". If there is a prior agreement with the account provider for an overdraft, and the amount overdrawn is within the authorized overdraft limit, then interest is normally charged at the agreed rate. If the negative balance exceeds the agreed terms, then additional fees may be charged and higher interest rates may apply. ==History== The first overdraft facility was set up in 1728 by the Royal Bank of Scotland. The merchant William Hogg was having problems in balancing his books and was able to come to an agreement with the newly established bank that allowed him to withdraw money from his empty account to pay his debts before he received his payments. He was thus the first recipient of cash credit from a bank in the world. Within decades, the advantages of this system, both for customers and banks, became apparent, and banks across the United Kingdom adopted this innovation. With the onset of industrialization, new businesses needed an easy form of credit to jump-start their activities, without having to take out loans on securities they did not necessarily have. The importance of this new financial innovation was recognized by the philosopher David Hume who described it in one of his essays as \\"one of the most ingenious ideas that has been executed in commerce\\". ==Reasons for overdrafts== Overdrafts occur for a variety of reasons. These may include: *Intentional loan – The account holder finds themselves short of money and knowingly makes an insufficient-funds debit. They accept the associated fees and cover the overdraft with their next deposit. *Failure to maintain an accurate account register – The account holder fails to accurately account for activity on their account and overspends through negligence. *ATM overdraft – Banks or ATMs may allow cash withdrawals despite insufficient availability of funds. The account holder may or may not be aware of this fact at the time of the withdrawal. If the ATM is unable to communicate with the cardholder's bank, it may automatically authorize a withdrawal based on limits preset by the authorizing network. *Temporary deposit hold – A deposit made to the account can be placed on hold by the bank. This may be due to Regulation CC (which governs the placement of holds on deposited checks) or due to individual bank policies. The funds may not be immediately available and lead to overdraft fees. *Unexpected electronic withdrawals – At some point in the past the account holder may have authorized electronic withdrawals by a business. This could occur in good faith of both parties if the electronic withdrawal in question is made legally possible by terms of the contract, such as the initiation of a recurring service following a free trial period. The debit could also have been made as a result of a wage garnishment, an offset claim for a taxing agency or a credit account or overdraft with another account with the same bank, or a direct-deposit chargeback in order to recover an overpayment. *Merchant error – A merchant may improperly debit a customer's account due to human error. For example, a customer may authorize a $5.00 purchase which may post to the account for $500.00. The customer has the option to recover these funds through chargeback to the merchant. *Chargeback to merchant – A merchant account could receive a chargeback because of making an improper credit or debit card charge to a customer or a customer making an unauthorized credit or debit card charge to someone else's account in order to \\"pay\\" for goods services from the merchant. It is possible for the chargeback and associated fee to cause an overdraft or leave insufficient funds to cover a subsequent withdrawal or debit from the merchant's account that received the chargeback. *Authorization holds – When a customer makes a purchase using their debit card without using their PIN, the transaction is treated as a credit transaction. The funds are placed on hold in the customer's account reducing the customer's available balance. However, the merchant does not receive the funds until they processes the transaction batch for the period during which the customer's purchase was made. Banks do not hold these funds indefinitely, and so the bank may release the hold before the merchant collects the funds, thus making these funds available again. If the customer spends these funds, then, barring an interim deposit, the account will overdraw when the merchant collects for the original purchase. *Bank fees – The bank charges a fee unexpected to the account holder, creating a negative balance or leaving insufficient funds for a subsequent debit from the same account. *' – The account holder makes a debit while insufficient funds are present in the account believing he will be able to deposit sufficient funds before the debit clears. While many cases of playing the float are done with honest intentions, the time involved in the cheque's clearing and the difference in the processing of debits and credits are exploited by those committing cheque kiting. *Returned cheque deposit – The account holder deposits a cheque or money order and the deposited item is returned due to non-sufficient funds, a closed account, or being discovered to be counterfeit, stolen, altered, or forged. As a result of the cheque chargeback and associated fee, an overdraft results or a subsequent debit which was reliant on such funds causes one. This could be due to a deposited item that is known to be bad, or the customer could be a victim of a bad cheque or a counterfeit cheque scam. If the resulting overdraft is too large or cannot be covered in a short period of time, the bank could sue or even press criminal charges. *Intentional fraud – An ATM deposit with misrepresented funds is made or a cheque or money order known to be bad is deposited (see above) by the account holder, and enough money is debited before the fraud is discovered to result in an overdraft once the chargeback is made. The fraud could be perpetrated against one's own account, another person's account, or an account set up in another person's name by an identity thief. *Bank error – A cheque debit may post for an improper amount due to human or computer error, so an amount much larger than the maker intended may be removed from the account. Some bank errors can work to the account holder's detriment, but others could work to their benefit. *Victimization – The account may have been a target of identity theft. This could occur as the result of demand-draft, ATM-card, or debit-card fraud, skimming, cheque forgery, an \\"account takeover\\", or phishing. The criminal act could cause an overdraft or cause a subsequent debit to cause one. The money or cheques from an ATM deposit could also have been stolen or the envelope lost or stolen, in which case the victim is often denied a remedy. *Intraday overdraft – A debit occurs in the customer's account resulting in an overdraft which is then covered by a credit that posts to the account during the same business day. Whether this actually results in overdraft fees depends on the deposit-account holder agreement of the particular bank. *Merchant overdraft – An unsecured overdraft offered by financial institutions to a merchant, and the amount overdrawn is within the authorized overdraft limit, which is usually of very high value. ==United Kingdom== Banks in the UK normally offer an overdraft facility free of charge, subject to a pre-arranged limit (formerly known as an authorized overdraft limit). Interest, fees or both would normally be charged if the facility is used but accounts may have an interest-free buffer of a few tens of pounds or a higher deliberate feature of a few hundred pounds interest free. When a transaction would exceed the previously agreed overdraft limit the bank can choose either to decline the transaction or to accept it as an informal request for an increase, formerly often known as an unauthorized overdraft. Charges and interest rates for informal increases will often exceed those for a formal request. There is also normally a fee per declined transaction, often subject to monthly caps. Usually, the bank sends out a letter informing the customer of the charge and requesting that the account be operated within its limits from that point onwards or informing the customer of their new limit. In a BBC Whistleblower programme on the practice, it was noted that the actual cost to the bank was less than two pounds. Accounts exist with overdraft protection facilities which guarantee that the bank will not allow an informal overdraft and which may have lower charges for refusing transactions, protecting the customer from the interest and charges which would be incurred if an overdraft was granted. Accounts for those under eighteen years old will not normally permit an overdraft to be created. === Amount of fees === No major UK bank has completely dropped informal overdraft charges. Some, however, offer a \\"buffer zone\\", where customers will not be charged if they are over their limit by less than a certain amount. Other banks tend to charge fees regardless of the amount of the level of the overdraft, which is seen by some as unfair. In response to criticism, Lloyds Banking Group changed its fee structure; rather than a single monthly fee for an unauthorized overdraft, they now charge per day. They also allow a 'grace period' where an account holder can pay money in before 2:30pm on a weekday before any items are returned. Alliance & Leicester formerly had a buffer zone facility (marketed as a \\"last few pounds\\" feature of their account), but this has been withdrawn. In general, the fee charged for an informal request is between £25 and £30, along with an increased rate of debit interest. The charges for cheques and Direct Debits which are refused (or \\"bounced\\") due to insufficient funds are usually the same as or slightly less than the general overdraft fees, and can be charged on top of them. A situation which has provoked much controversy is the bank declining a cheque/Direct Debit, levying a fee which takes the customer overdrawn and then charging them for going overdrawn. However, some banks, like Halifax, have a \\"no fees on fees\\" policy whereby an account that goes overdrawn solely because of an unpaid item fee will not be charged an additional fee. === Legal status and controversy === In 2006 the Office of Fair Trading issued a statement which concluded that credit card issuers were levying penalty charges when customers exceeded their maximum spend limit and / or made late payments to their accounts. In the statement, the OFT recommended that credit card issuers set such fees at a maximum of £12. In the statement, the OFT opined that the fees charged by credit card issuers were analogous to unauthorized overdraft fees charged by banks. Many customers who incurred unauthorized overdraft fees used this statement as a springboard to sue their banks in order to recover the fees. The Supreme Court in 2009 held that the OFT statement was not binding for current (checking) accounts and largely resolved the matter in favor of the banks. ==United States== ===Consumer reporting and account denial === In the United States some consumer reporting agencies such as ChexSystems, Early Warning Services, and TeleCheck track how people manage their checking accounts. Banks use the agencies to screen checking account applicants. Those with low debit scores are denied checking accounts because a bank can not afford an account to be overdrawn. ===Overdraft protection=== Overdraft protection is a financial service offered by banking institutions primarily in the United States. Overdraft or courtesy pay program protection pays items presented to a customer's account when sufficient funds are not present to cover the amount of the withdrawal. Overdraft protection can cover ATM withdrawals, purchases made with a debit card, electronic transfers, and checks. In the case of non-preauthorized items such as checks, or ACH withdrawals, overdraft protection allows for these items to be paid as opposed to being returned unpaid, or bouncing. However, ATM withdrawals and purchases made with a debit or check card are considered preauthorized and must be paid by the bank when presented, even if this causes an overdraft. ====Ad hoc coverage==== Traditionally, the manager of a bank would look at the bank's list of overdrafts each day. If the manager saw that a favored customer had incurred an overdraft, they had the discretion to pay the overdraft for the customer. Banks traditionally did not charge for this ad hoc coverage. However, it was fully discretionary, and so could not be depended on. With the advent of large-scale interstate branch banking, traditional ad hoc coverage has practically disappeared. The one exception to this is so-called \\"force pay\\" lists. At the beginning of each business day, branch managers often still get a computerized list of items that are pending rejection, only for accounts held in their specific branch, city or state. Generally, if a customer is able to come into the branch with cash or make a transfer to cover the amount of the item pending rejection, the manager can \\"force pay\\" the item. In addition, if there are extenuating circumstances or the item in question is from an account held by a regular customer, the manager may take a risk by paying the item, but this is increasingly uncommon. Banks have a cut-off time when this action must take place by, as after that time, the item automatically switches from \\"pending rejection\\" to \\"rejected\\", and no further action may be taken. ====Overdraft lines of credit==== This form of overdraft protection is a contractual relationship in which the bank promises to pay overdrafts up to a certain dollar limit. A consumer who wants an overdraft line of credit must complete and sign an application, after which the bank checks the consumer's credit and approves or denies the application. These lines of credit are loans and must comply with the Truth in Lending Act. As with linked accounts, banks typically charge a nominal fee per overdraft, and also charge interest on the outstanding balance. Some banks charge a small monthly fee regardless of whether the line of credit is used. This form of overdraft protection is available to consumers who meet the creditworthiness criteria established by the bank for such accounts. Once the line of credit is established, the available credit may be visible as part of the customer's available balance. ====Linked accounts==== Also referred to as \\"Overdraft Transfer Protection\\", a checking account can be linked to another account, such as a savings account, credit card, or line of credit. Once the link is established, when an item is presented to the checking account that would result in an overdraft, funds are transferred from the linked account to cover the overdraft. A nominal fee is usually charged for each overdraft transfer, and if the linked account is a credit card or other line of credit, the consumer may be required to pay interest under the terms of that account. The main difference between linked accounts and an overdraft line of credit is that an overdraft line of credit is typically only usable for overdraft protection. Separate accounts that are linked for overdraft protection are independent accounts in their own right. ====Bounce protection plans==== A more recent product being offered by some banks is called \\"bounce protection\\". Smaller banks offer plans administered by third party companies which help the banks gain additional fee income. Larger banks tend not to offer bounce protection plans, but instead process overdrafts as disclosed in their account terms and conditions. In either case, the bank may choose to cover overdrawn items at their discretion and charge an overdraft fee, the amount of which may or may not be disclosed. As opposed to traditional ad hoc coverage, this decision to pay or not pay overdrawn items is automated and based on objective criteria such as the customer's average balance, the overdraft history of the account, the number of accounts the customer holds with the bank, and the length of time those accounts have been open. However, the bank does not promise to pay the overdraft even if the automated criteria are met. Bounce protection plans have some superficial similarities to overdraft lines of credit and ad hoc coverage of overdrafts, but tend to operate under different rules. Like an overdraft line of credit, the balance of the bounce protection plan may be viewable as part of the customer's available balance, yet the bank reserves the right to refuse payment of an overdrawn item, as with traditional ad hoc coverage. Banks typically charge a one-time fee for each overdraft paid. A bank may also charge a recurring daily fee for each day during which the account has a negative balance. Critics argue that because funds are advanced to a consumer and repayment is expected, bounce protection is a type of loan. Because banks are not contractually obligated to cover the overdrafts, \\"bounce protection\\" is not regulated by the Truth in Lending Act, which prohibits certain deceptive advertisements and requires disclosure of the terms of loans. Historically, bounce protection could be added to a consumer's account without his or her permission or knowledge. ===Transaction processing order=== An area of controversy with regards to overdraft fees is the order in which a bank posts transactions to a customer's account. Processing debits from largest to smallest will maximize the number (but not value) of overdrawn debits on a customer's account. This situation can arise when the account holder makes a number of small debits for which there are sufficient funds in the account at the time of purchase. Later, the account holder makes a large debit that overdraws the account (either accidentally or intentionally). If all of the items present for payment to the account on the same day, and the bank processes the largest transaction first, multiple overdrafts can result. Another problem for the consumer can occur when a large deposit and a larger debit occur on the same day; for example, a customer with $700 in their account who deposits a $600 paycheck and later pays an $800 rent check on the same day will be charged an overdraft fee, despite having more than enough money in their account to cover the check. The \\"biggest check first\\" policy is common among large U.S. banks. Banks argue that this is done to prevent a customer's most important transactions (such as a rent or mortgage check, or utility payment) from being returned unpaid, despite some such transactions being guaranteed. Consumers have attempted to litigate to prevent this practice, arguing that banks use \\"biggest check first\\" to manipulate the order of transactions to artificially trigger more overdraft fees to collect. Banks in the United States are mostly regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, a Federal agency, which has formally approved of the practice; the practice has recently been challenged, however, under numerous individual state deceptive practice laws. In class action, U.S. Bank Corporation entered into a $55 million settlement agreement on January 16, 2014 over the practice of reordering transactions (highest-lowest) in posting debit card transactions to customer accounts and the alleged effect the posting order had on the number of overdraft fees charged to account holders. Bank deposit agreements usually provide that the bank may clear transactions in any order, at the bank's discretion. ===Opt-in regulation=== In July, 2010 the Federal Reserve adopted regulations (revisions to Regulation E) which prohibited overdraft fees resulting from one time debit card and ATM transactions unless the bank customer had opted into overdraft protection. Consumers who opt into overdraft programs pay more than seven times as much in overdraft and NSF fees, averaging almost $260 a year, based on a recent report from the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Research by Moebs Services released in February, 2011 showed that as many as 90% of customers had chosen overdraft protection resulting in the projection that United States banks would post record profits from overdraft fees. ===Alternatives to overdraft protection=== Fintech innovations and overdraft protection apps have led to viable alternatives to overdraft fees. ==References== Category:Banking terms Category:Financial law Category:Debt ","title":"Overdraft"},{"id":"3238827","text":"Rovo is a Japanese instrumental band founded in 1996 in Tokyo by former Boredoms guitarist Seiichi Yamamoto, Bondage Fruit electric violinist Yuji Katsui, and synthesizer/effects technician Tatsuki Masuko, and featuring Yasuhiro Yoshigaki on drums and percussion, Youichi Okabe on drums and percussion, and Jin Harada on bass guitar.

Originally editor of Mayfair and the British edition of Penthouse, Graham Masterton's first novel The Manitou was released in 1976. This novel was adapted in 1978 for the film The Manitou. Further works garnered critical acclaim, including a Special Edgar Award by the Mystery Writers of America for Charnel House and a Silver Medal by the West Coast Review of Books for Tengu. He is also the only non- French winner of the prestigious Prix Julia Verlanger for his novel Family Portrait, an imaginative reworking of the Oscar Wilde novel The Picture of Dorian Gray. Masterton was also the editor of Scare Care, a horror anthology published for the benefit of abused children in Europe and the U.S. Masterton's novels often contain visceral sex and horror. In addition to his novels, Masterton has written a number of sex instruction books, including How To Drive Your Man Wild In Bed and Wild Sex for New Lovers. Masterton lives in Surrey, England. His wife and agent Wiescka died on 27 April 2011, aged 65. In 2002, while living with his wife in Cork, Ireland, he added crime fiction to his repertoire with A Terrible Beauty featuring Irish Detective Superintendent Katie Maguire. This was republished in 2013 as White Bones and sold 100,000 ebook copies in a month. It is to be followed by further Katie Maguire adventures, Broken Angels (2013), Red Light (2014), \\"Taken For Dead\\" (2014), \\"Blood Sisters\\" (2015), \\"Buried\\" (2015), Living Death\\" (2016), \\"Dead Girls Dancing\\" (2016) and \\"Dead Men Whistling\\" (2018\\". In 2010, Masterton published Rules of Duel, a short novel from the early 1970s that he wrote in collaboration with William S. Burroughs (Burroughs has co-author credit). In 2017, after a visit to Wolow, the maximum security prison near Wroclaw in southern Poland, Masterton set up the Graham Masterton Written In Prison Award (Nagroda Grahama Mastertona W Wiezieniu Pisane) for the inmates of all of Poland's penal institutions to enter a short story contest. The contest is now an annual event and is supported by the Polish Prison Service, the Wroclaw Agglomeration for Culture and Sport, both Rebis and Albatros publishing houses and the Wroclaw Library. The Prix Graham Masterton is organized annually in Belgium by the publisher Marc Bailly for the best French horror novel and short story of the year. The first prize is a sculpture of a demon. In 2019, Graham Masterton was given a Lifetime Achievement Award by the Horror Writers' Association. ==Bibliography== ===Horror=== *The Djinn (featuring Harry Erskine of The Manitou series), 1977 *The Sphinx, 1978 *Charnel House, 1978 *The Devils of D-Day, 1978 *The Hell Candidate, 1981 *The Heirloom, 1981 *The Wells of Hell (loosely based on H.

The reservoir's large capacity of around 45,330 megalitres and its location in the catchment area mean that it only ever fills completely once in every five years. Costing A$6.4 million, the reservoir took almost a decade to construct, between 1949 and 1958, due to a demand on resources in the post-war boom. The building of the historic Mannum–Adelaide pipeline from the River Murray to the water-short city of Adelaide was a key delay in South Para's construction; that pipeline today disperses water into the reservoir. The Reservoir is surrounded by nature reserve and has been a focus for two major revegetation projects, the first in the late 1950s when over 5000 trees and shrubs were planted, and the second as part of the South Australian Government's \\"Million Trees\\" initiative. In 1979 the mutilated body of 17-year-old Alan Barnes was found after being dumped in the South Para Reservoir.

The plains north of the town are home to one of the few great bustard populations in Germany. Since 2003, when 14 surrounding villages were incorporated into Bad Belzig, some of them voluntarily, others by Brandenburg Landtag (state parliament) legislation, Bad Belzig has an area of 234.83 km².

Whether this denotation refers to Bad Belzig or the neighbouring town of Beelitz has not been conclusively established. Nevertheless, both towns celebrated their 1000 years anniversary in 1997. Eisenhardt Castle St Mary's Church The estates however had actually already been lost in the Slavic uprising of 983 and were not conquered again until 1153 by Albert the Bear from the House of Ascania. In 1251 the castle (Burg Eisenhardt) and the adjacent settlement became part of Saxe-Wittenberg under Albert's successor Duke Albert I. However it was claimed by the archbishops of Magdeburg, whose forces devastated Belzig in 1406. The rebuilt castle was again seized by the Hussite general Prokop the Great when he invaded Saxony in 1429, after which Elector Ernest of Saxony from the House of Wettin enlarged it to a fortress. During the Thirty Years' War it was seized by the troops of the Swedish Empire in 1636, after Elector John George I had allied with Emperor Ferdinand II in the Peace of Prague. The Romanesque St Mary's Church was built in the late 13th century. According to an inscription in the keystone of the western entrance, Martin Luther preached here on January 14, 1530.

During the War of the Sixth Coalition on August 27, 1813 troops of the French Empire and Saxony were attacked by Prussian and Russian forces near the village of Hagelberg. The encounter ended in a French defeat, while several Saxon units went over to the Prussians. According to the Final Act of the 1815 Congress of Vienna Bad Belzig was ceded to Prussia and became part of the Province of Brandenburg, after having belonged to the Saxon Electorate for centuries. In 1934 ammunition works were established in Bad Belzig including a labor camp with about 1500 forced laborers. During the years 1936–1945, Burg Eisenhardt was the site of the Reichsschule (leadership school) for the Technischen Nothilfe ('technical emergency relief'). (The Technische Nothilfe was abolished in May, 1945, but the idea was revived by Otto Lummitzsch in the form of the Technisches Hilfswerk in 1950, which exists to this day as one of the pillars of the German civil protection infrastructure.) Between 1940 and 1945 a subcamp of the women's concentration camp Ravensbrück with about 750 inmates was also located nearby. Bad Belzig was also the site of a large radio transmitter station, erected in 1939. In 1952 the town became the capital of the Belzig district and in 1993 of the newly created district of Potsdam- Mittelmark.

As a reserve unit, it has a status roughly equivalent to that of a British Army Reserve unit or United States Army National Guard unit. ==History== ===Origin=== The history of this Regiment dates back to the Transvaal Cycle Corps, which was formed in Johannesburg on 1 October 1905 from the Bicycle Section of the Transvaal Scottish Regiment. A small section of this unit subsequently took part in the suppression of the Bambata Rebellion in Zululand. After its return from this conflict the unit recognised the possibilities of mechanisation and members of the Regiment manufactured three armoured cars, creating a motorised fighting unit. This led to the renaming of the unit in 1909 to the Transvaal Cycle and Motor Corps. On 1 July 1913 the Regiment was renamed the 11th Infantry (Rand Light Infantry) and transferred to the Active Citizen Force of the Union Defence Force. Simultaneously, the unit was converted to a normal infantry regiment. The Regiment's Pretoria detachment was transferred to the 12th Infantry (Pretoria Regiment). ===World War One=== During World War I the Regiment took part in the South-West Africa, suffering light casualties – only two dead and eleven wounded. In 1932 the Regiment was renamed the Rand Light Infantry. ===World War Two=== The RLI was mobilized for World War II in June 1940 and gained fame in North Africa where it took part in many front line engagements and earned battle honours at Bardia, Gazala and El Alamein.

He played college football at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, where, in 1936, he was the runner-up for the Heisman Trophy.College Football Hall of Fame Inductees Francis was also an exceptional athlete in track and field and placed fourth in the shot put at the 1936 Summer Olympics. Francis was the first overall selection in the 1937 NFL Draft by the Philadelphia Eagles. His rights were traded to the Chicago Bears in exchange for Bill Hewitt and $4,000 in cash on February 15, 1937.Lyons, 2010, p. 70. He played in the NFL for four years with the Bears, Pittsburgh Pirates, and Brooklyn Dodgers before leaving to get a master's degree at the University of Iowa and serve in the Army during World War II. After gaining experience serving as head coach for the football team at Camp Lee during World War II, Francis was hired as the head football coach at Kansas State University for the 1947 season. Francis coached at Kansas State for one year, compiling a record of 0–10. Francis remained in the Army, serving in Korea and Vietnam, and held the rank of lieutenant colonel upon retirement. He is buried in Springfield National Cemetery. ==Coaching career== Francis served as the 21st head football coach at Kansas State University, helming the team for the 1947 season. He is the only Kansas State football coach to lose every game that he coached. The program's first coach, Ira Pratt, was winless in his one season in 1896, but tallied one tie for a record of 0–1–1. Francis' 1947 Kansas State squad was outscored 283 to 71, and was shut out on three occasions. Their closest contest was a two-point loss to New Mexico at home, and their most lopsided defeat was a 55–0 rout by rival Kansas. ===Head coaching record=== ==Athletic honors== Francis was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame and the Kansas Sports Hall of Fame. ==References== ==Sources== * Lyons, Robert S.

It is chemically and optically similar in many respects to other copper minerals such as malachite and brochantite, though it can be distinguished from the former by a lack of effervescence in hydrochloric acid. Antlerite is a common corrosion product on bronze sculptures located in urban areas, where atmospheric sulfur dioxide (a common pollutant) is present. Antlerite forms mainly in sheltered areas where weathering is low, which permits accumulation of copper ions and enhancement in the acidity of water films.Leygraf C, Graedel TE.

On the one hand one would like to account for a universe which on its largest observational scales appears remarkably spatially homogeneous and isotropic in its physical properties (and so can be described by a simple Friedmann–Lemaître model), on the other hand there is the deep question on the origin of the second law of thermodynamics. Penrose suggests that the resolution of both of these problems is rooted in a concept of the entropy content of gravitational fields. Near the initial cosmological singularity (the Big Bang), he proposes, the entropy content of the cosmological gravitational field was extremely low (compared to what it theoretically could have been), and started rising monotonically thereafter. This process manifested itself e.g. in the formation of structure through the clumping of matter to form galaxies and clusters of galaxies. Penrose associates the initial low entropy content of the universe with the effective vanishing of the Weyl curvature tensor of the cosmological gravitational field near the Big Bang. From then on, he proposes, its dynamical influence gradually increased, thus being responsible for an overall increase in the amount of entropy in the universe, and so inducing a cosmological arrow of time. The Weyl curvature represents such gravitational effects as tidal fields and gravitational radiation. Mathematical treatments of Penrose's ideas on the Weyl curvature hypothesis have been given in the context of isotropic initial cosmological singularities e.g. in the articles. Penrose views the Weyl curvature hypothesis as a physically more credible alternative to cosmic inflation (a hypothetical phase of accelerated expansion in the early life of the universe) in order to account for the presently observed almost spatial homogeneity and isotropy of our universe. ==See also== *Gravitational singularity *Unsolved problems in physics *White hole == References == Category:Physical cosmology Category:General relativity ","title":"Weyl curvature hypothesis"},{"id":"3238953","text":"Water feature stone waterfall.

Computerized musical water feature in National Harbor, MD In landscape architecture and garden design, a water feature is one or more items from a range of fountains, jeux d'eau, pools, ponds, rills, artificial waterfalls, and streams. Before the 18th century they were usually powered by gravity, though the famous Hanging Gardens of Babylon are described by Strabo as supplied by an Archimedean screw and other examples were supplied with water using hydraulic rams. Ancient water features were powered using gravitational forces, human power or animals to pump in the water. Since the 18th century, the majority of water features have been powered by pumps. In the past, the power source was sometimes a steam engine, but in modern features it is almost always powered by electricity. There is an increasing range of innovative designs as the market becomes more established and people become more aware of alternate installation methods, such as solar power. The advantages of using solar power include environmental benefits, no electrical lines in the garden, and free energy. Modern water features are typically self-contained, meaning that they do not require water to be plumbed in; rather water is recycled from either a pond or a hidden reservoir, also known as a sump. The sump can either be contained within the water feature, or buried underground (in the case of an outdoor water feature). A water feature may be indoor or outdoor and can range in size from a desk top water fountain to a large indoor waterfall that covers an entire wall in a large building, and can be made from any number of materials, including stone, stainless steel, resin, iron and glass. Most water features are electronically controlled, ranging from simple timer actuators to sophisticated computerized controls for synchronizing music to water and light animation. Water features often offer additional benefits to homeowners, such as increased curb appeal, home value, reduced noise pollution (due to the sound of water overpowering outside noise), increased humidity in dry regions and improved air quality. ==History== In early modern Europe, fountains were found in the elaborate gardens of the mansions of the wealthy, and in modern times can be an element in urban design provided by the municipal authorities or public subscription. Water features are often found in gardens of middle class houses. A notable modern example is the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fountain in London, England. ==See also== *Crystal Fountains *Hercules monument (Kassel) – example of an almost 300-year-old water feature *Musical fountain *Rain chain *Water garden ==References== ==External links== * Category:Water Category:Horticulture and gardening Category:Garden features ","title":"Water feature"},{"id":"3238971","text":"James Jackson Kilpatrick (November 1, 1920 – August 15, 2010) was an American newspaper journalist, columnist, author, writer and grammarian. During the 1950s and early 1960s he was editor of The Richmond News Leader in Richmond, Virginia and encouraged the Massive Resistance strategy to oppose the U.S. Supreme Court's decisions in the Brown v. Board of Education ruling which outlawed racial segregation in public schools. For three decades beginning in the mid-1960s, Kilpatrick wrote a nationally syndicated column \\"A Conservative View\\", and for years also sparred with liberals Nicholas von Hoffman and later Shana Alexander on the television news program 60 Minutes.Civil Rights Greensboro: James J. Kilpatrick ==Early and family life== Kilpatrick was born and raised in Oklahoma City. His father lost the family lumber business during the Great Depression, which led to his parents' divorce. Kilpatrick earned a degree in journalism from the University of Missouri in 1941. Kilpatrick married sculptor Marie Louise Pietri in 1942. She died in 1997. They had three sons, M. Sean Kilpatrick of Atlanta, Christopher Kilpatrick of New Bern, N.C., and Kevin Kilpatrick. In 1998, Kilpatrick married liberal Washington-based syndicated columnist Marianne Means.Elaine Woo, \\"James J. Kilpatrick dies at 89; newspaper columnist and arbiter of language\\", Los Angeles Times, August 17, 2010.\\"Remembering James J. Kilpatrick, conservative columnist who died last night\\", Houston Chronicle, August 16, 2010. ==Career and segregationism== Upon graduation, Kilpatrick moved to Richmond, Virginia and began working for Douglas Southall Freeman, Pulitzer-prize winning author of biographies of General Robert E. Lee and editor of The Richmond News Leader. In 1950, Kilpatrick succeeded Freeman as the daily newspaper's editor. For several years after World War II, Kilpatrick championed the case of Silas Rogers, a young black shoeshine man wrongfully convicted of killing police officer R. B. Hatchell in 1943, and ultimately pardoned as a result of Kilpatrick's research and advocacy. A decade later, Kilpatrick received a courage and justice award from a black newspaper for his reporting in that case. However, the following year, Kilpatrick aligned himself with the Byrd Organization and became one of the leading advocates of continued racial segregation during the Civil Rights Movement. Kilpatrick opposed federal involvement into state-enforced racial segregation, and later opposed enforcement of civil rights legislation. After the 1954 and 1955 Supreme Court decisions in Brown v. Board of Education and related cases, Kilpatrick devised \\"state's rights\\" and other rationales which helped convince Virginia's U.S. Senator, Harry Byrd, to advocate the Massive resistance strategy in Virginia and claim leadership of the anti-integration movement throughout the South. In particular, Kilpatrick reformulated the states' rights doctrine of interposition, arguing that individual states had the right to oppose and even nullify federal court rulings.Angei Maxwell, The Indicted South: Public Criticism, Southern Inferiority, and the Politics of Whiteness (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2014), 225.http://www.lva.virginia.gov/exhibits/brown/resistance.htm In November 1960, Kilpatrick participated in a television debate about segregation with Martin Luther King Jr. in New York. Kilpatrick was appointed vice-chairman of the Virginia Commission on Constitutional Government led by attorney David J. Mays. In 1963, Kilpatrick published an analysis of the post-Civil War Civil Rights Cases and two pamphlets: \\"Civil Rights and Legal Wrongs,\\" attacking the Civil Rights Act proposed by President Kennedy, and \\"Civil Rights and Federal Wrongs,\\" attacking expansion of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.James R. Sweeney, \\"Postscript to Massive Resistance: The Decline and Fall of the Virginia Commission on Constitutional Government,\\" Virginia Magazine of History and Biography, 121 No. 1 (2013): 44–76. His arguments for segregation were not entirely based on federalism. In 1963, Kilpatrick submitted an article to The Saturday Evening Post, \\"The Hell He Is Equal\\" in which he wrote that the \\"Negro race, as a race, is in fact an inferior race.\\" (The magazine's editors rejected the article after the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing killed four black schoolgirls.) Kilpatrick eventually changed his position on segregation, though he remained a staunch opponent of federal encroachments on the states.Richard Goldstein, \\"James. J. Kilpatrick, Conservative Voice in Print and on TV, Dies at 89\\", The New York Times, August 16, 2010. Kilpatrick told a Roanoke newspaper in 1993 that he had intended merely to delay court-mandated integration because \\"violence was right under the city waiting to break loose. Probably, looking back, I should have had better consciousness of the immorality, the absolute evil of segregation.\\" As editor of The Richmond News Leader, Kilpatrick also began the Beadle Bumble fund to pay fines for victims of what he termed \\"despots on the bench.\\" He built the fund with contributions from readers and later used the Beadle Bumble Fund to defend books as well as people. After a school board in suburban Richmond ordered school libraries to dispose of all copies of Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird, because the board found the book immoral, Kilpatrick wrote, \\"A more moral novel scarcely could be imagined.\\" With money from the fund, Kilpatrick offered free copies to children who wrote him; by the end of the first week, he had given away 81 copies.\\"Newspapers: Spoofing the Despots\\" Time, Time. January 21, 1966. ==Columnist and author== Kilpatrick began writing his syndicated political column, \\"A Conservative View,\\" in 1964 and left the News Leader in 1966.Nafeesa Syeed, \\"Conservative commentator James J. Kilpatrick remembered\\", AP in Tulsa World, August 17, 2010. In 1979 Kilpatrick joined the Universal Press Syndicate as a columnist, eventually distributed to more than 180 newspapers around the country. Kilpatrick lived in Rappahannock County, Virginia and made the byline of his columns, \\"Scrabble, Virginia\\" as more engaging than his actual postal address in Woodville, Virginia. Kilpatrick entered semi-retirement in 1993, shifting from a three-times-a-week political column to a weekly column on judicial issues, \\"Covering the Courts,\\" which ended in 2008. For many years, Kilpatrick also wrote a syndicated column dealing with English usage, especially in writing, called \\"The Writer's Art\\" (also the title of his 1985 book on writing). In January 2009, the Universal Syndicate announced that Kilpatrick would end this column owing to health reasons. His other books include The Foxes Union, a recollection of his life in Rappahannock County, Virginia, in the Blue Ridge Mountains; Fine Print: Reflections on the Writing Art; and, A Political Bestiary, which he co-wrote with former U.S. Senator Eugene McCarthy and Pulitzer Prize-winning editorial cartoonist Jeff MacNelly. ==Television== Kilpatrick became best known for his nine years as a participant on the TV news magazine 60 Minutes. In the 1970s, he appeared in a closing segment called \\"Point-Counterpoint,\\" opposite Nicholas von Hoffman and, later, Shana Alexander. \\"'If ever I heard an oversimplified fairy tale of the last years in Vietnam, I just heard one from you,' Mr. Kilpatrick said in one exchange. They peppered their remarks with 'Oh, come on, Jack' and 'Now see here, Shana' and helped make possible even-more combative talk shows, including Crossfire.\\" The debates between Kilpatrick and Alexander were such a feature of contemporary American culture that they were satirized on Saturday Night Live, with Jane Curtin taking Alexander's role on \\"Weekend Update\\" opposite Dan Aykroyd's version of Kilpatrick,Legacy.utsandiego.com and in the film Airplane! with actor William Tregoe portraying the faux Kilpatrick. ==Death== Kilpatrick died at George Washington University Hospital in Washington, D.C., and was survived by his second wife, sons, four stepchildren and many grandchildren. His personal papers, including his editorial files and correspondence, are housed in Special Collections of the University of Virginia Library. Guides and descriptions of Kilpatrick's papers are available through the Virginia Heritage database. ==Works== * The Sovereign States: Notes of a Citizen of Virginia.

They are common and may be benign, presenting in around 10–15% of healthy adults and young children. However, having more than three spider angiomas is likely to be abnormal and may be a sign of liver disease. It also suggests the probability of esophageal varices. ==Signs and symptoms== thumbSpider nevus. In the center of the red lesion a small (1 mm) red papule is visible, surrounded by several distinct radiating vessels. Pressure on the lesion causes it to disappear. Blanching is replaced by rapid refill from the central arteriole when pressure is released. Multiple spider angiomata Spider angiomas are found only in the distribution of the superior vena cava, and are thus commonly found on the face, neck, upper part of the trunk, and arms. They may also be present on the backs of the hands and fingers in young children. ==Cause== Spider angiomas form due to failure of the sphincteric muscle surrounding a cutaneous arteriole. The central red dot is the dilated arteriole and the red \\"spider legs\\" are small capillaries carrying away the freely flowing blood. If momentary pressure is applied, it is possible to see the emptied capillaries refilling from the center. No other angiomas show this phenomenon.McCluskey D R Journal of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh 2004, 34: 104 - 105 The dilation, in turn, is caused by increased estrogen levels in the blood. Many pregnant women and women using hormonal contraception have spider angiomas, which is due to high estrogen levels in their blood. Individuals with significant liver disease also show many spider angiomas, as their liver cannot metabolize circulating estrogens, specifically estrone, which derives from the androgen androstenedione. About 33% of patients with cirrhosis have spider angiomas. ==Diagnosis== Diagnosis is by clinical examination. Spider naevi are most commonly seen by general practitioners, or dermatologists. Whilst a lesion can be identified as a spider naevus, this is not a diagnosis in itself. The clinical picture should be indicative of whether there is underlying disease that should be investigated. ==Treatment== Spider angiomas are asymptomatic and usually resolve spontaneously. This is common in the case of children, although they may take several years to disappear. If the spider angiomas are associated with pregnancy, they may resolve after childbirth. In women taking oral contraceptives, they may resolve after stopping these contraceptives. The spider angiomas associated with liver disease may resolve when liver function increases or when a liver transplant is performed. For spider angiomas on the face, techniques such as electrodesiccation and laser treatment can be used to remove the lesion. There is a small risk of a scar, however it usually leaves nothing. Spider angiomas can recur after treatment. == See also == * List of cutaneous conditions ==References== == External links == Category:Dermal and subcutaneous growths Category:Diseases of arteries, arterioles and capillaries ","title":"Spider angioma"},{"id":"3238976","text":"BAE Systems Maritime - Submarines' 25,000m² Devonshire Dock Hall indoor shipbuilding complex, the largest of its kind in Europe.

It was established in 1886 to service a new goldfield at Halls Creek, and it is now a port and service centre for the east Kimberley with a population of 780. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people make up 54% of the population. Wyndham comprises two areas - the original town site at Wyndham Port situated on Cambridge Gulf, and by road to the south, the Three Mile area with the residential and shopping area for the port, also founded in 1886. Wyndham is part of the Shire of Wyndham-East Kimberley. ==History== Wyndham Port from the air, 1962 Wyndham is within traditional Doolboong country. The first European to visit the area was Phillip Parker King in 1819. He was instructed to find a river 'likely to lead to an interior navigation into the great continent'. He sailed into Cambridge Gulf, which he named after the Duke of Cambridge, and then sailed up a river which was subsequently named after him. Finding no fresh water on the mudflats, he departed. Wyndham was established on 14 April 1886, by Government Resident and Warden Charles Danvers Price, who led a party including Commissioner of Crown Lands John Forrest on the Adelaide Steamship Company mail steamer SS Albany. Government Resident Price selected Wyndham as the name for the new town, after Walter George Wyndham, the young stepson of the Governor of Western Australia Sir Frederick Napier Broome. By late-1886, the town was booming and there were three hotels at the port, one of which was a two-storey building, and two taverns at Three Mile Camp, as well as stores, bootmakers' and butchers' shops, a billiard room, a soda water factory, commission agencies, auctioneers and other businesses. Ships brought in at least five thousand miners who headed off to the Halls Creek goldfields. It is known that during this boom there were times when up to 16 vessels were moored in Cambridge Gulf. However, by 1888, the gold rush at Halls Creek had ended and the fortunes of Wyndham declined. Wyndham became a tiny settlement serving the pastoral interests in the East Kimberley. By 1912, money had virtually disappeared from the Wyndham economy, and purchases were paid for using promissory notes known as \\"shinplasters\\". In 1942 during World War II, the town and its aerodrome were attacked on four occasions by Japanese aircraft. Wyndham's significance as a service centre was crucial for the construction of the Ord River Diversion Dam and the town of Kununurra in the early 1960s. With the rise of Kununurra as a larger population centre the significance of Wyndham as a service centre had diminished by the 1980s. Wyndham has regained significance as the port for the region with new mines shipping ore from the port. ==Wyndham Meatworks== In 1913, the Western Australian government started to construct the Wyndham Meatworks to restart the town's economy. The construction efforts were interrupted by the Nevanas affair and World War I, but the meatworks were completed in 1919 to a design by William Hardwick who later became the Principal Architect of Western Australia. The meatworks were the mainstay of the town's economy until their closure in 1985; the town also supported the Air Beef Scheme which ran from 1947 to 1965. ==Geography== Wyndham is on the eastern side of Cambridge Gulf, an inlet of Joseph Bonaparte Gulf in the Timor Sea. It is surrounded by the Durack, Pentecost and King rivers to the south, Forrest River to the west and Ord River to the north. Much of the land around Wyndham is inhospitable, and includes the Bastion Range and the mudflats of the Cambridge Gulf. The Bastion Range is the site of the Wyndham Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International because it holds the largest known population of endangered Gouldian finches.BirdLife International.

The word Katzenjammer is German, meaning \\"discordant sound\\" and is also sometimes used to indicate a general state of depression or bewilderment. It's sometimes used in reference to a hangover. The literal translation is \\"cat's wail\\".Katzenjammer PONS Online Dictionary The duo changed its name in February 2011 to Worbey & Farrell. Worbey and Farrell are a four hands, one piano cabaret act that have performed throughout the UK and Europe in hundreds of theatres and festivals. They have appeared numerous times on television in the UK, Portugal, Germany and Austria. They are regulars on BBC Radio, in particular BBC Radio 3. Their 2015 show Worbey and Farrell's House Party at the Assembly Rooms, Edinburgh was named amongst the top ten shows to see by Time Out (out of 3,300 shows at the Edinburgh Festival). They were one of the few headline acts to perform on the maiden voyages of all three Cunard liners – Queen Mary 2, Queen Elizabeth and Queen Victoria. Worbey and Farrell are Steinway Artists. Their shows feature a wide range of music presented in a comedic manner and include a TV screen where the audience can see the choreography of their hands and their technical showmanship. Their original arrangements cover a myriad of styles including classical, jazz, boogie woogie, pop, rap and showtunes. Some of their comedic routines have been compared to the likes of Victor Borge. ==History== The pair met whilst studying at the Royal College of Music. Although pursuing separate careers, they met regularly to rehearse for a year and the act came together, fusing their personalities and skills. As Steven reflects, \\"It just clicked – the humour, the synchronisation, the improvised sense of fun. We discovered that we played the piano together in a way that had never been played before.

When Airbus was incorporated as a joint-stock company in 2001, BAE Systems transferred its UK Airbus facilities in return for a 20% share of the new company. These facilities became Airbus UK. The company has two main sites responsible for the design and manufacture of the high- technology wings for all Airbus models as well as overall design and supply of the fuel system. For most Airbus models, the company is responsible for overall design and supply of landing gear. The company employs around 13,000 people at two sites: Filton, where the engineering and design activity takes place along with some manufacturing, and Broughton, where other major wing component manufacturing and all wing assembly takes place. ==History== Airbus UK (Filton) Hawker Siddeley (which merged with British Aircraft Corporation (BAC) in 1977 to form British Aerospace) was part of the first Airbus project, the Airbus A300. The British government withdrew support in 1969 but Hawker Siddeley was allowed to continue as supplier of the aircraft's wings due to the advanced stages of design and the reluctance of other nations to take over the wing design. In 1979 BAe rejoined the Airbus consortium. In 2001 Airbus Industries became Airbus S.A.S., the Airbus Integrated Company. Airbus UK started work on the wings for the Airbus A380 in August 2002.http://www.ingenia.org.uk/ingenia/articles.aspx?Index=436 Engineering the A380 wings, Ingenia March 2007 In April 2006 BAE Systems announced its intention to sell its share of Airbus SAS to EADS.\\"BAE Systems to sell Airbus stake.\\" BBC News. 6 April 2006.

However, due to the slow pace of negotiations and disagreements over price, BAE exercised its put option which saw investment bank Rothschild appointed to give an independent valuation. On 2 July 2006 Rothschild valued BAE's stake at £1.9 billion (€2.75 billion); well below the expectation of BAE, analysts and even EADS.\\"BAE under pressure to hold Airbus stake\\" The Guardian Retrieved 3 July 2006 On 5 July 2006 BAE appointed independent auditors to study why the value of its share of Airbus had fallen from the original estimates to the Rothschild valuation.

On 4 October shareholders voted in favour of the sale. ==Sites== Airbus wing design and production was assigned to UK largely because of the advanced wing design of Hawker Siddeley Trident (D.H.121), designed by De Havilland. In the early days of Airbus, De Havilland design teams based in Hatfield worked on Airbus wing design and wing assembly was carried out in Broughton (a De Havilland manufacturing site). After Hawker Siddeley (the parent company of De Havilland) had become part of British Aerospace, the Hatfield site was closed. From the 1990s onwards, Airbus design work has been carried out at the Filton site, which was originally the Bristol Aeroplane Company. ===Filton=== The Filton site is located on the former Bristol Aeroplane Company site, which was later used as the final assembly line for the British-built Concorde aircraft (the French-built Concordes were assembled in Toulouse, which is also now an Airbus site). Airbus Filton employs over 4,500 people in a variety of roles. The site is responsible for the design of the wing structure, fuel systems and landing gear integration. Some manufacturing also takes place in Filton, including the wing assembly for the A400M. Aerodynamics work, research and testing is also carried out. In 2008, Airbus sold most of the component manufacturing activities on the Filton site to GKN, which continues to use these facilities to manufacture Airbus parts as a subcontractor. In 2011 Airbus announced the construction of a new office complex, referred to as the \\"Aerospace Park\\", at the Filton site. ===Broughton=== The current Airbus Broughton site was founded in 1939 as a shadow factory for the production of the Vickers Wellington and the Avro Lancaster. After the War De Havilland took over the factory and it was used to produce various aircraft, including the Mosquito and the Comet. Today Airbus Broughton employs over 6,500 people, mostly in manufacturing roles. The site is responsible for the wing assembly for all Airbus aircraft, with the exception of the Chinese A320s (these wings are assembled in China) and the A400M (assembled in Filton). Airbus wings are transported by Airbus Beluga or ship (in the case of the A380) to the final assembly lines at Airbus Toulouse. ==Aircraft== *Airbus A300 (production ceased) *Airbus A310 (production ceased) *Airbus A310 MRTT *Airbus A320 family *Airbus A330 *Airbus A330 MRTT *Airbus A340 (production ceased) *Airbus A350 *Airbus A380 *Airbus A400M *Airbus Beluga ==See also== *Airbus UK F.C., an Airbus UK football club based in Wales. ==References== Category:Airbus subsidiaries and divisions Category:Aerospace companies of the United Kingdom Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1997 Category:British brands Category:Manufacturing companies of the United Kingdom Category:1997 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:British subsidiaries of foreign companies ","title":"Airbus UK"},{"id":"3239038","text":"Moorby is a small village in the East Lindsey district of Lincolnshire, England. The village is situated south-east from Horncastle and east from Wood Enderby. The village is in the civil parish of Claxby with Moorby, where Claxby refers to Claxby Pluckacre. Moorby has a population of about 50 inhabitants. At the 2011 census the population remained less than 100 and in included in the civil parish of Wood Enderby. ==History== According to Mills, Moorby derives from the Old Norse for 'mór' plus 'bý', a \\"farmstead or village in the moor\\".Mills, Anthony David (2003); A Dictionary of British Place Names, p. 333, Oxford University Press, revised edition (2011). Moorby is listed in the 1086 Domesday Book as \\"Morebi\\", in the Horncastle Hundred of Lindsey South Riding. The village contained 18 households, 10 smallholders, 8 freemen, a meadow of , woodland of , and a church. In 1066 Queen Edith held the Lordship, which in 1086 was transferred to William I as Lord of the Manor and Tenant-in- chief. In 1885 Kelly's noted Moorby as a village with a Wesleyan chapel, and a school, founded 1856, for children of the parishes of Moorby, Wilksby, Claxby Pluckacre, and Wood Enderby. The school was supported by voluntary contributions and held 70 pupils, with an average attendance of 40. Parish soil was described as heavy loam with a subsoil of white clay, on which were grown wheat, barley, seeds and turnips. Parish population in 1881 was 98. Moorby occupations included four farmers, a wheelwright who was also a beer retailer, a blacksmith, and a farm bailiff.Kelly's Directory of Lincolnshire with the port of Hull 1885, pp. 582,583 A church, dedicated to All Saints, was demolished in the 1980s Kelly's (1885) notes the church as a small structure in Early English style, constructed of Ancaster stone with brick bands, and comprising a chancel, nave and vestry, a north porch, and a small square tower with one bell and a spire. The arcade was of three arches, the reredos of carved stone and encaustic tile, and the pulpit of Caen stone. The parish registers dated from 1561, and included those of Claxby Pluckacre. The living was a rectory and of glebe land at Wildmoor Fen. The Shell Guide to Lincolnshire describes Moorby church as being \\"much restored by James Fowler in 1866, but he left a large and very early font\\". In 1964 Pevsner noted a square font that included images of a virgin, sun and moon, kneeling and seated figures, a cadaver, and an angel. The vestry held a 16th-century stone panel with the image of a man playing bagpipes and two dancing figures. A 1712 paten by John Stocker also existed.Pevsner, Nikolaus; Harris, John; The Buildings of England: Lincolnshire pp. 317, 318; Penguin, (1964); revised by Nicholas Antram in 1989, Yale University Press. Moorby was 'a Great War landing ground' for the RAF.\\"Moorby\\", Genuki.org.uk The village contains remains of POW Camp 79. The camp was a standard Second World War working camp for German soldiers.

The first phase was opened in 2011 with the second phase opened in mid-2012; these two phases are officially known as the A728 Clyde Gateway. A third phase from the Parkhead Bypass to Provan (M8/M80) is scheduled for construction in 2018. ==History== The history of the route goes back to the Glasgow Inner Ring Road (IRR) project of the 1960s. Owing largely to public opposition, only the northern and western flanks of this were ever built (what is now the central section of the M8). With the resultant chronic traffic congestion on the M8, only recently has the southern flank, the M74 Completion, finally opened after much local opposition. The construction of the EERR link will provide an 'inner circle' connecting the new section of M74 at Polmadie Road with the M8 at Provan. ==Route== The route of the EERR was planned as early as 1965 by the then Glasgow Corporation after the Glasgow Inner Ring Road proposals originating from the Bruce Report, and was originally a continuation of the Stirling Motorway (which would be realised as the M80) which would have run directly south beyond the interchange with the Monkland Motorway (the present-day M8) at Provan Gas Works. This road would have driven south towards the extended South Link Motorway (now the M74) and would have served as an \\"outer ring\\" for the city. As the appetite for further inner urban motorway developments waned in the 1970s following the backlash when the city centre section of the IRR was built in the late 1960s, the route evolved into an urban thoroughfare instead. The M80, when eventually built in the early 1990s, now terminated at the Provan Gas Works interchange, whilst the Parkhead bypass, constructed in 1988 as part of the Parkhead Forge shopping development, was effectively the first section of the EERR. From Parkhead, the road would cut northward, through Hogarth Park, a former railway embankment now used as public open space. The new road would run between Haghill and Carntyne, under Edinburgh Road and Cumbernauld Road continuing along the old Caledonian Railway \\"Switchback\\" line to the M8/M80 junction at Provan. A planning application was submitted for the southern section of the EERR, named the Clyde Gateway, in October 2005, but the winning of Host City for the 2014 Commonwealth Games provided the necessary impetus. Phase 1, from junction 1A of the now-completed M74 extension Polmadie Road to Shawfield opened in April 2007 as part of the Oatlands development. Phase 2 was completed in April 2012 and designated as the A728. It passes Shawfield Stadium, over the River Clyde at Rutherglen Bridge and past Dalmarnock railway station (where it meets the A749), before linking up with the Parkhead bypass (A74) and the new stadia district (Celtic Park and the Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome), joining the existing road network at the Forge Retail Park. ==Progress== Construction of phase 3, linking north from the A89 Parkhead Bypass to the M8 at Provan along a disused railway line, was planned to commence after the 2014 Commonwealth Games. In January 2016, Glasgow City Council approved the construction of this phase with works expected to start in 2018 and complete in 2021 at an estimated cost of £60 million.Final phase of £60m Glasgow carriageway set for approval, Scottish Construction Now, 18 January 2016 ==References== ==External links== *Information page from Glasgow City Council * Clyde Waterfront project details of M74 - M8 interchange Category:Roads in Scotland Category:Transport in Glasgow Category:Proposed roads in the United Kingdom Category:Proposed transport infrastructure in Scotland Category:Bridgeton–Calton–Dalmarnock Category:Parkhead ","title":"Glasgow East End Regeneration Route"},{"id":"3239046","text":"BAE Systems Integrated System Technologies (known informally as Insyte) was a division of BAE Systems plc.

It has the largest skiable glacier in Europe and is France's second oldest ski resort behind Chamonix, where the largest mountain in western Europe is located, Mont Blanc. It has the longest, normally open full on-piste vertical available in the world. It is a drive southeast of Grenoble. ==Resort== The \\"two Alps\\" in the name do not refer to the two facing mountain- sides that comprise the resort, but rather to two adjacent areas of the original mountain pasture on the north-south plateau on which the resort was built. These pasture areas (or 'alps') are part of the two villages of Mont- de-Lans and Vénosc that lie in the deep valleys, respectively, to the north and south. Access to the resort is by road RD 1091, in Livet-et-Gavet - no road connects the resort to Vénosc down the steep slope to the south, but a gondola connects the two, and there is a footpath passable in summer. ==Winter== Les Deux Alpes offers approximately of posted runs and of vertical drop. In terms of pistes the resort has been termed \\"upside-down\\", as the lower slopes down to the resort are steeper and more challenging than the higher ski areas, including the wide and forgiving glacier runs. Less advanced skiers either take a gondola down to the resort or follow a lengthy, gentle but narrow, track on the path of the access road. In winter 2015/2016 a new run made an intermediate route to the resort available, an effort involving the movement of over 550,000 cubic meters of earth. A wide area at the very bottom by the town is given over to nursery slopes. In total there are 100 marked runs spread across the resort however, in addition, it is said to have as much off piste as groomed piste. Les Deux Alpes also boasts one of the most extensive and revered snowparks in Europe, with a halfpipe, multiple kickers, two boardercross courses and many grinding rails. The snowpark is re-modelled with new features added each season. A view of the glacier's ski-lift system The Dôme de la Lauze ===Lifts=== The lift system has a combined up hill capacity of 66,000 people per hour. In total there are 59 lifts serving the resort. At peak times lift queues can be very long, and it can take over an hour to travel from the village to the top of the glacier, which is sometimes closed due to blizzards, high winds, avalanche risks, or a combination of both. The resort of La Grave can be accessed from the very top lift at the Dome de la Lauze by either walking or at certain times by ski-tow behind a Snowcat. It is only recommended for advanced skiers under supervision of a qualified guide. As part of the planned 350M Euro investment in Alpe d'Huez over the next 5 years, a new lift connecting the two resorts is targeted for completion on 2021, creating one of the biggest linked ski areas in the world. ===Ticketing=== A part of the Grande Galaxie area of un-linked ski resorts including Alpe d'Huez, La Grave, Puy Saint Vincent and Vaujany which offer limited sharing of ski-passes. A six-day ski pass includes two days in Alpe d'Huez and one in Serre Chevalier. Ski passes in the resort can now be used hands free. ===Glacier=== The glacier enables year-round skiing (although the lifts are only open from mid-June to the end of August in Summer and December to end of April in Winter with some dates in October too). A funicular railway tunnelled under the ice transports skiers and, in summer, tourists to , from where panoramic views can be seen of the surroundings, including Mont Blanc, some distant, L'Alpe d'Huez and the Plateau de Vercors above Grenoble. ==Summer== In summer, Les Deux Alpes becomes a popular venue for downhill and freeride mountain biking, with access to the glacier via the Jandri Express gondola lift, with a yearly event named \\"Mountain Of Hell\\". This opens up a vertical mile of trails down to the resort and an even bigger drop to the Barrage du Chambon. Les Deux Alpes has featured in several Tour De France stages most notably a Marco Pantani stage victory in 1998, from which he went on to win the tour that year. Some mountain bikers take the 15 km unpaved road, which leads from Les Deux Alpes all the way up to the ski resort, thereby being the highest mountain road in the Alps. The altitude difference of 1550 m, several very steep passages, as well as the coarse gravel on the road make this a very demanding trip. Les Deux Alpes also has the largest skiable glacier in Europe. Summer skiing in Les 2 Alpes takes place between and on the Girose and Mont de Lans glaciers above the resort.

The game takes place between the events of The House of the Dead 2 and The House of the Dead III, and introduced several new gameplay concepts. Players can control characters James Taylor, from The House of the Dead 2 (on the left side), or Kate Green, a new character to the series (on the right side). The game was followed by House of the Dead: Scarlet Dawn. The House of the Dead 4 is the first game to run on the Sega Lindbergh arcade system board. A PlayStation 3 version featuring support for PlayStation Move and the two stages from The House of the Dead 4 Special was released on April 17, 2012 on the PlayStation Network. ==Gameplay== The player can reload the gun by shaking it, or by just pointing off the screen. The game also features grenades that the player can throw to destroy large numbers of enemies. Additional grenades can be earned by completing certain tasks or by shooting crates. At some points in the game, players are required to shake the gun vigorously in order to escape certain situations. The game features branching paths. Most of the paths lead to the same point in the game's story. As with The House of the Dead III, there is an end-of-stage bonus where players can receive extra lives depending on headshot level combo, accuracy, and score. Another returning factor is the presence of the \\"Cancel\\" bar. The game runs on a critical shots counter where the player is encouraged to shoot the enemy's weak points rather than spraying ammo at the enemy. It starts off as Good, Excellent, Amazing and then Perfect. Getting hit, or killing an enemy not by the weak point resets the counter. The most common enemies have three attacks. A \\"normal attack\\", a \\"grab,\\" and a \\"push\\". The foremost inflicts one point of damage, while the second forces a shaking sequence that, if successful, pushes back attackers for easier disposal, but if unsuccessful, will result in the player being bitten or the player's character being knocked down and vulnerable. Multiple zombies may also pile on top of both players in an attempt to stomp on them (or kick them while they're down). There are also a number of secrets in the game. Different hidden treasures, such as coins and golden shapes, which increase the player's score, as well as \\"lives\\", etc. can be found by interacting with the game's environments. The bonus-life system departs from the previous games, where life is gained by saving hostages; the loss of these events are substituted with an increase of extra-life pickups in the environment. There are also \\"treasure rooms\\" that can be accessed using different techniques (such as shooting a certain spot or throwing a grenade in a certain area), which contain multiple items that can be obtained at once within a limited time. ==Plot== In 2003, three years after the Goldman Case, veteran American AMS agent James Taylor, and a new rookie agent, Kate Green, are gathering intelligence at the fifth basement floor of the European headquarters of the AMS in Italy (London in the Japanese dub). James has a sharp memory of the 2000 \\"Goldman Case\\", and believes that the ordeal has not yet ended. A sudden earthquake rocks the room while they talk, collapsing the basement walls and leaving the agents trapped. Several days later, as the two await a rescue team, James' PDA goes off, and a group of undead are seen on the security cameras. Realizing that they are in danger, James has Kate gather all the weaponry they can find to defend themselves. Soon after, the two travel through the sewers to an information room where they uncover a plot to fire nuclear missiles worldwide within 24 hours' time, facing the four-armed giant zombie Justice and a pair of mutant tarantulas known as The Lovers along the way. Taking the subway into zombie-infested streets from an underground shopping district, the agents narrowly avoid attacks by The Empress, a double- ended chainsaw-wielding assassin, and the massive, obese, and nearly impervious Temperance. James and Kate then learn that the late one-time CEO of the now-defunct DBR Corporation, Goldman, is responsible for the resurgence of undead. All of his messages and current plans were set in motion even before his death. Upon reaching the surface, they find the city completely obliterated. Goldman sends them a PDA message indicating that the launch will occur in one hour. The agents head for the abandoned Goldman Building and upon arrival, a levitating humanoid named The Star, confronts them in the foyer. After the Star is defeated, the duo arrive in time to halt the missile launch, though it is revealed that Goldman's true intention is to revert humankind to its original state in order to prevent them from harming the planet further. As such, his final legacy, The World, an insectoid humanoid with powers over ice, is released in the opening of \\"Pandora's Box\\" to fulfill its role as the successor to his original Emperor project in 2000, having developed underground since his death. As the AMS agents fight it, the World continuously evolves to become larger and more powerful. Following the World's second defeat, James sets his PDA to self-destruct and, telling Kate not to give up hope, sacrifices himself to destroy the World in the ensuing explosion. A shaken and distraught Kate walks out of Goldman's premises. ===Endings=== The game has four endings available depending on the player's performance result during the game, which at the end of either endings, the screen displays \\"The story continues in The House of the Dead III\\". * Standard Ending: A view of Goldman's computer playing a recording of him saying that \\"the human race has not been eliminated\\", instructing to \\"travel north\\" while musing that \\"hope is such a splendid thing\\" as he leaves the room. * Bad Ending: The ending plays out the same as the standard ending but the camera pans on Goldman's face showing him changing into a zombie. * \\"G\\" Ending: G appears outside the Goldman building, and states that the zombie crisis has not yet ended while telling James to rest in peace and he will assist the heroes to face what awaits. This ending has G in his House of the Dead III appearance, suggesting to have took place after The House of the Dead 4 Special and right before the events of The House of The Dead III, as the game suggests the story continues in The House of The Dead III. * Mystery Man Ending: The unnamed mysterious man previously seen in one of The House of the Dead III's ending, sits in his study, declaring Goldman to be soft and that humans have no need of hope, before stating that the true end shall soon begin and that there is more than one Pandora's Box. ==Development== ===Video display=== The House of the Dead 4 was the first arcade light gun game to feature a high-definition widescreen display. The different displays used for each of the models are as follows: Mitsubishi's 2005 62\\" rear-projection DLP 16:9 ratio widescreen model for the \\"Super Deluxe\\" cabinet (although later models of the game would use Toshiba, Zenith, and LG rear-projections), LG's 2005 52\\" rear-projection DLP 4:3 ratio model for the \\"Deluxe\\"-sized cabinet, and Sanwa or Nanao color monitor 29\\" CRT 4:3 ratio television for the \\"upright\\" cabinet (although it is a CRT set and can only accept a 480i signal, it has a high screen resolution of 676 dots by 625 lines). The game runs in 1080i on the Deluxe and Super Deluxe cabinets and in 480i on the standard cabinet. The video signal is connected via a DVI to HDMI adapter for the Super Deluxe cabinet, VGA for the Deluxe cabinet, and S-Video for the Standard cabinet. ==The House of the Dead 4 Special== The House of the Dead 4 Special flyer, showing the theater unit and the seat The House of the Dead 4 Special is a two-player attraction based on The House of the Dead 4. The game makes use of two 100-inch screens, one in front of the players and another behind, as well as a five-speaker sound system, giving the impression that enemies are attacking from all directions. The seat shakes when zombies attack, and players are blasted with air whenever they take damage. The seat automatically rotates to face the players towards whichever screen zombies are attacking from. The game also features a new addition of a life bar. As the players are hit the life bar diminishes. If the life bar is reduced to zero the game is over. There are no continues. The PlayStation 3 port of The House of the Dead 4 Special is unlocked by completing The House of the Dead 4 for the first time. However, it uses lives rather than the life bar and allow players to continue. This game features a side story in The House of the Dead plotline, taking place shortly after The House of the Dead 4, with Kate Green teaming up with Agent \\"G\\" to destroy the zombie infestation at its source, leading them to confront the Magician, a boss character who returns after having been obliterated in the first two installments. This game only features two bosses, Justice (Type 0053) and The Magician (Type 0), whom \\"G\\" and Kate encounter in a room of a building (which \\"G\\" believes it to be the source of the zombie infestation, and the building's interior is similar to the EFI research facility in The House of the Dead III). In the end, players have to blast a button with a grenade. In a two-player game, players are judged on how compatible they are based on performance alone. In America, there are currently no locations that this version of the game can be seen: The machine at GameWorks in Schaumburg, Illinois, was retired due to constant breakdowns, while the machine that is seen GameWorks in Las Vegas, Nevada, has since been sold to a private collector. This game has also been spotted in Europe, Japan, Brazil, Russia, Dubai, the Macau Fisherman's Wharf, and in Hong Kong Mega Box. === Endings === The game has two endings available depending on whether the players blast the button and on the player's performance result during the game. * \\"Bad Ending\\": The button itself will activate The Magician's clones if it's not blasted with the grenade, and the players receive a \\"bad ending\\". * Standard Ending: The Magician will once again be destroyed in a massive explosion, as he says \\"Nothing can erase my pain\\". Performing well throughout the game will unlock an extra scene where the Mystery Man limps into the room, proclaims that Pandora's box has been closed, but ponders if there is any hope left for the humans, remarking that \\"the Wheel of Fate cannot be stopped\\" alluding to The House of the Dead III. ==Reception== The original arcade game received positive reviews when it was released. In July 2005, IGN said it \\"may be the most visually impressive arcade game ever made,\\" noting the improved lighting and the zombie and environmental details. They also praised the gameplay, including the increased number of zombies on screen, \\"intense\\" experience, boss battles, the use of machine guns, and the light gun's new shaking detection feature. The same month, 1UP praised the \\"next-gen visuals\\" and the improvements to the gameplay, such as the new \\"shaking\\" gameplay mechanic and the \\"hordes of zombies on screen at once.\\"http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage%3FcId%3D3141842 Arcade Belgium praised the arcade game, including the graphics, noting \\"thirty or so enemies at the same time\\" with each \\"very detailed\\" and \\"behaving his own way\\", as well as \\"bump mapping (seen for instance on enemies' visible muscles),\\" complex lightning effects such as reflections, particle effects on impact, \\"fog (in the sewers),\\" high polygon counts for each monster, realistic water, and elaborate scenery. They also praised the gameplay, including the new lighter gun, \\"emergency grenades, new reloading method\\" and the \\"gun shaking\\" trick. They gave it ratings, out of 20, of 17 for addictiveness, 18 for graphics, 16 for sound, and 17 for gameplay, with 17 out of 20 overall. ==References== ==External links== * Sega's official Japanese The House of the Dead 4 page Category:2005 video games Category:Arcade games Category:Sega arcade games Category:Cooperative video games Category:Head-to-head arcade games Category:Light gun games Category:PlayStation Move-compatible games Category:PlayStation Network games Category:Rail shooters Category:The House of the Dead Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games featuring female protagonists Category:Interquel video games Category:Video games set in 2003 Category:Video games set in Italy ","title":"The House of the Dead 4"},{"id":"3239081","text":"John Michael Terence Wellesley Denison (1 November 191522 July 1998)\\"Screen gent Denison dies\\", BBC News, 22 July 1998 was an English actor.

He is noted for his fine portraits, often of important Japanese and foreign figures, and for his excellent landscapes, particularly of Nagasaki and its surroundings. Ueno was a major figure in nineteenth-century Japanese photography as a commercially and artistically successful photographer and as an instructor. ==Background, youth, and preparation== View of boats. Albumen silver print, nineteenth century. Ueno Hikoma's family background perhaps provided an early impetus for his eventual career. A number of family members had been portrait painters. Furthermore, he was the son of Ueno Toshinojō (also known as Ueno Shunnojō) (1790-1851), a merchant in the employ of the Shimazu clan who in 1848 imported possibly the first camera in the country, a daguerreotype camera for the Shimazu daimyō, Nariakira. Ueno Hikoma first studied Chinese classics; then in 1852, not long after his father's death, he entered the Nagasaki Medical College with a view to studying chemistry in order to help him run the family business, dealing in nitre and chintz dyeing. He eventually studied chemistry under the Dutch naval medical officer Johannes L. C. Pompe van Meerdervoort (1829–1908) after the latter's arrival in 1857. Pompe van Meerdervoort, who had a camera and photography manual though little experience as a photographer, also instructed Ueno Hikoma in photography. It was only after his contact with Swiss photographer Pierre Rossier (1829 – ca. 1890) that Ueno decided to pursue a career as a photographer. Rossier had been commissioned by the firm Negretti and Zambra to photograph in Asia and he worked in Japan from 1859 to 1860. He was only in Nagasaki for a short time, but while there he taught wet-collodion process photography to Ueno, Horie Kuwajirō (1831-1866), Maeda Genzō (1831-1906) and others. Soon after, Ueno's friend Horie bought a wet-plate camera. The purchase, which included photographic chemicals, was funded by the daimyō of Tsu Domain, Tōdō Takayuki, and the price was 150 ryō. Apparently the photographic equipment was of such interest to Ueno that he chose to become a subject of the Tsu Domain in order to have access to it at the domainal residence in Edo. and in 1861 Horie photographed Ueno at work in the domain's laboratory in Edo (now Tokyo). In 1862 Ueno and Horie co-wrote a textbook titled that comprised translated extracts from ten Dutch science manuals and which included an appendix titled [The Technique of Photography] that described techniques of collodion process photography as well as Nicéphore Niépce's asphalt printing method. ==Career== Torii and lake. Albumen silver print, between 1860 and 1900. After his time working for the Tsu Domain in Edo, Ueno returned to Nagasaki, but finding that Pompe van Meerdervoort had left the country, he gave up , or the study of Western science. He decided to make a career as a photographer. In the autumn of 1862 Ueno opened a commercial photographic studio by the Nakashima River in Nagasaki and he also began importing cameras. At first the business was unsuccessful, but it gradually grew, allowing the studio to move to a large and well-lit building in 1882, becoming popular with Japanese and foreign notables and receiving mention in guidebooks, in Edmond Cotteau's Un touriste dans l'Extrême-Orient (1884) and in Pierre Loti's novel, Madame Chrysanthème (1887). The patronage of foreigners in turn greatly increased Ueno's income, which allowed him to use more expensive materials and to expand his studios. Still in the early days of this imported technology, Ueno overcame the reticence of many Japanese to be photographed and took portraits of such figures as Sakamoto Ryōma, Itō Shunsuke, Takasugi Shinsaku, and Katsu Kaishū. During their visits to Japan Ueno photographed Ulysses S. Grant in 1879 and the Russian crown prince (later Tsar Nicholas II) in 1891. With the help of such patronage, Ueno's studio operated until the end of the century. Ueno had an important and close working relationship with Felice Beato. When visiting Nagasaki, Beato used Ueno's studio and photographed his younger sister and acquaintances, amongst other residents of the city. Beato also photographed Ueno himself at the Daikōji temple and the two photographers apparently exchanged photographs. Ueno probably refined his technique during his contact with the experienced Beato. Two other foreign visitors to Japan who influenced Ueno were the Dutch photographer Konrad Walter Gratama, who added to Ueno's knowledge of chemistry in 1866, and the Austrian photographer Wilhelm Burger who seems to have taught photographic techniques to Ueno while also making use of Ueno's studio to take some stereographs during his visit to the country in 1869-1870. Statue of Ueno Hikoma in Nagasaki Ueno himself taught many important nineteenth-century photographers, including Uchida Kuichi (1844-1875), Tomishige Rihei, Kameya Tokujirō, (1837-1922), Nakajima Shinzō, Nagai Nagayoshi, Noguchi Jōichi, Nakajima Seimin, Tanaka, Morita Raizō, Kikizu Maturoku, and Ueno Yoshima. Ueno maintained a close relationship with Uchida, and following the latter's trip to Nagasaki in 1872 while photographing for the Emperor Meiji their albums include several identical images that they presumably exchanged. Eventually, Ueno opened branches of his photographic studio in Vladivostok in 1890 and in Shanghai and Hong Kong in 1891. In addition to portraits, Ueno produced many images of Nagasaki and its surroundings. He also photographed the transit of Venus across the sun in 1874 for an American astronomical observation mission. In 1877, the governor of Nagasaki prefecture, Kitajima Hidetomo, commissioned him to take battlefield photographs in southwest Japan during the Satsuma Rebellion. For this commission Ueno was paid ¥330 for 420 prints. He was accompanied on this job by Setsu Shinichi and Noguchi Jōichi. He exhibited photographs in at least two World Expositions, the Vienna World Exposition of 1873 and the World Columbian Exposition of 1893 in Chicago, at which he won an award for “Good Taste and Artistic Finish”. At first Ueno practiced wet-plate photography, but by about 1877 he began using imported Belgian dry plates. In spite of the contemporary popularity of hand-coloured photographs, Ueno's photographs are usually uncoloured. Some of Ueno's negatives were probably purchased at some point by the photographer Kusakabe Kimbei, as these images appear in the latter's albums. Though he apparently did not regularly offer photograph albums, he seems to have made some albums by special request for foreign customers. Ueno considered French and American photographic techniques and materials (for example, paper and lenses) to be superior to those of the British, whose products he also complained were overpriced, noting that albumen paper sold (c. 1868) for 100 ryō per box. Eight of Ueno's photographs can be found online from the Freer Gallery of Art and Arthur M. Sackler Gallery Archives.Search results for Ueno Hikoma , SIRIS, Smithsonian Institution. ==Commemoration== In 2000 the “Kyushu Sangyo University Photo Contest” established the “Ueno Hikoma Award” to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the founding of Kyushu Sangyo University.

Formerly called the Wehrmachtsauskunftstelle (WASt), this agency also provides information about the fate of foreign and German soldiers as well as prisoners of war in Germany. This kind of information is used for civil proceedings as well as an official register of war graves, and for historical research as well as biographical and genealogical purposes.(fr) Laurent Guillet: La WASt. In: Amicale Nationale des Enfants de la Guerre (Editor): Des fleurs sur les cailloux. Editions Laurent Guillet 2010, p. 233. The agency was established on 26 August 1939 and has been an agency of the state government of Berlin since 1951. It is not subject to the Bundesarchivgesetz (Federal Archives Act), and the military records are therefore publicly available 10 years after the death of the concerned person. The agency is a major source for scientific research in various areas. ==History== It started its work on 26 August 1939 under the name of Wehrmachtauskunftstelle für Kriegerverluste und Kriegsgefangene (WASt), as part of the Wehrmacht, under the auspices of Article No. 77 of the Third Geneva Convention (which related to the treatment of prisoners of war from 27 July 1929). The text of Article 77 is as follows: The Detaining Powers shall provide all facilities for the transmission, through the Protecting Power or the Central Prisoners of War Agency provided for in Article 123, of instruments, papers or documents intended for prisoners of war or despatched by them, especially powers of attorney and wills. In all cases they shall facilitate the preparation and execution of such documents on behalf of prisoners of war; in particular, they shall allow them to consult a lawyer and shall take what measures are necessary for the authentication of their signatures. ===Headquarters moved several times=== In August 1943, the archives were divided in two parts. One part of the WASt was transferred to Saalfeld/Saale in Thuringia, the other part moved to Meiningen, also in Thuringia. It was put under American military authority on 12 April 1945, after their occupation of Thuringia. The American forces moved WASt on 1 July 1945 to Fürstenhagen near Kassel, shortly before the Red Army moved in. Laurent Guillet: La WASt. In: Amicale Nationale des Enfants de la Guerre (Editor): Des fleurs sur les cailloux. Editions Laurent Guillet 2010, p. 233. In January 1946, the archive was relocated to Berlin and renamed the Deutsche Dienststelle. On 14 June 1946, the Allied Control Council devolved some of its role to the French Military Commission.Christian Taske: \\"Ich habe gedacht, die spinnen doch.\\" Er bewahrte die persönliche Geschichte Hunderttausender Deutscher: 1946 verwaltete Henry Sternweiler das Archiv der Wehrmacht.

(translated to English: American soldier saved documents Article in einestages.spiegel.de from 4 December 2009 The Federal Government of Germany and Land Berlin agreed on 9 January 1951, to rename WASt the Deutsche Dienststelle (WASt) für die Benachrichtigung der nächsten Angehörigen von Gefallenen der ehemaligen deutschen Wehrmacht and made it part of the administration of Land Berlin. WASt is now located in Berlin in the Wittenau quarter in the district of Reinickendorf. Its address is Eichborndamm 179. ===Data from further archives=== WASt integrated in the post-war period documents from other military and paramilitary archives. In December 1990, it received documents originating from the Potsdam military archive and from the GDR state archive in Dornburg near Zerbst/Anhalt. Laurent Guillet: La WASt. In: Amicale Nationale des Enfants de la Guerre (Editor): Des fleurs sur les cailloux. Editions Laurent Guillet 2010, p. 234. WASts archives were swelled by further documents from various former army, navy/marine and other archives about casualties, prisoners of war and so on. WASt has now also become an important source for scientific research. ==Existing files== The French author Laurent Guillet, a native resident of Brittany, has conducted research into his main interest area of Franco-German history during World War II. He has listed some important documents which are part of the archives of WASt. This information is recorded below to further assist potential users of WASt.(fr) Laurent Guillet: La WASt. In: Amicale Nationale des Enfants de la Guerre (Hrsg.): Des fleurs sur les cailloux. Editions Laurent Guillet 2010, S. 234 - 235. ===Combatants=== * WASt maintain a registry in alphabetical order of more than 18 million military and paramilitary participants of World War II. ===Land and Air Forces=== * It has 100 million personal data records about transfers of World War II soldiers and airmen and their identity discs. * It has five million personal documents, e. g. service record books, from soldiers of land and air forces of World War II. ===Navy/Marines=== * The archive has two million personal files for naval personnel and minesweeping personnel in the period 1871 - 1947. ===War graves=== ===Prisoners of war=== * 15 million personal data files concerning German, Austrian and their allied soldiers, who were captured in the course of World War II by French, American or British troops. There are also discharge documents of prisoners of war coming back from post-war captivity in the Soviet Union. * Another 1.5 million files still existing from foreign soldiers who were captured by German forces. ==Role of the Deutsche Dienststelle (WASt)== Requests directed to WASt will pass through, according to the wishes of the individual, the following stages:(fr) Entretien avec Marie-Cécile Zipperling.

On the other hand, persons who committed war crimes in the German Armed Forces (Wehrmacht), could be identified by this agency. ===Future=== Today, the Agency is called the Deutsche Dienststelle (WASt) and is part of the administration of Bundesland Berlin. Nowadays, enquiries are often still fruitful; for example, the German War Graves Commission relies in its search for unknown German war graves, among others, on information obtained from them. It can also provide proof of German descent for would-be immigrants looking to resettle from abroad (e.g. from Poland), as establishing a link to an ancestor who served in the German Armed Forces can provide this. War children whose fathers were German soldiers or German Prisoners of War can also contact the Agency to research the history of their German fathers who were killed, are listed as missing, or are no longer traceable. Such enquiries to WASt derive mainly from France, Norway, Denmark, The Netherlands, and from Finland. In terms of numbers, there are about 500 enquiries per year from war children born in, or slightly after, World War II, with around 110 per year alone from France. This research is often undertaken as part of a genealogical search for their origins, their unknown procreator and relates to those soldiers who were declared missing, killed in action or are untraceable.(fr) Amitié Nationale des Enfants de la Guerre, Lettre ouverte no 4, Janvier 2009, p. 6 WASt can also conduct inquiries for the German families of former German soldiers, for example, to find out if a French war child is searching for their father.(fr) Entretien avec Marie-Cécile Zipperling.

It was released on October 9, 2001 via Interscope Records. Recording sessions took place at Westlake Recording Studios in Los Angeles, at the Frat House, Down the Hall Studios, 1210 Studios, Mix it in the Mix, and the Dungeon Recording Studio in Atlanta. Production was handled by Shannon Houchins, Timbaland, Khalifani, Organized Noize, and Gerald Hall. It features guest appearances from Timbaland, Backbone, Bohagon, C.I., Duddy Ken, Kosha, Sebastian and Sleepy Brown. The album debuted at number 3 on the Billboard 200 with 132,000 copies sold in the first week released. A couple months later the record was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America with an excess of 500,000 copies sold, making it the most successful of his six full-length albums to date. It includes the hit singles \\"Ugly\\" and \\"Lovely\\". The song \\"Regardless\\" was not an official single but did receive some radio airplay. The song \\"Bubba Talk\\" featured in The Wash (soundtrack). ==Critical reception== Dark Days, Bright Nights received generally positive reviews from music critics who praised both Timbaland and Organized Noize's sharp production and Bubba's loose delivery of Southern-fried tales. Steve 'Flash' Juon of RapReviews gave high praise to the album's production for mixing various genres and showcasing Bubba's countrified lyrics, concluding with, \\"Thanks to partnering with Timbaland, Bubba Sparxxx succeeds where similar artists such as Tow Down and Haystak didn't - but their day will come too. For now, Sparxxx sits alone atop a rap throne representing a kind of po' white rap even Marshall Mathers only WISHES he knew about\\". The Los Angeles Times credited Bubba's energetic flow and lyrics for lifting typical hip-hop tropes into interesting tales, calling it \\"Southern gothic as pulp comic book, unsettling and appealing in equal measure\\". Kitty Empire of NME praised Bubba for basking in his Southern roots with tracks both introspective and upbeat, concluding that \\"Like a country mile, 'Dark Days' is a little long at 19 tracks and 77-plus minutes. But it's crucial to stay the course. Because Bubba talk really is the latest word in hip-hop\\". AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted that Bubba's voice usually gets lost in the production and lacks creativity but said that it still remains a presence throughout the album, due to Timbaland's genre-mixing production matching his energy, concluding that its \\"better than most rap debuts of 2001, not just because of the mastermind of Timbaland, but because Bubba Sparxxx is still a strong focal point, even when he tends to repeat himself\\". David Browne of Entertainment Weekly commended the album for showcasing Bubba's backwoods world with sharp production and authentic tales but felt that it devolved into materialistic brag rap with a production grab bag that's shifty, saying that, \\"Given these ingredients, the potential for a unique, powerful hip-hop statement is considerable. Unfortunately, neither Sparxxx nor his collaborators deliver fully on the promise\\". Maurice Bottomley of PopMatters was critical of Bubba throughout the album, saying that his lyrical skills lack variety in wordplay and imagery but found it workmanlike and honest in its delivery, concluding that \\"Even so, the world hardly needs another average rap album, which, whether you see Sparxxx as mere marketing gimmick or genuine signifier of the New South, I am afraid, is all Dark Days, Bright Nights represents\\". ==Track listing== ;Sample credits *\\"Bubba Talk\\" contains elements from \\"Les Yeux Noirs (Dark Eyes)\\" by Coco Briaval and \\"Pena\\" by Šaban Bajramović *\\"Lovely\\" contains elements from \\"Theme from Shaft\\" by Isaac Hayes *\\"Ugly\\" contains elements from \\"Get Ur Freak On\\" by Missy Elliott ==Personnel== *Warren Anderson Mathis – vocals *Timothy Zachary Mosley – vocals (tracks: 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11), producer & mixing (tracks: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11) *Jemmie \\"KillaGroove\\" Watford – vocals (tracks: 3, 18) *Missy \\"Misdemeanor\\" Elliott – vocals (track 2) *Wes Whitsett – vocals (track 3) *Patrick \\"Sleepy\\" Brown – vocals (track 7) *Jamahr \\"Backbone\\" Williams – vocals (track 7) *Garland Waverly Mosley, Jr. – vocals (track 9) *Ronesha Howard – vocals (track 11) *K. \\"Duddy Ken\\" Richardson – vocals (track 12) *W. \\"C.I.\\" White – vocals (track 16) *Cedric \\"Bo Hagon\\" Leonard – vocals (track 17) *Kelvin \\"Kosha\\" Seldon – vocals (track 17) *Charlene L.

He was the son of a German immigrant – Frederick Jacobus Wepener – and a Cape Colony woman – Johanna Maria Erasmus. Wepener was born in Graaf-Reinet and lived with his uncle – Lourens. He was christened by Reverend Andrew Murray of the Dutch Reformed Church. Wepener was first married to Hester Susanna Nel and then later to Hilletje Maria Levina Van Aardt. He had nine children with his second wife. ==Military career== Wepener participated in some Frontier Wars (1834–1853) as Acting Field Cornet. He moved to the farm De Nek in Aliwal North in 1850 where he took part in the Eighth Frontier War (1850–1853) (Xhosa wars) and was promoted to Commandant due to his outstanding leadership. He later migrated to the Orange Free State where he bought two farms in Bethulie district – Constantia and Moordernaarspoort. When he arrived in Orange Free State, Wepener was appointed Acting Commandant. He took part in the Free State–Basotho Wars – which were a series of wars fought between Moshoeshoe I and the Orange Free State. The three are the Senekal War (1858), Seqiti War which included two conflicts in 1856 to 1866 and 1867 to 1868. The wars resulted in the Orange Free State acquiring large tracts of land from Basotho. The first attack on Thaba Bosiu failed on 8 August 1865, and Wepener tried again on 15 August. As he ascended Thaba Bosiu, Wepener and his agterryer had made some progress up the Khubelu pass but as soon as Basotho soldiers spotted them, Wepener was shot and he died on the spot. Basotho charged and about 11 Boers were killed and about 30 were injured. ==Death== The loss of Wepener was a huge loss in the Free State as he was regarded as a remarkable and brave leader. Two of his entrusted men – Carl Mathey and Chris du Randt, snuck up at night to go look for his body. They dragged it into a shallow trench next to Adam Raubenheimer another fallen Boer. It was reported that Moshoeshoe ordered his warriors to cut out Wepener's heart out and eat it. This is due to Moshoeshoe I being impressed with the bravery of Wepener and thus he believed that if each of his warriors ate a piece of his heart, they would gain his bravery. He was first buried at Thaba Bosiu by Dr Prosper Lautre (1818–1893) of the Paris Evangelical Mission Society. Grave of Louw Wepener at his farm in Constantia Bethulie. Eleven months after the death of Wepener, his son – Dick Wepener – and four of his friends went to Thaba Bosiu to collect his father's remains for a proper burial. King Moshoeshoe I's son – Tladi – took Dick to where his father was buried. This is when Tladi told Dick that his father's heart had been eaten by warriors. His body was taken to be buried at the family farm in Constantia. The pass at Thaba Bosiu known as Khubelu pass where Wepener was killed is also known as the Wepener's pass to commemorate his death. ==Honours== Bust of Louw Wepener in front of the Wepener town hall Wepener. *A town founded in 1867 was named after Wepener.

It is generally regarded as the most collaborationist party of France. ==Formation and early years== The party was formed on 28 June 1936, by Doriot and a number of fellow former members of the French Communist Party (including Henri Barbé and Paul Marion) who had moved towards nationalism in opposition to the Popular Front. The PPF initially centered around the town of Saint-Denis, of which Doriot was mayor (as a Communist) from 1930–1934, and drew its support from the large working class population in the area. Although not avowedly nationalistic at this point, the PPF adopted many aspects of social nationalist politics, imagery and ideology, and quickly became popular among other nationalists, attracting to its ranks former members of such groups as Action Française, Jeunesses Patriotes, Croix de Feu and Solidarité Française. The party held a number of large rallies following their formation and adopted as the party flag a Celtic cross against a red, white and blue background. Members wore light blue shirts, dark blue trousers, berets and armbands bearing the party symbol as a uniform, although the uniform was not as ubiquitous as in other far right movements. Despite the Communist origins of much of its leadership (which retained the name Politburo), the party was virulently anti-Marxist, which it came to regard as a Jewish pseudo-socialism which was not working for real improvements to the situation of the French working-classes. Physical violence by PPF members (especially the PPF paramilitary wing, the Service d'Ordre) against Communist Party supporters and other perceived enemies was not uncommon. The PPF, in its initial, working class, phase, was economically populist and anti-banking. It moved closer to corporatism in 1937 when Doriot was deserted by his traditional working class base in losing the mayoral election in Saint-Denis, and the party began receiving financial support from right-wing leaders of business and finance, such as the General Manager of the Banque Worms, Gabriel Leroy-Ladurie. Doriot proposed to Colonel François de La Rocque uniting his Parti Social Français with the PPF to form an anti-Marxist alliance to be called the Front de la Liberté, but La Rocque, who was a capitalist, rejected the movement. That same year, the PPF contacted the Italian government of Benito Mussolini to request support. According to the private diary of Count Galeazzo Ciano, Mussolini's foreign minister and son-in-law): \\"Doriot's right- hand-man has asked me to continue to pay subsidies and provide weapons. He envisages a winter filled with conflicts \\"(Ciano diary, Sept. 1937). Ciano paid 300,000 francs from the coffers of Fascist Italy to Victor Arrighi (head of the Algiers section of the PPF). These funds from the Italian Fascists and French banking and business interests were used to purchase a number of newspapers, including La Liberté, which became the official party organ. In time, as the Nazi regime began to contribute a greater share of the PPF's funds, it began to advocate corporatism, and pushed for closer ties with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy in a grand alliance against the Soviet Union. ==Ideology and fascism of PPF== The PPF's ardent advocacy of collaboration with the Nazis was accompanied, somewhat discordantly, with nationalistic rhetoric. Members of the PPF were required to take the following oath: > \\"In the name of the people and of the fatherland, I swear fidelity and > devotion to the Parti Populaire Français, its ideals, and its leader. I > swear to serve until the supreme sacrifice the cause of national and popular > revolution which will leave a new, free and independent France.\\" The PPF is generally regarded to be a fascist party in its ideological, as well as its practical, orientation. The party denounced parliamentarianism and sought to limit French democracy and remake French society according to its own, authoritarian beliefs. It was vehemently opposed to both Marxism and liberalism and also wished to rid France of Freemasonry, about which it was greatly concerned. It criticised supremacy of rationalism in politics and desired a move towards politics dictated by emotion and will rather than reason. Intellectuals who are often viewed as fascists, notably Pierre Drieu La Rochelle, Ramón Fernandez, Alexis Carrel, Paul Chack, and Bertrand de Jouvenel, were members of the PPF at various times. Moreover, the PPF was anti-semitic. It had initially been ambiguous towards anti-Semitism, expressing a negative view of Jews in their literature (associating Jews with banking interests) but allowing a Jew, Alexandre Abremski, to sit on its Politburo until his death in 1938. In 1936, Doriot stated: \\"Our party [the PPF] is not anti-Semitic. It is a great national party that has better things to do than fight Jews.\\" By 1938, PPF literature was filled with references to the \\"Judeo-masonic-bolshevik\\" conspiracy. As the PPF tended more towards fascism, and especially after the French defeat and the establishment of Vichy France, anti-Semitism became much more a central feature of party policy. In 1941, Doriot, writing in the journal Au Pilori, would write: (t)he Jew is not a man. He's a stinking beast.\\" This overt anti-semitic ideology was manifested by the paramilitary Gardes Françaises (formerly the Service d'Ordre), in which many PPF members operated and which participated in wide-scale violence against Jews in France and North Africa and in the mass-deportation of Jews to concentration camps. ==The PPF during the war== After the France's defeat in the Battle of France and the establishment of the regime of Philippe Pétain at Vichy, the PPF received additional support from Germany and increased its activities. The U.S. State Department placed it on a list of organizations under the direct control of the Nazi regime.http://foia.state.gov/masterdocs/09fam/0940035aX2.pdf As a fascist party, the PPF was critical of the neotraditional authoritarian state established by Petain, criticizing the regime for being too moderate, and advocating closer military collaboration with Germany (such as sending troops to the Russian front), and modeling French government, and its racial policies, directly on those of Nazi Germany. ===The PPF and the home front=== The PPF increasingly placed anti-Semitism at its core as it collaborated with units of the Gestapo and the Milice, the French paramilitary organization led by Joseph Darnand, in violently rounding up Jews for deportation to concentration camps. The PPF paramilitaries participated in beatings, torture, assassinations and summary execution of Jews and political enemies of the Nazis. For this, the Germans rewarded them by allowing them the right to steal property from the Jews they arrested. After Pierre Laval ascended of to leadership of the government on April 18, 1942, he requested that Nazi Germany allow him to force the PPF to merge into his own supporters, but the Nazis denied that request. However, as Laval moved France closer to the Nazi regime, the PPF ceased to be as useful to the Nazis as advocates of greater collaboration. As a result, the PPF was politically marginalized and their role as critics of the regime was diminished, although it did not cease entirely. By the end of the war, the PPF had virtually ceased to function as a political party, the attention of its leader and many of its members turning more directly to participation in the Nazi war effort. The PPF and the collaborationist Rassemblement national populaire (RNP) also established the Comité ouvrier de secours immédiat in March 1942. This organisation sought to aid victims of the Allied bombing of France and, following the Normandy landings, aided refugees fleeing the fighting.Olivier Pigoreau, \\"Rendez-vous tragique à Mengen\\" 53-61 in (2009) 34 Batailles: l'Histoire Militaire du XXe siècle 52-61, at 61, n.19 and p. 52 Other groups linked to the PPF by common membership had less humanitarian motives: in Lyon a Mouvement national anti- terroriste was established to combat the Resistance by fighting \\"terror with terror\\"; other PPF members joined the Gardes Française set up by German police authorities as a counterweight to the Milice, which was deemed too French, or the Groupes d'action pour la justice sociale which hunted down French youth who went into hiding rather than do the mandatory labour work under the STO programme. These groups often operated beyond the control of the party.Olivier Pigoreau, \\"Rendez-vous tragique à Mengen\\" 53-61 in (2009) 34 Batailles: l'Histoire Militaire du XXe siècle 52-61, p. 52 Headquarters of the South West branch of the PPF (Bordeaux, 1936). Debate exists as to whether PPF members actually fought against the Allies in Normandy. Doriot's biographers differ on the subject: Jean-Paul Brunet argues that the PPF did fight against the Allied invasion while Dieter Wolf denies any such action occurred.Jean-Paul Brunet, Jacques Doriot, du communisme au fascisme Balland, 1996; Dieter Wolf, Doriot, du communisme à la collaboration Fayard, 1969 However, Doriot, in German uniform, and Beugras, the clandestine PPF intelligence chief, visited the Normandy front in July 1944. PPF recruits were trained in espionage and sabotage and some were shot after being captured by the Allies while attempting to infiltrate Allied lines in Northern France.See Olivier Pigoreau, \\"Rendez-vous tragique à Mengen\\" 53-61 in (2009) 34 Batailles: l'Histoire Militaire du XXe siècle 52-61, p. 52 and ensuing articles in the same series published in Batailles in 2009 about the PPF ===The PPF and wartime activities outside metropolitan France=== In 1941, Doriot urged PPF members to join the newly formed Légion des Volontaires Français (LVF) to fight on the eastern front. The unit's performance was poor and the following year it was removed to anti-partisan actions in Belarus. In 1944 the LVF, along with a separate unit, the Waffen-SS Französische SS-Freiwilligen-Grenadier-Regiment (Waffen-SS French SS-Volunteer Grenadier Regiment), and French collaborators fleeing the Allied advance in the west were amalgamated into the Waffen-Grenadier-Brigade der SS \\"Charlemagne\\". In February 1945 the unit was officially upgraded to a division and renamed 33.Waffen-Grenadier-Division der SS \\"Charlemagne\\". Doriot himself saw action and served three tours of duty on the Eastern Front between 1941 and 1944. In his absence, leadership of the PPF officially passed to a directorate. However effective leadership rested with Maurice-Yvan Sicard who resisted attempts to merge the party into a wider movement.David Littlejohn, The Patriotic Traitors, London: Heinemann, 1972, p. 272 The PPF attempted to aid German intelligence efforts and/or conduct sabotage activities in French territories occupied by the Allies. On January 8, 1943 a group of PPF militants originally from Maghreb, Germans and sympathetic Tunisians were parachuted into Southern Tunisia to conduct sabotage - but were arrested almost immediately.Olivier Pigoreau, \\"Le PPF en guerre - Node de Code: Atlas\\" 36 (2009) Batailles: L'histoire militaire du XXe siècle, 60-69, at p.62 From 1943 to 1944, PPF and collaborationist agents were parachuted into North Africa, where, under codename Atlas, they were to transmit information on Allied military preparations and the local political situation to PPF agents in France, who in turn, were to pass this information to German intelligence. These intelligence activities occurred under the aegis of Albert Beugras, head of the PPF's clandestine Service de renseignment, and whose activities were unknown even to the political cadres of the Party. Not only did Atlas fail to transmit the desired political information, but the head of the network, Edmond Lantham, a professional soldier and former member of Vichy's , went over to the Free French and ensured that Atlas broadcast misinformation to the PPF and German intelligence. Atlas broadcast that the Allies intended to invade Sardinia or Greece rather than Sicily in 1943, therefore reinforcing British intelligence's famous Operation Mincemeat, and spread misinformation that disguised the Allied invasion plans of Italy and Provence. Atlas continued transmitting misinformation from Allied occupied Marseilles and Paris in 1944. Doriot and Beugras did not discover the 'treason' until 1945.see Paul Paillole (wartime commander of the Sécurité militaire, who helped turn Atlas), Services spéciaux, 1935-1945 éditions Robert Laffont, 1975, 484-488, 496) and Olivier Pigoreau, \\"Le PPF en guerre - Node de Code: Atlas\\" 36 (2009) Batailles: L'histoire militaire du XXe siècle, 60-69. Paillole notes that post-war communication with his Abewehr counterpart, Lt. Col. Oscar Reile, suggests that the Abewehr was aware that Atlas had been turned within months (p. 488). Pigoreau suggests that the Abewehr may have allowed the dangerous misinformation to influence Germany's OKW nonetheless as part of the resistance to the Nazi regime within the Abewehr (p. 69). In 1944, Doriot moved to Germany where he competed for the leadership of the French government-in-exile with the members of the former Vichy regime based in the Sigmaringen enclave. The PPF based itself in Mainau, set up its own radio station, Radio-Patrie, at Bad Mergentheim and published its own paper Le Petit Parisien.Olivier Pigoreau, \\"Rendez-vous tragique à Mengen\\" 53-61 in (2009) 34 Batailles: l'Histoire Militaire du XXe siècle 52-61 The PPF was also involved in setting up training centres for French recruits to train operatives in conducting intelligence and sabotage activities, some of whom the Germans dropped by parachute into Allied occupied France.see Pierre-Philippe Lambert and Gérard Le Marrec, Les Français sous le casque allemand Granchier, 1994. Some 95 Frenchmen were dropped into Allied occupied France, but some were Milice or Franciste members. On February 22, 1945, Doriot, attired in his SS uniform and being driven in a Nazi officer's car, was killed by Allied strafers near Mengen, Württemberg, Germany, while en route from Mainau to Sigmaringen. The PPF movement did not survive the death of its leader, and no attempt was made to revive it in postwar France. ==Members== See :Category:French Popular Party politicians. ==See also== * National Popular Rally — associated with former French Section of the Workers' International members *Jeunesse Populaire Française ==References== * Robert Soucy, French Fascism: The Second Wave 1933-1939, 1995 * G.

The proposed format also includes new standards for projection to maximize the efficiencies of the Univisium format. ==Predecessor== The 2:1 aspect ratio was first used in the 1950s (April 1st, 1953) for one of the two flat formats that Universal Pictures developed (alongside 1.85:1), the RKO Superscope format, and as an option in several other cinematographic formats. ==The main proposal== In 1998, cinematographer Vittorio Storaro announced his plans for a new film format, originally to be called Univision,Univision is the original format name used in the proposal document (see External links) and in early interviews. It was likely changed to Univisium to avoid confusion with the Spanish-language Univision broadcast network. in an interview with International Photographer magazine. As Storaro stated in his written proposal \\"Recently, any movie – no matter how big or small, successful or not – will, after a very short life on the big screen, have a much longer life on an electronic screen. Today the answer print is made for both of these two different media. ...Having these two different media, with essentially two different aspect ratios, each of us (directors, production designers, cinematographers, camera Operators, etc.) shares the nightmare of compromising the composition of the Image. Looking through a viewfinder, a camera, or a monitor, we are always faced with at least two images of the same subject.\\"Storaro, Vittorio and Storaro, Fabrizio (1998). Univisium. Storaro feels in the future of cinema, films will be photographed in either high-definition video for small, intimate digital projection theaters, or in 65 mm for \\"big audience... large screen\\" films. In the cinematographer's opinion, as all films will be one of the two formats, he suggests a common aspect ratio compromise of 2.00:1 (mathematical average of 65 mm 2.20:1 and HD 1.78:1) be adopted for all films, 65 mm theatrical, HD theatrical and television. As he told American Cinematographer writer Bob Fisher, \\"I believe it is very important for audiences to see films exactly the way they were composed by the director and cinematographer. This is a solution.\\"Fisher, Bob (February 2001). \\"Guiding Light\\" American Cinematographer Magazine. pp. 72–83 ==35 mm Univisium camera proposal== 3-perf format with two digital soundtracks present. At far left and far right, outside the perforations, is the SDDS soundtrack as an image of a digital signal. Between the perforations (on the left side) is the Dolby Digital soundtrack (note the tiny Dolby \\"Double D\\" logo in the center of each area between the perforations). Storaro recognized that ubiquitous HD origination was not yet viable and therefore proposed an alteration to standard 35 mm photography to create a 2.00:1 aspect ratio and economize on film. By using a negative area similar to that of the Super 35 frame (which utilizes the full width of a 35 mm film frame \\"perf-to-perf\\" as opposed to traditional 35 mm which utilizes a smaller area of the 35 mm frame offset to the right to accommodate space for an optical soundtrack) combined with 3-perf frame size (as opposed to standard 35 mm photography which uses four perforations per frame). The Univisium camera would use an aperture opening of 24mm × 12mm (.945\\" × .472\\") and three perforations per frame, which would eliminate the waste associated with 2.40:1 Super 35 mm photography (wherein nearly 50% of the frame is discarded) by creating a natural 2.00:1 aspect ratio utilizing the whole film area. In addition to using the full film area, using three perforations per frame as opposed to four equates to using 25% less film for the same shooting time. With the traditional four perforations per frame, 35 mm film (at 24 frames per second) runs at 90 feet per minute (4 minutes 26 seconds per 400 feet of film), three perforations per frame runs at 67.5 feet per minute (5 minutes 56 seconds per 400 feet of film).Holben, Jay & Bankston, Douglas (February 2000). \\"Inventive New Options for Film\\" American Cinematographer Magazine pp. 105-107 This would mean each magazine of film would have 33% more shooting time and a production that shot the same overall length of time as a four-perforation film would use 25% less film. The proposal also points out that the 2.00:1 aspect ratio can be achieved using standard spherical lenses, which, compared to their anamorphic counterparts, are cheaper, faster (require less light), and have more photographic depth of field and less visual imperfections. There are also a greater selection of spherical prime and zoom lenses than there are anamorphic lenses. 3-perf also results in a quieter camera than 4-perf as there is less intermittent movement per frame. The format also calls for shooting 25 frames per second, which eliminates problems associated with transferring film to video in the PAL and SECAM system and is still fairly simple to transfer to the NTSC video format. ===35 mm Univisium projection proposal=== Storaro suggests a renovation to standard film projectors to present a 3-perf frame and eliminate the need for an anamorphic print to be made (to optically squeeze the 2:1 3-perf aspect ratio into a 1.33:1 4-perf frame). As the image will fill the full film area (perf-to-perf) there is no room for a traditional optical soundtrack and Univisium requires two digital soundtracks, one for backup (which reside outside of the perforations on the edge of the film; DTS, Sony Dynamic Digital Sound, Dolby Digital). The projectors would run at 25 frames per second, just as the cameras do. As a compromise to standard technology (for the time being), Storaro says an anamorphic print can be made and presented in 24 frames per second with a digital and/or optical soundtrack. However, with the rise of the DCP (Digital Cinema Package), the 2:1 image can be projected from a flat (1.85:1) container in either 2K (1998 × 999) or 4K (3996 × 1998), with mild letterboxing. ==Univisium in use== Although no film has utilized the full aspects of the proposal, particularly with regard to the projection standards, Storaro has since used Univisium for nearly all of his films.

(July 2004). \\"Storaro discussed making of Zapata\\" Retrieved June 27, 2006. and Clairmont Cameras have altered Arriflex 435 and 535B cameras for use on Storaro films that use Univisium and 3-perf pull-down.

Retrieved 2007-06-11. This has proved controversial with many film enthusiasts, who believe that regardless of Storaro's attempt to unify all aspect ratios, films should be viewed in the ratio they were filmed in, without any cropping. Due to this backlash, Apocalypse Now and Reds use their original aspect ratios for Blu-ray release. Other films that were reframed to the Univisium aspect ratio on DVD include the 1998 DVD release of Top Gun (1986), the 1999 & 2004 DVDs of Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country (1991), and the original DVD release of Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery (1997). Many trailers of upcoming films from 20th Century Studios that are shot in the 2.39:1 aspect ratio are cropped to this format when they play ahead of any movies that were shot in 1.85:1. According to IMDB technical specification statistics, there are over 700 titles with 2:1 aspect ratios, and the number has been growing in recent years.https://www.imdb.com/interfaces Most films and TV shows that originate on streaming platforms are shot this way, although a small amount of theatrical feature films use it. Netflix production and post-production requirements state that they prefer content up to 2:1 aspect ratio; anything wider must be evaluated and discussed. ===Aspect ratio used in music videos=== *Miranda Cosgrove: \\"Kissin U\\" (2010) *Girls' Generation: \\"Hoot\\" (2010) *Cidergirl: \\"Melancholy\\" (2017) *Shawn Mendes and Camila Cabello: \\"Señorita\\" (2019) *Megan Thee Stallion feat.

Counted as one of the heritage edifices of Kerala, this church is one of the finest and most impressive churches in India and visited by tourists the whole year round. It is a place of devotion as well as a center of historic significance, endowed with architectural and artistic grandeur and colours of the gothic style. The basilica serves as the Cathedral church of the Diocese of Cochin. It was built originally by the Portuguese and elevated to a Cathedral by Pope Paul IV in 1558, was spared by the Dutch conquerors who destroyed many Catholic buildings. Later the British demolished the structure and commissioned a new building in 1887. Consecrated in 1905, Santa Cruz was proclaimed a Basilica by Pope John Paul II in 1984. ==History== === Portuguese missionaries and Santa Cruz Church : 1505 - 1558 === The history of Santa Cruz Cathedral Basilica begins with the arrival of Portuguese missionaries along with the second Portuguese fleet under Pedro Álvares Cabral on 24 December 1500. The King Unni Goda Varma Tirumulpadu (Trimumpara Raja ) of Kingdom of Cochin received them very warmly. This caused the Zamorin of Calicut to declare war against Kingdom of Cochin. But the Portuguese army under Commander Dom Afonso de Albuquerque who reached Cochin in 1503, defeated the enemies of the King of Cochin and in return he gave them permission to build a fort in Kochi. In 1505, Dom Francisco de Almeida the first Portuguese Viceroy got permission from the Kochi Raja to build a church edifice using stones and mortar which was unheard of at that time as the local prejudices were against such a structure for any purpose other than a royal palace or a temple. The foundation stone of the Santa Cruz church was laid on 3 May 1505, the feast day of the Invention of the Holy Cross, hence the magnificent edifice when completed was named Santa Cruz. This church was located on the eastern side of the present Children’s Park, Fort Cochin. The basilica hosts the Relic of The Holy Cross of Our Lord Jesus Christ for a long time. This is at the Right side of the church. ===Raising to Cathedral and demolition : 1558 - 1795 === In 1558, Pope Paul IV, raised the Santa Cruz Church to the status of a Cathedral along with the erection of the second diocese in India - Diocese of Cochin,Diocese of Cochin erected  Original Catholic Encyclopedia www.gcatholic.org  Diocese of Cochinwww.catholic-hierarchy.org  Diocese of Cochin suffragan (other being Diocese of Malacca) to the Archdiocese of Goa.Archdiocese of Goa - suffragan sees of Cochin and Malacca Inscription Outside the Church The Dutch who conquered Cochin in 1663, destroyed all Catholic buildings. Only the St. Francis Church and the Cathedral escaped this fate. The Dutch made the cathedral their arms storehouse. Later it fell into the hands of the British who demolished it when they took over Cochin in 1795. One of the decorative granite pillars of the destroyed Cathedral is still kept as a monument at the southeastern corner of the present Basilica premises. ===Erection of the present day Santa Cruz Basilica : 1886 - present === About 100 years later, Bishop João Gomes Ferreira (1887–1897), a missionary and the Bishop of Cochin, took initiative to re-erect the Cathedral and commenced the plan of its construction. But it was the next Bishop, Mateus de Oliveira Xavier (1897–1908) who completed the edifice. The cathedral was consecrated on 19 November 1905 by Bishop Sebastião José Pereira, Bishop of Damao. Considering its antiquity, artistic dignity and historical importance, Pope John Paul II through a special Decree \\"Constat Sane Templum Sanctae Cruci\\" of 23 August 1984, raised the Santa Cruz Cathedral to the status of Basilica. Inscription at the bottom of the tower The church has two lofty spires and a remarkably bright, white-washed exterior and a pastel-colored interior. The interiors of the church are mostly Gothic, with the main altar decorated by the famous Italian painter Fra Antonio Moscheni, S.J., and his disciple De Gama of Mangalore. Unfortunately, Fra Antonio Moscheni died here on 15 November 1905, four days before the newly built Church was consecrated. The columns decorated with frescoes and murals, the seven large canvas paintings on the passion and death on the Cross, especially the painting of the Last Supper, modelled on the famous painting of Leonardo da Vinci and the beautiful stained glass windows add to the artistic grandeur of the place. The paintings that adorn the ceiling depict scenes from the Via Crucis of Christ.

She served as Minister for International Development Cooperation from 2006 to 2013, member of the Swedish Riksdag from 2002 to 2013 and deputy chairman of her party from 2003 to 2015. == Early life == Carlsson was born and raised in Lund in Skåne. She was at one time chairperson of the Moderate Youth League district in that county. At the Battle of Lycksele, when current party leader Fredrik Reinfeldt was elected chairman of the Youth League, Carlsson was elected vice chairman. == Political career == ===Member of the European Parliament, 1995-2002=== After working as an auditor, Carlsson joined the Moderate Party office in 1994. In 1995, she was elected to the European Parliament and served until 2002. In parliament, she served on the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy (1995-1999) and on the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy (1999-2002). In addition to her committee assignments, she was vice-chair of the parliament’s delegation to the European Economic Area Joint Parliamentary Committee (EEA) from 1995 until 1997. ===Career in national politics=== In the 2002 national elections, Carlsson was elected to the Riksdag for Stockholm. In 1999, she was elected vice chairman of the Moderate Party. With the growing co-operation between the Swedish opposition parties, Carlsson was appointed to head the group co-ordinating foreign policy. This led to speculation about her being a possible candidate to the office of Minister for Foreign Affairs after Alliance for Sweden's victory in the 2006 election. With a number of the Moderate Party Riksdag members from Östergötland resigning, she decided to stand in her home county in 2006. While she won the internal primaries, she was only placed second on the list after Gunnar Axén, but comfortably reached re-election as the party went from three to four seats from the county.Allmänna val 17 september 2006 - Östergötland, Swedish election authority She continues to make her home in Tyresö outside Stockholm. From 2007, Carlsson was a member of the World Bank Group’s High Level Advisory Council on Women's Economic Empowerment, which was chaired by Danny Leipziger and Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul.The World Bank Group Advisory Council on Women’s Economic Empowerment World Bank Group, Gender Equality as Smart Economics newsletter, March 2008. In her capacity as minister, Carlsson also chaired the Stockholm-based Commission on Climate Change and Development (CCCD), a body made up of 13 international experts and established by the Swedish government in 2007 with the aim of looking at how countries can adapt to climate change. In its final report, the commission recommended in 2009 that poor countries already suffering from the impact of climate change urgently need up to $2 billion to help adjust and cope.Megan Davies (May 14, 2009), Poorest need funds to combat climate change: report Reuters. In September 2009 Carlsson led, together with Karel De Gucht, European Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection, a delegation to Zimbabwe for discussions with President Robert Mugabe. This was to discuss the lifting of targeted EU sanctions against him and more than 200 of his political allies and related businesses. He and his Zanu-PF party have for years loudly argued that these measures are directly responsible for Zimbabwe's economic collapse. The EU team did not buy that argument, and would not even put the sanctions issue on the negotiating table at that time, according to a BBC report.\\"Tentative thaw in EU-Zimbabwe ties\\" Andrew Harding, BBC News, Harare\\"Mugabe hails landmark EU meeting\\", BBC News (Africa).

Environmental standards are set by a government and can include prohibition of specific activities, mandating the frequency and methods of monitoring, and requiring permits for the use of land or water. Standards differ depending on the type of environmental activity. Environmental standards produce quantifiable and enforceable laws that promote environmental protection. The basis for the standards is determined by scientific opinions from varying disciplines, the views of the general population, and social context. As a result, the process of determining and implementing the standards is complex and is usually set within legal, administrative or private contexts. The human environment is distinct from the natural environment. The concept of the human environment considers that humans are permanently interlinked with their surroundings, which are not just the natural elements (air, water, and soil), but also culture, communication, co-operation, and institutions. Environmental standards should preserve nature and the environment, protect against damages, and repair past damage caused by human activity. == Development of environmental standards == Historically, the development of environmental standards was influenced by two competing ideologies: ecocentrism and anthropocentrism. Ecocentrism frames the environment as having an intrinsic value divorced from the human utility, while anthropocentrism frames the environment as only having value if it helps humanity survive. This has led to problems in establishing standards. Within the past few decades, the sensibility of people towards the topic of environmentalism has increased. In turn, the demand for protecting the environment has risen. This movement towards environmentalism was likely caused by the increased understanding of medicine and science, as well as advances in the measurement of factors contributing to environmental damage. This improved measurement allows scientists to further understand the impact of human-caused environmental destruction on human health and the biodiversity which composes the natural environment. These developments in science have been fundamental for the setting of environmental standards. Environmental standards often define the desired state (e.g. the pH of a lake should be between 6.5 and 7.5) or limit alterations (e.g., no more than 50% of the natural forest may be damaged). Statistical methods are used to determine the specific states and limits the enforceable environmental standard. Where environmental issues are concerned, uncertainties should always be taken into consideration. The first step to developing a standard is the evaluation of the specific risk. The expected value of the occurrence of the risk must be calculated. Then, possible damage should be classified. Three different types of damages exist - changes due to physiochemical environmental damages, ecological damages in plants and animals, and damages to human health. To establish an acceptable risk, in view of the expected collective benefit, the risk-induced costs and the costs of risk avoidance must be socially balanced. The comparison is difficult to express in monetary units. Furthermore, the risks have multiple dimensions, which should be reached with a correlation at the end of the balancing process. At the balancing process, the following steps should be considered: # To establish objectives that serve both the protection of life, health and environment, and allow a rational allocation of social resources. # Studying the possible outcomes of implementing these objectives. # Considering social costs or damages, including opportunity costs and benefits which will arise when any of the available options are not further pursued. Into the balancing process, the fairness of distributing the risks and the resilience with respect to sustaining the productivity of the environment should be observed too. In addition to the standard, an implementation rule, indicating under what circumstances the standard will be considered violated, is commonly part of the regulations. Penalties and other procedures for dealing with regions out of compliance with the standard may be part of the legislation. == Governmental institutions setting environmental standards == Environmental standards are set by many different institutions, and most of the standards continue to be based on the principle of voluntary self-commitment. === United Nations (UN) === The UN, with 193 member states, is the largest intergovernmental organization. The environmental policy of the UN has a huge impact on the setting of international environmental standards. At the Earth summit in 1992, held in Rio, the member states acknowledged their negative impact on the environment for the first time. During this and the following Millennium Declaration, the first development goals for environmental issues were set. Since then, the risk of the catastrophe caused by extreme weather has been enhanced by the overuse of natural resources and global warming. At the Paris Agreement in 2015, the UN determined 17 Goals for sustainable development. Besides the fight against global poverty, the main focus of the goals is the preservation of our planet. These goals set a baseline for global environmentalism. The environmental areas of water, energy, oceans, ecosystems, sustainable production, consumer behavior and climate protection were covered by the goals. The goals contained explanations on which mediums were required to reach them. Whether the member states fulfill the settled goals is questionable. Some members perceive inspection or any other control from external parties as an intervention into their inner affairs. For this reason, the implementation and follow-up are only controlled by the Voluntary National Reviews. The main control is done by statistical values, which are called indicators. These indicators deliver information if the goals are reached. === European Union === (See also: Environmental policy of the European Union) Within the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Union integrates a self-commitment towards the environment. In Title XX, Article 191.1, it is settled: “Union policy on the environment shall contribute to the pursuit of the following objectives: — preserving, protecting and improving the quality of the environment, — protecting human health, — prudent and rational utilization of natural resources, — promoting measures at international level to deal with regional or worldwide environmental; problems, and in particular combating climate change.” All environmental actions are based on this article and lead to a suite of environmental laws. European environmental regulation covers air, biotechnological, chemical, climate change, environmental economics, health, industry and technology, land use, nature and biodiversity, noise, protection of the ozone layer, soil, sustainable development, waste, and water. The European Environment Agency (EEA) consults the member states about environmental issues, including standards. The environmental standards set by European legislation include precise parametric concentrations of pollutants and also includes target environmental concentrations to be achieved by specific dates. === United States === In the United States, the development of standards is decentralized. These standards were developed by more than a hundred different institutions, many of which are private. The method of handling environmental standards is a partly fragmented plural system, which is mainly affected by the market. Under the Trump Administration, Climate standards have increasingly become a site of conflict in the politics of global warming. ====Ambient air quality standards==== The National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) are set by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to regulate pollutants in the air. The enforcement of these standards is designed to prevent further degradation of air quality. States may set their own ambient standards, so long as they are lower than the national standard. The NAAQS regulates the six criteria for air pollutants: sulfur dioxide (SO2), particulate matter (PM10), carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and lead (Pb). To ensure that the ambient standards are met, the EPA uses the Federal Reference Method (FRM) and Federal Equivalent Method (FEM) systems to measure the number of pollutants in the air and check that they are within the legal limits. ====Air emission standards==== Emission standards are national regulations managed by the EPA that control the amount and concentration of pollutants that can be released into the atmosphere to maintain air quality, human health, and regulate the release of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2), oxides of nitrogen and oxides of sulfur. The standards are established in two phases to stay up-to-date, with final projections aiming to collectively save Americans $1.7 trillion in fuel costs and reduce the amount of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) by 6 billion metric tons. Similar to the ambient standards, individuals states may also tighten regulations. For example, California set their own emissions standards through the California Air Resources Board (CARB), and these standards have been adopted by some other states. Emission standards also regulate the number of pollutants released by heavy industry and for electricity. The technological standards set by the EPA do not necessarily enforce the use of specific technologies, but set minimum performance levels for different industries. The EPA often encourages technological improvement by setting standards that are not achievable with current technologies. These standards are always set based on the industry's top performers to promote the overall improvement of the industry as a whole. == Impact of non-governmental organizations on environmental standards == === International Organization of Standardization === The International Organization of Standardization (IOS) develops a large number of voluntary standards. With 163 member states, it has a comprehensive outreach. The standards set by the IOS were often transmitted into national standards by different nations. About 363,000 companies and organizations worldwide have the ISO 14001 certificate, a standard for environmental management created to improve the environmental performance of an organization and legal aspects as well as reaching environmental aims. Most of the national and international environmental management standards include the ISO 14000 series. In light of the UN Sustainable Development Goals, ISO has identified several families of standards which help meet SDG 13 which is focused on Climate Action for global warming. === Greenpeace === Greenpeace is a popular non-governmental organization that deals with biodiversity and the environment. Their activities have had a great global impact on environmental issues. Greenpeace encourages public attention and enforces governments or companies to adapt and set environmental standards through activities recording special environmental issues. Their main focus is on forests, the sea, climate change, and toxic chemicals. For example, the organization set a standard about toxic chemicals together with the textiles sector, creating the concept 2020, which plans to banish all toxic chemicals from textile production by 2020. === World Wildlife Fund === The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) focuses on how to produce the maximum yield in agriculture while conserving biodiversity. They try to educate, protect, and reach policy changes and incentives to achieve these goals. == Economy == Environmental standards in the economy are set through external motivation. First, companies need to fulfill the environmental law of the countries in which they operate. Moreover, environmental standards are based on voluntary self-commitment which means companies implement standards for their business. These standards should exceed the level of the requirements of governmental regulations. If companies set further-reaching standards, they try to fulfill the wishes of stakeholders. At the process of setting environmental standards, three different stakeholders have the main influence. The first stakeholder, the government, is the strongest determinate, followed by the influence of the customers. Nowadays, there is an increasing number of people, who consider environmental factors during their purchasing decision. The third stakeholder who forces companies to set environmental standards is industrial participants. If companies are part of industrial networks, they are forced to fulfill the codes of conduct of these networks. This code of conduct is often set to improve the collective reputation of an industry. Another driving force of industry participants could be a reaction to a competitors action. The environmental standards set by companies themselves can be divided into two dimensions: operational environmental policies and the message sent in advertising and public communications. === Operational environmental policies === This can be the environmental management, audits, controls, or technologies. In this dimension, the regulations tend to be closely connected with other function areas, e.g. lean production. Furthermore, it could be understood that multinational companies tend to set cross-country harmonized environmental government regulations and therefore reach a higher performance level of environmental standards. It is often argued that companies focus on the second dimension: the message sent in advertising and public communications. To satisfy the stakeholders' requirement, companies were focused on the public impression of their environmental self-commitment standards. Often the real implementation does not play an important role. A lot of companies settle the responsibility for the implementation of low- budget departments. The workers, who were in charge of the standards missing time and financial resources to guarantee a real implementation. Furthermore, within the implementation, goal conflicts arise. The biggest concern of companies is that environmental protection is more expansive compared to the gained beneficial effects. But, there are a lot of positive cost-benefit- calculation for environmental standards set by companies themselves. It is observed that companies often set environmental standards after a public crisis. Sometimes environmental standards were already set by companies to avoid public crises. As to whether environmental self-commitment standards are effective, is controversial. == See also == * Environmental compliance * Emission standard * Fairtrade certification * Environmental certification * Environmental data * Environmental monitoring * Environmental performance * Environmental law ==References== == External links == * European Environmental Citizens Organization for Standardisation *ISO 14000 Environmental management ","title":"Environmental standard"},{"id":"3239183","text":"Anna Nyholm and Gunnar Axén, 2010 Hans Gunnar Axén (born 9 July 1967) is a Swedish Moderate Party politician and a member of the Swedish Riksdag for Östergötland from 1998 to 2014.

His father was Menakhem Mendl Kahanovich, a smoked-fish merchant at Astrakhan on the Volga River; his mother's name was Leah. He received a traditional religious education, but was drawn through his reading to secular and Enlightenment ideas, as well as to Zionism. In 1904 he left Berdychiv hoping to evade the military draft, and this was probably the time when he started using the pseudonym. He moved to Zhytomyr, near Kiev, where he earned a modest living as a teacher of Hebrew at an orphanage for Jewish boys. At that time he also wrote his first book, in Yiddish, Gedankn un motivn - lider in proze (\\"Ideas and Motifs - Prose Poems\\"), published in Vilna in 1907. He also made the acquaintance of the Yiddish writer I. L. Peretz, whom he greatly admired. Peretz recognised Der Nister's literary talents, and helped and encouraged him to publish his prose Hekher fun der Erd (\\"Higher than the Earth\\"), published in Warsaw in 1910. In 1912, Kahanovich married Rokhel Zilberberg, a teacher. Their daughter, Hodel, was born in July 1913, shortly after the publication of his third book, Gezang un gebet (\\"Song and Prayer\\") in Kiev. At the outbreak of World War I, he found work in the timber industry, which gave him exemption from military service. He continued to write and produced in 1918/19 the first of his books for children, Mayselech in ferzn (\\"Erzählungen in Versen\\"; \\"Stories in Verse\\"). Also at this time he translated several of Andersen's fairy tales. ==Life== In 1920, he lived for a few months in a Jewish orphanage at Malakhovka, Moscow Oblast, where he worked as a teacher for Jewish orphans, whose parents had been killed during the Tsarist pogroms from 1904 to 1906. Here he met other Jewish artists and intellectuals, among them David Hofstein, Leib Kvitko and Marc Chagall.Dara Horn, The World to Come, New York: W. W. Norton, 2006, p. 313. Probably in early 1921 Kahanovich left Malakowka and moved with his family to Kovno (now Kaunas), Lithuania. Here he had great difficulty earning a living, and decided to leave, as many other Russian intellectuals were doing, and moved to Berlin, Germany, where his son Joseph was born. From 1922 to 1924 he worked there as a freelancer for the Yiddish journal Milgroim (\\"Pomegranate\\") and also edited, along with David Bergelson, several Yiddish literary journals, though they didn't last long. In Berlin, he also published a two-volume collection of his short stories under the title Gedakht (\\"Imagined\\"). The book was his first modest literary success. When the Milgroim closed in 1924, he moved with his family to Hamburg, where he worked for two years for the Soviet Trade Mission. In 1926, like many fellow exiles, he returned to the Soviet Union and settled in Kharkiv. In 1929, he published in Kiev Fun mayne giter (\\"From My Estates\\"). The work contained a complicated web of metaphors tied to Hasidic mysticism - especially on the Kabbalah and the symbolic stories of Nachman of Breslov - that can create a universe of images and parables, folk tales, children's poems and rhymes. His long sentences create a hypnotic rhythm. But they also reflect the increasing pressure that has been exerted at that time by the Soviet regime on Jewish intellectuals. However, the symbol-laden work, rich in Jewish themes, was declared reactionary by the Soviet regime and its literary critics. He was subjected to the increasingly stringent Soviet censorship. In 1929, he was criticized when the Russian Yiddish newspaper Di Royte Velt (\\"The Red World\\") reprinted his tale Unter a Ployt (\\"Bottom Fence\\"). The then president of the Russian Yiddish Writers Federation, Moyshe Litvakov, initiated a smear campaign at the end of which Der Nister had to renounce the literary symbolism. He tried now to write his literary work within the constraints of prevailing socialist realism and began to write stories. These collected essays appeared in 1934 under the title Hoyptshtet (\\"Capital cities\\"). He stopped publishing his original works and earned a living as a journalist. In the early 1930s he worked almost exclusively as a journalist and translator, translating works by Tolstoy, Victor Hugo and Jack London. His own literary work was limited to four small collections of short stories for children. Just before World War II, the Soviet government briefly adopted less censorious policies over writings considered to be promoting Zionism. Der Nister began working on his real masterpiece: Di Mishpokhe Mashber (\\"The Family Mashber\\"). The first volume of work appeared in 1939 in Moscow. The work was almost universally praised by critics, and he seemed to be rehabilitated. But the success did not last long. The limited edition of the first volume sold out quickly, but the Second World War and the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, made publication of a second edition impossible. The second volume, dedicated to his daughter Hodel, who starved to death at the siege of Leningrad in early 1942, was not published until 1948 in New York. The manuscript of the third volume, the completion of which Der Nister, mentioned in a letter, has been lost. During World War II, Der Nister was evacuated to Tashkent, where he wrote stories about the horrors of the persecution of Jews in German-occupied Poland, which had been described to him by friends firsthand. These collected stories were published in 1943 under the title Korbones (\\"Victims\\") in Moscow, where he had retired with his second wife Lena Singalowska, a former actress of the Yiddish theater in Kiev. In April 1942, Stalin ordered the formation of the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee designed to influence international public opinion and organize political and material support for the Soviet fight against Nazi Germany, particularly from the West. Solomon Mikhoels, the popular actor and director of the Moscow State Jewish Theatre, was appointed the JAC chairman. Other members were Der Nister, Itzik Feffer, Peretz Markish and Samuel Halkin. They wrote texts and petitions as cries for help against the Nazi pogroms. Among others, the texts were printed in U.S. newspapers. The JAC also raised funds. In 1947, Der Nister made a trip to Birobidzhan, the USSR Jewish Autonomous Region near the Chinese border. He traveled there on a special migrant train, together with a thousand Holocaust survivors, to evaluate the development of the self-governing Jewish settlement in this area. However, very soon Stalin changed policy to the extermination of Jewish writers and the destruction of Jewish culture in the Soviet Union. In February 1949, Der Nister was one of the last of the Jewish writers arrested. The Soviet authorities officially reported Der Nister died on 4 June 1950 in an unknown Soviet prison hospital. Many of Der Nister's contemporaries would be killed in August 1952 in the Night of the Murdered Poets, including Itzik Feffer, Peretz Markish, David Hofstein, Leib Kvitko and David Bergelson. Der Nister's last writings, describing the persecution and destruction of the Jewish communities in Europe under the Nazi regime, and hinting at Soviet persecution as well, were collected in a work, Vidervuks, published posthumously in 1969. Israel Joshua Singer, another famous Yiddish novelist, once said of Der Nister that \\"had writers of the whole world been given a chance to read [his] work, they would have broken their pens.” ==Burial Site== For more than a half-century after his death in captivity, Der Nister's place of death was not known to the public. In August 2017, researchers from Israel and Russia located his remains at a prisoner cemetery in the village of Abez, near Vorkuta, where he was recorded to have died on June 4, 1950. The researchers set up an improvised memorial atop his unmarked grave consisting of a Star of David fashioned from barbed wire.JTA \\"Der Nister hidden no more.

His best-known work, Di mishpokhe Mashber (\\"The Family Mashber\\"), is a naturalistic family saga. The work is a realistically written family saga of Jewish life in his native city Berdychiv at the end of the 19th century, with the three brothers as main actors: Moshe is a proud business man; Luzi is a skeptic mystic and benefactor who believes with brave defiance in the eternity of the Jewish people, probably a self- representation of Kahanovich; and Alter is a philanthropic altruist. David Roskies calls the depiction of the protagonist, Moshe, \\"the most finely wrought portrait of a hasidic merchant in all of Yiddish literature.\\"Roskies, David (1996). A Bridge of Longing. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press. . p. 218 As in the novel, whose protagonist's brother joins the Breslover Hasidim, Pinchas's brother Aaron did the same. Der Nister himself was influenced by Rebbe Nachman's Hasidic parables, though this manifests in his fiction, Roskies argues, through a filter of Russian modernism, and authors like Andrei Bely also influenced his work.Roskies, David (1996) A Bridge of Longing. p. 195. Di mishpokhe Mashber (\\"The Family Mashber\\") was translated into Hebrew in 1962, into French in 1984, into English by Leonard Wolf in 1987, and into German in 1990. Der Nister appears as one of the main characters in the novel The World to Come (2006) by Dara Horn. The book describes Kahanovich's uneasy friendship with artist Marc Chagall, inside whose frames he hid some of his writings. Adaptations, descriptions, and excerpts from his stories, and those of other Yiddish writers, are included. (Horn makes one fictional change: Der Nister dies almost as soon as arrested, whereas in reality he died the following year, or maybe as late as 1952 according to some sources). ==Selected works== * Gedankn un motivn — lider in proze (\\"Ideas and Motifs — Prose Poems\\"), Vilna, 1907 * Hekher fun der erd (\\"Higher than the Earth\\"), Warsaw, 1910 * Gezang un gebet (\\"Song and Prayer\\"), Kiev, 1912 (collection of songs) * Translation of selected tales from Hans Christian Andersen, 1918 * Mayselekh in ferzn (\\"Stories in Verse\\"), 1918/19 (many editions: Kiev, Warsaw, Berlin) * Gedakht (\\"Imagined\\"), Berlin, 1922/23 (collection of fantastic stories, 2 vols.) * Fun mayne giter (\\"From My Estates\\"), Kiev, 1929 * Hoyptshtet (\\"Capital Cities\\"), Moscow, 1934 * Zeks mayselekh (\\"Six Little Tales\\"), 1939 * Di mishpokhe Mashber (\\"The Family Mashber\\"), Kiev, 1939 (Vol. 1), New York, 1948 (Vol. 2) * Korbones (\\"Victims\\"), Moscow, 1943 * Dertseylungen un eseyen (\\"Stories and Essays\\"), New York, 1957 (posthumous) * Vidervuks (\\"Regeneration\\"), Moscow, 1969 (posthumous) ==References== == Bibliography== * Delphine Bechtel: Der Nister’s Work 1907–1929: A Study of a Yiddish Symbolist.

It is used mostly for biological specimens, but sections of plastics and soft metals can also be prepared. Sections must be very thin because the 50 to 125 kV electrons of the standard electron microscope cannot pass through biological material much thicker than 150 nm. For best resolutions, sections should be from 30 to 60 nm. This is roughly the equivalent to splitting a 0.1 mm-thick human hair into 2,000 slices along its diameter, or cutting a single red blood cell into 100 slices.\\"Electron Microscopy\\", chapter 4, by John J. Bozzola and Lonnie Dee Russell ==Ultramicrotomy process== Ultra-thin sections of specimens are cut using a specialized instrument called an \\"ultramicrotome\\". The ultramicrotome is fitted with either a diamond knife, for most biological ultra-thin sectioning, or a glass knife, often used for initial cuts. There are numerous other pieces of equipment involved in the ultramicrotomy process. Before selecting an area of the specimen block to be ultra-thin sectioned, the technician examines semithin or \\"thick\\" sections range from 0.5 to 2 μm. These thick sections are also known as survey sections and are viewed under a light microscope to determine whether the right area of the specimen is in a position for thin sectioning. \\"Ultra-thin\\" sections from 50 to 100 nm thick are able to be viewed in the TEM. Low magnification of an ultra-thin section (length = 0.5 mm) of a megaspore of Salvinia cucullata (intermediate lens micrograph taken with the ZEISS TEM 9A – \\"flying carpet\\" preparation) Tissue sections obtained by ultramicrotomy are compressed by the cutting force of the knife. In addition, interference microscopy of the cut surface of the blocks reveals that the sections are often not flat. With Epon or Vestopal as embedding medium the ridges and valleys usually do not exceed 0.5 μm in height, i.e., 5–10 times the thickness of ordinary sections (1). A small sample is taken from the specimen to be investigated. Specimens may be from biological matter, like animal or plant tissue, or from inorganic material such as rock, metal, magnetic tape, plastic, film, etc.Micro Star Technologies, diamond knives The sample block is first trimmed to create a block face 1 mm by 1 mm in size. \\"Thick\\" sections (1 μm) are taken to be looked at on an optical microscope. An area is chosen to be sectioned for TEM and the block face is re-trimmed to a size no larger than 0.7 mm on a side. Block faces usually have a square, trapezoidal, rectangular, or triangular shape. Finally, thin sections are cut with a glass or diamond knife using an ultramicrotome and the sections are left floating on water that is held in a boat or trough. The sections are then retrieved from the water surface and mounted on a copper, nickel, gold, or other metal grid. Ideal section thickness for transmission electron microscopy with accelerating voltages between 50kV and 120kV is about 30–100 nm. ==Advances== Cryo ultramicrotome In 1952 Humberto Fernandez Morán introduced cryo ultramicrotomy, which is a similar technique but done at freezing temperatures between −20 and −150°C. Cryo ultramicrotomy can be used to cut ultra-thin frozen biological specimens. One of the advantages over the more \\"traditional\\" ultramicrotomy process is speed, since it should be possible to freeze and section a specimen in 1 to 2 hours. ==References== * Category:Microscopy Category:Electron microscopy Category:Biological techniques and tools ","title":"Ultramicrotomy"},{"id":"3239239","text":"Bagnols may refer to various communes in France: * Bagnols, Puy-de-Dôme * Bagnols, Rhône * Bagnols-en-Forêt, Var * Bagnols-les-Bains, Lozère * Bagnols- sur-Cèze, Gard ","title":"Bagnols"},{"id":"3239262","text":"Amy Mathews (born 29 March 1979) is an Australian television, film and theatre actress.

She has had several roles on other television series including Always Greener, Blue Heelers, Love Bytes, All Saints and the British series Jeopardy. Before landing the role of Rachel Armstrong on Australian soap opera Home and Away, she waited tables until she could make enough money. Mathews played the role of doctor and psychiatrist Rachel Armstrong since the first episode of the 2006 season, until 2010 when she departed the show. The reason she decided to leave was because she wanted to move on and try new projects. The role of Rachel won Mathews the Logie Award for Most Popular New Female Talent in 2007. Following her departure from Home and Away, Mathews made a guest appearances in two episodes of the popular television series Packed to the Rafters. Her most recent guest roles include Rescue: Special Ops and Crownies which stars former Home and Away co-stars Todd Lasance and Indiana Evans. In 2007, Mathews starred in the Australian film Gabriel, in which she had just begun her run on Home and Away while shooting the film. Gabriel is her only film credit. Since leaving Home and Away, she has starred on stage in various plays, and in t.v commercials.

Marino Sanuto or Sanudo the Elder of Torcello ( – 1338) was a Venetian statesman and geographer. He is best known for his lifelong attempts to revive the crusading spirit and movement; with this object he wrote his great work, the Liber Secretorum Fidelium Crucis. ==Life and travels== Marino himself tells us that he had spent the best part of his life in \\"Romania\\", the lands of the Eastern empire; of the Morea he had especially intimate knowledge; he had also visited Cyprus, Rhodes, parts of the Syrian, Cilician and Egyptian coasts, France, Flanders and north Germany, both west and east of Denmark.

A component's thickness affects the constraint conditions at the tip of a crack with thin components having plane stress conditions and thick components having plane strain conditions. Plane strain conditions give the lowest fracture toughness value which is a material property. The critical value of stress intensity factor in mode I loading measured under plane strain conditions is known as the plane strain fracture toughness, denoted K_\\\\text{Ic}. When a test fails to meet the thickness and other test requirements that are in place to ensure plane strain conditions, the fracture toughness value produced is given the designation K_\\\\text{c}. Fracture toughness is a quantitative way of expressing a material's resistance to crack propagation and standard values for a given material are generally available. Slow self-sustaining crack propagation known as stress corrosion cracking, can occur in a corrosive environment above the threshold K_\\\\text{Iscc} and below K_\\\\text{Ic}. Small increments of crack extension can also occur during fatigue crack growth, which after repeated loading cycles, can gradually grow a crack until final failure occurs by exceeding the fracture toughness.

Metals hold the highest values of fracture toughness. Cracks cannot easily propagate in tough materials, making metals highly resistant to cracking under stress and gives their stress–strain curve a large zone of plastic flow. Ceramics have a lower fracture toughness but show an exceptional improvement in the stress fracture that is attributed to their 1.5 orders of magnitude strength increase, relative to metals. The fracture toughness of composites, made by combining engineering ceramics with engineering polymers, greatly exceeds the individual fracture toughness of the constituent materials. == Mechanisms == === Intrinsic mechanisms === Intrinsic toughening mechanisms are processes which act ahead of the crack tip to increase the material's toughness. These will tend to be related to the structure and bonding of the base material, as well as microstructural features and additives to it. Examples of mechanisms include * crack deflection by secondary phases, * crack bifurcation due to fine grain structure * changes in the crack path due to grain boundaries Any alteration to the base material which increases its ductility can also be thought of as intrinsic toughening. ==== Grain boundaries ==== The presence of grains in a material can also affect its toughness by affecting the way cracks propagate. In front of a crack, a plastic zone can be present as the material yields. Beyond that region, the material remains elastic. The conditions for fracture are the most favorable at the boundary between this plastic and elastic zone, and thus cracks often initiate by the cleavage of a grain at that location. At low temperatures, where the material can become completely brittle, such as in a body-centered cubic (BCC) metal, the plastic zone shrinks away, and only the elastic zone exists. In this state, the crack will propagate by successive cleavage of the grains. At these low temperatures, the yield strength is high, but the fracture strain and crack tip radius of curvature are low, leading to a low toughness. At higher temperatures, the yield strength decreases, and leads to the formation of the plastic zone. Cleavage is likely to initiate at the elastic-plastic zone boundary, and then link back to the main crack tip. This is usually a mixture of cleavages of grains, and ductile fracture of grains known as fibrous linkages. The percentage of fibrous linkages increase as temperature increases until the linkup is entirely fibrous linkages. In this state, even though yield strength is lower, the presence of ductile fracture and a higher crack tip radius of curvature results in a higher toughness. ==== Inclusions ==== Inclusions in a material such as a second phase particles can act similar to brittle grains that can affect crack propagation. Fracture or decohesion at the inclusion can either be caused by the external applied stress or by the dislocations generated by the requirement of the inclusion to maintain contiguity with the matrix around it. Similar to grains, the fracture is most likely to occur at the plastic-elastic zone boundary. Then the crack can linkup back to the main crack. If the plastic zone is small or the density of the inclusions is small, the fracture is more likely to directly link up with the main crack tip. If the plastic zone is large, or the density of inclusions is high, additional inclusion fractures may occur within the plastic zone, and linkup occurs by progressing from the crack to the closest fracturing inclusion within the zone. ==== Transformation toughening ==== Transformation toughening is a phenomenon whereby a material undergoes one or more martensitic (displacive, diffusionless) phase transformations which result in an almost instantaneous change in volume of that material. This transformation is triggered by a change in the stress state of the material, such as an increase in tensile stress, and acts in opposition to the applied stress. Thus when the material is locally put under tension, for example at the tip of a growing crack, it can undergo a phase transformation which increases its volume, lowering the local tensile stress and hindering the crack's progression through the material. This mechanism is exploited to increase the toughness of ceramic materials, most notably in Yttria-stabilized zirconia for applications such as ceramic knives and thermal barrier coatings on jet engine turbine blades. === Extrinsic mechanisms === Extrinsic toughening mechanisms are processes which act behind the crack tip to resist its further opening. Examples include * fibre/lamella bridging, where these structures hold the two fracture surfaces together after the crack has propagated through the matrix, * crack wedging from the friction between two rough fracture surfaces, and * microcracking, where smaller cracks form in the material around the main crack, relieving the stress at the crack tip by effectively increasing the material's compliance. == Test methods == Fracture toughness tests are performed to quantify the resistance of a material to failure by cracking. Such tests result in either a single-valued measure of fracture toughness or in a resistance curve. Resistance curves are plots where fracture toughness parameters (K, J etc.) are plotted against parameters characterizing the propagation of crack. The resistance curve or the single-valued fracture toughness is obtained based on the mechanism and stability of fracture. Fracture toughness is a critical mechanical property for engineering applications. There are several types of test used to measure fracture toughness of materials, which generally utilise a notched specimen in one of various configurations. A widely utilized standardized test method is the Charpy impact test whereby a sample with a V-notch or a U-notch is subjected to impact from behind the notch. Also widely used are crack displacement tests such as three-point beam bending tests with thin cracks preset into test specimens before applying load. === Testing requirements === ==== Choice of specimen ==== The ASTM standard E1820 for the measurement of fracture toughness recommends three coupon types for fracture toughness testing, the single-edge bending coupon [SE(B)], the compact tension coupon [C(T)] and the disk-shaped compact tension coupon [DC(T)]. Each specimen configuration is characterized by three dimensions, namely the crack length (a), the thickness (B) and the width (W). The values of these dimensions are determined by the demand of the particular test that is being performed on the specimen. The vast majority of the tests are carried out on either compact or SENB configuration. For the same characteristic dimensions, compact configuration takes a lesser amount of material compared to SENB. ==== Material orientation ==== Orientation of fracture is important because of the inherent non-isotropic nature of most engineering materials. Due to this, there may be planes of weakness within the material, and crack growth along this plane may be easier compared to other direction. Due to this importance ASTM has devised a standardized way of reporting the crack orientation with respect to forging axis. The letters L, T and S are used to denote the longitudinal, transverse and short transverse directions, where the longitudinal direction coincides with forging axis. The orientation is defined with two letters the first one being the direction of principal tensile stress and the second one is the direction of crack propagation. Generally speaking, the lower bound of the toughness of a material is obtained in the orientation where the crack grows in the direction of forging axis. ==== Pre-cracking ==== For accurate results, a sharp crack is required before testing. Machined notches and slots do not meet this criterion. The most effective way of introducing a sufficiently sharp crack is by applying cyclic loading to grow a fatigue crack from a slot. Fatigue cracks are initiated at the tip of the slot and allowed to extend until the crack length reaches its desired value. The cyclic loading is controlled carefully so as to not affect the toughness of the material through strain-hardening. This is done by choosing cyclic loads that produce a far smaller plastic zone compared to plastic zone of the main fracture. For example, according to ASTM E399, the maximum stress intensity Kmax should be no larger than 0.6K_\\\\text{Ic} during the initial stage and less than 0.8K_\\\\text{Ic} when crack approaches its final size. In certain cases grooves are machined into the sides of a fracture toughness specimen so that the thickness of the specimen is reduced to a minimum of 80% of the original thickness along the intended path of crack extensions. The reason is to maintain a straight crack front during R-curve test. The four main standardized tests are described below with KIc and KR tests valid for linear- elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) while J and JR tests valid for elastic- plastic fracture mechanics (EPFM) === Determination of plane strain fracture toughness === When a material behaves in a linear elastic way prior to failure, such that the plastic zone is small compared to the specimen dimension, a critical value of Mode-I stress intensity factor can be an appropriate fracture parameter. This method provides a quantitative measure of fracture toughness in terms of the critical plane strain stress intensity factor. The test must be validated once complete to ensure the results are meaningful. The specimen size is fixed, and must be large enough to ensure plane strain conditions at the crack tip. The specimen thickness affects the degree of constraint at the crack tip which in turn affects the fracture toughness value Fracture toughness decreases with increasing specimen size until a plateau is reached. Specimen size requirements in ASTM E 399 are intended to ensure that K_\\\\text{Ic} measurements correspond to the plane strain plateau by ensuring that the specimen fractures under nominally linear elastic conditions. That is, the plastic zone must be small compared to the specimen cross section. Four specimen configurations are permitted by the current version of E 399: the compact, SE(B), arc-shaped, and disk-shaped specimens. Specimens for K_\\\\text{Ic} tests are usually fabricated with the width W equal to twice the thickness B. They are fatigue pre-cracked so that the crack length/width ratio (a /W) lies between 0.45 and 0.55. Thus, the specimen design is such that all of the key dimensions, a, B, and W−a, are approximately equal. This design results in the efficient use of material, since the standard requires that each of these dimensions must be large compared to the plastic zone. ;Plane-strain fracture toughness testing When performing a fracture toughness test, the most common test specimen configurations are the single edge notch bend (SENB or three-point bend), and the compact tension (CT) specimens. Testing has shown that plane-strain conditions generally prevail when: ::B,a\\\\geq2.5\\\\left(\\\\frac{K_{IC}}{\\\\sigma_\\\\text{YS}}\\\\right)^2 Where: B is the minimum necessary thickness, K_\\\\text{Ic} the fracture toughness of the material and \\\\sigma_\\\\text{YS} is the material yield strength. The test is performed by loading steadily at a rate such that KI increases from 0.55 to 2.75 (MPa\\\\sqrt{m})/s. During the test, the load and the crack mouth opening displacement (CMOD) is recorded and the test is continued till the maximum load is reached. The critical load, PQ is calculated through from the load vs CMOD plot. A provisional toughness KQ is given as ::K_Q=\\\\frac{P_Q}{\\\\sqrt{W}B}f(a/W,...). The geometry factor f(a/W,...) is a dimensionless function of a/W and is given in polynomial form in the E 399 standard. The geometry factor for compact test geometry can be found here. This provisional toughness value is recognized as valid when the following requirements are met: ::min(B,a)>2.5\\\\left(\\\\frac{K_{Q}}{\\\\sigma_\\\\text{YS}}\\\\right)^2and P_{max}\\\\leq 1.1P_Q When a material of unknown fracture toughness is tested, a specimen of full material section thickness is tested or the specimen is sized based on a prediction of the fracture toughness. If the fracture toughness value resulting from the test does not satisfy the requirement of the above equation, the test must be repeated using a thicker specimen. In addition to this thickness calculation, test specifications have several other requirements that must be met (such as the size of the shear lips) before a test can be said to have resulted in a KIC value. When a test fails to meet the thickness and other plain-strain requirements, the fracture toughness value produced is given the designation Kc. Sometimes, it is not possible to produce a specimen that meets the thickness requirement. For example, when a relatively thin plate with high toughness is being tested, it might not be possible to produce a thicker specimen with plane-strain conditions at the crack tip. === Determination of R-curve, K-R === The specimen showing stable crack growth shows an increasing trend in fracture toughness as the crack length increases (ductile crack extension). This plot of fracture toughness vs crack length is called the resistance (R)-curve. ASTM E561 outlines a procedure for determining toughness vs crack growth curves in materials. This standard does not have a constraint over the minimum thickness of the material and hence can be used for thin sheets however the requirements for LEFM must be fulfilled for the test to be valid. The criteria for LEFM essentially states that in-plane dimension has to be large compared to the plastic zone. There is a misconception about the effect of thickness on the shape of R curve. It is hinted that for the same material thicker section fails by plane strain fracture and shows a single-valued fracture toughness, the thinner section fails by plane stress fracture and shows the rising R-curve. However, the main factor that controls the slope of R curve is the fracture morphology not the thickness. In some material section thickness changes the fracture morphology from ductile tearing to cleavage from thin to thick section, in which case the thickness alone dictates the slope of R-curve. There are cases where even plane strain fracture ensues in rising R-curve due to \\"microvoid coalescence\\" being the mode of failure. The most accurate way of evaluating K-R curve is taking presence of plasticity into account depending on the relative size of the plastic zone. For the case of negligible plasticity, the load vs displacement curve is obtained from the test and on each point the compliance is found. The compliance is reciprocal of the slope of the curve that will be followed if the specimen is unloaded at a certain point, which can be given as the ratio of displacement to load for LEFM. The compliance is used to determine the instantaneous crack length through the relationship given in the ASTM standard. The stress intensity should be corrected by calculating an effective crack length. ASTM standard suggests two alternative approaches. The first method is named Irwin's plastic zone correction. Irwin's approach describes the effective crack length a_\\\\text{eff} to be ::a_\\\\text{eff}=a+\\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi}\\\\left(\\\\frac{K}{\\\\sigma_{YS}}\\\\right)^2 Irwin's approach leads to an iterative solution as K itself is a function of crack length. The other method, namely the secant method, uses the compliance-crack length equation given by ASTM standard to calculate effective crack length from an effective compliance. Compliance at any point in Load vs displacement curve is essentially the reciprocal of the slope of the curve that ensues if the specimen is unloaded at that point. Now the unloading curve returns to the origin for linear elastic material but not for elastic plastic material as there is a permanent deformation. The effective compliance at a point for the elastic plastic case is taken as the slope of the line joining the point and origin (i.e the compliance if the material was an elastic one). This effective compliance is used to get an effective crack growth and the rest of the calculation follows the equation ::K_I=\\\\frac{P}{\\\\sqrt{W}B} f(a_\\\\text{eff}/W,...) The choice of plasticity correction is factored on the size of plastic zone. ASTM standard covering resistance curve suggests using Irwin's method is acceptable for small plastic zone and recommends using Secant method when crack-tip plasticity is more prominent. Also since the ASTM E 561 standard does not contain requirements on the specimen size or maximum allowable crack extension, thus the size independence of the resistance curve is not guaranteed. Few studies show that the size dependence is less detected in the experimental data for the Secant method. === Determination of JIC === Strain energy release rate per unit fracture surface area is calculated by J-integral method which is a contour path integral around the crack tip where the path begins and ends on either crack surfaces. J-toughness value signifies the resistance of the material in terms of amount of stress energy required for a crack to grow. JIC toughness value is measured for elastic-plastic materials. Now the single-valued JIC is determined as the toughness near the onset of the ductile crack extension (effect of strain hardening is not important). The test is performed with multiple specimen loading each of the specimen to various levels and unloading. This gives the crack mouth opening compliance which is to be used to get crack length with the help of relationships given in ASTM standard E 1820, which covers the J-integral testing. Another way of measuring crack growth is to mark the specimen with heat tinting or fatigue cracking. The specimen is eventually broken apart and the crack extension is measured with the help of the marks. The test thus performed yields several Load vs Crack Mouth Opening Displacement (CMOD) curve, which are used to calculate J as following:- ::J=J_{el}+J_{pl} The linear elastic J is calculated using J_{el}=\\\\frac{K^2\\\\left(1- u^2\\\\right)}{E}and K is determined from K_I=\\\\frac{P}{\\\\sqrt{WBB_N}} f(a/W,...)where BN is the net thickness for side- grooved specimen and equal to B for not side-grooved specimen The elastic plastic J is calculated using ::J_{pl}=\\\\frac{\\\\eta A_{pl}}{B_Nb_o} Where \\\\eta=2 for SENB specimen bo is initial ligament length given by the difference between width and initial crack length APl is the plastic area under the load- displacement curve. Specialized data reduction technique is used to get a provisional JQ. The value is accepted if the following criterion is met ::\\\\min(B,b_o)\\\\geq\\\\frac{25J_Q}{\\\\sigma_\\\\text{YS}} === Determination of tear resistance (Kahn tear test) === The tear test (e.g. Kahn tear test) provides a semi-quantitative measure of toughness in terms of tear resistance. This type of test requires a smaller specimen, and can, therefore, be used for a wider range of product forms. The tear test can also be used for very ductile aluminium alloys (e.g. 1100, 3003), where linear elastic fracture mechanics do not apply. === Standard test methods === A number of organizations publish standards related to fracture toughness measurements, namely ASTM, BSI, ISO, JSME. *ASTM C1161 Test Method for Flexural Strength of Advanced Ceramics at Ambient Temperature *ASTM E399 Test Method for Plane-strain Fracture Toughness of Metallic Materials *ASTM E740 Practice for Fracture Testing with Surface- Crack Tension Specimens *ASTM E1820 Standard Test Method for Measurement of Fracture Toughness *ASTM E1823 Terminology Relating to Fatigue and Fracture Testing *ISO 12135 Metallic materials — Unified method of test for the determination of quasistatic fracture toughness *ISO 28079:2009, the Palmqvist method, used to determine the fracture toughness for cemented carbides.ISO 28079:2009, Palmqvist toughness test, Retrieved 22 January 2016 ==See also== *Brittle-ductile transition zone *Charpy impact test *Impact (mechanics) *Izod impact strength test *Puncture resistance *Shock (mechanics) *Three point flexural fracture toughness testing *Toughness of ceramics by indentation *Palmqvist method == References == == Further reading == * Anderson, T.

The result of this journey was the publication of his Itinerario per la terraferma veneziana and a collection of Latin inscriptions. === Adulthood === A page handwritten by Marin SanudoSanuto was elected a member of the Maggior Consiglio when only twenty years old (the legal age was twenty-five) and he became a senator in 1498; he noted down everything that was said and done in those assemblies and obtained permission to examine the secret archives of the state. He collected a fine library, which was especially rich in manuscripts and chronicles both Venetian and foreign, including the famous Altino Chronicle, a collection of legends about early Venetian history which served as a foundation of Venetian historiography, and became the friend of all the learned men of the day, Aldo Manuzio dedicating to him his editions of the works of Angelo Poliziano and of the poems of Ovid. It was a great grief to Sanuto when Andrea Navagero was appointed the official historian to continue the history of the republic from the point where Marco Antonio Sabellico left off, and a still greater mortification when, Navagero having died in 1529 without executing his task, Pietro Bembo was appointed to succeed him. Finally in 1531 the value of his work was recognized by the senate, which granted him a pension of 150 gold ducats per annum. He died in 1536. Sanuto played a role in placing the Venetian Jews in the first ever Jewish ghetto, as he stated in a speech in 1515, a year before the ghetto's establishment: \\"I do not want to omit to relate an evil practice resulting with the continuing contact with these Jews, who reside in great numbers in the cities. Formerly, they were not seen outside their houses from palm Sunday until after Easter. Now till yesterday they were going about and it is a very bad thing, and no one says anything to them, since we need them due to the wars and therefore do what they want.\\" 450px == Works == His chief works are the following: * Itinerario per la terraferma veneziana, published by M. Rawdon Brown in 1847 * I commentari delta guerra di Ferrara, an account of the war between the Venetians and Ercole I d' Este, published in Venice in 1829 * La Spedizione di Carlo VIII.(MS. in the Louvre) * Le Vite dei Dogi, published in vol. xxii. of Muratori's Rerum Italicarum Scriptores (1733) * Diarii, his most important work, which covers the period from 1 January 1496 to June 1533, and fills 58 volumes. The publication of these records was begun by Rinaldo Fulin in 1879, in collaboration with Federigo Stefani, Guglielmo Berchet, and Niccold Barozzi; the last volume was published in Venice in 1903. Owing to the relations of the Venetian republic with the whole of Europe and the East it is practically a universal chronicle. It is considered an invaluable source of information on that period. == Personal life == He was briefly married to Cecilia Priuli, but the marriage had no issue.

The nearest towns with railway stations are Tindivanam, 28 km away, and Thiruvannamalai, 29 km away. Senji is located between three hills covering a perimeter of 3 km. Gingee Fort Hill Gingee is famous for its Senji Fort, a popular tourist attraction. The Kon dynasty laid the foundations for the Senji Fort in 1190 AD. The fort was later built by the Chola dynasty in the 13th century. In 1638, Senji came under the control of Bijapur Sultanate from Vijayanagar. In 1677, some small portion was under the control of local Maratha king Shivaji. In 1690, it came under the Mughals, when it became the headquarters of Arcot. It changed hands to the French in 1750, and then to the British in 1762. During this time, many sculptural aspects of Senji were shifted to Pondicherry by the French. To visit Senji fort, guides are available from archaeological office which is on the way to the fort. The office is open for visitors from 9:00 to 17:00 (9am to 5pm). The fee for visitors and tourists for visiting the fort is Rs.10. ==History== The founding of the Kon dynasty provides the launching of Senji as a fortified royal center. The Senji country then came under the rule of the Hoysalas in the later part of the 13th and in the first half of the 14th century. From the Hoysalas it passed on, by relatively easy efforts, into the hands of the first rulers of Vijayanagara empire. The Vijayanagar dominion gradually expanded over South India and divided the administration into three important provinces, which were under the control of Nayaks. These were the Nayaks of Madurai, Nayaks of Tanjore and Nayaks of Senji. Information about the Gingee Senji and their rule is very scanty. It is said that Tupakula Krishnappa Nayaka (1490 to 1521) of a Chandragiri family was the founder of the Nayaka line of Senji kings.Velcheru Narayana Rao, David Shulman.

The Political Economy of Commerce: Southern India 1500-1650, page 304 mentions: \\"Achyutappa, it is generally believed, belonged to the Balija Chetti mercantile community, originally of Telugu extraction, but settled in the Tamil region as a part of the extensive migratory movement from the Andhra to the Tamil regions that began c.1350 and continued into our period.\\"Sanjay Subrahmanyam. Improvising empire: Portuguese trade and settlement in the Bay of Bengal, 1500–1700, page 206 mentions: \\"..perhaps as early as 1608, the VOC's factors had maintained close contact with a family of Achyutappa and his brother Chinnanna, but also two nephews, Koneri and Sesadra.\\" He seems to have ruled gloriously all over the coast from Nellore down to the Coleroon up to 1521 AD. Under the Nayaks the forts were strengthened and the town was greatly enlarged. Krishnagiri Fort Hill The last Nayak of Senji was forced to surrender to the Bijapur army towards the end of December 1649 AD. The booty acquired by the Mohammedan rulers of Bijapur was 20 crores of rupees in cash and jewels. Senji assumed a new and enhanced strategic importance under the Bijapur governors. Bijapur was in possession of the fortress of Senji till 1677 AD, when Chatrapati Shivaji, the son of Shahaji fell upon it in his Carnatic expedition. The Marathas greatly strengthened and fortified its defences. The Mughals were then able to capture the fort of Senji in the Carnatic from Rajaram the King of the Marathas, early in 1698, after a siege of seven years. Zulfikar Khan, the son of Asad Khan, the Grand Vizir in the court of Aurangazeb, was in command of the siege operation of Senji and of its governor till he left the Carnatic after about a year from its fall. After that Aurangazeb, granted a mansab of 2,500 rank and jagir of 12 lakhs to Raja Swarup Singh, a Bundela Rajput chieftain, along with the killedari (Fort Commandership) of Senji in 1700 AD. Raja Swarup Singh died of old age in 1714 AD. His arrears of payments due to the faujdari amounted to 70 lakhs, being a defaulter for ten years. The Nawab of Arcot reported this matter to the Badshah (Mughal Emperor) at Delhi. Hearing about the death of his father, Desingh, the son of Raja Swarup Singh, started for Senji from Bundelkhand, his ancestral home. On arriving at Senji, Desingh assumed the government of Senji after performing the last rites of his father. Aurangazeb had granted a firman to his father and Desingh took formal possession of his father's jaghir on ground of his hereditary right. Desingh did not receive a warm welcome from the Mughal officers. The Nawab of Arcot, Sadatullah Khan, who attempted to dispossess Desingh, pleaded that the firman was not valid. When Payya Ramakrishna, who was his secretary, informed him of the legal necessity of getting the firman renewed by the new Emperor before assuming the jaghir, Desingh replied that he had got the firman of Aurangazeb and that he need not apply to anybody else. In fact after regaining the fort from Marathas, Aurangzeb had first appointed Nawab Daud Khan as the deputy subahdar of the Deccan. Nawab Daud Khan removed his headquarters from Senji to the town of Arcot, as he believed that the place was not healthy. This diminished the importance of Senji. While shifting his headquarters, Daud Khan appointed Sadatullah Khan as his Diwan and Faujdar in 1708. Sadatullah Khan later became the Nawab of the two Carnatics in 1713, under Nizam-Ul-Mulk. He was the regular and acknowledged Nawab of the Carnatic between the years 1710 and 1732 AD. After the death of Raja Swarup Singh he renewed the demand for the arrears of revenue with his son Raja Desingh. This led to a battle between the two, which unfortunately ended in the death of the young and valiant Rajput, Desingh on 3 October 1714. He struggled at the young age of 22, against the powerful Nawab Sadatulla Khan of Arcot in a struggle that was hopeless from the outset (Desingh's army consisted of only 350 horses and 500 troopers, while the Nawab's army had 8,000 horsemen and 10,000 sepoys). The ballets are sung in and around Senji till date about his bravery. However, the fortress of Senji lost its pre-eminent position and political importance within a few years of the extinction of the Rajput rule.Throne in Krishnagiri Fort Subsequently, the two European rival powers in India, the English and the French, got themselves involved in the internal quarrels and fights and the French won for themselves the Senji fortress on the 11th Sept., 1750, under the initiative of Bussy. They took good care to secure the fort by a strong garrison, which was well supported with artillery and ammunition. Senji remained firmly in French possession until after the fall of Pondichéry to Sir Eyre Coote in January 1761. The English commander was Captain Stephen Smith. With the fall of Senji the French lost their last possession in the Carnatic. Throne in Gingee Fort Hill Senji regained its political importance, for the last time in its fateful history, in 1780 AD, when Haidar Ali, helped by some able French Officers, invaded Carnatic with a force of 90,000 men. Haidar's men appeared before the fortress and easily carried it by their assault in November 1780. The English re-conquered it at the close of the second Mysore war from Tippu Sultan in 1799. After that Senji had been free from the ravages and anarchy of war, but subject to desolation and decay. During the frequent Indo-French Wars, the British resident wanted the Fort and The Fortification to be demolished. Luckily his suggestion was not accepted and the Fort remains for us to experience and relive the history. The presence of Muslim rulers in Senji is evident from the inhabitants of a nearby village called Minambur, where the Urdu speaking Navaitha Muslims living with their unique culture and tribes such as Shakir, Koken, Bhanday Bhonday, Choudary, Pappa, Aghalay, Hazari, Amberkhani, Sayeed etc. ==Geography== Senji is located at .Falling Rain Genomics, Inc - Gingee It has an average elevation of 92 metres (301 ft).
