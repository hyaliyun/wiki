Synthetic biopolymer of different chemical nature have been obtained, including polysaccharides, glycoproteins, peptides and proteins, polyhydroxoalkanoates, polyisoprenes. == Synthesis of biopolymer == The high molecular weight of biopolymers make their synthesis inherently laborious. Further challenges can arise from specific spatial arrangement adopted by the natural biopolymer, which may be vital for its properties/activity but not easily reproducible in the synthetic copy. Despite this, chemical approaches to obtain biopolymer are highly desirable to overcome issues arising from low abundance of the target biopolymer in Nature, the need for cumbersome isolation processes or high batch-to-batch variability or inhomogeneity of the naturally-sourced species. === Examples of synthetic biopolymers obtained by chemical routes === *cis-1,4-polyisoprene (synthetic analogue of rubber) and trans-1,4-polyisoprene (synthetic analogue of gutta percha) are obtained by coordination polymerisation using suitable Ziegler-Natta catalysts. * Polyhydroxoalkanoates such as poly(3-hydroxobutyrate), poly(hydroxovaleric acid) etc. obtained by polycondensation and polyaddition. Low-molecular weight polylactide and other polyglycolides can also be obtained by chemical synthesis. *Oligonucleotides and polynucleotides (DNA or RNA) can be obtain by chemical synthesis through a variety of established approaches. *A variety of proteins have been obtained by chemical synthesis. A successful approach relies on native chemical ligation, which achieves the synthesis of proteins by linking shorter unprotected peptides. This strategy allowed to obtain, amongst many others, proteins such as insulin-like growth factor 1, the precursor of Aequorea green fluorescent protein and the influenza A virus M2 membrane protein. === Examples of biopolymers obtained by chemoenzymatic routes === * Polyhydroxoalkanoates and polyesters obtained by enzyme-assisted esterification using lipases. * Heparin, heparan sulfate and other glycosaminoglycans and plant glycans. *Polysaccharides such as cellulose, amylose, chitin and derivatives *Natural and non-natural polynucleotides can be successfully obtained by enzyme-assisted synthesis using ligase- or polymerase-based approaches and template-assisted polymerisation. Human-made biopolymers obtained through approaches that involve genetic engineering or recombinant DNA technology are different from synthetic biopolymers and should be referred to as artificial biopolymer (e.g., artificial protein, artificial polynucleotide, etc.). == Applications of synthetic biopolymers == As their natural analogues, synthetic biopolymers find applications in numerous fields, including materials for commodities, drug delivery, tissue engineering, therapeutic and diagnostic applications. == References == Category:Biomolecules Category:Polymers ","title":"Synthetic biopolymer"},{"id":"61243381","text":"Mien van Bree Wilhelmina Elizabeth (Mien) van Bree (24 April 1915 - 4 August 1983) was a Dutch cyclist. She is considered a pioneer of women's cycling in the Netherlands. ==Early years== Van Bree was the fourth of five children in a horticultural family, the daughter of Adrianus van Bree (1878‚Äì1959) and Elizabeth Hendrika van Beek (1884‚Äì1952). She grew up in the Tramstraat, in Loosduinen. Cycling was an early hobby for her. To train and test her speed, she chased after the buses. Her talent was noticed by neighbor Piet Moeskops, five-time sprint world champion (1921‚Äì1926). His compliments motivated her to further develop her cycling talent. In 1931 she founded, together with some girlfriends, the Hague women's cyclist club Vooruitgang Is Ons Streven (VIOS), one of the first Dutch women's cycling clubs. In the Netherlands in the 1930s, it was rejected that girls got on a racing bike, but Mien van Bree didn't like that. == Career == Since the Dutch Cycling Union did not allow bicycle races for women, Van Bree moved to Belgium, where women could race. In addition, she cycled early in the morning from Loosduinen to Belgium, to ride a race in the afternoon. She participated in sprint, long distance, couple and tandem races on the track. In 1934 she became third during the world cycling championship and in the years 1935-1937 she finished second. She was always beaten by the Belgian Elvire De Bruyne from Erembodegem. Van Bree won her first victory in 1937 during the European Cycling Championships. In 1938, after a race of one hundred kilometers in Rocourt, she became world champion. She also extended her European title. A year later, she also extended her world title. The outbreak of the Second World War marked the end of her cycling career. == Later life == Van Bree worked as a psychiatric nursing assistant. After the death of her mother in 1952, she cared for her father until his death in 1959. On August 4, 1983, she was found dead at her home at the age of 68. == Legacy == In 2015 (her hundredth year of birth), the municipality of The Hague named a cycle path in Loosduinen after her: the \\"Mien van Breepad\\".

During this time, lacking a studio to work in, she sought something meaningful to occupy her time, and became aware of the plight of Bosnian women during and in the aftermath of the Bosnian War, many of whom suffered harm, ranging from rape as a weapon of war, rape by the men returning from the front, and human trafficking. This was Stern Levi's entrance into activism for women from oppressed groups or victims of violence, and upon her return to Israel was determined to continue along this path, and began volunteering at the Tel Aviv Sexual Assault Crisis Center. == Activism for Women  Tel Aviv Sexual Assault Crisis Center === In 1997, Stern Levi began volunteering at the Tel Aviv Sexual Assault Crisis Center. Within a year, she was recruited into a professional position, and for a period of 16 years, Stern Levi was the volunteer network coordinator, managing a group of some 200 volunteers, and responsible for intake, training and schedules. Stern Levi is one of the founders of the Testimony Tribunal of Women Victims of Sexual Assault project. The idea behind the tribunal is based on other people's tribunals in the world that were established by women when they realized that the mechanisms of law and government do not serve the needs and goals of women on issues of sexual violence, such as the 1976 International Tribunal on Crimes against Women. The tribunals are not official bodies and have no enforcement power; they are designed to raise awareness of issues that are neglected by official systems and media, as well as to strengthen solidarity between women victims of violence and other crimes. === Turning the Tables === In 2011, Stern Levi left the Crisis Center and turned to other areas of activism for women.◊®◊ê◊ô◊ï◊ü ◊¢◊ù ◊ê◊ô◊®◊ô◊° ◊©◊ò◊®◊ü ◊ú◊ï◊ô, 2018 Together with Lilach Tzur, who was a volunteer at the Crisis Center, she established an organization called Turning the Tables, a vocational training project, a business incubator and a social business for trafficked women and those exiting the cycles of addiction and prostitution. The organization's studios provide centers of study for sewing, fashion, branding, digital marketing and business development, and accompaniment to women seeking access to legal rights, rehabilitation and assistance in various aspects of life. In 2013, a permanent studio was opened in Tel Aviv, and two years later, the Haifa branch was launched. === Her Academy === Her Academy was founded by Stern Levi and Tal Hamoui Granot in 2016. The organization offers vocational training for women seeking to return to the workforce after years in prostitution and dealing with its corollary issues of addiction, poverty, marginalization, ill health, depression and so on. The school aims to provide all that is needed to enable the women to integrate into workplaces and earn a living, which includes more than just practical training, but also empowerment and support. The courses are conducted by business owners and professionals on a voluntary basis, in a framework that enables them to contribute directly to the empowerment of socially and economically disadvantaged women. One of the principles of the activity is the \\"eye-level encounter\\", recognizing the special needs of the women participating as a result of the damages of prostitution, including problems of concentration, difficulty in persistence and low self-esteem, but addressing their needs as peers, and not from a position of superiority. The college's approach has been recognized as unique in the world, because it also sees the teachers as students of the phenomena of prostitution, and the students as a source of inspiration and knowledge, and all those involved as ambassadors of change and consciousness-raising in society, and of the struggle to break down stigmas and harmful stereotypes. === Additional activities === In 2014, Stern Levi initiated an action aimed at the Tel Aviv municipality, after it claimed that the distribution of prostitution calling cards in the streets of Tel Aviv was a police problem, whereas the police refused to enforce laws against their distribution. Together with activist Reut Guy, she led a project to collect prostitution cards from the city's streets, which were then piled up at a protest rally in front of the municipality building, in order to demand that the mayor take care of the matter. Another initiative Stern Levi launched was creation of the Women's Professional Service Network, a directory of women professionals, focused particularly on the fields of home services and maintenance, such as electricians, plumbers, gardeners, carpenters, home repair and handywomen, locksmiths, painters, and other areas in which women are a tiny minority, such as taxi drivers and movers. A major impetus for the project was a case in which a woman was raped by a serviceman who entered her home, and thus Stern Levi was inspired by the dual goals of empowering women in gender non-traditional jobs and enabling women to maximize their physical security. In 2008, Stern Levi was chosen by the Bat Shalom organization as a speaking representative at the International Conference in honor of International Women's Day in Madrid, in the section Women Against Occupation, in which representatives from Colombia, Cuba and the French feminist organization Ni Putes Ni Soumises participated. In 2009 she developed a curriculum for providing counseling and support to activists against Israel's military occupation of Palestine. In 2009, Stern Levi was one of the featured subjects in Guy Davidi's documentary Women Defying Barriers, about the attempts of four Israeli Jewish and Palestinian women to meet, under the shadow of Israel's attack on Gaza in 2008. Stern Levi guides women's empowerment groups, and since 2016, also leads gender consciousness groups for homosexual men. She is a frequent lecturer on feminist subjects, in particular the representations of women in media and advertising. She is active in protests on various issues, from femicide, to racism against Ethiopian Jews, to solidarity with Gaza. == Art == Stern Levi worked as a painter in her own studio and as an art teacher for many years. In addition to her work as an artist, she founded an art studio for refugees and residents of the distressed Shapira neighborhood in Tel Aviv between 2008-2011. Between April and July 2007, Stern Levi exhibited a solo exhibition of her work at the Beit Achoti Gallery. A self-portrait of hers is included in the award-winning manuscript by Tal Dekel, on discrimination against old women in art. == Awards == In 2017, Stern Levi and Hamoui Granot won the Yaffa London Yaari Foundation Award for the establishment and management of Her Academy. In the reasoning for the award, the committee cited the two women's varied work and activities, and described Her Academy as \\"providing a unique framework of vocational training with courses in a variety of professional fields, such as: computer skills and website development, confectionery and cookery, childcare, fashion sales, dog- care, and bicycle maintenance.\\" In February 2018, Stern Levi was awarded the Sussman-JDC Award for Excellence in Social Action for her activities within the framework of Her Academy, in the category of preventing abuse of oppressed and marginalized populations. == Personal life == Stern Levi is the eldest of three daughters of George Stern, born in Austria, who was sent to Glasgow, Scotland, as part of the Kindertransport during World War II, and who grew up in Scotland and England; and Dvora Nachmias, who was born in Israel, and was one of 13 children in her family. Dvora's brother is the writer and Ladino typographer, Ben Zion Nachmias. Stern Levi has two adult children with cultural historian Dror K. Levi, and is a grandmother of one. Since 2004, Stern Levi lives with her same-sex partner. == See also == * Prostitution * Sex trafficking * Rape crisis centers * Coalition of Women for Peace == References == == External links == * Her Academy - official website * Tel Aviv Sexual Assault Crisis Center * Testimony Tribunal of Women Victims of Sexual Assault * Changing the Conversation, Changing Lives, Nancy Strichman, Times of Israel Category:Israeli feminists Category:1953 births Category:Living people Category:Israeli directors Category:LGBT rights activists from Israel Category:Israeli human rights activists Category:Israeli women's rights activists Category:LGBT people from Israel Category:Tel Aviv University alumni ","title":"Iris Stern Levi"},{"id":"61243470","text":"Plicofollis magatensis is a species of catfish in the family Ariidae.

After service with the United States Army in World War II, he joined the USAF in 1947. He helped establish the Eastern Test Range at Cape Canaveral, Florida, was project officer for the SM-62 Snark cruise missile, helped initiate the WS-117L military satellite program, worked on the SAMOS reconnaissance satellite, commanded the Air Force Satellite Control Facility, and was director of the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) Project A. ==Early life and career== William Gregg King Jr. was born in Topeka, Kansas, on 14 December 1918. He graduated from Dodge City High School in 1937, and entered Kansas State University where he received military training with the Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC). King's education was interrupted in 1941 by World War II, when he was commissioned through the ROTC as a second lieutenant in the United States Army Coast Artillery Corps and called up for active duty. During the war he served as an antiaircraft artillery officer on Guam, Leyte and Okinawa. ==Postwar military career== After the war, King completed interrupted studies at the University of Kansas, from which he graduated with his Bachelor of Science degree in engineering in January 1946. He accepted a regular Army commission in United States Army Corps of Engineers, and was a group commander at the Aviation Engineers Training School at Fort Francis E. Warren in Wyoming. He transferred to the United States Air Force when it became a separate service in 1947. King completed a training course on guided missiles at Fort Bliss, Texas, and was assigned to the newly formed Joint Long Range Proving Ground at Patrick Air Force Base in Florida. He was involved in the exploration and surveys of the islands where downrange stations were subsequently established as part of the Eastern Test Range at Cape Canaveral, Florida, and for a time was the station commander of the Grand Bahama Auxiliary Air Force Base. King entered the University of Chicago, which awarded him a Master of Business Administration degree in research and development management in 1954. He joined the Air Research and Development Command at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio in 1955, where he was initially engaged in writing the systems requirements for a medium-range, tactical guided missile. King read a report from RAND Corporation on reconnaissance satellites, and became convinced that such capabilities would become feasible in the near future. He was involved in the creation of a space program office at Wright-Patterson which became known as the Advanced Reconnaissance Satellite Program Office. As its project officer he briefed the Secretary of the Air Force, and convinced him to provide $2 million (equivalent to $ in ) for systems concept studies. King was a member of the selection committee which chose Lockheed Corporation as the contractor for the WS-117L military satellite program. Major General Thomas F. Deppe (left) applauds at the unveiling of the Brigadier General William G. King trophy for the command's best systems wing. King (right) and his wife Mary are seeing the trophy for the first time. In 1957, King became the weapons systems project officer for the SM-62 Snark intercontinental range surface-to-surface cruise missile, and he oversaw its deployment at Presque Isle Air Force Base in Maine. In July 1959 he joined the Space Systems Division in Los Angeles, where he worked in the project office of the SAMOS reconnaissance satellite, which became the Office of Special Projects of the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) in 1961. He became the Deputy Director, Special Projects in the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force in March 1962, a position he held until September 1966, when he became the commander of the Air Force Satellite Control Facility, the headquarters of the worldwide tracking network, at Los Angeles Air Force Station in Sunnyvale, California. In August 1967, King became the assistant deputy chief of staff for operations of the Air Force Systems Command at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland. He was promoted to brigadier general in 1968, and returned to the West Coast in January 1969 as assistant to the director of the Office of Special Projects, NRO Program A, the component of the NRO responsible for USAF satellites. He became Program A director in July that year, a post he held until his retirement on 31 March 1971. ==Honors, awards and legacy== King's military decorations include the Air Force Distinguished Service Medal, Legion of Merit with oak leaf cluster, Bronze Star Medal, and Air Force Commendation Medal with oak leaf cluster. He was honored as a space pioneer in 1989 and 1997, receiving honors from the Smithsonian Institution in 1989, and by the Air Force Space Command in 1997. The Brigadier General William G.

One of her first working experiences was with Karl Lagerfeld at Chanel in Paris. Back in Rome she entered the family firm becoming Accessories Creative Director of the Fendissime young line and also Fendi Shoe Designer, a position she maintained after the company was sold to the French group LVMH. While still loving her work very much, after some time she started feeling uneasy at the idea that every collection and the hard work behind it was doomed to become old right after its presentation. In 2003 she therefore decided to leave the family firm to dedicate herself to nature and the environment, a passion inherited in childhood from her father. ==Carmina Campus== She bought a country estate of about 430 acres in Northern Rome, I Casali del Pino, and while converting the farm to organic cultivation she became increasingly involved with environmental issues and creative reuse of wasted materials. Enlightened by this new awareness she created in 2006 her sustainable fashion and design brand Carmina Campus,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1024.2721&rep;=rep1&type;=pdf that produces high-end bags, accessories and design objects with discarded materials and the manufacturing skills of Italian artisans. In 2009 she started a collaboration with the International Trade Centre (ITC), a UN - WTO agency that works in developing countries creating job opportunities in many industries. The program involved disadvantaged women's communities in Kenya and Uganda for the production of a special Carmina Campus bag line entirely made in Africa.https://search.proquest.com/openview/ee1b75ced7eea122f3f9e636cff78148/1?pq- origsite=gscholar&cbl;=47429 The aim was to provide the workers with professional know-how in order to favor the creation of independent micro- entrepreneurs. She also collaborated with Socially MadeinItaly, an Italian non-profit organization that operates in Italian prisons, to support a joint rehabilitation program involving the production of a special Carmina Campus bag collection made in prison hubs that was first launched in February 2015. The project was certified by Italy's Ministry of Justice and initially involved four prison hubs that later became eleven. In December 2015 the project was presented in Palermo, Sicily, and then made available to the public in a store confiscated from the Mafia. She was among the supporters of The Circle, the non-profit organization created in 2012 by Annie Lennox to promote and finance projects in favor of disadvantaged women and was among the co-founders of its spinoff, The Circle Italia. == Awards== * 2010 Anter Award as Sustainable Fashion Entrepreneur, Florence * 2011 World Fashion Grand Prize for Ethical Fashion Design created by Fashion4Development Program, Seoul * 2012 Excellence in Ethical Business, Dallas * 2013 Marisa Bellisario Award for Art and Design, Rome * 2013 \\"Chi√®ChiAward\\" Social Commitement Award, Milan * 2017 Social Laureate Award created by Italy's Camera Nazionale della Moda and Ecoage, Milan * 2017 ADI Social Design Award, Milan ==Further reading== *Black, Kate (2015), Magnifeco: Your head-to-Toe Guide to Ethical fashion and non-toxic beauty, New Society Publisher, p. 185, *Ceppa, Clara (2014),Spreading the culture of a sustainable manufacturing of eco-fashion products.

His contributions were primarily in green and white colors, per her direction. Over the next five years, Pearson visited twice a year; in 1999 he appointed his student Stuart Barfoot to continue the work under his guidance.

One of Eaton's self- confessed role models as a child was Spock, due to his rational approach to problem solving. She was also a talented pianist, having played since the age of eight. As an undergraduate, Eaton was torn between a career as a biologist, a comparative literature professor, or a mathematician. The deciding factor was a course that was taught from primary literature instead of a textbook, sparking an enthusiasm for biological research. Eaton completed a B.S. in biology at Brown University in 1981 before earning a Ph.D. in microbiology at University of California, Los Angeles in 1988. Her thesis, entitled Molecular analysis of an immunoglobulin heavy chain promoter, was completed under the supervision of Kathryn Calame. She was awarded the Sydney C. Rittenberg Award for Distinguished Academic Achievement in Microbiology by the Association of Academic Women in 1988 for her doctoral work. == Career and research == Eaton began her research career working on immunoglobulin heavy chain genes at University of California, Los Angeles, in the laboratory of Kathryn Calame. In 1988, Eaton switched fields to developmental biology, investigating how cells obtain their tissue identities in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, while in the group of Thomas B. Kornberg at University of California, San Francisco.Eaton group webpage at TU Dresden, accessed on July 9th 2019. Eaton moved to Germany in 1993 to work at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory in Heidelberg in the group of Kai Simons, where she combined her expertise in microbiology and developmental biology to investigate how the cytoskeleton helps cells attain their polarity in tissues, using the fruit fly as a model system. In 2000, Eaton became one of the founding members of the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics in Dresden, Germany, where her group investigated how signaling molecules and mechanical properties of cells act together to shape tissues in the fruit fly. In 2015, she became professor of developmental cell biology of invertebrates at the TU Dresden. == Awards and honors == * 1977: New York State Regents Scholar * 1988: Association of Academic Women, Sydney C.

She teaches at the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi. ==Background and education== Dwivedi is originally from Allahabad. Her mother is Sunitha Dwivedi and her father, Rakesh Dwivedi, practices as a senior lawyer for the Supreme Court of India. She received her Bachelor of Arts degree from Lady Shri Ram College, Delhi and her Master's degree from St. Stephen's College. She pursued her M.Phil from University of Delhi and went on to receive her doctorate from Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi. When she was a student in 2006, Dwivedi co-organised a conference on \\"the state of philosophy in India\\" in Delhi School of Economics. She was \\"exiled to silence\\" as a result of questioning the way philosophy was practiced in India. ==Philosophical work== Dwivedi is currently an associate professor at Department of Humanities & Social Sciences, IIT Delhi. She had earlier taught at St. Stephen's College from 2003 to 2004 and at Dept. of English, Delhi University from January 2011 to April 2012. She was also a visiting scholar at Centre for Fictionality Studies, Aarhus University in 2013 and 2014. She is a member of the Theory Committee of the International Comparative Literature Association along with Robert J. C. Young, Stefan Willer and others. === School of thought === Dwivedi said that philosophy is a disruptive practice following from the Socratic model, \\"philosophy would be the disruption of every given 'way of life' to be understood as unexamined life\\". Following from it there is \\"a necessary relation between philosophy and politics\\". In an interview conducted by Ad√®le Van Reeth for France Culture at the UNESCO headquarters Dwivedi stated that one must not recognize tradition as an adjective of philosophical practice. Her work has a relation to the school of deconstruction. Divya Dwivedi is opposed to postcolonial theory and subaltern studies. In an interview with Mediapart Dwivedi said that postcolonial theory and Hindu nationalism are two versions of the same theory, and that they are both upper caste political projects. Dwivedi noted that in the field of feminism postcolonial theory remains an upper caste theoretical standpoint which has been preventing lower caste feminists from opening their own currents in the context of the Me too movement. Dwivedi wrote in her editorial introduction to the UNESCO journal La Revue des Femmes-Philosophes that postcolonial theory is continuous with Hindu nationalism. === Works ===  Gandhi and Philosophy: On Theological Anti-politics  In 2018, Dwivedi co-authored Gandhi and Philosophy: On Theological Anti-politics with philosopher Shaj Mohan. The book examines different aspects of Mahatma Gandhi's thought from within a unique framework and discuss his impact on 20th-century philosophy. Jean-Luc Nancy wrote the foreword. The book proposes that in addition to the metaphysical tendency in philosophy there is a 'hypophysical tendency'; hypophysics is defined as \\"a conception of nature as value\\". The distance from nature that human beings and natural objects come to have through the effects of technology lessens their value, or brings them closer to evil. Gandhi's concept of passive force or nonviolence is an implication of his hypophysical commitment to nature. Dwivedi made a separation between metaphysics and hypophysics in her Royal Institute of Philosophy lecture, \\"While both seek to diagnose the 'west', each opens on to distinct futures: metaphysics to an \\"other thinking\\" than philosophy, hypophysics to the other of thinking itself\\". Gandhi and Philosophy identifies racism with caste practices and controversially ascribes a form of racism to Gandhi. One reviewer wrote, \\"In the book, Mohan and Dwivedi argue that Gandhi not only upheld caste, but also viewed it as India's unique contribution to the world!\\". When The Indian Express reported on the developing uproar resulting from allegations of Gandhi's racism, Dwivedi said in response that Gandhi was a specific type of racist. She said that the ongoing debates on the topic of Gandhi's racism are misleading which are conducted superficially by selectively quoting Gandhi for convenience, Writing about the book in The Washington Post, Krithika Varagur charged that Gandhi's political project created the conditions for the rise of Hindu nationalism in present-day India by making religion an integral part of anti-colonialism. Dwivedi was quoted in the Post as saying, \\"Gandhi played a huge role in solidifying the Hindu majority identity in India today\\". She said that Gandhi's abuses of his power were often interpreted as truthfulness. According to Gandhi and Philosophy Gandhi's ideal state and the absolute security state are virtually indistinguishable. Since Gandhi was not committed to liberal left politics his political programs have the risk of getting appropriated by the far right . Mohan and Dwivedi wrote that M. K. Gandhi shares the responsibility for inventing Hindu religion and Hindi language. They said that Gandhi contributed to creating a political culture based on religion and for giving a Hindu character for India as a new country. Gandhi and Philosophy argues that M. K. Gandhi's insensitivity towards the suffering of the Jewish people under the Nazi state follows from his theory of truth. Gandhi suggested to the Jewish people \\"to expose oneself to annihilation in order that one is conjoined to absolute truth. In their own annihilation the Jewish people were to have the non-experience of Absolute Truth ‚Äì 'a joyful sleep'.\\"  Reception  According to Jean-Luc Nancy Gandhi and Philosophy leads to a new orientation outside of the theological, metaphysical and nihilistic tendencies in philosophy. Bernard Stiegler said that this work \\"give us to reconsider the history of nihilism in the eschatological contemporaneity and shows its ultimate limits\\" and offers a new path. Gandhi and Philosophy calls this new beginning the anastasis of philosophy. Robert Bernasconi said that the inventiveness and the constructivism behind the concept of ana-stasis, or the overcoming of stasis, has a relation to the project of re-beginning of philosophy by Heidegger. The Book Review said that the philosophical project of Gandhi and Philosophy is to create new evaluative categories, \\"the authors, in engaging with Gandhi's thought, create their categories, at once descriptive and evaluative\\" while pointing to the difficulty given by the rigour of a \\"A seminal if difficult read for those with an appetite for philosophy\\". Dwivedi's work was criticised from the point of view methodological and stylistic difficulty. Robert Bernasconi noted that Dwivedi's Gandhi and Philosophy is a difficult book and it is \\"not a book that you will understand at first reading\\". The difficulty due to the constructivist style was noted by other authors as well. Tridip Suhrud pointed to the \\"opacity\\" of style in The Hindu and explained it as the effect of \\"reflections on language\\". Gandhi and Philosophy was criticised from the point of view of the recent mounting criticisms of Gandhi in India and internationally. It was said that Gandhi and Philosophy might be exalting Gandhi while being very critical of him at the same time. The ambiguous approach to Gandhi was described in one of the commentaries in The Indian Express as \\"Mohan and Dwivedi have done a masterful job of avoiding the binary fork ‚Äî hagiography or vituperation ‚Äî as much of Gandhi and hagiography comes from a need to spiritualise Gandhi\\". Economic and Political Weekly pointed to Dwivedi's participation in the paradigm of \\"western philosophy\\", especially when Gandhi's goal was to create an alternative to Eurocentrism. EPW said that her work may be of interest only to continental philosophy as she does not participate in Indic discourses. In The Indian Express Aakash Joshi commented on the negative implications of Gandhi and Philosophy and said that through this book \\"Gandhi can be seen as a nihilist ‚Äî someone who even decries sex for reproduction and would like human society to wither away\\". Joshi stressed that this point of view is opposed to \\"secularism of a particular kind, freedom from colonial concepts, caste without violence\\".  Miscellaneous  The philosopher Barbara Cassin said that Dwivedi's theoretical stand reveals the actual political stakes in postcolonial theory. Cassin said \\"She is a philosopher\\" whose refusal to make \\"the post-colonial the first and the last word undoubtedly allows us to clarify with greater precision what is happening to women, philosophers and intellectuals in India today\\". Dwivedi has edited anthologies addressing political and philosophical issues. The volume titled The Public Sphere: From Outside the West treated the radical transformation of the public sphere and cultural landscapes through new technologies and political forms such as populism. In the field of narratology or narrative theory Dwivedi explores the questions of the ontology of literature through several directions including the functions of distinct narrative voices. The book Narratology and Ideology: Negotiating Context, Form, and Theory in Postcolonial Narratives published by Ohio State University Press, which was edited by Dwivedi, with Henrik Skov Nielsen and Richard Walsh, is an intervention in the debate on form and context. The book examines the ambition of the central concepts of both fields, namely \\"post-colonial\\" and \\"narrative\\", to serve as global categories of cultural analysis. == See also == * Women in philosophy * List of women philosophers * Jean-Luc Nancy * Nihilism * Gandhism * Hannah Arendt * Simone Weil * Narratology * Robert Bernasconi * Eschatology == References == == Further reading == *Dissent and Tolerance Essay on Fascism and Liberalism published in Outlook Magazine *Divya Dwivedi and Shaj Mohan : Essays Online at The Wire. *Divya Dwivedi Publications with Economic and Political Weekly. == External links == *Divya Dwivedi Author page at Bloomsbury Publishing Category:21st-century philosophers Category:Deconstruction Category:Narratology Category:Heidegger scholars Category:Ontologists Category:Philosophers of nihilism Category:Living people Category:Indian women philosophers Category:Lady Shri Ram College alumni Category:Indian Institute of Technology Delhi faculty Category:St. Stephen's College, Delhi alumni Category:Indian Institute of Technology Delhi alumni Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Divya Dwivedi"},{"id":"61243858","text":"Oleksandra Petrivna Skoropadska (n√©e: Durnovo; 23 May 1878 ‚Äì 29 December 1952) was a spouse of Ukrainian political leader Pavlo Skoropadskyi, a founder of a hetman dynasty and Hetman of Ukraine (1918). 11 January 1898, she married Pavlo SkoropadskyiKulyova, V.

It was described in 1907. Like all other termite species, R. virginicus is a eusocial species, characterized by individuals in a colony with overlapped generations cooperating in brood care and having reproductive division of labor. The adults that grow wings and fly from the nest to find a mate and start a new colony are called alates, or winged reproductives. In this species they are dark brown. Alates leave the nest between early February and late May. They prefer warm and sunny afternoons after rain. Like in all other termite species, all four of their wings are equal length. R. virginicus alates have wings about long with two visible, hardened and thickened veins. ==Life cycle== These termites live underground, and their presence is often undetected. Winged reproductives (alates) appear above ground in the late winter or spring. When this happens inside a house, this may alert the homeowner to the fact that the termites are present. After a short flight, the insects shed their wings, and a female will search for a crevice or other suitable underground nesting site and be joined there by a male. Having mated and excavated a chamber, the female (queen) starts laying eggs. The first batch of eggs hatch into larvae which develop into workers; these enlarge the nest, search for food and carry it back to the nest. As the number of termites in the colony increases, some workers further develop into soldiers; in well- established colonies, there may be hundreds of thousands of individual insects. Alates are not produced until the colony has been established for several years. In large colonies, it is possible for workers to develop into non-winged reproductives which lay eggs to supplement the queen's effort, or which can replace her should she die. ==Damage== The termites tunnel underground, foraging up to from the nest. If they venture above ground, they create tubes to protect their passageways. They can enter buildings through joints in the mortar or cracks in the foundations. They feed on wood, and harbour symbiotic bacteria in the gut to help them digest the cellulose. They hollow out timbers, leaving a paper-thin surface intact, which may appear blistered or peeling. In the United States, Reticulitermes flavipes, Reticulitermes virginicus and Coptotermes formosanus are responsible for 80% of the damage done by termites. ==References== Category:Termites ","title":"Reticulitermes virginicus"},{"id":"61244057","text":"Fenua Tamuera is a former I-Kiribati politician.

Robert probably was the fourth son of Robert Stewart, 1st Earl of Orkney and his wife Jean Kennedy. Although details of his origins in Scotland are unclear, he accompanied James I to England in 1603 and in 1609 was deputed to escort 800 troublesome followers of the fugitive Hugh O'Neill, 2nd Earl of Tyrone to Sweden. It is doubtful whether the task was satisfactorily executed as he was detained in Newcastle upon Tyne later that year, accompanied by three ships of Irishmen. He was nevertheless given permission to enter the service of Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden. He remained abroad until c. 1617 after which he was given a grants of land in counties Leitrim, Cavan, and Fermanagh. He again left for the continent this time to fight in the service of Sigismund III of Poland and in 1637 was given permission to recruit soldiers in Ireland to fight for the Swedish crown. In 1638 he was appointed governor of Culmore Castle on Lough Foyle, which commanded the seaward approaches to the city of Londonderry and was elected in February, 1639 to represent the city in the Irish parliament. After the outbreak of the Irish Rebellion of 1641 he was commissioned by Charles I to raise a regiment in Ireland, with which he managed to relieve Captain Audley Mervyn at Augher. They were unsuccessful in preventing Sir Phelim O'Neill from capturing Strabane but managed to secure the Barony of Raphoe which helped to guarantee the safety of Londonderry. Lack of support from England or Dublin meant that Stewart was forced to exhaust his own resources, and in the following spring his men were reduced to great extremities. Nevertheless he and Sir William Stewart defeated Sir Phelim O'Neill at Glenmaquin, near Raphoe on 16 June 1642. In 1643 Stewart was briefly made Governor of Londonderry in addition to Culmore. He continued on the offensive and in a skirmish near Clones on 13 June 1642 overpowered Owen Roe O'Neill. After the collapse of the Royalist cause in Ireland Stewart returned to Scotland but at the Restoration was given a company of foot and reappointed Governor of Londonderry as a reward for his services. He was replaced as Governor of Londonderry in 1661 by Colonel John Gorges, but allowed to retain the governorship of Culmore until his death in about 1670. ==References== * ;Attribution Category:Date of birth uncertain Category:1670s deaths Category:Scottish soldiers Category:Members of the Parliament of Ireland (pre-1801) for County Londonderry constituencies Category:Irish MPs 1639‚Äì1649 ","title":"Robert Stewart (soldier)"},{"id":"61244898","text":"Adetola Rilwan Nola (born 1990) is a Nigerian entrepreneur, and real estate investor.

He is, therefore, a precursor to the idea of Fernand Braudel and the Annales school that history needs to be studied in 'the long time' (longue dur√©e).

It housed the only orphanage in South Africa from its foundation in 1815 until 1923. It was the home of South African College from 1829 to 1841. After the Children's Home left the building, it was changed and dismantled piece by piece until the last remnants - part of a modern red brick building - were demolished in November 1981. == Background == A wealthy widow named Margaretha Anna Moller (1743-1815) petitioned the Cape Colony government early in the 19th century to build a home for old, sick, and needy women. She contributed money to establish the home. The government offered a piece of land on the end of Long Street, just west of the land that would later house St. Martin's Evangelical Lutheran Church. Moller contributed from time to time starting in 1808, and within five years, the board had accumulated ¬£3,500 for construction, mostly from her. Another factor led to the construction of the home, namely some elderly women living on the funds collected. == Orphanage founded == A few years later, Moller decided to earmark ¬£1,200 to founding an orphanage, using land intended for the Old Women's Home. Governor of the Cape of Good Hope Du Pr√© Alexander, 2nd Earl of Caledon (1807-1811) was particularly enthusiastic about the plan and contributed 5,000 Dutch rijksdaalders of his own money, while his successor, Lord Charles Somerset, issued an 8,000-riksdaalder loan for construction. The building, designed by the architect Louis Thibault, was completed in little more than a year. Shortly after Thibault's death in November 1815, Rev. Johannes Petrus Serrurier of the Groote Kerk formally opened the building and the orphanage therein. A post-ceremony collection drive netted ¬£160. The widow Moller's contribution that year was no less than ¬£6,000. From the South African College's foundation on October 1, 1829 to the dedication of the Egyptian Building next to Company's Garden on April 13, 1841 (the first building specifically erected for higher education in South Africa), the orphanage shared space with the first institution of higher education on the Cape. However, quarters were crowded and inadequate, to the point that enrollment in the school (which ranged from primary school boys to college students) declined from an original 115 to 16 within a year of the move. The orphanage, first known as the SA Weenhuis and later as the SA Kinderhuis, was run by a committee of the Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa (NGK) and the Lutheran church. The institution continues to this day, but moved in 1923 to a better site in Gardens. == Architecture  Original design === The foundation for the putative elders' house was apparently laid shortly after the grounds were secured. David van der Heever wrote in January 2005 for the Journal of the Vernacular Architecture Society of South Africa (VASSA): > The unusual plan for the orphanage probably stems from its being built > directly over the foundation originally laid for the proposed retirement > home. The latter project was itself based on the original Sailors' Hospital > on Wale Street in Cape Town. He stated that the hallmark of the blueprint is the large, cruciform central chamber (akin to a church nave) running the full length of the building, between Long and Loop Streets. 36 m long by 6 m wide by 8 m high, according to Van der Heever, the building was \\"functionally very strange\\" and may have been used for community activities such as meals and socializing, since the chamber's size left little room on the plot for any playground for the orphans or meeting hall for students of SA College. Ronald Lewcock writes in his book Early Nineteenth Century Architecture in South Africa (1963) of the similarities between the Children's Home facade and that of the Old Slave Lodge converted by Thibault and Anton Anreith into the High Court building; indeed the same hallmarks are found in most of the output of Thibault's last years before his death around this time: > There was the same horizontal grooving of the plasterwork of the wings, and, > more significant, their horizontal form was contrasted with a tendency to > vertical movement in the central bay. The latter was terminated at the top > by a semicircular pediment, a similar composition on a smaller scale to that > of the main fa√ßade of the Old Supreme Court, which was finished at about the > same time. A delightful touch was added to the fa√ßade by the coupling of the > pilasters between the windows, and a slightly more perverse one by the > addition of guttae to add a stronger modulation to the cornice over the > columns. In this, as in the whole treatment of the Classical Order, the > building was more subtly and successfully handled than the Supreme Court > fa√ßade. The design of the entrance is however, a disappointment; its > pediment was oversimplified and given inadequate visual support. Instead of > a decorative fanlight, a rather bizarre circular clerestory light with a > cartwheel pattern was inserted high in the wall above the entrance. Van der Heever views the similarities between the two buildings' design as leaving little doubt that Thibault also designed the Children's Home, since the Old Magistrate (now the site of the South African Cultural History Museum) is undoubtedly his. === Expansions from 1829 onward === South African College officially opened on October 1, 1829, with a procession of directors, Senators, professors, and members of the public at 9:00 in the morning from the old Groote Kerk, at the time the largest venue in town, to the Children's Home. A few small changes were needed, including a separation of the long nave to provide room for the new institution. Hermann Sch√ºtte, a German master mason working with Anreith and Thibault on the project, himself planned the renovation and quoted a price of 1,850 riksdaalders. === After the Children's Home departure === The building was sold for ¬£4,500 to Bechuanaland Dairies in 1923, when a better site was found for the former in Gardens. Changes followed to meet the dairy's needs. Eventually, the entire facade was unrecognizable - what was at the turn of the century an arched front entryway on Long Street had become a gold brick portico, and the Loop Street facade was changed to the point that only portions of the original wall remained. === Restoration attempts === In 1978, the architect John Rennie's survey of Cape Town downtown architecture for the Cape Provincial Institute of Architects, entitled The Buildings of Central Cape Town, found parts of the old Children's Home around what was now an auto mechanic's garage. At the time, the City of Cape Town Council wanted to expand the intersection of Loop and Buitensingel Streets. To compensate St. Martin's for the annexation of some of their property, the Council awarded that church some of the old Children's Home land, shortly after appropriating the entire parcel for the road expansion. Van der Heever, who had further researched the building's history after Rennie's 1978 discoveries, saw the expropriation of the land as an opportunity to close Orphan Street between Long and Loop Streets, thereby combining the Groote Kerk and Children's Home plots into one. This could potentially spur on integrated development of the whole area, which he suggested should consist of rebuilding the entire Children's Home, or at least the facade. In the early 1980s, \\"facadism\\" (in which facades are restored with the modern interior left intact) was more accepted than in the early 21st century. The Lutheran church showed interest at City Council meetings in building a Sunday school building on the premises, and were prepared to rebuild the orphanage, in part or in full. The Council was initially interested, but finally decided the few remnants were not worth saving. Therefore, in November 1981, all structures on the land were demolished, putting an end to Van der Heever's efforts. The Lutheran congregation bought the land, including the closed part of Orphan Street, and built the new Sunday school without a memorial to South Africa's first orphanage, which had operated for 108 years there. == Sources == * Dreyer, Rev.

Cultivation is limited to an extremely small microclimate area with conditions considered excellent for growing this type of bean, and production is low. Demand is high, and prices are six to ten times that of other cannellini-type beans. In 2002 it received Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) certification from the European Union. It is considered economically important to the survival of agriculture in the Pescia Valley and because of this is believed to have helped prevent emigration from the area. ==History== Native to the New World, beans had reportedly arrived in Rome by 1515 and Tuscany by 1528 and were widely distributed by the early 17th century. By the early 19th century the beans grown around Sorana were being recognized as high quality. Depopulation of the area caused by the world wars meant that cultivation of the Sorana bean had nearly ceased by the 1980s. By 1994 the bean was in danger of becoming extinct. Recovery is credited to the non-profit Associazione dei piccoli produttori del Fagiolo di Sorana Il Ghiareto ONLUS (Ghiareto Association), a group of small and hobbyist farmers who were the only remaining growers, which formed in 1994. During the 1990s, along with Italian journalist Indro Montanelli and led by restaurateur and photographer Valdo Verreschi, who edited a 1994 collection of works about the bean, the group promoted creation of the PGI, which encouraged more locals to start growing the beans again. In 2002 the bean was given PGI certification. A cylindrical red bean is also grown in the area and is sometimes referred to as Antico Rosso di Sorana. The white bean is sometimes referred to as \\"Bianco di Sorana\\" when the two are being discussed. Both beans are sometimes referred to as soranini. ==Description and cultivation== Dried Sorana beans Dried Sorana bean The Sorana is a climbing-type member of Phaseolus vulgaris L. species. The bean is 1.5 cm (0.6 in) long, pearly white, shiny, and slightly flattened with a skin so thin it has been called \\"imperceptible to the palate.\\" In the Sorana area they are nicknamed \\"piattellini\\" for their flat () shape. The red bean has a thicker skin and a cylindrical shape.Cultivation of Sorana beans The bean is grown in limited quantities along the east and west banks of the northwestern portion of the Pescia River near Sorana in Tuscany near the base of the Apennines about halfway between Florence and Pisa. Modern farming techniques are generally not possible in the small plots of land suitable for growing the beans. Annual production is small with no more than 660 hectares (2.5 square miles) planted each year, often by hobbyist or part-time farmers. A 2016 study found that there were approximately 40 growers, nearly half of whom did not sell commercially. Planting is during the last moon in May. The beans are grown on bamboo trellises 8 feet high, and the soil must be kept moist. Harvest is from mid-August through mid-September when the pods have nearly split. After manual harvest, the beans are dried in the sun for several days. == Microclimate == Sorana bean field on a small plot of land The Slow Food presidium in Pescia and the PGI regulations both require all beans called \\"di Sorana\\" to be grown in the Pescia Valley, Pescia Municipality, Pistoia Province. The most traditional area of cultivation is the hectares along the banks of the creek, the \\"Ghiareto\\", an area with its own microclimate. The area is 220 to 750 meters (720 to 2500 feet) above sea level with sandy soil poor in minerals, calcium, and nitrates, is humid with low levels of sun and high levels of precipitation, including heavy nightly dews, and is protected from harsh weather, all conditions considered excellent for growing this type of bean. Restaurateur Verreschi, who grew up in the town where his father grew the bean, calls it \\"an amazing microclimate\\" and says, \\"You could plant a Sorana bean anywhere‚Äîmany people have tried‚Äîand you might get a bean, but it wouldn't act like a Sorana when you cooked it.\\" Italian food writer wrote that the same beans planted elsewhere would have nothing in common with those grown in the Ghiareto. The \\"poggio\\" or highlands area within the Pescia Valley more recently started growing the beans, causing some tensions among locals as the production is higher in the poggio areas, so those farmers can ask lower prices. The quality is higher from the Ghiareto area, but Ghiareto farmers were concerned that consumers might not realize the reasons behind the higher Ghiareto prices. As part of the negotiations for product specifications for the PGI certification, producers agreed to extend protection to both areas to allow increasing the total quantity produced, which would help raise the visibility of the bean. Ghiareto producers in return are allowed to put \\"di Ghiareto\\" on their labels. The agreement also prohibited the use of herbicides, limited the maximum allowed yield per hectare, and provided an exact description of allowed harvesting methods. == Economics and impact == Even within Tuscany the bean is uncommon and outside Tuscany, even in Italy, it can be \\"impossible to find.\\" In 1994, writer Paolini, describing prices of 20,000 to 30,000 lira per kilogram, called it the \\"most expensive bean in the world.\\" 2007 Saveur magazine reported the price for Soranas was ten times that of other cannellini beans. Fraud is common. A 2016 study found that Sorana prices are typically six to seven times higher than those of standard beans. The Ghiareto Association holds annual festivals at planting and harvesting. Tourism and rural development associated with the Sorana bean is considered important, and academics William van Caenegem and Jen Cleary have speculated that the support to local farmers has helped prevent emigration to other areas and contributed to the survival of agriculture in the Pescia Valley. A 2016 study found that the PGI certification of the Sorana had \\"supported the survival of agriculture in this area and revitalized the marginalized territory of the Sorana valley by facilitating the valorization of other products, such as local extra-virgin olive oil, or by promoting rural tourism (restaurants offering special bean menus and agro-tourism).\\" == Recognition == The bean was recognized as early as the early 1800s as being of superior quality. In 1994, food writer Paolini called it \\"the undisputed king of beans.\\" In 2002 the bean was given PGI certification, one of the smallest production systems in Tuscany to be so designated. Several other Italian Phaseolus Vulgaris L. beans, including Fagioli Bianchi di Rotonda, Fagiolo Cannellino di Atina, Fagiolo Cuneo, Fagiolo di Lamon della Vallata Bellunese, and Fagiolo di Sarconi, have also been certified. Slow Food includes the Sorana in their Ark of Taste, a catalog of endangered traditional foods, one of six Tuscan beans so designated, including the Lucca red bean, the Pergentino chickpea, the Pietrasanta flat bean, the Pratomagno Zolfino bean, and the Venanzio bean. The New York Times called it \\"perhaps the most prized bean in the land of the so-called mangiafagioli (bean eaters),\\" comparing it to \\"the most sought-after grape in Burgundy.\\" Saveur magazine called the Sorana \\"legendary\\". The Food and Wine Lover's Companion to Tuscany called them the finest and most-celebrated beans of an area famous for its beans. Composer Gioachino Rossini once requested payment of \\"a few kilos of those precious beans\\" from Giovanni Pacini for correcting one of Pacini's scores. Pacini was from a Tuscan family and lived in Pescia and nearby Viareggio for much of his life. Marcella Hazan called the Sorana \\"the most precious bean grown in Italy.\\" In 2019 the Sorana bean was one of 24 PGI products selected for showcasing at the European Parliament elections. == See also == * List of Italian products with protected designation of origin ==References== ==External links== * Ghiareto Association Category:Italian products with protected designation of origin Category:Slow Food Category:Edible legumes Category:Ark of Taste foods Category:Cuisine of Tuscany ","title":"Sorana bean"},{"id":"61245136","text":"Meleri Mullan (born 14 June 2000) is an Australian professional women's footballer who plays as a forward for Adelaide University.

Blooms have an average diameter of 4 to 5 inches (10-12 cm) and can have more than 40 petals. 'Scentimental' blooms continuously from spring to fall, with small clusters of very fragrant, red and white striped petals. It has large, semi- glossy, medium green foliage. It is a repeat bloomer, and produces its best flowers and richest colors in cooler temperatures. The plant is known to be heat tolerant. ==History== Rose breeder, Tom Carruth, created more than 100 rose varieties during his career, including eleven All America Rose Selections (AARS). Carruth began his career in 1975, working with hybridizer, William Warriner at Jackson & Perkins rose nursery. He worked at the company for three years before moving to Armstrong Nursery in southern California, where he worked for seven years with hybridizer, Jack Christensen. In 1986, Carruth moved to Weeks Wholesale Rose Grower. In 1989, Carruth was promoted to rose hybridizer at the nursery. He worked at Weeks nursery for twenty years, until his retirement in 2012. Carruth had a strong interest in developing striped and unusually colored roses in his breeding program. Rose breeder, Nan Cocker, of Aberdeen, Scotland, was an influence in this area; Cocker had developed several new rose varieties with unusual colors and patterns. One of his earliest successes in striped roses was the red and white Floribunda, 'Scentimental'. He later created the striped Floribundas, 'George Burns' (1996), and 'Betty Boop' (1999). 'Scentimental' was bred by Carruth before 1996, using the stock parents, Floribunda Rosa 'Playboy' and Grandiflora Rosa 'Peppermint Twist'. The new rose variety was introduced into the United States by Weeks Wholesale Rose Grower, Inc. in 1997.

Quinary structure is thus the fifth level of protein complexity, additional to protein primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary structures. As opposed to the first four levels of protein structure, which are relevant to isolated proteins in dilute conditions, quinary structure emerges from the crowdedness of the cellular context , in which transient encounters among macromolecules are constantly occurring. In order to perform their functions, proteins often need to find a specific counterpart to which they will bind in a relatively long encounter. In a very crowded cytosol, in which proteins engage in a vast and complex network of attracting and repelling interactions, such search becomes challenging, because it involves sampling a huge space of possible partners, of which very few will be productive. A solution to this challenge requires that proteins spend as little time as possible on each encounter, so that they can explore a larger number of surfaces, while simultaneously making this interaction as intimate as possible, so if they do come across the right partner, they will not miss it . In this sense, quinary structure is the result of a series of adaptations present in protein surfaces, which allow proteins to navigate the complexity of the cellular environment. ==Early observations== With the sense with which it is used today, the term quinary structure first appeared in the work of McConkey, in 1989 . In his work, McConkey runs 2D electrophoresis gels on the total protein content of hamster (CHO) and human (HeLa) cells. In a 2D electrophoresis gel experiment, the coordinates of a protein depend on its molecular weight and its isoelectric point. Given the evolutionary distance between humans and hamsters, and considering evolutionary rates typical of mammals, one would expect a large number of substitutions to have occurred between hamsters and humans, a fraction of which would involve acidic (aspartate and glutamate) and basic (arginine and lysine) residues, resulting in changes in the isoelectric point of many proteins. Strikingly, hamster and human cells yielded almost identical fingerprints in the experiment, implying that many fewer of those substitutions actually took place. McConkey suggested in that paper that the reason why the proteins of humans and hamsters had not diverged as much he anticipated was that an additional selective pressure must have been related to the many non-specific ‚Äúinteractions that are inherently transient‚Äù experienced by proteins in the cytoplasm and which ‚Äúconstitute the fifth level of protein organization‚Äù. ==Protein interactions and quinary structure== Despite the crudeness of McConkey's experiment, his interpretation of the results were spot on. Rather than simply being hydrophilic, protein surfaces must have carefully been modulated by evolution and adapted to this network of weak interactions, often called quinary interactions. It is important to note that protein-protein interactions responsible for the emergence of quinary structure are fundamentally different from specific protein encounters. The latter are the result of relatively high-stability binding, often linked to functionally meaningful events ‚Äìmany of which have already been described ‚Äì while the former are often interpreted as some background noise of physiologically unproductive misinteractions that complicate the interpretation of protein networks and need to be avoided, so that normal cellular functions can proceed. The transient nature of these protein encounters complicates the study of quinary structure. Indeed, the interactions responsible for this upper level of protein organisation are weak and short-lived, and hence would not produce protein-protein complexes that could be isolated by conventional biochemical methods. Therefore, quinary structure can only be understood in vivo . ==In-cell NMR and quinary structure== In-cell NMR is an experimental technique prominent in the research field of protein quinary structure. The physical principle of in-cell NMR measurements is identical to that of conventional protein NMR, but the experiments rely on expressing high concentrations of the probe protein, which should remain soluble and contained in the cellular space; which introduces additional difficulties and limitations. However, these experiments provide critical insights about the cross-talk between a probe protein and the intracellular environment. Early attempts at using in-cell NMR to study protein quinary structure were hindered by a limitation caused by the very phenomenon they were trying to understand. Many probe proteins tested in these experiments turned out to produce broad signals, near the detection limit of the method, when measured inside cells of Escherichia coli. In particular, these proteins seemed to tumble as if they had molecular weights much larger than those corresponding to their size. These observations seemed to indicate that the proteins were sticking to other macromolecules, which would have led to poor relaxation properties Other in-cell NMR experiments showed that single amino acid changes of surface residues could be used to consistently modulate the tumbling of three different proteins inside bacterial cells . Charged and hydrophobic residues were shown to have the largest impact in protein intracellular mobility. In particular, more negatively charged proteins would tumble faster in comparison with near-null or positively charged proteins. In contrast, the presence of many hydrophobic residues in the protein surface would slow down protein intracellular tumbling. Protein dipole moment, a measure of charge separation across the protein, was shown to have a significant contribution to protein mobility, where high dipole moments would correlate with slower tumbling. == References == Category:Molecular biology Category:Protein structure ","title":"Protein quinary structure"},{"id":"61245316","text":"Malaysian checkers or Singaporean checkers, is a variant of the board game of draughts played primarily in Malaysia and Singapore, especially among the elder men. Similar to the Canadian checkers, it is played on a 12x12 checkered board. The game can also be played on a 8x8 board if a 12x12 board is unavailable. However, it is distinct from Checkers and Canadian Checkers in terms of its additional rules. Popular alternative names used locally for this game include Dum and Dam. == Game rules == Malaysian/Singaporean checkers follows the same rules as international draughts, with exceptions being pieces not able to move backwards (towards the player), the requirement to forfeit a capturing piece if the player fails to or wishes not to capture any enemy piece(s) with it, and a larger gameboard (12√ó12 squares instead of 10√ó10), and more checkers per player (30 instead of 20). The starting setup is shown in the diagram. === Starting position === * The game is played on a board of 12√ó12 alternating dark and light squares. The lower-leftmost square should be dark. Alternatively it may also be played on a 8x8 board with a similarly checkered pattern. * Each player has 30 pieces (12 in an 8x8 board setup). In the starting position (see illustration) the pieces are placed on the first five rows closest to the players. This leaves two central rows empty. === Moves and captures === * Each players move one piece per turn. Players choose who goes first (by tossing a coin/rocks paper scissors etc). Then turns alternate. * Ordinary pieces move one square diagonally forward to an unoccupied square. * Enemy pieces can and must be captured by jumping over the enemy piece, two squares forward to an unoccupied square immediately beyond. If a jump is possible it must be done, even if doing so incurs a disadvantage. ** Multiple successive jumps forward in a single turn can and must be made if after each jump there is an unoccupied square immediately beyond the enemy piece. It is compulsory to jump over as many pieces as possible with the capturing piece. ** A jumped piece is removed from the board at the end of the turn. (So for a multi-jump move, jumped pieces are not removed during the move, they are removed only after the entire multi-jump move is complete.) ** The same piece may not be jumped more than once. ** If a player fails to capture any possible enemy pieces or simply wishes not to and continues with a non-capturing move, then the capturing piece that was required to jump should be 'forfeited' and removed from the board. === Crowning === * A piece is crowned if it stops on the far edge of the board at the end of its turn. Another piece is placed on top of it to mark it. Crowned pieces, sometimes called kings, can move freely multiple steps in any direction diagonally and may jump over and hence capture an opponent piece some distance away and choose where to stop afterwards, but must still capture the maximum number of pieces possible. 'Forfeiting' rules apply. === Winning and draws === * A player with no valid move remaining loses. This occurs if the player has no pieces left, or if all the player's pieces are obstructed from moving by opponent pieces. * A game is a draw if neither opponent has the possibility to win the game. == See also == * Canadian checkers - similar board game with distinct rules and conventions == References == == External links == Malaysian/Singaporean Checkers at BoardGameGeek Category:Abstract strategy games Category:Draughts variants ","title":"Malaysian/Singaporean checkers"},{"id":"61245321","text":"Bernhard Steinberger (17 September 1917 - 16 December 1990) was a German engineer and economist. After 1945 he became an East German political dissident and / or victim, spending most of the period between 1949 and 1960 in prisons and labour camps. He had, by this time, already spent the war years accommodated in a succession of \\"emigrants' camps\\" in Switzerland, where he had arrived from Milan with his mother and sister in 1938 in order to escape the effects of newly introduced antisemitic legislation in Italy. (The family were Jewish.) ==BiographyProvenance and family=== Bernhard Steinberger was born in Munich where Dr. Max Steinberger, his father, worked as a prosecutor at the district courthouse. However, Bernhard's father died a couple of weeks after Bernhard was born. After the war his mother remarried which led to the birth of a sister five years younger than himself, but his mother's second marriage ended in divorce during the 1930s. After leaving school in 1934 he spent six months as a volunteer in an automobile repair shop before embarking on an engineering apprenticeship with Ertelwerk, a manufacturer of Precision mechanical products, in their factory in the western part of central Munich. He demonstrated a rare enthusiasm and talent for constructing model airplanes and dreamt of becoming an aviation technician or an aircraft designer. However, the National Socialist government which had taken power in 1933 were now enshrining in legislation the shrill racist rhetoric for which they had become noteworthy in opposition. The Steinbergers are described in sources as a family of secular or assimilated Jews: Bernhard's Jewish provenance made it unlikely that he would be offered a fulfilling job in the aviation industry, especially given the sector's important role in the government's re-armament plans. In July 1936, still aged only 18, Bernhard Steinberger emigrated to Milan, to be followed soon afterwards by his mother and sister. ===Italy and exile=== In November he found an illegal badly paid job as a draftsman. Next came a design job with a firm making house building machinery. In October 1937 he finally obtained a design job with a manufacturer of road-construction machinery and tractors: the work was sufficiently well paid to enable him to support his mother and sister. However, antisemitic legislation to be set in place towards the end of 1938 put an end to hopes of a secure future in Italy, and Berhard Steinberger emigrated to Switzerland where visa requirements had not yet been introduced. He arrived in Z√ºrich on 2 September 1938, followed a couple of weeks later by his mother and sister. They received financial support from Jewish refugee support charities (\\"J√ºdische Fl√ºchtlingshilfe\\"). There was no question of embarking on a normal life in Switzerland, however. They were classified as \\"tolerated migrants\\" (\\"tolerierten Emigranten\\") which meant that they were not permitted to look for nor to take paid work. ===Switzerland=== Steinberger made good use of his enforced unemployment. During 1938/39 he attended lectures and took part in experiments for two terms at the Photographic Institute at the ETH (Federal Institute of Technology) in central Z√ºrich. During 1939/40 he participated in a Metal Work course. He became a frequent visitor to the library at the Swiss Social Archives, also in the city centre. It was here that he met his first wife, a librarian. She was a member of the (recently banned) Communist Party of Switzerland. The marriage broke apart after a year and a half, but Steinberger's interest in politics continued to deepen. At the library he also became a committed reader of the weekly journal \\"Aufbau der schweizerischen Religi√∂sen Sozialisten\\". Leonhard Ragaz, a leading theologian who headed up the organisation producing the journal, was an energetic man and a committed pacifist who also campaigned very publicly in support of the interests of recently arrived migrants. War broke out in September 1939. All the countries surrounding Switzerland participated directly in it apart from Liechtenstein. Switzerland was powerfully impacted. In March 1940 the Swiss parliament decided to revoke the blanket ban on paid employment being undertaken by \\"tolerated migrants\\" (refugees), but at the same time plans were set in train for the construction of labour camps to be administered by the police. In July 1940 Bernhard Steinberger was sent to the labour camp at Tamins, just outside Chur in Graub√ºnden/Grisons. This turned out to be the first of six different labour camps in which he would successively be accommodated during the war. During that period he was able to obtain a work permit for work which he undertook as a designer for a total of twenty months. In the camps he came into close contact with German communists, and involved himself in some of their activities. That included trying to find ways to improve conditions in the camps and the establishment of the (very successful) \\"Emigrants' Cultural Community\\" (\\"Kulturgemeinschaft der Emigranten in Z√ºrich e.V.\\"). It also involved setting up (secretive) party cells and, as the war progressed, Free Germany groups in the camps. As the war approached its end Bernhard Steinberger was accepted into the German Communist Party at a conference held at Z√ºrich in February 1945. In recognition of his participation in party work his membership was backdated to 1940. ===Postwar Germany=== In September 1945 Steinberger was repatriated to Munich, which by this time was part of the US occupation zone. The Bavaria Communist Party (\\"KP Bayern\\") very soon sent him to take charge of \\"Economic Office B\\" (\\"Wirtschaftsamt B\\") in the Wasserburg district, in the countryside between Munich and Salzburg. Later, in May 1946, he was appointed Bavaria Communist Party district secretary for Wasserburg. He also took charge of the \\"Economy and Communities\\" department in the regional leadership of the Bavaria Communist Party. The next year the regional leadership sent him across to the Social Sciences faculty (\\"Gesellschaftswissenschaftliche Fakult√§t\\" / \\"GwewiFak\\") at the University of Leipzig in order to undertake a Study course in Economics. The intention was that on completion of his studies he should become the Economics expert on the national executive of the national Communist Party. It was, even at the time, a little unusual for a leading party officer in the US occupation zone to cross the frontier into the Soviet occupation zone in order to study Economics, but for the Communist Party leadership the political context at Leipzig was presumably an attraction. (It would take several more years before the frontier on the ground dividing East Germany from West Germany would become impermeable.) In 1946 Berhard Steinberger married his second wife, Ibolya. The two of them had met in Switzerland, where Ibolya, secretly a Communist Party member, had found work as a house-maid/nanny. When the war had ended Ibolya's mother was still living in Fels≈ën√°na, in the countryside to the south of Budapest. In May 1947 Bernhard and Ibolya relocated from Munich to Leipzig with their infant son. At Leipzig Steinberger studied with Prof. Fritz Behrens, later remembered as one of the principal architects of East Germany's \\"New Economic System\\". Behrens rated Steinberger's abilities highly and was strongly supportive. It was probably during 1947 that Berhard Steinberger joined the recently constructed Socialist Unity Party (\\"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands\\" / SED). Steinberger would later look back on his time at Leipzig as the best time in his life, despite the food shortages and lack of heating. He prepared quickly for the appropriate state exams and made progress on a dissertation. ===Arrest and detention of Iboyla Steinberger=== In October 1949 the region administered as the Soviet occupation zone was relaunched as the Soviet sponsored German Democratic Republic (East Germany). By that time things had gone terribly wrong for the Steinbergers. Ibolya Steinberger was arrested first. She was detained in Budapest on 28 May 1949 as a suspected spy. She was making her way home from a three-month stay with her mother in Fels≈ën√°na, which she had undertaken so that her infant son might meet his grandmother (and vice versa). In her passport she had carelessly placed a folded up copy of an article by Georg Markos which her husband had sent her to look after for the institute where he worked. It concerned \\"The Impact on state-owned industries of the Hungarian three-year plan\\". It later became clear that the article had already been published and widely distributed in academic circles: it contained no secrets. The men who arrested her at Budapest had nevertheless decided that she was working as a courier on behalf of her husband, who in his turn was working for \\"the Americans\\". A link was made to the activities of the American spy Noel Field who had been arrested in Czechoslovakia, amid much state mandated publicity, two weeks earlier. Ibolya Steinberger's travel patterns, taking in Hungary, Germany's Soviet occupation zone and Switzerland, fitted with the espionage hypothesis. In what she later described as \\"a state of diminished accountability\\" Iboyla Steinberger was persuaded to sign a false confession.Ibolya Steinberger, Schreiben an die Zentrale Parteikontrollkommissionder SED, 27. 6. 1956, p. 3 Two weeks later she retracted that confession to an officer of the Soviet security services, but the retraction had no obvious effect. By the end of October 1949 the Hungarian authorities had found three false witnesses to testify against her. (One of these, Istv√°n Stolte, would retract his evidence in 1954.) Ibolya Steinberger was placed under enormous pressure, and after being asked in a threatening manner whether she actually wanted ever to see her husband and child again, she was persuaded to sign another false confession, this time fully conscious of the importance of ensuring that she was incriminating no one except herself. In April 1950 she was interned, it was explained, \\"for a short time\\". In fact she was held at Kistarcsa for a little under four years, including one year during which she was held in solitary confinement. It was only on 21 August 1953 that she had the chance to read the three or four line indictment which had led to her detention. The charge was one of espionage on behalf of the Americans. About a week later she was given an eight-year sentence, against which four and a half years already spent in investigatory custody and internment would be off-set. Ibolya Steinberger spent another year in the women's prison at Kistarcsa. At a secret hearing in July/August 1954 she was informed that she was not guilty and would soon be released. In preparation for that, she would be transferred to Budapest by the end of August. Actually it was only at the end of October 1954 that she was sent to the \\"transfer prison\\" in Budapest. She was held for a further six months without any sort of court hearing. Conditions were markedly worse than before. She was not permitted to write anything and her cell was unheated. While her hands and feet were frozen, she had open skin sores that went untreated, as did the stomach complaint that she had picked up. Then, on 4 May 1955, \\"because of an amnesty\\", she was returned to her mother and her (now eight and a half year old) son in Fels√∂n√°na. By this time Ibolya Steinberger weighed just 35 kg (roughly 78 pounds). During the rest of 1955 she received a succession of official assurances that work was underway on a change to her conviction. But when she was finally able to depart for Berlin on 2/3 March 1956, there was still no sign of that. Only on 4 October 1956 did the Hungarian High Court issue decision \\"B.Eln. Tan. 001353/1956/2\\", declaring the defendant \\"free and rehabilitated\\" from the charges against her \\"due to the absence of any criminal offence\\" (\\"wegen Fehlens eines Straftatbestandes\\"). A written copy of that decision was handed over by the Hungarian embassy in East Berlin, but only in 1960. ===Arrest and detention of Berhard Steinberger=== Bernhard Steinberger was detained a couple of weeks after his wife. On 9 June 1949 he was arrested in Leipzig by members of the Soviet security services, and that same night taken by train to Berlin and the large Hohensch√∂nhausen detention centre in Berlin. Hohensch√∂nhausen later became infamous as a Stasi facility, but in 1949 it was still under the control of the Soviet authorities. Forty years later, in 1989, Bernhard Steinberger recalled his experiences at Hohensch√∂nhausen: \\"After I was admitted ... I was interrogated without a break. I should confess my crimes: my wife had already confessed. I was physically mistreated, sometimes with beatings and kickings, but only rarely, and always within the breaking-point threshold. Much more serious was the sleep deprivation and being forced to listen to the cries of people being beaten in the nearby cells\\". Slowly Steinberger came to understand that his arrest had not been a mistake by junior officials, but the result of a series of cold political calculations that would cost dozens of people their lives in the People's democracies of central Europe. His indictment ran to almost half a page, supporting the core accusation of \\"espionage and sabotage performed on behalf of an imperialist power, directed against the Soviet Union, the People's democracies and the Soviet occupation zone [of Germany]\\". The bizarre charges were constructed around Steinberger's interactions with the Hungarian Communist Party group during his and their time in Z√ºrich. The other pillar on which the accusations rested also came from his time in Z√ºrich and concerned his contacts with the Unitarian Service Committee (USC) headed up by Noel Field. It was true that the USC had agreed to fund Steinberger's engineering studies when he was in Switzerland, but the offer had subsequently been withdrawn after the Swiss authorities objected to it. The USC in Switzerland had provided three more modest cash grants to Steinberger in order to finance (1) a trip to Bern in 1943, (2) attendance on a postwar course for academics and (3) to fund his return to Germany in 1945. Whatever the USC's true status, the Soviet authorities had become convinced that it was an American front organisation for unwelcome espionage activities. Steinberger did what he could to prove his innocence, working through his curriculum viate with his accusers and giving details of all the contacts he had had in Switzerland. He took great care to avoid coming up with anything that could be construed as a confession. But events unfolded according to their own momentum, regardless of anything he could do or say. In November 1950, after not quite eighteen months in detention, he was informed that the \\"distance tribunal\\" (\\"Ferntribunal\\") in Moscow had decided on a fifteen-year sentence. It was, like many such decisions at the time, the result of a administrative process. No trial had taken place. No witnesses or proof had been presented for examination. There had been no defense counsel involvement. While Ibolya Steinberger waited to learn her fate in a reassigned wartime detention camp at Kistarcsa, on 25 December 1950 Berhard Steinberger began the long rail journey from Berlin across the Soviet Union. His transport reached the Vorkuta labour camp complex on 1 February 1951. He was allocated to Camp 9 and, for daytime work, Shaft No. 8. Initially his difficulties were exacerbated by his inability to speak or understand Russian. Physical conditions in the camp were particularly harsh: over time they appear to have improved later. For Steinberger there was a constant current of anti-semitism which he learned to ignore, but it never completely went away. He was fit, and as he began to master the language and become acclimatized to the conditions, he began to find the hard physical work manageable, except during the final six months of his time in the camp when his customary fitness became compromised following of an accident. Mentally and physically, he remained in one piece. Steinberger later said that life in the labour camp gave him a realistic picture of the inner condition of Soviet society under Stalin. Stalin's death in March 1953 was followed by what some sources call the Khrushchev Thaw and, among camp inmates, a cautious revival of hope. On 1 April 1954 Steinberger submitted to the Soviet Party Central Committee an application for a review of his trial. Later he learned that his application had been suppressed by labour camp administrators, however. In May 1955 he addressed a personal letter of compalint to First Secretary Khrushchev, and another to the Party Central Control Commission. An officer from the military prosecutors' office was mandated to look at the case, but at the end of September 1955, before he could do so the officer's assignment was cancelled as an indirect consequence of the so-called \\"Adenauer-Initiative\\". Identified as an \\"amnestied war criminal\\", Bernhard Steinberger was released and arrived back in Berlin on 10 October 1955. ===Home to the German Democratic Republic=== Steinberger lost little time in applying to the party central committee for rehabilitation, which he did on 31 October 1955. At this stage he received only a qualified endorsement, however, in the form of a so- called \\"professional cover\\" (\\"berufliche Absicherung\\"). However, he did received backing from Gerhard Harig, the relevant secretary of state, for his plan to work for an \\"Aspirantur\\" academic qualification. With effect from 1 April 1956 he was enrolled as an Aspirant at the Institute for Economic Sciences at the German Academy of Sciences in (East) Berlin. His supervisor was the same Prof. Fritz Behrens who had taught him back in 1947 when he had first crossed over from the west, and who was now deputy director of the institute. Steinberger's work focused on the theme of \\"Planning and Labour productivity\\", which covered a politically explosive and economically crucial set of challenges with which, some felt, the German Democratic Republic never entirely came to terms. Steinberger plunged into his research work with relish, investigating a succession of case studies at state-owned enterprises, and discovering a succession of abuses in the process, both in respect of the manufacturing production cycles and involving export agreements. The Steinbergers continued to come up against ominous official reluctance as they pursued their claim for full and unqualified political rehabilitation. It was only on 14 July 1956 that a resolution of the National Party Control Commission confirmed their party membership since 1945. By now feeling thoroughly insulted, on 7 October 1956 they lodged a protest with the Control Commission. A few months later Benhard and Iboyla Steinberger would both find themselves excluded from the party. ===Re-arrest=== On 29 November 1956, slightly more than a year after he got back from the Soviet labour camps, Bernhard Steinberger was identified by the security services as a member of what the East German media later took to demonizing as the Harich Group, and arrested. He was taken back to the Hohensch√∂nhausen detention centre in Berlin, which since his previous experiences of the place had become a Stasi facility. It later turned out that the party politburo had approved his arrest on 27 November. The Stasi had by this time been monitoring Wolfgang Harich's dangerous dilettante activism for some time, and certainly since he had presented his ideas to the Soviet ambassador Georgy Pushkin in October 1956. Steinberger was caught up in the same surveillance programme. Surviving Stasi records include two reports on Steinberger submitted to the department's West Germany intelligence directorate (HVA) on 28 November by an informant identified as \\"GI Walter\\". \\"GI Walter\\" may have been one of Steinberger's fellow \\"aspirants\\" at the Academy of Sciences. The reports are dated 31 October and 16 November, and they indicate that the \\"Harich Group\\" (which in this context effectively meant Wolfgang Harich and his friend Manfred Hertwig) had picked out Steinberger as the man to elaborate a new economic programme in a post-Ulbricht East German government. Evidence held by the authorities also included a telephone intercept of a call that Steinberger had made to his wife from Harich's apartment on 22 November 1956, asking her to take part in a meeting. In fact Steinberger had met Wolfgang Harich only twice before his arrest. It was Manfred Hertwig, as editor of the \\"Deutsche Zeitschrift f√ºr Philosophie\\", who had mentioned Bernhard Steinberger to Harich and then invited Steinberger to that meeting in Harich's apartment on 22 November. As the afternoon and evening wore on Harich had expounded to the two of them his ideas for a programme of political reform, also speaking of ways in which such a programme might be made available to the public in the event that his preferred approach, which involved presenting his programme to the party central committee, was followed by rejection. In reply to Harich's request, Steinberger said that he was ready to work through the draft of the policy programme which Harich wanted to complete over the next few days, \\"casting a critical eye over it and, especially, so far as might be necessary, to rework the economics part\\". Harich and Steinberger agreed on the need for absolute secrecy in relation to third parties, especially since Harich suspected (correctly) that his telephone was being tapped. This conspiratorial aspect of their relationship would weigh strongly against Steinberger at his subsequent trial. ===Interrogation and trial=== On 25 November Harich visited Steinberger at the latter's apartment and handed over the draft of his Reform Programme for critical review. At the time of his arrest four days later Steinberger had still not made a start on reviewing the programme and it is far from clear that he had even read it, since his time had been taken up with a work-related trip to Leipzig. Influenced by his friend Richard Wolf he had become increasingly uncertain over whether he should be having anything at all to do with Wolfgang Harich's \\"adventurism\\" (as Wolf termed it). None of this was taken into consideration at Steinberger's trial, however. On 9 March 1957 he was sentenced at the East German High Court under Article 6 of the Constitution to a four-year prison term, having been found guilty of \\"Boykotthetze\\" (loosely, \\"calling for a boycott\\"), a charge frequently used by the East German courts against dissidents during this period. The pre-trial investigations and hearings ran from 29 November 1956 till 14 February 1957. That included forty-one minuted interrogation sessions, starting on the night of his arrest with an interrogation that ran from 20.30 in the evening to 4.00 the following morning. As part of the process Steinberger (like Hertwig) was required to provide a detailed r√©sum√© of his life to that point (dated 1 January 1957). He was also required to provide separately a \\"Rechenschaftslegung √ºber meine geistige Entwicklung bis heute\\", giving details of his spiritual and religious development (dated 9 January 1957). This document covers 43 pages of typescript. The psychological pressure under which he was kept throughout this experience led him to provide the required statement of \\"repentance\\" - by this time an integral part of the Stalinist \\"show terror trial\\" ritual since the time of Bukharin. But the statement of \\"repentance\\" that emerged in the case of Bernhard Steinberger was neither effusive nor unqualified: * \\"I am clear that arrest has prevented me undertaking political actions against the German Democratic Republic. It has been established - even if I had broken from Harich, and it is not certain that I had - I would not have abandoned my oppositional attitude\\". It will be observed that the simple removal of the word \\"not\\" in two places would completely reverse the meaning of the second of the two sentences included here. And a nuanced political ambivalence remained apparent in Steinberger's later life. His commitment to socialism never wavered, but his critical attitude towards what the relevant governments termed \\"Real socialism\\" (which critical comrades came to view as increasingly indistinguishable from \\"Soviet- style socialism\\") became increasingly pronounced, at least until he came to appreciate that a ruling party unable or unwilling to differentiate between a reformer and a revisionist was unlikely to be interested in the ideas put forward by either. ===Against the preferred intellectual currents=== In the course of his (carefully minuted) interrogation dated 8 December 1956, and again in the document he compiled for his interrogators a month later detailing his \\"spiritual and religious development\\", Steinberger sets out his underlying ideas for the reform of the planned economy. His criticism of the bureaucratic and administrative focus of the East German planning system, as well as his advocacy for the concept of self-administering businesses, together with the central position in his thinking of the Law of value, reflect a set of economic guidelines and priorities that in most respects follow ideas of his old mentor and tutor Prof. Fritz Behrens. It was probably not a total coincidence that during 1957 Fritz Behrens found himself accused by the authorities of \\"economic theoretical revisionism\\" and stripped of all his academic posts. Steinberger was attacked in the mainstream East German press. An article appearing in Neues Deutschland on 1 December 1957 later formed a basis for a legally framed defamation accusation which he addressed to the prosecutor's office in 1963. === Productive detention at a price=== He was sentenced to a four-year term of imprisonment on 4 March 1957. On the same occasion precisely the same sentence was given to Wolfgang Harich and Manfred Hertwig. On 4 April 1957 Steinberger was transferred to the penal labour camp at the Stasi Hohensch√∂nhausen detention complex. His surveillance order contained the chilling form of words entered by the prosecutor: \\"Strafe mu√ü verb√º√üt werden\\" (\\"Sentence must be served\\"). That had the effect of ruling out, from the start, the granting of parole after two years which in \\"non- political\\" cases would normally have been applied. Ibolya Steinberger was left to bring up their son as a single parent. While working at the Elektro- Apparate-Werke (\\"Electrical Appliances Plant\\") in Berlin-Treptow she suffered a physical collapsed. Later, despite opposition from the party's National Control Commission, she was able to find work that was less physically demanding in the medical support sector. Steinberger fared better than his experiences in the Soviet labour camp earlier n the decade might have led him to anticipate. He was still in Berlin. Fairly soon he received agreement that he could undertake academic work. He worked on lecture notes and studied more generally on political economics for the Institute for Economic Sciences at the German Academy of Sciences where he had been working at the time of his arrest. He was also producing work for the \\"Sciences department\\" of the party central committee. It was presumably at least in part because of the extent to which his academic career had been interrupted by \\"events\\" that Bernhard Steinberger had never completed a doctoral thesis. Now, while still in prison, he was able to take up research work in preparation for a doctoral dissertation. His written permission came in a hand-written one-word comment, \\"Einverstanden\\" (\\"Agreed\\") dated 4 July 1957, from the man in charge at the Ministry of State Security (Stasi), Erich Mielke, himself. His allocated supervisor, Dr. Herbert Neumann from the Economics Department carefully guided him towards a firmly theoretcal topic that would require no contact with real- world East German state enterprises. He pursued his studies on the presumably innocuous topic of \\"Wachstumsgesetze der sozialistischen erweiterten Reproduktion\\". (The work appears to have remained unpublished and the doctorate, at this point, not completed, though presumably elements of it found their way into Steinberger's academic work during the 1960s and 70s.) Of course privileges signed off by the head of the Stasi came with a price tag. Between December 1957 and October 1960 Bernhard Steinberger was a \\"Kammeragent\\". That means he acted as a covert \\"contact person\\" on behalf of the authorities. He compiled 24 reports for \\"management\\" in which he recorded details of discussions, disagreements and sources of discontent among the detainees. In this way he was able to contribute to the development of \\"fairer working conditions\\" for inmates. But the Stasi (who were still in charge of his detention at Hohensch√∂nhausen) wanted more. Division HA I/7/II (a section of the National People's Army involved in Counterintelligence) recruited Steinberger for a piece of special work: he was invited to help \\"enlighten\\" and \\"expose\\" a People's Army officer who had already been convicted as a spy. On 3 January 1958 Steinberger signed up for the assignment, choosing the code name \\"Fritz Schwarz\\". However, a few days later, on 14 January, he informed the relevant commanding officer that he was not prepared to betray his socialist convictions and play the role of a \\"tuppenny-ha'penny youth\\" (eines \\"Achtgroschenjungen\\"). Despite this, he was still re-registered as a \\"Geheim Informator\\" (GI / \\"Secret Informant\\") on 1 April 1958. However, records show that the counterintelligence division decided to \\"break off the connection\\" on 23 July 1958, since \\"GI Fritz Schwarz\\" had not fulfilled the demands made of him. ===Release: with strings attached=== Bernhard Steinberger was released on 26 November 1960, two days ahead of the scheduled end of his sentence thanks to a \\"Gnadenerweis\\" (loosely, \\"mercy certificate\\") issued by the State Council (Staatsrat). For this particular \\"pardon\\" he was required to sign the usual pre-printed \\"Statement of obligation\\" (\\"Verpflichtung\\"): \\"I will show myself worthy of the 'Gnadenerweis' from the State Council of the German Democratic Republic through honest work, and I commit myself to comply with the laws of the German Democratic Republic\\". More eye-catching for some commentators was another \\"Statement of obligation\\" which he had signed a month earlier, on 24 October 1960: \\"To me it is no more than a self-evident part of my East German citizenship that I should work with the Ministry for State Security (Stasi), and this obligation is only increased because I have acted against the state, which as long as I live I will regret. I will steadfastly act in accordance with this obligation everywhere and ignoring anyone [attempting to block my determination to do this], and this I irrevocably swear. I choose the cover name \\"Fritz\\". In terms of the principal undertaking provided this statement differs little from the stanadard declaration of obligation signed by hundreds of thousands of Stasi informants over the years, though readers who detect a hint of irony (which presumably his interlocutors at the time failed to spot) may find themselves tempted to the suspicion that on this occasion the informant involved helped with the drafting of the text for his own declaration. === An unsatisfactory informant === Steinberger's signed commitments came after four lengthy conversation in which Lieutenant Enderlein of HA V/2/II (military counterintelligence) informed the newly re-recruited \\"GI\\" (secret informant) of a concern on the part of the authorities that, following Steinberger's release, he was more than likely to be contacted by representatives of the Hamburg-based opposition group \\"Der dritte Weg\\" (\\"The Third Way\\"), who would want to recruit him or persuade him to emigrate to the west without permission (which would be illegal). When he was contacted he was to report details to his handlers. (To be quite sure, arrangements were made through the Stasi for Steinberger's telephone to be tapped during January and February 1961.) One individual whom Enderlein said was likely to contact him was his former \\"Harich Group\\" contact, Manfred Hertwig. In fact, the anticipated approaches never materialised. He received a postcard from Hertwig on which he was able to report, but it amounted to no more than an innocuous greeting, without any reported follow-up. In 1965 Steinberger was able to report a couple of political conversations he had conducted with a Hamburg journalist, which involved further greetings from Hertwig. For the rest, in terms of the kind of detail likely to interest his Stasi handlers, the records indicate that DSteinberger's reports were disappointingly bland. In meetings with handlers he repeated his insistence that he would never betray his personal or political convictions and there was no question of attempting to sum up the characters of people he had known over time. He explained that for him to attempt to do that would risk misrepresenting their current [political] opinions, because people can change their minds. He pointed out that he himself was driven by far too many ideological ambiguities to be able to report with clarity on the opinions of other people. Where - in exceptional cases - Steinberger can bring himself to mention in his reports people whom he comes across at work (or elsewhere) then he never writes anything negative. There is no ammunition for any denunciation or systemartic \\"Zersetzungs programme\\". In 1960 he provided a glowing report on the works director at VEB Motorenwerk Zschopau, a major motor-cycle producer. Steinberger knew the man well. The party already received plenty of reports on him because of his senior position at the factory. Steinberger's report testifies to his outstanding character, his professional accomplishment and his political soundness. In 1961 his report to his handler consisted of a robust defense of a leading official at the Economics College in Berlin-Karlshorst who had suffered unjustified attacks from colleagues with influence in the party hierarchy. Otherwise, records indicate that Steinberger increasingly used his meetings with his handler to discuss his personal problems, and would then move on to discuss with outrageous candour the political and ideological questions which were bothering him. Naturally deep political-philosophical discussions were not included on the script of his Stasi handler who was unable to provide any very convincing answers. Because of all this, Steinberger's consciencously provided routine reports and assessments, along with the reports on him provided by other informants, led handlers to conclude that he was an irrascible and incurable \\"revisionist\\" and deviant who, because of his own experiences of harsh treatment by state agencies, could probably be expected to avoid going too far with his oppositional attitude. In the absence of satisfactory results, it seems likey that it was in 1963 that HA V/2/II (military counterintelligence) reassigned \\"GI-Fritz\\" to \\"Abteilung (section) XX/6\\" of \\"City Administration Greater Berlin\\" (at that ime still within the ambit of the Stasi), as a \\"Sicherungs GI\\" (Security Secret Informant) at the Berlin Economics College (\\"Hochschule f√ºr √ñkonomie ...\\"). From the point of view pof the authorities this was not a satisfactory solution, since Steinberger refused to follow instructions in terms of reporting on the behaviours of individuals. On 3 April 1964 his hader reported that \\"In respect of many issues the GI shares the opinion of Havemann [a prominent government critic]. His ideologies gets closer and closer to those of class enemy. There are a lot of things he does not acknowledge ... With this GI you have to conduct constant ideological disputes\\". After 1967 his handlers reported that they kept only in \\"loose contact\\" with this informant, sufficient only to ascertain Steinbergrer's own opinions about political developments. So the files show the Stasi in 1968 recording Steinberger's \\"negative attitude\\" over the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia. On 17 February 1969 \\"Abteilung (section) XX/6\\" gave up on their troublesome GI and their files on and from \\"GI Fritz\\" were archived. === Struggling for a return to \\"normality\\" === After his release from detention at the end of 1960 Steinberger worked, for approximately six months, at VEB Elektro-Mechanik in Berlin as a \\"Technisch begr√ºndete Arbeitsnorm (TAN) Berarbeiter\\", responsible for ensuring product conformity to prescribed standards. He quickly became a TAN group leader, remaining in post till agreement had been reached over his longer term professional future. Following consultation with the Secretary of State at the Ministry for Higher Education it was agreed that the pre-doctoral work that Steinberger had undertaken while in detenention on the \\"Wachstumsgesetze der sozialistischen erweiterten Reproduktion\\" provided sufficient evidence of Steinberger's suitability for an academic post. He was advised to apply to the Economics College (\\"Hochschule f√ºr √ñkonomie \\") in Berlin-Karlshorst. With the agreement of both the Secretary of State and of the party central committee, on 16 June 1961 he accepted an appointment as a research assistant at the college's Institute for Popular Economic Planning (\\"Institut f√ºr Volkswirtschaftsplanung\\"). However, the path to a conventional academic career remained blocked by a clause in the court judgment he had received on 9 March 1957, which had stipulated that Steinberger \\"should not be active in the public service nor in any leading function in economics or the arts\\". Accordingly, on 2 September 1961 Steinberger applied to the East German Prosecutors' office for \\"remission of the punitive measures\\". based on undertakings he had received in connection with the \\"Gnadenerweis\\" (loosely, \\"mercy certificate\\") on which his release from custody at the end of 1960 had been based. In addition to the lifting of the restrictions on his right to progress his academic career, he also sought restoration of his right to vote and stand for election. ===In pursuit of restorative justice=== Two years later, on 20 January 1963, Steinberger turned to the Prodecutor's Office with an application for the punishment to be struck out. In a detailed submission in support he starts with the way on which he was already defamed in the party mass-circulation newspaper, Neues Deutschland, on 1 December 1957. He had already been punished for actions against peace, which was clearly unjustified. Only on 16 May 1963 did he receive a confirmation from the chief prosecutor that the conviction had indeed been struck out from the Punishments Register on 9 May 1963, subject to the consent of Central Department IX of the Ministry for State Security (Stasi), which was inferred from a characteristic one word note (\\"Einverstanden\\" (\\"Agreed\\")) added personally by the Stasi boss, Erich Mielke. On the day he applied to the Prosecutor's Office to have his punishment struck out Steinberger also lodged a claim for restitution with the State Council (Staatsrat). The claim concerned six and a third years of detention while not guilty, and the loss of property in connection with the Rajk affair which had erupted in 1949 in the People's Republic of Hungary. Back in March 1958 his wife had already, through her lawyer, received notification from the Leipzig city authorities that furniture which the family had acquired by means of a loan agreement had been withdrawn at some point following the couple's arrest in 1949. She had been informed through the same intermediary that there existed \\"no record\\" concerning the whereabouts of their other assets, such as household goods, books, clothes and personal papers. Everything they had possessed at the time of their arrest was \\"unfindable\\", as though there never had been a Steinberger family living in Leipzig. Steinberger pursued the matter with the authorities again in 1963 despite being advised by his Stasi handler, with whom at this point he was still in regular contact as an informant (\\"Geheim Informant\\"), that he had forfeited any claim he might have had for compensation over his detention as an innocent man through his \\"hostile actions against the German Democratic Republic\\" (wegen seine \\"feindlichen Handlungen gegen die DDR\\"). ===Return to teaching=== On 18 April 1963 Bernhard Steinberger finally received a communication from the secretary of state that the authorities were \\"in agreement with his commitement to teaching\\" (\\"Einsatz in der Lehrt√§tigkeit einverstanden\\"). The threat to his future academic career from the stipulation in his sentence back on 9 March 1957 that he \\"should not be active in the public service nor in any leading function in economics or the arts\\" appeared to have been lifted. On 24 April 1963, after discussions with future colleagues at the college Steinberger reluctantly but definitively withdrew his claims for restitution: \\"I will not disguise the fact that my decision to draw a line under the events of 1949-1955 is a difficult one. But my desire to live in harmony with the party to which I feel I belong was decisive. Future developments would make a mockery of his reasoning here. Steinberger's strong reservations about the party leadership of Comrades Ulbricht and Honecker continued to underpin his political attitudes. The party advised him later during the 1960s that his expulsion from it had become irrevocable. There were more disappointments and indignities, but during the later 1960s he was nevertheless able to make progress with his academic career. In 1963 Steinberger lodged his (first) application for restoration of his recognition as a victim of National Socialist persecution. He had to wait till December 1967 before that status was re-conferred. In February 1964 he was required to break off work on a research project he was undertaking for the National Planning Commission. Then, after lodging a complaint with the State Council (Staatsrat), he was permitted a two year research contract with the Economics Research Institute of the National Planning Commission. The subject of his researches was work-force planning in the context of overall long-term economic planning (\\"Volkswirtschaftliche Bilanzierung und langfristige Planung der Arbeitskr√§fte\\"). He was able to incorporate this work into a dissertation entitled \\"Grundlagen der prognostischen und perspektivischen zentralen Arbeitskr√§fte- und Bildungsplanung\\" in return for which he finally received a doctorate, two days after his fiftieth birthday, on 19 September 1967. The assessors awarded his work a \\"summa cum laude\\" commendation. On 1 June 1970 Steinberger accepted a professorship in Socialist Economics, over the next seven years, till his retirement in 1977, his focus was entirely on teaching. He planned to research and obtain his habilitation, a higher academic qualification generally seen as a way to reinforce a professional career in the universities sector. However, his plans for a suitable dissertation, submitted in 1974, were not accepted. During the surging wave of social and political changes that were a feature of 1989/90 Bernhard Steinberger became a Berlin-based advisor to New Forum. ===A final appeal for justice=== Developments during the 1980s did much to vindicate Bernhard Steinberger's long-standing diagnoses of the East German economic model. In those countries were the Soviet sponsored states of Eastern Europe had traditionally been able to trade East Germany had during the 1960s and 1970s enjoyed a near monopoly in heavy engineering and other \\"technical\\" manufacturing sectors, but during the 1980s, as heavy industry in the Soviet Union began to modernise, East German salesmen in shared export markets began to encounter Soviet comrades not as partners but as commercial rivals. Increasingly dependent on variously disguised West German subsidies, the country was running out of cash and credit. After 1985 Winds of change blowing across from, of all places, the Moscow Kremlin left East Germany's increasingly geriatric political leaders feeling isolated and uncertain about the future (although their commitement to \\"traditional\\" socialism appeared solid). When street protesters breached the Berlin Wall in November 1989 it quickly became clear that Soviet troops standing by had received no orders to intervene on behalf of the status quo. There would be no repeat of 1953. Events assumed their own momentum. That was the context in which, on 15 January 1990, Bernhard Steinberger saw an opportunity to renew his campaign for justice with an application to the High Court in East Berlin for the \\"revision of the judgments against Harich, Steinberger and Hertwig\\". He summarized again his reform ideas from 1956, which had simply revolved around the increasingly mainstream goals for a de- Stalnized socialist party and the establishment of a democratic East German state. On 28 March 1990 the High Court quashed the sentence from 9 March 1957. By this time Steinberger was seriously ill, however, and was unable to attend the court.

This was MLW's first pay-per-view event and the second MLW show held under the SuperFight name. The event aired live on traditional PPV outlets and FITE TV. Twelve matches were contested at the event including four on the pre-show. The main event was a no disqualification match, in which Jacob Fatu defeated LA Park to retain the World Heavyweight Championship. In other prominent matches on the card, Alexander Hammerstone defeated Davey Boy Smith, Jr. to retain the National Openweight Championship, Teddy Hart defeated Austin Aries to retain the World Middleweight Championship, The Von Erichs (Ross and Marshall) defeated The Dynasty (Maxwell J. Friedman and Richard Holliday) in a Texas Tornado match to win the World Tag Team Championship and Mance Warner defeated Jimmy Havoc and Bestia 666 in a Stairway to Hell match. ==Production== Cicero Stadium on the evening of the event ===Background=== In July 2017, Major League Wrestling resumed promoting events for the first time since the promotion's original closure in 2004. The success of these events lead MLW to secure a television deal with beIN Sports for a new program, MLW Fusion, which debuted on April 20, 2018. In November, MLW broke their attendance record with their Fightland event in Chicago at Cicero Stadium. Eventually, MLW began airing live specials on beIN Sports, in which the promotion was broadcast live during Fusion television tapings. MLW's first live special of 2019 was SuperFight, which was held in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania at the 2300 Arena. On July 5, 2019, MLW announced their first pay-per-view event titled Saturday Night SuperFight, which would be held on November 2, 2019 at the Cicero Stadium in Cicero, Illinois. On August 8, MLW announced that they had reached a deal with FITE TV to produce content for their streaming network, with Saturday Night SuperFight being the first MLW event produced for the platform. === Storylines === The event will feature professional wrestling matches that will involved different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers will portray villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and will culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. On April 5, 2019, LA Park won the Battle Riot, earning a \\"Golden Ticket\\" for a MLW World Heavyweight Championship match at any time of his choosing. On September 7, it was announced that LA Park would cash in his \\"Golden Ticket\\" and face MLW Champion Jacob Fatu at Saturday Night SuperFight. ==EventPre-show=== Before the event aired live on pay- per-view, a pre-show aired as a live special episode of Fusion on beIN Sports. In the opening match, Savio Vega took on Leo Brien. Vega avoided a middle rope elbow drop from Brien and attacked him and shoved the referee down, allowing Brien to hit Vega with a cowbell and a diving elbow drop for the win. However, Vega attacked Brien with a kendo stick after the match. Next, Air Wolf took on the debuting Gino Medina. After avoiding a Pele kick by Wolf, Medina hit a knee strike and an Eat Da-Feet for the win. Next, El Hijo de L.A. Park took on Zenshi. After avoiding a 450¬∞ splash by Zenshi, Park nailed a package piledriver to Zenshi for the win. The main event of the pre-show was a three- way tag team match pitting Contra Unit (Simon Gotch and Ikuro Kwon) against Dominic Garrini and Douglas James and The Spirit Squad (Mike Mondo and Kenn Doane). Garrini applied an armbar on Doane but Doane caught the ropes, allowing Kwon to spit mist into Mondo's face and Gotch nailed a cradle piledriver to Mondo for the win. ===Preliminary matches=== Jacob Fatu defended the MLW World Heavyweight Championship against L.A. Park in the main event. The event kicked off with a Texas Tornado match, in which The Dynasty (Maxwell J. Friedman and Richard Holliday) defended the World Tag Team Championship against The Von Erichs (Marshall Von Erich and Ross Von Erich). After dumping Holliday out of the ring, the Von Erichs hit a claw slam to MJF to win the titles. Next, Gringo Loco, Puma King, and Septimo Dragon took on Injustice (Jordan Oliver, Kotto Brazil, and Myron Reed) in a six-man tag team match. Reed delivered a springboard 450¬∞ splash to Dragon for the win. Next, Teddy Hart defended the World Middleweight Championship against Austin Aries. After kicking out of a roll-up by Aries, Hart executed a Hart Destroyer to Aries to retain the title. Next, Low Ki took on Brian Pillman Jr. Pillman threw his mouthguard at Ki and Ki nailed a running somersault kick to Pillman for the win. Next, Tom Lawlor took on Timothy Thatcher. Lawlor made Thatcher submit to the rear naked choke for the win. Later, Bestia 666 took on Jimmy Havoc and Mance Warner in a Stairway to Hell match. Warner drove Bestia through a table with a superplex to win the match. Havoc attacked Warner from behind after the match and nailed a piledriver to Warner on the steel guard rail and delivered an Acid Rainmaker to Warner. This was followed by the penultimate match, in which Alexander Hammerstone defended the National Openweight Championship against Davey Boy Smith Jr. Smith countered a Nightmare Pendulum by Hammerstone into a cradle and a series of cradles between the two culminated with Hammerstone pinning Smith with a schoolboy while grabbing the ropes for leverage to retain the title. ===Main event match=== The main event was a No Disqualification match, in which Jacob Fatu defended the World Heavyweight Championship against L.A. Park. Park avoided a moonsault by Fatu and covered him for the pinfall but Fatu's Contra Unit teammate Josef Samael interfered by throwing a fireball into the referee's eyes and Park tried to hit a spear to Samael but Samael ducked and Salina de la Renta was hit with it being sent through a table. The distraction allowed Fatu to hit a superkick, a pop-up Samoan drop and a moonsault to Park to retain the title. ==Results== ==Gallery== File:MarshallVonErichMLW2019.jpgMarshall Von Erich celebrating after winning the MLW World Tag Team Championship File:RossVonErichMLW2019.jpgRoss Von Erich celebrating after winning the MLW World Tag Team Championship File:ThatcherMLW2019.jpgTimothy Thatcher making his entrance to the ring File:MLWSuperFightStairwaytoHell.jpgThe three-way Stairway to Hell match between Bestia 666, Jimmy Havoc and Mance Warner File:ManceWarnerMLW2019.jpgMance Warner celebrating his victory File:AHammerstoneMLW2019.jpgAlexander Hammerstone making his entrance to the ring to defend the MLW National Openweight Championship File:JosefSamaelMLW2019.jpgJosef Samael accompanying Jacob Fatu to the ring during his entrance ==See also== *2019 in professional wrestling ==References== ==External links== *Saturday Night Superfight official website Category:Major League Wrestling Category:Professional wrestling in the Chicago metropolitan area Category:2010s in Chicago Category:2019 in Illinois Category:Events in Chicago Category:November 2019 events in the United States Category:2019 in professional wrestling ","title":"MLW Saturday Night SuperFight"},{"id":"61245365","text":"Concetta is an Italian female given name.

Jon Dolan of Rolling Stone praised the book, calling it \\"a quietly heroic rock and roll origin story\\" and writing, \\"Those explosively detailed depictions of their earliest experiences trying to find girlfriends are worthy of an excellent YA novel, thanks to Tegan or Sara's unsparingly real, matter- of-fact prose style.\\" Spencer Kornhaber of The Atlantic wrote, \\"While Tegan and Sara are hilarious in their onstage banter, on the page their anecdotes read as spooky, solemn obstacle-running. A melancholy tone runs throughout. Queerness complicates what otherwise might seem like just hijinks.\\" ==Publication history== * * * ==References== Category:2019 non-fiction books Category:English-language books Category:Canadian non-fiction books Category:Canadian memoirs Category:Literary collaborations Category:Tegan and Sara albums Category:Simon & Schuster books Category:Music autobiographies Category:Lesbian non-fiction books Category:LGBT literature in Canada Category:2010s LGBT literature Category:LGBT autobiographies ","title":"High School (book)"},{"id":"61245397","text":"Erika Janeth Hern√°ndez D√≠az (born 17 March 1999) is a Panamanian footballer who plays as a forward for the Panama women's national team. ==International career== Hern√°ndez appeared in five matches for Panama and scored one goal at the 2018 CONCACAF Women's Championship. ==References== Category:1999 births Category:Living people Category:Women's association football forwards Category:Panamanian women's footballers Category:Panama women's international footballers Category:Pan American Games competitors for Panama Category:Footballers at the 2019 Pan American Games ","title":"Erika Hern√°ndez"},{"id":"61245403","text":"Lee Hye-young (born 30 July 1982) is a South Korean taekwondo practitioner.

For NKA, she translated Charlotte's Web, the first time the book had been translated into an indigenous American language. Johnson also translated Charles Frazier's Thirteen Moons, a novel loosely based on the life of William Holland Thomas that depicts the sociopolitical events surrounding the Cherokee removal. The novel was published by the Museum of the Cherokee Indian press. She narrated her translation of Thirteen Moons for the audio book and also narrated Tsogadu Nvdo, a Cherokee language audio book.

He helped Minnesota win its first two National Titles in 1974 and 1976 winning the Tournament MOP for the second. ==Career== Vannelli was a high-scoring forward for St. Paul Academy in his home town, recording 105 points in just 20 games during his senior year. He was part of Herb Brooks' second recruiting class and though limited to just three points in 17 games in his freshman season, Vannelli helped Minnesota win its first National Championship. Vannelli missed only 1 game in his sophomore season and saw his point total ascend to 52, finishing second on the team. Minnesota won the WCHA championship and recorded its first 30-win season but the Gophers were shut down in the championship by Jim Warden of Michigan Tech. Vannelli was named as an alternate captain in his junior season and posted career highs in goals (26) assists (43) and points (69) en route to leading the team in scoring. Vannelli led Minnesota to their third consecutive championship appearance and, unsatisfied with the result in 1975, took matters into his own hands with a 5-point night, 1 away from the tournament record. Vannelli had a hand in 5 of the Gophers' six goals on the night, and was named as the Tournament MOP for his offensive outburst. He remained with Minnesota for his senior season and again led the team in scoring, though the Gophers finished with a losing record. After graduating Vannelli did not attract much attention from professional team despite his scoring totals. His playing career ended the following season after a brief appearance with HC Lugano. Vannelli returned to Minnesota and eventually turned to coaching. He became the head coach for Cretin-Derham Hall HS in 2000 and three years later teamed up with his brother Greg to be the co-coach at nearby Saint Thomas Academy. The Vannelli brothers built a powerhouse in short order, winning 10 section championships, four conference championships and 5 class A State Championships. They moved the program up into class AA late in their tenure and continued to produce stellar results, making three state championships in five years. Tom announced that he was retiring after the 2019 season and while Greg would continue on to lead the transition, Tom did not rule out a future return to coaching. ==References== == External links == * Category:1955 births Category:Living people Category:American men's ice hockey centers Category:Ice hockey people from Minnesota Category:Sportspeople from Saint Paul, Minnesota Category:Minnesota Golden Gophers men's ice hockey players Category:HC Lugano players Category:Minnesota North Stars broadcasters Category:NCAA men's ice hockey national champions ","title":"Tom Vannelli"},{"id":"61245716","text":"Bishop Francis Kalist is the current serving bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Meerut, India. == Early life == Kalist was born on 23 November 1957 in Ritapuram, Tamil Nadu, India. == Priesthood == On 30 December 1982, Kalist was ordained at catholic priest for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Meerut. == Episcopate == Kalist was appointed bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Meerut on 3 Dec 2008 and ordained a bishop on 8 Feb 2009 by Patrick Nair. == See also == * List of Catholic bishops of India == References == Category:Living people Category:1957 births Category:Catholic bishops ","title":"Francis Kalist"},{"id":"61245731","text":"Andrew Watson (born 1894) was a Scottish professional footballer who played as a right back. ==Career== Born in Kirkcaldy,Frost, p. 409 Watson spent his early career with Kirkcaldy United and Bolton Wanderers.

It is positioned 5¬∞ to the SSW of the prominent star Delta Aquilae. This nebula was discovered by German astronomer Albert Marth during the period 1863‚Äì1865. English astronomer John Herschel may have mistakenly catalogued it as NGC 6785, as nothing can be found now at those coordinates. In the New General Catalogue it was described as a \\"small, elongated, ill-defined disk\\". This PNe displays a disrupted morphology, with a roughly S-shaped feature projecting out of an irregular shell, along with linear jet-like forms. The inner part contains a highly distorted elliptical ring oriented along an east-west direction. The nebula and ring have an angular size of and they are about 4,400 years old, while the jets are around 1,700 years old. At the center of the nebula is a close binary star system with an orbital period of just 3.68 hours, one of the shortest known among the binary central stars that form a planetary nebulae. Their proximity to each other provides strong evidence that they have passed through a common-envelope (CE) phase earlier in their evolution. The pair may now consist of a primary star with , a red dwarf secondary companion having , and a semimajor axis of only . The surrounding nebula is inclined about 85¬∞ to the line of sight from the Earth. The torus of this nebula is notable for its high expansion velocity, measured at up to 60‚Äì70 km/s. It displays collimated outflows, possibly as a result of the CE behavior of the central stars or else a short-lived accretion disk. The pair of jets are located along a position angle of 15¬∞, showing fast outflow with radial velocities of around 100 km/s. The nebula is notable for the rich amount of filamentary \\"low-ionization structures\\", or LIS, resembling the wispy structures of nova explosions. These too may be the result of the CE interaction. In addition to a higher than normal helium abundance, the nebula displays unusually strong optical recombination lines from heavier elements; one of the highest known among PNe. These may be the result of a very late thermal pulse, or \\"final flash\\", following the initial ejection of the stellar envelope that formed the nebula. The pulse would have ejected chemically-enriched material into the old nebula, changing its abundances. ==References== == External links == * Category:Planetary nebulae Category:Binary stars Category:Aquila (constellation) 6778 ","title":"NGC 6778"},{"id":"61245745","text":"Gustavo Re (7 April 1908 ‚Äì 5 June 1979) was a Spanish television presenter and actor. ==Biography== On 10 October 1961 it was aired on TVE Amigos del martes, hosted by Artur Kaps, Franz Johan and Gustavo Re.

He founded the Battery Dance Company in New York City in 1976, opening the Battery Dance Studio that same year. He also founded the Downtown Dance Festival, held annually in New York City since 1982. Since 2008, the Downtown Dance Festival has included the Erasing Borders Festival of Indian Dance. As a dance educator, Hollander has been active in bringing dance into the public schools; and is known for the award-winning \\"Dancing to Connect\\" program. He is also known for his ties to India, and for presenting and promoting Indian dancers in New York. He is a co-founder of the Indo-American Arts Council. ==Early life and education== Hollander is the son of Joan Wolman Hollander, a pianist, and Bernard Moses Hollander, an anti- trust attorney employed by the United States Department of Justice. The dancer was born in Washington, D.C., and grew up in Chevy Chase, Maryland, where he studied piano for 13 years with Robert Parris, Charles Crowder and Ylda Novik. He studied folk dancing as a child at the Chilmark Community Center in Chilmark, Massachusetts; and received his first theatrical experience at the Interlochen National Music Camp, in Interlochen, Michigan, where he performed in a production staged by American choreographer Carolyn Carlson. Hollander traveled to India in 1968 as an American Field Service Exchange Student, where he was first exposed to Indian dance in the class of Parvati Kumar. He began his own, formal dance training while a student at the University of California Irvine, where he studied with Eugene Loring, James Penrod and Janice Plastino. ==Career== Hollander left college to pursue a dance career in New York City. There his teachers included Merce Cunningham, Margaret Craske, Dan Wagoner, Dianna Byer, Janet Panetta, and Ann Parson at the Joffrey Ballet School. He first performed for choreographer Twyla Tharp in 1971; and danced with the New York Dance Collective from 1971-1975, before launching his own studio and dance troupe in 1976. The studio was located at 54 Stone Street in New York City from 1976-1984; and is currently at 380 Broadway. Battery Dance Company is considered a pioneer in expanding New York's arts scene to lower Manhattan. \\"Cultural activity first surfaced on Wall Street in the early 1970s. Two avant-garde groups, Battery Dance Company and Creative Time,..were founded in lower Manhattan to take advantage of the vacuum of contemporary art and the potential audience of some 500,000 people.\\" In addition to offering dance classes, the Battery Dance Studio has been the site of salon events featuring such notable Indian artists as Mallika Sarabhai; the Jhaveri Sisters; Sandip Mallick; and Nirupana and Rajendra. The Battery Dance Company has also presented such notable artists as C.V. Chandrasekhar; Tero Saarinen; and Tommi Kitti, and has played host to K. Jayan, Isheeta Ganguly, and the Silesian Dance Theatre of Poland. Swapnasundari and her troupe of Kathakali dancers appeared at the Downtown Dance Festival, making their New York debut. The Janavak National Folk Dance Troupe of India toured the United States in 2001 under the auspices of Battery Dance Company. Hollander spent three months in India as a Fulbright Lecturer on Dance in 1992, during which time he deepened his connections to the Indian dance community. He taught workshops at the Darpana and Kadamb Institutions in Ahmedabad, M.S. University in Baroda, Nalanda Dance Institute and NCPA in Mumbai; and his company undertook a six- city tour of India. The following year he organized the American debut and tour of the Jhaveri Sisters, renowned exponents of Manipuri Dance. In 1995, Hollander curated \\"PURUSH: Expressions of Man,\\" a program celebrating male performers representing various classical Indian dance styles including Bharata Natyam, Kathak, Kuchipudi, and Kathakali. This program made its debut at The Music Centre in Chennai; appeared at the Lincoln Center Out-of-Doors Festival; and undertook an 18-city tour of the United States.

Her father, who was born in Denmark and came to America in 1899, was a chemist, industrialist, and art collector. ==Education and career== Lihme was educated at Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Connecticut, and attended Vassar College. She had a successful career as an amateur golfer, and before her first marriage, was \\"woman champion of the Misquamicut Golf Club at Watch Hill.\\" Lihme, who was known professionally as Mrs. Lobkowicz, began working as a real estate broker in 1951 and served as the vice president of Douglas Gibbons-Hollyday & Ives, until her retirement in 1972. ==Personal life== Anita's son on his wedding day in 1960. On 29 August 1925, Lihme married Prince Edward Joseph de Lobkowicz (1899‚Äì1959) in a Catholic ceremony at Watch Hill Union Chapel in Watch Hill, Rhode Island. A reception was held at her family's summer home, Normal Hall. He was a son of the former Countess Palermy of Bohemia and Prince August de Lobkowicz, Privy Counselor and Lord Chamberlain to the Emperor Franz Josef. After their marriage they lived at 280 Park Avenue, and later, 164 East 72nd Street, in New York City. Before Prince Edward's death in Freiburg, Germany in January 1959, they were the parents of three children, two boys and a girl: * Prince Edouard de Lobkowicz (1926‚Äì2010), who married Princess Marie-Fran√ßoise of Bourbon-Parma, the eldest daughter of Prince Xavier of Bourbon-Parma and of his wife, Madeleine de Bourbon-Busset. Their son was found dead in Paris in 1984. * Prince George Christian de Lobkowica (1928‚Äì1950), who died unmarried at age twenty-one. * Princess Anita Olga de Lobkowicz (b. 1937), who married Count Charles-Louis de Coss√©-Brissac, a son of the Marquis de Coss√©, in the fall of 1958. After the death of her first husband, Anita married Erwin Hoy Watts, at St. Vincent Ferrer's Church in Manhattan in May 1960. Watts, a son of Ridley Watts and descendant of Henry Grinnell who had served with the Office of Strategic Services during World War II, won the Croix de Guerre for heroism as a volunteer ambulance driver with the American Field Service in France. After the war he joined the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration that aided displaced persons in Greece. Watts, who had previously been married to Alice Wheelock and Elizabeth S. Peet, died in 1964. On 15 January 1972, Lihme married a third time to American business executive John Carroll Griswold in an ecumenical ceremony at Brick Presbyterian Church in Manhattan. The ceremony, a joint Catholic and Presbyterian wedding, was performed by Monsignor James G. Wilders of St. Thomas More Catholic Church and the Rev. Dr. Victor L. Baer of Brick Presbyterian. Griswold, a son of Harry Ross Griswold, was the founder and president of Griswold & Co., an insurance brokerage company that was acquired by Marsh & McLennan. At the time of their wedding, he was a senior vice president and director of Eastman Dillon, Union Securities & Co., Inc. investment bankers and brokers. From his first marriage to Marguerite Bessire, he was the father of David Ross Griswold and a daughter who married John Vincent Earl. She died on May 14, 1976 at her home, 50 East 77th Street in New York City. After a funeral at St. Thomas More's Roman Catholic Church, she was buried in Fairlawn Cemetery in Macon County, Illinois. == References == ==External links== * Category:1903 births Category:1976 deaths Category:American female golfers Category:Golfers from Illinois Category:American real estate brokers Category:American women business executives Category:American people of Dutch descent Category:American people of German descent Category:American Roman Catholics Anita Category:Griswold family Category:Lobkowicz Category:Princesses by marriage Category:People from Chicago Category:Vassar College alumni Category:Miss Porter's School alumni ","title":"Anita Lihme"},{"id":"61246388","text":"Rosa 'Francis Meilland', also known as 'Schloss Ippenburg' or 'Prince Jardinier', is a light pink Hybrid tea rose cultivar.

Records of the Bureau of the Census, 1790 - 2007, RG 29. Washington, D.C.: National Archives and Records Administration, 2012. Ralph Cotter was a plant pathologist at the University of Minnesota; growing up, Shirley Cotter would play in the university's greenhouses. Cotter maintained her interest in botany as an undergraduate student at the University of Minnesota; during this time, she collected over 4000 herbarium specimens. Her collection emphasized lichens. In 1951, Cotter became a graduate student in botany at University of California, Davis, studying under Katherine Esau. During her graduate studies, Cotter met Kenneth Tucker. They married in 1953. Shirley Cotter Tucker earned her doctorate in botany in 1956. Her dissertation was titled Ontogeny of the Inflorescence and the Flower in Drimys winteri var. chilensis. After graduating, Tucker had trouble finding permanent work at a university or college that would give her access to research funding. Instead, she sought external funding, receiving her first grant from the National Science Foundation in 1957. For 10 years, Tucker worked in temporary, non-tenure track university positions. She developed her work on lichens during this time, as a way around her lack of access to a laboratory. In 1968, Tucker was hired as a tenure track assistant professor at Louisiana State University, where she taught botany. In 1982, she earned the rank of Boyd Professor, the highest distinction awarded by the LSU Board of Supervisors. Tucker was the president of the Botanical Society of America in 1987-88. She was also the president of the American Society of Plant Taxonomists. Tucker and her husband both retired in 1995. They moved to Santa Barbara, California and became involved with the Santa Barbara Botanic Garden, including establishing an endowment for a staff plant systematist. Tucker also taught part time at University of California, Santa Barbara. In 1999, the University of Minnesota honored Tucker with an Outstanding Achievement Award. In 2014, Kenneth Tucker died. The next year Shirley Cotter Tucker made a gift to the Center for Plant Diversity which named the fund the \\"Shirley and Kenneth Tucker Fund\\" in their honor.

The book has had significant influence on the field of medieval studies, even as its methods and style of argumentation are viewed with wariness by contemporary scholars. It is the recipient of the Haskin's medal from the Medieval Academy of America. Stephen Greenblatt has said that the book is a \\"remarkably vital, generous, and generative work,\\" while the historian Morimichi Watanabe called it a \\"monumental classic.\\" Others have called it both an \\"an unnoticed volume on the shelves\\" while remaining important and influential in disciplines including art history. It is also said to have more admirers than readers. Horst Bredekamp, an art historian, has referred to the book as a \\"continuous success\\". It has been kept in print since 1957 by Princeton University Press and has been translated into French, German, and Italian. Scholarly technique in the book includes use of art, philosophy, religion, law, numismatics, and archaeology. == Background == The King's Two Bodies is described by historian Paul Monod as \\"boldly conceived, meticulously researched, and beautifully written.\\" It attempts to show how a monarchical state developed out of Christian religious beliefs, specifically as articulated in mid-Tudor England. At that time, English legal doctrine saw the physical body of the ruler as joined to a \\"perfect, immutable and eternal body of the whole polity.\\" Kantorowicz then argues that this is a culmination of Catholic teachings about the body of Christ. == Structure == The book is structured around an exploration of the numerous devices and technologies medieval theologians and lawyers developed to \\"defeat death\\" and \\"extend bodily existence far beyond carnal boundaries.\\" Kantorowicz's magnum opus does not follow a linear or chronological structure. Some scholars have said it is \\"free-minded and unsystematic,\\" like \\"a happy society of fairies and spiders had come together to weave a learned web.\\" It begins with an introduction to the theme of the King's \\"two bodies\\" as found in the reports of Edward Plowden, an Elizabethan jurist. It then revisits the appearance of the same ideas as developed by Shakespeare in King Richard II. The problem and its horizon of enquiry has now been established for the reader: what makes the \\"juridical fiction\\" of the symbolic body of the king possible? The author's excavation of these threads was not without controversy. Among Edmund Plowden's Reports, for instance, was a dispute over whether or not King Edward VI held the duchy of Lancaster as private property, or whether it belonged to the crown. The lawyer's argued the latter: > the king has in him two Bodies, viz., a Body natural, and a Body politic. > His Body natural (if it be considered in itself) is a Body mortal, subject > to all Infirmities that come by Nature or Accident, to the Imbecility of > Infancy or old Age ‚Ä¶ But his Body politic is a Body that cannot be seen or > handled, consisting of Policy and Government, and constituted for the > Direction of the People, and the management of the public weal, and this > Body is utterly void of Infancy, and old Age, and other natural Defects and > Imbecilities, which the Body natural is subject to, and for this Cause, what > the King does in his Body politic, cannot be invalidated or frustrated by > any Disability in his natural Body. While medievalist F.W. Maitland saw in remarks like this \\"metaphysical nonsense,\\" Kantorowicz's perceived \\"a mystical fiction with theological roots, unconsciously transferred by Tudor jurists to the myth of the State. The remainder of the text ‚Äî the argument proper ‚Äî then turns to \\"Christ-centered Kingship,\\" \\"Law-centered Kingship\\" and \\"Polity-centered Kingship.\\" These are a rough taxonomy of the multiple manifestations of mystical and corporeal kingship, which Kantorowicz's tracks throughout history in a variety of cultures. The final three sections address respectively continuity and corporations (drawing on F. W. Maitland's analysis of \\"The Crown as Corporation\\"), the immortality of the king (as transcendental, not physical, body) and \\"Man-centered kingship\\" which contains a close discussion of the work of Dante Alighieri. == Reception and influence == A primary reason for a revival of interest in Kantorowicz's work in the post-WWII era was the use of the work by Michel Foucault in his classic Discipline and Punish, where he drew a parallel between the duality of the king and the body of a man condemned. Reworking's of (and homages to) Kantorowicz's title have included The Queen's Two Bodies, The Pope's Body, The King's Two Maps, the People's Two Bodies, the King's Other Body, and more. One of the more notable controversies involving Kantorowicz's legacy was the claim by Norman Cantor that he was one of two \\"Nazi twins\\" (the other being Percy Ernst Schramm, an actual member of the Nazi party) due to the popular reception of his book on Frederick the Second among Nazis. Cantor's arguments however were later regarded as a twisting of facts and a \\"massive libel.\\" == Lineage in Kantorowicz's work == Scholars in recent years have traced the origins of the King's Two Bodies to Kantorowicz's specific time and place in 1920s and 1930s Germany, and driven in part by his wish to respond to contemporaneous theories about the theological origins of modern sovereignty. Likely due to the polarizing reception of Kantorowicz's first book about the life of Frederick IITranslated to English as Frederick the Second: 1194 - 1250. (Kaiser Friedrich der Zweite) due to its lack of footnotes, Kantorowicz did rigorous research for The King's Two Bodies and cites heavily throughout the book. In Frederick II, the ruler was shown to be the founder of the secular state, at that point a new type of political entity that expressed the wishes of a lay culture that had been spreading for a century in Europe. Scholars draw a direct lineage of intellectual ambitions from the early to late Kantorowicz. In Frederick II ideas about the relation between the monarch and the state are proposed but only fulfilled in the Tudor legal doctrine Kantorowicz elaborates and interprets in The King's Two Bodies: that \\"a successful secular state\\" finds its basis in \\"an all-encompassing body politic housed in the monarch‚Äôs body.\\" Kantorowicz also believed that the doctrines advocated by these jurists-cum- theologians were ultimately fictitious yet emotionally satisfying. He believed that any political theory is based not on truth but non-rational psychological power. William Shakespeare's play Richard II includes many themes relevant to the book including conceptions of the body politic. Kantorowicz was concerned with the problem of ideas from the theological or religious world being transferred to the secular, a process that he believed characterized modernity. Thus, theological ideas are made juridical; liturgical political; and the notion of Christendom becomes a \\"humanistic community of mankind.\\" ==References== Category:1957 non-fiction books Category:Princeton University Press books Category:Works about monarchy Category:Political theology ","title":"The King's Two Bodies"},{"id":"61246562","text":"Martin Bianchi (born 11 February 1981) is an Argentine cross-country skier.

Warner Bros. announced that a crossover featuring the Titans from both series was in the works.

The film had its first ever television premiere on Cartoon Network on February 17, 2020. The film received generally positive reviews from critics. ==Plot== The film opens with the Teen Titans Go! team battling the Gentleman Ghost as he attempts to rob a bank. He manages to possess Robin and then Starfire, but when attempting the same trick on Raven, he unintentionally cracks her gem, which unleashes some of her inner demonic power and results in his defeat. Trigon reveals that Raven's demonic half is slowly taking over her and offers to take it away, but she refuses to give it to him. Suddenly, the Titans are abducted by the Master of Games, a being who explores the multiverse with his Worlogog to find the best versions of particular heroes. He pits the 2013 Titans against the original 2003 animated Titans, who agree to fight after the Master of Games threatens to destroy their Earths. 2003 Robin and Cyborg manage to take out all of the 2013 Titans with the exception of Raven. She is coerced into unleashing her demonic power against the 2003 Raven, who snaps her out of it when she realizes the Master of Games is siphoning her demonic energy. The Master of Games then reveals himself to be 2013 Trigon, who uses Raven's energy to resurrect 2003 Trigon. The two Trigons kidnap the Ravens and escape to the 2003 Earth to finish absorbing 2013 Raven's powers so they can conquer the multiverse. The two Titans teams agree to work together to stop the Trigons and rescue their Ravens. 2003 Robin deduces that the Trigons are using a Worlogog from their Earth to travel between dimensions, so they need a Worlogog from the 2013 dimension, which the 2013 Titans realize belongs to Santa Claus. The two teams battle Santa and Mrs. Claus and escape by using the device to travel between dimensions and eventually make it to the 2003 Earth just after 2003 Trigon completely absorbs 2013 Raven's powers. Fed up with his counterpart's insults, 2013 Trigon consumes 2003 Trigon and transforms into a new powerful being named Hexagon. To combat this new threat, 2003 Robin uses their Worlogog to summon Titans teams throughout the multiverse to form the \\"Titans of Infinite Earths\\", but to no avail. 2013 Raven evens the odds by absorbing all of her counterparts and transforms into a dragon known as \\"The Unkindness\\". The Titans destroy Trigon's Worlogog and assist Raven in getting her powers back, which sends 2003 Trigon into limbo while 2013 Robin uses their Worlogog to send 2013 Trigon to a zombie dimension. After 2013 Raven accepts her demonic half, all of the Titans are sent home to their respective dimensions. Upon returning to their Earth, the 2013 Titans express relief that they do not have to endure another multiverse-threatening crossover for at least another year. Just then, they are attacked by Darkseid, but refuse to battle him out of exhaustion. In a post-credit scene, the 2013 Titans relax at their headquarters, ignoring Darkseid's attack upon Jump City. ==Cast== * Scott Menville as Robin * Tara Strong as Raven * Khary Payton as Cyborg * Hynden Walch as Starfire * Greg Cipes as Beast Boy * Kevin Michael Richardson as Trigon and Hexagon * Robert Morse as Santa Claus * Grey Griffin as Mrs. Claus and Bank Teller * Rhys Darby as Master of Games * Sean Maher as Nightwing (DC Animated Movie Universe) * \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic as Gentleman Ghost and Uxas / Darkseid ==Release== The film premiered at the San Diego Comic-Con on July 21, 2019, to be followed by a digital release on September 24, 2019, and a DVD and Blu-ray release on October 15, 2019. ==Reception== The film has received positive reviews from critics.

He is notable for being involved in the early politics of British Asians and pioneering social welfare work for the working-class diaspora in the United Kingdom. He was the first ever Sylheti to open up a restaurant in the United Kingdom, and his restaurants were one of the earliest Indian restaurants at the time. Another one of his restaurants, India Centre, often provided facilities and was a location where important meetings were held by the India League attracting the likes of Subhas Chandra Bose and V. K. Krishna Menon. ==Early life== Qureshi came from a traditional Bengali Muslim family claiming descent from the Arab tribe of Quraysh. He was born in the Patli village of Jagannathpur in the Sylhet District of the British Raj's Assam Province on the 25th of September 1915. He was the eldest child and had two brothers and a sister. The family residence in Patli was known as Quresh Bari and his father owned some land. However, his father's main goal was to educate his children which was extremely expensive leading to him sell nearly all his land. This led to Qureshi being well educated during his youth. Qureshi decided to become a lascar after being inspired by many other Sylheti men and moved to Calcutta in 1934. He believed that seafaring was a historical inheritance of Sylhetis due to many Sylhetis being descendants of foreign traders and businessmen. During his stay in the port city, he attempted to jump on ships going to the United States. In 1936, at his early 20s, Qureshi successfully attempted to jump on a ship on its way to New York City. However, he failed but ended up at the Tilbury Docks in Essex. ==Career== Qureshi's first job in the United Kingdom consisted of selling chocolates. After getting into contact with other British Asians, he began working in South Asian cuisine restaurants such as Bengal Restaurant in Percy Street. After two years of living in the United Kingdom, Qureshi opened his first restaurant, Dilkush, which was located in Soho's Windmill Street.India Office Records, Asian and African Studies Reading Room, British Library, St Pancras This was the first restaurant to be opened by a Sylheti person. The restaurant, located near Tottenham Court Road, was destroyed by a bomb in 1940. On 9 May 1943, Qureshi founded the Indian Seamen's Union with a purpose of promoting social welfare of working-class British Asians alongside his acquaintance Ayub Ali Master. Based in Christian Street, the organisation ensured the rights of Asians and made it easier for them to communicate to their family abroad. On 14 July 1943, the first meeting took place, in King's Hall, Commercial Street, London. The meeting attracted mostly Bengali Muslims but dozens of Europeans were also present. Later, the organisation was renamed to the Indian Seamen's Welfare League to sound less political and Qureshi was made president of the welfare league. The following year, Qureshi opened another restaurant off Charlotte Street which came to be known as the India Centre. The India Centre was frequently visited by British Asians, in particular politicians, who held important communal and political meetings there. Qureshi also assisted and attended V. K. Krishna Menon's India League and Surat Alley's Hindustani Social Club meetings. He was also involved with the Indian National Congress and was in contact with the likes of Subhas Chandra Bose. Later on, he became a member of the London Muslim League. In 1946, Qureshi returned to Sylhet, where he got married and lived there for over two decades before returning to the United Kingdom with his family in the 1970s. ==Legacy== His sons continue to own South Asian cuisine restaurants in the United Kingdom. ==See also== * Aftab Ali * Ayub Ali Master *British Bangladeshi * I'tisam-ud-Din ==References== Category:British restaurateurs Category:1915 births Category:2003 deaths Category:British Muslims Category:Bangladeshi emigrants to England Category:English people of Bangladeshi descent Category:Bangladeshi people of Arab descent Category:British chefs Category:Bangladeshi businesspeople Category:Businesspeople from London Category:British chief executives Category:British company founders Category:Chefs of Indian cuisine Category:20th-century British businesspeople Category:English Muslims Category:People from Jagannathpur Upazila Category:20th-century Muslims Category:21st-century Muslims Category:All India Muslim League members ","title":"Shah Abdul Majid Qureshi"},{"id":"61247474","text":"Park Dong-seon is a South Korean taekwondo practitioner.

In the , Sosa was the candidate for prefect of Esmeraldas Province for the Democratic People's Movement (MPD). She was elected with 47,579 votes, breaking the hold the Ecuadorian Roldosist Party (PRE) had had on the office for eight years. While prefect, she gave birth to twins in July 2012. ==Prefect of Esmeraldas Province== On January 5, 2005, Luc√≠a Sosa took office as prefect of Esmeraldas.

During incidents on the Ecuadorian border with members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), she indicated that she had asked the Correa regime for more surveillance of the border by monitoring the northern zone by helicopter, but the idea was not acted on by the government.

The site consists of the remains of a round tower and several high crosses, including one outstanding example. It is currently also the site of a Church of Ireland parish church and a graveyard. It is the burial place of the poet William Butler Yeats. Founded in the 6th century by Saint Colmcille, he is said to have declared in a later literary fragment > Beloved to my heart also in the West‚Äî Drumcliffe at Culcinne's strand. ==Location== Drumcliff was founded as a monastery in 574 AD, at the base of Benbulben by Saint Colmcille in the territory of Cairbre Drom Cliabh, an area ruled by the Cinel Cairbre descendants of Cairbre Mac Neill son of Niall of the Nine Hostages the founder of the Ui Neill dynasty. The site was probably donated by the northern Ui Neill High king and relative of Colmcille, Aed Ainmire. The monastery was located on the south bank of the river Codhnach, now the Drumcliff river that runs from Glencar lake to the sea at Drumcliff bay. The monastery was on land near the site of the Battle Of The Book that took place about the year 560, 15 years before the monasteries foundation. Colmcille had taken part in this battle. The termonn lands attached to the monastery were at the modern townland of Ardtermon (meaning \\"High Sanctuary\\") several miles to the west. ==History== The early church in Ireland may have been organised in imitation of the Diocesan model, which was an urban model with metropolitan Bishops having power. This quickly gave way to a monastic system organised in a more decentralised manner more suited to the Irish system of political organisation. Clans and their territories, known as tuatha, were organised into confederations, and the Irish monasteries began to conform to this pattern, with the founder of a monastery becoming, in a similar way to the founder of a dynasty, the head of, in Latin, a familia or paruchia, a group of confederated monasteries. Drumcliff was an early member of the \\"paruchia Columbae\\", the confederation of monasteries that was headquartered at Iona. The Cen√©l Conaill dynasty, to which Colmcille himself belonged, was the chief patron and ally of the confederation from its founding until the eighth century. The Columban paruchia in Ireland flourished during the eighth century AD under the aegis of the Southern U√≠ N√©ill branch of the Clann Cholm√°in. This power was both ecclesiastical and political through alliances with secular rulers. Thereafter in the ninth century it was eclipsed in power by the Patrician paruchia based at Armagh. The reign of the Cen√©l nEogain overking √Åed Oirdnide, was detrimental to Columban fortunes, as this king was openly hostile towards the Columban community https://aran.library.nuigalway.ie/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10379/2943/2011HumphreyPhD.pdf?sequence=1 Armagh, the head of the Patrician paruchia, saw itself as the ‚ÄòRome of the Irish‚Äô,and sought to extend its power using its associations with Patrick, and therefore Rome, and also to take asdvantage of the fact that the Columban federation had been mired in controversy during the debates over Easter. Increasing Viking attacks also took their toll, leading in 804 to the relocation of the head of the Columban monasteries from Iona to Kells. The Columban federation enjoyed close relations with the Ceile De and Drumcliff may have had a community of this group. A Saint Thorian or Mothorian was appointed the first abbot or comharba (successor) of St Columba. A later abbot, Saint Torannon who died in 921 AD, was regarded as the patron of the area.https://www.libraryireland.com/topog/D/Drumcliffe-Carbery-Sligo.php He believed the top of Ben Bulben was the closest to heaven in Ireland. The Erenagh of Drumcliff were O' Beollain (Boland) and O'Coineil. ===Cill Muadhnat=== To the east of the monastery in the townland of Ballynagalliagh (Baile na Caillech), or in the townland of Keelty, the location remains uncertain, was a church dedicated to Saint Muadhnat. She is said to be one of the three \\"daughters of Nadfraech\\" and sister of Saint Molaise of Devenish. The other two sisters are Saint Osnat and Saint Tallulah (Tuilelaith) of Kildare. The 12th century text the Colloquy of the Sages mentions while describing a journey of the Fenian warriors through the district that they travelled \\"to Cailli in Chosnuma, called Cill Muadnatan.\\" Saint Osnats church exists in the valley of Glencar, formerly Geann Dallain, nearby. Around 1223 the church lands at Ballynagalliagh became attached to the Arroasian Augustinian convent at Kilcreevanty near Tuam. This order was known for providing service to travellers. ===Annal entries=== * 574/5 Mothorianus first abbot.https://celt.ucc.ie//published/T201040/index.html * 871 Dunadhach, son of Raghallach, Lord of Cinel Cairbre-Mor, Protector of the roaring shore, pious warrior of the sons of Conn, was interred under hazel crosses in Drumcliff.

From the 13th century Sligo abbey became the preferred burial place for the local Gaelic dynasty of O Conchobar Sligigh. The last monks are mentioned as present in 1503, although when it was finally abandoned is unknown. In 1537 Henry introduced legislation in the Irish parliament to dissolve the Irish houses. This could not be acted on until the Tudor conquest had been extended to Connacht during the last decade of the 16th century. Lands belonging to the monastery were transferred to the new church of Ireland Diocese of Elphin. An inquisition of the 17th century states that there stood at Drumcliff \\"a certain vaulted stone house known as Teach O Connell\\" and also \\"a church and a house belonging to the parson of Drumcliff at the west end of the church. ==Present Site== Samuel Lewis in 1837 mentions that some remains of monastic buildings were then still visible. https://www.libraryireland.com/topog/D/Drumcliffe-Carbery-Sligo.php A round tower survives at the western end of the site. An early Christian cross slab was found in the graveyard. There are four high crosses known so far from Drumcliff. The sandstone shaft of a cross stands near the entrance, it has a mortise for a cross piece that is now missing. Sections of another cross are built into the interior wall of the church, these were discovered during repairs in 1999. Decorative patterns are visible on this cross. Three sections of a cross are also held by the national museum. The west face has the mocking of Christ and the Resurrection, the east, Daniel in the Lions den and the sacrifice of Isaac. ===The High Cross=== The main high cross is the only example of its kind surviving in county Sligo. It is carved in the Urnes style. It has been dated tentatively on artistic grounds to the 9th or 10th century. It measures 3 metres (10 feet) high x 1.1m arms span, the shaft is 47 cm wide by 31 cm. The west face shows scenes from the New Testament, the east face shows scenes from the Old Testament. There is considerable debate about interpretation of these scenes, many of which remain uncertain.https://irishhighcrosses.com/sligo-crosses.html The cross has the only known representation of the Virgin Mary and child on any cross in Ireland, on the south face of the cross arm. The cross gives prominence to the infancy cycle of John the Baptist, a story known from the apocraphyl Protoevangelion of James, attributed to James the brother of Jesus. John the Baptist was a particular focus of the Columban monastic tradition.https://aran.library.nuigalway.ie/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10379/2943/2011HumphreyPhD.pdf?sequence=1 West face of the Celtic High Cross at Drumcliff, Sligo The west face consists of * 3 figures facing to the front, the central figure holds a child diagonally across her body.

The terminal is served by Amtrak's Cardinal line, passing through Cincinnati three times weekly. The building's largest tenants are the Cincinnati Museum Center, a group of three museums, a library, and a theater, as well as the Holocaust & Humanity Center. The terminal was developed throughout the 1920s as a solution for Cincinnati's five train stations serving seven railroads. The cramped stations were close to the Ohio River, which created regular flooding issues. The Great Flood of 1884, one of the largest floods at that time, particularly prompted efforts to consolidate services in a new terminal. Numerous committees developed plans between 1908 and 1923, but construction only started in 1928. The project involved creation of viaducts, mail and express buildings, and utility structures: a power plant, water treatment facility, and roundhouse. The station building's site necessitated demolishing numerous structures and relandscaping and repurposing Lincoln Park. While construction was taking place, the design plans evolved. The architectural firm Fellheimer & Wagner originally conceived a conservative design, though the terminal's development company urged the firm to hire Paul Philippe Cret in 1930, and the terminal's Art Deco design is credited to him. The design, more modern and cheerful, came along with cost savings over the originally- planned intricate designs. The station opened on March 19, 1933, and initially was not well utilized, as the Great Depression led to declined passenger travel. At the onset of World War II, passenger traffic increased significantly, and three United Service Organizations recreation centers opened for troops to use within the terminal. In the next two decades after the war, passenger use declined significantly, as Americans had taken to affordable individual automobiles and airplanes for long-distance travel. A science museum opened in 1968, offsetting some of the building's maintenance costs until it closed in 1970. Amtrak, the national railroad service, was formed in 1971 to rescue declining railroad companies. Amtrak recognized significant operating costs and moved its Cincinnati services to stop at the smaller, new River Road station in 1972. The station's concourse, platforms, and tracks were sold to the Southern Railway for freight operations. The company tore down the terminal's concourse in 1974, after giving the community time to save its artwork. Starting in 1978, a shopping mall was built within the terminal, opening in 1980, though the last tenant left by 1985. Around this time, the Cincinnati Historical Society and Cincinnati Museum of Natural History were looking for new museum space, and led the county to approve funding to transform the building into a museum. The renovation restored some original spaces and included creation of the museum's Omnimax theater. The museum center officially opened in 1991, and its renovations spurred Amtrak to return service to the terminal that year. In 1998, the Cinergy Children's Museum joined the Cincinnati Museum Center. In 2016, the county funded an extensive renovation throughout the building, also supported by grants, donations, and tax credits. The two-year renovation cleaned and repaired artwork, the main exterior clock, the plaza and fountain, walls, and roofs. Following reopening, in early 2019, the Nancy & David Wolf Holocaust and Humanity Center became an additional museum tenant at Union Terminal. ==Background== Pennsylvania Station, one of five replaced by Union Terminal Cincinnati was a major center of railroad traffic in the late 19th and early 20th century, especially as an interchange point between railroads serving the Northeastern and Midwestern states with railroads serving the South. The city's stations were not effective for interchanges: only one of Cincinnati's seven railroads operated through the city; for all the others Cincinnati was a terminal point. For travelers passing through the city by rail, they would often have to travel between two of the city's five stations, forcing them to navigate local transit themselves. It also required companies like the Louisville and Nashville Railroad to split its operations between two stations. Additionally, the stations were cramped, because they were not large enough to support the city's passenger traffic. Cincinnati's stations were also located close to the Ohio River, which was prone to flooding and would frequently render the buildings useless. After the Great Flood of 1884, railroad presidents began seeking one major terminal located far from the river. Committees of railroad executives formed to discuss the topic on numerous occasions between 1908 and 1923. C. A. Wilson was hired by the railroad companies to plan the terminal; he created several schematics between 1912 and 1923. In 1923, the Cincinnati Railroad Development Company was created to spur creation of the terminal and assess its feasibility; former Philip Carey Company president George Dent Crabbs became its president. During the midst of planning, the Depression of 1920‚Äì21 and World War I interrupted efforts to create the union station. A final agreement for a union station among the seven railroads that served Cincinnati and the city itself was not achieved until July 1927, after intense lobbying and negotiations, led by Crabbs. The seven railroads‚Äìthe Baltimore and Ohio Railroad; Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad; New York Central Railroad (through its subsidiary, the Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway, or \\"the Big Four\\"); Louisville and Nashville Railroad; Norfolk and Western Railway; Pennsylvania Railroad; and the Southern Railway‚Äìselected a site for their new station in the West End, near the Mill Creek. Four of the seven railroads already utilized the Mill Creek Valley, which naturally lent itself as a good site for a terminal. At the time, the Southern Railway had a train yard and local freight terminal at the site. Henry M. Waite, Chief Engineer, and C. A. Wilson, Consulting Engineer, organized about 100 engineers and assistants, and came up with seven studies, labeled A through H, of different track and building layouts in the Mill Creek valley. These ranged from the most costly, at $55.6 million, to the cheapest and chosen option, H, at $39.5 million. ==Design considerations and Art Deco origins == June 1931 elevation and floor plan drawings After a limited architectural competition, the firm Fellheimer & Wagner was commissioned to design the terminal in June 1928, shortly after completing their work on Buffalo Central Terminal. The firm first released plans for the terminal in June 1929. The sketches showed a conservative design, utilizing large Gothic arches, vaulted ceilings, and conventional benches in long rows. The originally proposed shape of the rotunda and concourse were the same as the finished product, though the details of the design more closely resembled the architects' Buffalo Central Terminal. The main exterior facade was presented in a similar way to the final product, however somewhat less modern in its details. At this point, most other details of the structure were the same: the semi-circular bus, taxi, and streetcar ramps, the relandscaping of Lincoln Park, and the relative locations of all the rooms in the building. The building was then estimated to cost $8 million, with the total project costing $40.6 million. There were persistent changes in the blueprints between 1931 and 1932, indicating the involvement of an architect outside the firm's regular staff, like Paul Philippe Cret, employed as an aesthetic advisor. He is attributed with the terminal's Art Deco design due to his similar-style designs of other buildings at the time. His submission of a plan for the Chrysler Exhibition Building, in the 1933 Century of Progress world's fair, has numerous similarities to the terminal's final plan and design. The new Art Deco design was approved with its proposed cost savings in mind; an issue the terminal company valued as the Great Depression continued on. Henry Waite said that the first Neoclassical plan would have been cold and costly, and that the new structure was plain, but brightened with color along lines of modern decoration and art. The architects first tried a moderate color scheme, which had a depressing effect. They then decided the terminal should be bright and cheery, like the flowers and birds of the open country. They reported that the effect was joyous and stimulating. Pierre Bourdelle may have been considered to design all art in the terminal, as he made sketches for art throughout the entire terminal. Winold Reiss, who may have been introduced to the project by Paul Philippe Cret, used his source material more faithfully. That may have been significant in Reiss's selection for the final works. Reiss ended up designing nearly all of the terminal's artwork, including over of mosaic murals. ==Construction== Power house construction, 1932 Structural framing of the terminal's dome The Union Terminal Company was created on July 14, 1927 to build the terminal, railroad lines in and out, and other related transportation improvements. Construction began in 1928 with the regrading of the east flood plain of the Mill Creek to a point nearly level with the surrounding city, an effort that required of landfill. Elevation was a serious concern, as all older stations in Cincinnati had experienced regular flooding from the Ohio River. The new terminal's main level was to be built at 522 feet above sea level. The terminal company purchased a hill nearby, locally known as Bald Knob, for the landfill. Material at Bald Knob was discovered to be thin strata of fossil limestone, imbedded with clay and weak shale, which did not consolidate properly. This led the terminal company to abandon the site and to use material from a gravel pit in Miamitown. Other work included the construction of mail and express terminals, an engine terminal, power house, coach yard, viaducts over the Mill Creek, and the railroad approaches to Union Terminal. The new viaducts the Union Terminal Company created to cross the Mill Creek Valley included the Waldvogel Viaduct and the well-built . Out of all structures built for the complex, the Western Hills Viaduct was considered only second to the terminal building in its design. Construction on the terminal building itself began in August 1929, shortly before the Great Depression started. At the time, much of its site was used for yard tracks, a public dump, houses, grain silos, an ice warehouse, and a city park, Lincoln Park. The terminal company transformed the park, which had a sunken garden, lake and island, into the terminal's lush entrance drive. The Lincoln Park Grounds or Union Grounds was an adjacent baseball field, removed for installation of the terminal and plaza. The terminal company also bought multiple lots, many unoccupied, and altered or tore down many buildings in order to construct tracks, reportedly numbering 276. The project involved widening the streets around the station, in anticipation of increased traffic. Buildings were also demolished to widen the principal street, first known as Laurel Street, renamed Terminal Approach or Terminal Parkway in 1932, renamed Lincoln Park Drive by 1935, and given its current name, Ezzard Charles Drive, in 1976. Laurel Street Park was constructed along the street in 1931 in exchange for the loss of Lincoln Park. The park is now known simply as Laurel Park, potentially due to the street's name changing. The cornerstone was laid on November 20, 1931, with Cincinnati mayor Russell Wilson laying mortar for it with a silver trowel. Construction was finished six months ahead of schedule, in March 1933 instead of September. The final cost of the project was $41.5 million. The terminal was put into emergency operation on March 19, 1933, because of another Ohio River flood, which created the need for emergency supplies and workers, and forced the closure of four of the five existing Cincinnati stations. The five existing stations in Cincinnati were forced to close. The first train to utilize the station was Southern Railroad Engine 6455 on March 19, headed for Chattanooga, Tennessee. The official opening of the station was on March 31, 1933, and Mayor Wilson dedicated the building, opening the doors ceremoniously with a gold key presented by the Union Terminal Company president H. A. Worcester. It was estimated that 50,000 people attended the event, including the architects, former mayor Murray Seasongood, Governor George White, chief engineer Henry M. Waite, and terminal company vice president George Dent Crabbs. The event included a public viewing of the terminal, a concert, and other ceremonial events, and was followed with a large public banquet at the Netherland Plaza's Hall of Mirrors. At this event, B&O; director John J. Cornwell notably stated that passenger stations were declining in use, and that the building's completion came after its need had passed. The terminal's opening prompted the abandonment of Cincinnati's five older train stations; four of the seven railroads already had rerouted their track to Union Terminal. ==Operation and decline== Christmastime crowd, 1945 Union Terminal and its grounds in operation, 1947 Union Terminal opened during the Great Depression, a time of decline in train travel. Its early years therefore experienced relatively low passenger traffic. In 1937, another Ohio River flood affected the city for about a month, and river gauge levels peaked at , the highest level in the city's history. The terminal was built to withstand the flooding and was relatively undamaged. The lower levels of the building flooded, though passenger spaces, tracks, and platforms remained above the water level. The streets around it were flooded, including Hopkins and Kenner streets and Freeman Avenue. At the flood's peak, the Southern Railway was still operating out of the terminal, utilizing generators for lights and switches. Three railroads closed service to Cincinnati, though they still operated their suburban stations. The C&O;, L&N;, and the Norfolk & Western had to stop all trains. By 1939, local newspapers were already describing the station as a white elephant. It had a brief revival in the 1940s, because of World War II. During the war, the terminal acted as a regional center for the United Service Organizations (USO), providing recreational services to troops. Trains carrying soldiers would regularly stop at Union Terminal, and around August 1941, the Rookwood tea parlor began use as one of three USO centers in the terminal; it was used for reading books and magazines and writing letters. The terminal was planned to handle 17,000 passengers, though a world war was not envisioned. During the height of the war, the number of people traveling through the terminal averaged 34,000 per day. Passenger traffic declined through the 1950s into the 1960s, quickly shifting as air travel became more affordable and the Interstate Highway System was developing. Construction of Interstate 75 in the 1950s, directly in front of the Union Terminal grounds, cut off the terminal and its surroundings from downtown Cincinnati. Train service decreased from 51 per day in 1953 to 24 per day in 1962. Thus beginning in the late 1950s the Union Terminal Company searched for other uses for the building, including offering to lease space to the city for $1 per year. In June 1963, eight proposals for the space were made public: a railroad museum; transportation center for air, bus and rail lines; court building; convention center; Air Force museum; museum of science and industry; private industry; and a shopping center. In 1968, the Cincinnati Science Center opened in Union Terminal. The museum installed its exhibits on the south side of the train concourse, allowing the north side to be used for rail passengers. Due to financial difficulties, the museum closed in 1970. ==Abandonment and partial demolition== Arrivals chalkboard on October 28, 1972 Extensive restructuring took place in the railroad industry in the mid-to-late 20th century. Amtrak, the national rail service, was formed to acquire failing railroads as their ridership dropped. It took over most passenger service at Union Terminal in 1971, and cut back service to just two routes a day, both of which originated at the terminal‚Äìthe Washington/Newport News-bound George Washington and the Chicago-bound James Whitcomb Riley. Those trains were subsequently integrated into a single long-distance Chicago-Washington/Newport News train, known as the George Washington eastbound and the James Whitcomb Riley westbound. However, due to the two trains having been inherited from separate railroads‚Äìthe C&O; and Penn Central, respectively‚Äìthe merged train needed a half-hour delay to perform a slow turn on a balloon loop north of Union Terminal in order to face the train in the correct direction. The two total trains, with fewer than 30 boardings and detrainings per day, did not even begin to justify such a large station. As a result, Union Terminal was scheduled to close in October 1972, after 18 months of Amtrak service. It would be the first major station Amtrak abandoned in favor of a new station. The terminal's fate was uncertain after its scheduled closure, spurring multiple efforts to bring the topic to public attention in mid-to-late October. The Save and Revive Union Terminal Committee, department of art history at the University of Cincinnati (UC), and the Cincinnati Art Museum backed several projects. Northwestern professor Carl W. Condit lectured on the stations of Cincinnati at UC, and the train concourse's large industrial murals were illuminated for public viewing on October 22 to 29. An exhibit at the Contemporary Arts Center showed original photographs, drawings, and slides pertaining to the terminal's artworks, while an exhibit at UC's student center showed proposals for the terminal's future. By October 11, the Ohio Historical Society submitted a nomination for the terminal to the National Register of Historic Places. The society noted the emergency as its owner planned to demolish the terminal at the time, and noted that the building did not meet the 50-year standard for acceptance to the register. Nonetheless, the terminal was added to the National Register 20 days later. With Amtrak planning to abandon the station, the Union Terminal Company would be left owning an empty building, having no income, and significant debt. On October 26, it sold the train concourse, platforms, and rail yard to Southern Railway, which was expanding its freight operations. The railroad turned the passenger yard into a freight yard, and planned on removing the long passenger train concourse to allow for unimpeded use of double-height and piggyback train cars. The railway announced its plans and allowed interested parties time to remove the concourse's murals. On the same day as the sale, mayor Tom Luken announced a 23-person task force to preserve the terminal. The last passenger train to depart the terminal was an eastbound George Washington, which left for Washington/Newport News on October 28. Amtrak opened a smaller station at River Road, less than a mile from Union Terminal, on the following day. Of the replacement, it was said \\"you can put the new station in the men's room of the old station\\" (the current Amtrak waiting room). The terminal was seen as far too costly for Amtrak. Besides the limited service and patronage, it had enormous heating and maintenance costs, taxes, and $10 million in debentures due in 1974. The daily operating cost of River Road station was $500 to $1,000, while the terminal's daily cost was $2,000 to $3,000. The terminal was kept open to the public to attend showings at the Terminal Theater, which still held film classics during the period of closure. The train concourse during demolition Art historian Gabriel P. Weisberg largely attributes the work of University of Cincinnati graduate students in saving the terminal. Student reports, theses, newspaper editorials, and gallery exhibitions proved the significance of the terminal, at a time where many Cincinnati residents still viewed the building as a white elephant. In January 1973, the Revive Union Terminal Committee picketed a Southern Railway board member's house, the city commissioner refused to issue a wrecking permit for the terminal, and further public events were planned. At this time, the Contemporary Arts Center, Tangeman Art Gallery, and UC's Administration Building all were exhibiting art, architecture, artifacts, and works inspired by Union Terminal. An open house reopened the terminal for free public viewing on January 17. On May 15, 1973 the Cincinnati City Council's Urban Development and Planning Committee voted 3‚Äì1 in favor of designating Union Terminal for preservation as a local historic landmark, preventing Southern Railway from destroying the entire building. By September 1974, the Southern Railway tore down most of the train concourse. Before this, the city removed the fourteen Reiss mosaic murals depicting important Cincinnati industries; Besl Transfer Company transported and installed them at the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport. A grassroots campaign named \\"Save the Terminal\\" raised the $400,000 needed to save the works, though it could not raise sufficient funds to save the map mural at the west wall of the concourse, which was destroyed. ==Further plans and mall development== Loehmann's Department Store in the terminal's Rotunda Several plans were floated for reuse of the building in the 1970s, including a plan to locate a Southwest Ohio Regional Transit Authority transit hub and the School for Creative and Performing Arts in the building, but these did not materialize. In August 1975, the City of Cincinnati purchased the remaining terminal building and its 15-acre property from the Union Terminal Company for $1 million. Seeking tenants, they heard plans from three developers. The city government chose the Joseph Skilken Organization, a Columbus-based real estate developer. The company was run by Steve Skilken, its 27-year-old president. The Skilken Organization initially proposed \\"Oz\\" or the \\"Land of Oz\\", a shopping mall with an ice skating rink and bowling alley. The ice skating and bowling never materialized, but the shopping center's retail and restaurants began installation in 1978. The city offered a 30-year lease, at $1 per year. Skilken invested about $20 million in renovating the terminal, including repairing the fountains and clock, replacing windows, repainting the rotunda ceiling, professionally cleaning the interior murals, installing air conditioning, renovating the automobile ramps for pedestrian use, and resurfacing and adding additional parking lots, replacing park space. In 1977, the terminal was designated a U.S. National Historic Landmark. On August 4, 1980, the mall had its opening celebration, with 40 tenants. At its peak, the mall had 7,800 to 8,000 visitors per day and 54 vendors. The recession of the early 1980s negatively affected the mall; interest rates quickly grew from 6 to 22 percent. In 1981, the first tenant moved out and by 1982 the number of tenants had fallen to 21. In August of that year, the Cincinnati Museum of Health, Science and Industry opened in the terminal. Oz closed in 1984, however, Loehmann's Department Store, located in the center of the rotunda, remained open until 1985. For several years, a weekend flea market was held on the taxi and bus ramps that ran under the rotunda. ==Museum operation and rail service== Beginning in the early 1980s, the Cincinnati Historical Society and Cincinnati Museum of Natural History were searching for larger spaces. Both had their origins in the early-mid 1800s, and the historical society was interested in creating a museum. The most favorable options in their studies were to join together in occupying space in Union Terminal. In May 1986, the voters of the surrounding county approved $33 million in funding to transform the building into museum space. The state of Ohio provided $8 million, the city provided $3 million, while about 3,000 individuals, corporations, and foundations also donated to the effort. Talk show host and then-Cincinnati mayor Jerry Springer was one of the major proponents of saving the building and transforming it into a museum. The terminal's 200,000 square feet of underground space, then used as parking space, as well as its taxi and bus ramps, were renovated into exhibition space. The main concourse was restored, retail space was refurbished, and the theater was restored. The entrance to the train concourse was renovated into the Omnimax theater, and the men's lounge became Amtrak's waiting room and ticket counter. In 1986, the Union Terminal Association (UTA) was created to facilitate long-term preservation of the terminal. The organization included community members and city and county officials. The UTA leased the building from the city and searched for tenants. The UTA joined the Historical Society and Museum of Natural History in creating the Heritage Center at Union Terminal. The museum opened on November 10, 1990, though it had its \\"grand opening day\\" on November 2, 1991, with the two museum's first permanent exhibits there. The original members of the museum center were the Cincinnati Historical Society Library, Cincinnati History Museum, Cincinnati Museum of Natural History, and the Robert D. Lindner Family Omnimax Theater. The museum center opened with the largest display of robotic dinosaurs, the largest World War II commemorative exhibit, and one of fourteen Omnimax theaters in the United States. Museum center officials were unsure if people would travel to the new museums as predicted, though the center became the fourth-largest attraction in the area, behind the Cincinnati Reds, Kings Island, and the Cincinnati Zoo. The museum center renovations also allowed Amtrak to restore service to Union Terminal via the tri-weekly Cardinal train‚Äìsuccessor of the Riley and George Washington. Train service first returned to Union Terminal on July 29, 1991 with a Chicago-bound train. The renovations included the installation of the Grand E.M. Skinner Concert Organ. In 1995, the entities officially merged to create the Cincinnati Museum Center, also joined by the Cinergy Children's Museum in October 1998. In 2004, the county again approved an operating levy for the building's operating costs and capital repairs. The Cincinnati Museum Center developed a master plan for restoring the terminal in 2007. This included a pilot project, Project 1, which focused on the southwest wing of the building. The project included replacing exterior walls and windows, repairing the structure, a new HVAC system, and conserving and restoring interior designs, including four dining rooms. The southwest wing's roof was also replaced with a green roof. The project demonstrated the use of sustainable technologies in restoration of historic buildings, while abiding by its alteration restrictions as a National Historic Landmark. It revealed difficulties in assessing whether sustainable conservation methods were allowable, and prompted the museum center to explore renewable energy for the entire site, without impacting architectural, cultural, or historical elements. In 2009, county residents approved an extension of the 2004 levy for further repairs. The museum center hosted a workshop in 2011 to discuss and debate renovation issues, attended by people in sustainability, architecture, design, preservation, and other academic fields. In June 2014, the National Trust for Historic Preservation named Union Terminal as one of the 11 most endangered historic places in the country due to deterioration. ==Renovation and reopening== Deteriorating service hallways prior to the renovation Terminal renovation, 2017 From July 2016 until November 2018, the museum was shut down in order to complete a $228 million renovation throughout the entire building, in addition to restoring numerous rooms original to the building. The renovation was approved by Hamilton County voters through an increased sales tax, bringing $176 million, and was also funded by $5 million in state grants, $7.5 million in donations, and $39 million in federal historic tax credits. It was the first full renovation of the building, after two smaller renovations that made the Land of Oz shopping center and the Cincinnati Museum Center operable. Due to the building's flat roofs, water damage caused the walls and roofs to rot. Original plans called for leaving the Duke Energy Children's Museum and the Cincinnati History Museum open, but it was decided to shutter the entire building after water damage proved to be more extensive than previously thought. During the closure, items located in the museum were stored in the Geier Center, the museum's research and storage facility, and in various traveling exhibits across the country. Amtrak services moved to a temporary annex on Kenner Street, just north of Union Terminal. The renovation included cleaning and repairing the building. The clock face, hands, and mechanism were removed and repaired, and the mosaic murals and canvas paintings were cleaned. One of the most significant projects was the replacement of the building's westernmost wall, built after the concourse was demolished. The wall was not braced properly, was not built to expand or contract with weather conditions, and was failing. The wall, 20 feet above ground, and 40 feet tall and 100 feet wide, was difficult to replace, especially with the active freight line 15 feet behind it. Workers also dismantled the entire fountain and front plaza. The children's museum and mezzanine lie directly beneath the fountain, and the roof had experienced leaking. The waterproofing was as old as the terminal, and thus was replaced. The fountain was reinstalled with the same specifications, and a new concrete and terrazzo basin, and repolished brass fixtures. The plaza concrete was replaced, adding colored stripes as was original to the design. In July 2018, Amtrak de-staffed 15 of its stations, including Cincinnati. Two Union Terminal ticket agents were replaced by a part-time contracted caretaker, and Amtrak eliminated the ability to check baggage, purchase tickets in-person, and for unaccompanied minors to board or disembark in Cincinnati. Since the completion of the renovation project, the station remains without dedicated staff, and all tickets to and from Cincinnati must be purchased in advance; there are no Quik-Trak ticket kiosks. Baggage service is self-serve; passengers can check bags trainside after obtaining baggage checking supplies in the station and attaching them to their baggage. In May 2020, following a new law passed by Congress, Amtrak began the hiring process for new CUT station agents, along with those for other stations cut in 2018.https://trn.trains.com/news/news- wire/2020/05/22-amtrak-begins-hiring-process-to-restore-agents-at-15-stations The building and museum center had their reopening ceremony on November 17, 2018. The terminal expanded its foodservice contract from 2014 for operation of three dining rooms on the main concourse, two on the lower level, a retail shop, and other rotating operations. The main level operation Cup and Pint now serves pizzas, coffee, and draft beer, while Nourish 513 serves sandwiches, salads, and fast food. The Rookwood Tea Room reopened as a Graeter's location. In January 2019, the terminal gained another museum as a tenant, the Nancy & David Wolf Holocaust and Humanity Center, in the former space of the History Library. ==References* Cincinnati Museum Center Category:Cincinnati Union Terminal Category:History of Cincinnati ","title":"History of Cincinnati Union Terminal"},{"id":"61247755","text":"Kim So-hee (born 28 July 1992) is a South Korean taekwondo practitioner.

TRACERS will observe solar particles interacting with Earth's magnetic field at the northern magnetic cusp region. Here, the field lines guide particles from the boundary between Earth's magnetic field down into the atmosphere. In a process known as magnetic reconnection, the field lines violently reconfigure, sending particles out at speeds that can approach the speed of light. Some of these particles will be guided by the Earth's field into the region where TRACERS can observe them.¬∑NASA selects missions to observe the sun and its impact on Earth.

The Commission will produce a report to Parliament following the 2019 election with recommendations for organizing debates in future elections. ==Background== Prior to the creation of the commission, Canadian leaders' debates were organized and held by a consortium of the main television networks. In 2015, Stephen Harper, then leader of the Conservative Party, said he would not participate in debates organized by the consortium and instead participate in a series of independently organized debates. While he later agreed to participate in a French language debate hosted by the consortium, no English language debate was hosted by the consortium due to the resulting uncertainty. Other independently hosted debates occurred during the 2015 election campaign, but reached much smaller audiences than previous consortium debates. ==Mandate== The commission is tasked with holding two official debates during the 2019 federal election. Following the election, it is also required to provide a report to Parliament on the leaders' debates and make recommendations for how future leaders debates should be conducted. ==Composition== David Johnston, former Governor General of Canada, is the commissioner. Journalist Michel Cormier serves as the commissions' executive director. The body also has a seven person advisory board. The current members are of former Members of Parliament John Manley, Megan Leslie, and Deborah Grey, history professor Chad Gaffield, human rights activist Craig Kielburger, judge Louise Otis and Aboriginal Peoples Television Network CEO Jean LaRose. The first meeting of the advisory board took place on March 26, 2019. ==2019 Debates== The English language debate is took place on October 7 and the French on October 10. Both debates took place at the Canadian Museum of History in Gatineau, Quebec. ===Production=== Following the Commission's request for proposal, the Canadian Debate Production Partnership was selected to produce the debates. The CDPP consisted of a consortium of English- and French-language broadcasters and newspapers: CBC News/Radio-Canada, Global News, CTV News, the Toronto Star, HuffPost Canada/Quebec, La Presse, Le Devoir, and L'Actualit√©. The English debate was moderated by Rosemary Barton (CBC News), Susan Delacourt (Toronto Star), Dawna Friesen (Global News), Lisa LaFlamme (CTV News) and Althia Raj (HuffPost Canada), each responsible for a portion of the debate. The French moderator was Patrice Roy (Ici Radio-Canada T√©l√©), who was assisted by several journalists from prominent Quebec newspapers. ===Leaders invited=== The government established rules in 2018 to determine which party leaders are invited to the official debates. To be invited a party must satisfy two of the following: # Have at least one member elected under the party's banner; # Nominate candidates to run in at least 90% of all ridings; and # Have captured at least 4% of the votes in the previous election or be considered by the commissioner to have a legitimate chance to win seats in the current election, based on public opinion polls. In November 2018, Minister of Democratic Institutions Karina Gould said that Maxime Bernier would qualify for the debates as leader of the People's Party of Canada if the party nominated candidates in 90% of ridings. On August 12, 2019, the Commissioner extended invitations for Justin Trudeau, Andrew Scheer, Jagmeet Singh, Elizabeth May and Yves-Fran√ßois Blanchet to attend. He also sent a letter to Maxime Bernier indicating that he did not qualify for the debates at this time, and asking for additional information from the People's Party so that a final decision could be reached by September 16. Bernier criticized the decision saying that it would not be a \\"real debate\\" without him. On September 16, following submission of further information from the People's Party, the Commissioner determined that \\"more than one candidate endorsed by the party has a reasonable chance to be elected\\" and therefore Bernier would be invited to the debates. ===Content of debates=== English debate: 1\\\\. Affordability and economic insecurity 2\\\\. National and global leadership 3\\\\. Indigenous issues 4\\\\. Polarization human rights, and immigration 5\\\\. Environment and energy French debate: 1\\\\. The economy and finances 2\\\\. Environment and energy 3\\\\. Foreign policy and immigration 4\\\\. Ethics and governance 5\\\\. Service to citizens On July 17, protesters gathered in cities across Canada calling for a leaders' debate to be held on the topic of climate change. The protests were directed at CBC News after organizers were told that broadcasters not the commission would determine the questions and topics of the debates. In response to the protests, the CBC released a statement saying that the commission and the editorial group at the broadcaster ultimately selected to host the debates would be responsible for making such determinations. On August 8, 2019, organizers delivered a petition with 48,000 signatures to the CBC. == References == == External links == * Official Website * * Category:Canadian federal elections Category:Leaders' debates Category:Canadian federal departments and agencies Category:Bilingualism in Canada Category:Canadian mass media regulation Category:Election agencies in Canada ","title":"Leaders' Debates Commission"},{"id":"61247936","text":"Zhang Dinghuang (; 1895‚Äì1986), also known as Zhang Fengju () was born in Nanchang.

She developed models that take into account the structure and interfaces of the Earth, including effects of Earth tides and core resonances. This work led to a new and more accurate reference model for the Earth's rotation. Her research group was rewarded for this work with the 300,000 Euro Descartes Prize in 2003.http://europa.eu/rapid/press- release_IP-03-1575_en.pdf Dehant is a co-investigator on the NASA RISE (Rotation and Interior Structure Experiment) and SEIS (Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure) projects, which are being hosted by the InSight mission to Mars. The RISE team will use Doppler measurements to determine the rotation and position of Mars in space. This in turn provides information about the structure of the deep interior of Mars. Dehant's work has been widely recognized. In 2003 she received the European Geosciences Union geodesy prize, known as the Vening-Meinesz Medal. She is a Fellow of the American Geophysical Union and a foreign member of the French Academy of Sciences. In 2016 she received the Whitten medal from the American Geophysical Union. This award is given for \\"outstanding achievement in research on the form and dynamics of the Earth and planets\\". == Awards and honors== * 1988: Charles Lagrange Prize * 2003: Vening-Meinesz Medal, European Geosciences Union * 2003: Descartes Prize of the European Union * 2007: Fellow of the American Geophysical Union * 2014: Honorary Doctorate, Observatory of Paris * 2015: Foreign Member, French Academy of Sciences * 2016: Charles A.

Built after what was called \\"the golden era of highway construction\\" in the United States, its planning and actual construction fit into an ongoing pattern of local and state governments \\"building elevated expressways through black districts\\" in many major American cities even at the height of the civil rights movement. In Montgomery, it is estimated that around 75% of the people forced to vacate their homes for the construction were of African American descent, and while it was argued that running the expressway through some poorer areas would decrease urban blight, others criticized what they saw as a blatant attempt to destroy traditionally African American neighborhood and forced the inhabitants to move to other parts of town, further removed from the center. Critics argue also that this project, as did other such projects, effectively strengthened or reinstated racial segregation. == Placement of the highways Affected community=== The communities that existed prior to building I 85 were named Centennial Hill, Bel Air and The Bottoms. The houses in these communities were determined to be of very low value and each of the affected home owners, were given \\"$3,300\\" for their homes, which to them felt like a low amount. Eight days after the meeting George W. Curry, a black minister and head of a property owners' committee, gathered 1,150 signatures for a petition that was later sent in to the local, state, and federal highway officials. This was to show the number of people protesting against the amount of homes that were being destroyed, and provided an alternate route that would barely affect anyone's place of living and cost $30,000 less for the overall construction. He further went to claim that it was a way to force major African American leaders out of their homes and shut down 2 of the known African American churches that are in the area.. There were 164 houses listed in \\"fair\\" to good\\" condition that were homes to African American middle class. These residents were doctors, teachers, coaches, and lawyers. Martin Luther King Jr.'s and Ralph Abernathy's home and church were also going to be affected by this construction and Ralph wrote a telegram to President John F. Kennedy stating \\"If this route is approved, it will destroy one of the best negro neighborhoods in the south and make for a hazardous condition near the local negro college, a high school, and an elementary school. The destruction of this neighborhood will only aid the segregationist in their attempt to make the negro vote as ineffective as possible.\\" The placement also prevented students from attending their college classes due to no safe way to cross the highway in a timely manor. There were also other African American communities that were destroyed with the construction of 1-65 as well. Even today, the interstates separate the West side of the community and prevents the minority community from building closer inwards. Rosa Parks Museum director Daniel Niel stated commented on how the tourists for the number one city in hotel reservations in Alabama, doesn't have all the shops and restaurants to buy from anymore, that were in the path. Where the Montgomery Improvement Association founding location, the original Mount Zion African Methodist Episcopal Church in Montgomery, Alabama, Carlton McClendon Furniture Co. were both abandoned. Croskery's porch had housing across the street but now faces only the interstate. Glass street with wooden Shotgun housing, Chilton Street and Minto street were all destroyed to make room for the interstate As it was in many major cities in the U.S. at the time, most interstate construction was planned around going through the cheapest land available. Also, some plans had been laid out since 1939, based around the drivers for the most traveled areas. Construction didn't start until white flight had occurred, where a majority of this land was African American residences or businesses. These communities' not having a large effect on political planning of the routes made the plans even easier to follow through with. There were protests between Ann Street and the Interchange between the two interstates, but the Bus Boycott and Freedom Rides from the Civil Rights Movement were already occurring at the same time. The protests caused only minor delay due to Rex M. Whitton, Federal Highway Administrator, telling Samual Englehardt to \\"Let the dust settle for about six months and then proceed with construction of the project.. ==Affected citizens== After construction was completed, C. B. Croskery, a member of the clergy who had lived on Stone Street since 1955, said in an interview: \\"They sent out a letter saying they wanted to pave the highway and next thing I knew, they were out there digging up a whole line of houses on the other side of the street\\". Skip Jackson, a resident of Carlisle Street, recalled watching the start of construction when he was in Second Grade. \\"I can remember the day they brought the big earthmovers out there, We knew it was coming. When the people who owned their homes started to move, we knew that was coming. Just like any neighborhood that's poor, you don't argue. All it did for us was kill our neighborhood.\\" C. R. Williams said that he \\"was unaware of the state's planned route through his neighborhood.\\" He had been told a year earlier that the interstate would run north of Oak Park instead. == Original construction planning == According to the original plans the interstate was to travel through the downtown business district and have exits to several of the local industrial and business sites. I-65 is to pass through the city in a north to south direction and will start down in Mobile, Alabama at Interstate 10 and travel \\"northeasterly\\" via Evergreen and Greenville through Montgomery to Birmingham, Cullman, and Decatur into Tennessee and beyond. The north-south route planned will cross the southern bypass near the city sewerage treatment plant, then Fairview Avenue, at an interchange section east of the Barber Dairy plant, running parallel to Holt Street to its intersection with I-85 just southwest of the intersection of Holt and Day Streets. After crossing Bell Street the route crosses the railroad and the Alabama River and will have an interchange with the North Montgomery Belt route on the river peninsula before crossing Cobb's Ford Road west of the junction with Millbrook Road and crossing county line from Montgomery County into Autauga County. This section alone is estimated to cost around $17 million. I-85 is to start at an intersection of I-65, and continue from there to Auburn, Opelika, and Lanettand then to Atlanta and other eastern locations. Starting at the Day and Holt Street intersection with Interstate 65 and continuing eastward through the city, it is to run mostly parallel to Donaldson Street, crossing Virginia Avenue and following a line almost parallel to and just south of U.S. Highway 80. == Newspaper coverage == Karl Portera at The Montgomery Advertiser labeled building the two interstates as having the potential to make the Montgomery area a \\"major metropolitan center of south-central Alabama\\". Sam Engelardt stated \\"not only serve the communities traffic needs, but is a very important factor in shaping future municipal and economic growth in urban areas.\\" Construction had already started in rural Alabama for both routes, some already have pedestrians driving on the finished, but not connected roads. The finished interstates are expected to bring an estimated 50,000 vehicles or higher by 1975 daily. Bringing them directly through the center of the downtown business district and have access to several local industrial and business sites. == References == Category:Civil rights movement Category:Montgomery, Alabama Category:Interstate 65 Category:Interstate 85 ","title":"Interstate construction during the Civil Rights Movement in Montgomery, Alabama"},{"id":"61248110","text":"You're Not a Monster is an adult animated series created by Frank Lesser, and voiced by Kelsey Grammer, Eric Stonestreet, Patton Oswalt, Ellie Kemper and Aparna Nancherla.

CISCO Security Research & Operations- 3 June 2015:Understanding Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding  Cisco -unicast-reverse-path-forwarding In computer networking, there are several multicast group communication protocols where data transmission is addressed to a group of destination computers simultaneously. (Multicast Source Discovery Protocol, Multicast BGP, Protocol Independent Multicast) == Overview == Multicast routing is a method of transmitting to all subscribers registered in a group by one transmission unlike unicast routing (i.e. OSPF, RIP) which transmits 1: 1 necessary data. CISCO Security Research & Operations- 3 June 2015:IP Multicast Routing Technology Overview  Cisco IP Multicast Routing Technology Overview To implement the multicast routing, IGMP protocol and multicast routing protocol(Reverse-path forwarding, PIM-SM) for registration subscriber grouping and control traffic are required for multicast transmission. Multicast IP Routing Technology Overview- 3 Nov 2018: IP Multicast Routing Technology Overview  Multicast IP Routing Technology Overview -comparitech Regarding IP multicast, it is a technique for one-to-many communication over an IP network. IP multicast covers some part of common multicast routing protocol. IP multicast also describe IP multicast software (i.e. VideoLAN, ‚Äî PIM module for the Quagga Routing Suite, UFTP, etc.). The multicast routing is specific and broad range of protocols for layer-3 routing protocol for multicast feature and it is defined on overview of the Internet Multicast Routing Architecture RFC5110.https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5110 == Routing mechanism == A multicast routing protocol is a mechanism for constructing a loop-free shortest path from a source host that sends data to the multiple destinations that receives the data. IPV4 uses Class D address (224.0.0.0 ~ 239.255.255.255) IPv6 multicast provides the previous feature of IPV4 and a new IPv6 feature, allowing a host to send a single data stream to a subset of all hosts (group transmission) concurrently.https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios- xml/ios/ipv6/configuration/15-2mt/ipv6-15-2mt-book/ip6-multicast.html There are four types of Well-Known IPv6 Multicast address range : ff02::1: All IPv6 devices,‚Ä¢ff02::2: All IPv6 routers,‚Ä¢ff02::5: All OSPFv3 routers,‚Ä¢ff02::a: All EIGRP (IPv6) routers. http://www.ciscopress.com/articles/article.asp?p=2803866&seqNum;=5 == The Multicast tree classification == There are two types of Multicast trees which are the Source based tree and Group Shared tree. Microsoft Multicast Routing Protocol Overview- 3 June 2015:Microsoft Multicast Routing Protocol Overview  Microsoft Multicast Routing ProtocolOverview === Source based tree(SBT) === Its SSM (Source Specific Multicast) protocol. The maximum delay is short between End-to-end communication. It has poor scalability. (it is difficult to apply large network) Supported protocols include DVMRP, MOSPF, PIM-DM === Group Shared tree === It is Core-Based Tree, selecting one router in the network as the root and transmitting information through the root router. Maximum delay in the tree is longer than SBT(Source-based tree), The core router manages all the information, and the remaining routers manage the direction of the core and the multicast information requested by the current neighboring router. it has a Good Scalability (applicable to large networks).

There are others which are considered historical by the Sulphur Springs Valley Historical Society. Also included is the Chiricahua National Monument Historic Designed Landscape and images of the historic City Cemetery where Warren Earp. the younger brother of Wyatt Earp is buried. ==Brief history== The Native- Americans inhabited the area where the town of Willcox and its surrounding areas are located before the arrival of the people of European ancestry from the East Coast of the United States. The principal Native-American tribe which inhabited southeastern Arizona were the Chiricahua Apaches. They called themselves the Chiricahua Apache (Apache: great mountain) after their former mountain home in southeast Arizona. Their own name true name is actually the Aiaha.Chiricahua Apache TribeNATIVE AMERICAN/APACHES HISTORYHISTORY OF WILLCOX, ARIZONA, AND ENVIRONS ==Apache Wars== Compared to the other tribes in Arizona, the Chiricahua tribe were the most warlike. Among their leaders were Cochise, Victorio, Loco, Chato, Naiche, and Geronimo. The Chiricahua were involved in the so-called ‚ÄúIndian Wars‚Äù now referred to as the Apache Wars of the 1860s and 1870s. Some historians believe a misunderstanding during the ‚ÄúBascom Affair‚Äù launched clashes with the Chiricahua. Cochise was the Apache chief during the Apache Wars, he led an uprising against the U.S. government which began in 1861, and persisted until a peace treaty in 1872.Orlando Bolivar Willcox In 1872, President Ulysses S. Grant sent General Oliver Howard, as a special commissioner, to Arizona. Howard together with Tom Jeffords, a trusted friend of Cochise, met with the Chiricahua Chief. Their meeting concluded in an agreement to cease hostilities with the understanding that Cochise would use his influence with the other Chiricahua Apaches to this end. By the autumn of this year more than 1,000 of the tribe were settled on the newly established Chiricahua Reservation, southeast Arizona. Cochise died in 1874. Cochise County was named after the Chiricahua Apache Chief and the land where he is buried is now the Chiricahua National Monument. In 1878, General Orlando Bolivar Willcox assumed command of the Department of Arizona during the last years of the Apache Wars. ==Willcox is established== General Orlando Bolivar WillcoxWarren Baxter EarpWilliam \\"Bill\\" Downing In 1880, the small town of \\"Maley\\" was founded as a whistlestop for the Southern Pacific Railroad. A whislestop is a train station where a train will stop only on request; that is, only if there are passengers or freight to be picked up or dropped off.Whistle-stop The station was an important supply point for the Army during the Apache Wars from 1880 to 1886. It was also important to the cattle ranching and mining industries of southeastern Arizona as a major shipping point. General Willcox remained in his post until 1882. The citizens of the town of Maley renamed the town in his honor, however, his surname was misspelled and instead of being spelled with two \\"L\\"s it was spelled with one, hence \\"Wilcox\\". In 1889, the correction of the town's name was made and therefore \\"Wilcox\\" finally became \\"Willcox\\". In the early years, Willcox was a town with many saloons and hotels. There were shootings practically every week in Willcox and its surrounding area. Two of the more notable shootings involved Warren Earp in 1900 and Bill Downing in 1908.young.html Warren Earp -- A Young Bully Died YoungDowning tops Willcox bad man list Warren Baxter Earp, the youngest of the Earp brothers, was ill-tempered. He wasn't in town during the OK Corral gunfight, but he did participate in Wyatt Earp's revenge where many cowboys were murdered. Earp lived in Willcox. He disliked a fellow ranch cowboy named Johnny Boyett. He habitually bullied Boyett for months past. Earp and Boyett ran into each other in the \\"Headquarters Saloon\\" and Earp challenged Boyett to fight to the death. Boyett got a gun from the Willcox Hotel, and charged after Earp. After missing a few times, Earp was mortally wounded. Bill Downing was a member of the Burt Alvord gang. The gang was caught and arrested in Pearce after robbing the Cochise Train Depot. They were held in the prison of Tombstone. Members of the gang that were not arrested went to Tombstone and rescued the gang members in jail, but left Downing in jail because they disliked him. After spending seven years in the Yuma prison, Downing went to Willcox and opened the Free and Easy Saloon. He hired prostitutes who picked pocketed the customers. The town Sheriff and his Deputy went to the bar to serve Downing a warrant for his arrest. Downing dashed out a back door, but found himself face to face with the Deputy who had a shotgun. Downing reached for his gun and the Deputy shot him dead. What Downing didn't know is that he didn't have his gun because one the prostitutes stole it before he went out. The town celebrated when they learned of his death. Both Earp and Downing were buried in the historic \\"Old City Cemetery\\" of Willcox.Eagle Scout Project of Willcox Historical Cemetery The Pioneers' Cemetery Association (PCA) defines an \\"historic cemetery\\" as one which has been in existence for more than fifty years.Known Burial Sites in Arizona ==Sulphur Springs Valley Historical Society== The mission of the Sulphur Springs Valley Historical Society is to preserved and displayed historical items related to the cultural history of Willcox and its surrounding area.Sulphur Springs Valley Historical Society The historic building known as \\"The Toggery\\", is an extension of the Chiricahua Regional Museum and contains the research library and museum archives.

The monument was established on April 18, 1924, to protect its extensive hoodoos and balancing rocks. The Stafford Cabin in the Faraway Ranch is one of the first homestead dwellings in the Chiricahua Mountains vicinity. The cabin, built in 1880, is also among the oldest surviving log cabins in the region. Ja Hu Stafford was a pioneer settler who was born in Davidson County, North Carolina, to John Wesley and Clementine Reid Stafford. Stafford found the Chiricahua Mountain area to his liking and built a log cabin which was a small 14 square foot structure made with unpeeled logs, suggesting that it was built in a hurry. A second log room about the same size as the first was added sometime before 1885, followed by a small wooden-frame addition on the backside of the house around 1898. He dug an irrigation system which provided water for his fruit orchard.Library of Congress Ja Hu received his homestead certificate on April 6, 1886. He lived there with his wife Pauline and their six children for twenty years. In 1919 the cabin was remodeled and served as a guest cabin for the Faraway Ranch.

The property had been owned by Ameristar Casinos, Inc. until the company was acquired by Pinnacle Entertainment in 2013. However, Pinnacle was acquired by Pennsylvania-based Penn National Gaming in 2018. It is the only casino in Council Bluffs out of the three that is still on a riverboat.

He was returned to the US, stood trial, and convicted in 2017. He was charged with material support of terrorism for a planning role in a 2009 attack on Forward Operating Base Chapman in Khost. Al-Farekh's fingerprints were among those found on packing tape used in the vehicle-born improvised explosive devices used in the attack. Zarein Ahmedzay, convicted in 2010, testified he had helped train Al- Farekh. Although he was born in Texas he spent most of his childhood in Dubai. He is reported to have been radicalized by recordings of Anwar al-Awlaki's sermons, while attending University in Manitoba, Canada. Al Farekh moved to Winnipeg, in 2003, to live with his grandmother and uncle, to prepare to attend the University of Manitoba. After his radicalization he made his way to Pakistan with friends Ferid Imam and Maiwand Yar. Al Farekh is reported to have married the daughter of an al Qaeda leader. The Counter-terrorism project reported he worked under an al Qaeda leader named Abdul Hafeez, until his death, when he was promoted to a leadership role, himself.
