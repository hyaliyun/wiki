Murialdo's call to the priesthood did not manifest until late in his education in Savona; he pursued his ecclesial studies and was ordained as such in 1851 before dedicating himself to social work alongside the poor and with adolescent men. This put him into contact with social luminaries such as Giovanni Bosco and Giuseppe Cafasso who held Murialdo in great esteem. His zeal for social concern saw his frequent calls for an end to worker exploitation and the granting of further rights to workers in factories. Murialdo died in the odor of holiness in 1900 and had a reputation for deep personal holiness. This became more prevalent in northern Italian cities where Murialdo and his religious order worked. The cause for his canonization opened under Pope Benedict XV in 1921 with Pope John XXIII later confirming his heroic virtue and naming Murialdo as Venerable in 1961. Pope Paul VI beatified Murialdo in late 1963 and later canonized him just under a decade later in 1970. ==Life== Education Leonardo Murialdo was born on 26 October 1828 in Turin as the seventh of nine children to the upper middle-class Leonardo Franchino Murialdo (1776 or 1777-15.06.1833) and Teresa Rho (c. 1795-9.07.1849). His father - a stockbroker - died in 1833 during his childhood. His nickname as a child was \\"Nadino\\". Before him six sisters were born and after him, his brother and sister; his siblings were (in order): Elder - * Olimpia * Aurelia * Dionisia * Emilia * Clementine (died in her childhood) * Domitillia Younger - *Ernesto * Delfina (1830-???) Murialdo received his baptism on 27 October in the San Dalmazzo parish church. In 1836 both he and his brother Ernesto were sent to the Piarist boarding school (Scolopian College) in Savona which he attended until 1843; the pair arrived via coach on 27 October in the evening after having departed Turin on 25 October. His initial education there lasted until 1838 while he began his high school education there from 1838 until 1843. He studied the humanities and grammar and two of his educators were the priests Atanasio Canata and Giovanni Solari. But he felt a deep personal crisis from 1842-43 due to his fellow pupils' poor behaviour and tendencies. He and his brother returned to Turin in September 1843 where he made his first Confession to the abbot Pullini. On 3 November 1843 he returned to Savona to begin a philosophical course but also chose ancient historical sciences to avoid bad companions that had forced his earlier departure from the school. In spring 1844 he listened to the Capuchin friar Vincenzo Oliva give a Lenten sermon about Hell which had a profound impact on Murialdo to the point where he decided to consecrate himself to God. He decided he wanted to become a Capuchin in the spirit of detachment though the canon Lorenzo Renaldi - a close friend - dissuaded Murialdo and suggested he just become a diocesan priest instead. Murialdo's confessor during his time in Savona was Marcantonio Durando; Durando would be the one leading him in a spiritual retreat in preparation for his ordination. He completed his philosophical course (which he commenced in 1843) on 6 November 1845 and was then vested in the cassock for the first time after the abbot Pullini blessed the cassock in the Santa Chiara church once Murialdo began his ecclesial studies. Murialdo later wrote that \\"he never had a thought\\" about becoming a priest. Upon his return to Turin he began his ecclesial studies in 1845 at the college (as an external cleric student) there. He never believed he would become a priest and it was believed that his brother Ernesto would do so. In his childhood he wanted to pursue a career in the armed forces while in Savona entertaining notions of learning civil law. During his philosophical course he set himself on becoming an engineer. He began a theological course in Turin from 1845 to 1850 as an external clerical student and his two tutors during this time were the theologians Augusto Berta and Pietro Baricco. His academic course ended on 8 May 1850 and he received excellent results. Priesthood He received his ordination to the priesthood on 20 September 1851 in the Church of the Visitation from Monsignor Giovanni Domenico Ceretti; the latter also made Murialdo a subdeacon (21 September 1850) and a deacon (5 April 1851). He celebrated his first Mass at San Dalmazzo church with abbot Maximo Pullini and canon Lorenzo Renaldi co-celebrating alongside him. Murialdo's first focus after his ordination was to work in the poor Vanchiglia neighbourhood close to the Oratorio dell'Angelo Custode which his cousin Roberto Murialdo managed. It was one of the first oratories in Turin to minister to poor and abandoned children on the fringes of living. From 1857 until 1865 he was - at the request of John Bosco, the director for the Oratorio di San Luigi. Murialdo conferred and collaborated with Don Bosco as well as Joseph Cafasso. On 28 September 1865 he left Turin and went to the Saint-Sulpice church in Paris to further his theological studies in moral matters and to further himself in canon law. It was during this time that he attended a conference of the Vincentians and later visited London. In Paris he wanted to become a Sulpician but the superior Henri Icard dissuaded him from this. Murialdo returned to Turin in October 1866 and was put in charge of the Artigianelli Boarding School where adolescent men were educated and taught a trade. In 1870 he became the director of the Oratorio di San Martino. In 1871 he organized the Union of Catholic Workers on behalf of the women and other people who worked in factories. In 1871 he also was among the promoters of the popular Catholic libraries. In 1858 he met Pope Pius IX in a private audience after Bosco wanted Murialdo to go with him to meet the pontiff. In 1873 he established the Congregation of Saint Joseph in honor of Saint Joseph as a model for laborers and did this with Eugenio Reffo as his collaborator in this venture. He conferred with Father Icard and the theologian William Blengio to discuss hie dream while also conferring with the Bishop of Alba Eugenio Roberto Galletti and the Archbishop of Turin Alessandro Riccardi di Netro as well as his successor Lorenzo Gastaldi. The aim was to support apprentices and people in trades. He further founded an agricultural school in addition to a center for delinquents. In 1876 he founded the Association of the Good Press in 1876 to improve Italian journalism while - alongside Pio Paolo Perazzo - founded the newspaper The Voice of the Worker which became the diocesan paper known as The Voice of the People. Murialdo contracted a grave illness in 1877 but his friend Don Bosco said that he would live for much longer and would not die from his illness. In 1878 he founded an agricultural centre in Rivoli and later in 1892 - in the spirit of Pope Leo XIII's Rerum Novarum - wrote to the local council to denounce the exploitation of workers. He also presented a reform project including schooling until age fourteen and the abolition of night work. His last surviving siblings Aurelia and Ernesto both died in 1890 causing Murialdo great grief since all his friends and relatives were deceased at this stage. Declining health and death In 1885 he suffered serious bronchitis that lasted from 1 January until 17 February; Murialdo believed he would die during this time due to the seriousness of his illness. Don Bosco visited him and blessed him. Murialdo died on 30 March 1900 in Turin due to pneumonia; his final words were: \\"I'm waiting\\". His remains were interred after his funeral but later transferred to the Santa Barbara church in Turin. ==Sainthood== The formal cause of canonization started under Pope Benedict XV on 23 November 1921 and conferred on him the title of Servant of God. The diocesan process for investigating Murialdo's life and reputation for holiness took place in Turin from 1910 until 1913 with his writings receiving theological approval on 13 December 1916; the Congregation for Rites validated this diocesan investigation on 2 March 1932. The work culminated in the declaration of his life of heroic virtue on 26 April 1961 when Pope John XXIII proclaimed him to be Venerable. Pope Paul VI beatified him on 3 November 1963 and later canonized him less than a decade later in 1970. General Audience On 28 April 2010 - during his General Audience - Pope Benedict XVI spoke about Murialdo on the occasion of the Year of Priests that the pontiff had convoked. He referred to Murialdo's \\"loving response to God\\" in doing His will as well as \\"his conviction of the merciful love of God\\". The pope continued that Murialdo possessed a keen and \\"serene awareness of his own limitations\\" from his own education to his priesthood and during his social apostolate which the pope referred to as \\"the tireless zeal of action\\". Benedict XVI concluded that Murialdo \\"abandoned himself with trust to Providence\\" which motivated his life and had a profound influence on his social apostolate in Turin. ==Namesakes== Murialdo has become the focus for several locations and organizations such as: * The San Leonardo Murialdo parish located in Milan.Parish of San Leonardo Murialdo, Milan * The Instituto Leonardo Murialdo located in Albano Lazio; the Murialdines manage it to provide an education to children.Instituto Leonardo Murialdo, Albano Lazio * The Oratorio di San Leonardo Murialdo in Popesti Leordeni for adolescents.\\"Ce este Oratoriul?\\", Fundatia Murialdo * The San Leonardo Murialdo church on Via Salvatore Pincerle 144 in Rome was built in 1978 and consecrated a decade later in 1988. ==References * Hagiography Circle * Saints SQPN * Salesians of Don Bosco * Find a Grave * Murialdo official website Category:1828 births Category:1900 deaths Category:Canonizations by Pope Paul VI Category:19th-century Christian saints Category:19th-century Italian people Category:19th-century Roman Catholic priests Category:19th-century venerated Christians Category:20th-century Christian saints Category:20th-century Italian people Category:20th-century Italian Roman Catholic priests Category:20th-century venerated Christians Category:Beatifications by Pope Paul VI Category:Deaths from pneumonia Category:Founders of Catholic religious communities Category:Incorrupt saints Category:Italian activists Category:Italian Roman Catholic saints Category:People from Turin Category:Roman Catholic activists Category:Social reformers Category:Venerated Catholics ","title":"Leonardo Murialdo"},{"id":"46371442","text":"Philonome curvilineata is a species of moth of the family Tineidae.

Eventually Willie won by two strokes from Morris, spoiling Morris's attempt at a third consecutive win, which would have given him outright possession of the Challenge Belt which had been donated by Archibald Montgomerie, the Earl of Eglinton, although Morris took the second prize of £5. ==Death and legacy== Brown died in 1902 in London, England.

The experience led Loven to quit his job and venture into jazz studies. He initially contacted Gustavsen via the yellow pages, and succeeded in receiving some piano lessons. Later, Loven moved to South Africa to study jazz at the South African College of Music under professor Andrew Liley. Since 2011 he has made several public performances in South Africa and Europe, including recent concerts at the Oslo Jazz Festival, Canal Street Jazz Festival and the Norwegian National Jazz Scene. In January 2015, Andreas released his debut album, Nangijala (Losen records), to critical acclaim. The album consisted of both duos and trios with South African sax-legend and close friend, Buddy Wells and Spha Mdlalose on vocals. In February 2016 Andreas Loven released his second album, District Six recorded with his South African quartet, including South African sidemen Buddy Wells (sax), Clement Benny (drums) and Romy Brauteseth (bass). The album, rooted in both South African jazz traditions and Nordic folk, received notable attention worldwide after its release, receiving positive reviews from Gwen Ansell in South Africa, Peter Bacon in UK, Adam Baruch in Israel, Jan Granlie in Norway and others. ==Discography== *2015: Nangijala (Losen Records) *2016: District Six (Losen Records) ==References * *Andreas Loven Trio @ Caféteateret, 16. januar 2013 on YouTube *Andreas Loven - Nangijala on Vimeo Category:Norwegian composers Category:Norwegian male composers Category:Norwegian pianists Category:Losen Records artists Category:Musicians from Tromsø Category:Musicians from Oslo Category:1981 births Category:Living people Category:Norwegian male pianists Category:21st-century pianists Category:21st-century Norwegian male musicians ","title":"Andreas Loven"},{"id":"46371645","text":"Philonome rivifera is a species of moth of the family Tineidae.

The regular season started in July 2014 and finished on 14 June 2015, followed by relegation and promotion play-offs. The Oberliga is organised in fourteen regional divisions with the league champions promoted to the level above, the Regionalligas while the relegated teams drop down to the Verbandsligas and Landesligas. ==Overview== The fourteen Oberligas in Germany in 2014–15 In the 2014–15 season 243 clubs compete in the Oberligas, two less than in the previous season. Of the fourteen league champions twelve were promoted to the Regionalliga while one, the Oberliga Hamburg champions TuS Dassendorf, declined promotion for the second year running. No club from the Oberliga Hamburg was promoted to the Regionalliga as the only club to apply for a licence, SC Victoria Hamburg, later withdrew for financial reasons after successfully passing the application process. One league champion, Bremer SV of the Bremen-Liga, missed out on promotion in the play-off round, as they had done in 2013–14. Apart from twelve of the fourteen Oberliga champions six runners-up also achieved promotion. Three of them, Bahlinger SC, FC Amberg and VfV 06 Hildesheim, had to go through the promotion round. The other three, Rot Weiss Ahlen, FC Oberlausitz and FC Schönberg 95, were directly promoted. The two NOFV- Oberligas each had two teams directly promoted to the Regionalliga Nordost as the league was to be expanded from 16 to 18 clubs.NOFV informiert zu Auf- und Abstieg fupa.net, published: 20 May 2015, accessed: 24 May 2015 Additionally, because 1. FC Magdeburg won promotion to the 3. Liga, a playoff between the two third-placed clubs in the NOFV-Oberligas determined a fifth team, the FSV 63 Luckenwalde, to move up.Aufstiegsspiele RL Nordost nofv-online.de, accessed: 9 June 2015 The most successful goal scorer of the fourteen Oberligas was Sebastian Kinzel with 51 goals to his name. The Oberligas also saw an exodus of reserve teams with seven clubs withdrawing their second team, those being VfR Aalen II, SV Wehen II, Erzgebirge Aue II, Chemnitzer FC II, Dynamo Dresden II, 1. FC Saarbrücken II and SpVgg Unterhaching II. The last two of those finished the season on relegation ranks and would have been relegated regardless. Apart from these seven teams another three non-reserve sides resigned from the Oberligas while 38 clubs were relegated. The only team to complete the 2014–15 Oberliga season undefeated was Bremer SV, with a record of 25 wins, five draws and no defeat. The club scored 118 goals during the season, second only to Brinkumer SV with 119. At the other end 1. FC Schwalmstadt was the worst Oberliga club with a record of one win, three draws and 26 defeats, accumulating just six points during the season.

Ferneley, . James Ogilvie Fairlie (10 October 1809 – 5 December 1870) was a Scottish amateur golfer and landowner. Fairlie placed eighth in the 1861 Open Championship. He was a mentor to Old Tom Morris who named his son, James Ogilvie Fairlie Morris, after him. Fairlie was a founding member of Prestwick Golf Club in 1851. Playing on the Old Course at St. Andrews, Fairlie won the Silver Cross Medal in 1849, 1854, and 1860. He won the Gold Medal (King's Medal) in 1857 and 1862. Fairlie served as the captain of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St. Andrews and was the principal organiser of the first Open Championship held at Prestwick in 1860. Fairlie was a friend and frequent playing partner of the Earl of Eglinton, Archibald Montgomerie, who donated the \\"Challenge Belt\\" that was awarded to the Open Championship winner. ==Early life== Fairlie (left) with Old Tom Morris, Fairlie was born in Calcutta, West Bengal, India, on 10 October 1809. He was the son of William Fairlie and Margaret Fairlie (née Ogilvie) of Coodham, Symington, Ayrshire. He took to the links as a youngster and quickly became an accomplished golfer. His father was a partner in the banking firm of Fairlie, Bonner & Co. which was subsequently renamed Hartwell, Innes, Clerk, Brazier & Co. In William Fairlie's last will and testament dated 9 October 1823, he bequeathed to his son the sum of £19,000 which was his share of the residuary estate, money that would not be his to spend until reaching the age of 25. In later life, as a result of his great wealth and social status, his name was often printed with the suffix \\"Esquire\\". Fairlie enjoyed participating in steeplechase and maintained a stable with several horses. At age 30 he was a participant in the Eglinton Tournament of 1839 which was a re-enactment of a medieval joust and revel held in Scotland between 28 and 30 August. It was funded and organised by Archibald, Earl of Eglinton, and took place at Eglinton Castle in Ayrshire. He was educated at Charterhouse, Harrow, and St John's College, Cambridge.https://medium.com/@stjohnscamalumni/the-johnian-who-founded-the- open-592cd1b03252. Retrieved 22 July 2019. ==Golf career== Open Championship organiser Fairlie was the principal organiser of the first Open Championship held at Prestwick in 1860. With the untimely death of Allan Robertson, aged 42 in 1859, Prestwick members decided to conduct a challenge the following year that would determine the land's greatest golfer. In a proposed competition for a \\"challenge belt\\", Fairlie sent out a series of invitations to Aberdeen, Blackheath, Bruntsfield, Carnoustie Panmure, Dirleton Castle North, Leven, Montrose, Musselburgh, North Berwick, Perth and St Andrews. These clubs were invited to send \\"their two best professional players\\", who were to be \\"known and respectable caddies\\" to play in a tournament to be held on 17 October 1860. 1861 Open Championship After first organising the inaugural 1860 Open Championship, Fairlie became an entrant to actually play in the second Open Championship in 1861. The tournament was held at Prestwick Golf Club, Ayrshire, Scotland. It was the first that allowed amateurs, as well as professionals, to enter. Ten professionals and eight amateurs contested the event, with Tom Morris, Sr. winning the championship by 4 shots from Willie Park, Sr. Fairlie's total was 184, giving him an eighth-place finish in the tournament. He won no prize money due to his amateur status. Competitions at St. Andrews Playing on the Old Course at St. Andrews, Fairlie won the Silver Cross Medal in 1849, 1854, and 1860. He won the Gold Medal (King's Medal) in 1857 and 1862. The two medals have been competed for since 1836 and 1837, respectively. While at St. Andrews, the illustrator and painter Thomas Hodge produced a pen and monochrome watercolour depicting Fairlie on the links in the 1860s. The painting sold on 8 July 1999 at a Christie's auction in London, South Kensington, fetching £8,050. ==Military service== Fairlie served in the British military, achieving the rank of colonel. He sometimes played golf with his friend and fellow veteran Vice Admiral William H. Heriot-Maitland-Dougall. ==Death and legacy== Fairlie died on 5 December 1870 and is buried in the churchyard of Symington Parish Church, Symington, South Ayrshire, Scotland. He is best remembered as the principal organiser of the inaugural 1860 Open Championship. ==References== Category:Scottish male golfers Category:Amateur golfers Category:Golf administrators Category:People educated at Charterhouse School Category:People educated at Harrow School Category:Alumni of St John's College, Cambridge Category:People from Ayrshire Category:1809 births Category:1870 deaths ","title":"James Ogilvie Fairlie"},{"id":"46371736","text":"DK1 can refer to: *DK1 rigs, Vietnamese service stations in South China Sea *Resurs-DK No.1, Earth observation satellite *National road 1 (Poland) (Droga krajowa nr 1 in Polish) *, earliest train design in the Beijing Subway rolling stock *DK1, development kit for the head-mounted virtual reality display Oculus Rift ","title":"DK1"},{"id":"46371741","text":"The Commissioner's Office is a rare surviving example of transitional Spanish- Japanese architecture on the island of Rota in the Northern Mariana Islands, an insular area of the United States in the western Pacific Ocean.

At the time of the building's listing on the National Register of Historic Places in 1981, it was in deteriorated condition, lacking a roof and with one collapsed wall.

A poem on St. Andrews Links was the joint work of Chambers and his father. In 1874, on the resignation of James Payn, he became editor of Chambers's Journal; he occasionally contributed papers, and he conducted the magazine with great success. On the death of his uncle William in 1883, the whole responsibility of the publishing house devolved upon him, but he was assisted during the last two or three years of his life by his eldest son, Charles Chambers. He took an active part in the production of the first edition of Chambers's Encyclopædia (1859–68), and helped in the preliminary work in connection with the new edition. He also assisted Alexander Ireland, in the preparation of the 1884 edition of his father's Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation, in which was given the first authoritative information of the authorship. ==Golf career== 1861 Open Championship Chambers placed 10th in the 1861 Open Championship, held at Prestwick Golf Club, Ayrshire, Scotland.

All 55 seats in the City Council were up for election. The election was held simultaneously with regional elections in thirteen autonomous communities and local elections all throughout Spain, as well as the 1987 European Parliament election. The Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) won the election, but lost its absolute majority and lost 137,000 votes compared to 1983. The People's Alliance (AP), which stood separately after the breakup of the People's Coalition in 1986, failed to meet the level of support reached by the coalition in 1983 and also lost votes and seats. Benefitting from both parties' losses was the Democratic and Social Centre (CDS), which, with its 8 seats and 15% of the votes, entered the City Council for its first and only time and went on to hold the balance of power. United Left (IU), an electoral coalition comprising the Communist Party of Spain and other left-wing parties, continued on its long-term decline and lost 1 more seat, barely obtaining 100,000 votes and 6% of the share. AP and CDS together reached an absolute majority, but failure on reaching an agreement resulted in Socialist Juan Barranco being re-elected as mayor. However, on June 1989, both parties agreed to present a motion of censure on Barranco and elect Agustín Rodríguez Sahagún from the CDS as new mayor, ousting the PSOE from power in the city after a 10-year rule. ==Electoral system== The City Council of Madrid () was the top-tier administrative and governing body of the municipality of Madrid, composed of the mayor, the government council and the elected plenary assembly. Voting for the local assembly was on the basis of universal suffrage, which comprised all nationals over eighteen, registered in the municipality of Madrid and in full enjoyment of their political rights, as well as resident non-nationals whose country of origin allowed Spanish nationals to vote in their own elections by virtue of a treaty. Local councillors were elected using the D'Hondt method and a closed list proportional representation, with a threshold of five percent of valid votes—which included blank ballots—being applied in each local council. Parties not reaching the threshold were not taken into consideration for seat distribution. Councillors were allocated to municipal councils based on the following scale: {  left; font-size:95%;\\" - bgcolor=\\"#E9E9E9\\" align=\\"center\\" ! width=\\"120\\" Population ! width=\\"265\\" Councillors -  <250  5 -  251–1,000  7 -  1,001–2,000  9 -  2,001–5,000  11 -  5,001–10,000  13 -  10,001–20,000  17 -  20,001–50,000  21 -  50,001–100,000  25 -  >100,001  +1 per each 100,000 inhabitants or fraction +1 if total is an even number } The mayor was indirectly elected by the plenary assembly. A legal clause required that mayoral candidates earned the vote of an absolute majority of councillors, or else the candidate of the most-voted party in the assembly was to be automatically appointed to the post. In the event of a tie, a toss-up would determine the appointee. The electoral law allowed for parties and federations registered in the interior ministry, coalitions and groupings of electors to present lists of candidates. Parties and federations intending to form a coalition ahead of an election were required to inform the relevant Electoral Commission within ten days of the election call, whereas groupings of electors needed to secure the signature of a determined amount of the electors registered in the municipality for which they were seeking election, disallowing electors from signing for more than one list of candidates. For the case of Madrid, as its population was over 1,000,001, at least 8,000 signatures were required. ==Opinion polls== The table below lists voting intention estimates in reverse chronological order, showing the most recent first and using the dates when the survey fieldwork was done, as opposed to the date of publication. Where the fieldwork dates are unknown, the date of publication is given instead.

It is approximately long and flows through Jefferson Township, Madison Township, and Roaring Brook Township. The watershed of the stream has an area of . The stream flows through the Curtis Reservoir, which is dammed by the Curtis Dam. The surficial geology in the vicinity of the stream's mouth includes alluvium, Wisconsinan Till, and bedrock. ==Course== White Oak Run begins in Jefferson Township. It flows south-southwest for a few tenths of a mile and enters a lake. From the southern end of the lake, it flows south for several tenths of a mile before crossing Pennsylvania Route 590 and entering the Curtis Reservoir, where it flows southwest and enters Madison Township. At the southwestern edge of the reservoir, the stream turns west and enters Roaring Brook Township. A short distance further downstream, it reaches its confluence with Roaring Brook at the Elmhurst Reservoir. White Oak Run joins Roaring Brook upstream of its mouth. Tributaries White Oak Run has no named tributaries. However, it does have two unnamed tributaries, both of which enter the stream from the right. One of the tributaries reaches its confluence with White Oak Run in the Curtis Reservoir. ==Geography and geology== The elevation near the mouth of White Oak Run is above sea level. The elevation near the source of the stream is between . The surficial geology in the vicinity of the lower reaches of White Oak Run consists of alluvium. Slightly further from the stream, there are areas of a glacial or resedimented till known as Wisconsinan Till, as well as bedrock containing conglomeratic sandstone, sandstone, and shale. ==Watershed== The watershed of White Oak Run has an area of . A reach of the stream is within the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Moscow. A 72-acre (29-hectare) reservoir known as the Curtis Reservoir is situated on White Oak Run. It is dammed by the Curtis Dam. In the late 1970s, the dam was judged to be unsafe, but not in critical condition. The reason for this was an inadequate spillway that was only capable of handling 17 percent of the Probable Maximum Flood without overtopping the dam. A failure of the Curtis Dam could cause a failure of the Elmhurst Dam further downstream, which could lead to a loss of life. ==History== White Oak Run was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1193654. In the early 2000s, the Lackawanna River Watershed Conservation Plan recommended that Roaring Brook Township, Madison Township, and Jefferson Township include protection of Keyser Creek in their zoning plans. ==See also== *Rock Bottom Creek, next tributary of Roaring Brook going downstream *Kellum Creek, next tributary of Roaring Brook going upstream *List of rivers of Pennsylvania *List of tributaries of the Lackawanna River ==References== Category:Rivers of Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania Category:Tributaries of Roaring Brook (Lackawanna River) Category:Rivers of Pennsylvania ","title":"White Oak Run (Roaring Brook tributary)"},{"id":"46371834","text":"Michael Kantarovski (born 22 May 1995) is an Australian professional footballer who plays as a Midfielder for Lambton Jaffas in the National Premier Leagues Northern NSW.

They work on helping the best founders build great businesses and raise money. Their program includes online mentoring to the 10 most exciting startups from across the country over 6 weeks, connecting them with field experts. Following this, the startups undergo a 10-day mentorship program in Bangalore, learning from people who have built great companies themselves and networking with India's biggest investors. Throughout these 10 days, we give them a great place to live and work together. The program ends with the Grand Finale where these startups pitch before India's biggest investment firms and media houses. ==About== Conquest was started in 2004 as a business plan competition organised by a group of BITSians with the mission to help startups raise funds and pitch their ideas in an interactive session with potential investors. Over the years, Conquest's goals and visions have evolved in parallel with the pulse of the startup ecosystem prevalent in India. ==History== Started in 2004 as a business plan competition, Conquest went international in 2006 and since 2007, it started inviting successful entrepreneurs to share their insights. Conquest provided a network-building platform, not only for entrepreneurs all over India, but also for the students of BITS Pilani. Till 2007, the focus of Conquest was on mentoring new ideas through the startup phase. However, many of the business ideas introduced in the competition failed to launch. Participants in business plan competitions all over India were focusing more on making better presentations and less on their core business models. Changes were introduced in the format to attract good start-up participation and keep non-serious business plans from winning. The competition format changed during this period. Competitors submitted executive summaries of their ideas, and from these, the competition committee picked the top 100 most promising to forward to the judging panel. The judges winnowed the list to 30 entries who would then move to the next phase of the competition by preparing full business plans over a three-week period. Of these full plans, the judges selected five teams who then received mentoring for a period of six weeks prior to making a final 20 minute sales pitch to the judges, who then selected the winning team. ==Conquest 2011–2013== In 2011, Conquest received a facelift by bringing about a few worthwhile changes in the format. The startups were, for the first time, given the opportunity to choose their mentors, not one, but multiple mentors. Also, in the earlier one-on-one mentoring system, one mentor was connected to only one startup. However, 2011 onwards, each mentor is connected to multiple mentees of his choice, increasing his chances of coming across an impressive startup. This step ensured reiterated interest of the mentor in Conquest. Thus, in Conquest 2011, the mentor chose multiple startup ideas to mentor, at his own discretion. Another change that Conquest 2011 saw was a change in the medium of mentoring sessions. Instead of mere communicating through emails and telephone, the startups got the chance to meet mentors in a face-to-face session. The sessions were held across 4 cities in India - New Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore and Hyderabad simultaneously on July 22, 2011. ==Conquest 2015== In its 2015 edition, DCB Bank was roped in as the Title sponsor. Close to 1500 startups applied, filling a questionnaire related to them. Conquest 2015 had a more streamlined application process through a tie-up with Applyifi, a newly launched platforms for startups to make online pitch-decks for investors. Based upon the startups’ responses, startups were filtered down to 50 in number. After a 3-month-long mentoring session, 50 startups were brought down to 10. The Grand Finale took place at ITC Sheraton, New Delhi. Swagene, a Chennai based bio-tech startup, took the top honours and Gamezop, a New Delhi- based gaming platform, finished as runners-up. Conquest enjoyed media presence from more than 60 media houses including leading media houses like Deccan Chronicle, CNBC-TV, Times of India, Indian Express, First Post, Economic Times, Business Standard and the likes. Some of the notable mentions, who attended the finale, were Jagat Shah, V.N. Alok, Dev Khare, Rajesh Swahney, Samay Kohli, Neeru Sharma, Sanjay Nath and Satyen Kothari. ==Conquest 2016== Conquest 2016 aims to venture more into tier-II and tier-III cities, believing it to be the epicenter of next startup revolution. With registrations commencing from March 1, Conquest 2016 primarily focuses on accelerating the working of the startups. The summit aims at having interactive sessions with eminent personages and like-minded people for refinement of the startup model. ==Conquest 2019== Conquest 2019 invited applications from startups across the world and has received 650+ applications from startups registered in India, Singapore and other countries. The title sponsor for Conquest 2019 was LTI (Larsen & Toubro Infotech) and Deskera as associate partner. Conquest 2019 had a more streamlined application process through a tie-up with Applyifi and Startup Buddy, who helped with the shortlisting of top 15 startups for the mentorship stage. Each startup went through a 3-month-long mentoring session with various mentors in common sessions. A personal mentor was also assigned to each of the startups based on the need of the startups and selection by mentors. After 3 months' remote mentoring, a list of Top 11 startups was arrived at based on the feedback from mentors and questionnaire filled by startups. The top 11 startups went through further round of face-to-face mentoring and industry connect for a week at Bengaluru. The Grand Finale took place at The Leela Palace on 28 July 2019, Bengaluru. ScoutMyTrip, a Mumbai based travel-tech startup, took the top honours and HRBot, a Gurugram-based AI recruitment platform, finished as runners-up. ==References * Category:Entrepreneurship organizations Category:Competitions in India ","title":"Conquest (Start-up Challenge)"},{"id":"46371892","text":"Scottish Huntington's Association, also known as SHA, is a registered charity located in Scotland that supports families affected by the degenerative brain condition Huntington’s disease.

It can also be used to describe the ability of an ecosystem-- specifically, the environment and its living population-- to recover from damage. Resilience to minor disturbances is one characteristic feature of healthy ecosystems. Following major (lethal) disturbances, such as a fire or pest outbreak in a forest, an immediate return to the previous dynamic equilibrium will not be possible. Instead, pioneering species will occupy, compete for space, and establish themselves in the newly opened habitat. The new growth of seedlings and community assembly process is known as regeneration in ecology. As ecological succession sets in, a forest will slowly regenerate towards its former state within the succession (climax or any intermediate stage), provided that all outer parameters (climate, soil fertility availability of nutrients, animal migration paths, air pollution or the absence thereof, etc.) remain unchanged. In certain regions like Australia, natural wildfire is a necessary condition for a cyclically stable ecosystem with cyclic regeneration. ==Artificial disturbances== While natural disturbances are usually fully compensated by the rules of ecological succession, human interference can significantly alter the regenerative homeostatic faculties of an ecosystem up to a degree that self-healing will not be possible.

Built in 1845, it is an excellent local example of Greek Revival architecture, with a classical four-columned Greek temple front. The house is most notable as the long-time home of Rebecca Sophia Clarke (1833-1906), who wrote a series of popular children's books under the pen name \\"Sophie May\\". The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. ==Description and setting== The Sophie May House is set between Sophie May Lane and the Kennebec River to the south, just outside the main village of Norridgewock. It is a -story brick structure, with a front-facing gable roof, which projects beyond the front facade and is supported by four smooth Doric columns, with a fully pedimented flush-boarded gable end above. The main facade is three bays wide, with full-length windows in the two left bays and the entrance in the rightmost. The interior follows a typical side-hall plan, with the main parlor to the left, and kitchen and service area in ells attached to the rear of the house. The house was built in 1845 by Cullen Sawtelle, a native son who studied law at Bowdoin College and represented the area in Congress in the 1840s. In 1848 Sawtelle sold the house to Asa Clarke. Clarke's daughter, Rebecca, was educated at Norridgewock Female Academy and taught primary school in Illinois until advancing deafness forced her return. From 1861 until her death in 1906 she lived here, where she wrote more than forty volumes of children's stories, using realistic settings and characterizations drawn in part from her hometown, and in contrast to the prevailing style of didactic and moralizing children's literature. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Somerset County, Maine ==References== Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Maine Category:Greek Revival houses in Maine Category:Houses completed in 1845 Category:Houses in Somerset County, Maine Category:Norridgewock, Maine Category:National Register of Historic Places in Somerset County, Maine ","title":"Sophie May House"},{"id":"46371976","text":"James Miller was a Scottish amateur golfer.

The main argument concerns the import volume of catfish from Vietnam which results in lower profits for U.S. catfish producers. In dealing with major losses in profit, the Catfish Farmers of America (CFA), presented a series of lawsuits to the U.S. Department of Commerce against frozen catfish from Vietnam. First, the CFA filed for a food labeling claims which forced Vietnamese imported catfish to be labeled \\"Made in Vietnam\\". Next, the CFA accused the Vietnamese producers of dumping their products into the U.S. market. Most recently, a catfish quality investigation in program was implemented to verify the quality of catfish by Vietnamese producers. These claims from the CFA propose a trade barrier of catfish between Vietnam and the United States. The unresolved catfish disputes affect not only the producers but the consumers in both countries. ==Entry to U.S. market== After years of conflicts, the relationship between the U.S. and Vietnam was eventually brightened up when the embargo by the U.S. to Vietnam was lifted in 1995. Following this event, in December 2001, Vietnam and the U.S. signed a bilateral trade agreement (BTA) that resumed and formalized all trading status.The U.S.-Vietnam Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA) - Resources for Understanding Since the BTA became effective, Vietnam increasingly exports up to nearly $30.5 billion worth of their products including shoes, textiles, agricultural goods and other commodities to the U.S. In return, the U.S. exports approximately $5.5 billion in goods to Vietnam. Catfish was among the major exports of Vietnam to the U.S In 2014, catfish producers in Vietnam bred over 1.1 million tonnes and exported around 500 tonnes of catfish every month to the U.S. These figures represents 2 percent of fish consumed by American consumers. ==Trade war initiation== In the U.S., catfish is raised generally in Mississippi, Arkansas and Louisiana in ponds. With the increasing number of catfish imported from Vietnam, U.S. domestic producers began to worry about their profit margins. In 2002, Vietnamese catfish captured around 20 percent of American frozen fish market. In 2012, this figure went up to 60 percent. American catfish producers decided to take proper measurement eventually. The Association of Catfish Farmers of America represented these American domestic producers to file lawsuits against the mass imports of Vietnamese catfish starting in 2001. Food labeling claims In 2001, the CFA decided to propose a food label policy.Catfish Wars: Vietnam's Fight for Free Trade in the U.S. Court Of International Trade In particular, the CFA claimed that catfish from Vietnam was poor quality and biologically not catfish. The U.S. Senate favored this claim and passed a law implemented by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to require all Vietnamese catfish to be labeled either \\"Tra\\" or \\"Basa\\". In the following, a label \\"Made in Vietnam\\" was also required for any catfish imported from Vietnam. This action aimed to provide customers with more accurate and verifiable choice between foreign and domestically grown catfish. In addition, the CFA ran an ad that encouraged American consumers not to trust foreign catfish because of their breeding origin. The controversial action of food labeling claims posed a question whether this act aimed to protect consumers or to form a protectionism barrier against Vietnamese catfish. Food-labeling practices are considered a method of protectionism, it is important to have verifiable evidence for the claim. However, the FDA's claims that Vietnamese catfish were unsanitary without sufficient evidence or investigation could be misleading to consumers, and would put Vietnamese producers in a potentially unequal trade position. Anti-dumping In addition to the food labeling claims that implied Vietnamese catfish of being raised in poor condition, the CFA accused the Vietnamese producers of dumping their products in the U.S. market. Since the Vietnamese catfish prices continued to sell in the U.S. market despite of the food labeling action, the CFA claimed that Vietnamese catfish producers were heavily subsidized by the government. Therefore, their production costs were not accurate in reflecting the selling prices in the U.S. The U.S. required the Vietnamese producers to prove that they operated under free market condition without any government subsidy. The Vietnamese producers responded that their low costs of production were due to cheaper labor, and favorable producing conditions. The flowing water of the Mekong helped in washing the fish, which contributed to the lower costs. Nevertheless, a delegation from the Department of Commerce was sent to investigate the anti-dumping claims. In 2003, the CFA won the case of anti-dumping, and authorized tariffs of up to 64 percent on the Vietnamese catfish. Catfish quality inspection Despite of these trade barriers imposed by the U.S., Vietnamese catfish imports to the United States continues to rise. In 2008, the U.S. producers decided to lobby for another barrier to keep Vietnamese catfish out of the domestic market by propose an inspection requirement into the 2008 farm bill. According to this action, an inspection system was required so that all catfish production must meet the standard. This system is equivalent to U.S. inspections, which would be costly and significantly complicated to the Vietnamese producers to establish. The law also put the U.S. Department of Agriculture in charge of deciding the category and definition of catfish instead of the FDA. The catfish quality inspection requirement from the 2008 farm bill posed yet another massive trade barrier to Vietnamese catfish producers in exporting their goods to the U.S. market. ==Aftermath== The catfish trade disputes affect the Vietnamese producers significantly, since they have agreed to the quota imposed by the US. In April 2003, the Vietnam Association of Seafood Exporters and Producers (VASEP) agreed to cut shipment volumes from 2003 to 2005, with penalties for exceeding quota. One of the largest export products of Vietnam was restricted by a series of trade barriers to protect domestic producers, particularly, the CFA in this case. Nevertheless, the amount of frozen fish imported to the U.S. increased to 215 million pounds in 2014, which valued at more than $300 million a year. Despite of the lawsuits and lobby efforts, U.S. catfish producers saw production fall by nearly 50 percent from 630 million pounds in 2004 to around 340 million in 2013. With the additional costs of labels and adopting the new inspection system, domestic producers are considering to eliminate catfish from their productions. For American consumers, this trade dispute affected their budget negatively. Without the cheap catfish from Vietnam, U.S. consumers face higher prices from domestic producers. Consumers now will bear the costs of the label process as well as the USDA inspection requirement on each pound of catfish that they buy from domestic producers. Experts even predict that the action against foreign producers would force consumers to buy more Vietnamese catfish. Furthermore, other commodities and goods imported from Vietnam would likely to be at higher prices as Vietnam sought to retaliate in the dispute. ==Solution== The trade war for catfish has been unresolved for decades without a definite winner. Vietnamese officials have stated their concern of the new inspection program in 2008 as a disguise of protectionism. On the other hand, the USDA insists on moving forward with their inspection agenda. Efforts such as negotiations for the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement including Japan, Vietnam and the U.S. showed little progress in resolving this trade dispute. ==See also== *Byrd Amendment ==References== Category:Fish and humans Category:Aquaculture in the United States Category:Fishing in Vietnam Category:Economy of the United States Category:Fishing conflicts Category:United States–Vietnam relations ","title":"Catfish Dispute"},{"id":"46372032","text":"Eboda chloroclistis is a species of moth of the family Tortricidae.

Lewis was born in Aberystwyth, the second of four children of David John, a picture framer and photographer, and Mary Lewis.1911 Wales Census He served an apprenticeship at Williams and Metcalfe's Rheidol Foundry afterwards going to sea as an engineer. The subjects of Lewis's postcards were local events and scenery. Initially he concentrated on surrounding villages and hamlets, outings and local events rather than the standard views favoured by larger publishing houses. Many of the events such as the quarterly life-boat practice or garden parties would soon be forgotten by those who witnessed them. An exception to this was the visit of a travelling menagerie who chose to advertise their presence by marching their elephants through the town for a swim in the sea. Arthur Lewis photographed the event and the card proved hugely popular. Reprints still sell well at the local museum to this day. After the death of his father in 1921, Arthur Lewis took over the running of the family drygoods store, known as The Mart, with his two sisters, Eunice and Maggie. He subsequently became known locally in Welsh as Lewis Y Mart (Lewis the Mart). His elder brother kept the picture-framing element of the business on the other side of the street. Arthur Lewis was a keen local historian, active member of Tabernacle Chapel, superintendent of Trefechan Sunday School and keen sea fisherman. In March 1933 the premises were sold to the Aberystwyth & District Co-operative Society and the family business moved to a smaller shop in nearby North Parade. During the Second World War, Arthur Lewis served as Chief Coastguard and devoted little time to photography. He died in 1952 whilst on holiday in Liverpool. Subsequently, more than two thousand of his glass negatives were donated to the National Library of Wales. ==References== Category:1885 births Category:1952 deaths Category:Welsh photographers Category:Postcard publishers Category:People from Aberystwyth ","title":"Arthur Lewis (photographer)"},{"id":"46372283","text":"Life Investigation For Enceladus (LIFE) was a proposed astrobiology mission concept that would capture icy particles from Saturn's moon Enceladus and return them to Earth, where they could be studied in detail for signs of life such as biomolecules. The LIFE orbiter concept was proposed by a team led by Peter Tsou to NASA's 13th Discovery Mission solicitation, but the mission was not selected by NASA for Phase-A design study. ==Mission concept== hydrothermal activity on Enceladus. Enceladus is a small icy moon with jets or geysers of water erupting from its surface that might be connected to active hydrothermal vents at its subsurface water ocean floor,Ocean Within Enceladus May Harbor Hydrothermal Activity. March 11, 2015. where the moon's ocean meets the underlying rock, a prime habitat for life. The geysers could provide easy access for sampling the moon's subsurface ocean, and if there is microbial life in it, ice particles from the sea could contain the evidence astrobiologists need to identify them. 'tiger stripes' feature. The 15-year LIFE mission would use a 'Tanpopo' aerogel collector similar to the one NASA used in the Stardust sample return mission to return cometary dust in 2006. The proposed spacecraft would enter into Saturn orbit and enable multiple flybys through Enceladus's icy plumes. After spending about two years in orbit as slow as 2 km/s around Saturn, LIFE would use its propulsion system to escape Saturn and begin the ~4.5 year long voyage back to Earth with the collected particles in a return capsule. The spacecraft may sample Enceladus's plume, the E ring of Saturn, and the Titan upper atmosphere. In December 2014, NASA announced that it would be selecting finalists in June 2015 to submit proposals for a future Discovery Program mission, and selecting a winning proposal in September 2016. The selected mission must launch by the end of 2021. The mission would have a $425 million development cost cap, and it would reach Saturn after a series of gravity assists past Venus and the Earth. Samples from Enceladus's plume would make it to Earth about 14 years later. In September 2016, NASA announced that five proposals had been selected for further study. ==Science payload== The Stardust dust collector with aerogel blocks As currently envisioned, the probe's science payload would consist of: *an aerogel collector — for capture of particles at 2 km/s *a tool for collecting volatile chemicals *a mass spectrometer —CHIMPS, an upgraded ROSINA on Rosetta spacecraft *a camera — optical navigation shared with science to observe the dynamics of the jets *a dust counter — to confirm the flux of the jet particles encountered by the collectors The samples collected would be returned to Earth for extensive analyses. ==See also== * Abiogenesis * Astrobiology * Discovery Program * Enceladus Explorer * Enceladus Life Finder * Europa Clipper * Explorer of Enceladus and Titan (E2T) * Journey to Enceladus and Titan * THEO ==References== Category:Discovery program proposals Category:Enceladus Category:Missions to Saturn Category:Proposed NASA space probes Category:Proposed astrobiology space missions ","title":"Life Investigation For Enceladus"},{"id":"46372287","text":"Mr. Tom Mr. Tom is a candy bar containing roasted peanuts and caramel.

High Street, Aberystwyth, Photographed by Gwyn Martin c.1955 ==Wartime experience== Gwyn Martin was still at school when he enlisted with the Royal Air Force (RAF) at the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939. After completing his training at No. 15 Operational Training Unit as a navigator in April 1941, he joined No. 75 Squadron RAF at RAF Feltwell flying the Vickers Wellington bomber. Three months and 20 missions later he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Medal after a daylight bombing of the docks at Brest inflicting further damage to the German battleship Gneisenau. His aircraft Wellington 1457 \\"P\\" was severely damaged with repeated attacks by four ME109's. Pilot Officer Curry returned the damaged aircraft for a high speed crash landing at Boscombe Down without wheels or flaps. Martin finished his first \\"tour\\" before his 20th birthday and spent the next six months at No. 12 Operational Training Unit as a Check Navigator / Bomb Aimer before returning for a second \\"tour\\" in May 1942 with a posting to No. 150 Squadron RAF at RAF Snaith. In October 1942, on the day after his 21st birthday, Wellington BK.309 \\"N” was on a minelaying mission in Haugesund. The aircraft was hit by flak and severely damaged while flying at 600 feet at night. Pilot Officer Ken Rees managed to ditch the burning aircraft in a small inland lake (Langavatnet / Tysvaer) (The wreckage of the aircraft were discovered by Martin during a visit to Norway in 1964 along with the remains of the rear gunner). Flight Sergeant Don Taylor and Flight Sergeant Harry Dalziel were killed while the rest of the crew were captured and spent the next two and a half years as prisoners of war in Stalag Luft III near Zagan in Poland.

All 57 seats in the City Council were up for election. The election was held simultaneously with regional elections in thirteen autonomous communities and local elections all throughout Spain. The People's Party (PP), People's Alliance new electoral brand, went on to win a City Council election in Madrid for the first time with an absolute majority of seats. The Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) continued its decline in the city and lost 3 seats and around 150,000 votes, while United Left (IU) recovered from its 1987 debacle and, for the first time since 1979, increased in seats and votes. The ruling Democratic and Social Centre (CDS), whose local leader Agustín Rodríguez Sahagún had announced his intention not to run for re-election, all but disappeared from the Council after failing to meet the required 5% threshold. As a result of the election, José María Álvarez del Manzano was elected Mayor unopposed, a post he would retain until 2003, becoming the longest-serving democratically elected Mayor of Madrid. ==Electoral system== The City Council of Madrid () was the top-tier administrative and governing body of the municipality of Madrid, composed of the mayor, the government council and the elected plenary assembly. Elections to the local councils in Spain were fixed for the fourth Sunday of May every four years. Voting for the local assembly was on the basis of universal suffrage, which comprised all nationals over eighteen, registered in the municipality of Madrid and in full enjoyment of their political rights, as well as resident non-nationals whose country of origin allowed Spanish nationals to vote in their own elections by virtue of a treaty. Local councillors were elected using the D'Hondt method and a closed list proportional representation, with a threshold of five percent of valid votes—which included blank ballots—being applied in each local council. Parties not reaching the threshold were not taken into consideration for seat distribution. Councillors were allocated to municipal councils based on the following scale: {  left; font-size:95%;\\" - bgcolor=\\"#E9E9E9\\" align=\\"center\\" ! width=\\"120\\" Population ! width=\\"265\\" Councillors -  <250  5 -  251–1,000  7 -  1,001–2,000  9 -  2,001–5,000  11 -  5,001–10,000  13 -  10,001–20,000  17 -  20,001–50,000  21 -  50,001–100,000  25 -  >100,001  +1 per each 100,000 inhabitants or fraction +1 if total is an even number } The mayor was indirectly elected by the plenary assembly. A legal clause required that mayoral candidates earned the vote of an absolute majority of councillors, or else the candidate of the most-voted party in the assembly was to be automatically appointed to the post. In the event of a tie, a toss-up would determine the appointee. The electoral law allowed for parties and federations registered in the interior ministry, coalitions and groupings of electors to present lists of candidates. Parties and federations intending to form a coalition ahead of an election were required to inform the relevant Electoral Commission within ten days of the election call, whereas groupings of electors needed to secure the signature of a determined amount of the electors registered in the municipality for which they were seeking election, disallowing electors from signing for more than one list of candidates. For the case of Madrid, as its population was over 1,000,001, at least 8,000 signatures were required. ==Opinion polls== The table below lists voting intention estimates in reverse chronological order, showing the most recent first and using the dates when the survey fieldwork was done, as opposed to the date of publication. Where the fieldwork dates are unknown, the date of publication is given instead. The highest percentage figure in each polling survey is displayed with its background shaded in the leading party's colour. If a tie ensues, this is applied to the figures with the highest percentages. The \\"Lead\\" column on the right shows the percentage-point difference between the parties with the highest percentages in a given poll. When available, seat projections are also displayed below the voting estimates in a smaller font. 29 seats were required for an absolute majority in the City Council of Madrid. { class=\\" collapsible collapsed\\" center; font-size:95%; line- height:16px;\\" - style=\\"height:42px; background-color:#E9E9E9\\" !

Born on 6 April 1883 in Stalybridge, Cheshire, the fifth child of a cotton mule spinner, he initially became an assistant librarian but studied photography and spent a great deal of his spare time travelling about the Stalybridge area taking photographs. In 1913 he married Miss Bertha Shaw and the couple had two daughters, Edith and Margaret. For a while he worked as a photographic representative and then in 1925 he and the family moved to Criccieth, Caernarfonshire, where he rented London House, a shop with living accommodation aboveand it opened as a Toy and Fancy Goods shop. Later additions to the lines offered were music and records, stationery, books, and \\"The latest picture postcards\\". He continued his photography and in 1926 produced his first postcards of the Criccieth area and from then until his retirement (because of failing health) in 1958 his shop window featured a regular display of post cards for sale. The business was always a family affair and no other staff were employed in the shop or postcard business. Although unknown to his surviving daughters it would appear that he came to an agreement with two other local postcard in Porthmadog and Pwllheli about the areas each would cover. Harwood kept the area as a far east of Criccieth as far as Blackrock Sands and as far west as Afon Wen, and the other two never venturedonto his territory. Although a business, it would appear that the main reason for his producing postcards was his love of photography, and once again his spare time was spent walking, always with a camera. This usually was a Goertz Plate Camera, which he referred to as his press camera\\" which he used for the majority of his postcard production. Other cameras he owned and used at various times were a Thornton Pickard 1/2 plate Field Camera, a Thornton Pickard 1/4 plate \\"Sanderson\\", a Thornton Pickard 1/4 plate \\"Ruby Reflex\\" and a \\"Nydia\\" – an old camera with a washlether bag attached for changing plates. The developing and printing of the postcards, which were all black and white and real photographic, was all carried out in the basement below the shop. In 1974, at the instigation of Mr. James Young of Bank House, Criccieth, next door to William Harwood's former shop, the 1500 remaining negatives from his production went to the National Library of Wales in Aberystwyth, a fact that gave him great satisfaction to know that his work would be preserved for future generations. In 1982, the library selected about 300 negatives to re-print and this collection of his work is kept in the print room for modern collectors to view. William Harwood died of a stroke in 1976 at the age of 93, leaving behind him a legacy of superbly-composed middle period postcards. ==References== Category:1883 births Category:1976 deaths Category:Postcard publishers Category:Welsh photographers ","title":"William Harwood (photographer)"},{"id":"46372410","text":"Credito Valtellinese (Creval) is an Italian bank based in Sondrio, Lombardy, Italy.

The bank is named after the area Valtellina. The bank had 363 branches in Northern Italy (as Credito Valtellinese), 40 branches in Marche and Umbria (former Carifano), and 133 branches in Sicily (as Credito Siciliano). Credito Siciliano had three more branches outside the island of Sicily. It had a market share of 32% in Sondrio. However, only 2.9% in whole Lombardy region in terms of deposits, as of 30 June 2014, as well as only 1.7% in terms of branches as the 10th of Italy. ==History== Credito Valtellinese is a former co-operative bank based in Sondrio found in 1908, as Banca Piccolo Credito Valtellinese. (Not to be confused with Banca Popolare di Sondrio) The bank expanded by the acquisition of Technoleasing (later Bancaperta) in the 1980s and Credito Artigiano in 1996, which was the parent company of Banca dell'Artigianato e dell'Industria. In 2002 Sicilian banks Banca Popolare Santa Venera in Acireale, Cassa San Giacomo in Caltagirone and Banca Regionale Sant'Angelo were merged to become Credito Siciliano.

From 2004 to 2013, Creval was a minority shareholder of Banca di Cividale. In 2016 the bank was demutualized, being registered as a Banca Popolare. The new Italian Law N°3/2015 required that banks with more than €8 billion total assets in that category had to be transformed into a società per azioni. The withdrawal price for the shareholders was set at €0.4747 per share. At the same time a plan to combine 10 old shares to 1 new share was announced. ==Equity investments== Credito Valtellinese was a minority shareholder of Global Assistance S.p.A.

He was educated at John Roysse's Free School in Abingdon (now Abingdon School).

Scottish fir trees at Kirtington demonstrated his politics. He belonged to the Loyal Brotherhood, a Tory drinking club that also served as a London focus for party organisation, with other local MPs.Linda J.

Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/2639125 The Old Interest locally held drinking club sessions at which the Young Pretender was lauded, into the 1750s. At this period Tory political planning was low key, in meetings that resembled social events: one such dinner was held at Dashwood's house on 29 February 1756, at which voting rights were discussed. He was awarded an honorary D.C.L. by the University of Oxford, and the city made him High Steward. ==In politics== In 1738 Dashwood was High Sheriff of Oxfordshire. He became Tory Member of Parliament for , unopposed, in 1740 on the death of Sir William Stapleton, 4th Baronet, standing again in 1741. He moved swiftly to call for the repeal of the Jewish Naturalization Act 1753 in October of the year of its passing (he had not previously made a speech on the House, and had not prepared the ground for this one); he also at that period spoke against the Plantation Act 1740. The general election of 1754 saw confusion reign in Oxfordshire. Dashwood at this time faced serious political opposition, from Lady Susanna Keck at Great Tew as well as the Whig candidates. In the end four members were returned for the two-man constituency. In the subsequent legal proceedings, Dashwood and his Tory colleague Viscount Wenman were ousted, despite advice from distinguished lawyers including Roger Newdigate and William Blackstone. In 1761 a Tory–Whig deal was struck locally with the Duke of Marlborough, and Dashwood returned to Parliament once more, unopposed. He was not an active member, though he took a serious interest in enclosure bills, and retired from politics in 1768.W. E.

Soderholtz Cottage is a historic house on Maine State Route 186 in West Gouldsboro, Maine. Built in 1902, it is a fine local example of rustic Craftsman architecture. It was built by Eric Ellis Soderholtz, an artist noted around the turn of the 20th century for his architectural photography and his Arts and Crafts pottery. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. ==Description and history== The Solderholtz Cottage is set on the east side of South Gouldsboro Road (Maine State Route 186), about south of its junction with United States Route 1, on a neck of land separating freshwater Jones Pond from Jones Cove, an inlet of Frenchman Bay. It occupies a high point on , which is approached by a curving private lane from the north. It is a rambling single-story building, fashioned out of wood and fieldstone, which approximates a Greek cross in shape. It has a hip roof with flared eaves and exposed rafter ends in the Craftsman style. A concrete patio extends along the southern and western sides, lined on the west by a low stone wall. A breezeway on the south side joins the main structure to a two- room wood frame structure, which is believed to have served as a studio space. The house interior also has numerous Craftsman features, including exposed rafter beams and tilework by the Grueby Faience Company of Boston. The initial portion of the house was the subject of an article in the July 1903 edition of Country Living in America. Construction of the cottage began in 1902, after Eric Ellis Soderholtz (1867-1959) purchased two parcels of land, providing a high point in the area and access to Frenchman Bay. Originally an L-shaped structure, it was gradually expanded during Soderholtz' lifetime to achieve its present form. Soderholtz, who immigrated from Sweden as a child, achieved a reputation in the late 19th century as a photographer of architecture and landscape, with his work appearing in journals and monographs of the period. In the 20th century he achieved further notice as a creator of concrete garden sculptures, which he created by hand-turning them (the way clay pots are made by hand) rather than using molds. His work was marketed and sold into the exclusive summer colonies of Mount Desert Island, and as far off as Newport, Rhode Island. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Hancock County, Maine ==References== Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Maine Category:Houses completed in 1902 Category:Houses in Hancock County, Maine Category:National Register of Historic Places in Hancock County, Maine ","title":"Eric E.

There were many in the area due to the large number of country houses and estates. He was also a keen astronomer, naturalist, bee-keeper and horticulturist. Cilgerran and the surrounding area at that time was a thriving commercial centre and had a number of successful industries with twelve slate quarries as well a very productive agricultural scene. He was well connected with the local gentry, primarily due to the Gower family, of Castle Malgwyn Estate as his wife was a former governess to them. This family provided him with many opportunities for a successful career through their social importance in the locality. Apart from his professional interests he was also a documentary photographer of local flora, fauna and every aspect of the domestic and social life of the gentry and their houses. His work is a valuable and varied view of the community and social life of Bro Teifi in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. == Surviving collection Of negatives== In 1980, James Maxwell (Maxi) Davies, Chief Photographer at the R.A.E. Aberporth rescued and restored much of Matthias' glass negatives from his former home at Aberdyfan, Cilgerran. Without Davies' work, these photos would have been lost.

A midfielder, tall and weighing , Brayshaw is capable of contributing as both an inside and outside midfielder. He has strong family connections in Australian sport whereby his father, Mark Brayshaw, is a former player and the current AFL Coaches' Association Chief Executive Officer, his uncle, James Brayshaw, is a former state cricketer, former North Melbourne chairman and a sport media personality, and his grandfather, Ian Brayshaw, is a former state cricketer and footballer with the Claremont Football Club. Brayshaw played top-level football early when he played in the TAC Cup for the Sandringham Dragons as a bottom-aged player, in addition to representing Victoria at under 16 level, and continued to represent the state which culminated in selection for Vic Metro in the 2014 AFL Under 18 Championships. His achievements at junior level included the most valuable player award at state level, the best on ground academy player, and selection in the All- Australian team and TAC Cup team of the year. He was recruited by Melbourne with the third overall selection in the 2014 AFL draft and he made his debut during the 2015 season, resulting in a fifth-place finish in the AFL Rising Star award. ==Early life== Brayshaw was born to Mark and Debra Brayshaw in Western Australia. He was born into a sporting family with his grandfather, Ian, representing Western Australia in cricket and is a premiership player with Western Australian Football League club, Claremont. His uncle James played first-class cricket for Western Australia and South Australia and his father played 32 matches for the North Melbourne Football Club. Brayshaw attended Haileybury College and played his junior football with the Hampton Rovers Football Club. He was recognised as an elite talent at a young age when he received a scholarship with the Australian Institute of Sport through the AIS-AFL Academy as part of their level one squad in the 2012 intake. In the same year, he was selected to play with Vic Metro in the under 16 championships and was awarded the most valuable player for Vic Metro. He played five matches as a bottom-aged player in the TAC Cup for the Sandringham Dragons in 2013 and after being ineligible for the 2013 AFL draft by missing the age cut-off date by nine days, Brayshaw spent 2014 competing in junior competitions and studying a double degree in commerce and engineering at Monash University. He was selected as part of the level two squad in the 2013 intake for the AIS-AFL Academy and travelled to Europe for two weeks in April 2014 with a 31-man squad. At the start of the tour, Brayshaw was awarded the MCC Chairman's Medal as the best academy player after competing in a match against 's Victorian Football League (VFL) side at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Playing for the Sandringham Dragons in the TAC Cup in 2014, Brayshaw was regarded as one of the top draft prospects for the 2014 AFL draft and was appointed captain of Sandringham. He earned mid-year state honours through selection for Vic Metro in the Under 18 Championships and was rewarded with All-Australian selection as a half-back flanker. In addition, his efforts in the TAC Cup saw him secure a spot in the team of the year as a ruck-rover. Brayshaw was highly rated among recruiters in his final junior year and was likened to captain, Joel Selwood, for his \\"fearless attack on the ball\\", he was also rated as a potential number one draft pick by AFL national talent manager, Kevin Sheehan. He was appraised as the player who would have the biggest impact in their first season due to his body size and natural leadership. ==AFL career== Brayshaw at training in July 2015 Brayshaw was linked to the Melbourne Football Club in the weeks leading to the draft and was ultimately recruited by the club with their second selection and third overall in the 2014 national draft. He was predicted to make a round one debut after strong performances with Melbourne's affiliate team, the Casey Scorpions, in Victorian Football League (VFL) practice matches, despite not featuring for Melbourne in the NAB Challenge. He debuted in the twenty-six point win against at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in round one and laid a match-high nine tackles before being substituted off in the fourth quarter. After a string of consistent performances, he was awarded the round ten nomination for the Rising Star for his efforts in the annual Queen's Birthday Clash against , in which he recorded eighteen disposals, six tackles, seven inside-50s, four goal assists, and a goal. His performance was praised by former Melbourne captain, Garry Lyon, and he noted that Brayshaw would be a \\"200-gamer and leader of the Demons.\\" Brayshaw missed only one match during his debut season due to being rested against at Domain Stadium in round 22. His season was acclaimed within the AFL industry, particularly his mid-season form, where his tenacity and desperation around the ball was highlighted with comparisons to Joel Selwood, in addition to former captain, Jonathan Brown, commending his toughness. He was noted as an equal favourite for the Rising Star alongside midfielder, Patrick Cripps, by Herald Sun chief football writer, Mark Robinson, after his performance against in round 12. He ultimately finished fifth in the award after a drop in form in the second-half of the season. He was recognised among his peers by finishing second in the AFL Players Association best first year player award, behind midfielder, Isaac Heeney, furthermore, he finished eleventh in Melbourne's best and fairest count. Brayshaw was highly rated by the AFL players heading into the 2016 season whereby he was named the second best player in the league recruited from the 2014 and 2015 drafts. In the opening match of the 2016 NAB Challenge against , he injured his knee five seconds into the match after a tackle from Port Adelaide midfielder, Hamish Hartlett, and the injury forced him to miss the remainder of the pre-season competition. In a bid to play in the round one match against , he played for Casey in a VFL practice match where he recorded seventeen disposals and a goal. He ultimately missed the round one win against Greater Western Sydney and played his first AFL match for the season in round two in the thirteen point loss against at the Melbourne Cricket Ground where he recorded nine disposals. He was omitted the next week for the match against at Blundstone Arena due to looking \\"tired\\". Brayshaw returned the next week and played in the round four and five wins against Collingwood and , in which he garnered fifteen and nine disposals respectively before being dropped again for the round six match against at Etihad Stadium. The same weekend in the VFL match against , he sustained a concussion after a football kicked by teammate, Alex Neal-Bullen, hit him in the back of the head. Two weeks later, he suffered a second concussion when he had a head clash in the VFL match against and he was placed on the sidelines for an \\"extended period of time\\". He played his first match in four weeks when he played for Casey against , where he accumulated twenty-nine disposals and kicked two goals. He returned to the senior side in the thirty-six point loss against at Etihad Stadium in round 17 in which he recorded twenty-three disposals and seven clearances. He played the remainder of the season and finished with ten matches in total for the season, which saw him fall to twenty-third in Melbourne's best and fairest count. Brayshaw warming up prior to a pre-season match in February 2017 Brayshaw had a reduced workload in the 2017 pre-season after injuring his calf in January and played the first two matches of the AFL season before he was omitted from the senior side for the round three match against Geelong at Etihad Stadium. AFL Media reporter, Ben Guthrie, noted the calf injury was a key reason for his slow start to the season and he was yet to live up to his potential due to persistent injuries throughout his early career. Former Melbourne coach, Paul Roos, noted that although the public hadn't seen Brayshaw's best yet, he was Melbourne's most exciting prospect for 2017. In late April playing in the VFL, he received his third concussion in twelve months after receiving a bump from North Ballarat player, Hayden Walters. There were suggestions by the media that the multiple concussions in a short period of time would prematurely end his AFL career, however, these claims were quickly dismissed by Melbourne with head of football, Josh Mahoney, saying it was only a minor concussion. Brayshaw missed three weeks of football and in his return match in the VFL against the , he was concussed again when he was bumped by Carlton listed player, Jed Lamb. With the club saying they would \\"map out a plan\\" to ensure he could play consistent football without the risk of concussion, reports emerged that the club had granted him indefinite leave to recover from his fourth concussion in twelve months. He was training two days after the reports emerged, with senior coach, Simon Goodwin, stating the reports of indefinite leave were inaccurate but Brayshaw would not return to playing for a while. He missed nine weeks of football before returning in the VFL round fourteen match against wearing a helmet after receiving advice from former St Kilda player, Nathan Burke, who received multiple bumps during his career. He returned to the AFL for the twenty-four point win against St Kilda in round twenty-one at the Melbourne Cricket Ground; in the first quarter he received a heavy bump from Koby Stevens, however, he was uninjured from the collision. Former player and commentator during the match, Jason Dunstall, noted all the commentators were worried straight after bump, but Brayshaw recovered and \\"used the ball well and made good decisions. [Dunstall] thought it was a fantastic fight back from when we had our heart in our mouths\\" and he was named in Melbourne's best players by AFL Media, the Herald Sun and The Age. He played the remainder of the season and finished with five AFL matches. Brayshaw'a performances during the 2018 AFL season showed the competition what he is capable of, averaging a career high 26.1 disposals and kicking 14 goals for the season, with the Demons having vastly improved season, eventually making the preliminary final. Brayshaw's 2018 season was highlighted with a 37 disposal, 3 goal game against the Adelaide Crows in Round 10. As well as a career high of 39 disposals and a goal the next week. His season was capped off with a 3rd place finish in the 2018 Brownlow medal, polling 21 votes. ==Statistics== : Statistics are correct to the end of round 1, 2020 - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text- align:center\\"  2015   10  21  5  3  170  97  267  54  99  0.2  0.1  8.1  4.6  12.7  2.6  4.7  0 - ! scope=\\"row\\" center\\"  2016   10  10  7  2  83  93  176  30  42  0.7  0.2  8.3  9.3  17.6  3.0  4.2  0 - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" center\\"  2017   10  5  2  1  53  42  95  28  12  0.4  0.2  10.6  8.4  19.0  5.6  2.4  0 - ! scope=\\"row\\" center\\"  2018   10  22  14  10  322  252  574  108  99  0.6  0.5  14.6  11.5  26.1  4.9  4.5  21 - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" center\\"  2019   10  22  9  7  278  209  487  87  96  0.4  0.3  12.6  9.5  22.1  4.0  4.4  0 - ! scope=\\"row\\" center\\"  2020   10  1  0  2  8  10  18  3  2  0.0  2.0  8.0  10.0  18.0  3.0  2.0  – - class=\\"sortbottom\\" ! colspan=3 Career ! 81 ! 37 ! 25 ! 914 ! 703 ! 1617 ! 310 ! 350 ! 0.5 ! 0.3 ! 11.3 ! 8.7 ! 20.0 ! 3.8 ! 4.3 ! 21 } ==References* *Angus Brayshaw's profile from Demonwiki Category:1996 births Category:Living people Category:Melbourne Football Club players Category:Sandringham Dragons players Category:Australian rules footballers from Victoria (Australia) Category:People educated at Haileybury, Melbourne Category:Casey Demons players ","title":"Angus Brayshaw"},{"id":"46372509","text":"Exeristeboda chlorocosma is a species of moth of the family Tortricidae.

She was educated at Otago Girls' High School. In 1940, she was the New Zealand junior champion in 50 and 100 yards freestyle and 50 yards backstroke, equalling the national junior record in the latter event. In 1943 she broke the national intermediate 100 yards backstroke record, and the following year she broke the national senior record for 220 yards backstroke, thus becoming the first female swimmer to hold junior, intermediate and senior national records concurrently. She was the national champion for the 100 yards and 220 yards backstroke every year from 1944 to 1949, and in 1947 she also won the 100 yards medley and 50 yards freestyle titles. Lane travelled to London in 1948 as the only swimmer and only woman on the New Zealand team at the Olympic Games. Before the games, she swam in the 1948 ASA British Championships 110 yards backstroke and won the event. At the Olympics, she reached the semi-finals of the 100 m backstroke, where she finished seventh in a time of 1:19.0. At the conclusion of the Olympic swim meet, Lane was part of an Australasian team that finished third in the 4 × 100 m freestyle relay at the Continental Relay Gala. On 21 May 1949, Lane married Kenneth Miller Galloway—a medical student at the University of Otago—in Thames. He died in 2007. The last surviving member of the 1948 New Zealand Olympic team, Galloway is New Zealand's oldest living Olympian. In 2011, she was inducted into Nelson's Legends of Sport.

It is a rhizomatous perennial from the deserts of Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. They have grass-like leaves and lilac-violet or blue-purple flowers on a tall slender stem. It is cultivated as an ornamental plant in temperate regions. ==Description== Iris longiscapa is very similar in form to Iris songarica.Gustave Gintzburger The plant has a short, small rhizome. It produces small, nut-like segments, (which are smaller than Iris falcifolia), one per year, that spread to create small creeping, dense tufts of plants. On top of the rhizome are the fibrous remains of the previous seasons leaves. Underneath, it has plenty of thick roots. It has basal, green, grass-like or filiform (thread-like) linear leaves. They are narrow, deciduous and between wide.British Iris Society (1997) The leaves are much narrower and straighter than Iris falcifolia. The stem (or peduncle) is slender and can grow between long. It is more longer and slender than Iris falcifolia, but shorter than Iris songarica. The stems have 3 spathes (leaves of the flower bud), which are narrow and are acuminated (ending in a sharp point), and they have a hyaline (clear and translucent) or membranous margin. The spathes have a small peduncle (stalk) that are between long. The stems hold short pedicels (flower stalks), which are long, they hold 2–5 flowers, between April and May. The flowers are in diameter, they are slightly smaller than Iris falcifolia, but smaller than Iris songarica. They come in shades of lilac-violet, or blue- purple, It has 2 pairs of petals, 3 large sepals (outer petals), known as the 'falls' and 3 inner, smaller petals (or tepals), known as the 'standards'. The falls are oblong shaped, and have darker veins along the margins. In the centre of the falls, is a large, white, clavate (shaped like a club) beard. It has a fine yellow centre. The standards are erect, narrowly spatulate and can sometimes have hairs. The flowers are bisexual and actinomorphic (meaning have radial symmetry). After the iris has flowered, it produces a pointed, 3-angled, or 3-edged seed capsule that is long. Biochemistry Since most irises are diploid, having two sets of chromosomes, this can be used to identify hybrids and classification of groupings. It has a chromosome count: 2n=18, carried out by Zakharyeva in 1985. == Taxonomy== It is known locally as 'teke-sakal (in Turkmenistan) and kacathk (in Uzbekistan). The Latin specific epithet longiscapa refers to long, slender stem, or long scape. It was first published and described by Carl Friedrich von Ledebour in 'Flora Rossica sive Enumeratio Plantarum in Totius Imperii Rossici Provinciis Europaeis, Asiaticis, et Americanis Hucusque Observatarum. Stuttgartiae' (Fl. Ross.) Vol.4 Issue 12, page 93 in April 1852. It was also published in 'Mém. Acad. Imp. Sci. St.-Pétersbourg Divers Savans' Vol.7 page 505 in 1854. The synonym Iris filifolia Boiss. was published in 'Voy. Espagne' (1839–45) page602 in 1839. It has never been illustrated except for a small drawing of one flower published in Komarov's 'Flora USSR' in Vol.4, table 34 in 1935. On 2 October 2014, it was verified by the United States Department of Agriculture and the Agricultural Research Service. ==Distribution and habitat== Iris longiscapa is a native to temperate regions of Central Asia. Range It is found in (the former states of USSR), of Kazakhstan, Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan,AP Mabuza and Uzbekistan. It is also found in Iran, or the Turanian deserts.Siegmar-W. Breckle, Walter Wucherer, Liliya A. Dimeyeva and Nathalia P. Ogar (Editors) They are specifically found in the deserts of Kara Kum and Kyzyl Kum. Habitat It is a (psammophyte) and grows in the sandy- clay deserts, or on granite hills. The soils contain NoH. It is also found in the Turanian gypsophilic (gypsum-loving) sagebrush lands of Kazakhstan, growing with Gagea reticulata, Nonea caspica and Tulipa sogdiana. ==Uses== A harvest of dry leaves of the iris are used as a litter for cattle in barns in Uzbekistan. It is eaten in spring by sheep in .J. R. Goodin and David K. Northington (Editors) Cultivation Iris longiscapa is cultivated as an ornamental plant, though it is rare. It is not hardy in Europe, and should be grown in a pot or a cold greenhouse. It is grown in loamy soils, in full sun with good drainage. It needs to rest and be dry over summer, after it flowers. It needs to be grown in full sun. A specimen was sent to Saint Petersburg Botanical Garden. ==References== Other sources * Czerepanov, S. K. 1995.

It stars Frank Grillo, Anna Torv and Shree Crooks. The film had its world premiere at the Overlook Film Festival on April 27, 2017. It was released through video on demand on April 17, 2018, by Universal Pictures. ==Plot== Stephanie is a young girl who was abandoned by her parents in their home. With only a toy turtle to talk to, there is also a dark supernatural force watching over her. An apocalyptic event is alluded to on various news broadcasts, but Stephanie channel-surfs past them to watch Despereaux, Equestria Girls and Friendship is Magic. It is revealed that she is keeping the corpse of her brother, Paul, in his bed to occasionally yell at and physically abuse. After they make up, she sometimes holds his cold hand, which squeezes her back. As she does whimsical things like tea parties with stuffed animals, a shadowy figure will menace her, but the scene will end with a jump scare of her waking up in her bed. Stephanie’s parents, Eric and Jane, eventually return and apologize for leaving her. They bury Paul's corpse in the yard and attempt to resume a normal life. Eric keeps a gun in his belt at all times. Jane has large scars across her stomach. That night, Paul's corpse is catapulted through the attic window, causing distress to Eric and Jane, but leaving Stephanie unaffected. The next morning, Eric asks her to tell them about the day they left. Stephanie and Paul had been carving pumpkins. When Paul teased her and damaged her pumpkin, she broke his neck with her telekinesis. When Jane came to investigate, she was struck across the midsection. Stephanie's telekinesis takes the form of giant invisible octopus tentacles. Eric and Jane reveal there is no monster: the monster is Stephanie. She was hallucinating the shadowy figure that had been harassing her. Her parents drug her and attempt to perform brain surgery to nullify her powers. Stephanie wakes up and telekinetically destroys the lab. News broadcasts explain that the apocalyptic event is that murderous, telekinetic children like Stephanie have been appearing all over the world, and there is no cure for their powers or murderous urges: they must be killed. Stephanie acts as if nothing has happened the next morning. Eric and Jane poison some hot cocoa intended for her. Eric explains his theory that a force is possessing Stephanie and the other children. When in this state, Stephanie occasionally develops dark patches on her face, lending credence to this theory. Stephanie prepares to drink the cocoa, but her telekinesis autonomously knocks it out of her hand. She moves to attack Eric, and he shoots her several times, seemingly killing her. Stephanie returns home, unharmed, tortures and kills her parents, and tells them they should've never come back. She telekinetically destroys the house and walks outside, dragging her parents’ corpses and leaving them at Paul's grave. She then drops and steps on her toy turtle, presumably showing that she is now possessed by the force, and destroys all the other houses in the neighborhood. Her shadow is shown to have long tentacles. The movie ends by zooming out to show the Earth: there are fires all over, showing that the other telekinetic children are similarly wreaking destruction around the world. ==Cast== * Frank Grillo as Dad, Eric * Anna Torv as Mom, Jane * Shree Crooks as Stephanie * Jonah Beres as Paul * Lausaundra Gibson as TV Reporter * Samantha Smith as Doctor * Harold Perrineau as Leader (uncredited) ==Production== Deadline announced that Akiva Goldsman signed on to direct the film and that Blumhouse Productions, Gotham Group, Unbroken Pictures and Matt Kaplan with Chapter One Films would produce.

In over thirty films he embodied \\"Boubagra\\", a naive peasant alter ego full of good sense and wisdom in the face of staggering socioeconomic changes. The chance he had wanted since childhood came in 1940 when Mahieddine Bachtarzi's theatre company travelled through region of Berrouaghia, where he was a hairdresser. Encouraged by Bachtarzi, El Hassani wrote his first play, Hassan's Dreams -- a satire denouncing colonialism. The ideas in the play led to his arrest and imprisonment on May 8, 1945. In prison, he created many sketches to boost morale among the prisoners. Released at the end of World War II, he moved to the Casbah of Algiers where he worked as a barber, and also in theater. He created the character of Na'anaa in the play El-houria which became, in 1950, \\"the plot\\" then \\"tigoule ou ti ghoul pas.\\" After the troupe disbanded, he was hired in 1953 to act on television under . His first drama was \\"La poursuite\\" (The Chase) When the Algerian war for independence broke out, he was totally committed to the fight.

He is best known as the founding Chairman of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region and later for seizing power in Shanxi during the Cultural Revolution, where he made himself the top leader of the province. Liu spent his early days as a communist agitator, leading peasant uprisings and building the party organization in rural areas. A political survivor, he was arrested several times during the Warlord Era and served two prison terms. After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, he held important roles in the party and government but was branded a traitor in 1960. He later returned to work, only to be purged again several years later during the Cultural Revolution. He was rehabilitated after the Cultural Revolution and spent the rest of his life in ceremonial positions. ==Republic of China== Warlord Era Liu Geping was born on 8 August 1904 into a large landowning family of Muslim Hui ethnicity in Dadi East Village (), Mengcun County, Hebei Province. He also used the names Liu Zimin () and Liu Xiangnong (). In 1918 he joined the army of Li Chun, a warlord of the Zhili Clique, and entered its military school in Nanjing. The next year he participated in the May Fourth Movement as an activist. He joined the Chinese Socialist Youth League in 1922, and returned home to spread revolutionary values. Instrumental in the founding of the first socialist youth cell in the area, in December 1925 he co-led an armed peasant uprising against the Beiyang government, the first of its kind in northern China. In July 1926, Liu joined the Communist Party of China and then spearheaded a series of educational initiatives aimed at increasing the influence of the party in the Tianjin- Hebei region. After founding schools and party organizations in dozens of counties, he took part in the founding of a 300-strong \\"Southern Tianjin Revolutionary Army\\", which aimed to topple warlords and incite armed uprisings. In June 1928 he led a peasant uprising in Qingyun County, occupying the county seat and taking guns from the local police. He was arrested that year for his agitation and spent the next three years in prison. After he was released, the Communist Party sent him to Shaanxi to work for Yang Hucheng's army. Japanese invasion and Civil War After the Mukden incident and subsequent Japanese incursions into China, Liu became a founding member of the \\"Hui People Against Japanese Invasion\\" organization. In 1932 he returned home to work on military operations and to coordinate underground party activities. He was again arrested on April20, 1934, after organizing the Majia River () uprising in Qingyun. He was held in Caolanzi Prison () in Beijing, along with 61 other Communist Party leaders including Bo Yibo, An Ziwen, and Liu Lantao (no relation). To secure their release, the Communist Party Central Committee advised them to sign an announcement denouncing communism. Most complied and were released by the Kuomintang government, but Liu Geping was among the few who refused and served his full sentence. After his release in 1944, Liu took on more leadership roles within the Tianjin branch of the Communist Party. He then went to Shandong to found an organization for ethnic Hui to aid soldiers on the front lines of the Chinese Civil War. In March 1949, he went south with the People's Liberation Army to East China and served as vice-principal of the newly established East China People's Revolution University. ==People's Republic of China== Early PRC In September 1949, Liu Geping was selected as an ethnic minority representative to attend the first meeting of the Communist-led Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference; he was ranked first among minority delegates. At the founding ceremony of the People's Republic of China on 1 October 1949, he was selected to speak in Tiananmen Square as the official representative of China's minority peoples. Liu joined the government and became deputy director of the State Ethnic Affairs Commission. In this capacity Liu frequently visited western areas with high minority populations. He was a delegate to the 1st National People's Congress in 1954. After the congress, Liu and the Tibetan communist Phünwang were assigned to accompany the 14th Dalai Lama, also a delegate, on his tour of Chinese cities, which had a great impact on the Dalai Lama. In 1956, Liu was elected a member of the 8th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. In 1958, Liu began heading up the party organization of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region on an interim basis. He became the first Chairman of the autonomous region government in October 1958. Because he took a moderate approach to policies toward ethnic minorities, he was branded an \\"ethnic splittist\\" in 1960. In September he was dismissed from all of his positions and sent back to Beijing to take part in \\"rehabilitation\\" at the Central Party School. Cultural Revolution In December 1965, Liu regained favour and was named Vice-Governor of Shanxi province. At the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, having gained the support of leftist radicals in Beijing, Liu successfully overthrew his superior Wei Heng and became Chairman of the Shanxi Revolutionary Committee, the de facto top leader. Wei was imprisoned and committed suicide. Meanwhile, the Central Cultural Revolution Group, led by Kang Sheng and Jiang Qing, began to investigate the case of the 61 communist leaders who were instructed to denounce communism at Caolanzi Prison in the 1930s. The officials, notably Bo Yibo and An Ziwen, were branded as the \\"61 Renegades Clique\\" and persecuted. In contrast, Liu Geping was heralded as a hero for his refusal to sign the denunciation. He was invited to make speeches all over the country and was re-elected to the 9th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in April 1969. However, Liu had also become involved in major disputes with the military leaders in Shanxi and was engaged in factional violence in the province. He was dismissed from office in July 1969, just three months after his re-election to the Central Committee. In 1970, he was sent to perform manual labour at a pottery factory in Tangshan. He was allowed to return to Beijing in 1975. Later life After the end of the Cultural Revolution in 1976 and the pivotal 3rd Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the post-Mao Communist Party cleared Liu's name and declared that he \\"did not have any political problems.\\" In 1983, he was named a member of the National Committee of the 6th Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, a ceremonial position. Liu died in Beijing on 11 March 1992. He was given full funeral rites at the Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery. His body was taken back to his native village and buried according to Muslim Hui rituals. ==ReferencesBibliography== * * * Category:1904 births Category:1992 deaths Category:Hui people Category:Politicians from Cangzhou Category:People's Republic of China politicians from Hebei Category:Communist Party of China politicians from Hebei Category:Political office-holders in Ningxia Category:Political office- holders in Shanxi Category:People of the Cultural Revolution Category:Delegates to the 1st National People's Congress Category:Delegates to the 3rd National People's Congress ","title":"Liu Geping"},{"id":"46372912","text":"Kumbungu District is one of the twenty six (26) districts in the Northern Region of Ghana.

Museum of History in Lund, Sweden. The use of medieval runes mostly disappears in the course of the 14th century. An exception are the Dalecarlian runes, which survived, heavily influenced by the Latin alphabet, into the 19th century. Occasional use of runes also seems to have persisted elsewhere, as evidenced by the 16th-century Faroer Fámjin stone. Antiquarian interest in runes first arises in the 16th century, with the 1555 Historia de gentibus septentrionalibus by Olaus Magnus, and picks up in the 17th century, notably with Peder Resen's Edda Islandorum of 1665. In the 17th century, runology pioneer Johannes Bureus published his Runa ABC, the first Swedish alphabet book. Runic calendars are perpetual calendar based on the 19-year-long Metonic cycle of the Moon. They may originate as early as in the 13th century, but most surviving examples date to the early modern period. Most of the several thousand which survive are wooden calendars date from the 16th century onward. Around 1800, such calendars were made in the form of tobacco boxes in brass. ==Esotericism==  Germanic mysticism and völkisch symbolism  The pioneer of the Armanist branch of Ariosophy and one of the more important figures in esotericism in Germany and Austria in the late 19th and early 20th century was the Austrian occultist, mysticist, and völkisch author, Guido von List. In 1908, he published in Das Geheimnis der Runen (\\"The Secret of the Runes\\") a set of eighteen so-called \\"Armanen runes\\", based on the Younger Futhark and runes of List's own introduction, which allegedly were revealed to him in a state of temporary blindness after cataract operations on both eyes in 1902. Circular arrangement of the Armanen runes. List's row is based on the Younger Futhark, with the names and sound values mostly close to the Anglo-Saxon Futhorc. The two final runes, Eh and Gibor, added to the Younger Futhark inventory, are taken from Anglo-Saxon Eoh and Gyfu. Apart from the two additional runes, and a displacement of the Man rune from 13th to 15th place, the sequence is identical to that of the Younger Futhark. In his English translation of the work, Stephen Flowers insists that the final h in the name futharkh is not a misspelling, but indicates the seventh rune, Hagal. The first sixteen of von List's runes correspond to the sixteen Younger Futhark runes, with slight modifications in names (and partly mirrored shapes). The two additional runes are loosely inspired by the Anglo-Saxon Futhorc. The first sixteen are named Fa, Ur, Thurs, Os, Rit, Ka, Hagal, Nauth, Is, Ar, Sig, Tyr, Bar, Laf, Man, Yr. The final two are Eh (the name is from Anglo-Saxon Futhork, the shape like Younger Futhark Ar) and Gibor (the name similar to Anglo-Saxon Futhork Gyfu, but in shape similar to a Wolfsangel symbol). Karl Maria Wiligut in 1934 developed a rune row loosely based on List's Armanen runes, even though Wiligut rejected List's runes and his overall philosophy. Wiligut claimed to have been initiated into \\"runic lore\\" by his grandfather Karl Wiligut (1794–1883). His rune row has 24 letters, like the Elder Futhark. Like von List's Armanen runes that are closely based on the Younger Futhark, many of Wiligut's runes are identical to historical runes, with some additions. The historical Futhark sequence is not preserved.Widar, Jarl – Whispering of Gotos – Rune-Knowledge [from Hagal 11 (1934), Heft 7, pp. 7–15]. Flowers, Dr. Stephen E. and Moynihan, Michael – The Secret King (2001) Wiligut's names for his runes are: Tel, Man, Kaun, Fa, Asa, Os, Eis, Not, Tor, Tyr, Laf, Rit, Thorn, Ur, Sig, Zil, Yr, Hag-Al, H, Wend-horn, Gibor, Eh, Othil, Bar-Bjork. Runes without direct precedent in the historical runes are Tel (a crossed ring, similar to the sun cross symbol), Tor (like a Latin T), Zil (like a rotated Latin Z), Gibor (taken from von List's runes). The shape of Wend-horn is similar to Tvimadur. The use of runes in Germanic mysticism, notably List's \\"Armanen runes\\" and the derived \\"Wiligut runes\\" played a certain role in Nazi symbolism. The fascination with runic symbolism was mostly limited to Heinrich Himmler, and not shared by the other members of the Nazi top echelon. Consequently, runes appear mostly in insignia associated with the Schutzstaffel, the paramilitary organization led by Himmler. Wiligut is credited with designing the SS-Ehrenring, which displays a number of \\"Wiligut runes\\". Contemporary esotericism and neopaganism  In German esotericism after 1945, List's Armanen runes became somewhat detached from its völkisch associations and became part of general \\"pansophical\\" or eclectic occultism, notably due to the publications by Karl Spiesberger. During the New Age boom of the 1980s, the Armanen runes may well have been more popularly known in Germany than the historical runes.\\"The personal force of List and that of his extensive and influential Armanen Orden was able to shape the runic theories of German magicians...from that time to the present day. [...] the Armanen system of runes...by 1955 had become almost 'traditional' in German circles\\" Flowers 1984: 15-16. From the 1970s, a revival of interest in the historical runes developed in the emerging movements associated with Germanic neopaganism, and to a lesser extent in other forms of Neopaganism and New Age esotericism. Various systems of Runic divination have been published since the 1980s, notably by Ralph Blum (1982), Stephen Flowers (1984, onward), Stephan Grundy (1990), and Nigel Pennick (1995). The Uthark theory, originally proposed as a scholarly hypothesis by Sigurd Agrell in 1932, was received in runic esotericism via Kenneth Meadows' Rune Power (1995) and Thomas Karlsson's Uthark: Nightside of the Runes (2002). ==Runestones== Runic script on an 1886 gravestone in Parkend, England. The inscription reads, \\"ᛋᛆᚴᚱᛁᛏ ᛏᚮ\\". A number of notable runestones of modern origin exist. Some of them are intended as hoaxes, their creators attempting to imitate a Viking Age artefact. This mostly concerns the American runestones, such as the Kensington runestone or the Oklahoma runestones. Especially since the late 20th century, runestones in the style of the Viking Age were also made without pretense of authenticity, either as independent works of art or as replicas as museum exhibits or tourist attractions.\\"In December 1997 I moved to Adelsö, the Island there the kings lived in the viking period, near the Island of Birka [...] My capabilities to live on my handicraft became bigger and I extend with guided tours in the ancient area, protected by UNESCO. On a piece of land, near this area, I build up my place of work and exhibition. [...] The year 2000 I got honored to carve a runestone as a memory of Leif Eriksson who did the exploration of North America, thousand year ago. The runestone was carved here at Adelsö. When the work was completed, the stone transferred to Canada and became raised at the northern point of Newfoundland / Vineland.\\" (Kalle Dahlberg, runstonecarver.com) \\"The three types of contemporary runestone carvings highlighted in the article are those that are \\"exact copies of existing stones\\", \\"explicitly contemporary\\", and \\"new, but with Old Norse\\".\\" (ireadrunes.blogspot.com 2012) ==J. R. R. Tolkien== In J. R. R. Tolkien's novel The Hobbit (1937), the Anglo-Saxon runes are used on a map to emphasize its connection to the Dwarves. They also were used in the initial drafts of The Lord of the Rings, but later were replaced by the Cirth rune-like alphabet invented by Tolkien. Tolkien's mode of writing Modern English in Anglo-Saxon runes received explicit recognition with the introduction of three extra runes to the Unicode Runic block used by him in Unicode version 7.0 (2014). The three characters represent the English k, oo and sh graphemes, as follows: *RUNIC LETTER K (, U+16F1), a variant of cen historically attested in the Westeremden yew-stick inscription (and there mostly interpreted as representing /k/); the Anglo-Saxon runes do have a k rune in manuscript tradition, called calc (), but Tolkien has used its shape to represent the letter z. *RUNIC LETTER SH (, U+16F2), a mirrored variant of the s rune *RUNIC LETTER OO (, U+16F3), similar to the \\"lantern rune\\" or ger The k rune was published with The Hobbit (1937), e.g. for writing Tolkien's own name, as . His oo and sh runes are known from a postcard written to Katherine Farrer on 30 November 1947, published as no. 112 in The Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien (1981).\\"A postcard, apparently written on 30 November 1947, using the system of runes employed in The Hobbit [...] Mrs Farrer, a writer of detective stories, was married to the theologian Austin Farrer, then Chaplain of Trinity College, Oxford.\\" Michael Everson and Andrew West,\\"Proposal to encode additional Runic characters in the UCS\\", ISO/IEC JTC1/SC2/WG2 N4013R, 10 May 2011 (the name is mistakenly given as Ferrer by Everson and West). Tolkien's mode for writing Modern English is mostly based on orthography, transcribing each letter, with a few special runes used for frequent digraphs, as follows: \\"The writing mode Tolkien's writing mode is mainly orthographic. It has one rune for each letter, regardless of pronunciation, except for a few sounds that are written with the same rune regardless of the letter. The letters that are subject to this phonemic spelling are A and O. In addition, some letter bigrams representing certain sounds are written with a single rune.\\" Per Lindberg, Tolkien's English Runes (2012). Examples from The Hobbit and The Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien are reproduced for convenience of reference by Everson and West (2011). { - grapheme  a b c d e ea  ee  eo  f g h i, j  k l m n ng  o oa oo  p qu  r s sh  st  t th  u, v w x y  z - rune  The letter a is either consistently transcribed as æsc or transcribed as or depending on pronunciation /æ/, /a/ or /o/, respectively. Lindberg (2012), p. 2.       Tolkien apparently uses a Z-shaped variant of the ēoh rune to represent the eo digraph in the name George [Allan & Unwin] , written as ᚷᛇᚱᚷᛖ in the Hobbit title page.             the Anglo-Saxon runes in manuscript tradition do have a rune for the qu phoneme, cweorð , but Tolkien does not seem to have used it, preferring the digraph cw instead.    used in the Farrer letter, while the published inscriptions rendered sh simply as the digraph .      ,   } ==References== ","title":"Modern runic writing"},{"id":"46372950","text":"Halifax Tool Library (HTL) is a tool lending library based in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.

Breaux (February 6, 1880 - October 31, 1956) was an American music instructor and musician who played the trumpet, violin and piano. She organized the first music department at Langston University in Oklahoma and the school's first orchestra. As the Supervisor of Music for the segregated African American schools in Oklahoma City, Breaux organized bands, choral groups and orchestras, establishing a music teacher in each school in the district. She had a wide influence on many musicians including Charlie Christian and Jimmy Rushing, as well as novelist Ralph Ellison. Breaux was the first woman president of the Oklahoma Association of Negro Teachers and was posthumously inducted into the Oklahoma YWCA Hall of Fame, Oklahoma Women's Hall of Fame and the Oklahoma Bandmasters Association Hall of Fame. The Oklahoma City/County Historical Society made a posthumous presentation of its Pathmaker Award to Breaux in 2017. ==Biography== Zelia N. Page was born on 6 February 1880 in Jefferson City, Missouri to Inman Edward and Zelia Ball Page. She earned a bachelor's degree in music from the Lincoln Institute, where her father was serving as principal. When her father accepted the presidency of the Colored Agricultural and Normal University (now Langston University) on 1 May 1898, he offered her a job as a music teacher and she relocated to Oklahoma Territory. Page established the school's music department and taught piano and instrumental music. In 1902, she organized the first orchestra at Langston which began with seven musicians and two years later had grown to 23 students. She established the choral society, a glee club and the school band, requiring students to study classical music. Marriage and family On 6 December 1905, Page married Armogen Breaux (9 August 1870 – 9 December 1958). The couple had one son, Inman A. Breaux (4 October 1908 – 24 November 1967), who was a Professor of Education, an Administrative Dean, and Dean of Student Affairs at Langston University. Oklahoma City years In 1918, Breaux left Langston and accepted the position as Supervisor of Music for the segregated African American schools in Oklahoma City. She established a music teacher in each grade school in the district, organized the Oklahoma City Community Band, and headed the music department at Douglass High School. While at Douglass, she organized a twenty-four-voice chorus, an eighteen-piece symphony orchestra, and several glee clubs. At this time, it was unusual for black schools to offer music training beyond voice instruction, but Breaux believed that the discipline and instruction of classical music served as a catalyst for elevating and mastering life. Breaux believed in her independence. She lived in Oklahoma City and taught, managed the Aldridge theater and rental properties, commuting back and forth to Langston, where her husband lived. She hired a live-in cook to prepare her meals. She was a talented musician and played the trumpet, violin and piano. Breaux discouraged her students playing jazz, instructing them in classical music and music theory but she owned the only black theater in Oklahoma City and often hired blues and jazz musicians to play at her Aldridge Theater. Count Basie, Gonzelle White and King Oliver's bands all played there, as well as Ida Cox, Ma Rainey, Bessie Smith and Mamie Smith. The Douglass High School band, which she organized in 1923 with twenty- five participants, was renowned throughout the United States. The students, who were both junior and senior high musicians, became minor celebrities. Through their national appearances, the band influenced a wide range of musicians including Eubie Blake, Charlie Christian, Duke Ellington, Jimmy Rushing, Noble Sissle, and Sherman Sneed.

A midfielder, tall and weighing , vandenBerg has the ability to contribute as both an inside and outside midfielder, whilst also pushing into the forward line. After missing out on the draft at eighteen years of age, vandenBerg played in the North East Australian Football League (NEAFL) with the Ainslie Football Club where he won two best and fairest awards and was twice named in the NEAFL team of the year. His performances in the NEAFL saw him recruited by the Melbourne Football Club with the second selection in the 2015 rookie draft and he made his AFL debut in the opening round of the 2015 season. ==Early life== Originally from Western Australia, vandenBerg moved to Tathra, New South Wales with his family at ten-years of age. He was first noticed as a potential AFL player in 2007 by then- recruiter, Jason Taylor, however he was not drafted due to lacking \\"the drive to be an AFL footballer.\\" He moved to Canberra in 2011 to join in the North East Australian Football League (NEAFL), where he won the eastern conference premiership in his first year, and back-to-back Hibberson Cup Trophies as the club best and fairest player in 2013 and 2014. In addition, he was named in the NEAFL team of the year on the wing and as the ruck rover in 2013 and 2014 respectively. During 2014, he amassed fifty-six disposals in a match against Eastlake, which contributed to him being recognised as a high-disposal winner and put him back on the AFL radar. Then at , Jason Taylor and the club decided to recruit him in December 2014. Whilst living in Canberra, he was completing a four-year apprenticeship at the Royal Australian Mint, but ended it after two and a half years to move to Melbourne. ==AFL career== vandenBerg in February 2017 vandenBerg was drafted by the Melbourne Football Club with their first selection and second overall in the 2015 rookie draft. After a shoulder reconstruction at the end of 2014, Melbourne football operations manager, Josh Mahoney, stated vandenBerg was \\"exceeding expectations\\" and he made his debut in the 2015 opening round, twenty-six point win against at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. He was named in the best players for Melbourne and recorded seventeen disposals, four marks and a goal. Lauded for his tenacity and ability to win the contested ball, he played the first ten matches of the year before suffering a hamstring strain in the annual Queen's Birthday clash against . He returned to the side in round fifteen against , and played the next four matches before injuring his ankle in August, he was then ruled out for the rest of the season after playing fourteen matches in his debut season. After signing a contract extension until the end of the 2017 season, he was promoted from the rookie list to the senior list for the 2016 season onward. Despite suffering from an ankle injury during the 2016 pre-season, vandenBerg played the start of the season in the senior side. He played in the first three matches of the season before re-aggravating his ankle injury, and he was forced to miss a month of football. He made his return to football in the Victorian Football League (VFL), playing for Melbourne's affiliate team, the Casey Scorpions. He returned to the senior side for the eighteen point loss against at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in round eleven. He played the next five matches before missing the round eighteen match against at Domain Stadium due to a hip injury. He returned the next week for the two point win against Gold Coast at the Melbourne Cricket Ground where he kicked a career high three goals and was named in Melbourne's best.

There are various types of microscopy that use quantum principles. The first microscope to make use of quantum concepts was the scanning tunneling microscope, which paved the way for development of the photoionization microscope and the quantum entanglement microscope. == Scanning tunnelling microscope == The scanning tunnelling microscope (STM) uses the concept of quantum tunnelling to directly image atoms of a sample. The STM can be used to study the three- dimensional structure of a sample, by scanning the surface with a sharp metal conducting tip at an extremely small distance. Such an environment is conducive to quantum tunnelling: a quantum mechanical effect that occurs when electrons move through a barrier due to their wave-like properties. Tunnelling depends on the thickness of the barrier. If the barrier is reasonably thin, the probability function predicts some electrons will pass to the other side. This will create a current across the tunnel. The number of electrons that will tunnel is dependent on the thickness of the barrier, therefore the current through the barrier will also depend on the thickness. In this case, the distance between the sharp metal tip and the surface of the sample will affect the current measured by the tip. The tip is formed by one single atom, and it slowly scans across the surface at a distance of an atom's diameter. By paying attention to the current, the distance can be kept more or less constant, allowing the tip to move up and down according to the structure of the sample. The STM is able to follow even the smallest details. The STM works best with conducting materials in order to create a current. However, since its creation, various implementations have been created that allow for a larger variety of samples, such as the spin polarized scanning tunneling microscopy (SPSTM), and the atomic force microscopy (AFM). ==Photoionization microscopy== The wave function is central to the theory of Quantum Mechanics. It contains the maximum information that can be known about the quantum state of that particle. The square of the wave function describes the probability of where exactly a particle might be located at any given moment. Direct imaging of a wave function used to be considered only a gedanken experiment- however, due to recent microscopy developments, it is now possible to be accomplished. An image of an atom's exact position or the movement of its electrons is almost impossible to measure because any direct observation of an atom disturbs its quantum coherence. As such, observing an atom's wave function and getting an image of its full quantum state requires many direct measurements to be made over time, which are then statistically averaged. One such tool recently developed to directly visualize atomic structure and quantum states is the photoionization microscope. A photoionization microscope is an instrument that uses photoionization, along with quantum properties and principles, in order to measure atomic properties. The principle behind photoionization microscopy is to study the spatial distribution of electrons ejected from an atom in a situation in which the De Broglie wavelength becomes large enough to be observed on a macroscopic scale. In photoionization microscopy experiments, an atom in an electric field is ionized by a laser with sharply defined frequency, the electron is drawn toward a position- sensitive detector, and the current is measured as a function of position. The application of an electric field during photoionization allows confining the electron flux along one coordinate. Multiple classical paths lead from the atom to any point in the classically allowed region on the detector, and waves travelling along these paths produce an interference pattern. There is an infinite set of different families of trajectories, leading to an extremely complicated interference pattern on the detector. As such, photoionization microscopy relies on the existence of interferences between various trajectories by which the electron moves from the atom to the plane of observation, for example, photoionization microscopy of the hydrogen atom in parallel electric and magnetic fields.  History and development  The idea for a photoionization microscope that could image the wave-function of an atom stemmed out of an experiment proposed by Demkov and colleagues in the early 1980s. The researchers suggested that electron waves could be imaged when interacting with a static electric field as long as the de Broglie Wavelength of these electrons was large enough. It was not until 1996 that anything resembling the microscopy images proposed by Demkov and colleagues came to fruition. In 1996 a team of French researchers developed the first photodetachment microscope. The development of this microscope allowed for a direct observation of the oscillatory structure of a wave function to become possible. Photodetachment is the removal of electrons from an atom using interactions with photons or other particles. Photodetachment microscopy made it possible to image the spatial distribution of the ejected electron. The microscope developed in 1996 was the first to image photodetachment rings of a negative Bromine (Br-) ion. These images revealed interference between two electron waves on their way to the detector. The first attempts to use photoionization microscopy were performed on atoms of Xenon (Xe) by a team of Dutch researchers in 2001. Photoionization in the presence of an electric field allows the quantum nature of the wavefunction of an electron to be observed in the macroscopic world . The differences between direct and indirect ionization create different trajectories for the outgoing electron to follow. Direct ionization corresponds to electrons ejected down-field towards the bottleneck in the Coulomb + dc electric field potential, whereas indirect ionization corresponds to electrons ejected away from the bottleneck in the Coulomb + dc electric field and only ionize upon further Coulomb interactions. The different trajectories caused by direct and indirect ionization give rise to a distinct pattern that can be detected by a two-dimensional flux detector and subsequently imaged. The images exhibited an outer ring, which corresponded to the indirect ionization process and an inner ring, which corresponded to the direct ionization process. This oscillatory pattern can be interpreted as being interferences among the trajectories of the electrons moving from the atom to the detector. The next group to attempt photoionization microscopy used the excitation of Lithium atoms in the presence of a static electric field. This experiment was the first to reveal evidence of quasibound states. A quasi bound state has been defined as a \\"state having a connectedness to true bound state through the variation of some physical parameter\\". This was done by photoionizing the Lithium atoms in the presence of a ≈1 kV/cm static electric field. This experiment was an important precursor to the imaging of the hydrogen wave function because, contrary to the experiments done with Xenon, the Lithium wave function microscopy images are sensitive to the presence of resonances. Therefore, the quasi bound states were directly revealed. The success of this experiment led researchers to attempt to microscopy of the hydrogen atom's wave function. In 2013, Aneta Stodolna and colleagues imaged the hydrogen atom's wave function by measuring an interference pattern on a 2D detector. The electrons are excited to their Rydberg state. In this state, the electron orbital is far from the centre nucleus. The Rydberg electron is in a dc field, which causes it to be above the classical ionization threshold, but below the field-free ionization energy. The electron wave ends up producing an interference pattern because the portion of the wave directed towards the 2D detector interferes with the portion directed away from the detector. This interference pattern shows a number of nodes that is consistent with the nodal structure of the Hydrogen atom orbital  Future directions and applications of photoionization microscopy  The same team of researchers that imaged the Hydrogen electron's wave function are now embarking on imaging the Helium (He) atom. They report that there are considerable differences since Helium has two electrons and that imaging of these electrons may actually enable them to 'see' entanglement. Further studies that remain to be undertaken include examining to what extent photoionization microscopy allows the construction of an atomic-size interferometer. If accomplished, this would enable the direct observation of the influence of an external source of deviation from the system, such as the presence of a magnetic field or neighbouring ions. == Quantum entanglement microscope (Entanglement-enhanced microscope) == Quantum metrology involves using quantum mechanics to make precise measurement that cannot be achieved classically. Typically, entanglement of N particles are used to measure a phase with a precision ∆φ = 1/N. called the Heisenberg limit. This exceeds the ∆φ = 1/ precision limit possible with N non-entangled particles, called the standard quantum limit (SQL). The signal-to-noise ratio for a given light intensity is limited by the standard quantum limit, which is critical for measurements where the probe light intensity is limited in order to avoid damaging the sample. The standard quantum limit can be tackled using quantum entangled particles. Researchers developed a microscope that uses quantum entanglement to increase its sensitivity. The experimentation of the microscope involved imaging a pattern carved in relief on the surface of a glass plate. In one of these works, the pattern was only 17 nanometers higher than the plate, which can be difficult to resolve when using typical microscopy apparatuses. Quantum entanglement microscopes are a form of confocal-type differential interference contrast microscope. Entangled photon pairs and more generally, NOON states are used as the source of illumination. Two beams of photons are beamed at two adjacent spots on the flat-surfaced sample. The interference pattern of the beams are measured after they are reflected. When the two beams hit the flat surface, they both travel the same length and produce a corresponding interference pattern. This interference pattern changes when the beams hit portion on the glass surface that are of a different height. The shape of the patterns can be resolved by analysing the interference pattern and phase difference. A standard optical microscope would be very unlikely to detect something so small. The difference when measured with entangled photons is precise, as one entangled photon gives information about the other. Therefore, they provide more information than independent photons, creating sharper images.  Future directions and applications of quantum entangled-enhanced microscopy  Entanglement-enhancement principles can be used to vastly improve the image provided by microscopes. By enhancing with quantum entanglement, researchers are able to overcome the Rayleigh criterion. This is ideal for studying biological tissues and materials that are opaque. However, a limitation is that the light intensity is lowered in order to avoid damaging the sample. Further, the use of entangled microscopy can avoid the phototoxicity and photobleaching that comes with two-photon scanning fluorescence microscopy. In addition, since the interaction region within entangled microscopy is controlled by two beams, the selection of where to image is extremely flexible, which provides enhanced axial and lateral resolution In addition to the sampling of biological tissues, high-precision optical phase measurements have additional applications such as gravitational wave detection, measurements of material properties, as well as medical and biological sensing. ==Quantum enhanced super-resolution in fluorescence microscopy== In a fluorescence microscope, images of objects that contains fluorescent particles are recorded. Each such particle can emit not more than one photon at a time, a quantum-mechanical effect known as photon antibunching. Recording anti-bunching in fluorescence image provides additional information that can be used to enhance the microscope's resolution over the diffraction limit, and was demonstrated for several different types of fluorescent particles. Intuitively, antibunching can be thought of as detection of ‘missing’ events of two photons emitted from every particle that cannot simultaneously emit two photons. It is therefore used to produce an image like one that would have been produced using photons with half the wavelength of the detected photons. By detecting N-photon events, the resolution can be improved by up to a factor of N over the diffraction limit. In conventional fluorescence microscopes, antibunching information is often ignored, as simultaneous detection of multiple photon emission requires temporal resolution higher than that of most commonly available cameras. However, recent developments in detector technology has already enabled first demonstrations of quantum enhanced super-resolution using fast detector arrays, such as single-photon avalanche diode arrays. == References  External links == * http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2013/may/23/quantum-microscope-peers- into-the-hydrogen-atom * https://physics.aps.org/articles/v6/58 Category:Quantum mechanics Category:Microscopes ","title":"Quantum microscopy"},{"id":"46373059","text":"Taichung Japanese School is a Japanese international school in Daya District, Taichung, Taiwan in the Republic of China.Home page.

It consists of a high- loaded A-stage and low-loaded B-stage. The process is operated without a primary clarifier, with the A-stage being an open dynamic biological system. Both stages have separate settling tanks and sludge recycling lines, thus maintaining unique microbial communities in both reactors. ==History== Adsorption/bio-oxidation process was invented in the mid-1970s by the professor of the RWTH Aachen University Botho Böhnke. It was based on the finding, made by the German engineer Karl Imhoff in the 50th. Imhoff stated that the treatment efficiency of 60-80 percent could be achieved in highly loaded activated sludge basins. In 1977 Böhnke published his first article on adsorption/bio-oxidation process.Böhnke B. (1977). Das Adsorptions- Belebungsverfahren. Korrespondenz Abwasser, 24. Jahrg., 2/77 The same year the patent was issued. Extensive research of the following years, conducted by prof. Böhnke together with Bernd and Andreas Diering, ended up in 1985 with the establishment of the company Dr.-Ing. Bernd Diering GmbH. The same year AB-process was for the first time applied in a full-scale at the Krefeld, Germany sewage treatment plant (800 000 P.E.). In 1990, 19 full scale installations existed in Western Germany alone. Further application of the process in Europe was hindered by the tightening of the effluent discharge requirements with respect to nitrogen and phosphorus. The process came into notice in 2000th again due to the increased interest in energy recovery from wastewater. ==Principle of operation== The A-stage, or adsorption stage is the most innovative component of the process. It is not preceded by primary treatment. Simple schematic description of the adsorption/bio-oxidation process Influent organic matter is removed in the A-stage mainly by flocculation and sorption to sludge due to the high loading rates (2-10 g BOD • g VSS−1 • d−1) and low sludge age (typically 4-10 h). Hydrolysis of complex organic molecules occurs improving biodegradability of the influent of the B-stage. High loading rates and low sludge age favours development of dynamic biocoenosis with a large fraction of microorganisms present in the exponential growth phase. Diverse sludge biocoenosis increase variety of organic compounds that can be degraded in the A-stage and makes the process more stable towards the shock loads. Altogether, up to 80% of the influent organic matter can be removed in the A-stage. The required reactor volume and oxygen supply are lower if compared to the removal in the conventional activated sludge process. The B-stage, or bio-oxidation stage, is a typical low-loaded activated sludge process, where biodegradation of the remaining organic material occurs. The B-stage can be designed for nitrogen and/or phosphorus removal by alternating aerobic, anoxic and anaerobic zones in the reactor. Typical operational conditions of the adsorption/bio-oxidation process {  - ! Parameter !! A-stage !! B-stage -  Loading rate, g BOD • g VSS−1 • d−1  2 - 10  0.05 - 0.3 -  HRT, h  0.5  2 - 4 -  MLSS, g/l  1.5 - 2  3 - 4 -  SRT, d  0.2 - 0.5 15 - 20 -  Dissolved oxygen, mg/l  0.2 - 0.7  0.7 - 1.5 } Advantages of the process * Lower aeration requirements decrease energy consumption and aeration costs for 20 percent if compared with conventional single stage activated sludge plant.Technologies that Transform. Pollutants into Innocuous Components. www.eolss.net * The volumes of aeration tanks are 40% lower if compared with conventional single stage activated sludge plant. * Increased sludge production in the A-stage results in increased biogas production in the digester (for plants with anaerobic digestion of excess sludge).Energy efficiency in the European water industry . Stowa report #2010-44 * Stability towards the shock loads (pH, chemical oxygen demand (COD), toxic substances) explained by the wide-ranging biochemical potential, high mutation capacity and adaptability of sludge in the A-stage.Boehnke, B., Diering, B., & Zuckut, S. W. (1997). AB process removes organics and nutrients. Water Environment and Technology, 9(3), 23-27. * A-stage can receive higher organic loads than conventional activated sludge systems. * Effluent concentrations are more stable because of the two-stage process configuration employed. * Heavy metals are mainly removed with the A-stage sludge. Therefore, B-stage sludge has lower concentrations of heavy metals than sludge from conventional activated sludge process and may comply with the agricultural standards.Wang, J.-L., Zhang, J.-T., Chen, X.,\`Yi, H.-X. (2011). Characteristics of heavy-metal translating in adsorption and biodegradation activated sludge process. International Conference on Electric Technology and Civil Engineering, ICETCE 2011 - Proceedings. Drawbacks of the process * Incomplete denitrification is often observed in the B-stage if the influent C/N ratio is low. Direct by-pass of a part of A-stage influent with high organic matter content to the B-stage is used to increase the C/N ratio. * High sludge production in the A-stage is a drawback for WWTPs that are not equipped with anaerobic digestion of sludge because it increases sludge treatment costs. * Sludge from A-stage has poor settling properties. * High retention times cause an increased need for additional reactors to maintain throughput increasing equipment costs ==Nutrient removal== Nitrogen removal in the A-stage can reach 30-40%, as nitrogen of organic compounds is incorporated in upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor sludge. The sludge age of the B-stage is typically between 8 and 20 days promoting the growth of nitrifiers. Therefore, complete nitrification is usually achieved in the B-stage. Complete denitrification is difficult to achieve, because of the low C:N ratio in the influent of the B-stage. Insufficient carbon supply of carbon source to the B-stage occurs due to the high efficiency of organic matter removal in the A-stage. The problem can be solved by decreasing organic matter removal in the A-stage, external carbon source supply, intermittent aeration or decreased HRT of the A-stage and/or on-line control of certain operational parameters.Wenyi, D., Hong, D., Li-an, Z., Jia, M., Baozhen, W. (2006). Operational retrofits of AB process for biological removal of nitrogen and phosphorus. Water Practice & Technology, 1 (4) doi: 10.2166/WPT.2006078 To achieve biological nitrogen and phosphorus removal anaerobic and anoxic compartments are introduced before the aerated zone of the B-stage. Phosphorus removal from the secondary effluent of the B-stage can be achieved by coagulation with ferric and aluminium salts, e.g. FeCl3 or Al2(SO4)3.Xie, J.-L., Shen, X., Peng, Z., Wang, Q. (2011).

As the walls and roof of the tunnel collapsed hundreds of other miners were injured. Yates with his colleagues Richard Darker, Oliver Soulsby and Frank Sykes, went to the area of the explosion and without regard to the dangers they extricated the injured miners and moved them to safety, this involved carrying them two miles underground to the main shaft, they were under constant danger of more explosions. Eight miners who were involved in the rescue were awarded the Edward Medal, including Yates and his three colleagues and members of the colliery rescue team. Yates was also awarded the Order of Industrial Heroism. After the Bentley Colliery disaster he left the coal industry to be a foundry worker until he retired. He exchanged his Edward Medal for the George Cross in 1971 when the Edward Medal was withdrawn. Yates retired to South Yorkshire with his wife and two children and in 1987 he became the last survivor of those awarded the George Cross in the disaster.

It is funded by a wide range of foundations, local and national media institutions, multinational corporations, and individuals from all over the world. The Institute was founded in 1961 and its fellowship program started in the same year. To date, the WPI has brought more than 550 international journalists to the United States. Currently, the program is hosted in conjunction with the University of St. Thomas in Saint Paul, MN. The two-month program gives international journalists the opportunity to immerse themselves in American culture, explore issues that affect global journalism and gain a fresh understanding of their profession through a demanding schedule of meetings, briefings and travel. ==History== The World Press Institute was founded in 1961 by journalist Harry W. Morgan (19342007). Fellows were originally hosted at Macalester College in Saint Paul, Minnesota, where Morgan served as director of the institution's International Center. The program originally saw international journalists spend a year in America under the auspices of the WPI, including one six-month semester at Macalester College, during which fellows lived in dorms or with host families while studying American history, politics, culture and journalism. Another three months were spent working at a large American news organization. The program ended with a graduation dinner at Macalester and inauguration into the college's Omega Upsilon Tau (OUT) fraternity. In 2007, the WPI was forced to end the program because of financial difficulties and it severed ties with Macalester College. In 2008, the Institute was revived with new funding and leadership under current Executive Director, David McDonald. A shorter program of eight to nine weeks was introduced. ==Today== According to the World Press Institute, their mission statement is: \\"To promote and strengthen press freedom throughout the world.\\" The criteria for eligibility requires applicants to have completed at least five years of full-time employment in print, broadcast or online journalism. The successful applicants must be currently employed as a non-U.S. journalist, working outside of the United States. WPI fellows begin their two-month fellowship with seminars on various subjects, including ethics, investigative reporting and social media at the University of St. Thomas. Journalists live at the university for three weeks, before embarking on a five-week tour of U.S. newsrooms, institutions and cities that spans several states. Fellows return to St. Thomas for a final week of meetings, briefings and seminars before attending a graduation ceremony. By 2014, WPI had over 500 alumni from 94 different countries. ==Alumni== * Andrés Oppenheimer (1977) * Audronius Ažubalis (1990) * Ben Antao (1967) * (1965) * (1990) * D. Shelton A.

From Jeffersonville, branch lines were started towards Columbus to the northeast and Cincinnati to the southwest, but never completed. By September 1893, the Ohio Southern had reached north to Lima with a bridge over the Great Miami River at Quincy. At Lima, the freight could link to the Lima Northern Railway for points further north. In 1898, the Lima Northern became the Detroit and Lima Northern Railroad (D&LN;). Ohio Southern depots continue to stand in St. Johns, Uniopolis, Jackson Center, Quincy, and Rosewood. thumb ==History== Planned as a narrow gauge railroad from the southeastern Ohio mineral lands connecting to Springfield, Fort Wayne and on to Chicago, the Ohio Southern Railroad never left the state of Ohio until it was taken over by the Detroit, Toledo & Ironton (DTI), serving the automobile industry in Detroit, Michigan. Originating as the Springfield, Jackson & Pomeroy Railroad on December 17, 1874 as a means to link the three towns incorporated in its name. The Dayton & South Eastern (D&SE;) had been incorporated earlier to provide the same linkages, by a circuitous route, avoiding the large hills on a more direct alignment. The townspeople of Springfield did not wish to be a branch line, so joining with the other towns missed by the D&SE; the SJ&P; was born. Both lines were intended to be an outlet for the coal deposits of Jackson and Wellston. Construction began on the SJ&P; from Jackson on December 7, 1876. The necessary $800,000 in capital had taken two years to raise. A second construction effort began on March 26, 1877 from Springfield. Until July of that year, the line operated as two routes. In June of the following year a branch line to Eureka was completed. Numerous coal mine spurs were constructed. In 1879, the Springfield, Jackson & Pomeroy was sold at a sheriff’s sale to Oliver S. Kelly. Kelly with a group of ten formed the Springfield Southern Railroad Co on November 3, 1879. The plan to extend the line to Rockwood in Lawrence County was never realized, but the SSR did convert the line to standard gauge. On May 23, 1881, the Spring Southern became the Ohio Southern Railroad Company. The company began to make some money at this time. The Ohio Southern was leased by the Indiana, Bloomington & Western Railroad (IB&W;), which was building east from Indianapolis to Springfield, and the Chesapeake & Ohio (C&O;) building westward from Springfield. The IB&W; later became the Peoria & Eastern. IB&W; control of the Ohio Southern ended in April 1892. In December 1892, the OS began extending its mainline north from Springfield to Lima, creating a longer single haul roadway. It was completed in December 1893. In 1894, a spur was established to Wellston, plus several to coal mines. On May 9, 1895, the Ohio Southern was forced into receivership due to the financial strain caused by the Lima extension. A group of bondholders purchased the property on October 15, 1898. The Ohio Southern ceased to operate as an independent railroad. Extension to Ironton On February 11, 1848, a Special Act of the Ohio General Assembly authorized the incorporation of the Iron Railroad Company, and during 1849-50 a six-mile line was built from Ironton to the Vesuvius Tunnel Mines. It was extended in 1853 to Center Station. By 1858, though, the structure spanning Sterrns Creek north of Ironton was considered too weak to carry increased loads and a wrought iron truss, patented by W. H. Moseley and fabricated in Cincinnati, was erected over the stream. This wrought-iron bridge remained in service until 1924, when it was removed and placed on exhibition in the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan, some years later. ==Cincinnati, Columbus & Hocking Valley Railroad.== From November 28, 1883, until May 31, 1884, the Ohio Southern operated a small railroad, the Cincinnati, Columbus & Hocking Valley. The CC&HV; extended from Jeffersonville with the Ohio Southern west to Claysville Junction on the Little Miami Railroad's Cincinnati-Xenia main line. Organized on December 9, 1875 as the Waynesville, Port William & Jeffersonville Railroad Co. The owners were among group of ten involved with the Springfield, Jackson & Pomoroy. The CC&HV; completed 15 miles from Jeffersonville to Port William by October 1877, and the following month was reorganized as the Columbus, Washington & Cincinnati Railroad Co. By 1887, the W&C; was abandoned and tracks removed. In March 1884, the Ohio Southern purchased a portion of the roadbed for a Cincinnati-Columbus line. Built from Sedalia through Jeffersonville and on to Kingman, the line was never finished and it was abandoned in several stages from 1931 and 1941. The Detroit & Lima Northern (D&LN;) was planning a line from Columbus to Fort Wayne, Indiana, the Columbus Northwestern Railway, (CNW) incorporated in August 1897. The CNW constructed a small portion of a line Columbus Junction (later named Salter's) to Peoria in August 1898. The Detroit & Lima Northern finished a link from Columbus Junction to St. Mary's by November 1 of that year. Then the D&LN; leased from the Ohio Southern the Lima to Columbus Junction link to the CNW. The bondholders who had purchased the Ohio Southern in 1989 refused to renew this lease. On December 1, 1900 the D&LN; ended its financial affiliation with the Columbus Northwestern and ended service into Columbus over the Toledo and Ohio Central Railway. The Columbus Northwestern later was to become a portion of the T&OC; system. ==Merger== In 1901, the Ohio Southern Railway merged with the Detroit and Lima Northern Railway and formed the Detroit Southern Railroad. This company was purchased at foreclosure on May 1, 1905 by Harry B. Hollins & Company of New York, which reincorporated it in the state of Michigan under the name of the Detroit, Toledo and Ironton Railway. ==Stations== The Ohio Southern operated a single mainline in Ohio from Lima to Ironton.

The tunnel runs from the northern end of Wipkingen station to a portal to the south of Oerlikon station. It carries twin standard gauge () tracks electrified at 15 kV AC 16 2/3 Hz using overhead catenary. Since 1902, the line has been part of the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB). The tunnel was opened in 1856 to complete the Schweizerische Nordostbahn (NOB) line from Zürich Hauptbahnhof to Winterthur via Wallisellen, which had opened from Oerlikon to Winterthur the previous year. In addition to the tunnel, a bridge, over the River Limmat, was constructed to the south of Wipkingen station, in order to access the throat of the Hautbahnhof station via a descending embankment. In the 1890s, the embankment was replaced by the Aussersihl Viaduct, which carried the Winterthur line over several streets and the railway yards and line to Baden. The footprint of the older embankment route is today occupied by Röntgenstrasse. As built, the tunnel was long, with a southern portal close to the Rosengartenstrasse. In the 1990s, the tunnel was extended to the south, by covering the existing railway cutting, so that the new southern portal was immediately to the north of Wipkingen station. As a result of the extension, the tunnel is now in length. The Wipkingen Tunnel is now one of three different routes from Oerlikon to Hauptbahnhof, each of which tunnels through the intermediate ridge and emerges from adjacent portals to the south of Oerlikon station. Like the Wipkingen Tunnel, the Käferberg Tunnel (opened in 1969) connects to the Hauptbahnhof's western approaches, whilst the Weinberg Tunnel (opened in 2014) accesses the Hauptbahnhof's lower level through platforms from the east. Since the opening of the Weinberg Tunnel, use of the Wipkingen Tunnel is largely confined to long distance trains, with most Zürich S-Bahn services using either the Weinberg or Käferberg tunnels. However to ensure that Wipkingen station is still served, the half-hourly S-Bahn service S24 uses the Wipkingen Tunnel. As there is no rail access from the Wipkingen route to the Hauptbahnhof's low-level through platforms, this necessitates that the S24 reverses in the high-level terminal platforms, making it the only remaining S-Bahn service to do so. == References  External links == * Category:Transport in Zürich Category:Railway tunnels in Switzerland Category:Tunnels completed in 1856 ","title":"Wipkingen Tunnel"},{"id":"46373339","text":"Catalent, Inc.

The legislation allows the U.S. military to give civilian law enforcement agencies access to its military bases and its military equipment. The legislation was promoted during the Presidency of Ronald Reagan in the context of the War on drugs, and is considered a part of a general trend towards the militarization of police. The Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 established the Office of National Drug Control Policy, which was charged with establishing policies, priorities, and objectives for the nation's drug control program; the office established five long-term goals, including the support of law enforcement officials and counterdrug training. In 1989, the National Guard began conducting interdiction and anti-drug activities in the fight against illicit drugs. The Department of Defense established the MCTFT in 1993, and since this time the MCTFT has trainined more than one million registered students through live and distance learning courses.

Toledo Samuel ben Meir Ha-Levi Abulafia (Úbeda, approx. 1320 - Seville, 1360), was the treasurer of king Pedro I \\"the Cruel\\" of Castile and founder of the Synagogue of El Transito in Toledo, Spain. Born to the Abu-l-Afiyat family of Tunisian Jewish origins his parents died of plague shortly after arriving in Toledo. First he worked as administrator to the Portuguese knight Juan Alfonso de Alburquerque and became recognized enough to achieve employment at the court of Pedro I of Castile, first as camarero mayor (chamberlain) and later as almojarife (treasurer) and as oídor (judge). His employment ended when the enemies of Pedro I led by Henry of Trastámara organized a pogrom against the Toledan Jewry, which enabled them to assume possession of the royal treasures. The king marched to Toro to demand the return of his belongings, and Samuel Ha-Levi accompanied him, and later supported the King in reclaiming Toledo for the crown, and in the establishment of a peace treaty with the Portuguese at Évora in 1358.Clara Estow. 1995. Pedro the Cruel of Castile: 1350-1369. BRILL, 1995 - History In Toledo he lived in the palace that is today the Museo de El Greco, and with the considerable riches bestowed upon him by his employer he founded the Synagogue of El Transito between 1355 and 1357.Ilia M. Rodov. 2013. The Torah Ark in Renaissance Poland: A Jewish Revival of Classical Antiquity, BRILL, p.11 The building was one of ten small synagogues serving Toledo's large Jewish population, and while architecturally exquisite its dimensions are not particularly impressive. Its construction was opposed vociferously by the Catholic church, but King Pedro permitted it. Constantly criticized by his rivals for his permissive stance towards Jews, eventually the King turned against ha-Levi and had him incarcerated and tortured on suspicion of embezzlement in 1360.Joan Comay, Lavinia Cohn-Sherbok. 2002. Who's who in Jewish History: After the Period of the Old Testament. Psychology Press.p. 8David Biale. 2012. Cultures of the Jews: A New History. Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group p. 411 He died under duress of torture. The prominence of Samuel Ha-Levi at Pedro's court has often been cited as evidence of his supposed pro-Jewish sentiment, but Ha-Levi's success did not necessarily reflect the general experience of the Spanish Jewry in this period which was often marked by discrimination and pogroms. And even Samuel's career shows that the opportunities for Jews were restricted to certain offices and positions whereas other forms of advancement were denied to them. ==References== Category:1360 deaths Category:Medieval Spanish Jews Category:People from Toledo, Spain Category:Year of birth uncertain Category:14th-century Jews Category:14th-century Castilians Category:People from Úbeda ","title":"Samuel HaLevi"},{"id":"46373482","text":"Frederica Henriette of Anhalt-Bernburg (24 January 1702-4 April 1723), was a member of the House of Ascania and Princess of Anhalt-Bernburg by birth and a Princess of Anhalt-Köthen by marriage. == Life == Frederica Henriette was born in Bernburg, Anhalt, Holy Roman Empire as the fourth daughter and the youngest child of Charles Frederick, Prince of Anhalt-Bernburg (1668-1721) by his first wife Sophie Albertine of Solms-Sonnenwalde (1672-1708).

All 55 seats in the City Council were up for election. The election was held simultaneously with regional elections in thirteen autonomous communities and local elections all throughout Spain. People's Party (PP) incumbent José María Álvarez del Manzano again won an absolute majority of seats, improving his position relative to others as he obtained nearly 250,000 votes more than four years before. In contrast, the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) plummeted to one of its worst historical results, obtaining only 16 seats, to the benefit of United Left (IU) which scored its best result to date. Turnout was one of the highest in the history of the city, at 71.2%. ==Electoral system== The City Council of Madrid () was the top-tier administrative and governing body of the municipality of Madrid, composed of the mayor, the government council and the elected plenary assembly. Elections to the local councils in Spain were fixed for the fourth Sunday of May every four years. Voting for the local assembly was on the basis of universal suffrage, which comprised all nationals over eighteen, registered in the municipality of Madrid and in full enjoyment of their political rights, as well as resident non-nationals whose country of origin allowed Spanish nationals to vote in their own elections by virtue of a treaty. Local councillors were elected using the D'Hondt method and a closed list proportional representation, with a threshold of five percent of valid votes—which included blank ballots—being applied in each local council. Parties not reaching the threshold were not taken into consideration for seat distribution. Councillors were allocated to municipal councils based on the following scale: {  left; font-size:95%;\\" - bgcolor=\\"#E9E9E9\\" align=\\"center\\" ! width=\\"120\\" Population ! width=\\"265\\" Councillors -  <250  5 -  251–1,000  7 -  1,001–2,000  9 -  2,001–5,000  11 -  5,001–10,000  13 -  10,001–20,000  17 -  20,001–50,000  21 -  50,001–100,000  25 -  >100,001  +1 per each 100,000 inhabitants or fraction +1 if total is an even number } The mayor was indirectly elected by the plenary assembly. A legal clause required that mayoral candidates earned the vote of an absolute majority of councillors, or else the candidate of the most-voted party in the assembly was to be automatically appointed to the post. In the event of a tie, a toss-up would determine the appointee. The electoral law allowed for parties and federations registered in the interior ministry, coalitions and groupings of electors to present lists of candidates. Parties and federations intending to form a coalition ahead of an election were required to inform the relevant Electoral Commission within ten days of the election call, whereas groupings of electors needed to secure the signature of a determined amount of the electors registered in the municipality for which they were seeking election, disallowing electors from signing for more than one list of candidates. For the case of Madrid, as its population was over 1,000,001, at least 8,000 signatures were required. ==Opinion polls== The table below lists voting intention estimates in reverse chronological order, showing the most recent first and using the dates when the survey fieldwork was done, as opposed to the date of publication. Where the fieldwork dates are unknown, the date of publication is given instead.

After a national competition to attract architects, the firm Shadley Associates was selected to build the park. The park incorporates the existing Dixie's Tavern and UNCC buildings, and new construction will include an office tower, hotel, and parking deck on adjacent land. The park is located at the corner of 7th and Brevard St, adjacent to ImaginOn and the Lynx light rail tracks. Completion of the park occurred on December 8, 2015 with a dedication ceremony followed by tours of the park. This marked the completion of a major park in each of Uptown Charlotte's four wards. ==Planning== Development of the First Ward Park and surrounding areas had been in planning for several decades by Daniel Levine, owner of Levine Properties, which holds 24 acres of land in First Ward. Under a joint partnership between Levine Properties, UNC Charlotte, Mecklenburg County and the City of Charlotte, Levine will trade the park property with the county for an area of land along Brevard between 8th and 9th streets. The First Ward Park was highlighted in the Charlotte 2020 Vision Plan adopted by the City Council in September 2011. The park is mentioned as the keystone of a \\"First Ward Village\\" that would include development of surrounding vacant lots. One of the key accomplishments of such a park would be \\"creating attractive, active spaces and focal points for each of [the Uptown] neighborhoods. Developers and city officials were hoping that the park could serve as a catalyst similar to what happened after the construction of nearby Romare Bearden Park and BB&T; Ballpark in the Third Ward of Uptown Charlotte, which spurred development of several apartment and office buildings. ==Surrounding Development== Fountain in First Ward Park Dixie's Tavern Building Historical renovation of the Philip Carey building on 7th street (aka Dixie's Tavern) will turn the building into modern offices. In December, it was announced that the tenant for the Philip Carey building was Google Fiber- who will use the building as their regional HQ. Apartments and Parking Deck As of October 2015, construction of an apartment complex and parking deck located roughly two blocks northeast of the park was on hold as Levine Properties waited for payment from UNC Charlotte, which is contributing $4.2 million to use 300 spaces in the 1,300-space deck. The apartment complex will have 264 units and wrap around the parking deck. Hotels Hotel construction will likely occur before the office tower. The hotels will be a Canopy and Homewood Suites hotel, which are Hilton-owned brands. Construction could begin as early as 2016. Office Tower An office tower is planned adjacent to the park at the corner of 9th Street and the light rail tracks. Search for an anchor tenant is still ongoing however, and construction won't start without one. ==References(Mecklenburg County Parks and Recreation) * * Category:2015 establishments in North Carolina Category:Parks in Charlotte, North Carolina Category:Protected areas established in 2015 ","title":"First Ward Park (Charlotte, North Carolina)"},{"id":"46373698","text":"Jaime Matthew Schultz (born June 20, 1991) is an American professional baseball pitcher in the Oakland Athletics organization.

He was the first Director of the Nature Conservancy (UK) for Scotland (1949 to 1967). He was the youngest and longest served Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh during the 20th century. ==Life== He was born on 5 August 1907, the son of William Berry of Tayfield, an advocate in Edinburgh. His father instilled in him a love of nature conservation and especially bird protection. His mother died in his early youth and he was largely raised by aunts. He suffered from brittle bones and dyslexia. John was sent to boarding school, being educated at Eton College in England, and then continuing on to Trinity College, Cambridge and then receiving a PhD at St Andrews University. Here he shared accommodation (and a love of birds) with Peter Scott, later to become one of Britain’s most loved ornithologists. During this time Berry was nicknamed ’’’Gooseberry’’’, due to his love and knowledge of geese. In 1936 he married fellow ornithologist, Bride Fremantle. Upon graduation, Berry first found employment at University College, Dundee, researching the biology of fish, then moving to the University of Southampton. Here he came to the attention of Prof D’Arcy Thompson and was persuaded to study for a Doctorate at St Andrews University. In 1936, aged only 29 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, the youngest Fellow of the 20th century. Having 66 years service in the Society he was also the oldest Fellow and the longest served. In the 1930s he was involved in counter-intelligence work in Germany and Hungary. During the Second World War he was the official Press Censor for Scotland (1940–44). During this same period he was commissioned by the Scottish Hydro-Electricity Board to design the Pitlochry fish ladder to allow migrating salmon to circumnavigate the large dam built there. This included viewing galleries for the public as it was realised this strange feature had strong value as a visitor attraction. In October 1948 he represented Britain at the conference establishing the International Union for Conservation of Nature at Fontainbleau in France. Berry was established as Head of Nature Conservation in Scotland immediately thereafter, prior to the legal implementation of the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act the next year. In 1951 he declared Beinn Eighe the first Scottish National Nature Reserve. He went on to designate Tentsmuir Forest, Morton Lochs, Loch Leven and the Cairngorms. He also brought about the acquisition of Rùm and St Kilda. In 1969 he was elected Deputy Lieutenant of Fife. In 1970 Dundee University awarded him an Honorary Doctor of Letters (LLD) and in 1991 St Andrews University awarded him an Honorary Doctor of Science. John Berry died on 19 February 2002 aged 94. His archives, including papers relating to his work on North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board projects and their environmental impact and several files relating to his work on wildfowl, are held by Archive Services at the University of Dundee. ==Publications== *’’Wild Geese and Wild Duck of Scotland’’ (1939) with the aid of data from his childhood friends, Mss Baxter and Rintoul ==References== Category:Scottish zoologists Category:1907 births Category:2002 deaths Category:People educated at Eton College Category:20th-century British scientists Category:20th-century Scottish people Category:Alumni of Trinity College, Cambridge Category:Alumni of the University of St Andrews Category:Deputy Lieutenants of Fife Category:Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh Category:Academics of the University of Dundee Category:People from Newport-on-Tay Category:People with dyslexia Category:20th-century zoologists ","title":"John Berry (zoologist)"},{"id":"46373741","text":"Shanganagh Cemetery is a cemetery in south County Dublin, in the administrative county of Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown just to the south of Shankill.

He is a former U.S. Navy chief medical officer who has served as a refugee camp physician on the Afghanistan–Pakistan frontier. Carlin is board certified in Emergency Medicine and holds a consultant-staff appointment at Lahey Hospital and Medical Center in suburban Boston. He has been in practice for 29 years. == Education == Dr. Carlin graduated from Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania with a double degree in chemistry and philosophy in 1981. He earned his medical degree from Tufts University School of Medicine in Boston, Massachusetts in 1985. He was the medical officer on board the USS Mississippi from 1986 to 1988. == Career == Carlin founded Voyager Medicine in 1996 to remotely treat seafaring crews. Operating from land, he used his beeper and cell phone to provide real-time medical consultations for sick and injured sailors. This business venture put him at the forefront of the emerging field of telemedicine healthcare. Carlin is a recognized leader in the field of connected care and promotes the use of the latest mobile health devices to provide personal health diagnosis, treatment, and health management to patients. In 1998 he founded WorldClinic with the goal of leveraging simple technology to deliver medical care anywhere in the world. He drew on his experience as a refugee camp physician and ship's doctor to optimize telemedical care delivery to at-risk populations—people without access to, or disconnected from, modern medical care. His personal experience as a refugee camp doctor heightened his awareness of the increased vulnerability of people in remote locations, under-resourced environments, and conflict areas—particularly women and children. Carlin achieved notoriety after he e-mailed life-saving surgical instructions to Viktor Yazykov, a solo yacht racer participating in the Around Alone yacht race. Fifty-year-old Yazykov, suffering from a dangerous elbow infection and 1,000 miles away from the coast, was able to successfully self-operate after receiving Carlin's diagnosis and guidance using e-mail. The story received worldwide attention and was featured in The New York Times, the British Broadcasting Corporation, Dateline NBC, Oprah, The Today Show, and others. Later that year, Carlin expanded WorldClinic to include remote locations and key employees of global corporations. Since then, the company's work has been featured in Bloomberg Businessweek, Forbes, Fortune, Financial Times, and The Wall Street Journal. Carlin is a frequent speaker to both medical and international development audiences and has lectured at institutions such as MIT Media Lab, US Naval Academy, Cleveland Clinic, and the International Economic Development Council. He also writes a regular column on health issues for Worth Magazine and is frequently quoted on the topics of healthcare, mHealth, and telemedicine. His current work focuses on leveraging telemedicine to care not only for individuals, but also to organize and deliver care to entire populations. == See also == * Telemedicine * mHealth * eHealth * American Telemedicine Association * Concierge medicine == References == Category:American health care chief executives Category:Carnegie Mellon University alumni Category:Tufts University School of Medicine alumni Category:1959 births Category:Living people Category:Place of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Daniel Carlin"},{"id":"46373766","text":"A feedback model of the motivation-volition process. Lower labels are terminology of Zimmerman. In psychological theories of motivation, the Rubicon model, more completely the Rubicon model of action phases, makes a distinction between motivational and volitional processes. The Rubicon model \\"defines clear boundaries between motivational and action phases\\". The first boundary \\"separates the motivational process of the predecisional phase from the volitional processes of postdecisional phase.\\" Another boundary is that between initiation and conclusion of an action. A self-regulatory feedback model incorporating these interfaces was proposed later by others, as illustrated in the figure. The name \\"Rubicon model\\" derives from the tale of Caesar's crossing the Rubicon River, a point of no return, thereby revealing his intentions. According to the Rubicon model, every action includes such a point of no return at which the individual moves from goal setting to goal striving. :\\"Once subjects move from planning and goal-setting to the implementation of plans, they cross a metaphorical Rubicon. That is, their goals are typically protected and fostered by self-regulatory activity rather than reconsidered or changed, often even when challenged.\\" ::— Lyn Corno, The best laid plans, p. 15 (quoted by Rauber) The Rubicon model addresses four questions, as identified by Achtziger and Gollwitzer: #How do people select their goals? #How do they plan the execution of their goals? #How do they enact their plans? #How do they evaluate their efforts to accomplish a specific goal? The study of these issues is undertaken by both the fields of cognitive neuroscience and social psychology. A possible connection between these approaches is brain imaging work attempting to relate volition to neuroanatomy. ==Background== Human action coordinates such aspects of human behavior as perception, thought, emotion, and skills to classify goals as attainable or unattainable and then to engage or disengage in trying to attain these goals. According to Heckhausen & Heckhausen, \\"Research based on the Rubicon model of action phases has provided a wealth of empirical evidence for mental and behavioral resources being orchestrated in this manner.\\" Engagement and disengagement with goals affects personal distress over the unachievable. \\"By having new goals available, and reengaging in those new goals, a person can reduce distress....while continuing to derive a sense of purpose in life by finding other pursuits of value.\\" ==See also== *Cognitive psychology *Executive functions *Delayed gratification *Motivation *Self-control *Self- efficacy *Self-regulated learning *Self-regulation theory ==References== Category:Psychology stubs Category:Autonomy Category:Decision theory Category:Free will Category:Motivation Category:Planning ","title":"Rubicon model (psychology)"},{"id":"46373774","text":"North East Gonja District is one of the districts in the Savannah Region of Ghana.

The total stolen may have a value of up to £200 million, and the incident has been called the \\"largest burglary in British legal history\\". The heist was planned and carried out by six elderly men who were experienced thieves, all of whom pleaded guilty and received prison sentences in March 2016. Four other men were also tried on suspicion of involvement; three were found guilty and sent to prison, while the fourth was cleared. ==Burglary== The burglars worked through the four-day weekend of the Easter Bank Holiday, when many of the nearby businesses (many of them also connected with Hatton Garden's jewellery trade) were closed. There was no externally visible sign of a forced entry to the premises. It was reported that the burglars had entered the premises through a lift shaft, then drilled through the thick vault walls with a Hilti DD350 industrial power drill. The police first announced that the facility had been burgled on 7 April, and reports based on CCTV footage (released by the Daily Mirror before the police released it) state that the attack on the facility commenced on Thursday 2 April. The video showed people nicknamed by the newspaper as \\"Mr Ginger, Mr Strong, Mr Montana, The Gent, The Tall Man and The Old Man\\". On 22 April, the police released pictures of the inside of the vault showing damage caused by the burglary, and how the burglars had used holes drilled through the vault's wall to bypass the main vault door. The theft was so significant that the investigation was assigned to the Flying Squad, a branch of the Specialist, Organised & Economic Crime Command within London's Metropolitan Police Service. On 8 April, press reports emerged speculating that a major underground fire in nearby Kingsway may have been started to create a diversion as part of the Hatton Garden burglary. The London Fire Brigade later stated that the fire had been caused by an electrical fault, with no sign of arson. The underground fire in Kingsway which disrupted the area ==Timeline== Police at Hatton Gardens Safe Deposits *On 1 April 2015, electrical cables under the pavement in Kingsway caught fire, leading to serious disruption in central London. The fire continued for the next two days, with flames shooting out of a manhole cover from a burst gas main, before being extinguished. Several thousand people were evacuated from nearby offices, and several West End theatres cancelled performances. There was also substantial disruption to telecoms infrastructure. *2 April: 21:19 depository staff locked doors for the Easter weekend *2 April: 21:23 \\"Mr Ginger\\" descended to the vault, followed by three men pulling wheelie bins *3 April: 00:21 Metropolitan Police were informed that the burglar alarm had been triggered *3 April: 08:05 gang members talked before going to their van and driving away *4 April: 21:17 \\"Mr Ginger\\" went down into vault, and was later joined by two other men *5 April: 06:10 the gang members drove away from the bank *7 April: Scotland Yard said that they were aware of the burglary *10 April: The Daily Mirror released CCTV footage *19 May: The Metropolitan Police announced that they had arrested nine suspects *1 September: Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Company went into liquidation *28 March 2018: Another man was arrested ==Arrests== On 19 May 2015, 76-year-old Brian Reader, who had previously been involved in laundering the proceeds of the Brink's-Mat robbery, was arrested in connection with the burglary by Flying Squad officers. In November 2015, Carl Wood, William Lincoln, Jon Harbinson and Hugh Doyle were all charged with conspiracy to commit burglary and conspiracy to conceal, convert or transfer criminal property. The theft was described as the \\"largest burglary in English legal history\\". Three years after the attack, on 28 March 2018, Michael Seed, 57, was arrested after his home in Islington, London, had been searched. He was charged with conspiracy to burgle and conspiracy to conceal or disguise criminal property. ==Sentencing== On 9 March 2016, at Woolwich Crown Court, three members of the gang, John \\"Kenny\\" Collins, Daniel Jones, and Terry Perkins, having pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit burglary, were each given a seven-year prison term. Carl Wood and William Lincoln were found guilty of the same offence and also one count of conspiracy to conceal, convert or transfer criminal property, after trial. Lincoln was also given a seven-year sentence, and Wood was jailed for six years. Hugh Doyle was found guilty of concealing, converting or transferring criminal property. He was jailed for 21 months, suspended for two years. Doyle was also fined £367.50 for his general criminal conduct in January 2018. The alleged ringleader, Brian Reader, was sentenced to six years and three months in jail on 21 March 2016. An eighth man, Jon Harbinson, was found not guilty and discharged. In January 2018, a confiscation ruling at Woolwich Crown Court ruled that John \\"Kenny\\" Collins, Daniel Jones, Terry Perkins, and Brian Reader must pay a total of £27.5 million or face another seven years in jail. Perkins died in prison in February 2018, just a week after the ruling. On 14 August 2018, Daniel Jones had his sentence extended by six years and 287 days for failing to return £6,599,021. On 1 August 2019, Collins was sentenced to an additional 2,309 days in jail for failing to comply with the confiscation order. It was revealed during the hearing Collins had repaid £732,000 of the £7.6m order. Enforcement action was said by the Crown Prosecution Service to be underway to seize Collins' remaining assets. On 15 March 2019, Michael Seed was found guilty of burglary and conspiracy to burgle and was sentenced to 10 years in prison for the former and eight years for the latter, the two running concurrently. On 1 October 2020, Michael Seed was ordered to repay £6m in damages or face seven years in jail. ==In television, film and radio== The robbery featured in episode five (\\"Heist!\\") of the American investigative science web-TV series White Rabbit Project, released on 9 December 2016. In the programme, presenters investigate and demonstrate the methods used in the heist and show dramatised re-enactments. The burglary is the subject of three feature films: Hatton Garden: The Heist (2016); The Hatton Garden Job (2017), starring Larry Lamb and Phil Daniels; and King of Thieves (2018), starring Michael Caine and Ray Winstone. A four-part television serial, Hatton Garden, starring Kenneth Cranham and Timothy Spall, was aired on ITV in May 2019, after being delayed for 18 months due to legal developments.

The results were devastating for the Moderates, who lost control of the Corporation to Labour for the first time, despite socialist candidates making gains in Glasgow at successive general elections. Labour’s victory came as a surprise, even to the party itself, which had already begun blaming its anticipated defeat on vote-splitting caused by the presence of the ILP & the Communists. Labour's dominance of the Corporation would continue, nearly unbroken, to the present day. Despite winning a combined share of 52.5% of the vote, compared to the Labour/ILP share of 42.8%, the FPTP nature of the ward voting system meant that the split in the Moderate vote allowed Labour to make strong gains at the Moderates expense. Radcliffe acknowledged and welcomed the role he had played in causing the downfall of the Moderate led Corporation, claiming that \\"if the Socialists have a majority in Glasgow Town Council, they have the Scottish Protestant League to thank for it.\\" A split between Labour and the Independent Labour Party had ensued a year prior, although Patrick Dollan; a Glaswegian socialist of Irish descent, was able to keep the bulk of the Glasgweian-based ILP on-side. Despite strong support for Labour amongst Glaswegians of Catholic-Irish origin, only 6 out of Glasgow's 116 Councillors following the election were Catholic. The Moderates were not to bounce back in the following years election either however, and the combined Moderates/SPL share of the vote fell to 46.4%, whilst the Labour/ILP share rose to 51%. Even after several years, when the SPL had faded from the political picture, the Moderate vote did not rebound to its pre-split height, with many SPL voters in turn moving to Labour. The election was not only a disappointment for Glasgow's right wing parties, but also for its far-left. The Communist party had fielded 15 candidates; who in fact performed moderately well in several working class wards, notably Cowlairs, Springburn, and Gorbals. Despite this however the party failed to gain a single seat, and ultimately won only 10,484 votes; or 3.4% of the total 311,000 votes cast. ==Election resultWards== Anderston Camphill Calton Cathcart Cowcaddens Gorbals Govan ==References== Category:1933 Scottish local elections 1933 Category:1930s in Glasgow ","title":"1933 Glasgow Corporation election"},{"id":"46374030","text":"The Western Michigan University Soccer Complex is a soccer-specific stadium located in Kalamazoo, Michigan on the campus of Western Michigan University.

It is part of the international syndication The Voice based on the reality singing competition launched in the Netherlands, created by Dutch television producer John de Mol. One of the important premises of the show is the quality of the singing talent. Four coaches, themselves popular performing artists, train the talents in their group and occasionally perform with them. Talents are selected in blind auditions, where the coaches cannot see, but only hear the auditioner. == Format == The series consists of three phases: a blind audition, a battle phase, and live performance shows. Four judges/coaches, all noteworthy recording artists, choose teams of contestants through a blind audition process. Each judge has the length of the auditioner's performance (about one minute) to decide if he or she wants that singer on his or her team; if two or more judges want the same singer (as happens frequently), the singer has the final choice of coach. Each team of singers is mentored and developed by its respective coach. In the second stage, called the battle phase, coaches have two of their team members battle against each other directly by singing the same song together, with the coach choosing which team member to advance from each of four individual \\"battles\\" into the first live round. Within that first live round, the surviving acts from each team again compete head-to-head, with a combination of public and jury vote deciding who advances onto the next round. In the final phase, the remaining contestants (top 8) compete against each other in live broadcasts. The television audience and the coaches have equal say 50/50 in deciding who moves on to the final 4 phase.

Charles Hoffbauer, Gropper Art Gallery, p. 3. == Early life and education == Charles Hoffbauer was born in Paris. His parents, Féodor Hubert Hoffbauer and Marie Clemence Belloc Hoffbauer, were of Alsatian origin.

After receiving a traditional elementary and secondary education in French schools, Hoffbauer attended the École des Beaux-Arts for three years. He studied under Fernand Cormon, François Flemeng, and symbolist painter Gustave Moreau. Classmates of Hoffbauer included Paul Baignères, Charles Camoin, Henri Evenepoel, Raoul du Gardier, Henri Manguin, Albert Marquet, Henri Matisse and Georges Rouault. Shortly before his 21st birthday, Hoffbauer reported for his mandatory French military service. He trained at Falaise, Normandy for 18 months. Completing his military service in September 1897, he returned to Paris and began his career as an artist. == Early career and awards == Hoffbauer's early works received recognition and awards. In 1898 his painting Reunion de bourgeois aux XIVe siècle earned an honorable mention at his first exhibition at the Paris Salon. The following year, he received a gold medal for Les Gueux, becoming the youngest artist to receive this award. The Musée de Rouen in France purchased the painting. In 1900 he received a bronze medal at the Paris Exposition Universelle. At the 1902 Paris Salon his painting Revolte des Flamandes earned the Prix Rosa Bonheur and was purchased by the Philadelphia Museum. The French government awarded a traveling fellowship for this painting, which allowed Hoffbauer to spend the summer of 1903 in Italy. In 1904, he exhibited Champs de bataille at the Paris Salon. Although it received no awards, the painting earned favorable comments and was purchased by the Musée de Luxembourg.Gropper, p. 6. At the 1905 Paris Salon, Hoffbauer entered his painting Sur les toits, which depicts several well-dressed diners at an upscale New York City rooftop restaurant. Although he had never visited the United States, Hoffbauer had chanced to see some photographs of New York skyscrapers in a bookstore window while visiting Rome. Based on his memory of the photographs, he imagined what a rooftop dining scene would look like and painted a preliminary study after returning to Paris in 1904, using his friends and fellow artists Raoul du Gardier and Rudulph Evans as models. Shortly before the opening of the Paris Salon, Hoffbauer became dissatisfied with his work and decided to withdraw and revise the painting for resubmission. The new version, which was completed in 10 days, earned no awards but received significant critical acclaim. According to one reviewer, \\"'Sur les toits' is without question the most interesting picture of the year; it is accepted as the 'nail' of the Old Salon. . . .

Hoffbauer entered the work in the Paris Salon, where it earned the Prix National du Salon. The award, the highest prize of the Salon, provided a substantial 10,000 franc traveling fellowship. Over the next few years, Hoffbauer visited Great Britain, Belgium, the Netherlands, Milan, Cairo, Luxor, Aswan, Athens, Rome, Venice, and the United States.

Hoffbauer first arrived in the United States in New York City on December 21, 1909. His friend and fellow artist Charles Dana Gibson met him as he arrived and helped establish Hoffbauer in the New York art community. For the first time he was able to visit the skyscrapers that he had used in Sur les Toits and later wrote to his mother that he had accurately depicted the rooftop setting. He painted watercolors while visiting the Adirondacks, and in Boston he made drawings of local airplane races. In New York City, he began a long- term professional relationship with Roland Knoedler of Knoedler Galleries. Knoedler became Hoffbauer’s U.S. representative and held numerous exhibitions of the artist’s work, including a 1912 repainting of Triomphe d’un Condottiere.Gropper, p. 12. By the following year, Hoffbauer had established himself as a well-regarded artist with an international reputation.Levy, Florence N. (Ed.) (1913). “Who’s who in Art”. American Art Annual 10, 281. Google Book search. Retrieved on April 22, 2015. == Confederate Memorial Association murals ==  Contract and initial development  One of the attendees at the exhibition of the repainted Triomphe d’un Condottiere was James Wall Finn. Finn, a painter himself, was searching for an artist for a large project on behalf of Thomas Fortune Ryan and James Taylor Ellyson. Ellyson, lieutenant governor of Virginia and a former private in the Confederate army, was president of the Confederate Memorial Association. In 1912, the Association had nearly completed its headquarters building, the Confederate Memorial Institute (popularly known as Battle AbbeyFounded in 1896, the association was established to honor Confederate soldiers who died in the Civil War. In 1946, the Virginia Historical Society absorbed the association and became the owner of Battle Abbey and its contents. See \\"About VHS-Our History .\\"), in Richmond, Virginia. Ellyson’s goal was to decorate the south wing of the building as a memorial to the valor of the fallen Confederacy. He stated, “I have for several years had the ambitious desire to have a collection of mural paintings similar to those to be found in the great gallery at Versailles.” He secured $20,000 in funding from Ryan, a native Virginian and wealthy New York financier.“Mural art will decorate hall”. (September 27, 1912). The Times Dispatch, p. 1. Finn was impressed with Hoffbauer and his work and recommended the artist to Ryan and Ellyson. On July 27, 1912, Ellyson and Hoffbauer signed a four-page contract requiring the artist to “. . . provide all material and perform all work for the Mural decorations of the four walls of the south wing of the Confederate Memorial Institute.” The artist’s compensation was $20,000, and he was to complete the project within 2 years. The contract specified that Hoffbauer would “guarantee the performance and good condition of his work” for 20 years after completion. He also agreed to copyright the murals and retain the copyright in his possession.Hoffbauer, Charles, and Ellyson, J. Taylor (July 27, 1912). Untitled contract, pp. 1-4. “Charles Hoffbauer papers, 1891-1974,” Archives of American Art. In January 1913, Hoffbauer began work at the Institute. He used thousands of Mathew Brady photographs as a means of visualizing scenes from over a decade before his birth, and ready access to Civil War veterans next door at the R.E. Lee Camp provided a source of living history. To produce the murals, Hoffbauer drew hundreds of small pen-and-ink sketches. From these, he created 60 larger pastel and crayon drawings. Most of the sketches and drawings were created on grids so that the images could be proportionately enlarged for final painting on the mural walls. He also prepared over a dozen three-dimensional clay models, which allowed him to test perspectives and the arrangement of characters and equipment in order to determine the optimal staging of scenes. For human models, Hoffbauer chose local citizens, including Bob Campbell, a local stonemason whose likeness was used for many of the common soldiers; sculptor Edward Valentine for a doctor; Patterson Avenue resident Julian Garthright for a wounded soldier on a hospital cot; Garthright’s aunt, a United Daughters of the Confederacy librarian, for a nurse; a Jefferson Hotel bellman for a black soldier; and James Ellyson for an artilleryman.Rasmussen, William M.S.

Retrieved on April 13, 2005.  War service  Hoffbauer had worked for over 18 months on his 2-year contract, when on August 8, 1914, he departed for France with the murals only partially completed. Although he had met his military obligation, he was a reservist in the French army and decided to return to his homeland to fight in World War I. He enlisted as a private in the 274th Infantry Regiment.Gropper, p. 14. In a January 27, 1915, letter to Ellyson, Hoffbauer reported, \\"I volunteered to go to the front, and was sent near Rheims. . . . After a period of most bloody battles . . . my regiment is now checking the Germans before Rheims. We live in trenches, and are rapidly returning to the state of civilization of the cave man. I am writing this letter in a little hole . . . six feet underground. . . . My fountain pen and the telephone apparatus hanging near me (for I am a telephonist) are the only remains of civilization . . . thousands and thousands of men will die. . . .”“Hoffbauer writes of war in trenches”. (July 3, 1915). Richmond Times- Dispatch, p. 7. In a later letter he wrote, “I went to Soissons too. Soissons is entirely ruined and the battle field was awful to look on. Everywhere tanks and airplanes battered down and out of order, dead horses and men and guns and ammunition spread over the fields, an awful sight.””French master of art quits palette for war”. (September 26, 1918). Richmond Times-Dispatch, p. 4. Hoffbauer also wrote an article for Leslie’s Illustrated Weekly, titled “Horrors of Trench Life in France.” For a time, he served as an official war artist and also worked as a liaison between the Camouflage Section of his unit and the American camouflage unit. He was promoted to sergeant and received the Croix de Guerre for bravery in the Battle of the Somme.  Completion  His war service concluded, Hoffbauer spent a few months at his home in France and vacationed in Italy. He returned to Richmond to resume work on the murals in May 1919.Gropper, p. 16. To the astonishment of the Confederate Memorial Association, Hoffbauer completely removed all of his prior work and began anew. He stated, “Not being satisfied with the work already done in the Confederate Memorial, [I] scrap[p]ed over the whole thing and started all over again on a new design.”Hoffbauer, Charles (undated). Untitled autobiography, Virginia Historical Society, p. 1 His battlefield experience had provided a new perspective on armed conflict that he desired to capture in his Civil War scenes. Hoffbauer completed the project in January 1921 and shortly thereafter commented, “I have given the best that is within me to the work.” Hoffbauer's completed artwork, the Memorial Military MuralsIn 2010, the Virginia Historical Society began a multi-year program to clean and conserve the murals, which had been damaged by water and environmental contaminants. The murals are the largest artifact held by the society. See \\"Restoring the Hoffbauer Murals. \\" (also known as the Four Seasons of the Confederacy), consists of four large panels reflecting progressive stages of the war from the perspective of the Confederate military (artillery, infantry, and cavalry) along with four smaller panels along the east and west walls with complementary scenes. The Association’s display of the murals to the public on February 1, 1921, was met with praise and earned Hoffbauer considerable recognition.“Restoring the murals .” Virginia Historical Society.

Richmond Times-Dispatch, p. 1. == Later career == After leaving Richmond, Hoffbauer obtained additional mural and other art commissions. In May 1921, he received a commission to paint a mural at the recently completed Missouri State Capitol (the prior building was destroyed by fire in 1911). The large mural, located in the House of Representatives, shows Missouri troops in France during World War I.

In 1923, the Hotel des Invalides in Paris commissioned Hoffbauer to paint decorations in the Salle d’Honneur, for which he later received the Prix de l’Institut de France. He exhibited several works in Canada, France, and the United States. He extensively decorated the Château d'Artigny' ballroom and library for perfume magnate François Coty. In 1930, he painted a large mural for the town hall of Arras, France.Gropper, pp. 16, 18. In 1935, Hoffbauer attended in Paris a showing of the Walt Disney movie The Three Little Pigs. After viewing the movie, it occurred to him that his artistic ability would be a good match for the animation field and that motion pictures could provide an excellent venue for conveying history. With the idea of making an historical animated movie, over the next two years Hoffbauer researched Napoleon’s 1812 invasion of Russia and drew thousands of sketches. From these sketches, he created 120 temperas, which he titled Napoleon’s Russian Campaign. In April 1938, Hoffbauer returned to the United States to repair some damage to the Confederate murals and to accept an honorary doctor of fine arts degree awarded by the University of Richmond. He visited New York in July and arranged a meeting with Walt Disney. Hoffbauer presented the temperas and the idea of an animated historical motion picture. Disney was impressed but explained that the Napoleonic theme was not consistent with the typical subject matter of his movies. He stated, “Mr. Hoffbauer, I’ll never be the artist you are, but . . . I deal in whimsy.” However, he offered to assist the artist if Hoffbauer came to Hollywood.Gropper, p. 20. In 1939, Hoffbauer and his wife, Henrietta, moved from Paris to Hollywood. To assist Hoffbauer, Disney prepared a technicolor filmstrip of the 120 Napoleonic campaign temperas.Gropper, p. 22. Hoping to further interest in a motion picture based on the paintings, Hoffbauer exhibited the temperas at the Los Angeles Museum and stated, “We artists must . . . use this great contemporary medium [animation].”Miller, Arthur (March 3, 1940). \\"The art thrill of the week\\". Los Angeles Times, p. C8. Despite contacts with several motion picture personnel, including actor Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., and producer Walter Wanger, Hoffbauer was unable to generate interest in the material as a movie. Hoffbauer also painted a set of temperas titled The History of Williamsburg in the hope of making an educational filmstrip for the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation. Even though Dr. Douglas Southall Freeman, the Pulitzer Prize-winning editor of the Richmond News Leader, encouraged and endorsed the project, the foundation showed no interest.Dr. Douglas Southall Freeman to Dr. Samuel C. Chew (November 29, 1939). “Charles Hoffbauer papers, 1891-1974,” Archives of American Art. Disney hired Hoffbauer as a research artist for his studio in January 1940. Hoffbauer worked on The Life and Stories of Hans Christian Andersen, which combined animation and live action, a technique pioneered by Disney.“Walt Disney, 65, dies on coast”. (December 16, 1966). The New York Times, p. 40. Hoffbauer painted a series of watercolors on Joan of Arc but was unsuccessful in gaining interest for an animated movie on the subject. In July, the New England Life Insurance Company engaged Hoffbauer to paint eight murals at their headquarters in Boston. The murals depict Boston history from 1622 to 1798. Hoffbauer spent five months in Boston researching the area’s history and, as he had done with the Confederate murals, preparing numerous sketches. He painted the murals in Hollywood and shipped them to Boston when nearly complete. The company installed them in May 1942 for a convention, and then removed them for four months of on-site finishing by Hoffbauer. His work garnered positive comments, with one reviewer stating, “This artist, who so loves history, has managed to present it, not as a series of theatrical events, but as something alive and breathing today.”“Boston art painted here”. (May 4, 1942). Los Angeles Times, p. A2. Hoffbauer, who became a U.S. citizen in 1941, continued his association with Disney for several years. The studio executive sent the Napoleon filmstrip and a project summary to British movie producers Alexander and Vincent Korda. While not opting for the Napoleon endeavor, they offered to employ Hoffbauer on a production of War and Peace. However, World War II soon ensued, and the project was cancelled. Hoffbauer later worked for Paramount Studios as a technical consultant on the movie Monsieur Beaucaire. In 1948, the Fairbanks Company hired him as a technical advisor and artist. In 1951, at the request of the University of California, Hoffbauer gave a lecture in French based on his father’s book Paris à Travers les Ages to commemorate the 2,000th anniversary of the founding of Paris. Reviving the possibility of a production of War and Peace, Hoffbauer contacted director Fred Zinneman about working on an upcoming Mike Todd film based on the novel. To Hoffbauer’s disappointment, Italian producer Dino De Laurentiis acquired the rights to the story and made the movie without the artist’s assistance. Hoffbauer and his wife left California and moved to Rockport, Massachusetts in May 1952. In nearby Boston, Hoffbauer painted an additional mural for the New England Life Insurance Company. For the Hayden Planetarium, he painted one of his most unusual works—a tempera showing the surface of the moon with the Earth just above the moon’s horizon. Hoffbauer continued an active painting career for the remainder of his life.Gropper, pp. 22, 24-25. == Death == In July 1957, Hoffbauer visited with Rockport officials and reviewed the new town hall under construction. He offered to decorate the new building with a mural depicting the town’s history. The painting would be a gift to the town, and he requested no commission.“Charles Hoffbauer.” (July 27, 1957). The Boston Globe, p. 13. A week later in Boston he suffered a ruptured aorta. He died at Massachusetts General Hospital the following day, July 26, 1957.“Standard certificate of death.” (August 1, 1957).

She became involved in performing arts at a young age, singing in the youth choir at her church, and performing in a city dance team. She soon took to writing and began working with producer Rodney Jerkins. Previously signed to Atlantic Records, Monét released her debut EP Nightmares & Lullabies: Act 1 in 2014 and her follow-up EP Nightmares & Lullabies: Act 2 in 2015. Monét would follow this with the Life After Love, Pt. 1 and Life After Love Pt. 2 EPs in February and September 2018 respectively. Part one of her debut album, Jaguar, was released on August 7, 2020. Monét has written songs for a number of artists including Nas, Ariana Grande, Fifth Harmony, T.I., GOOD Music, Lupe Fiasco, Chrisette Michele, Coco Jones, Chris Brown, and Diddy Dirty Money. In 2019, Monét received two Grammy Award nominations for Album of the Year for her work on Grande's Thank U, Next and Record of the Year for \\"7 Rings\\". ==Early life== Monét was born in Georgia to an African American mother of Creole ancestry and French father, and moved to Sacramento, California, as a child. She was fascinated with performing arts, taking an interest in singing and dancing. Her first onstage experience came when she sang in her Catholic school holiday plays. She also sang in the youth choir at her local church but it was dance that initially gave her a sense of herself as a performer. By the time she became a student at the local performing arts high school, Monét had developed a grueling rehearsal schedule. She taught at two different dance studios and rehearsed with a local dance group, Boogie Monstarz, at Step One Dance Studios in Sacramento while working at a local bank. ==Career== 2010–2015: Songwriting and Nightmares & Lullabies Outside of dance rehearsals, Monét began exchanging poetry with an older cousin and found a new passion. This soon translated into her writing her own music. Meanwhile, she had been educating herself on the production world, learning about producers, and making music at a local recording studio. She learned about Rodney Jerkins (aka Darkchild) and decided to add him on Myspace. Shortly after that, he invited her to come to Los Angeles and audition for a new girl group he was forming, Purple Reign. The group landed a record deal with Motown a year later, but was dropped before releasing any music. After the group's disbandment, Monet turned to songwriting to earn money while she waited for her own music career to build up. The first song she worked on was a track for Diddy Dirty Money's 2010 album, Last Train to Paris. She continued to write song hooks and sang the demos herself before sending them out. Her hope was that the labels would like her version enough that they would keep her on the track as a feature. Atlantic Records CEO Craig Kallman heard one of her demos in a meeting and offered her a record deal later that day. Even though she was signed, Monet acknowledged that her songwriting \\"took off\\" before her music, while she was working on both. Her songwriting remained her main form of income during the beginning of her music career. On October 30, 2014, Monet released her debut EP Nightmares & Lullabies: Act 1 and on June 17, 2015, she released her follow-up EP Nightmares & Lullabies – Act 2 under Atlantic Records. Monet chose the name as it represented the sound of the EPs: a dark beat mixed with soft melodies. 2016–2018: Life After Love and touring Following the shootings of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile, and the Dallas Police shooting, Monét released \\"Better Days\\" with Ariana Grande on July 10, 2016. Monét joined girl group Fifth Harmony on the North American leg of the 7/27 Tour, which began on July 25, 2016, as an opening act along with pop singer JoJo. Grande joined Monet on one of the tour dates to perform \\"Better Days.\\" On September 22, 2016, Grande announced on Twitter that Monét will serve as an opening act along with British girl group Little Mix on the North American leg of the Dangerous Woman Tour. Monét also supported Grande on the European leg of the tour alongside rapper Bia. In 2016, Monét released the promotional single \\"Do You Like It\\" which was followed by the single \\"Ready\\", which was released while on tour with Ariana Grande in April 2017. Both singles would later be included on Life After Love Pt. 2. On February 23, 2018, Monét released the first half of her \\"Life After Love\\" series, Life After Love, Pt. 1. The project features the single \\"Freak\\", which was released on February 9 with the project's pre-order. A remix of the song featuring previous tour-mate Bia, was released on July 19, 2018 alongside a music video. The latter half of the \\"Life After Love\\" series, Life After Love, Pt. 2, was released on September 28, 2018, and was preceded by the single \\"New Love\\". 2019–present: Jaguar On April 1, 2019, Victoria Monét and Ariana Grande released the single \\"Monopoly\\" while Ariana Grande was on her Sweetener World Tour. In late 2019, Monét released the single \\"Ass Like That\\". The song served as the lead single to her upcoming debut project. In early 2020, Monét released the single \\"Moment\\" followed by the promotional single \\"Dive\\". Monét was announced as Apple Music's Up Next artist in February 2020. On June 19, Monét released the single \\"Experience\\" with Khalid and SG Lewis and announced her debut project, Jaguar. In an interview with Apple Music, Monét disclosed that Jaguar will be released in three separate parts which will eventually come together to form her debut studio album. Part one of Jaguar was released on August 7. On October 4, Monét released the song \\"Politics\\" exclusively on SoundCloud, leaving a portion of the song fully instrumental, so listeners could add their own feature verse to the song. On October 8, Monét released a remix of the Jaguar track \\"Touch Me\\" featuring American singer-songwriter Kehlani. ==Songwriting== Monét has a long history of writing songs for other artists. In 2010, she helped pen \\"I Hate That You Love Me\\" by Diddy Dirty Money and went on to co-write songs such as \\"Be Alright\\", \\"Let Me Love You\\" and \\"Thank U, Next\\" by Ariana Grande; \\"Memories Back Then\\" by T.I., B.o.B and Kendrick Lamar; \\"Drunk Texting\\" by Chris Brown; \\"Everlasting Love\\", \\"Them Girls Be Like\\", \\"Reflection\\", \\"We Know\\", and \\"No Way\\" by Fifth Harmony; \\"You Wouldn't Understand\\" by Nas; \\"Sin City\\" by GOOD Music; \\"Visual Love\\" by Chrisette Michele; \\"Live on Tonight\\" by T.I.; \\"Do It\\" by Chloe x Halle; \\"Rather Be\\" by Brandy; \\"Monopoly\\" by Ariana Grande (featuring Monét); as well as \\"Ice Cream\\" by Blackpink and Selena Gomez. For her work with Grande she was nominated for two awards at the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards, Record of the Year for \\"7 Rings\\" and Album of the Year\\" for Thank U, Next. ==Personal life== Monét came out as bisexual in 2018. ==Discography== Studio albums { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" center;\\" +List of studio albums, with selected details, chart positions and certifications !

The building was vacated by the newspapers in 2013, after a change of ownership in 2012 from Daily Mail and General Trust plc to Local World which resulted in relocation to smaller offices at Milbay in Plymouth, and the building has since stood empty. The owners advertised the building for sale, but, as of 10 April 2015, no buyers had come forward, and the owners served Plymouth City Council with a notice that they wish to demolish the building. Sir Nicholas Grimshaw made his own suggestions as to what use could be made of the building now that it is redundant as a newspaper headquarters and printing press. On 22 July 2015 it was announced that the building had been awarded a Grade II* listing by Historic England]http://www.c20society.org.uk/news/c20-society-success-grimshaws- plymouth-ship-building-listed-grade-ii/ saving it from demolition. ==References *Estate Agent Sales Brochure 2014 *Grimshaw partners website: Western Morning News HQ *Western Morning News website *Evening Herald Website Category:Buildings and structures in Plymouth, Devon Category:Office buildings completed in 1993 Category:Industrial buildings completed in 1993 ","title":"The Ship, Derriford"},{"id":"46374669","text":"The 2015 Epping Forest District Council election took place on 7 May 2015 to elect members of Epping Forest District Council in England.

Police violence resulted in the deaths of at least 16 Tamils and also a high damage to the local property. The Hartley College library was burned down along with its laboratory reminiscent of the Burning of Jaffna library. ==Background== Following the deadly violence against Tamils during the Black July pogrom, that resulted in 3000 deaths of Tamil civilians and widespread migration of tens of thousands out of the country, the Sri Lankan government began to engage in a full-scale war against several of Tamil militant groups who had taken up arms to liberate or acquire greater autonomy in the country's north and east, considered the traditional homeland of the island's Tamil populace. Civilians in the north and east were often subjects to torture, forced disappearances and even extrajudicial killings by the Sri Lankan military and other agencies. ==The incident== On 16 September 1984, four Sri Lankan policemen were killed in combat near Thikkam. The Police responded by shooting between 16 and 18 civilians dead in Point Pedro. Police also burned shops and several Hartley College buildings in retaliation for the attack. ==Aftermath== Government response The National Security Minister stated that 6 to 10 civilians were killed, and a few shops were burned according to government information. The Sri Lankan Government ordered a police investigation and promised that disciplinary action would be taken against those responsible. The Minister, however observed that it was difficult to gather evidence sufficient to support court-martial sanctions. No one was subsequently prosecuted. Violence against schools in Tamil areas Following the massacre and the burning down of the Hartley College buildings, schools and educational institutions in Jaffna District functioned in a climate of fear. Schools in Point Pedro stopped functioning for a long period of time. Several other educational institutions in the region became active and deliberate targets for the Sri Lankan military. ==References== Category:1984 crimes in Sri Lanka Category:Attacks on civilians attributed to the Sri Lanka Police Category:Civilian massacres in Sri Lanka Category:Mass murder in 1984 Category:Mass murder of Sri Lankan Tamils Category:People shot dead by law enforcement officers in Sri Lanka Category:Terrorist incidents in Sri Lanka in 1984 Category:September 1984 events in Asia ","title":"1984 Point Pedro massacre"},{"id":"46374720","text":"Conservatives in blue and Labour in red.

He made his debut as a senior on 20 January 2010, coming on as a second-half substitute in a 0–3 Campeonato Carioca away loss against Fluminense. Galhardo scored his first senior goal on 27 February 2010, netting the second in a 3–0 win at Resende. He finished the tournament with 15 appearances, as his side achieved a mid-table position. After impressing in 2011 Campeonato Carioca, Galhardo joined Brasileirão Série A club Botafogo on 14 April 2011, on loan until December. He made his debut in the category on 22 May, starting in a 0–1 away loss against Palmeiras. On 19 January 2012, Galhardo was loaned to Comercial (Ribeirão Preto) until May. Rarely used by the club, he returned to Bangu and served subsequent loans at América (Natal) and Remo. After having unpaid wages, Galhardo left Remo in June 2013 and returned to Bangu. The following year he represented Boa, Cametá and Brasiliense, appearing sparingly in all of them. On 3 January 2015 Galhardo agreed to a deal at Madureira, and scored five goals and amassed seven assists in 14 matches during the year's Carioca. On 23 April he returned the top tier, signing a three-year deal with Coritiba. Galhardo scored his first goal in the main category on 16 May 2015, netting the first in a 2–0 home win against Grêmio. He contributed with 25 appearances, as his side narrowly avoided relegation. On 20 January 2016, Galhardo was loaned to Red Bull Brasil until the end of 2016 Campeonato Paulista. On 6 January 2017, Galhardo was loaned to Albirex Niigata until the end of 2017 season. But he was forced to return to his country cause of the trouble with his team mates. Actually, he was irritated by the team's situation (warst place in J1 league). In April 2019, he joined Ceará. On January 8 2020 he signed for one year with Internacional. ==Personal life== Galhardo's younger brother, Gabriel, is also a footballer and a midfielder.

The station runs pop and rock music from the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s, however in 2017, as the new show schedule was launched, the music format shifted towards so-called timeless hits which also includes recurrents. The station can be compared with Absolute Radio in the United Kingdom. Radio Veronica in its present form was created on August 31, 2003 by a merger of the cable station Radio Veronica of the Vereniging Veronica and the golden oldie station Radio 103 of Sky Radio Ltd. In return, received the Vereniging Veronica 3.5% of the shares of the Sky Radio Ltd. in hands. In 2006, this interest was expanded to 10%, after the Telegraaf Media Groep NV and ING acquired the Sky Radio Group and those in Sienna Holding BV - operating under the name Sky Radio Group accommodated. In 2007, the Telegraaf Media Groep NV acquired 85% (now 22.85%) of the company owned and thus control over the company. The brand \\"Radio Veronica\\" has a long heritage in the Netherlands going back to the offshore station (VRON) in the 1960s and early 1970s later becoming (as VOO) part of the Dutch public broadcasting system before once again becoming a private venture however the station/brand has undergone several changes of ownership since. Radio Veronica is comparable to Sky Radio by their similarity of decades (1980s - today). The only difference is that Sky do not play any \\"rock\\" music. ==Fluctuations== Uunco Cerfontaine was since 2003 the program director of the station. Early 2013 was Niels Hoogland appointed as program director. On November 4, 2013 the station was a new course. This meant the dismissal of Erwin Peters, Bart van Leeuwen, Luc van Rooij and Dennis Hoebee. The change did not achieve a higher market share. Between January 2013 and October 2014, the market share decreased by 2%. Also Rob van Someren was replaced in autumn 2014 by Jeroen van Inkel. Niels Hoogland was replaced on November 1, 2014 by Erik de Zwart. Erik de Zwart presented on February 2, 2015 a new programming. In this new course old items, such as \\"De Stemband\\", \\"De plaat en zijn verhaal\\" and Veronica FM program \\"Rinkeldekinkel\\" returned. The design of the station appears again in the eighties, but adapted to the present time. Further De Zwart took the DJs Bart Van Leeuwen and Dennis Hoebee back. == Charts == Current * Top 1000 allertijden * Album Top 1000 allertijden * 80s Top 880 * 90s Top 590 * 00s Top 500 * Top 500 van de 21ste eeuw * Top 40 Hitdossier * RockHits Top 500 * Download Top 1000 allertijden Former * De Download Top 750 * 70s Top 270 * Soulshow Top 100 == Spin-off stations == Radio Veronica also broadcast a number of spin-off stations which are available only via the Internet: * Veronica Top 1000 Allertijden * Veronica Rock Radio * Veronica Hit Radio * Radio Veronica 80's Hits * Radio Veronica 90's Hits * Radio Veronica Drive-in Show * Veronica Comedy Radio * Wave Radio * Flower Power Radio * Baars Classic Rock * Radio 192 * Buma Rocks ==Logos== File:Radio Veronica logo 2003.gifUsed from August 31, 2003 to November 16, 2005 File:Logo Radio Veronica.pngUsed from November 17, 2005 to April 30, 2010 File:Radio- Veronica-logo.pngUsed from May 1, 2010 to November 18, 2014 File:RadioVeronica-logo.pngUsed from November 19, 2014 to September 30, 2018 File:Veronicatvlogo.pngUsed Since October 1, 2018 ==See also== * List of radio stations in the Netherlands ==References External links == * Category:Radio stations in the Netherlands Category:Mass media in Naarden ","title":"Radio Veronica (Talpa Radio)"},{"id":"46374862","text":"Soumya Sankar Bose is an Indian documentary photographer. In his practice he uses photography, archival material, text and film to explore desire, identity and memory. His first book 'Where the Birds Never Sing(2020)' is on Marichjhapi massacre, the forcible eviction in 1979 of lower caste Bengali refugees on Marichjhapi Island in Sundarban, West Bengal, and the subsequent death of thousands by police gunfire, starvation, and disease. The Book was shortlisted for First Photobook award in the Paris Photo–Aperture Foundation PhotoBook Awards 2020. ==Life and work== Soumya Sankar Bose is an independent documentary photographer, born and brought up in Midnapore, West Bengal India. His long term project on retired Jatra (Bengal) artistes had been funded by India Foundation for the Arts. His work has appeared in The New York Times,The Caravan, The Huffington Post, BBC, The Indian Express,The Telegraph,NPR and many more . Bose's work \\"Let's Sing an Old Song\\" explores concepts of nostalgia, modernity, performativity and the transformation of art in a changing world, his work both creates and documents reality. His portraits of Jatra artists are staged spectacles that evoke not only the tragedy of this waning tradition, but also those of its practitioners. Using photography as a performative medium rather than documentary tool, Bose brings an original approach to an often photographically explored space of dying art form in India. Immersing the viewer in a surreal universe is crucial to Bose’s project \\"Full moon on a Dark Night.\\" By way of those portraits, Bose conducts a psychological exploration of a community of individuals who have been relentlessly persecuted by society because of their identities and their gender or sexual orientations. The work looks closely at the LGBT community in eastern India through a fantastical lens, often projecting a world devoid of restrictive laws and social taboos that the community regularly comes up against. Other images in the work are responses to these very constraints imposed by the state and society. It is here that Bose makes use of visual metaphors—a gas mask, a tiger in the wild, a choppy sea engulfing a man struggling against the current—to evoke notions of censorship and surveillance and feelings of suffocation and anxiety. ==Awards & Fellowships== * 2020- The Foundation for Indian Contemporary Art's Amol Vadehra Art Grant. * 2020- The Agroecology Fund in collaboration with Magnum Foundation. * 2019- Goethe- Insitut / Max Mueller Bhavan's Five Million Incidents. * 2019- World Press Photo's Joop Swart Masterclass. * 2019- India foundation for the Arts' Photo Book grant. * 2018- Magnum Foundation & Henry Luce Foundation's Migration & Relegion grant . * 2017- Magnum Foundation’s Photography and Social Justice Fellowship. * 2015 & 17- India foundation for the Arts grant under the Arts Practice Programme. * 2015- The Toto-Tasveer Emerging Photographer of the Year. == References Interview NPR, June, 2019 Category:People from Midnapore Category:Living people Category:1990 births Category:Indian portrait photographers Category:Documentary photographers Category:21st-century Indian photographers Category:Bengali artists Category:Indian contemporary artists ","title":"Soumya Sankar Bose"},{"id":"46374872","text":"Panegyra micans is a species of moth of the family Tortricidae.

Bellinger was drafted by the Dodgers in the fourth round of the 2013 Major League Baseball draft, and made his MLB debut in 2017. He was named an All-Star and the National League's Rookie of the Year in 2017, and won the National League Most Valuable Player Award in 2019. Bellinger is the son of Clay Bellinger, who also played in MLB. ==Early life== Bellinger was born in Scottsdale, Arizona. He grew up a New York Yankees fan. Bellinger played in the 2007 Little League World Series for the Chandler, Arizona team and played high school baseball at Hamilton High School in Chandler. He was a 2013 Rawlings-Perfect Game 2nd Team All-American. While known primarily for his hitting ability, Bellinger also pitched for his high school and threw a four-hit, complete-game shutout with 10 strikeouts in a national tournament. ==Professional career== Minor leagues Bellinger as a member of the Tulsa Drillers Bellinger was drafted by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the fourth round of the 2013 Major League Baseball draft and signed with them on June 13, 2013, for a $700,000 signing bonus, despite a verbal commitment to play college baseball at the University of Oregon. He made his professional debut with the Arizona League Dodgers, batting .210 in 195 plate appearances. He had some difficulty making contact in his first pro season, striking out 46 times in 47 games but scouts said he showed promise and had much power potential. In 2014, he was promoted to the Ogden Raptors of the Pioneer League and despite dealing with a shoulder injury early in the summer he hit .328 in 46 games for the Raptors. He played in 2015 with the Rancho Cucamonga Quakes and was selected to the mid-season California League all-star team as well as the post-season all-star team. In 128 games, he hit .264 with 30 homers (tied for 2nd in the league), leading the league in runs (97) and RBIs (103). He was given a non- roster invitation to Dodgers spring training in 2016. Bellinger was assigned to the Double-A Tulsa Drillers in the Texas League to start the 2016 season. In 114 games for Tulsa he hit .263 with 23 homers (3rd in the league), 59 walks (tied for 3rd in the league), and 65 RBIs (9th in the league), earning him a late-season promotion to the Triple-A Oklahoma City Dodgers, where he had six hits in 11 at bats (.545 average) and three home runs. Bellinger was assigned to the Glendale Desert Dogs of the Arizona Fall League after the season and he participated in the Fall Stars Game of top prospects in the league. Bellinger began the 2017 season with Oklahoma City and was called up to the majors for the first time on April 25, 2017. Los Angeles Dodgers 2017: NL Rookie of the Year and World Series 2017 Los Angeles Dodgers Bellinger started in left field in his major league debut on April 25, 2017, against the San Francisco Giants, and had one hit in three at-bats, with an intentional walk. He was just the third Dodgers player in history to be intentionally walked in his debut (Chico Fernández, Dick Nen). Bellinger's first major league hit was an infield single off Neil Ramírez in the ninth inning of the same game. Bellinger hit his first major league home run on April 29 off Zach Eflin of the Philadelphia Phillies and followed that by hitting a second home run in the same game, this one off Héctor Neris. He was just the third Dodgers player with a two–home-run game among his first five starts, joining Charlie Gilbert (1940) and Yasiel Puig (2013). He hit his first grand slam on May 6, off Miguel Díaz of the San Diego Padres, as part of a career-high five RBI day. He was the first Dodgers player to hit five home runs within his first 11 games. Bellinger was named the National League Player of the Week for the first week of May. With nine home runs in May, Bellinger moved into a three-way tie with Joc Pederson (May 2015) and James Loney (September 2007) for most home runs by a Dodgers rookie in a calendar month. He was named the National League Rookie of the Month for May. Bellinger hit two home runs against the Cincinnati Reds on June 11, then did so again in the Dodgers' next game—on June 13, against the Cleveland Indians—to become the first Dodgers player to hit two home runs in back-to-back games since Adrián Beltré in the 2004 season and he had four multi–home-run games in his first 45 games, becoming the fastest player in MLB history to accomplish that, besting Bob Horner who did so in 63 games in 1978. He again hit two home runs in a game on June 19, against the New York Mets, and in the process tied Wally Berger and Gary Sánchez for the fastest players to hit 20 home runs. On June 20, Bellinger became the first rookie in MLB history with 10 home runs in a 10-game span. He had his sixth multi–home-run game on June 25, against the Colorado Rockies, passing Mike Piazza to set a new Dodgers rookie record. He won his second player of the week award for his work that week. Bellinger was named to the 2017 Major League Baseball All-Star Game as a reserve. He also competed in the Home Run Derby, advancing to the second round before falling to the eventual champion Aaron Judge. On July 15, he hit for the cycle against the Miami Marlins, the first rookie in franchise history to do so. On September 2, he hit his 35th home run of the season to tie Mike Piazza for the Dodgers rookie record. He broke the record the following day. He tied Wally Berger and Frank Robinson for the National League record when he hit his 38th home run on September 16. He hit his 39th on September 22 against the San Francisco Giants. In his first season in the majors, Bellinger played in 132 games with a .267 batting average, 39 home runs, and 97 RBI. He was selected as the Sporting News NL Rookie of the Year. He played in all 15 of the Dodgers games in the post-season, with a .219 batting average, three home runs and nine RBI. He also struck out 29 times in 64 at-bats. In Game 5 of the 2017 World Series, Bellinger came to bat in the fifth inning, and with two Dodgers on base, hit a home run. The three-run-home run temporarily put the Dodgers in the lead. He set the MLB record for most strikeouts in one postseason with 29 strikeouts, 17 strikeouts in the World Series alone. After the season, he was unanimously voted as the National League Rookie of the Year.  2018: NLCS MVP and World Series  Bellinger played in 162 of the 163 games of the Dodgers' 2018 regular season, appearing at first base (110 games, 85 starts), center field (78 games, 50 starts), right field (5 games) and left field (1 game). He led the team in hits (145) and multi-hit games (41), slashing .260/.343/.470 with a .814 OPS and 25 home runs, 7 triples, 28 doubles, 76 RBIs, and 14 stolen bases. He hit his first home run of the 2018 season on April 1, 2018, which was the 40th of his career, a milestone he reached in just 136 games, the third fewest games needed to hit 40 home runs, trailing Rudy York (129) and Mark McGwire (110) according to STATS, LLC. During the June 5–7 series against the Pittsburgh Pirates at PNC Park, Bellinger hit home runs in each of the 3 games of the series, then hit another home run against the Atlanta Braves at Dodger Stadium the following day, June 8, to complete 4 home runs in 4 consecutive games for the first time in his career. In the 2018 National League West tie-breaker game on October 1, Bellinger hit a 2 run home run in the bottom of the 4th inning. Bellinger appeared in all 12 of the Dodgers' Postseason games and was named the 2018 NLCS MVP after his 13th inning walk-off single in Game 4 and his go-ahead two run home run in the second inning of game 7 in the Dodgers defeat of the Milwaukee Brewers to win the 2018 National League Pennant.  2019: NL MVP  Bellinger got off to a hot start in 2019, and on April 26 he hit his 13th home run of the season and set a new MLB record with 88 total bases before the month of May, a record previously set by Chase Utley with the 2008 Phillies. He also passed Matt Kemp for the Dodgers record for most home runs in that span. His 97 total bases, 37 RBI and 47 hits all established new major league records for before May 1, while his 14 home runs and 32 runs scored tied MLB records. He earned his first Player of the Month award in April 2019. Bellinger carried a .400 batting average into mid-May and finished the first half in the top 5 in the NL in average, home runs, RBI, on-base percentage, slugging percentage, and OPS. He was voted as the right fielder for the National League in the 2019 All Star game and set a new Dodgers franchise record with 30 home runs before the All-Star Game. Bellinger was ejected for the first time in his career on July 24 by home plate umpire Dan Iassogna for arguing balls and strikes. On August 2, Bellinger hit his 100th career home run off of Eric Lauer of the San Diego Padres. By doing so, he became the fastest player in Dodgers history to accomplish that feat. He did it in his 401st game, surpassing Mike Piazza who took 422 games to get there. On August 15, at just 24 years old he became the youngest player in Dodgers history to hit 40 home runs in a season. Bellinger finished the regular season with a .305 batting average, 47 home runs, and 115 RBI, all career highs. He led the major leagues in WAR (9.0) and intentional walks (21). On defense in 2019, he had a 19 Defensive Runs Saved (DRS) rating, the best in the major leagues among right fielders. After the season, Bellinger was awarded the Fielding Bible Award for both right field and multi- positional categories, the first Dodger outfielder to win the award and the first player to win two in the same season. He also won the Rawlings Gold Glove Award for right field. He also won the Silver Slugger Award, becoming just the fifth Dodgers player in history to win both a Gold Glove and a Silver Slugger in the same season. Bellinger also was voted the NL MVP. 2020: World Series After the 2019 season, Bellinger agreed to a $11.5 million, one-year contract with the Dodgers for the 2020 season. That contract set a new MLB record for a player in his first year of arbitration. The 2020 season was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The shortened 60-game season began on July 23. Bellinger hit .239/.333/.455 (all career lows) with 12 homers and 30 RBIs in 56 games. In Game 7 of the NLCS, Bellinger hit a go-ahead solo home run that propelled the Dodgers into the 2020 World Series; the team’s third appearance in the Fall Classic in four years. ==Awards and honors== *Arizona Fall League Fall Stars Game participant (2016) *California League Mid-Season All-Star (2015) *California League Post-Season All-Star (2015) *Fielding Bible Award (Right Field) (2019) *Fielding Bible Award (Multi-positional) (2019) *Los Angeles Sports Council Sportsman of the Year (2017) *2× National League All-Star (2017, 2019) *National League Championship Series MVP (2018) *National League Most Valuable Player Award (2019) *3× National League Player of the Week (May 1–7, 2017, June 19–25, 2017, April 1–7, 2019) *2× National League Rookie of the Month (May 2017, June 2017) *National League Rookie of the Year Award (2017) *Players Choice National League Outstanding Rookie (2017) *Rawlings Gold Glove Award (2019) *Silver Slugger Award (2019) *Sporting News NL Rookie of the Year (2017) *Topps All-Star Rookie Team (2017) ==Personal life== Clay, in 2019 Bellinger's family is of French, German, and Greek heritage and his father, Clay, played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the New York Yankees and Anaheim Angels.

Abraham understands that everything on this trip has changed too, even himself, completely tied to Japanese culture and not to the West, the friends and especially the city, which has become a thematic park where it is very difficult to hear someone speaking Catalan. The most interesting of all is how this novel is written, first with narrator in third person who observes his characters, so that even as we find him as a character in the novel, as a private detective who follows them and at one point explains us the reason for writing this text. We also find sentences in first person with the characters narrating their views. These effects give great polyphony in the novel and they are a resource of great interest. == Notes  Bibliography == * == External links == * Web page of Night of Santa Llúcia Category:Living people Category:Catalan writers Category:Catalan painters Category:1948 births Category:Catalan-language writers ","title":"Joaquim Pijoan i Arbocer"},{"id":"46375253","text":"The Copa del Generalísimo 1956 Final was the 54th final of the King's Cup.

It is approximately long and flows through Madison Township. The watershed of the creek has an area of . The creek is considered to be Class A Wild Trout Waters. A planned trail is in its vicinity. The surficial geology in the area consists of alluvium, bedrock, peat bogs, wetlands, Boulder Colluvium, and Wisconsinan Till. ==Course== Kellum Creek begins in a broad and shallow valley in Madison Township. It flows south for several tenths of a mile before turning west and then south again. After a few tenths of a mile, the creek reaches the community of Aberdeen and turns west for more than a mile, flowing through a much narrower valley. It then turns northwest for a short distance before reaching its confluence with Roaring Brook at the southern tip of the Elmhurst Reservoir. Kellum Creek joins Roaring Brook upstream of its mouth. ==Hydrology, geography, and geology== The elevation near the mouth of Kellum Creek is above sea level. The elevation of the creek's source is between above sea level. The surficial geology along the valley floor of Kellum Creek in its lower reaches mainly consists of Boulder Colluvium (which contains numerous quartz, sandstone, or conglomerate boulders) and alluvium. Bedrock containing conglomeratic sandstone, sandstone, and shale occurs on the sides of the valley and a glacial or resedimented till known as Wisconsinan Till also occurs in the area. Further upstream, the surficial geology in the creek's vicinity consists mainly of Wisconsinan Till, with some patches of bedrock, Boulder Colluvium, peat bogs, and wetlands. The concentration of alkalinity in Kellum Creek is 20 milligrams per liter. ==Watershed== The watershed of Kellum Creek has an area of . The mouth of the creek is in the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Moscow. However, its source is in the quadrangle of Sterling. ==History and recreation== Kellum Creek was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1178331. In the early 2000s, the Lackawanna River Watershed Conservation Plan recommended that Madison Township include protection of Kellum Creek in their zoning plans. A bridge carries State Route 2004/Reservoir Road over the creek. Its replacement has been proposed. Land along the creek was historically owned by the Theta Land Corporation. However, they opened the creek and many others in the area to the public in 2002 by leasing the surrounding land to the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission for $1 per year. A trail crossing Kellum Creek on its path from Pennsylvania American Water lands in Roaring Brook Township to a location near the sewer plant in Mosvow in the North Pocono region has been planned. The trail will be known as the Roaring Creek Trail and will be long. Construction was slated for 2014 and part of the funding was supplied by the Pennsylvania Environmental Council. The crossing of Kellum Creek is planned to be as natural as possible and contain no bridges, only a rock crossing. ==Biology== Wild trout naturally reproduce in Kellum Creek from its upper reaches downstream to its mouth. The creek is also considered by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission to be Class A Wild Trout Waters for brook trout. ==See also== *White Oak Run (Roaring Brook), next tributary of Roaring Brook going downstream *Van Brunt Creek, next tributary of Roaring Brook going upstream *List of rivers of Pennsylvania *List of tributaries of the Lackawanna River ==References== Category:Rivers of Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania Category:Tributaries of Roaring Brook (Lackawanna River) Category:Rivers of Pennsylvania ","title":"Kellum Creek"},{"id":"46375419","text":"The 2015 Ball State Cardinals football team represented Ball State University in the 2015 NCAA Division I FBS football season.

As Staudt states when discussing the roadmap of the book, “The book contains conceptual, empirical and strategic analyses of interest to multiple audiences concerned with violence, borders, activism, and women and gender.” She does this by composing a review on existing knowledge of violence to women in Cuidad Juarez, showing data surveys from the survivors of violence in the city, looking at who exactly are the victims, how they reacted, their reasoning to how the violence happened and how much do they fear for their safety in their home. Chapter Four is more concerned to how activism from local and transnational feminist organizations spread awareness to the violent situation in the border city with its biggest protest in 2004 bringing in approximately 5,000 to 8,000 people to protest against femicide (the murders of women being unsolved and ignored by local law enforcement). This was the peak of the movement but it did bring necessary change as law enforcement in Ciudad Juarez did step up to the concerns of the community and the activists of human rights groups. Chapter Five is where Staudt looks at the changes and provides an analysis if it is just weak attempts to try and calm activists and community members of their concerns. There has been better enforcement than before but the situation is still very much a depressing one for the safety of women in Ciudad Juarez. One conclusion that Staudt makes in her book is how neoliberal economic policy has created an environment beside the United States where there are large maquiladoras that provide massive employment but with only 25-50 dollars a week being paid to these workers, putting many in the city into poverty. Violence is more likely in poverty since there is lack of control and added stress of being in poverty. This is why there's greater numbers of violence below the poverty line. Add that with the law enforcement in Ciudad Juarez not being concerned about the well being of women in the city, having a culture of violence to women being the norm. With activism having put more pressure towards the government, Staudt shows the changes the government has made could be much better but many Mexican politicians and bureaucrats have been timid in making too much changes in fear of angering the male population in, making the changes for women's safety in Mexico to be slow but steady. ==References== Category:Books about Mexico Category:Violence against women in Mexico ","title":"Violence and Activism At The Border"},{"id":"46375730","text":"Mountain Dew is a lostThe Library of Congress American Silent Feature Film Survival Catalog: Mountain Dew 1917 American silent comedy-drama film directed by Thomas N.

The game was played on Monday, April 4, 2016, at NRG Stadium in Houston, Texas, between the Villanova Wildcats and the North Carolina Tar Heels. The first half was closely fought, with neither team leading by more than five points in the first 19 minutes. After North Carolina briefly took a seven-point lead in the final minute, a field goal by Phil Booth for Villanova cut the lead to 39–34 at the break. Villanova started to gain the upper hand in the second half, taking their largest lead of the game, 67–57, with 4:47 remaining. North Carolina then surged back, setting up a heroic comeback in the final minutes. With just over 1:30 remaining, Marcus Paige hit a three pointer to cut the lead to three points. After Villanova turned over the ball, Brice Johnson cut the lead to one point. Booth was fouled and hit two free throws to retake a three-point lead. With 13 seconds remaining, the lead was again three points for Villanova. On the ensuing possession, Paige sunk an off-balance three- point field goal to tie the game with 4.7 seconds left. However, Ryan Arcidiacono found Kris Jenkins for a buzzer-beating, championship-winning three-point shot, with Villanova defeating North Carolina by a final score of 77–74. ==Participants== Villanova After a 27–4 regular season and winning the 2016 Big East Conference regular season championship, Villanova beat Georgetown and Providence en route to the 2016 Big East Tournament Finals, where they would lose to Seton Hall. They were the #2 seed in the South Regional of the 2016 NCAA Tournament. Villanova cruised past UNC Asheville in the first round of the 2016 NCAA Tournament with an 86–56 victory. In the second round, Villanova routed Iowa by a score of 87–68 to reach the Sweet 16 for the first time since 2009. In the South Regional Semifinals, Villanova blew out Miami by a score of 92–69. In the South regional Final, with Villanova leading 62–59, Mikal Bridges made a steal before Frank Mason III could shoot a potential game-tying three-pointer, and Jalen Brunson made the ensuing free throws and Villanova beat the #1-overall seed Kansas 64–59 to advance to the Final Four for the first time since 2009. In the 2016 Final Four, Villanova defeated Oklahoma, 95–51, the largest margin of victory in Final Four history, to advance to the National Championship Game for the first time since their 1985 National Championship run. The game also featured the second-best shooting percentage in a Final Four game, behind only Villanova's 1985 Championship Game performance of 78.6% (22-for-28). North Carolina After a 25–6 regular season and winning the 2016 ACC regular season championship, North Carolina beat Pittsburgh, Notre Dame, and Virginia en route to the ACC Tournament Championship. They were rewarded with the top seed in the East Regional of the 2016 NCAA Tournament. North Carolina opened the 2016 NCAA Tournament with an 83–67 win over Florida Gulf Coast, outscoring FGCU 42–27 in the second half. North Carolina would again use a big second half to beat Providence, 85–66, in the second round, outscoring the Friars 51–36 in the second half to advance to the Sweet 16.

In the last minute of the half, North Carolina briefly went up by seven points, and had a chance to go up by nine. However, Villanova's Josh Hart blocked a layup attempt, which led to a Phil Booth jump shot at the other end of the court, cutting the deficit to 39–34 as the clock expired. At halftime, Joel Berry II of the Tar Heels led all players with 15 points. Despite entering the game ranked only 294th out of all 351 Division I teams in three-point shooting, North Carolina hit seven of their nine three-point attempt in the first half. However, the Tar Heels hit just 32% of their two-point attempts. Villanova had the edge in points the paint by an 18–12 margin, connecting on 65% on their two-point shots. The Tar Heels led in fast break points by a 10–2 margin and collected five offensive rebounds compared to only one for Villanova. Villanova's Kris Jenkins played just four minutes in the half after getting into early foul trouble. After the halftime break, Villanova went on a 13–2 run and reclaimed the lead. With 6:13 left in the second half, Ryan Arcidiacono of the Wildcats hit a three-point field goal to give his team a lead of six points. With 4:47 to go, Villanova was up by a game-high 10 points, leading 67–57. However, North Carolina fought back with two straight field goals. With 1:38 remaining, Villanova led 70–64 before Marcus Paige of the Tar Heels hit a three-pointer to cut the lead in half. After a Villanova turnover, Brice Johnson hit a bank shot to cut the Wildcats' lead to one point. Phil Booth of the Wildcats was fouled by Isaiah Hicks with 35.7 seconds left. He hit both free throws to put the lead back to three points. Paige missed a layup attempt on the ensuing possession, but North Carolina got the rebound and Paige made a reverse layup to cut the lead back to one. Villanova's Josh Hart was then fouled and hit both free throws. Down by three points, North Carolina tied the game on an \\"unbelievable\\" double-clutch three- pointer by Paige with 4.7 seconds remaining. After the game, North Carolina Coach Roy Williams remarked \\"he turned a broken play into a great play\\". Villanova then called a time-out to set up their final play, one that they had practiced \\"every single day\\" during the season, called \\"Nova\\". After receiving the in-bounds pass, Arcidiacono passed with less than two seconds to Jenkins, who hit a game-winning, buzzer-beating three-point shot. It was the first buzzer-beating shot to win an NCAA men's national title since Lorenzo Charles' dunk for North Carolina State University in 1983, and the first title game ever to end on a buzzer-beating three-pointer. \\"Kris Jenkins lives for that moment\\", remarked his coach Jay Wright. Paige finished with a game-high 21 points and a game-high 6 assists for North Carolina. Berry added 20 points for the Tar Heels and Johnson scored 14 while collecting a game-high 8 rebounds. Booth came off the bench to lead Villanova with a career-high 20 points. Arcidiacono scored 16, Jenkins added 14, and Hart had 12 points and 8 rebounds. As a team, Villanova finished 28 of 48 from the field (58%) and 8 of 14 from three (57%). North Carolina made 11 of 17 three-point attempts (65%) and was 27 of 63 overall (43%). The Tar Heels won the rebounding battle 33–23, including 14 offensive rebounds to just two for Villanova. The teams combined for just 21 turnovers. It was Villanova's second NCAA championship. Their first championship was in the 1985 Championship Game, when they defeated the Georgetown Hoyas in what is often considered one of the greatest upsets of all time. Rollie Massimino, the head coach of the 1985 Wildcats, was on hand to watch the 2016 Championship Game. The Wildcats finished the tournament with the second-largest average margin of victory in tournament history, behind only the 1996 Kentucky team. ==Broadcast calls on the final shotReactions== Villanova coach Jay Wright called the victory \\"one of the greatest college basketball games we've ever been a part of\\". In his post-game press conference, Jay Wright remarked, \\"That was one of the greatest college basketball games we've ever been a part of. I just couldn't be prouder, couldn't be happier to see them fulfill this. This is what it's all about as a coach\\". He added, \\"I can’t wait to see that look (on my face), because I was just shocked\\" by the final play. \\"We beat a class program. Great coach and great team. We have a lot of respect for North Carolina\\". Roy Williams, who was in tears after the game, described his reaction as the final shot went in: \\"It was helpless. It was not a good feeling\\". He added, \\"I'm not very good because I can't take away the hurt ... I told them I loved them. I told them I wish I could have helped them more\\". CBS sportswriter Matt Norlander described the game as \\"a thrilling, undeniably heart-stopping, instant classic of a title game\\". ESPN staff writer Eamonn Brennan also called the game an \\"instant classic\\" and said both teams \\"were flying around the floor, playing high- level, pinpoint basketball and trading great plays\\". The Associated Press called the final basket \\"as memorable as any [points] that have been scored in the history of this tournament\\". Writing for USA Today, Nicole Auerbach called Villanova's performance \\"one of the most improbable and offensively insane NCAA tournament runs\\", ending with \\"one of the most thrilling championship games in tournament history\\". Villanova's championship win was so unexpected that more contestants in ESPN's Tournament Challenge bracket contest picked Villanova to lose in the first round than picked them to win the championship. In response to the historic win and to combat absenteeism the following day, classes at Villanova were cancelled. ==Media coverage== The National Championship game was broadcast in the United States by TBS, marking the first time that the national championship game aired exclusively on pay television, and ending a 34-year run on CBS (CBS and TBS will alternate broadcasting the championship game every other year through 2024; thus, the game returned to CBS for 2017). TBS's sister channels TNT and TruTV aired special broadcasts of the game known as Team Stream powered by Bleacher Report, which featured commentators representing the two participating teams. These special telecasts had been used for the Final Four since they moved to TBS in 2014, but this marked the first time they were used for the national championship. On the main broadcast, Jim Nantz was on play-by-play, with Bill Raftery and Grant Hill providing on-court commentary. Tracy Wolfson was the on-court reporter. Craig Sager was also on hand, as he interviewed former North Carolina guard, Chicago Bulls legend, and Basketball Hall of Famer Michael Jordan, who was in attendance. Greg Gumbel and Ernie Johnson Jr. served as the pregame hosts. Charles Barkley, Seth Davis, Reggie Miller, Clark Kellogg, Kenny Smith and Steve Smith provided commentary. TNT's \\"Team Stream\\", focusing on North Carolina, was called by Wes Durham with analyst Brendan Haywood and sideline reporter Dwayne Ballen, while on truTV's \\"Team Stream\\", which focused on Villanova, Scott Graham called the game with analyst Brian Finneran and sideline reporter Kacie McDonnell. When it was first revealed that TBS would air this game, some concerns arose as to whether the traditional closing song, One Shining Moment, would be used due to its association with CBS, but TBS eventually played it to end the telecast, and continues to do so when it has the broadcasting rights to the Final Four and national championship. ESPN International owned the international broadcast rights. Sean McDonough served as the play-by-play announcer for the international audience, with Dick Vitale providing commentary. In Canada, the game aired on TSN. Radio coverage in the United States was provided by Westwood One, with Kevin Kugler calling the game. The Championship Game was also streamed live on NCAA.com free of charge. With the switch from broadcast television to cable television, ratings in the United States sharply declined from the 2015 title contest between Duke and Wisconsin. The three cable channels airing the game, TBS, TNT and TruTV, had a combined broadcast average of 17.8 million viewers. That total is down from the 28.3 million who watched the previous year's Championship Game, which aired exclusively on CBS. ==References== NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship Game Category:NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship Games Category:North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball Category:Villanova Wildcats men's basketball Category:Basketball in Houston Category:College sports in Texas Category:Sports competitions in Houston Category:April 2016 sports events in the United States NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship Game Category:2016 in Houston ","title":"2016 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship Game"},{"id":"46375792","text":"Highroad Academy is a private K–12 Christian school located in Chilliwack, British Columbia, Canada.

It is the only stone house in the area. with Early owners of the house were area speculators that included Laurel Summers, who platted the town of Parkhurst, which is now a part of Le Claire, James Eads and Lyman Smith. Other owners include farmer Henry Stone, who settled in Scott County in 1844 and owned the house from 1866 to 1877. He was followed by L.G. and Phoebe Condit, also farmers, who lived in the house with a hired farm worker from 1877 to 1881. Henry and Emma Parmelee, who was the Condits' daughter, lived in the house with Phoebe Condit from about 1885. They sold the house to the Hurd family in 1892 and they owned it as late as 1920. ==Architecture== The structure is a vernacular early settlement-era structure. The exterior walls are composed of random ashlar blocks of limestone. The building follows a rectangular plan. It is capped with a hipped roof with a ridge. All of the windows have stone sills and lintels, and the doors are capped with transoms. The house is situated on a sloping lot so the basement on the east elevation is exposed.

Day made appearances in videos on Børns' Vevo channel, and in turn has included him in videos of her own, such as her in DayxDay series for example. The two were previously roommates. Before the release of his first album Dopamine, Børns moved to Los Angeles, where he still resides as of January 2018. Børns is vegetarian like other members of his family. In September 2018, Børns was accused of sexual misconduct by several young women, leading to a Washington D.C. music festival named All Things Go Fall Classic dropping him from its lineup. The allegations against Børns included manipulation, grooming, and sexual aggression toward underaged fans, with the youngest accuser detailing her account of the abuse which began when she was 16 years old. Børns released a statement calling the allegations \\"disturbing and false\\", also saying that \\"All of the relationships I have had were legal and consensual. They ended abruptly and that obviously caused hurt feelings, but for anyone to suggest anything beyond that is irresponsible.\\" ==Discography== * Dopamine (2015) * Blue Madonna (2018) == Concert tours == ;Headlining * Dopamine Tour (2015) * Summer Tour 2016 (2016) * Fall 2017 Tour (2017) * Money Man Tour (2017–18) * Fruit of Dreams Tour (2018–19) ;Supporting * MisterWives – Our Own House Tour (2015) * Charli XCX & Bleachers – Charli and Jack Do America Tour (2015) * Years & Years - Fall 2015 Tour (2015) * Halsey – Badlands Tour (2016) * The Lumineers – Cleopatra World Tour (2016) * Mumford & Sons – An Arrow Through the Heartland Tour (2016) * Lana Del Rey – LA to the Moon Tour (2018) ==Filmography== Web {  - !Year !

He was one of the most prominent such figures in his country. ==Biography== Larkin was born with the birth defect spina bifida. He stated that his \\"will to campaign\\" came from \\"the frustrations I experience relating to having a disability\\". He ran for Letterkenny Town Council as a Fine Gael candidate in the 2009 elections, but was unsuccessful. He attended a hearing on disability issues at the European Parliament in 2012. Larkin was elected chairperson of his country's national campaign for disabilities in 2013. He was one of twenty participants from fourteen different countries chosen to attend a conference in Budapest in March 2014. In 2015, Larkin became involved in a dispute with Facebook over posts it decided were not offensive, among which was an advertisement for a spina bifida doll that encouraged the buyer to abuse it. He thought about deleting his account but instead he led a petition against the posts, which was ultimately successful. In 2016, Larkin became involved in a dispute with the makers of Coronation Street over the language used by character David Platt to his grandmother Audrey Roberts in an episode of the TV series. Also that year, he worked on an accessibility guide for his local area. He represented his country at the European Network for Independent Living in Brussels in 2019. Larkin was a sports enthusiast who followed the English association football team Liverpool. Among the issues he spoke out against were being sent two tickets for each football game he attended, one of which he had to pay for and intended for a companion which he did not need; illegal parking in disabled spaces; measures imposed by government on disabled people; discrimination by taxi drivers; and securing parking spaces outside court for disabled people. Larkin died suddenly in hospital in 2020 at the age of 48. He had been active in calling for disability access to polling stations in the weeks before his death. Days before he died, he had been admiring the weather. He was survived by his wife Pauline, his mother Brighdin, his father Frank Snr and his siblings: Louise, Geraldine, Olga, Sharon, Linda, Paul and Gareth. ==See also== * List of disability rights activists ==References== Category:1972 births Category:2020 deaths Category:Disability rights activists from Ireland Category:People from Letterkenny ","title":"Frank Larkin"},{"id":"46376047","text":"The 2015 Central Michigan Chippewas football team represented Central Michigan University in the 2015 NCAA Division I FBS football season.

She took interest in public education and, along with her husband, is credited with having co-founded about 45 educational institutions supported by her family's conglomerate. ==Biography== Sarla Birla was born into a traditional Marwadi Hindu family, the daughter of Gandhian educationist and freedom fighter Brijlal Biyani and his wife Savitri Devi Biyani. She was born in Kuchaman, Rajasthan, at the residence of her maternal grandmother. Her family hailed from Rajasthan, but her father had settled in Akola, Maharashtra, and it was in Akola that Sarla grew up. She studied in a local government school, and the medium of instruction was Marathi. She grew fluent in that language, as also in her mother tongue, the Marwadi dialect of Hindi. English was taught at the school beginning from class six, and Sarla also learned the standard register of the Hindi language at this time. Sarla grew up amid a number of spoken languages, and this made it easy for her to pick up new tongues. At a very advanced age, she made a determination to learn French, a totally new language, and she did pick up a reasonable smattering of that language. In April 1941, she married Basant Kumar Birla, the son of GD Birla, after having been introduced to each other by Jamnalal Bajaj and Mahatma Gandhi. Sarla Birla eventually after this marriage became the matriarch of a large family. They are sometimes referred to as the \\"first couple of Birla empire\\".Unfolding the fascinating story of Birlas, Basant Kumar and Sarala Birla: Life Has No Full Stops released in Delhi, 9 September 2011 They had a son, Aditya Vikram Birla.

Their marriage was an arranged match made by their parents, facilitated by Jamnalal Bajaj and Mahatma Gandhi. Story of one of India's prominent business families, 5 March 2007, MoneyControl Sarala recalled: The Story Of Basant And Sarala Birla, Aaj Tak, 5 April 2015 : \\"I was studying in Pune, Ferguson College, and I got a message that I have to go to Bombay, to Birla house, to see the boy. I went there, I was there for one night and there were so many boys there, I did not know who was who; I stayed there and I came back. After two-three months, I got a call from Gandhiji and my father-in-law telling me to come to Wardha. I went there from Pune and father (Ghanshyam Das Birla) asked me, 'you have seen Basant and you have not yet replied whether you are ready to marry him or not.' I said, 'No, there were eight-ten boys, so I didn't know who was who.' Then I said that I won't marry a boy unless I see him and I know who he is. Gandhiji said, 'she is perfectly right,' and then he said that we will arrange a meeting between you-you please come again. So I said, 'when I have my holidays, only then will I come.' Father was so nice, he said, 'alright.' So, when I had my holidays, I went, and we met on November 8.\\" Basant Kumar Birla agrees, \\"I told my colleagues, I am interested in a girl who was educated and as she was educated - even without seeing her, I had approved her.\\" Although raised in a progressive family, Sarala often at husband's side for 73 years. She was 91 years old, but it was a familiar sight to see her holding her husband's hand during family functions, and accompanying him to the annual general meetings of various group companies.

His work has centered on understanding and nurturing the process he characterizes as “common preservation,” in which individuals and group shift from futile and/or self-destructive efforts at self-preservation to strategies of collective action to promote their mutual well being. == Early Life == Jeremy Brecher was born in Washington, D.C. and in the 1950s moved to the Yelping Hill community in West Cornwall, Connecticut, where he has lived ever since. Brecher’s parents were freelance writers. His mother, Ruth Brecher, was a Quaker; his father, Edward Brecher, was a secular Jew who had been a staff member in the Federal Communications Commission and other New Deal agencies. Both were active in a range of social concerns including peace, labor, civil liberties, and community economic development. In early adolescence Brecher became active first in the nuclear disarmament movement, then in the civil rights, student, and anti-Vietnam war movements. That launched him on a continuing exploration of the history of social movements and of various ideas about how they do, or should, go about making change. Brecher attended Reed College from 1963 to 1965 and was a student and visiting fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies in Washington DC from 1965 to 1970, studying under Arthur Waskow and Marcus Raskin. In that period he also served on the staff of Rep. Robert W. Kastenmeier and of the Friends Committee on National Legislation, primarily writing material opposing the Vietnam war. He received a Ph. D. from the Union Graduate School in 1975. == Career ==  Labor History  During his time at Reed College, Brecher began to discover the then little-studied history of American labor. During the 1970s and 1980s, he wrote or co-wrote several books on working-class movements including Strike!, Common Sense for Hard Times, Root & Branch: The Rise of the Workers’ Movements, and Brass Valley: The Story of Working People’s Lives and Struggles in an American Industrial Region. This work was motivated by the hope that it might help social movements break out of their isolation from the working class and might help workers reconnect with their own traditions of solidarity and self-organization. Brecher’s first book, Strike!, told the story of “repeated, massive, and sometimes violent revolts by ordinary working people in America.” It focused on the action of rank-and- file workers “thinking, planning, drawing lessons from their own experience, organizing themselves, and taking action in common,” sometimes using “unions and other established organizations” as their means to do so but in other cases having to “organize themselves and act outside institutional channels.” It used Rosa Luxemburg’s concept of “mass strike” to analyze such peak periods of class conflict in terms of a “mass strike process” marked by three characteristics: “an expanding challenge to established authority in workplaces and beyond; a tendency for workers to take control of their own activity; and a widening solidarity and mutual support among different groups of working people.” This process often emerged in “informal workgroups” that provided the “cell unit” of mass strikes. The book argued that ordinary people can have power because “it is their activity that makes up society.” If they refuse to work, withdraw their cooperation, or take control of their own activity “they have the power to reshape society.” Such power is not “the power of some people to tell others what to do” but the power of “people directing their own activity cooperatively toward common purposes.” Strike! was described by the Washington Post as “Splendid . . . Clearly the best single-volume summary yet published of American general strikes.”[9] The New York Times called it “An exciting history of American labor” which “brings to life the flashpoints of labor history. Scholarly, Genuinely stirring;”[9] The New York Times Book Review listed it as a “Noteworthy Title.” Strike! has been repeatedly updated. The 40th anniversary edition published in 2014 included a new final chapter recounting the working class “mini-revolts” of the 21st century, including the “Battle of Seattle;” the “out of the shadows” immigrant rights marches of 2006; the “Wisconsin Uprising”; Occupy Wall Street; the Chicago public education and teachers strike of 2012; and the low-wage workers’ strikes of 2013-14. The American Library Association’s Booklist described the revised edition as “Brecher’s riveting primer on modern American labor history” which provides a “thoroughly researched, alternative history rarely mentioned in textbooks or popular media” which is “to be read alongside the books of Howard Zinn, Naomi Klein, and Noam Chomsky. In 2012 Brecher wrote a critique of Strike! which found the book marred at points by reductionism but still providing a useful perspective whose flaws were corrected in his later work. In 1969, Brecher and other collaborators including Paul Mattick, Jr., Stanley Aronowitz, and Peter Rachleff began sporadically publishing a magazine and pamphlet series called Root & Branch drawing on the tradition of workers councils and adapting them to contemporary America. In 1975 they published the collection Root & Branch: The Rise of the Workers’ Movements. Through Root & Branch Brecher met Tim Costello, a truck driver and union activist and began a forty-year collaboration. In 1973 they spent a summer travelling across the US interviewing young workers. The result was the book Common Sense for Hard Times, which combined the insights gleaned from more than 100 interviews with young workers with interpretation of the historical forces that shaped their lives. Listing the book as “recommended for wide purchase,” Library Journal called it “A popularly written analysis of modern times,” a “primer on class consciousness, written in popular style but with ample guidance for further reading.” Howard Zinn described it as “A book written in plain language about the central fact in people’s lives, the work people do, what makes it miserable and unfair, what could make it creative and good, how people are resisting the present work-system, and how change might conceivable come about.” Observing the proliferation of local coalitions among labor and other groups, in 1992 Brecher and Costello edited a collection called Building Bridges: The Emerging Grassroots Coalition of Labor and Community. The contributors described the growing role of community-labor alliances in strikes and other labor struggles; the emergence of community coalitions challenging deindustrialization and promoting alternative forms of economic development; new electoral coalitions; and labor-community issue campaigns ranging from economic conversion from military to peacetime production to the campaign to block the confirmation of Ronald Reagan’s prized conservative judge Robert Bork to the Supreme Court. The book also included programmatic alternatives ranging from employee ownership to statewide economic development strategies to military conversion. The Nation called Building Bridges “massively inspiring,” a “splendid collection of essays” and “one of the best practical how-to organizing manuals around.”  History from Below  Brecher’s work on labor history left him with a desire to “find or invent some way to do it that included those who had lived the experiences I was studying.” In collaboration with community organizer Jan Stackhouse and video documentarian Jerry Lombardi, in 1979 Brecher initiated the Brass Workers History Project in western Connecticut’s Naugatuck Valley. Funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Connecticut Humanities Council, the project involved participation of more than 200 workers and community members who provided documents, participated in interviews, served on an advisory committee, and reviewed the project’s products. In 1982, Brecher and his collaborators published Brass Valley: The Story Of Working People’s Lives And Struggles In An American Industrial Region. It utilized interviews, photos, and memorabilia to provide a voice and cohesion for the brass worker community and a scholarship-based interpretation of its history. Ron Grele, director of the Oral History Research Office at Columbia University, described its “genius”: “I can think of no work, except perhaps Passing the Time in Ballymenone, that brings to bear so carefully and intimately the concerns and interpretations of the historian on the locality as it is perceived by its people; that is so sympathetic to that history and so grounded in the people's vision itself.\\" It is “by far the most ambitious, and in many senses, the most successful such effort.\\" George Rawick of the University of Missouri called it \\"Absolutely wonderful -- the best single book on working class history in the U.S. we now have.\\" Gary Gerstle in Technology and Culture described Brass Valley as “The most comprehensive social history of a city or region in 20th century American yet to appear” and “a great achievement in using oral history to explore work and community life in 20th- century America.” Brass Valley was selected for inclusion in the “UAW’s Labor Bookshelf.” In 1984 the Brass Workers History Project produced the 90-minute Connecticut Public Television documentary Brass Valley for which Brecher served as writer and historian. In 1986, Brecher published History From Below: How To Uncover And Tell The Story Of Your Community, Association, Or Union, a guide to doing participatory history based on the experience of the Brass Workers History Project and other work. Studs Terkel described History from Below as “an exciting primer, enabling ‘ordinary’ people, non-academics, to recover their own personal and community’s pasts.” He added, “Jeremy Brecher’s work is astonishing and refreshing; and, God knows, necessary. In this work lies the way to help cure our national amnesia.”[23] Brecher has continued to create community-based historical and cultural products in the Naugatuck Valley. From 1988 to 1996 the Waterbury Ethnic Music Project collected and recorded hundreds of songs and tunes in more than 20 ethnic groups and produced 13 public radio programs in the Brass City Music series and the public television documentary Brass City Music as well as six Brass Valley Music Festivals.[24][25] He served as project historian for the exhibit Brass Roots at Waterbury’s Mattatuck Museum, which received 900,000 visitors between 1986 and 2005. He also served as project historian for the Mattatuck Museum’s new permanent exhibit, Coming Home, Building Community in a Changing World, which won the 2010 Wilbur Cross Award of the Connecticut Humanities Council for “Exemplary Public Programming.”[26] Between 1990 and 2006 he served as project historian for a series of oral history projects and community exhibits on neighborhoods and the African American, Jewish, and Puerto Rican communities in Waterbury. Brecher also served as historian for the Naugatuck Valley Project (NVP), a community coalition formed in 1986 to confront plant closings and deindustrialization that has continued for twenty-five years as a significant vehicle for community action in the Naugatuck Valley. He recorded approximately one hundred audiotape interviews with NVP leaders, staff, and participants. His Connecticut Public Television documentary Rust Valley told the story of the Naugatuck Valley’s deindustrialization and the early efforts of the Naugatuck Valley Project to address them. His 2010 book Banded Together: Economic Democratization in the Brass Valley presents the development of the Naugatuck Valley in the decades following the publication of Brass Valley and describes community-based efforts to respond to its deindustrialization.[27] Professor Robert Forrant of the University of Massachusetts Lowell wrote in the ILR Review, “Brecher employs his knowledge of labor history and a great capacity for listening to his interviewees to tell the story of the Naugatuck Valley Project’s (NVP) success in keeping open nearly a dozen industrial plants and eventually starting new employee-owned businesses.”[28] In 1984, Brecher and associates formed Stone Soup, Inc. a non-profit educational and cultural organization based in Connecticut. Over the succeeding decades it produced dozens of videos, TV and radio programs, books, curricula, community programs, cultural festivals, and other educational products. Cornwall in Pictures: A Visual Reminiscence, 1868-1941, published in 2001 in collaboration with a local community working group in Brecher’s home town of Cornwall, CT was favorably reviewed by the New York Times on its publication in 2001; and later received a 2003 Certificate of Commendation from the American Association for State and Local History.[29] Brecher’s “history from below” work has pioneered what historical theorist Michael Frisch has called “shared authority” between history professionals and the communities they study and address. According to historian James R. Green, the “exciting use of oral history” as a “record of how people told their stories and made their own historical interpretations” was “epitomized in the work of Jeremy Brecher and his colleagues.”[30]  Connecticut Public History  From 1989 to 2001 Brecher served as Humanities Scholar-in-Residence at Connecticut Public Television and Radio, a position supported by the Connecticut Humanities Council.[31][32] He wrote the scripts for the documentaries The Roots of Roe, Schools in Black and White, Rust Valley, The Amistad Revolt, Electronic Road Film, Brass City Music, and Dance on the Wind, the last two of which he co-produced. Brecher developed and supervised the CPTV series The Connecticut Experience which included more than twenty documentaries on Connecticut topics. In 1995 the Federation of State Humanities Councils Schwartz Prize citation called The Connecticut Experience “A superb example of Council-conducted initiative, joining the best talents of the council with those of the television profession to produce programs of prize-winning quality and broad appeal. In addition to the triumph in media- program administration, by using the humanities to illuminate specific, complex issues currently confronting the state, it produced the most comprehensive and effective contribution, by any council project we know of, to the self-definition of the state.” A list of many of the documentaries Brecher wrote and/or co-produced can be found listed under the \\"filmography\\" section. Brecher was producer, writer, and host of Connecticut Public Radio’s Remembering Connecticut, which broadcast more than 80 radio programs on a wide variety of Connecticut topics. The Oral History Review called Remembering Connecticut “One of the most ambitious, and certainly the longest-running, radio history series in the United States. . . Historically grounded to a degree rare in programming of this sort. . . Accessible, engaging, and far ranging.” A list of over fifty episodes can be found below under the section \\"Radio Credits\\". In 2000 Brecher received the Connecticut Humanities Council Wilber Cross Award for Humanities Scholar of the Year.  Globalization  While working on the Brass Workers History Project, Brecher became aware that the deindustrialization he was seeing in the Naugatuck Valley was largely the result of what would soon be known as economic globalization.[33] Brecher became increasingly concerned with economic globalization and the movements that developed to counter it over the course of the 1980s. He collaborated on three books on the subject: Global Visions, Global Village or Global Pillage, and Globalization from Below. Global Visions: Beyond the New World Order, a 1993 “multifesto” edited by Brecher, John Brown Childs, and Jill Cutler, aimed to “initiate a dialogue which will establish globalization-from-below as a new paradigm for understanding and reshaping the world order.”[34] Bruce Shapiro, contributing editor, The Nation, described it as “ the first book to make radical sense of the politics of the 1990s. Its astoundingly diverse contributors, drawn from the full spectrum of social-change and democracy movements, cut through both defeatism and ideological nostalgia with an invigorating and accessible vision of globalization-from-below.\\"[35] Global Village or Global Pillage, written with Tim Costello, focused on economic globalization itself. David Montgomery, President of the American Historical Association, wrote in The Nation of Global Village or Global Pillage: “Penetrating analysis . . . crisp and simple language . . . as penetrating as it is succinct . . . an effective antidote to the mood of resignation before the omnipotence of transnational business institutions which pervades the political discourse of our times . . . timely and important.”[36] Brecher also wrote and produced the documentary Global Village or Global Pillage? which received the Gold Special Jury Award at the Houston International Film Festival, the Best Documentary award at the FirstGlance 5 Philadelphia Film and Video Festival, and a 2001 Emmy Award Nomination from the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences Target Audience Program. It was shown at the AFL-CIO Executive Council meeting and at the largest rally at the protests that shut down the World Trade Organization Millennial Summit in Seattle in 1999. The United Steel Workers union distributed a copy to every Steelworkers local in the U.S. In 1998, Rep. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) read Global Village or Global Pillage and asked Brecher to work for him part-time on globalization issues. Together with Sanders staff member Brendan Smith, Brecher developed the Global Sustainable Development Resolution which provided a comprehensive program for transforming the global economy based on the programs of a wide range of public interest organizations and policy analysts. Brecher resigned from Rep. Sanders staff on April 29, 1999 when Sanders voted to support a resolution authorizing air strikes against Serbia,[37] but Smith continued to organize around the bill. Sherrod Brown, Cynthia McKinney, and Dennis Kusinich served as original cosponsors. Tom Barry of the Interhemespheric Resource Center called it “A fantastic effort to pull together a cohesive approach to global economy reform.” Trim Bissell of the Campaign for Labor Rights called it “A Magna Carta for the new millennium.” Globalization from Below, written with Tim Costello and Brendan Smith in the aftermath of the Seattle WTO protests, recounted the emergence of transnational social movements embodying what they called “globalization from below.” Frances Fox Piven called Globalization from Below “lean, thoughtful, and incisive . . . A must- read.”[38] In 2005, Tim Costello asked Brecher and Brendan Smith to collaborate in creating an organization called Global Labor Strategies (GLS) “to contribute to building global labor solidarity through research, analysis, strategic thinking, and network building around labor and employment issues.”[39] In 2006 GLS discovered a debate unfolding in China about a Labor Contract Law whose key provisions were being opposed by the American and European Chambers of Commerce. Global Labor Strategies organized an international protest against this corporate opposition in the aftermath of which international union federations pressured their employers to reverse course; human rights organizations mobilized support for Chinese workers' rights; US members of Congress introduced legislation decrying the corporate intervention and apparent administration complicity; and China's official labor organization, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU), took a strong stand against corporate pressure.[40] This innovative work was prematurely ended by Costello’s death in 2009.  Climate Protection  Brecher first became aware of the threat of global warming in the early 1970s from the writings of social ecologist Murray Bookchin.[41] In Common Sense for Hard Times, Brecher and Costello, citing Barry Commoner, warned that environmental degradation could destroy the capability of the environment to support a reasonably civilized human society.[42] In 1988 Brecher wrote a widely reprinted op ed for the Chicago Tribune called “The Opening Shot of the Second Ecological Revolution.” In maintained that a movement responding to global warming and other results of global environmental connectedness will have to “impose its agenda on governments and businesses.” It will have to say that “preserving the conditions for human life is simply more important than increasing national power or private wealth.” And “it will have to act globally -- with international petition drives, worldwide demonstrations and boycotts, and direct action campaigns against polluting countries and corporations.”[43] In Global Village or Global Pillage, Brecher and Costello warned that “Global warming, desertification, pollution, and resource exhaustion will make the earth uninhabitable long before every Chinese has a private car and every American a private boat or plane.”[44] They maintained that the solution lies in “converting the system of production and consumption to an ecologically sound basis. The technology to do this exists or can be developed, from solar energy to public transportation and from reusable products to resource-minimizing production processes.”[45] The role of organized labor in climate issues was a central focus of Global Labor Strategies, which in 2007 issued Brecher’s discussion paper “Labor and Global Warming.”[46] In 2009, Brecher, Costello, and Brendan Smith joined retired AFL-CIO leader Joe Uehlein to form the Labor Network for Sustainability (LNS),[47] which aimed to help build the “strong, broad movement that is needed to advance strategies for a transition from a world with an economy, society, and climate in crisis to one that has a sustainable future.”[48] LNS, soon joined by Becky Glass, published scores of reports, articles, and commentaries by Brecher, including “If Not Now, When? A Labor Movement Plan to Address Climate Change” (with Ron Blackwell and Joe Uehlein)[49] and Jobs Beyond Coal: A Manual for Communities, Workers, and Environmentalists.[50] David Bonior, Chair of American Rights at Work and former Congressman (D-MI) said, “The Labor Network for Sustainability is helping build a vision for the labor movement that sees beyond the bargaining table. They understand that the lives and livelihoods of workers depend on addressing the climate crisis, and that now is our best -- and possibly last -- chance to build a more just and sustainable society.”[48] Brecher’s 2015 book Climate Insurgency: A Strategy for Survival presented a brief history of the failure of climate protection efforts “from above” and “from below,” and proposed a “global nonviolent constitutional insurgency” as a “plausible strategy” for climate protection.[51] Richard Falk, Professor Emeritus of International Law and Practice, Princeton University, described it as “An exceptionally valuable contribution to thought, feeling, and action on this greatest challenge that has ever confronted humanity as a whole. All in all, the most stimulating response to climate change that I have encountered. I think it is one of those books that could make a difference!”[52]  Common Preservation  Starting in the early 1970s, Brecher began “autodidactic raiding parties” into general systems theory, cybernetics, and genetic structuralism, “what is now often called nonlinear or complexity theory,” seeking “to understand complex interactive processes and systems.”[53] This project was influenced by such thinkers as Norbert Weiner, Ludvig von Bertalanffy, and especially Jean Piaget.[54] Over the course of forty years Brecher integrated the results with his own historical research and experience into a manuscript called Common Preservation.[55] The heuristic that emerged guided Brecher’s earlier work at least tacitly and his later work more explicitly.[53] The first volume derived from this longer study was published in 2012 as Save the Humans? Common Preservation in Action.[56] Save the Humans? argued that “Today, self- preservation depends on common preservation – cooperation in service of our mutual well-being. For any of us to survive, we must preserve the conditions of each other’s existence.”[57] Brecher described the book as “The story of a lifelong search for the means of common preservation.”[58] Save the Humans analyzed many historical cases in which new forms of common preservation had emerged, and found them to often be related to what it called an “ecological shift” like the shift in worldview “from isolated to interdependent organisms” introduced by the science of ecology. In this shift, “people come to recognize apparently separate, independent entities as part of larger wholes.”[54] This often involves “the self-organization of people who have been isolated or even antagonistic.” It often “overcomes powerlessness” by making use of various forms of “people power” based on “a refusal to obey those currently in charge.”[59] Save the Humans explored the possibility of a “human preservation movement” specifically targeted against “the threats to human survival.”[59] Michael Pertschuk, former chair, Federal Communications Commission, wrote that “In forty years, I have never learned more useful knowledge about advocacy than from this book. It is absolutely unique in its integration of engaging personal narratives of the author’s direct involvement in every significant social justice movement of the past four decades with his analytic history of previous movements.”[60] Brecher is currently completing a companion volume intended to provide a heuristic for how to understand and nourish common preservation.[61] == Activism == Over the course of half a century, Brecher has participated in movements for nuclear disarmament, civil rights, peace in Vietnam, international labor rights, global economic justice, accountability for war crimes, and many others.[62] In the early 1960s Brecher barnstormed with an American Friends Service Committee “peace caravan”[63]; organized a high school forum called Challenge; provided local support for the “Freedom Riders;”[64] and was active in SANE[65] and the Student Peace Union.[66] He was Northwest regional organizer and a national council member of Students for a Democratic Society.[67] In the later 1960s Brecher helped staff the National Conference for New Politics and Vietnam Summer, participated in the Committee to End the War in Vietnam (later National Mobilization Committee, New Mobe), and helped support the emerging Women’s Liberation Movement.[68] Starting in the 1970s, Brecher helped publish Root & Branch and Commonwork Pamphlets, which published his writings opposing reinstitution of the military draft.[14][69] In the 1980s and 1990s he was active in the Campaign on Contingent Work[70], the North American Federation for Fair Employment[71], and the Naugatuck Valley Project. He was arrested for occupying the office of Rep. Nancy Johnson in a protest against the mining of Nicaragua harbors.[72] In the 2000s he helped organize the Iraq Pledge of Resistance, the Iraq Moratorium, War Crimes Watch, and Global Labor Strategies and with Jill Cutler and Brendan Smith edited the collection In the Name of Democracy: American War Crimes in Iraq and Beyond[72] which Booklist described as an “excellent anthology” that includes “interviews, FBI documents, legal briefs, and statements by soldiers turned resisters, all offering a chilling look at how the war was begun and is currently operating.”[72] In the 2010s he helped form Labor Network for Sustainability and the Connecticut Roundtable on Climate and Jobs.[73][74] He helped support and wrote extensively about Occupy Wall Street.[75][76][77] Brecher was arrested in the first KXL pipeline protests at the White House in 2011.[78] == Filmography == * Brass City Music (1988) * Electronic Road Film (1988) * Schools in Black and White (1991) * Between Boston and New York (1992) * As We Tell Our Stories: Native Americans in Connecticut (1994) * The Roots of Roe (1994) * The Amistad Revolt (1995) * Puerto Rican Passages (1995) * Rust Valley (1995) * Colt: Legend and Legacy (1997) * African Americans in Connecticut: The Colonial Era To The Civil War (1998) *African Americans in Connecticut: Civil War to Civil Rights (1998) * From Here to There (1998) * Connecticut and the Sea (2000) * Schools Good Enough for All (2000) * Connecticut's Tobacco Valley (2001) * Home Front: Connecticut During WWII (2001) * The Green (2001) * Connecticut and Its Cities: Challenge of Renewal, part I (2002) * Connecticut and Its Cities: Challenge of Renewal, part II (2002) * Connecticut and Its Cities: Three Centuries of Change, Part I (2002) * East of the River (2004) * The Rise and Fall of Newgate Prison (2004) * Dance On The Wind (2006) == Radio Program Credits == * The Glacier and Its Effects * Ancient Indigenous Settlements * The Pequot War * Connecticut’s Ecology Transformed * Seventeenth Century Witchcraft * A People on the Move: The Great Migration Out of Connecticut 1760-1850 * The Yankee Character * The Yankee Peddlers * James Mars: A Slave in Connecticut * Prudence Crandall * The Amistad Affair * The Civil War * Catharine Beecher and Nineteenth Century Domesticity * Mark Twain in Hartford * The Anti-Irish Crusade * Where Did the Fish Go? * The Knights of Labor * The French-Canadians In Connecticut * Home Work * Immigrant Mutual Aid * Chain Migration and Connecticut’s Ethnic Communities * Salmon Rock * Connecticut Women in Industry During World War II * Connecticut’s Lost Industrial Crafts * Connecticut’s War at Home * The Fight for Women’s Suffrage * J.

Later the superfast status was erased, made to terminate at Madras Central (now Chennai Central instead of Madras Beach (now Chennai Beach) as an Express and connection with Madras - Rameswaram Exp removed and name changed from Ganga Kaveri Exp to Madras - Varanasi Express. Thus increased halts at some stations, converted from one-night to two-nights train, slowed down by more than 3 hours, Green and Yellow colored Rakes withdrawn and AC sleeper service introduced., [IRFCA.com],11 April 2015.

Currently, this train is under criticism since the name of the train currently running wasn't suitable (because this train originates in Chennai not in Trichy where Kaveri river is running and in Chennai only Coovum river is there and hence reason).Also passengers are requesting to change these old, rusting coaches(this train was running still with old ICF rakes for 40+ years) to new LHB rakes since this train is highly preferred for local tourist organisations and senior citizens following Hinduism for doing last rites such as Funeral ceremony and ceremonies to the deceased ancestors and also it is the only straight train from Chennai to Varanasi. ==Route== The following are the major junctions en route: Gudur, Ongole, Vijayawada, Khammam, Warangal, Ramagundam, Balharshah, Nagpur, Itarsi, Jabalpur, Katni, Satna, Allahabad, Varanasi and Ghazipur city. ==Traction== It is hauled by a Royapuram based WAP 7 or Erode based WAP 4 locomotive from Chennai Central to Itarsi Jn..

The electoral system was introduced for the first time in 1847, and 4 of the 7 board members were elected by the rate payers. In 1852 the board was replaced by a new one and in 1863 a new body was formed. As per old records, in 1872 there were 25 wards in Kolkata (spellings as in use at that time) – 1. Shyampukur, 2. Kumartuli, 3. Bartala, 4. Sukea Street, 5. Jorabagan, 6. Jorasanko, 7. Barabazar, 8. Kolutola, 9. Muchipara, 10. Boubazar, 11. Padmapukur, 12. Waterloo Street, 13. Fenwick Bazar, 14. Taltala, 15.

A new municipal corporation was created in 1876, wherein 48 commissioners were elected and 24 were appointed by the government. With the implementation of the Municipal Consolidation Act of 1888 the area under the jurisdiction of the municipal corporation was enlarged. Certain areas were already there but more parts of them were added (current spellings) - Entally, Manicktala, Beliaghata, Ultadanga, Chitpur, Cossipore, Beniapukur, Ballygunge, Watganj and Ekbalpur, and Garden Reach and Tollygunj. The Calcutta Municipal Act of 1923 brought about important changes. It liberalised the constitution along democratic lines.Bagchi, Amiya Kumar, Wealth and Work in Calcutta, 1860-1921, in Calcutta, the Living City, Vol. I, edited by Sukanta Chaudhuri, p. 213-215, Oxford University Press, . The state government superseded the Corporation in 1948 and the Calcutta Municipal Act of 1951 came into force. Adult franchise was introduced in municipal elections in 1962. With the addition of certain areas in the southern parts of the city, the number of wards increased from 75 to 144. ==Geography== Ward No. 37 is bordered on the north by Keshab Sen Street; on the east by Acharya Prafulla Chandra Street; on the south by Surya Sen Street; and on the west by Raja Rammohan Roy Sarani.Kolkata: Detail Maps of 141 Wards with Street Directory.

It belongs to the chlorophyll-a/b-binding family of proteins, and has been shown to have a photoprotection role in preventing oxidative damage via energy dissipation. It was originally identified under Fe starvation, and thus received the name iron-starvation-induced protein A. However, the protein has more recently been found to respond to a variety of stress conditions such as high irradiance. It can aggregate with carotenoids and form rings around the PSI reaction center complexes to aid in photoprotective energy dissipation. ==Antenna function== IsiA functions as an antenna for photosystem I (PSI) under iron-limiting conditions, when phycobilisomes disappear. In the (PSI)3(Isi3)18 complex most of the harvested energy is probably used by PSI; in other PSI-containing supercomplexes a large part of the energy will probably not be used for light harvesting, but rather is dissipated to protect the organism from light damage. Under iron-starvation, it forms a complex with PSI trimers, where the trimer is surrounded by a ring composed of 18 isiA subunits. When the PSI subunits PsaF and PsaJ are missing the ring is composed of 17 isiA subunits, indicating that each isiA subunit has a different interaction with the trimer. This suggests that the size of the PSI complex determines the number of isiA units in the surrounding ring. In the absence of PsaL, it has a tendency to form incomplete rings with PSI monomers, suggesting PsaL helps form the rings. Also it can form other aggregates of varying sizes depending on the level of iron deprivation. ==Photoprotective function== IsiA aggregates forming empty multimeric rings (without PSI) also accumulate and are very abundant in long- term iron-depleted cells. When isolated, these aggregates are in a strongly quenched state, suggesting they are responsible for thermal dissipation of absorbed energy. IsiA is also synthesized in cells grown under high light irradiances, protecting from photodamage == See also == * Photosystem II light-harvesting protein == References  External links == * __notoc__ Category:Bacterial proteins ","title":"Iron-starvation-induced protein A"},{"id":"46376463","text":"Egyházasgerge is a village in Nógrád County, Hungary with 850 inhabitants (2001).

The first trams in Buenos Aires began operating in 1863 in what quickly became a vast network of tramways with the city being known as the \\"City of Trams\\" for having the highest tramway-to- population ratio in the world.Trams Of Argentina - Don Ross Group, 7 November 2014.Historia del tranvía en Buenos Aires - Revista Digital eadUn viaje por la historia de la ciudad en el viejo Tramway - ElDiario.es, 21 March 2015. In the 1920s, Buenos Aires had of tramways and 99 tram lines using 3000 carriages running throughout the city. By 1963, the vast majority of the network began to be dismantled, though some minor tram services continue in the city today. ==History== Horse-drawn and steam-powered trams Horse-drawn trams in front of the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Cathedral. The first horse-drawn trams began circulating the city in 1863 as a feeder service to the railways, taking passengers from Plaza de Mayo to the Retiro Terminal,La historia del tranvía de Buenos Aires, un recorrido por la nostalgia - Eterna Buenos Aires, 18 January 2011. where it connected to the Buenos Aires Northern Railway. A second similar horse-drawn feeder service was established between Monserrat and the Constitución railway terminal in 1866 to service the Buenos Aires Great Southern Railway. The first urban tramways were inaugurated in 1870 by Argentine pioneer Federico Lacroze and his brother Julio. These two lines were the Lacroze brothers' Central Tramway (Tramway Central) and the Méndez brothers' Tramway 11 de Septiembre, which both ran parallel from Plaza de Mayo westwards to Plaza Miserere, currently the home of Once de Septiembre railway station.APUNTES SOBRE LA HISTORIA DEL TRANVÍA EN BUENOS AIRES - Biblioteca Popular Federico Lacroze The tramways were first met with scepticism from the public, however by 1880 numerous other tram operators began to appear - such as the Anglo-Argentine Tramways Company - and the city would eventually emerge as having the largest tramway-to-population ratio in the world, gaining a global reputation for many decades as the \\"City of Trams\\". During this period, up until electrification, there was also an abundance of steam-powered trams which also gradually replaced the horse-drawn ones.LOS TRANSPORTES EN LOMAS DE ZAMORA: Los tranvias - Centro de Investigaciones Territoriales y Ambientales Bonaerenses (CITAB) Electrification of the network Electric trams circulating in Buenos Aires. In 1880 Fyodor Pirotsky created the first electric tram in Saint PetersbergKorney Kolomnov, , Zerkalo Nedeli, 379 . (web.archive.org copy from 2003-06-30.) and Argentina opened its first electric tram in 1892 in the city of La Plata, south of Buenos Aires. Buenos Aires would not receive its first electric trams until 1897 when the North American engineer Charles Bright and the Argentine engineer Juan Mallol opened their \\"Buenos Ayres Electric Tramway\\" and \\"Tramways La Capital\\" lines in the city.Tranvías de Buenos Aires: historia sobre rieles - Terra, 24 November 2013 These vehicles operated at 30 km/h, which was considered to be extremely fast for the time and led a journalist writing about an initial voyage to refer to the electric tram as \\"a furious vehicle that eats up the ground with its frightening speed\\".Tranvías en Buenos Aires - Buenos Aires Antiguo By 1914, the last of the horse-drawn trams were retired and the - now much larger - network was completely electrified. The Belgian Compagnie Générale de Tramways de Buenos-Ayres took over the Anglo-Argentine Tramways Company in 1908 and standardised much of the network, though many Argentine companies such as the Lacroze Company remained. In the early 1900s the network expanded rapidly as a result of electrification and by the mid-1920s the system has reached its maximum extension of 875 km with 3,000 vehicles carrying 650 million passengers a year on 99 lines serviced by 12,000 employees. At the same time, some of the tramways began moving underground when the Anglo-Argentine Tramways Company opened the Buenos Aires Underground's Line A in 1913, becoming the first underground rail in Latin America, the southern hemisphere and the Spanish speaking world.BUENOS AIRES - Urban RailEl Subte: 100 años bajo tierra - Noticias Urbanas, 28 November 2013 20th Century Buses competing with trams (1936). In 1922 the first Colectivos (buses) began to appear in the city and by 1928 were competing fiercely with the trams, with many operators going as far as running their colectivos in front of the trams to try and steal their passengers. However, the trams did remain competitive, even going as far as offering a special \\"workers fare\\" in which people using trams from 5 until 7 in the morning could get a reduced fare at half the standard rate, something which was later abolished in 1949. The network saw somewhat of a resurgence following the nationalisation of the country's railways in 1948, which also saw the creation of Transportes de Buenos Aires (TBA) which incorporated the city's trams and buses, while Subterráneos de Buenos Aires (SBA) managed the underground. Under this new administration, the network saw almost all the rails and overhead lines, as well as the rolling stock, almost completely replaced in the years from 1955 to 1961. At the same time, this period saw a significant increase in traffic, so much so that double-decker trams were re-incorporated into the network. However, this resurgence and rapid growth of the network was to be short-lived, since in 1961 - under pressure from private interests threatened by what they perceived to be a state monopoly on public transport - the Argentine Congress passed a law which would see the dismantling of the network, citing \\"obsolescence as a means of transport\\" and TBA's budgetary deficit as motives. From 1961 to 1963 the system was gradually dismantled, despite what many saw as a golden age for the tramways. The final trams ceased operating in February 1963, just a few days after the 100-year anniversary of the first tram in Buenos Aires. Most of the tram services saw direct replacements with the hundreds of buses purchased by the Government of Argentina from Leyland Motors.Leyland Urbanos en los '60. - BusARG File:Tranvía fúnebre - exterior (Lacroze - Tramway Rural).pngA Lacroze Company funeral tram File:Tranvía a caballos tipo jardinera (Lacroze - Tramway Rural).pngA Lacroze Company horse-drawn tram File:1897 Buenos Aires interior de un tranvía (tranway) eléctrico.jpgPassengers aboard early electric tram (1897) File:San Martín y Viamonte.jpgElectric tram (c.1940) Catita Imperial en marcha.jpgDouble decker CATITA Imperial File:Tranvia completo con los festejos del 17 de octubre (Buenos Aires).jpgWorkers celebrating the \\"birth of Peronism\\" ==PreMetro== Original Materfer tram (foreground) with refurbished tram in the background.

It is currently operated by the private company Metrovías, who also operate the Underground and the Urquiza Line in the city.Nuestra compañía - Metrovias It uses Argentine-built Materfer trams, though for a brief period it used re-bodied La Brugeoise cars from the Underground while the Materfer trams were being constructed.Van Hattum, C. (August 1989). \\"Developments in Buenos Aires\\". Modern Tramway, pp. 271–273. UK: Ian Allan Ltd. Originally there were supposed to be two PreMetro lines, however the second line (E1) was never built following the privatisation of the country's railways in the early 1990s. More recent plans to build the line (which, along with E2, would service some of the poorer parts of the city) were further thwarted after the construction of a MetroBus line to the south of the city.Premetro a Puente de la Noria, en el olvido por el Metrobus del Sur - EnElSubte, 16 August 2014 However, plans are underway to refurbish the existing E2 line, including the construction of a new terminal and the restoration of the line's stops.Realizan contratación directa para renovar la terminal del Premetro - EnElSubte, 13 March 2015. ==Heritage Tramway== A parade of trams to celebrate 150 years of trams in Buenos Aires. Today, the Association of Friends of the Tramway (Spanish: Asociación Amigos del Tranvía) maintain and refurbish numerous trams inside the Polvorín workshop in the neighbourhood of Caballito, which also serves as the workshop for Line A of the Buenos Aires Underground. The group formed in 1980 and runs a heritage tramway in the neighborhood, which often features jazz bands playing on the trams.La AAT celebra con un festival los 150 años del tranvía - EnElSubte, 12 July 2013 The service is free and is open on Saturdays and Sundays and public holidays all year round from 4pm to 7.30pm.Tranvía Histórico - Buenos Aires 123 The tramway has many trams dating back as far as the early 1900s which are used on its 2 km circuit. As part of the AAT's ongoing restoration and acquisition of more trams to add to its museum, it also acquired some La Brugeoise cars, which up until 2013 served Line A of the Underground, with the intention of restoring them and converting them to be used as trams, which was their original use before the Underground.Realizan pruebas con Brugeoise reconvertidos a 1500 V en la línea A - EnElSubte, 11 July 2014.

The Puerto Madero Tramway was a tram which ran in Puerto Madero from 2007 to 2012 on a 2 km-long stretch with 4 stations. The tramway closed after experiencing low passenger numbers, largely due to the linear nature of the line which only operated in a sparsely populated part of the area.\\"El tranvía de Puerto Madero está a la deriva\\", Infobae, 9 Jan 2013Tramways & Urban Transit, January 2013, p. 29. UK: LRTA Publishing. Extensions had been planned to the Retiro railway station and to La Boca, which would have added an extra 7 km to the line, however the plans were ultimately abandoned. In Greater Buenos Aires the Tren de la Costa, which uses articulated CAF trams, was opened in 1995. It links to the General Mitre Railway in northern Buenos Aires and runs from Olivos to Tigre.Tren de la Costa from Buenos Aires to Tigre - The Real Argentina. ==See also== *Anglo- Argentine Tramways Company *La Brugeoise cars *Line A (Buenos Aires Underground) *List of town tramway systems in Argentina *Polvorín Workshop *Rail transport in Argentina *Trams in Rosario ==References * Category:Light rail in Argentina Category:Tram transport in Argentina Category:Public transport in Argentina Category:Transport in Buenos Aires Category:Articles containing video clips Buenos Aires ","title":"Trams in Buenos Aires"},{"id":"46376521","text":"Panic in the City is a 1968 American neo noir thriller film directed by Eddie Davis and written by Eddie Davis and Charles E.

The couple met in Kharkiv in 1923 and they were formally and informally married in September that year. The next few years she lived in Norway and France, often separated from Vidkun due to his work and travels. They settled permanently in Norway in 1929 where Vidkun was one of the founders of the fascist party Nasjonal Samling. During the German occupation of Norway, Vidkun led a pro-National Socialist puppet regime. Maria lived with him in the Villa Grande from 1941 to 1945 and served as hostess for social gatherings there and at the Royal Palace. After Vidkun was found guilty of treason and sentenced to death, she made several appeals to authorities on his behalf, though unsuccessfully. She was briefly arrested in 1946 for her actions during the occupation, but all charges were dropped. She fought for many years to get back the apartment and other properties she and Vidkun had owned. A final settlement was reached in 1955, giving her the apartment, many paintings and furniture and a sum of money. In 1959, she also got an urn with her husband's ashes, which she buried at Gjerpen church yard in a small ceremony. After having lived a secluded life in Oslo after the war, she died in 1980, leaving her assets to a charity fund bearing her and Vidkun's name which each year gives a small sum of money to a limited number of elderly persons. == Early life and marriage == Quisling lived in central Kharkiv and fondly remembered a stroll at the river when Vidkun walked her home from a party a summer night in 1923. Postcard c. 1900 Maria Quisling's birth was probably in November 1900 in Kharkiv in the then Russian Empire in Ukraine. A student's card says she was born in 1899. Information about her family is uncertain. She told her family-in-law that her father had been a higher civil servant.Dahl (1991), p.105 She finished high school in 1918 and obtained a degree from Kharkov Economic Institute in 1922. The same year she started working for a Ukrainian organization which co-ordinated the work of various foreign aid organizations in the area, including the Nansen aid. She met Vidkun for the first time in March 1923 and a romantic relationship developed during the summer that year, even though Vidkun had formally married Alexandra Voronin in August 1922. Historian Hans Fredrik Dahl believes Maria knew about the relationship with Alexandra and accepted his explanation that it was a pro-forma marriage to help Alexandra out of Russia.Dahl (1991), p. 94 According to Quisling, she and Vidkun were married at the Norwegian legation in Moscow on 10 September 1923.Dahl (1991), p.95 Historians believe this is wrong, as Norway did not formally recognize the new Soviet authorities before 1924, and the representative at the Norwegian Commerce office did not have the right to perform marriages and was not in Moscow on 10 September. If the couple had a civil marriage in Kharkov, there has never been any documentation for it. Historian Hans Fredrik Dahl believes some kind of marriage took place in Kharkov on that day, but he is unsure whether it happened in formally correct ways or was an informal ceremony.Dahl (1991), pp.94–95 The same day as the marriage allegedly took place, Maria got a special passport for employees of Nansen Action. It was issued to \\"Mary Quisling\\".Dahl (1991), p. 96 Quisling left Russia on her own and arrived in Paris, where in late 1923 she was reunited with Vidkun and Alexandra, who had travelled together. They lived for a time at Hotel Studia in the Latin Quarter,Dahl (1991), p.99Dahl (1991), p.104 though they travelled to Vienna and other places from November to January 1924. In June 1924, Maria, Alexandra and Vidkun travelled to Norway and Maria was introduced to his family as his new wife and spent some time with Vidkun's parents in Telemark where she started to learn Norwegian. Alexandra, who Vidkun the year before had introduced as his wife, was now referred to as a child he took care of. Alexandra left Norway permanently later that summer. Quisling returned to France in 1926 where she met Alexandra again and had the company of other Russian immigrants.Dahl (1991), p.112 She lived in Normandy and in Paris where she attended courses at La Sorbonne for a while.Dahl (1991), p.131 After Vidkun got a position in Moscow as legation secretary in charge of British Diplomatic affairs which was handled by Norway, she joined him there in November 1928. The couple lived for a time together with linguist Olaf Broch and his wife and later with diplomat Per Prebensen and his wife Ragnhild.Dahl (1991), pp.132–133 During 1928 and 1929, the Quislings bought numerous paintings and antiques, as well as silverware and furniture.Juritzen (2008), pp.154–155 Vidkun used his savings and an inheritance from his mother to pay for the purchases. According to Maria's later statements, her mother arrived in Moscow with a sum of money that was Quisling's inheritance from her father, though author Arve Juritzen has questioned whether the mother actually was in Moscow that year. She was at the time poor and relied on economic support from Vidkun.Juritzen (2008), pp.285–289Dahl (1991), pp.38–39 In December 1929, the couple settled in Oslo, where in 1922 Vidkun had bought an apartment in Erling Skjalgssons gate 26 in Frogner.Dahl (1991), p.139 Most of the 200 paintings were placed in safe deposit boxes, as they proved difficult to sell for the prices Vidkun had expected. He had believed many of the paintings were by renowned painters, but they were mostly found to be copies. == Involvement in Nasjonal Samling and the Quisling regime == Villa Grande (Gimle) in 1945 Stolypin When Nasjonal Samling (NS) was founded in 1933, Maria Quisling was registered as a member by Vidkun. She was lightly involved in the beginning but never had any political role.Juritzen (2008), pp. 181 and 188 When Germany invaded Norway in 1940, Vidkun became leader of a pro-Nazi puppet regime. In December 1941, Maria and Vidkun moved into Villa Grande, which Vidkun renamed Gimle for its significance in Norse mythology as a utopian place. Construction of the building had begun in 1917, but was left uncompleted until the collaborationist authorities designated it a residence for the Quisling couple in the beginning of 1941. Maria Quisling actively took part in the furnishing of the residence, which included Russian furniture and a large painting the couple had bought in Moscow.Juritzen (2008), pp.202 and 205 She also hired servants, 12 at the most, and regularly shopped at Steen & Strøm, Glasmagasinet and other places. During this time there was no clear line drawn between the couple's expenses and that of the state.Juritzen (2008), pp.214–216 When Vidkun was appointed Minister President on 1 February 1942, a large celebration took place at Villa Grande, with Maria Quisling as hostess.Juritzen (2008), pp.209–210 She hosted multiple other dinners and parties during the time the couple lived there. When the occupation ended, Vidkun was arrested on 9 May. Quisling remained at Villa Grande until 15 May when she was ordered to leave. She then moved in with the widow of former Minister of Finance Frederik Prytz.Juritzen (2008), pp.232–233 == Trial and execution of Vidkun == After Vidkun was arrested in May 1945, Maria was without contact with him for two months when they were given permission to correspond and in August she visited him for the first time in prison.Juritzen (2008), pp.235 and 240 While Maria wanted to testify, in the trial against Vidkun when it started in August, he did not allow her to.Dahl (1999), p.393 Instead Vidkun's lawyer read several statements from her in his defense.Juritzen (2008), p.242 On 10 September, Vidkun was sentenced to death. His wife was deeply shocked and wrote letters of appeal to various authorities, including King Haakon, Prime Minister Einar Gerhardsen and Otto Ruge.Juritzen (2008), p.248 She also drafted an appeal to Stalin, underlining Vidkun's efforts for Russia, but the letter was never sent.Juritzen (2008), pp.250–251 On 13 October, the Supreme Court upheld the conviction and no pardon was given. When Vidkun was informed on 23 October that his execution would take place that night, he wrote a last letter to her and included a lock of his hair which she kept.Juritzen (2008), pp.257–258 She was informed the next morning and together with a small group of people held a memorial service in her home. She was not given access to the urn with Vidkun's ashes which was kept at the police station. == Police investigation and arrest == After Mrs. Prytz moved from Oslo, Maria Quisling was left without a place to live. The authorities gave her access to two rooms in \\"Villa Maihaugen\\" in Vinderen in Oslo which belonged to a man who was imprisoned for having cooperated with the German occupation government. Several other wives of the NS leadership got rooms in the same house, and Quisling and the others attracted negative reactions from neighbours and the press.Juritzen (2008), p.259 On 29 August 1945, Dagbladet had a headline saying \\"Why is Mrs. Quisling not in Prison?\\"Juritzen (2008), p.267 In the article, the journalist wrote \\"Nobody has more supported the Germans and the Nazis than Mrs. Quisling and she benefited in all kind of ways during her man’s time in power. It’s misguided politeness to treat her milder than other traitors.\\"Juritzen (2008), p.269 (own translation) In February 1946, she was summoned for questioning at Victoria Terrasse. She was asked about her background, her activities in Nasjonal Samling and her life during the occupation. In March, the police searched her home. Working on a theory that Quisling in May 1945, had encouraged Vidkun to armed resistance, they arrested her on 31 May 1946.Juritzen (2008), pp.270–271 The prosecutors dropped the charges of encouraging armed resistance, but she was charged with having been a member of NS, for having represented the occupation regime in her position as Vidkun's wife, for having encouraged Vidkun to use public funds to decorate their homes, and for having received goods the occupation regime had confiscated from the Royal Castle.Juritzen (2008), p.274 On 17 June, she met in court for a preliminary hearing (forhørsretten) where she explained herself and denied all charges. The court was open for the public and attracted much attention.Juritzen (2008), pp.273–274 She was released on 18 June 1946 as the court did not find grounds to keep her in custody. The investigation continued, but on 8 April 1948, Quisling was informed that all charges against her had been dropped.Juritzen (2008), pp.275–276 Historian Hans Fredrik Dahl has questioned why she was not convicted of anything, particularly since she was a member of NS. Ørnulf Hjort-Sørensen (28 October 2005) – Mye er gåtefullt Telemarksavisa. Archive ==Division of community property== Erling Skjalgssons street; where Maria Quisling lived for most of her life in Norway The division of Vidkun and Maria's joint spousal effects (Norwegian: fellesbo shortened bo) was handled by the Erstatningsdirektorat (Compensation directorate). There were huge assets in the bo, but also great liabilities in the form of compensation claims related to Vidkun's actions during the occupation. Some of the claims were disputed.Juritzen (2008), p.260 In May 1946, the bo sold the apartment in Erling Skjalgssons street for a smaller sum of money than Vidkun had paid in 1922. The bo also sold much of the home furniture; some of which Quisling claimed was hers and not Vidkun's.Juritzen (2008), pp.266–267 Maria demanded as Quisling's wife to get half the value of the bo. The directorate did not accept this, but accepted that she should get back everything she had brought into it.Juritzen (2008), p. 280 She obtained many letters of support, including from Odd Nansen, a son of Fridtjof Nansen who had been imprisoned by the authorities during the occupation. In 1950, the Compensation directorate undid the sale of the apartment in Erling Skjalgssons street and she got it back.Juritzen (2008), p. 279 She continued to provide letters that were meant to document which things she had brought into the bo. In 1952, Quisling got back all furniture and other items she claimed she had brought into the marriage as bo. A final settlement in 1955, gave her a further .Juritzen (2008), p. 291 == Funeral of Vidkun Quisling == Maria Quisling asked to get the urn with Vidkun's ashes in 1946. This was declined. She again asked in 1956 after the Chief of Police in Oslo had asked the government permission to throw the ashes in the Oslofjord, but the government declined both requests. However, a new request by Quisling in 1959 was successful and the urn was brought to her home in June that year. Quisling, Vidkun's cousin Margarethe Langaard (Conken) and priest Asle Enger held a small ceremony in Quisling's home. On 31 June, the urn was buried in the grave site of the Quisling family at Gjerpen churchyard. The ceremony which included the local priest was small and secret, and there was no inscription with Vidkun's name.Juritzen (2008), pp. 294–295 == Later life, death and legacy == Vidkun and Maria Quisling are interred at Gjerpen churchyard Quisling had all her life in Norway complained of various health issues and often spent time at recreation institutions. In the post-war years, her health deteriorated and she had frequent visits to physicians and psychologists. Her health problems included rheumatism, back problem, eye problems and depression.Juritzen (2008), pp. 297–298 As she aged, she had signs of dementia. In 1977, she was long-term hospitalized at Ullevål hospital and in 1978 she was moved to a nursing home at Uranienborg where she lived until her death on 17 January 1980.Juritzen (2008), p.304 She was buried in the Quisling family grave at Gjerpen Churchyard. A member of the Russian Orthodox Church, Maria Quisling had a Christian faith. In the 1930s, she had contact with the Oxford Group. In her later years she was visited by a woman from Oslo Inner Mission Society and when she was hospitalized, she had regular visitors from the Catholic Church.Juritzen (2008), p.303 In 1976, she decided in her will that her assets after her death should fund an endowment, Vidkun og Maria Quisling's legat,Dahl (1999), p.418 later called Maria Quislings legat, which should be administrated by Oslo Inner City Mission and each year give economic help to elderly people in dire economic situations. The basic capital is around . Money is distributed after applications before Christmas. She bequeathed documents from Vidkun to the library of University of Oslo.Dahl (1999), p.417 The executor of Maria Quisling's will was Finn Thrana, a supreme court advocate and former Quisling regime official. == References  Sources == * * * Category:1900 births Category:1980 deaths Category:Russian Orthodox Christians from Russia Category:Kharkiv National University of Economics alumni Category:Imperial Russian emigrants to Norway Category:Members of Nasjonal Samling Category:Prisoners and detainees of Norway Category:Norwegian prisoners and detainees Category:Vidkun Quisling ","title":"Maria Quisling"},{"id":"46376554","text":"Semisalsa galilaea is a species of small brackish water snail with a gill and an operculum, an aquatic gastropod mollusk in the family Cochliopidae.

This species was previously known as Melaleuca citrina but was renamed to allow Callistemon citrinus to be moved to the genus Melaleuca. It is distinguished by its oval shaped, dense heads of yellow flowers and bushy foliage. ==Description== Melaleuca lutea is an erect shrub which grows to a height of about . Its leaves are a very narrow oval shape, long, wide, mostly glabrous with a blunt end. The bright yellow flowers are arranged in oval-shaped spikes, often on the ends of branches which continue to grow after flowering. The spikes contain 10 to 18 groups of flowers in threes, densely packed together, each spike up to long. The stamens are in five bundles around the flower, each bundle with 5 to 9 stamens. Flowering occurs in late spring and the fruit which follow are rounded, woody capsules long in tight clusters along the stem. M. lutea leaves, flowers and fruit M. lutea bark ==Taxonomy and naming== Melaleuca lutea was previously known as Melaleuca citrina, first described in 1852 by Nikolai Turczaninow in Bulletin de la classe physico- mathematique de l'Academie Imperiale des sciences de Saint-Petersburg. In 2006, Lyndley Craven proposed that all callistemons be moved to the genus Melaleuca. The move meant that Callistemon citrinus would become Melaleuca citrina. That name was already in use (a homonym). As a result, the name of the former Melaleuca citrina was changed to Melaleuca lutea. The specific epithet is a Latin word meaning \\"yellow\\" referring to the flower colour of this melaleuca. ==Distribution and habitat== This melaleuca occurs in heath and shrub from the Porongurup and Stirling Range National Parks to the Hopetoun district in the Esperance Plains biogeographic region. It grows in sandy soils on rocky hills. ==Conservation status== Melaleuca lutea is listed as \\"not threatened\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife. ==Use in horticulture== Melaleuca lutea is well known in cultivation (usually as Melaleuca citrina) in Western Australia, growing in a range of soil types. ==References== lutea Category:Myrtales of Australia Category:Plants described in 2010 Category:Endemic flora of Western Australia Category:Taxa named by Lyndley Craven ","title":"Melaleuca lutea"},{"id":"46376705","text":"The 562nd Air Defense Artillery Regiment was an air defense regiment of the United States Army.

The term was coined by Chuck Price in a post written for Search Engine Watch on March 9, 2015. The term was then adopted by webmasters and web-developers. The main effect of this update was to give priority to websites that display well on smartphones and other mobile devices. The change did not affect searches made from a desktop computer or a laptop. Google announced its intention to make the change in February 2015. The Economist found the timing \\"awkward\\" because they said \\"It comes less than a week after the European Union accused the firm...\\" of anti-competitive behaviors. In addition to their announcement, Google published an article, \\"Mobile Friendly Sites,\\" on their Google Developers page to help webmasters with the transition. Google claims the transition to mobile-friendly sites was to improve user experience, stating \\"the desktop version of a site might be difficult to view and use on a mobile device.\\" The protologism is a blend word of \\"mobile\\" and \\"Armageddon\\" because the change \\"could cause massive disruption to page rankings.\\" But, writing for Forbes, Robert Hof says that concerns about the change were \\"overblown\\" in part because \\"Google is providing a test to see if sites look good on smartphones\\". Search engine results pages on smartphones now show URLs in \\"breadcrumb\\" format, as opposed to the previous explicit format. ==Impact== Based on their data set, software company Searchmetrics found that the average loss of rankings for the non- mobile friendly sites measured was 0.21 positions on average. Content marketing company BrightEdge has tracked over 20,000 URLs since the update, and is reporting a 21% decrease in non mobile-friendly URLs on the first 3 pages of search results.

Bastardo del Grappa is a certified PAT cheese qualifying it as a genuine Italian product. ==History== The history of the semi-fat cheese \\"bastardo\\" dates back to 800 AD, a time in which it was produced in the pastures of the Veneto region. It is so named ( means 'bastard') because of the milk, with the addition of goat's milk in its composition, can not be turned into Morlacco cheese. Although the story also shows that the name derives from the fact that at one time it was also produced with goat, sheep and cow's milk. ==Areas of production== Bastardo del Grappa is a product related genuinely to the area of Monte Grappa massif and around Borso del Grappa, Crespano del Grappa, Paderno del Grappa, Possagno, Cavaso del Tomba, Alano di Piave, Quero, Feltre, Seren del Grappa, Arsiè, Cismon del Grappa, San Nazario, Solan, Pove del Grappa, and Romano d'Ezzelino. ==Process of production== After the milk is collected in the morning, it is left to rest overnight in a cool place. The fat is removed in a caldera of copper and the milk mixed, heated to a temperature ranging between , all in constant motion. Then rennet is added, which helps the whey from the cheese to coagulate into a large, soft ball. The procedure continues with the caldera reheated to . The curd is then pressed mildly in wooden molds, and purged for 24 hours. The dough is then allowed to rest for 2 to 3 days, when it takes a smooth texture. The cheese is salted in brine with about 15 kg of salt per hectoliters of water for a period of 4 to 5 days so that the taste is not altered. The maturation follows in a suitable room for 25 to 120 days, although it can go on for over a year. The weight can vary from 2.5 to 5 kg, the diameter from 25 to 30 cm, and height from 5 to 8 cm. The curing also brings changes to the consistency of the dough which becomes grainier depending on its maturity. The cheese said \\"bastard\\" is of a yellow pale to a light straw color, which can also vary according to its seasoning. ==Nutritional values== The nutritional values of Bastardo del Grappa range from 350 to 460 calories per 100 g, with proteins exceeding 20%.

During his time in the society, he wrote more articles for the magazine than anyone else before or after his time, over eighty articles from 1914 to 1949. He was known for traveling around the world whilst writing articles for papers and magazines, concluding with his 35-year stay in the Society, during which he wrote an award-winning article about Oklahoma, in 1941. ==Life and career== Frederick Simpich was born on November 21, 1878, in Urbana, Illinois, to Charles Frederick and Sarah Elizabeth Simpich. As a youngster, from 1878 to 1896, Simpich started his long career as a newspaper editor in large cities including Shanghai, Manila, and San Francisco, but later switched to magazines, including Saturday Evening Post, Nation's Business, and Argosy. In 1909 he temporarily forsook journalism to take a post with the United States Foreign Service. Literary work however, continued his principal avocation, and his first article, a piece on the Garden of Eden written from Baghdad, in the magazine was contributed in 1914, beginning a 35-year service with the Society. As a diplomat, he went to countries such as Germany, Turkey and Mexico, where he served as the U.S. Consul general, performing services to British, German and Chinese nationalists, during the Mexican Revolution of 1910. For his excellent services, he received official thanks from the governments. His years in the Foreign Service, from 1909 to 1923, were interrupted briefly in 1918, when he served with the U.S. Army Intelligence. Returning diplomacy, he became consul general in Guatemala in 1920, where he became a trade adviser and a member of the country's Division of Western European Affairs. Returning to literature, he contributed majorly to many American magazines during an April 1923 visit to Latin America. His full service with the National Geographic Society began in 1927, when he was hired by Dr. Gilbert Hovey Grosvenor to join the magazine's staff, and this is where he remained for the rest of his life. He went to various locations around the world, including Europe, South America, the Middle East, and Asia. He gathered all material needed for his articles, and all the photography was done by him. Upon becoming Assistant Editor in 1931, he focused mainly on publishing \\"biographies\\" of as many of the 48 States as he could, writing down information about their natural resources, people, cities, and landmarks. Almost all articles about US States from 1931 to 1949 were written by him. By the late 1940s, though, his health was failing. He formally resigned as Assistant Editor on October 31, 1949, and was replaced by his son, Frederick Simpich Jr. He also allowed Leo A. Borah to take over as \\"biographer\\" of the 48 states. Nevertheless, he continued to write articles for the magazine right until his death. His final article, So Much Happens along the Ohio River was published days before his death. On January 24, 1950, Simpich was preparing for a flight to Texas to work on an article about the state when he was diagnosed with a sudden and deadly yet unknown disease. He was rushed to the Garfield Hospital in Pomeroy, Washington, where he died the next day on January 25, 1950, at the age of seventy-one. A funeral was held on January 28. ==Legacy== Simpich is possibly the greatest writer about U.S. states that the Society has ever had, and as of 2015, remains the man who wrote the most articles in the history of the Society. He was well known and loved by all his colleagues. == References == Category:1878 births Category:1950 deaths Category:American male writers Category:American diplomats Category:National Geographic Society ","title":"Frederick Simpich"},{"id":"46376820","text":"Shawn Lamont McLemore (born May 3, 1967) is an American gospel musician and leader of New Image.

Adjacent to the church (north) is a 13th-century stone rectangular tower (bell/defensive/funerary) with sloped walls. It has small windows on the upper portion of the wall, but no access to the interior. The surrounding cemetery has been in use from the 6th century to modern times, and contains several interesting khachkars. A low-stone wall surrounds the complex and a section of the old cemetery. Dashtadem Fortress may be seen in the distance from the monastery. == Architecture ==  Surb Nshan Church  The Church of Surp Nshan is constructed of orange and gray tuff stone. Some of the stones on the southern and western exterior façades bear inscriptions in Armenian. A single compound dome is centered above the main body of the church, with an octagonal façade around the drum and dome. Light penetrates the interior of the structure via four small windows positioned around the drum, and two slightly larger windows above the entry and the semi-circular apse to the east. A portal to the west serves as the only entrance to the interior. Low-relief pairs of decorative columns stand at either side of the exterior of the entry, supporting a semi-circular arched lintel. The lintel has dentil ornamentation lining its outer edge. The interior of the church is unadorned and reminiscent of Kamsarakan S. Astvatsatsin Church found in the nearby village of Talin, within the Talin Cathedral complex. == Gallery == Image:Khachkar on way to Kristapori Vank.JPGLarge khachkar along the road leading to the monastery Image:Kristapori Vank 2.JPGGeneral view of the Monastery Image:Kristapori Vank Dome Interior.JPGChurch drum and dome interior == References ==  Bibliography  * * == External links == * Armeniapedia:Kristapori Vank Church Category:7th-century religious buildings and structures Category:Christian monasteries in Armenia Category:Tourist attractions in Aragatsotn Province Category:Buildings and structures in Aragatsotn Province ","title":"Saint Christopher Monastery"},{"id":"46376862","text":"Joe Bravo may refer to: * Joe Bravo (wrestler), Puerto Rican wrestler * Joe Bravo (jockey) (born 1971), American jockey ","title":"Joe Bravo"},{"id":"46376875","text":"Hispo alboclypea is a species of jumping spider (family Salticidae).

He was the son and heir of Iacopo V and his wife, Elena, daughter of Giacomo Salviati. He was a child when he succeeded his father, and was placed under the protection of the Emperor Charles V, while his mother presided over a council of regency.Luisa Bertoni Argentini, \\"Appiani, Iacopo\\", Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani, vol. 3 (Rome: Istituto dell'Enciclopedia Italiana, 1961). In 1548, Charles invested Cosimo I de' Medici. Duke of Florence, with Piombino in exchange for a cash payment. Iacopo and his mother fled to the Republic of Genoa, which intervened several times to prevent Cosimo from taking possession of Piombino. Iacopo and Elena then paid a visit to the imperial court, where, with the help of certain ministers opposed to the Medici, they convinced Charles to revoke his investiture of Cosimo, save for the island of Elba. ==References== Category:1539 births Category:1585 deaths Iacopo 6 ","title":"Iacopo VI Appiani"},{"id":"46376888","text":"The 1898 New South Wales colonial election was held on 27 July 1898 for all of the 125 seats in the 18th New South Wales Legislative Assembly and it was conducted in single-member constituencies with a first past the post voting system.

Adult numbers have been estimated at less than 5,000, making it one of the rarest wolf spider species. It is also believed to be one of the largest wolf spiders on earth, with a leg span for the female, somewhat smaller for the male (the Latin ingens means \\"huge\\" or \\"monstrous\\"). Coloration is grey and black with white spots on the legs. The spider hides under rocks and crevices on this volcanic island, but its habitat is being invaded by the grass Phalaris aquatica, while the native vegetation is damaged by introduced goats and rabbits. The spider preys on smaller relatives, millipedes and other insects, and even small lizards. It is capable of delivering a painful and venomous bite to humans. ==History== Hogna ingens was first described by John Blackwall in 1857, as Lycosa ingens. In 2016 a captive breeding programme was set up at Bristol Zoo with 25 individuals being captured and taken to the zoo, over 1000 spiderlings were produced in 2017 and it is hoped that some of these can be reintroduced to Desertas to boost populations. ==References== Category:Lycosidae Category:Fauna of Madeira Category:Spiders of Macaronesia Category:Spiders described in 1857 ","title":"Hogna ingens"},{"id":"46377110","text":"The 1894 New South Wales colonial election was held on 17 July 1894 for all of the 125 seats in the 16th New South Wales Legislative Assembly and it was conducted in single-member constituencies with a first past the post voting system.

The producers had assured the cast and crew that it was safe to film there. While they were shooting, a CSX freight train, with CSX AC4400CW locomotive #372 leading and C40-8W #7921 trailing, came around a corner at , giving the crew less than a minute to evacuate from the location, a substantial way out onto the trestle. The only escape route was toward the oncoming train. Video of the crew indicates that they were unaware how fast it was approaching; some attempted to remove camera equipment and the metal bed from the trestle. They failed to remove the bed before the train rolled through, and many of the crew were trapped out on the trestle. The train struck and shattered the metal bed, sending shrapnel toward crew members. Fragments struck camera assistant Sarah Jones and propelled her toward the still fast moving train, resulting in her death. William Hurt got off the trestle before the train hit the hospital bed. Several other crew members were injured and were taken to hospital. == Tributes==  Slates for Sarah  Several film crews began posting slates in tribute to Sarah Jones, starting with the crew of the television show Drop Dead Diva on February 21, 2014, and friends began to post tributes. On February 24, 2014, the Facebook page 'Slates for Sarah' was created to bring these tributes together in one place. With the statement \\"Sarah Elizabeth Jones, friend and family to so many, made every day awesome. Show your slate love here along with all the good stories of her life\\", the page went viral with photographs of crew slates from around the world. In less than 24 hours, 'Slates for Sarah' grew to 9,400 likes and included slates from It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia, The Vampire Diaries, Glee, Parks and Recreation, Castle, Hawaii Five-O, Brooklyn Nine-Nine, Criminal Minds, The Big Bang Theory, Halt and Catch Fire, Elementary, Scandal, Devious Maids, Justified, Downton Abbey, The Crazy Ones, Supernatural, NCIS, Arrow, Bones, and Rectify. In less than a week, the page grew to 63,000 likes and was supportive of the separate successful initiatives to have Jones recognized during the live Oscar telecast and for Oscar winners to wear ribbons on stage in her memory.  Television episodes  The episode \\"Still\\" from Season 4 of The Walking Dead, the episode \\"No Exit\\" from season 5 of The Vampire Diaries, and the episode \\"Cheers and Jeers\\" from season 6 of Drop Dead Diva were dedicated to Jones. A number of other tributes and memorials were held, including those hosted by Society of Operating Cameramen, the International Cinematographers Guild, and several unions. Vigils In addition to the memorial held in Jones' hometown of Columbia, South Carolina, a vigil was held in Charlotte, North Carolina, and a memorial in Atlanta, Georgia, where around 700 gathered to both remember how Jones lived and make sure her memory inspires change in the film industry. A candle light vigil was held in Los Angeles where over 500 friends and participants marched from the Directors Guild of America headquarters to the national offices of the International Cinematographers Guild on Sunset Boulevard for a memorial service attended by many members of the film community. Awards shows  An online petition campaign to include Jones in the \\"In Memoriam\\" segment of the 86th Academy Awards ceremony scheduled for March 2, 2014, achieved more than 55,000 signatures and was submitted to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.Hamedy, Saba (March 2, 2014). \\"Oscars 2014: Academy includes Sarah Jones 'In Memoriam'\\". Los Angeles Times. The campaign succeeded, and Jones was acknowledged in a graphic shown to the television audience after Bette Midler sang \\"Wind Beneath My Wings\\" as part of the \\"In Memoriam\\" reel segment. She was included in the Academy's gallery tribute on its website, and six Oscar winners wore \\"Ribbons for Sarah\\" on stage during their acceptance speeches. Jones was also remembered during the 'In Memoriam' segment of the Creative Arts Emmys on August 16, 2014, and by producer Harry Bring during the inaugural Locations Manager Awards March 29, 2014.  Walk-a-thons  Walk-a-thons took place on Sunday October 5, 2014, in Atlanta, Georgia, Santa Monica, California, and Central Park in New York City, to remember Jones and raise money for set safety. The Atlanta walk was led by Jones' family as well as cast and crew members of The Vampire Diaries and The Originals, including writer/EP Julie Plec and TVD star Paul Wesley. As a fund raiser for The Sarah Jones Film Foundation the walks had raised $35,000 as of October 6. == Reaction == While the tributes to Jones were of a very personal nature, they also became part of a larger industry wide call to address pervasive safety issues, and many notable representatives of the film industry made statements. Richard Crudo, President of the American Society of Cinematographers said as part of a larger statement, \\"As directors of photography, we have always been responsible for the safety of our crews, and it is incumbent upon us to find ways to be more decent and caring not only to them, but also to everyone we know.\\" He continued, \\"It won't always be easy; at times, it will run counter to initial impulses. But if our example proves worthy, it might make a start toward curing the spiritual sickness I have described. It would also stand as the most profound tribute any of us could offer to the memory of Sarah Jones.\\" Academy Award winning cinematographer Haskell Wexler said, \\"The Sarah Jones tragedy brings the public's attention to something that has been going on for a number of years, Sarah's father has said – and I agree with him – that the only way her death will not be in vain is if we pay serious attention to safety. We are making entertainment and there's no reason to risk our lives and our health to get a shot.\\" == A Pledge to Sarah and Set Safety app == A group of film industry veterans formed the group 'A Pledge to Sarah' to encourage film professionals to sign a pledge to dedicate themselves to promoting safe sets. The group also led a successful Indiegogo campaign to raise funds to develop a smartphone safety app to help address on set safety issues. The funding goal was exceeded in three-and-a-half days. On October 3, the app \\"Set Safety\\" was released for android users, and on October 14, it was released for the Apple iOS platform. The International Cinematographers Guild released a smartphone app \\"ICG Safety\\", on both android and iOS platforms, to similarly address safety issues on set. == Sarah Jones Film Foundation == While 'Slates for Sarah' initially focused on celebrating the life of Jones, it quickly became a rallying cry to address the many long standing safety problems on film and television sets. Jones' parents have said they will use the banner 'Safety for Sarah' to help keep this movement going forward. In September, Jones' family announced the organization 'The Sarah Jones Film Foundation' would be the umbrella organization for film scholarship programs; Safety for Sarah, set safety efforts; and 'Slates for Sarah'. ==References *Safety for Sarah website *Slates for Sarah facebook community Category:Safety Category:Film production ","title":"Safety for Sarah movement"},{"id":"46377130","text":"A penal bond is a written instrument executed between an obligor and an obligee designed to secure the performance of a legal obligation through the in terrorem effect of the threat of a penalty for nonperformance. == Types of Bonds == At its simplest, a bond need only state who is to be paid, what sum, when, and where (for example: \\"'Know all men etc. that I, AB, am firmly bound to CD in [$]n to be paid at Michaelmas next following'\\").J.H. Baker, An Introduction to English Legal History, 323 (4th ed. 2002) At common law, these bonds were nearly impossible to contest from the perspective of the obligor (the debtor).Edith G. Henderson, \\"Relief from Bonds in the English Chancery: Mid-Sixteenth Century,\\" 18 Am. J. Legal Hist. 298, 300 (1974). A simple bond can properly be considered a penal bond if it calls for the payment of a sum that is punitive in relation to the damages that would be caused by nonperformance. Historically, the most significant type of penal bond was the penal bond with conditional defeasance. A penal bond with conditional defeasance combined in one document the bond (the promise to pay a specified amount of money) with the contractual obligation. It did this in what the historian Brian Simpson called a ‘topsy-turvy’ fashion by printing the bond on the front of the document and the condition, whose performance by the obligor would render the bond void (referred to as the indenture of defeasance), on the back.Biancalana, Joseph, “The Development of the Penal Bond with Conditional Defeasance,” 26 J. Legal His. 103 (2005). At early common law, the penal obligations of bonds were enforced through an action of debt which was concerned with that penal obligation rather than the underlying agreement.Baker, at 324 In this sense, the enforcement of bonds in the period preceding the modern simplification of pleading was not concerned with contracts principles at all; rather, the enforcement of bonds was a question of \\"the law of deeds and conditions.\\" Id. ==Early history== The penal bond with conditional defeasance (hereinafter referred to as a conditional bond, conditional penal bond, or penal bond) first arose in England during the 1340s/1350's.Biancalana, supra note 3. The conditional bond has been characterized as the dominant method for “framing substantial contracts in the later medieval and early modern periods.” Id. In fact, during the Tudor Period, actions of debt were the most numerous single class of actions in the Common Pleas rolls (and would continue to be so for the next 300 years).J.H. Baker, An Introduction to English Legal History, 324 (4th ed. 2002) Although an innovation in its structure, the conditional penal bond was not the first English attempt to impose “fixed monetary penalties” for failure to perform on an agreement.Biancalana, supra note 3 Penalty clauses inserted into written contracts, a mainstay in civil law jurisdictions, as well as penal bonds with separate indentures of defeasance were commonly used to secure the performance of a contract until well into the fifteenth century.Id. Putting the acquittance on the reverse of the bond itself, however, had a number of advantages over its competitors: # It “prevented plaintiff [creditor] from pleading that the conditional acquittance or indenture of defeasance [the language which spelled out the condition upon which the obligation to pay the stated sum on the front of the bond was voided] produced by the defendant was not plaintiff’s deed.”Id. # Including the condition which made the bond void as part of the same document as the bond prevented the debtor from alleging outlandish conditions in defeasance of the bond.Id. # Compurgators were excluded.Id. # “Debtors could plead payment without a written acquittance.”Id. # “[C]reditors could not take advantage of the conditions of defeasance to avoid being repaid purposely to double the debt.”Id. # Courts were willing “to enforce the penalty to the fullest,” but were sensitive to offsets from payments that had been made.Id. # Penal bonds “could be made anywhere and without prior approval of royal officials.”Id. Joseph Biancalana has argued that there was no real advantage inherent in a conditional penal bond as against its competitors, and that therefore its later dominance was attributable to custom and trade practice.Id. Robert Palmer, on the other hand, has argued that “[t]he morality that allowed the extension of penal bonds after the Black Death . . . was part of the governmental concern to preserve traditional society by harshly coercing the upper classes to abide by their obligations.” Robert Palmer, English Law in the Age of the Black Death, 1348-1381 (1993) at 89. Irrespective of its merits, the conditional bond did overtake other forms of imposing a penalty for nonperformance of an obligation by the fifteenth century.Biancalana, Joseph, “The Development of the Penal Bond with Conditional Defeasance,” 26 J. Legal His. 103 (2005). At common law, the simple bond “was almost irresistible,” the only defenses available to the debtor being forgery or the production of a sealed acquittance in court.Edith G. Henderson, “Relief from Bonds in the English Chancery: Mid-Sixteenth Century,” 18 Am. J. Legal Hist. 298, 299-300 (1974). Debtors were not permitted to argue any other defenses including, “payment without taking of a sealed acquittance, payment at another time or place then specified in the bond, failure of consideration, impossibility of performance, or fraud in the underlying transaction.” Id. at 299 The debtor who was wrongly made to pay twice, however, could win damages in a writ of trespass for the taking.See, for example, Donne v. Cornwall, Y.B. Pas. 1 Hen VII, fo. 14v, pl. 2 (C.P.), reprinted in Baker and Milsom, Sources of English Legal History, p. 255 Conditional bonds were somewhat easier to contest from the perspective of the obligor. Courts considered performance of the condition a valid defense to the bond.Edith G. Henderson, “Relief from Bonds in the English Chancery: Mid- Sixteenth Century,” 18 Am. J. Legal Hist. 298, 299-300 (1974). By the mid- sixteenth century, the common law began to recognize a range of limited circumstances “in which non-performance of the condition was excused or a variant performance was held a sufficient defense against the bond.”;Id. see, for example, Abbot of Cerle’s Case. Before the mid-sixteenth century, however, substantial performance (unless accepted as sufficient by the obligee), partial payment, and late payment were not accepted defenses.Id. == Competition Between the Common Law and Chancery Courts == The common law was eventually made to compete with the Court of Chancery, which began to pass upon the enforceability of penal bonds. Barrantyne v. Jeckett (1553/54) has been cited as the earliest example of the Court of Chancery giving relief from a penal bond,Id. but by the middle of the sixteenth century, “Chancery was already intervening against penal bonds quite frequently” (34 cases being reported for study in the years 1544-1568, with probably as many passed over as routine, and some falling through the cracks as not recognizable as penal bonds in the records).Id. at 299 “By 1582 Chancery’s intervention was even more frequent,” including some 16 bond cases under consideration in the Michaelmas term alone.Id. Although Chancery was more favorable to the debtor, it still maintained a relatively strict line in these cases: injunctions were not routinely granted “simply on the ground that the penal sum was outrageously disproportionate to the underlying debt.”Id. The 1557 case of Chamberlayn v. Iseham,C 33/18 fo. 229, 29 June, 4 & 5 Phil. & Mar. (1557) illustrates this point. In that case, the debtor (now plaintiff in equity) had given a bond to pay a sum of £400, “defeasible if 20 marks (£13 s. 8d.) was paid by a certain date.” Henderson, at 300 Rather than grant an injunction barring the enforcement of the bond on the ground that the sum was grossly disproportionate to the underlying debt, Chancery “felt it necessary to mention special circumstances in the debtor’s favor,” namely that “he was in the service of the king and queen on the day appointed for payment, and had since paid the twenty marks into Chancery to be held for the obligee.” Id. During the mid-sixteenth century, Chancery sometimes viewed substantial performance of the condition as sufficient reason to justify intervention. This was the outcome in the cases of Rowse v. Wade, Fabyan v. Fuliambe, Atkinson v. Harman, Longe v. Awbery, and Walaston v. Mower.C 33/12 fo. 377, 7 May, 1 & 2 Phil. & Mar. (1555); C 33/21 fo. 295, 8 Nov., 2 Eliz. (1560); C 33/15 fo. 96a, 137a, 211, 253, 6 Nov – 31 May, 3 & 4 Phil & Mar. (1556-57); C 33/18 fo. 28, 28 Oct., 4 & 5 Phil. & Mar. (1557); C 78/33, case 17, 31 Jan., 4 Eliz. (1561/62). Beyond these cases, “by about 1562 Chancery was beginning to feel that the law of harsh penalties for small defaults was wrong in principle,” having held on a number of occasions that the defendant obligee could not recover more than his damages, notwithstanding the fact that he could have recovered at common law the entire penal sum irrespective of the amount he had been harmed (“damnified” in the verbiage of the time).Henderson at 304. This shift led Chancery to grant relief “routinely in a whole class of cases,” rather than just in exceptional cases.Id. Arguably as a result of this routinizing of chancering penal bonds, Chancery's willingness to intervene regularly in penal bonds (starting sometime in the 1580s/90's) shifted from giving injunctions without regard to whether the common law court had passed on the matter (which was the prior practice) to granting injunctions only during a set period of time.Id. at 306. Unsurprisingly, this caused friction between the common law courts and the Court of Chancery, which came to a head in 1614 over whether the Chancery Court could properly issues injunctions in cases upon which the common law courts had already passed judgment.For the entire story, see Samuel Rawson Gardiner’s History of England from the Accession of James I to the Disgrace of Chief-Justice Coke, 1603-1616, pages 271-283 (1863). In the case of Courtney v. Glanville and Allen, which grew out of a particularly egregious example of fraud underlying a debt, Chief Justice Coke, judge and leading advocate of the common law, sought to challenge the authority of the Chancery Court to review decisions already made by the common law courts. As the common law courts had already given judgment for Glanville and Allen, Coke argued that the Chancery Court could not properly rule on the case so as to give an injunction which ran contrary to the action of the common law court. Eventually, this particular dispute became wrapped up in a wider rift between common law and Chancery in the Earl of Oxford’s case, culminating in a stinging rebuke of the common law courts delivered by King James I, re-affirming the Chancery Court's right and duty to the people to review those decisions of the common law courts which may have been manifestly unjust.Id. == Later History and Decline == Chancery's dim view of penalties in excess of damages eventually won out. In 1696, Parliament passed a law, the Administration of Justice Act, which said that “a plaintiff suing upon a bond was allowed to execute on property only up to the value of the damages suffered as a result of the breach.”Nathan B. Oman, Consent to Retaliation: A Civil Recourse Theory of Contractual Liability, 96 Iowa L. Rev. 529, 540 (2011) (referencing the Administration of Justice Act, 1696, 8 & 9 Will. 3, c. 11 § VIII (Eng.)) In 1705, the law was amended to say that “payment of damages” was to be considered “a full substitute for the stipulated penalty under the bond.” Id. (referencing the Administration of Justice Act, 1705, 4 & 5 Ann., c. 3, § XIII (Eng.)). The penal bond, nonetheless, remained popular in the ensuing century \\"mainly because of procedural advantages – such as a longer statute of limitations – for actions on specialty contracts like bonds, vis-à-vis simple contracts.” Id. For bonds, in fact, there was no limitation period before 1833, although payment was presumed after a period of 20 years (reduced to 12 years in 1939).J.H. Baker, An Introduction to English Legal History at 325 (4th ed. 2002) As penal bonds were under seal, preference was also given to them over simple debts in the event of debtor insolvency.Id. at 325-326 Despite these minor advantages, the core fact remained that after “the limitation of the early eighteenth century, regardless of the penalty specified in the bond, the value of the underlying promise represented a ceiling on the plaintiff’s recourse against the defendant.” Oman, at 540-41. Curtis Nyquist reports that “[b]y the eighteenth century, chancering bonds was a regular practice on both sides of the Atlantic, even in common law courts.”Curtis Nyquist, A Contract Tale from the Crypt, 30 Hous. L. Rev. 1205, 1233 (1993). In Massachusetts, the practice was to give “judgment for only one-half the amount of the bond.” Id. This trend, unsurprisingly, “undermined” the “in terrorem quality of penal bonds,” and therefore penal bonds were “used less frequently and no longer played a major role in business practice by [1819].” Id. Despite this fact, \\"until the beginning of the nineteenth century,\\" \\"virtually all large business transactions\\" in the United States were conducted via the mutual exchange of two independent penal bonds.Morton J. Horwitz, The Historical Foundations of Modern Contract Law, 87 Harv. L. Rev. 917, 928 (1974). Over time in the United States, not only were penal bonds regarded as invalid insofar as they imposed liability in excess of damages, all contractual mechanisms that purported to impose a penalty in excess of damages (rather than valid liquidated damages) were regarded as invalid.See, for example, Tayloe v. Sandiford, 20 U.S. 13, 17 (1822)(where Chief Justice Marshall held that “[i]n general, a sum of money in gross to be paid for the non-performance of an agreement, is considered a penalty, the legal operation of which is, to cover the damages which the party, in whose favour the stipulation is made, may have sustained from the breach of contract by the opposite party. It will not of course be considered as liquidated damages; and it will be incumbent on the party who claims them as such, to show that they were so considered by the contracting parties. Much stronger is the inference in favour of its being a penalty, when it is expressly reserved as one. The parties themselves denominate a penalty; and it would require very strong evidence to authorize the-Court to say that their own words do not express their own intention.”) By 1895, the rule limiting relief to actual damages, and disfavoring penal bonds insofar as they purported to grant more than actual damages, was regarded a positive “[amelioration] of the severity of the common law,” and is aptly described in the case of Kelley v. Seay, spinning a story of progress in the law to the point where it was then regarded as a “settled rule that no other sum can be recovered under a penalty than that which shall compensate the plaintiff for his actual loss.” Kelley v. Seay, 41 P. 615, 617 (Sup. Ct. Terr. Okla.) (1895). Accord M'Intosh v. Johnson, 31 P. 450, 452—453 (Sup. Ct. Terr. Utah) (1892) (disallowing penalties when the amount of damages is reasonably ascertainable). ==Legacy== Although penal bonds have not been used for hundreds of years, their influence on English jurisprudence continued through the development of the common law rules in relation to penalty clauses.Professor A. W. B. Simpson, The penal bond with conditional defeasance (1966) 82 LQR 392, 418-419 During their review of this area of the law in Cavendish Square Holding BV v Talal El Makdessi the Supreme Court reviewed the relevant history and its effect on subsequent jurisprudence (noting that \\"[t]he penalty rule in England is an ancient, haphazardly constructed edifice which has not weathered well\\".Makdessi [2015] UKSC 67, at para 3. With the decline of the use of defeasible bonds the procedural mechanics developed in case law and Administration of Justice Act 1696 and later the Administration of Justice Act 1705 to protect parties became increasingly applied to liquidated damages clauses, which evolved into the common law doctrine of penalties. ==References== Category:Contract law Category:Legal documents ","title":"Penal bond"},{"id":"46377168","text":"Deep ocean minerals (DOM) are mineral nutrients (chemical elements) extracted from deep ocean water (DOW) found at ocean depths of between 250 and 1500 meters. DOW contains over 70 mineral nutrients and trace elements including magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca) and potassium (K) in their bio ionic form. To extract these products, DOW is treated with micro filtration and reverse osmosis to desalinate and concentrate magnesium, other minerals and trace elements whilst eliminating the salt (sodium chloride). Although research about DOM is in its early stages, as it is a source of electrolytes that can help metabolize carbohydrate, proteins and fat plus maintain bone, teeth and muscle function, health benefits are possible. The abundance of minerals and trace elements is also of note as deficiencies in macro minerals and micro trace elements can lead to premature aging, immune dysfunction and susceptibility to cardiovascular related diseases. The minerals and trace elements (DOM) present in DOW have three important functions: #Provide the structure to our organs, tissues and bones – calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, fluorine and sulfur. #The electrolyte form facilitates body fluid activity in tissues to maintain fluid balance, acid-base balance, membrane permeability, tissue irritability (including nerve transmission and muscle contraction) - sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium and magnesium in blood, all present in DOMs. #Magnesium alone, potentially catalyses up to 600 enzyme and hormone reactions. ==Sea water and holistic nutrition== Sea water has had a long history of therapeutic use, referred to as ‘Thalassotherapy’ it originates from the Greek word 'thalassa’. Both the Greeks and the Romans used the therapeutic effects of sea water for relaxation, regeneration and stimulation. Books on the healing power of sea water first appeared in the 17th Century and until the early 20th Century seaside holidays were both therapeutic and recreational. In 1897, René Quinton published the first comprehensive scientific thesis advocating the medical use of sea water in his book, Seawater Organic Matrix, 1904. He discovered the similarity between nutrient profile in micro algae ocean water and our blood nutrient profile. He noted that the ratios of minerals in both fluids were similar with the exception of sodium chloride, which he adjusted. Quinton selected sea water from regions which also contained micro algae. ==Ocean water profile== There are three distinctly different layers of ocean water - Surface Sea Water, Deep Ocean Water (DOW) and Very Deep Ocean Water. Each layer remains separate and autonomous from the others, moving at different speeds and directions from different kinetic forces and having different temperatures, densities and life form status. The surface sea water layer is influenced by sunlight penetration and circulates rapidly in unison with the seasons and wind patterns to a depth of 250 meters. It supports micro and animal life. The middle layer is DOW where the water is free of sunlight and life forms. It is characterized not only by its mineral density but cold temperature, cleanliness and trace elements. DOW is present at depths of between 250 and 1500 meters. This deep ocean current moves very slowly under the influence of density and temperature gradients. The high mineral density is attributed to the depth related pressure and the change in temperature from 20 °C+ at the surface to 8 °C at 600 meters depth generates the movement of this layer. Very deep ocean water has been discovered in a number of troughs in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Depths can range from 1500 meters to 15 kilometers and life forms are supported where volcanic processes bring heat and minerals to the seabed floor. DOM creation begins when the summer ice melts from both Greenland and the Sub Arctic region. The melting water collects minerals and trace elements during its journey to the ocean. The minerals make the water heavier (DOW) so the water naturally sinks to the ocean floor where it commences a 2000-year journey. It flows southwards down the Atlantic Ocean, moves around the African Cape and then inches north through the Indian Ocean and also into the western Pacific Ocean, first coming close to land at Taiwan, then Okinawa and Hawaii and then arching back south, towards the Antarctica where the changing sea water temperatures from the summer sun force the deep ocean water to the surface to feed the largest micro and macro food chain on our planet. The east coast of Taiwan is directly adjacent to one of the largest reservoirs of accessible DOW. The southern islands off Japan and Hawaii also have land access to deep ocean water. Taiwan´s East Coast is ideally located to siphon deep ocean water directly to the surface from the coast. It is then micro filtered, followed by reverse osmosis to desalinate and concentrate the magnesium and other minerals and trace elements at the expense of sodium chloride. ==Research== Over the past 15 years, there have been many new publications (over 40) establishing DOM as statistically significant with regards improved cardiovascular and metabolic function. Recent clinical research from Taiwan, Japan and Korea also shows statistically significant therapeutic health benefits from either topical or oral consumption of DOM. In 2009, scientists at the National Taiwan Ocean University, Keelung, Taiwan, published the first notable wistar rat treadmill fatigue study. Researchers used desalinated deep ocean water processed with ultra-filtration and reverse osmosis to increase magnesium levels and hardness. The water was sourced from the East Coast of Taiwan. The Study showed that the DOM experimental groups were significantly better than the control group with regards exhausting time and the ratio of lactic acid elimination to lactic acid increment. Summarizing the results, the researchers suggested that endurance, adaptation for exercising load and accelerating elimination in fatigue of rats could be improved when fed with DOM of higher hardness and quantity. In 2014 scientists at Hung Kuang University, Taichung, Taiwan, published a gerbil animal trial, endorsing the findings of the wistar rat trial and again demonstrating that profiled deep ocean water, significantly improved exercise performance in gerbils subjected to treadmill exercise. In 2013, Researchers at the department of Sports Sciences, Taipei University conducted a randomized double blind placebo controlled cross-over human study to evaluate the effect of DOW on time recovery from a fatiguing exercise conducted at 30 °C. DOM supplementation resulted in complete recovery of aerobic power within four hours. Muscle power was also elevated above placebo levels within 24 hours of recovery. Increased circulating creatine kinase (CK) and myoglobin, indicators of exercise-induced muscle damage, were completely eliminated by DOM in parallel with attenuated oxidative damage. Researchers concluded that the results provide compelling evidence that DOM contains soluble elements, which can increase human recovery following an exhaustive physical challenge. Over the last 11 years, studies show potential application of DOM for use as a dietary therapy for prevention and complimentary treatment of cardiovascular disease. In 2003, Japanese researchers published their findings regarding the pharmacological activity of DOM directly influencing the serum lipid values of cholesterol fed rabbits. In 2004, the same group also published new findings showing changes to LDL cholesterol in dietary induced hyperlipidemia rabbits, comparing surface sea water, DOW and a control group. The plasma LDL cholesterol level was lower in the DOW group than in the surface seawater group. Glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity was significantly higher in the DOW group than in the control group, while there was no difference between the surface seawater and control groups. The level of lipid peroxidation was also significantly lower in the DOW group than in the control group. These early findings suggested that DOW may be useful for the prevention of hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis compared to the surface seawater, and it was found that reduction of the LDL cholesterol level and enhancement of (GPx) activity were involved in these effects. In 2008, a Japanese research group used Hypercholesterolemic rabbits to examine changes due to DOW diet on cardiovascular Hemodynamics (blood flow and pressure). Systolic, diastolic, pulse and mean arterial pressures and total peripheral resistance were significantly lower in the DOW group than in the control group. The first human trial of DOM was conducted in Japan in 2008 with 16 male volunteers examining the effect of Nigari (natural salty sea or lake water) standardized on magnesium in a two way, randomized cross over study. The healthy subjects were given a fat load test prior to measuring effect of postprandial (after meal) hyperlipidaemia. They found that Mg supplementation reduced and delayed the postprandial serum and chylomicron TAG responses after fat loading. The data indicates that Mg supplementation may contribute to preventing the atherogenic process in healthy subjects. In addition a series of research papers from Taichung University, Taiwan were published. In 2011, mice trials confirmed similar results to the Japanese findings and concluded that electro- dialyzed DOW benefited high cholesterol dietary mice and recommended that standardized DOM should be pursued as a dietary food ingredient for cardiovascular health. Similar results at the Taichung Medical University were also published in 2011 for hamsters. In 2012, Taipei, a major human trial with 42 hypercholesterolemic volunteers were randomly divided into three groups: reverse osmotic (RO) water, DOM (Mg: 395 mg/L, hardness 1410ppm), and magnesium-chloride fortified (MCF) water (Mg: 386 mg/L, hardness 1430ppm). Serum low-density lipoprotein- cholesterol (LDL-C) was also decreased by DOM. Further, total cholesterol levels of subjects in the DOM group were significantly lower than those in the MCF water or RO water groups. In 2013, Taichung University researchers published an extended rat trial. The study indicated that 0.1 × DOM, 1 × DOM and 2 × DOM decreased the systolic and diastolic pressures in spontaneous hypertensive rats in an eight-week experiment. DOM has been shown to reduce serum lipids and prevent atherogenesis in a hypercholesterolemic rabbit model. The results demonstrated that DSW significantly suppressed the serum cholesterol levels, reduced the lipid accumulation in liver tissues, and limited aortic fatty streaks. In 2014, Qingdao Ocean University, China, published a paper showing when DOM was added to HepG2 cells, it decreased the lipid contents of hepatocyte through the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase, thus inhibiting the synthesis of cholesterol and fatty acid and recommended further investigation for treatment and prevention of hypolipidemic and other lifestyle-related diseases. The DOM research points to it having a possible, positive impact on cardiovascular health. However research findings from the Biomedical Research Institute, Kyungpook National University Hospital, Daegu, Korea also extend the possible dietary use of DOM as a treatment for metabolic syndrome. In 2008 the Korean researchers reported DOM could potentially be used as an anti- obesity agent by inhibiting adipocyte differentiation, mediated through the down-regulated expression of adipogenic transcription factors and adipocyte specific proteins. In 2009, the same Korean researchers published a further study on the anti-obesity and anti-diabetic effects of DOM in obese mice. The control group received tap water and the experimental group received DOM of hardness 1000 for 84 days. The DOM fed group compared to control group reported a 7% body weight decrease, reduced plasma glucose levels by 35.4% and significant increase of glucose disposal after 84 days. The research suggests that the anti-diabetic and anti-obesity activities of DOM were mediated by modulating the expression of diabetes and obesity specific molecules. Taken together, these results provide a possibility that continuous intake of DOM can be of dietary therapeutic value for treatment of obesity and diabetes. In 2013, a further diabetes induced mice study was conducted to establish dosage regimes. The researchers concluded that DOM provided a novel activator for glucose uptake. ==References== Category:Nutrients Category:Dietary minerals ","title":"Deep ocean minerals"},{"id":"46377234","text":"This is a list of urban agglomerations and cities of Uttarakhand with a population above 100,000 as per 2011 Census of India: {class=\\"sortable \\" center;font-size: 9pt\\" - !rowspan=\\"1\\"Rank !width=\\"150\\" rowspan=\\"1\\" Name !width=\\"150\\" rowspan=\\"1\\" District !rowspan=\\"1\\"Type* !rowspan=\\"1\\"Image !rowspan=\\"1\\"Population 2011 !rowspan=\\"1\\"Male !rowspan=\\"1\\"Female !width=\\"90\\" rowspan=\\"1\\"Population below 5 yrs !width=\\"90\\" rowspan=\\"1\\"Literacy Rate - align=\\"right\\"1 align=leftDehradun align=leftDehradun UA 125px align=\\"right\\"714,223 align=\\"right\\"377,174 align=\\"right\\"337,049 align=\\"right\\"72,859 align=\\"right\\"90.01 - align=\\"right\\"2 align=leftHaldwani-cum-Kathgodam align=leftNainital UA 125px align=\\"right\\"352,060 align=\\"right\\"191,363 align=\\"right\\"180,697 align=\\"right\\"67,906 align=\\"right\\"85.17 - align=\\"right\\"3 align=leftHaridwar align=leftHaridwar UA 125px align=\\"right\\"310,582 align=\\"right\\"165,667 align=\\"right\\"144,895 align=\\"right\\"36,319 align=\\"right\\"85.43 - align=\\"right\\"4 align=leftRoorkee align=leftHaridwar UA 125px align=\\"right\\"273,502 align=\\"right\\"148,042 align=\\"right\\"125,460 align=\\"right\\"32,729 align=\\"right\\"84.29 - - align=\\"right\\"5 align=leftRudrapur align=leftUdham Singh Nagar UA 125px align=\\"right\\"154,485 align=\\"right\\"81,527 align=\\"right\\"72,958 align=\\"right\\"21,443 align=\\"right\\"74.91 - align=\\"right\\"6 align=leftKashipur align=leftUdham Singh Nagar City 125px align=\\"right\\"121,610 align=\\"right\\"63,625 align=\\"right\\"57,985 align=\\"right\\"14,381 align=\\"right\\"83.40 - align=\\"right\\"7 align=leftRishikesh align=leftDehradun UA 125px align=\\"right\\"102,138 align=\\"right\\"54,466 align=\\"right\\"47,692 align=\\"right\\"11,507 align=\\"right\\"86.86 - } ==Urban Agglomeration== In the census of India 2011, an Urban Agglomeration has been defined as follows: \\"An urban agglomeration is a continuous urban spread constituting a town and its adjoining outgrowths, or two or more physically contiguous towns together with or without outgrowths of such towns.

Wehle State Park is a state park on the eastern shore of Lake Ontario in the town of Henderson in Jefferson County, New York, United States. ==History== Between 1895 and 1947, the property was used by the United States Armed Forces as a training grounds, and was known as the Stony Point Rifle Range. The rifle range was used by Madison Barracks, Fort Ontario, and Pine Camp, now known as Fort Drum. The site was also used for artillery training, anti-aircraft training, and temporarily used as a landing field. Remnants of the site's military history are still visible at the park today. The property was purchased in 1947 by Rochester car dealer Thomas Nagle and Genesee Brewing Company owner Louis A. Wehle for use as a Hereford cattle ranch. Louis Wehle's son, Robert G. Wehle, acquired the property in 1968. Robert G. Wehle was an avid conservationist, sculptor and breeder of English pointers, and founder of Elhew Kennels. Wehle used the property as a summer home and kennel. Several of Wehle's pointer sculptures can be found in the park, as well as dog kennels, and a dog cemetery. Prior to his death in 2002, he arranged for the property to be sold to the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, who purchased the parkland for $2.8 million. The park was opened to the public in 2004. ==Park facilities== The park features multiple use trails for hiking, mountain biking, cross-country skiing and snowshoeing. Fishing is allowed in the park. Facilities for tennis and volleyball are available. Hunting is permitted in limited areas of the park. Approximately of Lake Ontario shoreline, some of which is fronted by limestone cliffs up to high, is accessible within the park. The park has an area for picnicking with ten picnic tables. The facility is located 1.2 miles from the parking area and is not accessible by car. In addition to picnic tables, there is an on-site outdoor grill, as well as a composting toilet, and beach access. Several buildings, including Wehle's former summer home and studio, are available as short-term rentals. == Trails == There are a total of thirteen trails in the park and all are named after Wehle's Elhew Kennels pointers. The longest trail, Snakefoot Trail is 4.9 miles, and the shortest, Jubilee Trail, is .12 miles. The trails are easy with little to no elevation gain, and relatively well marked. Trail markers are color-coded, illustrated with a pointer, and the name of the trail. Dogs are allowed on-leash throughout the park and on the trails. The trails are: Bobolink Trail-blue-.64 miles Dancing Gypsy Trail-green- 1.87 miles Huckleberry Trail-purple-.64 miles Jubilee Trail-pink-.12 miles Jungle Trail-brown- .86 miles Kiwi Trail-dark pink-.42 miles Knickerbocker Trail—black-.51 miles Marksmen Trail—red-1.4 miles Midge Trail-dark green-.98 milesRobert G Wehle sculpture, PointerMisty Trail—white-.32 miles Snakefoot Trail-yellow—4.9 miles Tut Trail –light green-.32 miles Zeus Trail—light blue-.51 miles == Geology == The bedrock of the park consists primarily of Ordovician Period Rocks, as well as Lorraine, Trenton, and Black River Group, which can be seen in the dolomite and limestone shoreline. Other rocks in the park include siltstones, sandstones, and shale. Areas on the Snakefoot trail offer a good example of the limestone shelves on the shoreline of the park, as well as the limestone cliffs. == Flora ==  Invasive species  The park has a large-scale infestation of pale swallow-wort (Cynanchum rossicum) that it actively maintains via mowing to limit spread. Pale swallow-wort, from the milkweed family, is considered an aggressive invasive that out-competes native flora and alters the environment that it impacts. Users are encouraged to check their shoes, clothing, and pets for seeds to help prevent the spread of pale swallow-wort. ==See also== *List of New York state parks ==References== Historic spotter station on Snakefoot trail, Wehle State Park ==External links== *New York State Parks - Robert G.

He has described his upbringing as rough. He enrolled for medicine at the University of Turin at age 18 and graduated. In the mid-1980s, he began to train as a functional neurosurgeon at the University Hospital in Turin before being employed at the same venue. He worked for 22 years as a neurosurgeon (including being the Director of the Turin Advanced Neuromodulation Group) until his contract was terminated in February 2015 due to increased opposition to his work from multiple quarters. After his termination from the University Hospital, he was inducted as an honorary professor by Harbin Medical University. Canavero is married and has two children. He is a keen practitioner of Jiu-jitsu and has been described as an idiosyncratic personality. == Surgical career == Canavero has been described to have completed influential studies about central pain syndrome and Parkinson's disease. He started his work on head transplantation in 1982. After his termination of contract in 2015, he had collaborated with Xiaoping Ren of Harbin Medical University, who were already working on a similar locus. Canavero attracted media attention in 2015 after claiming to be very near towards the successful execution of a human head transplant and detailed out a rough version of the proposed surgical procedure. Numerous neuroscientists and surgeons had rejected the claims. Initially, he was notably against any experimentation on animals. The first person to volunteer for Canavero's procedure for head transplantation was Valery Spiridonov, a Russian program manager who suffers from spinal muscular atrophy, a muscle- wasting disease. However, Spiridonov later cancelled his participation.  Monkey  In January 2016, Canavero and his team issued a press release wherein they claimed to have performed a successful head transplant on a monkey who supposedly survived the procedure without any neurological injury and was kept alive for 20 hours. However, the spinal cord was not re-joined and the monkey was unconscious throughout. The release also claimed that they were experimenting on human cadavers prior to their scheduled human head transplant around Christmas 2017. The claims were widely criticized and dismissed. Arthur Caplan, a bioethicist, criticized their press releases prior to publishing in peer-reviewed journals and remarked it to be \\"science through public relations\\". Thomas Cochrane, a neurologist at Harvard Medical School's Centre for Bioethics, also criticized the press release for generating unwarranted excitement and commented that the operation was majorly about \\"publicity rather than the production of good science\\".  Human  In November 2017, Canavero claimed to have performed a successful head transplant. Writing in The Guardian in 2017, neuroscientist Dean Burnett noted that head transplantation procedures present challenges that are beyond the ability of currently known science and that Canavero has \\"offered no feasible explanation or science for his claims to be able to overcome these hurdles\\". Arthur Caplan, a bioethicist, has dismissed Canavero's claims, writing \\"Head transplants are fake news.

The lake is also home to the white-clawed crayfish, another endangered species. Glenade Lough and its immediate surroundings were designated a Special Area of Conservation in 1997. ==Ecology== The water quality was reported to be satisfactory with a mesotrophic rating. The ecology of Glenade Lough, and other Leitrim waterways, is threatened by curly waterweed, zebra mussel, and freshwater clam invasive species. ==Legend== Glenade Lough is a site for the legendary beast (or cryptid) the Dobhar-chú, a very large otter- like creature believed to inhabit the lake. A gravestone in a nearby cemetery commemorates the alleged killing of a local woman by a dobhar-chú in 1722. ==See also== *List of loughs in Ireland ==References and notes== Notes Primary sources Secondary sources * * Category:Lakes of County Leitrim ","title":"Glenade Lough"},{"id":"46377633","text":"Normanda is an unincorporated community in Jefferson Township, Tipton County, in the U.S. state of Indiana. ==History== Normanda was platted in 1849.

It is a contiguous wooded area clearly delineated from its surroundings. The woods is dominated by Scots pine, and deciduous trees include sessile oak, hornbeam, and beech. It has natural value in terms of its botanical features, terrain, and geomorphology. It was given the status of a protected landscape area in 1985.Pangeršič, Irena. 2009. Degradacija Udin boršta, največjega osamelega krasa v Sloveniji. AR. Arhitektura, raziskave 2: 50–59. == Extent == The Udin Woods encompasses nearly the entire area bounded by the road from Kranj to Golnik on the east, the old road from Kranj to Tržič on the west, the A2 freeway on the south, and Mount Križe (, ) to the north. ==Name== The area was attested in written sources in 1495 as Hertzogenvorsst, and in 1679–89 as Udenwald and Hertzogforst, literally 'duke's forest'. The Slovene name Udin boršt is derived from *vivodinj 'duke's' + boršt 'forest' (a borrowing from Middle High German for(e)st). The name of the hamlet of Udna Vas (< 'duke's village') has the same origin.Snoj, Marko. 2009. Etimološki slovar slovenskih zemljepisnih imen. Ljubljana: Modrijan and Založba ZRC, pp. 444–445. ==Formation== Arneš Cave (Arneševa luknja)The Udin Woods is a glacial remnant, as shown by its gravelly or conglomerate composition. The conglomerate is dominated by limestone material; pebbles of volcanic origin are less common. Karstification took place during the Holocene interglacial, when limestone terrace flooding provided good conditions for the development of karst under a warmer climate and with abundant water. During this period various karst features were formed: sinkholes, karst caves,Lipar, M., & M. Ferk. 2011. Eogenetic Caves in Conglomerate: An Example from Udin Boršt, Slovenia. International Journal of Speleology 40 (1): 53–64. and karst springs, which vary in their output but never go dry because a layer of impermeable Oligocene clay lies under the conglomerate. The conglomerate that composes the terraces is to thick. Springs appear at the contact points; their output is less variable than in Dinaric karst areas and they have a constant flow. The character of the karst in the Udin Woods is distinct from other karst areas in Slovenia. ==Features== Archaeological sites and caves The geology of the Udin Woods includes karst phenomena that have formed in the thick layer of conglomerate, especially caves up to long. The area was already populated in prehistoric times. The three most important archaeological sites had fortified hilltop settlements: the Arh Hillfort (Arhovo gradišče), Klemenc Hillfort (Klemenčevo gradišče), and Štucelj Hillfort (Gradišče na Štuclju). There are visible remnants of moats and elevated rings where wooden palisades protected the settlements. Some settlements also existed during Roman times, such as the Štucelj Hillfort, where the Romans built a guard tower. ==Notes * Category:Landscape parks in Slovenia Category:Ljubljana Basin Category:Forests of Slovenia Category:Geography of Upper Carniola ","title":"Udin Woods"},{"id":"46377647","text":"Racing Glaciers are an English rock band which formed in the summer of 2012.

The geysers could provide easy access for sampling the moon's subsurface ocean, and if there is microbial life in it, ice particles from the sea could contain the evidence astrobiologists need to identify them.

This water would remain liquid up to shallow depths in the order of even of tens of meters. 'tiger stripes' feature. The EnEx mission consists of a lander carrying the IceMole, and an orbiter with the main function to act as a communications relay between the lander and Earth. After launch, the lander and orbiter would perform the interplanetary transfer to Saturn together, using the on-board nuclear electric propulsion (NEP) to power electric ion thrusters. The lander would land at a safe distance away from an active vapor plume. The IceMole would then be deployed to melt its way through, while navigating autonomously around hazards, and towards a target subglacial aquiferous fracture at a depth of about for an in situ examination for the presence of microorganisms before potential biosignatures and biomolecules are degraded by exposure to outer space. The IceMole has a high energy demand that would be met by a cable run from the lander's small nuclear reactor providing 5 kW of electrical power.

He was born at St Andrews, Scotland, and died there. His golf career was highlighted by second-place finishes in The Open Championship in 1869 and again in 1878. Kirk also had a second-place finish in the 1870 Open Championship after winning a playoff against Davie Strath. Kirk played consistently well with nine top-10 finishes in The Open Championship beginning with a fourth-place finish in 1865 and ending with a second-place finish in 1878. ==Early life== Kirk was born on 9 March 1845 in St Andrews, Scotland. ==Golf career== 1878 Open Championship Kirk's best chance to win the Open Championship came in the 1878 Open Championship, held 4 October at Prestwick Golf Club in Prestwick, South Ayrshire, Scotland. Fellow Scotsman Jamie Anderson won the Championship for the second successive year, by two strokes from runner-up Kirk. Kirk fired rounds of 53-55-51=159 and won £5 in prize money. Details of play In stormy overcast weather with some rain—typical conditions for early October at Prestwick—James Morris took the early lead with a first round of 50. Anderson, Kirk and the English amateur John Ball each scored 53, to be three shots behind. Morris began the second round badly and finished with a 56 for a total of 106. Anderson, with a second round of 53, was tied with him, while Kirk and Tom Morris, Sr. were both two strokes behind. Morris was in the third group out and had a final round 55 for a total of 161. Playing a few groups behind, Anderson began his third round with two sevens, but thereafter played steadily. With Morris finished he was told that he needed to play the last four holes in 17 to tie with Morris. At the Burn Hole (the 9th) he holed a full iron shot for a three, followed that spectacular shot with a four at the 10th, and at the Short Hole (the 11th) his tee shot landed on top of the hill behind the green. The ball then ran down the hill and into the hole for a hole-in-one. A five at the last gave him a round of 51 and a total of 157. Kirk, playing in the last group, was still in contention. On the last green he was told that if he holed his long putt he would tie Anderson. The putt lipped out and he missed the return putt but his score of 159 was enough to give him second place. 1869 and 1870 Open Championships Tom Morris, Jr. was the best golfer in the world in the late 1860s and early 1870s and he exhibited his considerable skills in the 1869 Open Championship and the 1870 Open Championship tournaments. At this point in time he was beating his legendary father, Tom Morris, Sr., on a regular basis. In the 1869 Open Championship, Morris, Jr. won going away by an 11-shot margin and bested that effort in the 1870 Open by trouncing the field by 12 shots.

He is the former KOTC Heavyweight Champion. ==Mixed martial arts career== King of the Cage After going undefeated in his first three professional mixed martial arts fights, Johnson signed with King of the Cage and challenged Tony Lopez for his KOTC heavyweight championship on March 26, 2010, at KOTC: Legacy. Also being the KOTC light heavyweight champion, Lopez was undefeated his last sixteen fights, which marked Johnson's most experienced opponent at the time. Johnson recorded the upset, using his wrestling to defeat the much more experienced Lopez via unanimous decision and becoming the KOTC heavyweight champion in just only his fourth professional fight. Johnson made his first title defense against then prospect and future UFC light heavyweight champion Daniel Cormier at KOTC: Imminent Danger on August 13, 2010. He lost the fight and KOTC heavyweight championship in the first round via rear-naked choke submission, resulting in his first professional loss. Johnson rebounded from his loss to Cormier by defeating Boban Simic via unanimous decision on November 13, 2010 at KOTC: Infusion. Bellator In April 2011, it was announced that Johnson had signed with Bellator, with his promotional debut expected to take place at Bellator 41 on April 16 against Carlos Flores. Johnson, however, was later replaced by Rudy Aguilar due to unknown reasons. Johnson eventually made his promotional debut against current UFC competitor Derrick Lewis at Bellator 46 on June 25, 2011. He won the fight via unanimous decision. ONE Championship After being sidelined for nearly two years due to issues with his Bellator contract, Johnson signed with Singapore-based promotion ONE Championship and faced former UFC heavyweight champion Tim Sylvia at ONE Fighting Championship: Rise to Power on May 31, 2013. The fight was contested at a catchweight of 271 lbs. after Sylvia missed weight. Johnson won the fight via TKO due to a doctor stoppage in the third round after an elbow by Johnson opened up a cut on Sylvia's forehead. Johnson next faced Chris Lokteff at ONE Fighting Championship: Warrior Spirit on November 15, 2013. He lost the fight via split decision. Independent promotions Over a year later, on November 22, 2014, Johnson faced Robert Neal at V3 Fights: Neal vs. Johnson and won via TKO due to elbows in the very first round. Return to Bellator Johnson re-signed with Bellator and faced former Bellator heavyweight champion Alexander Volkov at Bellator 136 on April 10, 2015. He won the fight via split decision. Johnson faced former professional boxer Raphael Butler at Bellator 148 on January 29, 2016. Johnson utilised his wrestling to take Butler down and wear him down, before the referee stopped the bout in favour of Johnson, late in the third round due to punches (TKO). Johnson faced Cheick Kongo at Bellator 161 on September 16, 2016. He lost via majority decision.

Later that fall, he won the prestigious All-American 400 at Nashville's Music City Motorplex. He managed another hometown win at Columbus in 1996, leading all 200 laps from the pole. In 1998, though he only managed two wins (Orange County Speedway and Berlin Raceway) to Scott Hansen's seven, St. Amant was more consistent, and leading nearly twice as many laps as any other driver helped him claim the 1998 title. His 2000 championship was won quite similarly; domination and consistent Top 5 finishes placed the Winchester 400 winner nearly 500 points ahead of second place Kevin Cywinski. After playing second fiddle to NASCAR- bound rookie Johnny Sauter in 2001, St. Amant and Joey Clanton waged war for the 2002 championship. Clanton won the first five races of the season (winning nine overall) and ultimately led over 35% of the laps, but had several poor finishes during the year. St. Amant won just four times (all but one of the final five races) but had only two non-Top 10 finishes. St. Amant won the season-ending Winchester 400, but Clanton recovered from a late-race crash to finish third, defeating St. Amant for the title by 1 point, the closest points margin in series history. After the 2002 season, St. Amant and team owner Bud Gebben parted ways after claiming two championships. St. Amant would later join Frankie Grill's Grand American team, driving his historical #7 in Jani- King colors. After several mechanical failures, he would leave Grill's team early in the season and join Appalachian Motorsports. Even while resurfacing with a new team, good luck continued to elude him. While his 2003 season was already hitting rock bottom, St. Amant's season only got worse during the ninth round at Mansfield Motorsports Park. During the late stages of the race, he clipped the left rear of another car, losing control and spinning down the frontstretch. His racecar stopped with the driver's side facing oncoming traffic. His teammate, Stephen Leicht, swerved to avoid, but instead drilled into St. Amant's door. St. Amant suffered four broken bones in his lower back, bruised kidneys and bruises throughout his arms and shoulders, and was sidelined for the following race at Indianapolis Raceway Park. For the remainder of the 2003 and 2004 seasons, St. Amant did not win again in the ASA, with his best finish of fourth coming at Illiana Motor Speedway late in 2003. His last start came in September 2004: a 17th-place result at Minnesota's Elko Speedway. Upon the demise of the series at season's end, he sat 8th on the all-time wins list with 21 triumphs. He also won pole position 26 times, led 7001 laps, and is the all-time money leader with over $2 million in career earnings. ==NASCAR== St. Amant competed quite sparingly in NASCAR- sanctioned events. In 1994 he won the Pro Gold 400 NASCAR All-Pro Series race at Myrtle Beach Speedway, joining several other Midwest short track stars moonlighting in the Southern-based series. In 1995 he debuted in the new NASCAR SuperTruck Series, finishing 11th at Indianapolis Raceway Park. On the final lap, he was racing former ASA champion Johnny Benson for second place, but spun on the backstraight and hit a light pole (which went dark upon impact). St. Amant restarted the truck and took the checkered flag to complete the 150th lap (in the Busch Series race the following night Chris Diamond would hit the same light pole). In four more Truck Series starts, he never finished better than 25th. ==Hooters Pro Cup Series== After the ASA was discontinued, St. Amant joined the growing Hooters Pro Cup Series with Bullet Racing. Though not a dominant driver, consistency through experience (44% of his starts resulted in a top 5 finish) placed him no worse than ninth in his five full seasons in the series. He won only twice, at Lake Erie Speedway in 2004 and Salem Speedway in 2007, but better consistency than the dominant Benny Gordon took him to the 2007 Hooters Pro Cup Series Northern Division championship. ==Post-racing career== Since leaving the now CARS X-1R Pro Cup Series after the 2008 season, St. Amant has worked out of his raceshop located outside of Columbus. He has aided former Hendrick Motorsports driver Landon Cassill in various short-track events, as well as being a crew chief and driver coach for Joe Gibbs Racing development driver Cody Coughlin. Since 2014, he has helped 2-time CRA Super Series champion Travis Braden, including leading him to his second-consecutive championship in 2014. St. Amant planned to continue to aid Braden in the premier CRA division as well as some ARCA Racing Series events throughout 2015. ==Motorsports career results== NASCAR (key) (Bold – Pole position awarded by qualifying time.

Doleman placed sixth in the 1865 Open Championship. He placed fifth in the 1869 Open Championship and was third in the 1872 Open Championship. He is reputed to have been the first person to have played golf in Canada when he visited as a sailor in 1854. He was a regular competitor in The Amateur Championship from its foundation in 1885, making his last appearance at Royal North Devon in 1912 at the age of 73. His brothers John, Alexander, and Frank were also golfers. He is best remembered for having seven top-10 finishes in the Open Championship, including a third-place finish in 1872. ==Early life== Doleman was born in Musselburgh, Scotland, on 16 September 1838. ==Golf career== 1865 Open Championship The 1865 Open Championship was held on 14 September at Prestwick Golf Club. Andrew Strath won the championship by two shots from Willie Park, Sr. There were 12 competitors. Strath had the lead after the first round on 55, one stroke ahead of Willie Dow and Park, and two ahead of Old Tom Morris. Making his debut, Young Tom Morris scored 60. After two rounds, Park was in the lead with a total of 108 after a round of 52 with Strath a shot behind on 109. Both Dow and Morris dropped out of contention after poor rounds. In the final round, Park scored 56 while Strath took 53 to give him a two stroke victory. Doleman finished in sixth place. 1869 Open Championship The 1869 Open Championship was held on 16 September at Prestwick Golf Club. Tom Morris, Jr., sometimes otherwise known as \\"Young Tom Morris\\", won the championship for the second successive time, by 11 strokes from Bob Kirk. Just 14 players entered the Championship. Doleman improved from his effort in the 1865 Open Championship by finishing in the fifth spot. He posted rounds of 60-56-59=175. Tom Morris, Jr. dominated the championship, leading by three strokes after the first round, four after second and eventually winning by 11 strokes. After the first round Davie Strath and Bob Kirk were both three shots behind Morris. Strath was in second place after two rounds but finished with a 60 to finish third behind Kirk who scored 57. Morris's first round included a hole-in-one at the 8th hole and his total of 50 (6-4-4-6-5-5-3-1-6-3-3-4) was only one behind his record of the previous year. In the second round Kirk took four strokes in one bunker (the \\"Alps\\"), scoring 10, while in the last round he took three shots in another (the \\"Cardinal's Nob\\"). He had four twos over the three rounds. 1872 Open Championship The 1872 Open Championship was held 13 September at Prestwick Golf Club in Prestwick, South Ayrshire, Scotland. Scottish professional Tom Morris, Jr. won the Championship for the fourth successive time, by three strokes from runner-up Davie Strath, having been five shots behind Strath before the final round. He was just old. Doleman played impressively, finishing in third place with rounds of 63-60-54=177.

It is a bushy shrub with small, crowded leaves and bears a close resemblance to the commonly cultivated Melaleuca ericifolia of the eastern states. == Description == Melaleuca microphylla is a dense, rounded shrub growing to about high with glabrous foliage and grey or white papery bark. The leaves are arranged alternately, long, wide, linear to narrow lance-shaped and with a blunt or slightly pointed end. The flowers are white to creamy yellow and are arranged in small heads on the ends of the branches which continue to grow after flowering. The heads are up to long, in diameter and contain between 10 and 50 individual flowers. The petals are long and fall off as the flower matures.

His golf career was highlighted with a trio of second place finishes in the 1870, 1873 and 1876 Open Championships. In 1876, he lost the playoff to fellow countryman Bob Martin. ==Early life== Strath was born in St Andrews, Scotland, circa 1849, the son of Alexander Strath and Susan Reid. ==Golf career== Strath toured Scotland and parts of England in the 1870s—both on his own and with fellow countryman Tom Morris, Jr.—playing exhibition matches on his own account, without official sanction; this was the first time this had been done. He finished in second place in the Open Championship twice in 1872, and 1876. The Strath family of four brothers all died, except George, of consumption as young men. Andrew, the second son, was the Open champion in 1865, but David was the star golfer in the family. When in the autumn of 1878 he fell ill, he decided on the advice of doctors in the Scottish town of North Berwick to embark on the 84-day voyage to Melbourne, Australia, to recover. ==Emigration to Australia== No one in Scotland had ever been able to determine what happened to the 29-year-old champion who helped design the North Berwick course. Many people assumed he had died on the ship when he did not return to Scotland. It was later discovered that Strath suffered acute laryngitis on the voyage and arrived in Melbourne in a weakened state, dying just 20 days later. He died in a house on Royal Terrace in the Melbourne suburb of Carlton next to the residence of a Professor Halford, who had studied at St Andrews University in Scotland and eventually founded the medical school at Melbourne University. ==Death== Strath died on 28 January 1879 in Melbourne, Australia. He was interred in an unmarked grave in the Presbyterian section of the Melbourne General Cemetery. With the collaborative efforts of the golf club of St Andrews and the Golf Society of Australia, funding was provided to erect a proper stone grave marker for Strath in January 2006. ==Results in The Open Championship== { cellpadding=\\"3\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" border=\\"1\\" style=\\"font-size: 95%; border: #aaa solid 1px; border-collapse: collapse;text-align:center;\\" - eeeeee;\\" !align=\\"left\\"Tournament !1869 !1870 !1871 !1872 !1873 !1874 !1875 !1876 !1877 - align=leftThe Open Championship style=\\"background:yellow;\\"3 style=\\"background:yellow;\\"3 style=NT style=\\"background:yellow;\\"2 style=\\"background:yellow;\\"5 style=T18 style=\\"background:yellow;\\"6 style=\\"background:yellow;\\"2 style=\\"background:yellow;\\"T5 } Note: Strath played only in The Open Championship.

He was a member of the Gay Men's Chorus of Honolulu and competed at the professional level of bodybuilding, placing fourth in fall 2015. ==Life== Born in Patuxent River, Maryland to military parents and assigned female at birth, Ortega never considered any other career.

Military regulations used to deem \\"any proclamation of a transgender identity or gender-affirming clinical treatment to be evidence of a \\"psychosexual condition\\" or mental illness that makes one unfit to serve\\" according to The Advocate. Evaluated by an Army doctor, Ortega was determined to be free of gender dysphoria and deemed fit to serve. Beginning in 2008, Ortega advocated LGBT rights. He co-founded support organizations and lobbied with legislators, often using his open own personal experiences and performance record to help advance the cause for transgender and LGBT service members. In championing the repeal of \\"Don't ask, don't tell\\" (DADT), equal opportunity protections for LGBT members, acceptance of women in combat roles, and lifting the ban on transgender military service, he worked with the military chain of command and the ACLU. In 2011 the DADT ban against gay and lesbian military people was lifted, but still in place was a ban against transgender people from serving because, according to CBS News, \\"it is based on military medical regulations put in place before the American Psychiatric Association declared, in 2013, that being transgender is not in itself a mental disorder.\\" In August 2014 the Pentagon asked each military branch to reassess rules regarding labeling transgender troops automatically medically unfit, although other troops with medical conditions are not automatically disqualified. Echoing the removal of DADT, in February 2015 senior Defense Department officials confirmed that a new plan for the Army was being considered, to change the policy so dismissal was made only by the assistant secretary of the Army for personnel, a senior official. In June 2016, Secretary of Defense Ash Carter announced, \\"We're ending the ban on transgender Americans in the United States military.

He and his wife, Judy Lyman, were successful traders for a local Wall Street firm in New York City until an unhappy client planted a car bomb on their vehicle. The bomb killed Judy Lyman but Marcus survived with a piece of shrapnel from the explosion stuck in his forehead, penetrating his brain. The shrapnel was successfully removed but not without consequence: the damage had caused certain connections in Lyman's brain to no longer function. As a result, he lost his ability to feel emotion. He was sent to the Ravencroft Institute For The Criminally Insane, where he was treated by Dr. Ashley Kafka. Dr. Kafka was disturbed by Lyman and she found that there was nothing she could do to help his mental state, advising that he be held under observation indefinitely.The Amazing Spider-Man #655 Now calling himself \\"Massacre\\", Marcus Lyman escaped the Ravencroft Institute and began kidnapping hostages. He held the hostages in a building, killing one of them to prove that he was willing to do so. The police began attempting negotiations with Massacre.The Amazing Spider-Man #655 Having temporarily lost his Spider-sense,The Amazing Spider-Man #654 Spider- Man arrived on the crime scene in an attempt to free the hostages, but was barely able to do so due to Massacre's heavy artillery. Massacre managed to escaped the scene, though not before Spider-Man secretly placed a Spider Tracer on him. Massacre resurfaced not long after, kidnapping another set of hostages at his former Wall Street firm but Spider-Man arrived on the scene prepared. Now donning a bullet proof costume and magnetic webbing, Spider-Man was able to defeat Massacre and rescue the hostages. When asked about his motivations, Massacre admitted that he had no particular reason for committing the crimes he did. Massacre was sent back to the Ravencroft Institute.The Amazing Spider-Man #656 At the Ravencroft Institute, Dr. Kafka became increasingly afraid of Massacre, believing him to be her most dangerous patient. Her fears were realized when Massacre once again escaped Ravencroft, killing Kafka in the process.The Superior Spider-Man #4 Massacre then went on a killing spree, threatening to murder anyone who crossed his path. Massacre soon took hostages at a Burger Town restaurant and, in retaliation for an employee pressing an alarm button, murdered them. Massacre then tracked down the manager of the Phizzy Cola company (Burger Town being one of its subsidiaries) and offered to help fix Phizzy Cola's public image after the killings by continuing to murder innocents wearing the logo of Phizzy Cola's rival company in exchange for a large sum of cash. Fearing for her own life, the manager agreed to Massacre's offer. Because of all of the harm Massacre has caused to innocent civilians, the Superior Spider-Man (Otto Octavius's mind in Spider-Man's body) decides to end Masacre's killing spree by killing him with his own gun.

The 182nd Mixed Brigade (),Carlos Engel, Historia de las Brigadas Mixtas del E. P. de la República, 1999 was a mixed brigade of the Spanish Republican Army in the Spanish Civil War. It was formed in the spring of 1938 in Andalusia and had four battalions, the 725, 726, 727 and 728. Apparently this mixed brigade ended up in the last Republican zone behind the XYZ Line at the end of the conflict. But data are lacking regarding its final fate.Ramón Juan Navarro. Resistir es vencer: el frente de Viver en la Guerra Civil Española, lulu.com, p. 79 ==History== Northern Army unit In 1937 the Spanish Republican Army Chief of Staff had planned to form a 182nd Mixed Brigade made up from battalions belonging to the Carabineros Corps that would have been placed under the 56th Division of the XVI Army Corps as a reserve of the Northern Army (Ejército del Norte). However, in the summer of 1937 the isolated Republican territory in Northern Spain fell to the rebel faction and this unit ended up not being established. Latter unit On 30 April 1938 a new unit named '182nd Mixed Brigade' was established in Andalusia. It was placed under the 54th Division of the IX Army Corps of the Andalusian Army (Ejército de Andalucía). The commander of the unit was Militia Major Pablo Careaga Odriozola. When the 54th Mixed Brigade was disbanded its troops and materiel were integrated into the newly formed 182nd Mixed Brigade. On 12 June 1938, in the face of the imminent takeover of Castellón de la Plana by the Francoist armies, the 54th Division was transferred to this front in order to become part of the XIII Army Corps of the Levantine Army (Ejército de Levante). But when the 182nd Mixed Brigade arrived to the front line on 21 July the city had already been lost to the rebel forces. Since the situation was irreversible the 182nd Mixed Brigade withdrew southwards, seeking the protection afforded by the XYZ Line. It seems that this unit remained in this relatively less active area of the front, seeing little action until the end of the Civil War. Some members of the brigade managed to reach France,Ramón Rodríguez Caro - Todos los Nombres but the fate of many others is unknown. ==See also== *Mixed Brigades *XYZ Line ==References *182 Brigada Mixta; Cátedra Pedro Ibarra *Archivo General Militar de Ávila *La Guerra Civil Española y sus victimas *Copia digital - Biblioteca Virtual de Defensa Category:Military units and formations established in 1938 Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1939 Category:Mixed Brigades (Spain) ","title":"182nd Mixed Brigade"},{"id":"46378222","text":"Apple cobbler This is a list of apple dishes, that use apple as a primary ingredient.

It was the 11th Open Championship and the last to be contested for the Challenge Belt. Tom Morris, Jr. won the championship by 12 shots from Bob Kirk and Davie Strath. By winning for a third successive time Morris gained permanent possession of the Challenge Belt. The contest took place the day after the autumn meeting of the club.

The songs \\"A King Alone\\" and \\"Faces\\" feature vocals from the band members, while \\"Shadow in the Rose Garden\\" features vocals from Kelly Koval, which themselves are sampled from their earlier song \\"Promise Me a Rose Garden\\". ==Plot== A young boy, Milo, travels to the futuristic city of Metropolis, hoping to start a new life, but instead finds it to be an industrial dystopia, where workers work in factories to provide power for the King of Metropolis. (\\"Immigrants\\") The King has built a machine, called the M Machine, meant to pacify the citizens of the city and bring peace to Metropolis. (\\"A King Alone\\") In one factory, Milo works in the same place as Luma, a young woman who works on an assembly line and has resigned herself to her factory work. In a sudden moment of rebellion, Luma tries to convince the workers that there is a way to overthrow the King, which stops the entire assembly line process and causes the administration to kill multiple factory workers, including Milo. (\\"Faces\\") Luma takes the opportunity to escape the factory. (\\"Shadow in the Rose Garden\\") Meanwhile, three men, the Brothers of Wisdom, infiltrate the caverns of Metropolis in order to obtain control of the M Machine.

He appeared in a recurring capacity in Chicago Fire and as a main character in Chicago P.D., as the chief of the Chicago Police Department's Intelligence Unit, which operates out of the 21st District. Despite Voight's reputation as a suspected dirty cop and for using underhanded methods, he commands his unit's loyalty and respect. The character was initially introduced in Chicago Fire as a dirty cop who tries to cover up for his son and uses all means necessary to do so, including threatening Fire Lieutenant Matthew Casey, one of the protagonists of Chicago Fire. Voight's circumstances were eventually clarified with the creation of the spin-off Chicago P.D. However, he has a well-documented feud with Casey as a result of what happened between them and his interactions with the firefighters of 51 is marked by tension and suspicion, despite the fact that he manages to earn their grudging respect for his dedication to seeking justice for victims. == Relationships == Hank has a son named Justin whom he bails out in \\"Professional Courtesy\\" after he crashes into a van while under the influence of alcohol. As the result of Justin's recklessness, the boy (Mike Duffy), who was in the van, is paralyzed from the waist down, stopping him from playing hockey ever again. This incident marks the beginning of the tension between Hank and then-Lieutenant, now Fire Captain Matthew Casey (Jesse Spencer). Hank is widowed; his wife Camille died six years prior to \\"Now I'm God\\" of ovarian cancer. Hank's father, Richard, was also a Chicago Police Officer, who was killed when Hank was 8. While working a joint case with the NYPD Special Victims Unit, Voight and Cpt. Olivia Benson (Mariska Hargitay) establish a bond of trust and friendship despite their differing methods. == In Chicago Fire== This character was first seen in Chicago Fire as an antagonist. Voight's ruthless methods cause friction with Lieutenant Matthew Casey, a firefighter at the nearby Firehouse 51. Casey had arrived on the scene of a serious car crash where the driver, Voight's son Justin, had been drinking. The resulting arrest would have been a DUI with possible repercussions as the passenger in the other car had been paralyzed from the waist down. Voight had tried various methods to stop Casey from filing the report against Justin. First beginning with bribery (a new television set for the CFD) and escalating to physical threats towards Casey and his then-fiancé, Dr. Hallie Thomas. Voight attempted to have Casey injured or killed, but was arrested by Detective Antonio Dawson (Jon Seda) in a sting. While in prison he offers Gabriela Dawson (Monica Raymund) information on who shot Antonio, who was working undercover at the time. This was in exchange for a future favor, which Dawson reluctantly accepted. Internal Affairs (I.A.) later released Voight from prison and promoted him to Sergeant of the Intelligence Unit at CPD. Voight began working with Dawson and Detective Juiliet \\"Jules\\" Willhite (Melissa Sagemiller) to investigate a series of murders relating to pharmacy nurses. The case was related to a drug dealer named Thomas Cobb, whom Voight killed to protect Casey. Unfortunately, Hallie was murdered after accidentally discovering a drug operation at the hospital she worked at. Later in the series, he investigates a gang drive-by shooting which claimed the life of a young girl. Working alongside Dawson and Detective Erin Lindsay (Sophia Bush), Voight uses firefighter Joe Cruz's brother, Leon, who had former ties to the gang, as part of a sting. The operation ended with the successful capture of the intended gang lord, but also the deaths of two gang members. In \\"Category 5\\", when he wants Casey's help with an investigation into Jack Nesbitt, he knowingly turns his offer down, hinting there is still tensions between the two from the first season. Casey eventually agrees to get some intel after he himself notices something was not right. In the season 3 finale, Gabriela discovers that Casey has gone missing. == In Chicago P.D. == It is common knowledge in the Chicago police department that Voight is a suspected dirty cop for being associated with shady, unsavory characters in Chicago's underworld, breaking police protocol and taking bribes. It's revealed Voight has now and then outright committed and covered up crimes. However, despite his ruthlessness, his morally ambiguous and underhanded approach to police work, Voight is a veteran who is determined in getting the job done, is extremely dedicated to the victims of his cases, goes out of his way to protect and help vulnerable young people, and does have his fellow cops' and Chicago's best interests at heart. It is revealed that he is working with Internal Affairs using his dirty cop reputation as part of an operation to bring down high hitters in Chicago's crime world. Prior to his arrest in 2012, Voight served in the Chicago PD's Gang Unit for almost 15 years. He has worked with Detective Alvin Olinsky (Elias Koteas), who later transferred to Intelligence, and Detective Jimmy Shi (Mark Dacascos), who now heads up a deep undercover vice squad in Chinatown. It is revealed that a number of years ago, after the death of Olinsky's partner, Eddie Penland, Voight, Shi and Olinsky took the murderer, Browning, out to the docks and killed him by taking him \\"for a boat ride.\\" Voight has a strained relationship with his son, Justin Voight. This may be due to the fact that his job in CPD was demanding and occupied most of his time. Justin acts out (usually by drinking and driving or fighting in bars) and hangs out with the wrong crowd. More recently, Justin was involved as an accessory to the murder of a rival gang member by his corrupt friend Joe Catalano. Voight learns from Antonio Justin's involvement was that of an innocent pawn and allows the case to be buried. Voight then takes Justin out and forces him to enlist in the United States Army to keep him out of trouble. Voight then kills Catalano by drowning him in the river. While Voight struggles with his relationship with his own son, he has a tendency to help vulnerable young people. He took Erin Lindsay under his wing (and became her legal guardian) when she was a teenager and got her to stay away from drugs. She, in return, became his C.I. and later joined the CPD. More recently, he helped a 13-year- old boy named D'Anthony get out of the gang culture his older cousin forced him into. He later gives D'Anthony's aunt $4,000 to look after his basic needs. In Season 2, Voight learns that he is going to be a grandfather when he meets Olive, who got pregnant by Justin before he enlisted. In \\"An Honest Woman\\", Voight was beaten and kidnapped, along with Olive, by two criminals, and was threatened by them to open the safe he has in his basement by killing Olive. It was revealed that earlier, she had run her mouth to an old friend of hers and confessed that Justin had told her about his father's secret stash. Then later, her friend went behind her back and betrayed her. The friend ended up telling other people about Voight's money, and one of these guys approached Olive with a knife. He cut her, but not deep enough to actually hurt the baby. Just so she knew he was prepared to cut her child out of her if she didn't help them set up Voight. Hank tracks all the people involved, starting with painfully interrogating the friends, and threatening one of the assailants. After one of the assailants was killed by his colleague, Hank arrests the man and nearly kills him but settled for beating him and letting him be processed. At the end, he gives Justin the ring that formerly belong to his mother (that was stolen in the robbery but recovered) and encourages him to propose to Olive. Hank is friends with the 21st District's Desk Sergeant Trudy Platt (Amy Morton), and has a decent working relationship with District Commander Ron Perry (Robert Ray Wisdom), who had \\"six hundred reasons why he didn't want [Voight] to run Intelligence, but one reason why\\"—because he got results. However, his relationship with Cmdr. Perry's successor, Cmdr Fischer (Kevin J. O'Connor), is not nearly as amicable. In \\"Chicago Crossover\\", an episode of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, he interrupts an interrogation handled by SVU detectives Nick Amaro (Danny Pino) and Amanda Rollins (Kelli Giddish), to do his own way of interrogation (beating the suspect to tell what that person knows). Benson stops him and threatens to arrest him, but along the way she allows him to. During the course of the case, the two of them are able to strike up a friendship. In \\"The Three Gs\\", after working on the human trafficking case, he threatens the officer that filed an official complaint against Sean Roman. He offers him to go to a dentist under his financial help or threatens to beat him up. In \\"Daydream Believer\\", he threatens to beat serial killer Greg Yates (Dallas Roberts) to death after he kidnaps and murders Nadia Decotis (Stella Maeve), Intelligence's civilian administrator, and when he saw the crime scene of his two victims in the apartment building. At the end, when Yates was in holding, he relieves the corrections officer of his duty and roughs Yates up, insists he must feel what his victims went through and to never let his guard down. At the end of \\"There's My Girl\\", he demotes Kevin Atwater following an IAB investigation after he leaves a soda can with the suspect that led up to his suicide, and promotes Officer Kim Burgess to replace him. In \\"Born Into Bad News\\", he shows his concern for Erin Lindsay when she begins going back to the same person that she once was, and when her mother, Bunny, starts to show up back in Lindsay's life (hinting at the rivalry between the two). At the end, when he is pleading for Lindsay not to quit the department, she still sticks with her decision for her mother to step in. In \\"Start Digging\\", Hank is offered a meritorious promotion to Lieutenant by Commander Emma Crowley (Barbara Eve Harris) and the CPD brass as part of the new Chicago Police Superintendent's reorganization of the department that includes getting officers like Hank off the streets. However, before Hank could either accept or decline the promotion, his son Justin was assaulted and later died of his injuries, causing Hank to go on a revenge mission using whatever means necessary to find Justin's murderer. He has friends find and take the murderer to him at the silos, where he forces him to dig a hole and then shoots him. In \\"The Silos\\", he was brought back to the silos by Commander Emma Crowley and Internal Affairs detectives, to see if they can recover the body and get him to confess. When no body was found, he was quickly released and went back to duty. It was later revealed that Lindsay had moved the body prior to them getting there. In \\"Grasping for Salvation\\", a gun that was used in the murder of a boy was connected to a 17-year-old case that he and his old partner Detective (now Lieutenant) Denny Woods had solved. When he found out that Voight was investigating the case, he brings him up to the review board for disobeying a direct order. And when the suspect that Voight and Woods arrested was innocent, Voight tried to have him released. It was later revealed that Woods had altered evidence to get him in prison. At the season 5 premiere \\"Reform\\", he sees a psychiatrist after Lindsay leaves CPD to join the FBI. He has difficulty working with Lieutenant Denny Woods after he became the new independent auditor. He forms an alliance to Alderman Ray Price, when he becomes entangled in an investigation that involved Detective Halstead. In \\"Promise\\", he sends a gang leader (where his niece became one of the victims of a serial rapist and killer) information about a killer's identity and where he lives in order for him to exact revenge. In \\"Snitch\\", he became suspicious of Dawson when he was seen with Assistant State's Attorney Steve Kot in the parking lot. He told Olinsky to keep an eye on him and that he doesn't trust him. In \\"Fallen\\", he manages to get Woods' suspicions on him. In \\"Monster\\", he suspects that Ruzek was being a mole when Halstead gets investigated by Internal Affairs and when he asks Platt about the missing money. Olinsky gets Ruzek with him to take him to meet his \\"CI\\" but instead meets Voight, discovering that he was the mole. In \\"Rabbit Hole\\", Voight is angry about the evidence against him. While he can't do anything about the charges against him, Voight manages to conspire with Ruzek to take down Woods. With the meeting between Ruzek and Woods over, it was revealed Voight was there watching. In \\"Chasing Monsters\\", Voight is seen standing over the bridge overlooking a crime scene where the police are busy investigating below, when Olinsky arrives to meet Voight, who says \\"It's what we thought\\" and suggests they wait it out and get in touch with Lindsay to give her a heads up, as to what is going on. Olinsky assures him that he did the right thing. Denny Woods reveals that a supermarket was breaking ground on the old railroad property by a bridge but it was halted when builders found some human remains. They identified the remains as Kevin Bingham, the man who murdered Voight's son, Justin. Woods says the crime lab is working overtime to clear Voight's name in any wrongdoing and he has brought in the FBI and all hands on deck after everything Hank has been through. At the end of the episode, Voight sits at the bar where Woods finds him and orders him a drink. Denny tells him they found a slug with Bingham's body, but it turns out the slug matches the one that was shot at police during a robbery a few years back and it turns out, Voight was the one who made the arrest, but the gun was never recovered. Woods says they are getting closer and the way he sees it, it's only a matter of time. In \\"Ghosts\\", it was revealed that Voight has connections to the Ivory Tower. In \\"Payback\\", he gets the name of the witness, Ruben, from the Bingham investigation. In his own car, he sees the witness and an unknown man in what appears to be a transaction. He waits for the witness to leave, then goes to the second person involved. It turns out that Ruben was paying off his debt. He goes to find dirt on him but soon finds that he was a recovering addict trying to turn his life around and he was unable to go after him. In \\"Saved\\", he witnesses a girl, Hannah Cates, from his past getting into an unknown SUV with a man she met in the alley. He gives chase but he had to turn the car around when he hears gunshots coming from a local credit union building. He and Ruzek have just walked into a robbery in progress. But during the investigation, surveillance photos surface showing Hannah holding the gun. He assumes that she was forced into doing these crimes when almost everybody starts to doubt her. Like Lindsay, Hannah had a hard life but apparently she was on the wrong road and it was Voight's wife Camille, not Voight himself, who passed his card to Hannah. While barricading a car dealership building, Voight decides to go into the car dealership to handle Mike and Hannah himself. He's realized that she turned to Mike when he (and her aunt and everyone else) were not there for her. But before he can say more, Mike drags Hannah outside and both of them are shot dead. Voight holds Hannah's body and apologizes. Later, over a drink, he tells Olinsky about how Camille was one of Hannah's teachers. After Camille's illness, Voight had been checking in on Hannah until his own son Justin died, and then he forgot — so he blames himself for her death. In \\"Homecoming\\", Voight goes to Wood's home to broker a deal by confessing to the Bingham murder in order to get Olinsky, with ASA James Osha, there in person. But before he does so, Voight gets a message that Olinsky had been stabbed and rushes to Chicago Med where Olinsky had been taken. Upon arriving, he sees Olinsky being rushed by doctors to surgery and while bleeding out Olinsky tells him that he will take care of it himself. While waiting to see how Olinsky was doing, a surgeon tells him that he has died. Voight broke the news to the rest of his team in the Chicago Med waiting room. Voight found a confused James Osha, who just wanted to know why Voight had blown out and got an earful blaming him for what had happened. Voight accused him of screwing Olinsky by prosecuting his case, before storming into the jail director's office the next morning and giving him an even angrier tirade. Upon finding out who the killer was, by a corrupt corrections officer, Voight beat him up in a storage closet and left him bleeding, claiming the man had tried to attack him. Antonio did not buy the story, but Voight told him that if he didn't he could recuse himself from the investigation. The money that was left in the guard's bank account traces back to an Alberto Flores, who, through being beaten into talking by Voight, reveals the name of a man from the Cali Cartel named Carlos DeLeon. In the warehouse, Voight orders Antonio to go a different way from him so that he can track down Carlos himself, and confronts the other man on the roof. The unarmed Carlos begs for his life, but Voight shoots him twice anyway and says Carlos was reaching for a gun. But the two witnesses immediately exclaim that Voight shot the man ‘in cold blood’. Voight gets a phone call from Osha just before he offers his own story to his department superiors when the accusations became public. Meanwhile, Woods calls Voight wanting another private conversation. It was revealed to be a vendetta that was motivated by Voight leaving him out to dry in \\"Grasping for Salvation\\". When Woods mention that another ‘witness’ was there when the murder had occurred, it was later revealed that Voight knows all about Woods' new witness and how Woods just paid her off. It turns out that it was a setup and Internal Affairs shows up to his house. Voight lets them in so he can be arrested. Woods is hauled off in handcuffs, and Voight meets both the faux witness and Osha outside to thank them for their help. After this outcome, Voight drowns his miseries in a bottle and apologizes to a photo of Olinsky before breaking down on the roof. The episode ends with him screaming in pain. In the season 6 premiere \\"New Normal\\", he was briefly suspended by Deputy Superintendent Katherine Brennan for the shooting of Carlos DeLeon. While the investigation continues, he continues to help Ruzek with the investigation of people overdosing for bad drugs. At the end, Voight formed an unofficial alliance with Brennan after she agreed to clear Alvin Olinsky's name. Though Voight was asked, by Alvin's wife, not to show up at his best friend's memorial, he did make it possible for Meredith Olinsky to collect her husband's pension. In \\"Bad Boys\\", he had Olinsky exonerated for his arrest last season. In \\"Descent\\", he finds out that Antonio was addicted to painkillers when he witnessed him buying pills from a drug dealer. And at the end, after capturing the person responsible for kidnapping Antonio's daughter, he and Ruzek let Antonio beat him and things went sideways when he pushes him out of the window to his death. In \\"Brotherhood\\", before other officers respond to the scene, he tells Antonio to go and tell Ruzek to let him take the rap but it didn't fall into play when Ruzek offered to take the blame. He was infuriated by what he had done and almost got into an altercation with him. In \\"The Forgotten\\", his distrust towards Kelton grows more from \\"Trust\\" when he shut down the investigation of a serial killer that resulted the death of his longtime informant. It got out of control to the point that he got into an altercation with the detective responsible for shooting the killer. In \\"Pain Killer\\", he and Ray Price were targeted by a criminal that Voight investigated prior getting in Intelligence. In \\"What Could Have Been\\", he lets Ray Price take the fall for his wife when she killed Burgess's boyfriend and a reverend to protect her daughter. The two share drinks in a cell acknowledging that Price was so close to winning the mayoral election. In \\"Confession\\", he contacts Platt's old friend who works in journalism and shares that Kelton had covered up an investigation that allowed a serial killer to kill more victims, and convinced the detective working on that case to come forward. At the end, it didn't go his way when Deputy Superintendent Brennan took the blame for Kelton and resigned. In \\"Reckoning\\", Platt informs Voight, Ruzek, and Dawson that Internal Affairs had taken over the investigation as Kelton's way of trying to take down his unit. He vowed to fight back. Voight visits Brennan's home and confirms that Kelton is coming after the unit. Given 36 hours until election is over, he was given Kelton's weak link; a gangbanger by the name of Wilson Young as his \\"fix it\\". He assembles his unit to find him and take down Kelton. He takes it off book when Kelton directs them to a double homicide that homicide stalled. It took a turn when Young was found dead. He suspected that Kelton had something to do with his death when he shows to up to the crime scene and confronting him about knowing him, which he denies. He shoves Ruzek into the stairwell, ordering him to not go through with it as he is not Alvin. As he stands firm with his decision and leaves, he punches a wall frustrated that there is nothing to be done. Halstead confronts him about being in the dark and tells him that one day that he will run the unit and leaves, leaving Halstead confused and frustrated. At the end, Kelton is found shot dead and Voight is seen driving away from the scene. However, at the start of Season 7, it turns out that it wasn't Voight who shot and killed Superintendent and Mayor-elect Kelton, it was former Deputy Superintendent Katherine Brennan, who had finally realized that Kelton's plans when he became Mayor would destroy Chicago and decided he had to be terminated.

He remained in the Navy until his retirement in 1965. ==Pre-war== Dornin entered the United States Naval Academy in 1931. He was an outstanding athlete on the basketball and lacrosse teams, but made his biggest mark in sports as a football end or wide receiver, teaming with Buzz Borries and Slade Cutter to form a powerful \\"troika\\" (numerous sources state he was an All-American, though he is not mentioned in the 1935 College Football All-America Team or any prior 1930s teams). Both his teammates would also distinguish themselves in the coming war, with Cutter also making his mark as a submariner. Cutter would later recall that Dornin \\"studied all the time\\"; he graduated 48th out of 442 in the Class of 1935. After serving on the battleship (1935–37) and the destroyer (1937–38), he graduated from Submarine School (1938–39). He was a lieutenant aboard the submarine from 1939 to 1941. ==World War II== Admiral King and Commander Dornin (right front) at the Potsdam Conference, July 15, 1945 Dornin held the rank of lieutenant commander on from 1941 to 1943. After the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, Gudgeon left four days later on the first American submarine war patrol of World War II, with Dornin as the fire control officer. The submarine I-173 became the first enemy warship sunk by an American submarine, courtesy of Gudgeon. Dornin eventually became the executive officer. He was given command of in 1943. In September of that year, he left on his first patrol in Trigger, prowling the East China Sea north of Formosa. On September 17, Trigger sank the Japanese freighter Yowa Maru. Four days later, the tankers Shiriya and Shoyo Maru and the freighter Argun Maru fell victim to the submarine. Though faulty torpedoes had prevented an even higher score, Trigger concluded a very successful patrol, returning to Midway Island on September 30. For Dornin's next patrol, he departed from Midway on October 22, bound for the East China and Yellow Seas. On November 1, Trigger scored hits on two freighters, one of which was seen to sink, before being forced to dive to evade depth-charge attacks by Japanese escort ships. The next day, the freighters Yawata Maru and Delagoa Maru were sent to the bottom several hours apart. On November 13, Trigger located a convoy and sank the largest ship, believed to be a transport. The last victim of the patrol was the freighter Eizan Maru on November 21. Trigger reached Pearl Harbor on December 8. The third patrol began on January 1, 1944, targeting the Truk-Guam shipping lanes. On January 27, Trigger encountered an enemy Ro-class submarine. Neither managed to inflict any damage on the other before contact was lost. Four days later, Trigger sank the coastal minelayer Nasami and the converted submarine tender Yasukuni Maru. The patrol concluded with a return to Pearl Harbor on February 23. USS Trigger was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation for her fifth, sixth and seventh patrols. Dornin was in command of the sixth and seventh. With initial reluctance, after nine patrols (six in Gudgeon, three in Trigger), Commander Dornin became an aide to Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Ernest King, beginning in 1944; he accompanied King to the Yalta and Potsdam Conferences in 1945. The Joint Army–Navy Assessment Committee credited him with ten ships (54,595 tons) sunk in three patrols in command of Trigger, putting him in a tie among American submarine commanders for 15th-21st by number of ships; his first Trigger patrol was also rated the 16th most successful of the war by tonnage (four ships totaling 27,095 tons). ==Post-war== After Admiral King retired in December 1945, Dornin became Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz's aide. Post-war postings include: * Commanding Officer, (1946–47) * Assistant Director of Athletics at the Naval Academy (1947–49) * Commander Submarine Division 22 (1949–50) * Chief of Staff, Officer Submarine Development Group (1950–52) * Executive Officer, U.

Writing for BBC Music, Spencer Grady observed \\"The resultant pieces feel so alive that you can almost sense the pressure of Frahm’s fingers alighting on each key as these solemn improvisations begin to weave their magic. Their unrefined organic energy and resonance is undoubtedly due to the natural reverb of the old church in Berlin where this set was recorded\\". Rock Sound reviewer Joe Marshall enthused \\"The Bells is a consistently fascinating listen. Possessing a grandeur that never descends into pomposity and a restraint that could never be mistaken for bland aural wallpaper, this is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful releases you’re likely to hear over the coming months'. Not all critics were as generous. In his 3 star review on MusicOMH, Ben Hogwood said \\"The Bells is a mixed bag of accomplished piano pieces that could do with a bit more subtlety in those passages where the intensity rises. It’s those softer, more intimate asides that have the greatest impact, allowing the listener to truly connect with Nils Frahm and his message. And that’s where the simple beauty of the piano shines through\\".

Original soundtrack ==Reception== The Producers drew a solid average viewership rating of 12.5% and topped the Content Power Index (CPI) rankings. But it also received criticism from entertainment industry insiders regarding its verisimilitude, particularly in the drama's depiction of producers as the weaker party in dealing with celebrities, which they claimed is \\"highly unrealistic\\" unless top stars are involved. According to broadcaster and industry sources, The Producers has earned (): from TV commercials, from product placement and other sponsored advertisements (well above the typical for a 16-episode series), and in overseas sales to China. Despite its domestic and international popularity, however, KBS officials say it may log lower- than-expected profits due to the rising production cost, with the original budget at per episode and for the whole series, plus additional costs when Pyo Min-soo replaced Yoon Sung-ho as one of the directors.

Headquartered in Singapore, it also operates in Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Cambodia, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, Australia, New Zealand and Canada. Carousell is available on both iOS and Android devices. ==History== Carousell was founded in Singapore on 14 May 2012, by co-founders Quek Siu Rui, Lucas Ngoo, and Marcus Tan. The first item sold on Carousell was an Amazon Kindle e-reader for S$75. Carousell was subsequently registered as Carousell Pte. Ltd. on 2 January 2013. Carousell received its first investment from Quest Ventures. In November 2013, Rakuten, with follow-on investments by Golden Gate Ventures, 500 Startups, and a few other investors invested $1 million in Carousell. Subsequently, in November 2014, Carousell announced that it received US$6 million in investment from Sequoia India. In August 2016, Carousell raised $35 million in their Series B funding round by Rakuten Ventures, Sequoia India, Golden Gate Ventures, and 500 Startups. In October 2016, Carousell acquired Singaporean mobile-first used car marketplace and dealership tool Caarly. As of 2016, over 23 million items had been sold on Carousell and users had created over 57 million listings of new and used items for sale. Carousell has expanded regionally to seven countries, including Australia, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Taiwan. However, Carousell's expansion into Taiwan faces competition against headstart companies like Yahoo! and Ruten, which are already settled in the e-commerce market. In April 2019, Carousell acquired OLX Philippines after receiving an investment from Naspers. The company raised $85 million Series C funding in May 2018. The round was co-led by existing investor Rakuten Ventures and EDBI. Other participants included 500 Startups, Golden Gate Ventures and Sequoia India as well as new investor DBS. In Nov 2019, Carousell merged with Telenor's 701Search to creates a regional leader in online classifieds across 8 markets in Southeast Asia, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Mudah, Chotot and OneKyat which were owned by 701Search will retain their individual brands and platforms, continuing operations in Malaysia, Vietnam and Myanmar respectively following the merger. ==Partnerships and collaborations== In January 2013, Singapore Press Holdings' ST Classifieds announced its collaboration with Carousell. According to a Yahoo Finance article in August 2013, Carousell announced its partnership with Singapore Press Holdings (SPH) Magazines, a subsidiary of SPH, to create a mobile app called SheShops Marketplace, selling fashion and beauty items. On 21 June 2018, Carousell announced its partnership with DBS Holdings, Stripe and VISA, to launch CarouPay, a mobile payment service. In 2019, Carousell revamped CarouPay to launch Carousell Protection. Carousell Protection is its secure in-app payment feature that allows buyer and seller to make payment and complete the deal on Carousell, through credit/debit card or DBS PayLah!. Some features include that the payment be held by Carousell until both buyer and seller are satisfied with the transaction, and that buyers and sellers are given a platform to raise and resolve issues with their order in the app. ==Operation== Items are prohibited for sale on Carousell if they are illegal or they violate the marketplace's community guidelines. In the effort to curb COVID-19, Carousell has issued in-app advisories to refrain users from face-to-face transactions. ==Controversies== In a Yahoo Tumblr page, images of users posting photos or screenshots of their bad experiences they encounter on Carousell relating to scams, fraud and harassment have circulated on social media platforms like Facebook and Tumblr. Users of Carousell have also complained about cases of scams by fake sellers. The Singapore Police Force has reported that over 70% of e-commerce scams in 2018 took place on Carousell. ==References * Category:2012 establishments in Singapore Category:Online marketplaces of Singapore Category:Online retailers of Singapore Category:Singaporean brands Category:Retail companies established in 2012 Category:Internet properties established in 2012 Category:Singaporean companies established in 2012 ","title":"Carousell (company)"},{"id":"46379043","text":"The 2nd Wildflower Film Awards () is an awards ceremony recognizing the achievements of Korean independent and low-budget films.

The pictures were initially displayed in the long gallery at Ingatestone Hall. By 1600 the displayed paintings included a portrait of William Petre which remains at Ingatestone Hall. At that time it was the only family portrait on display. By the end of the 18th century, the collection was housed at Thorndon Hall - the Petre's newly built Palladian mansion. The collection included two works by Stubbs showing members of the Petre family hunting. In 1878, Thorndon Hall was extensively damaged by a fire which destroyed 23 pictures. Lost works included the Petre's large collection of royal portraits and a possible full-length portrait of the Earl of Portland by van Dyck. Many works were damaged, requiring them to have significant repainting. Following the fire, the family (and its picture collection) occupied the East Wing, but later moved to Ingatestone Hall. Among the paintings in the collection at the time of the fire was a version of the family of Sir Thomas More after Holbein that is now owned by the Chelsea Society. The collection remains on display at Ingatestone Hall and includes a portrait of Sir William Petre and of 15 of his descendants who bore the title Baron Petre. The exceptions are the 5th, 8th, and 15th Barons. In 1956, Sir David Piper prepared a descriptive catalogue of the family portraits in the collection for the Essex Record Office. ==Notes== Category:English paintings Category:Private art collections Category:Paintings in the East of England Category:Petre family ","title":"The Petre Pictures"},{"id":"46379102","text":"The real projective line can be modeled by the projectively extended real line, which consists of the real line together with a point at infinity; i.e., the one-point compactification of R. In geometry, a real projective line is an extension of the usual concept of line that has been historically introduced to solve a problem set by visual perspective: two parallel lines do not intersect but seem to intersect \\"at infinity\\". For solving this problem, points at infinity have been introduced, in such a way that in a real projective plane, two distinct projective lines meet in exactly one point. The set of these points at infinity, the \\"horizon\\" of the visual perspective in the plane, is a real projective line. It is the circle of directions emanating from an observer situated at any point, with opposite points identified. A model of the real projective line is the projectively extended real line. Drawing a line to represent the horizon in visual perspective, an additional point at infinity is added to represent the collection of lines parallel to the horizon. Formally, the real projective line P(R) is defined as the space of all one-dimensional linear subspaces of a two-dimensional vector space over the reals. The automorphisms of the real projective line are constructed with 2 × 2 real matrices. A matrix is required to be non-singular, and following the identification of proportional projective coordinates, proportional matrices (having identical actions on the real projective line) determine the same automorphism of P(R). Such an automorphism is sometimes called a homography of the projective line. With due regard for the point at infinity, an automorphism may be called a linear fractional transformation. The automorphisms form the projective linear group PGL(2,R). Topologically, the real projective line is homeomorphic to the circle. The real projective line is the boundary of the hyperbolic plane. Every isometry of the hyperbolic plane induces a unique geometric transformation of the boundary, and vice versa. Furthermore, every harmonic function on the hyperbolic plane is given as a Poisson integral of a distribution on the projective line, in a manner that is compatible with the action of the isometry group. The topological circle has many compatible projective structures on it; the space of such structures is the (infinite dimensional) universal Teichmüller space. The complex analog of the real projective line is the complex projective line; that is, the Riemann sphere. ==Definition== The points of the real projective line are usually defined as equivalence classes of an equivalence relation. The starting point is a real vector space of dimension 2, . Define on the binary relation to hold when there exists a nonzero real number such that . The definition of a vector space implies almost immediately that this is an equivalence relation. The equivalence classes are the vector lines from which the zero vector has been removed. The real projective line is the set of all equivalence classes. Each equivalence class is considered as a single point, or, in other words, a point is defined as being an equivalence class. If one chooses a basis of , this amounts (by identifying a vector with its coordinates vector) to identify with the direct product , and the equivalence relation becomes if there exists a nonzero real number such that . In this case, the projective line is preferably denoted or \\\\mathbb{R}\\\\mathbb{P}^1. The equivalence class of the pair is traditionally denoted , the colon in the notation recalling that, if , the ratio is the same for all elements of the equivalence class. If a point is the equivalence class one says that is a pair of projective coordinates of .The argument used to construct can also be used with any field K and any dimension to construct the projective space . As is defined through an equivalence relation, the canonical projection from to defines a topology (the quotient topology) and a differential structure on the projective line. However, the fact that equivalence classes are not finite induces some difficulties for defining the differential structure. These are solved by considering as a Euclidean vector space. The circle of the unit vectors is, in the case of , the set of the vectors whose coordinates satisfy . This circle intersects each equivalence classes in exactly two opposite points. Therefore, the projective line may be considered as the quotient space of the circle by the equivalence relation such that if and only if either or . ==Charts== The projective line is a manifold. This can be seen by above construction through an equivalence relation, but is easier to understand by providing an atlas consisting of two charts * Chart #1: y e 0, \\\\quad [x: y] \\\\mapsto \\\\frac {x}{y} * Chart #2: x e 0, \\\\quad [x: y] \\\\mapsto \\\\frac {y}{x} The equivalence relation provides that all representatives of an equivalence class are sent to the same real number by a chart. Either of or may be zero, but not both, so both charts are needed to cover the projective line. The transition map between these two charts is the multiplicative inverse. As it is a differentiable function, and even an analytic function (outside of zero), the real projective line is both a differentiable manifold and an analytic manifold. The inverse function of chart #1 is the map : x \\\\mapsto [x: 1]. It defines an embedding of the real line into the projective line, whose complement of the image is the point . The pair consisting of this embedding and the projective line is called the projectively extended real line. Identifying the real line with its image by this embedding, one sees that the projective line may be considered as the union of the real line and the single point , called the point at infinity of the projectively extended real line, and denoted . This embedding allows us to identify the point either with the real number if , or with in the other case. The same construction may be done with the other chart. In this case, the point at infinity is . This shows that the notion of point at infinity is not intrinsic to the real projective line, but is relative to the choice of an embedding of the real line into the projective line. ==Structure== The real projective line is a complete projective range that is found in the real projective plane and in the complex projective line. Its structure is thus inherited from these superstructures. Primary among these structures is the relation of projective harmonic conjugates among the points of the projective range. The real projective line has a cyclic order which is an important mathematical structure in showing that the real line is totally ordered and complete.Bruce E. Meserve (1955) The cyclic order is addressed by a separation relation which has the properties necessary for appropriate deductions. ==Automorphisms== The automorphisms of P1(R) are called homographies or projectivities. These automorphisms can be constructed synthetically as central projections or parallel projections and their compositions. In homogeneous coordinates, automorphisms are represented by the projective linear group , which consists of all invertible 2 × 2 real matrices with proportional matrices identified. The action can be represented by matrix transformation of projective coordinates: :[x: y] \\\\mapsto [x: y]\\\\begin{pmatrix}a & c\\\\\\\\\\\\b & d\\\\end{pmatrix}= [ax + by: cx + dy] . This is a group action, as the composition of two homographies is represented by a matrix multiplication, which is the group operation of . The restriction to the (affine) real line of such a homography is a Möbius transformation: :[x: 1] \\\\mapsto [x: 1]\\\\begin{pmatrix}a & c\\\\\\\\\\\\b & d\\\\end{pmatrix} = [ax + b: cx + d] = \\\\left[\\\\frac{ax + b}{cx + d}: 1\\\\right], where ad-bc eq 0. The group is triply transitive on the real projective line, meaning that for any two triples of distinct points, there is a unique homography that maps the first triple onto the second. For example, the triple is mapped by the Cayley transform x\\\\mapsto \\\\frac{x-1}{x+1} to the triple The action of this homography on the variable of Legendre polynomials provides the Legendre rational functions. The stabilizer subgroup of any point is conjugate, and thus isomorphic, to the stabilizer of the point at infinity , which consists of the matrices \\\\begin{pmatrix}a & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\b & 1\\\\end{pmatrix}, which map to . It is thus the affine group of the real line. Since , the automorphism group lies between the modular group and the Möbius group . ==NotesReferences== * Juan Carlos Alvarez (2000) The Real Projective Line, course content from New York University. * Santiago Cañez (2014) Notes on Projective Geometry from Northwestern University.

The 77th Division ()Carlos Engel, Historia de las Brigadas Mixtas del E. P. de la República, 1999 was a division of the Spanish Republican Army in the Spanish Civil War. It would be the last division of the loyalist forces to be formed. The 77th Division was a short-lived unit that was established in December 1938, shortly before the chaotic withdrawal and rush to the border that followed the Francoist Catalonia Offensive. The division was also not fully formed when it first saw action, for it included only the 245th Mixed Brigade. ==History== Incomplete formation of the unit The 77th Division was established on 31 December 1938 in Calella with the also recently formed 245th Mixed Brigade. It was placed under the XXIV Army Corps (XVIV Cuerpo de Ejército) of the Group of Eastern Region Armies (GERO).Carlos Engel (1999), Historia de las Brigadas Mixtas del Ejército Popular de la República, p. 228 The command of the unit was entrusted to Infantry Commander Rafael Durán Martínez, who also would be the short-lived division's only leader. In the last week of January 1939 the 77th Division, together with the 242nd Mixed Brigade —which had not been ascribed to any division—,SBHAC - Brigadas Mixtas del Ejército Popular, 242ª Brigada Mixta tried to establish a planned defensive line along the course of the Tordera River in order to halt the massive rebel offensive.Carlos Engel (1999), Historia de las Brigadas Mixtas del Ejército Popular de la República, p. 227 Line of Resistance Fiasco The units took position along the course of the Tordera River east of the Montseny Massif on 27 January. But the effort proved futile and in practice it became impossible for the Republican forces to put up any meaningful resistance. The young, inexperienced and ill-equipped 242rd Mixed Brigade —posted at the lower course of the river— was unfit for the battle. At the onset of the fight it quickly fell into disarray and was overrun. In the face of the powerful and steady enemy advance the 77th Division abandoned the defensive line and withdrew to the town of Vic, which it lost on 1 February. Meanwhile, practically all other Republican Army units were demoralized and were hastily rushing to the north towards the French border. In the midst of the chaotic retreat, the 77th Division was to all effects disbanded and data about its final whereabouts and fate as a military unit are unknown. == Commanders == *Commanders in Chief ** Rafael Durán Martínez ==Further reading== *César de Vicente Hernando (editor), Poesía de la Guerra Civil española 1936-1939.

She was a member of the first subgroup of the Hunt class and served throughout World War II before being scrapped in 1957. == Construction and Commissioning == Cattistock was ordered from Yarrows in the 1939 Build Program and laid down on 9 June 1939 as No. J1834. She was launched on 22 February 1940 and commissioned on 22 July 1940, Lieutenant Commander Robert Ewing in command. == Career == After her commissioning in July 1940, Cattistock was used as principle location for the filming of the Admiralty's Naval Instructional Film A63, \\"The Duties of the Helmsman\\" (1941). On active service, she first performed convoy escort duties in the North Sea from then to June 1941. She bombarded Dieppe with HMS Quorn and HMS Mendip on 26 July 1941, resuming convoy escort duties. In May 1944, Cattistock became part of Force G in preparation for Operation Neptune. During the landings, she escorted Convoy G1, which was composed of minesweepers. After arriving at the beaches, she deployed off Gold Beach with Bombarding Force K providing fire support to suppress beach defences in King Sector. Cattistock conducted convoy escort duties off Normandy and switched to patrols against E-boat attacks in July 1944. On 7 July 1944, she sustained slight damage after an E-boat attack.English, pp. 47–48 Cattistock steamed to Portsmouth for boiler tube replacement. She resumed patrol duties on 24 August 1944. On 29 August 1944, she intercepted German naval forces attempting to escape Le Havre while patrolling with HMS Retalick. In this action, she was hit 26 times. Her captain, Lieutenant Richard Keddie, was killed along with four other men and about 25 men were wounded. As a result of the severe damage suffered, she returned to Portsmouth for repairs. After three months of repairs, Cattistock resumed convoy escort duties. On 2 February 1945, she attacked and likely sunk a German midget submarine off Zeebrugge. In August 1945, Cattistock was transferred to the Portsmouth Local Flotilla and was paid off on 26 March 1946. She was sold for scrap after ten years in reserve in 1957. In June 1957 she arrived at the breakers yard of John Cashmore Ltd at Newport, Wales for breaking up. == References Publications== * * Category:1940 ships Category:Hunt-class destroyers of the Royal Navy ","title":"HMS Cattistock (L35)"},{"id":"46379191","text":"Milja Reinert Simonsen (born 11 January 1997) is a Faroese football forward who currently plays for Havnar Bóltfelag. == Honours == ;Havnar Bóltfelag Runners-up * Faroese Women's Cup: 2014 ==International goals== :Scores and results list Faroe Islands' goal tally first. {  center;\\" ! # !

The rebellion began when Sekarmadji Maridjan Kartosuwirjo, a nationalist who had resisted the Dutch during the Indonesian National Revolution, refused to recognize the new Republic of Indonesia. Instead, he proclaimed the establishment of the Islamic State of Indonesia on 7 August 1949. Kartosuwirjo led Darul Islam's war against the Indonesian government for 13 years before he was captured by the Indonesian Army in 1962 and executed in 1965. After he was captured, Kartosuwirjo issued orders for his followers to surrender, although some pockets of resistance remained in Southeast Sulawesi until 1965. ==Background== After the Japanese surrendered in 1945, ending World War II, Sukarno proclaimed the independence of Indonesia on 17 August 1945, and became the nation's first president. While the Japanese soon left the former Dutch East Indies, the Dutch returned to reclaim former colonies in 1946. Indonesian militias fought the Dutch for three years in the Indonesian National Revolution. One of the militias—the Siliwangi Division of the Indonesian Army, based in West Java—was led by Kartosuwirjo, who had initially supported the Japanese during their three years of occupation. The Netherlands and the Republic of Indonesia signed the Linggadjati Agreement on 25 March 1947.The agreement is named after the mountain village of Linggajati located near the modern city of Cirebon. The agreement gave the Republic control of the islands of Java, Sumatra and Madura, while the Dutch controlled the other islands. However, the Netherlands broke the agreement by launching Operation Product and invading Indonesian territory, and Kartosuwirjo called for a holy war against the Dutch. Under the Renville Agreement, which the Republic and the Netherlands ratified on 19 January 1948, all Indonesian troops withdrew and moved from West Java to Central Java (Jogja). Kartosuwirjo saw the agreement as a failure of Indonesian diplomatic strategy because it reduced the Republic's sovereignty. He therefore ordered his troops to engage in guerrilla warfare against the Dutch as a holy war to protect Indonesian independence. The revolution ended on 27 December 1949, after the Dutch–Indonesian Round Table Conference, in which the Dutch officially recognised the Republic of Indonesia. ==Beginning of rebellion== When Indonesia regained independence from the Dutch in 1949, Kartosuwirjo refused to disband his militia. He proclaimed the establishment of the Islamic State of Indonesia on 7 August 1949, and named himself as its imam. His group was supported by many Indonesians, including Daud Beureueh, the governor of Aceh, who would become the vice imam of the group in 1955. (Beureueh surrendered to the government in 1957.) Elements of the Indonesian Army deserted and joined Darul Islam. Kartosuwirjo also forged an alliance with Raymond Westerling, a former officer in the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army who was leading a rebellion, known as the Legion of Ratu Adil (APRA), against the Indonesian government. APRA was quickly defeated by the Indonesian Army in the army's stronghold at Bandung, and Westerling fled to Singapore in 1950. Former APRA soldiers who refused to surrender to the government joined Darul Islam. In 1952, Kahar Muzzakar, a former presidential guard of Sukarno, deserted and led a rebellion in Central and South Sulawesi. He initially wanted to create his own militant group, but instead joined Darul Islam in 1953. Darul Islam was also supported by other rebel groups that opposed the central government, like Permesta and PRRI. Members of Darul Islam had tried several times to assassinate Sukarno. On 9 March 1960, a Mig-17 of the Indonesian Air Force, flown by flight lieutenant Daniel \\"Tiger\\" Maukar, attempted to assassinate Sukarno by firing a 23×115mm round on Merdeka Palace. However, Sukarno was not in the palace at the time. Maukar flew his plane to Garut, where he was going to be picked up by another Darul Islam member, but the army captured him before he could escape. Maukar was tried and sentenced to death. Sukarno personally pardoned him and commuted his sentence to life in prison. ==Dissolution and aftermath== Starting in 1956, the government went on the offensive against Darul Islam. The group was severely weakened after its top leaders were killed or captured, and many members surrendered. The government regained full control of Aceh in 1957 after the local branch of Darul Islam surrendered. Factions in South Kalimantan disbanded in 1959 after their leader was killed. By 1962, there were only pockets of resistance in West Java and South Sulawesi. In June 1962, Kartosuwirjo was captured by the army in his hideout in Garut. He was tried, sentenced to death, and executed three months later in the Thousand Islands. During his time in prison, Kartosuwirjo ordered his followers to surrender. The last Darul Islam band, in Southeast Sulawesi, did so in 1965. Even after the group was dissolved, some Indonesians continued to support its ideology. Along with some former Darul Islam members, they formed the Komando Jihad, which evolved into the present-day terrorist group Jemaah Islamiyah. Additionally, in 1976, former Darul Islam member Hasan di Tiro created the Free Aceh Movement, which attempted to separate the province of Aceh from Indonesia. Di Tiro waged war against the Indonesian government for 38 years before finally signing a peace treaty in Helsinki in August 2005. ==References External links == *Kisah Istana Presiden Soekarno dibom Mig-17 TNI AU *The History of Darul Islam (DI) and Kartosuwiryo Category:20th- century conflicts Category:Military history of Indonesia Category:Wars involving Indonesia Category:Insurgencies in Asia ","title":"Darul Islam rebellion"},{"id":"46379349","text":"June Randall (26 June 1927 – 18 January 2015) was a British script supervisor whose career spanned over five decades and more than 100 film and television productions. She was most noted for being director Stanley Kubrick's \\"continuity girl\\" on A Clockwork Orange, Barry Lyndon, and The Shining and for her work on five of the James Bond films: The Spy Who Loved Me, A View to a Kill, The Living Daylights, Licence to Kill, and GoldenEye. == Biography == Randall was born on 26 June 1927 in London, England. When World War II began in 1939, Randall, then aged twelve, was sent to Australia aboard the MS Batory. She returned to England four years later. Soon thereafter, Randall sought employment at Gainsborough Pictures in the hopes of meeting actor James Mason after seeing him in an advert for his film The Wicked Lady. She did not get to meet Mason, but did manage to secure a job as secretary to the studio's Head of Production, Betty Box. Wishing to be on the studio floor, however, Randall took the lower-paying job of assistant continuity girl (now script supervisor). In this capacity, she worked on such films as Dear Murderer and Ken Annakin's Miranda. Over the next two decades, Randall monitored continuity on such films as Hell in Korea, X: The Unknown, Quatermass 2, Tony Richardson's groundbreaking Look Back in Anger, Circus of Horrors, The Long and the Short and the Tall, Roy Ward Baker's The Anniversary, and Terence Fisher's The Devil Rides Out. She also began working in television, including 35 episodes of The Avengers and 22 episodes of The Saint. It was on the latter that Randall met actor Roger Moore, who nicknamed her \\"Randy\\" and with whom Randall remained friends for the rest of her life. Randall and Moore later worked together on two of Moore's outings as secret agent James Bond: The Spy Who Loved Me and A View to a Kill. Although the latter was Moore's last film as Bond, Randall continued with the franchise, working with Timothy Dalton on The Living Daylights and Licence to Kill and Pierce Brosnan on GoldenEye. Randall also had a long-standing partnership with director Stanley Kubrick, whom she met during pre-production of his film A Clockwork Orange in 1970 She agreed to work with Kubrick not only on that film, but on Barry Lyndon and The Shining, as well, despite the director's notorious compulsiveness and perfectionism. Other films on which Randall supervised continuity include the cult genre favorites Captain Kronos – Vampire Hunter and Flash Gordon, Richard Attenborough's Academy Award-winning Gandhi, Michael Mann's crime thriller Manhunter, and David Fincher's Alien³. She retired in 2001 and died in London on 18 January 2015, at the age of 87. == References  External links == * Category:1927 births Category:Script supervisors Category:2015 deaths Category:Film people from London ","title":"June Randall"},{"id":"46379367","text":"1984 Kokkilai massacres refers to a series of massacres of Sri Lankan Tamil civilians when the Sri Lankan military attacked the village of Kokkilai and several neighboring villages in Mullaitivu District, Northern Province, Sri Lanka. The attack left several civilians including women and children dead and their property destroyed. The attacks resulted in widespread displacement of native residents and subsequently their lands were colonized by Sinhala settlers. ==Incident== On 15 December 1984, a large number of Sri Lankan military troops entered the coastal villages of Kokkilai, Kokkuthoduvai, Alampil, Nayaru and Kumulamunai in Mullaitivu District. The Sri Lankan Army arrived and announced that several villages were to vacate within 24 hours. Entire villages in the region such as Kokkilai, Kokkuthuduvai, Karnaddu kerni and Koddai Keri amongst others were ordered to vacate within a day’s time. The military then began killing people and destroying property. 131 civilians were killed including 31 women and 21 children. More than 2,000 families were forced to relocate following the attacks and subsequent colonisation attempts of their lands by the Sinhala population. They remain displaced to this date. ==State colonization of Tamil areas== The Kokkilai massacres has come to be viewed as a part of the greater Sri Lankan state sponsored colonization of Sinhalese in Tamil areas. The Mullaitivu District had historically been a Tamil area, and the population was almost entirely Tamil in the district. The villages situated at the southernmost part of the district, serving as the vital link between the North and the East became favorite targets for colonies of the Government. The fishing villages in the district including Kokkilai were colonized by Sinhala fishermen from Negombo and Chilaw. In December 1984, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam reprised these colonization attempts by attacking these newly established colonies in North-East which were heavily protected by Sri Lankan military and Sri Lankan Home Guards who had earlier ethnically cleansed the native Tamil population from these villages. Following the recapture of the North and East by Government forces, the land border between Mullaitivu District and Trincomalee District were once again colonized with Sinhalese settlers in what were traditionally Tamil lands. Sinhalese were settled in traditionally Tamil land, given land, money to build homes and security provided by the Special Task Force.The war - one year on As a result, the demographics of the region had been significantly altered and a new division called the Weli Oya Divisional Secretariat (a Sinhalese corruption of the Tamil term \\"\\"Manal Aru\\") was carved in the southern parts of the Mullaitivu district. Today the majority of the population in the area is Sinhalese while Tamils have been systematically denied any claim to their lands.Sensitive colonization in Manal Aru area in Mullaithivu district.

It is set in the 1840s in the town of St. Petersburg, where Twain lived as a boy. In the novel Tom Sawyer has several adventures, often with his friend Huckleberry Finn. Originally a commercial failure, the book ended up being the best selling of any of Twain's works during his lifetime. Though overshadowed by its sequel, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, the book is considered by many to be a masterpiece of American literature, and was one of the first novels to be written on a typewriter. ==Plot== Tom Sawyer, US commemorative stamp of 1972 showing the whitewashed fence. Tom and Becky lost in the caves. Illustration from the 1876 edition by artist True Williams. Tom Sawyer, an orphan, lives with his Aunt Polly and his half-brother Sid in the fictional town of St. Petersburg, Missouri sometime in the 1840s. A fun-loving boy, Tom skips school to go swimming and is made to whitewash his aunt's fence for the entirety of the next day, Saturday, as punishment. In one of the most famous scenes in American literature, Tom cleverly persuades the various neighbourhood children to trade him small trinkets and treasures for the \\"privilege\\" of doing his tedious work, using reverse psychology to convince them it is an enjoyable activity. Tom later trades the trinkets with other students for various denominations of tickets, obtained at the local Sunday school for memorizing verses of Scripture; he cashes in these in to the minister to win a coveted Bible offered to studious children as a prize, despite being one of the worst students in the Sunday school and knowing almost nothing of Scripture, eliciting envy from the students and a mixture of pride and shock from the adults. Tom falls in love with Becky Thatcher, a new girl in town and the daughter of a prominent judge. Tom wins the admiration of the judge in the church by obtaining the Bible as a prize but reveals his ignorance when he is unable to answer basic questions about Scripture. Tom pursues Becky, eventually persuading her to get engaged by kissing him. Their romance soon collapses when she discovers that Tom was engaged to another schoolgirl, Amy Lawrence, and that Becky was not his first girlfriend. Shortly after Becky shuns him, Tom accompanies Huckleberry Finn, a vagrant boy whom all the other boys admire, to a graveyard at midnight to perform a superstitious ritual designed to heal warts. At the graveyard, they witness a trio of body snatchers, Dr Robinson, Muff Potter and Injun Joe, robbing a grave. Muff Potter is drunk and eventually blacks out, while Injun Joe gets into a fight with Dr Robinson and murders him. Injun Joe then appears to frame Muff Potter for the murder. Tom and Huckleberry Finn swear a blood oath not to tell anyone about the murder, fearing Injun Joe would somehow discover it was them and murder them in turn. Muff Potter is eventually jailed, assuming he committed the killing in an act of drunkenness and accepting of his guilt and fate. Tom grows bored by school, and along with his friends Joe Harper and Huckleberry Finn, they run away to Jackson's Island in the Mississippi River to begin life as \\"pirates\\". While enjoying their freedom, they become aware that the community is scouring the river for their bodies, as the boys are missing and presumed dead. Tom sneaks back home one night to observe the commotion and after a brief moment of remorse at his loved ones' suffering, he is struck by the grand idea of appearing at his funeral. The trio later carries out this scheme, making a sensational and sudden appearance at church in the middle of their joint funeral service, winning the immense respect of their classmates for the stunt. Back in school, Tom regains Becky's favour after he nobly accepts the blame and caning for a book she has ripped. In court, Injun Joe pins the murder on Muff Potter, although Tom and Huckleberry Finn know he is innocent. At Potter's trial, Tom decides to defy his blood oath with Huck and speaks out against Injun Joe, who quickly escapes through a window before he can be apprehended. Henceforth, the boys live in constant fear of Joe's revenge for incriminating him. Summer arrives and Tom and Huck decide to hunt for buried treasure in a haunted house. After venturing upstairs, they hear a noise below and peering through holes in the floor, they see the deaf-mute Spaniard who had shown up in the village some weeks before revealing himself to be Injun Joe. Speaking freely, Injun Joe and a companion plan to bury some stolen treasure of their own in the house. From their hiding spot, Tom and Huck wriggle with delight at the prospect of digging it up. By chance, the villains discover an even greater gold hoard buried in the hearth and carry it off to a better hiding place. The boys are determined to find it and one night, Huck spots them and follows them; he overhears Injun Joe's plans to break into the house of the wealthy Widow Douglas and mutilate her face in revenge for her late husband, a justice of the peace, having once ordered him to be publicly whipped for vagrancy. Running to fetch help, Huck prevents the crime and requests his name not be made public, for fear of Injun Joe's retaliation, thus becoming an anonymous hero. Tom goes on a picnic to McDougal's Cave with Becky and their classmates. Tom and Becky get lost and end up wandering in the extensive cave complex for several days, facing starvation and dehydration. Becky becomes extremely dehydrated and weak and Tom's search for a way out grows more desperate. He encounters Injun Joe in the caves one day but is not seen by his nemesis. Eventually, Tom finds a way out and they are joyfully welcomed back by their community. Judge Thatcher, Becky's father, has McDougal's Cave sealed with an iron door. When Tom hears of the sealing two weeks later, he is horror-stricken, knowing that Injun Joe is still inside. He directs a posse to the cave, where they find Injun Joe's corpse just inside the sealed entrance, starved to death after having desperately consumed raw bats and candle stubs as a last resort. The place of his death and the in situ cups he used to collect water from a dripping stalactite, becomes a local tourist attraction. A week later, having deduced from Injun Joe's presence at McDougal's Cave that the villain must have hidden the stolen gold inside, Tom takes Huck to the cave and they find the box of gold, the proceeds of which are invested for them. The Widow Douglas adopts Huck but he finds the restrictions of a civilized home life painful, attempting to escape back to his vagrant life. Tom tricks him into thinking that he can later join Tom's new scheme of starting a robber band if he returns to the widow. Reluctantly, Huck agrees and goes back to the widow. == Significance == The novel has elements of humour, satire and social criticism; features that later made Mark Twain one of the most important authors of American literature. Mark Twain describes some autobiographical events in the book. The novel is set around Twain's actual boyhood home of Hannibal, near St. Louis, and many of the places in it are real and today support a tourist industry as a result. The concept of what boyhood is is developed through Tom's actions as well as his runaway adventure with Joe and Huckleberry. To help show how mischievous and messy boyhood was, The Miriam and Ira D. Wallach Division of Art, Prints and Photographs, shows a picture of a young boy smoking a pipe, sawing furniture, climbing all over the place, and sleeping. In Twain's novel, Tom and his friend are young when they decide they want to learn how to smoke a pipe. Tom and Joe do this to show just how cool they are to the other boys. == Inception == Tom Sawyer is Twain's first attempt to write a novel on his own. He had previously written contemporary autobiographical narratives (The Innocents Abroad or The New Pilgrims' Progress, Roughing It) and two short texts called sketches which parody the youth literature of the time. These are The Story of the Good Boy and The Story of the Wicked Little Boy which are satirical texts of a few pages. In the first, a model child is never rewarded and ends up dying before he can declaim his last words which he has carefully prepared. In the second story, an evil little boy steals and lies, like Tom Sawyer, but finishes rich and successful. Tom appears as a mixture of these little boys since he is at the same time a scamp and a boy endowed with a certain generosity. By the time he wrote Tom Sawyer, Twain was already a successful author based on the popularity of The Innocents Abroad. He owned a large house in Hartford, Connecticut but needed another success to support himself, with a wife and two daughters. He had collaborated on a novel with Charles Dudley Warner, The Gilded Age published in 1874. He had earlier written an unpublished memoir of his own life on the Mississippi and had corresponded with a boyhood friend, Will Bowen, both of which had evoked many memories and were used as source material. Twain named his fictional character after a San Francisco fireman whom he met in June 1863. The real Tom Sawyer was a local hero, famous for rescuing 90 passengers after a shipwreck. The two remained friendly during Twain's three-year stay in San Francisco, often drinking and gambling together. == Publication == Frontispiece and title page of the first American edition In November 1875 Twain gave the manuscript to Elisha Bliss of the American Publishing Company, who sent it to True Williams for the illustrations. A little later, Twain had the text also quickly published at Chatto and Windus of London, in June 1876, but without illustration. Pirate editions appeared very quickly in Canada and Germany. The American Publishing Company finally published its edition in December 1876, which was the first illustrated edition of Tom Sawyer. These two editions differ slightly. After completing his manuscript, Twain had a copy made of it. It is this copy which was read and annotated by his friend William Dean Howells. Howells and Twain corresponded through fairly informal, handwritten letters discussing many aspects of his works and manuscripts; language choices, character development, as well as racial development and depiction. Twain then made his own corrections based on Howells' comments which he later incorporated in the original manuscript, but some corrections escaped him. The English edition was based on this corrected copy, while the illustrated American edition was based on the original manuscript. To further complicate matters, Twain was personally concerned with the revision of the proofs of the American edition, which he did not do for the English edition. The American edition is therefore considered the authoritative edition. == Critical analysis == A third person narrator describes the experiences of the boys, interspersed with occasional social commentary. In its sequel, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, Mark Twain changes to a first person narrative which takes moral conflicts more personally and thus makes greater social criticism possible. The two other subsequent books, Tom Sawyer Abroad and Tom Sawyer, Detective, are similarly in the first person narrative from the perspective of Huckleberry Finn. The book has raised controversy for its use of the racial epithet \\"nigger\\"; a bowdlerized version aroused indignation among some literary critics. The book has been criticised for its caricature-like portrayal of Native Americans through the character Injun Joe. He is depicted as malevolent for the sake of malevolence, is not allowed to redeem himself in any way by Twain, dies a pitiful and despairing death in a cave and upon his death is treated as a tourist attraction. Revard suggests that the adults in the novel blame the character's Indian blood as the cause of his evil. ==Sequels and other works featuring Tom Sawyer== * Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1884) * Tom Sawyer Abroad (1894) * Tom Sawyer, Detective (1896) Tom Sawyer, the story's title character, also appears in two other uncompleted sequels: Huck and Tom Among the Indians and Tom Sawyer's Conspiracy.

The Centralian Advocate was first published on 24 May 1947.Centralian Advocate, 24 May 1947 The newspaper was founded by Charles Henry \\"Pop\\" Chapman who had made his fortune gold mining in the Tanami Desert. The first edition contained a mix of news and opinion from Alice Springs and around the world. Mention was made of a predecessor, The Dead Heart, which was described as a \\"news sheet\\" that published 30 editions in seven months.The Dead Heart passes, Centralian Advocate, 24 May 1947 Walter Allan was the inaugural editor. Allan Wauchope was editor and part-owner in January 1950 when the Centralian Advocate building on Railway Terrace was destroyed by fire, causing damage estimated at £15,000 and prompting the newspaper to criticise the lack of a fire brigade at that time in Alice Springs. War hero Jim Bowditch wrote for the newspaper from 1950–54 and later become editor of the NT News. Bowditch used the newspaper to campaign for the right of Aboriginal people with white heritage to receive full citizenship. Bowditch was active in community affairs through his interests in politics, theatre and cricket. Chapman sold the business in April 1949 to Wauchope, Ron Morcom and Mrs JH McArthur.Centralian Advocate, 22 April 1949 There were several other owners before News Corp bought the Centralian Advocate in 1966. ==Production and distribution== Centralian Advocate on the press, November 2014.

(; 1883–1943) was a Chinese writer, activist, newspaper editor, poet and school founder. She has been mentioned as one of the top four women in literature from the early Republic of China. ==Early life== Lü Bicheng was born in Taiyuan, Shanxi in 1883 during the late Qing dynasty, but is considered a native of her ancestral home of Jingde County, Anhui by Chinese convention. Her father Lü Fengqi (呂鳳岐), who earned a jinshi degree in 1877, served as Educational Commissioner of Shanxi Province. Her mother Yan Shiyu (嚴士瑜) was an educated gentry woman. Lü Bicheng was the third of four daughters in the family, and her elder sisters Lü Huiru and Lü Meisun were also known for their literary achievement. When she was four, her father retired to Lu'an, Anhui. She lived a life of comfort until the age of 12, when her father died in 1895. Because Lü Fengqi had no male heir, relatives of the Lü lineage contested for his inheritance, and Yan Shiyu and her four daughters were forced to move to Lai'an County to live with her natal family. When she was nine, Lü Bicheng was betrothed to a Wang family, but as her own family fortune declined, the Wang family broke off the marriage contract, giving the young Bicheng the stigma of a \\"rejected woman\\". The resulting emotional scar is often considered a major factor in her later decision to never marry. Her widowed mother and the Lü girls were not well treated at the Yan family in rural Anhui. When Lü was 15 or 16, Yan Shiyu sent her to live with her maternal uncle Yan Langxuan (嚴朗軒), who was the salt administrator in Tanggu, the port city outside the northern metropolis of Tianjin. Her sister Huiru also joined her later. ==Career== During her stay in Tanggu, Qing China went through the tumultuous period of the failed Hundred Days' Reform of 1898, which brought about increasing awareness of women's education, and the Boxer Rebellion of 1900. In 1904, Mrs. Fang, the wife of her uncle's secretary, invited Lü Bicheng to visit a girls' school in Tianjin, but her uncle prevented her from going and severely reprimanded her. The next day, she ran away from her uncle's home, and took the train to Tianjin with no money or luggage. She wrote a letter to Mrs. Fang, who was staying at the dormitory of the Ta Kung Pao newspaper. Ying Lianzhi, the Catholic Manchu nobleman who founded the newspaper, read the letter and was so impressed by it that he made her an assistant editor. At the time, it was sensational for a woman to write for an influential national newspaper such as Ta Kung Pao. She was 21 years old. Beiyang Women's Normal School in 1912 – the school that Lü started. Lü's ci poetry was published in the newspaper and it was very well received. She was the chief editor of the newspaper from 1904 to 1908. In 1904 she decided to improve education for girls. She had published her thoughts on women's rights and the general editor of the newspaper introduced her to Yan Fu who was an advocate for Western ideas. The Beiyang Women's Normal School was established that same year. At 23 Lü took on the job of principal of the school she had founded two years before. At first this school found it difficult to find girls who qualified for secondary education and students were brought in from Shanghai to make up the numbers. Alumni of this school included Deng Yingchao, Liu Qingyang and Xu Guangping. Lü knew the revolutionary Qiu Jin and they had similar objectives but Lü did not join her in Japan when she was invited as she was unsure whether women should meddle in politics. She was then chosen to be secretary to Yuan Shikai, one of the most powerful people in China. When he set out to declare himself emperor of China she left, like many of his followers, and abandoned him. In 1918 Lü travelled to New York where she attended Columbia University for four years. During this time she was a foreign correspondent for the Shanghai Times.Between 1918 and 1920, Lü Bicheng visited Mount Lu, she wrote a literary essay \\"Sojourn in Mount Lu: A Sundry Record\\". In 1930 Lü became a Buddhist and ceased to publish any more of her works. She later died in 1943 in Hong Kong.Lv Bicheng: Newspaper Woman, Educator and Buddhist, Frank Zhao, 13 January 2014, Women of China, retrieved 11 April 2014 ==Legacy== Lü Bicheng has been listed as one of the top four women \\"geniuses\\" of the early Republic of China, together with Eileen Chang, Xiao Hong, and Shi Pingmei; Lü's biography was published in 2012. ==ReferencesBibliography== * * * Fong, Grace S. “Alternative Modernities, or a Classical Woman of Modern China: The Challenging Trajectory of Lü Bicheng’s (1883-1943) Life And Song Lyrics.” NAN NÜ 6, no. 1 (April 1, 2004): 12–59. * * *Different Worlds of Discourse : Transformations of Gender and Genre in Late Qing and Early Republican China, edited by Nanxiu Qian, et al., BRILL, 2008.

All 53 seats in the City Council were up for election. The election was held simultaneously with regional elections in thirteen autonomous communities and local elections all throughout Spain, as well as the 1999 European Parliament election. The People's Party (PP) won an absolute majority of seats for a third consecutive time, but, for the first time since the 1987 election the party lost votes and seats. The Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) maintained its second place but reverted the decline it had been suffering since 1983. PSOE gains came at the expense of United Left (IU), which lost nearly half of its votes and seats. As a result, José María Álvarez del Manzano was elected as Mayor of Madrid for a third term in office. ==Electoral system== The City Council of Madrid () was the top-tier administrative and governing body of the municipality of Madrid, composed of the mayor, the government council and the elected plenary assembly. Elections to the local councils in Spain were fixed for the fourth Sunday of May every four years. Voting for the local assembly was on the basis of universal suffrage, which comprised all nationals over eighteen, registered in the municipality of Madrid and in full enjoyment of their political rights, as well as resident non-national European citizens and those whose country of origin allowed Spanish nationals to vote in their own elections by virtue of a treaty. Local councillors were elected using the D'Hondt method and a closed list proportional representation, with a threshold of five percent of valid votes—which included blank ballots—being applied in each local council. Parties not reaching the threshold were not taken into consideration for seat distribution. Councillors were allocated to municipal councils based on the following scale: {  left; font-size:95%;\\" - bgcolor=\\"#E9E9E9\\" align=\\"center\\" ! width=\\"120\\" Population ! width=\\"265\\" Councillors -  <250  5 -  251–1,000  7 -  1,001–2,000  9 -  2,001–5,000  11 -  5,001–10,000  13 -  10,001–20,000  17 -  20,001–50,000  21 -  50,001–100,000  25 -  >100,001  +1 per each 100,000 inhabitants or fraction +1 if total is an even number } The mayor was indirectly elected by the plenary assembly. A legal clause required that mayoral candidates earned the vote of an absolute majority of councillors, or else the candidate of the most-voted party in the assembly was to be automatically appointed to the post. In the event of a tie, a toss-up would determine the appointee. The electoral law allowed for parties and federations registered in the interior ministry, coalitions and groupings of electors to present lists of candidates. Parties and federations intending to form a coalition ahead of an election were required to inform the relevant Electoral Commission within ten days of the election call, whereas groupings of electors needed to secure the signature of a determined amount of the electors registered in the municipality for which they were seeking election, disallowing electors from signing for more than one list of candidates. For the case of Madrid, as its population was over 1,000,001, at least 8,000 signatures were required. ==Opinion polls== The table below lists voting intention estimates in reverse chronological order, showing the most recent first and using the dates when the survey fieldwork was done, as opposed to the date of publication. Where the fieldwork dates are unknown, the date of publication is given instead. The highest percentage figure in each polling survey is displayed with its background shaded in the leading party's colour. If a tie ensues, this is applied to the figures with the highest percentages. The \\"Lead\\" column on the right shows the percentage-point difference between the parties with the highest percentages in a given poll. When available, seat projections are also displayed below the voting estimates in a smaller font. 27 seats were required for an absolute majority in the City Council of Madrid (28 until 1 January 2003). { class=\\" collapsible collapsed\\" center; font-size:95%; line-height:16px;\\" - style=\\"height:42px; background- color:#E9E9E9\\" ! style=\\"width:250px;\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" Polling firm/Commissioner ! style=\\"width:125px;\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" Fieldwork date ! style=\\"width:50px;\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" Sample size ! style=\\"width:45px;\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" Turnout ! style=\\"width:35px;\\" PP ! style=\\"width:35px;\\" PSOE ! style=\\"width:35px;\\" IU ! style=\\"width:20px;\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" Lead - ! style=\\"background:;\\" ! style=\\"background:;\\" ! style=\\"background:;\\" -  colspan=\\"8\\" A0A0A0\\" - EFEFEF;\\"  1999 municipal election  13 Jun 1999   60.1   49.5  36.0  8.7  style=\\"background:; color:white;\\" 13.5 -  colspan=\\"8\\" A0A0A0\\" -  Sigma Dos/El Mundo  27 May–2 Jun 1999  500 ?

It was produced by Ron Propper. The Divine is the story of Mark, an explosives expert who, despite his better judgment, signs onto a freelance job with his old army friend, Jason. In Quanlom, a fictional Southeast Asian country, the pair are assisting the military when Mark is lured in by a group of child-soldiers, led by 9-year-old twins nicknamed \\"The Divine\\", who intent on forcing a showdown between ancient magic and modern technology. The Divine is very loosely inspired by the real story of twins Johnny and Luther Htoo, who jointly led the God's Army guerrilla group – a splinter group of Karen National Union – in Myanmar (Burma) during the late 1990s, and according to legends had magical powers. The Divine was released in French by Dargaud in January 2015 under the title Le Divin, and received critical praise. Frédéric Potet from Le Monde had labeled it \\"A combination of Bob Morane [a popular French adventure hero], David Lynch, and Katsuhiro Otomo (Akira)\\". Eric Libiot from L'express compared the coloring in the book (By Tomer Hanuka) to that of Hergé, creator of Tintin. Lysiane Ganousse from L'Est Républicain wrote: \\"The authors have turned a chilling true story into a stunning tale\\", and the popular comics critique website, 9emeArt, had given it a rating of 10 out 10, declaring that \\"Even though it's only January, we can already say it's going to be one of the best releases of the year\\". The Divine was published in the U.S. by First Second Books, featuring a blurb by author Yann Martel, best known for the international bestseller Life of Pi. It was released in July 2015 and has hit the New York Times Best Sellers list. It has since received highly positive reviews. Publishers Weekly had chosen The Divine for \\"top ten graphic novel for spring 2015\\", describing it later on as: \\"Heady, hellacious, and phantasmagoric\\". Jesse Karp on his Booklist review wrote: \\"Stunning artwork and creeping dread weave together in this satisfying and moving page- turner\\". Douglas Wolk from The New York Times described it as \\"a too rare example of artists getting top billing\\", referring to the artwork by Asaf and Tomer Hanuka. Joshua Rivera from GQ wrote: \\"The Divine's story is unflinching and raw, and its art is quite possibly the most beautiful of any comic this year\\". Michael Mechanic from Mother Jones called it \\"beautifully rendered\\", while io9 defined it as \\"Your next comics obsession\\". Rich Barrett from Mental Floss chose it for \\"The most interesting comics of the week\\" and praised it for being \\"stunning, cohesive combination [of elements]\\". Terry Hong, from The Smithsonian Asian Pacific American Center blog, wrote: \\"can’t-turn-away riveting [...] Unrelenting and uninterruptible\\", and the Eisner nominated comics blog Comics & Cola dubbed it \\"superb\\" and chose it for its pick of the month. The creators were featured in interviews on Entertainment Weekly, Juxtapoz, Paste, The A.V. Club and elsewhere. The Divine was chosen as one of the best graphic novels of 2015 by GQ, The A.V. Club, Barnes & Noble, Comics & Cola and others. It was published in Italy by BAO Publishing, and was scheduled to be published in Germany in 2016 by Cross Cult. In February 2016, The Divine has received the gold-medal of the 9th International Manga Award, in a ceremony in Tokyo, Japan. ==References *Boaz Lavie's official website * Boaz Lavie's bio on Macmillan's authors index *The Divine on Amazon.com *Le Divin on Amazon.fr *The Lake: Official Website *Shobo: Official Website Category:1974 births Category:Living people Category:Israeli male short story writers Category:Israeli short story writers Category:Israeli comics writers Category:Israeli film directors Category:Israeli video game designers ","title":"Boaz Lavie"},{"id":"46379726","text":"Jonathan Ruffer DL (born 17 August 1951) is a British City investor, art collector and philanthropist. ==Early life== Jonathan Ruffer was born on 17 August 1951 in London, England, and lived from an early age in Stokesley, North Yorkshire, England.Jonathan Garnier Ruffer , Debrett'sRuffer LLP pays member of firm £18m, Yorkshire Post, 28 December 2014Millionaire Jonathan Ruffer pledges to tackle deprivation, BBC, 25 January 2012 He was educated at Marlborough College, a public school in Marlborough, Wiltshire.

He was educated at Brixworth and trained as an attorney by John Reading, a barrister at Inner Temple. In 1635, Robert married Hannah Haunch (1617–1699) at All Hallows, London Wall, the daughter of Robert Haunch and his wife Susanna Heighes. The couple had 14 children, but many failed to survive to adulthood. Robert practised as a lawyer in Northampton, London and elsewhere, and served as Steward of Northampton from 1635 onwards. ==Writings== Robert is remarkable as a diarist. Only one manuscript of his writings appears to survive, but it provides insight into the experiences and world view of a devout Puritan who travelled between London and the Midlands during the years leading up to the English Civil War. Bound as a single volume running from 20 August 1637 to 16 August 1641, it is currently held by New College, Oxford (NCA 9502). It appears from annotations on its cover to be one of a series of diaries kept by the author. The diary contains 588 pages and some 89,000 words. The subject matter includes accounts of the author's family events and business activities, along with extensive comments and reflections of a spiritual nature. ==Later life== Robert died at Northampton on 15 November 1654 and was buried there at All Saints' Church two days later. He left no will, administration of his estate being granted in the following year to his widow Hannah.

The Bosnian American jeweler who discovered the postcard after 95 years, was visiting his native Sarajevo in June 2010 when he coincidentally met Bičakčić's grandson while looking around a local antique shop in downtown Sarajevo. Because the grandson had the same last surname as Edhem Bičakčić, the jeweler presented the postcard to the grandson, who immediately recognized his grandfather on the photograph. ==Politics== Bičakčić was elected as the 9th Mayor of Sarajevo in October 1928, taking over for Ibrahim Hadžiomerović. His term lasted one year. He was re-elected as mayor in 1935 and stayed on post until 1939. Bičakčić was the only mayor of Sarajevo to serve two nonconsecutive terms. ==See also== * Bičakčić ==References== Category:1884 births Category:1941 deaths Category:People from Sarajevo Category:Bosniaks of Bosnia and Herzegovina Category:Bosnia and Herzegovina Muslims Category:Mayors of Sarajevo Category:Disease-related deaths in Bosnia and Herzegovina Category:Bosnia and Herzegovina politicians ","title":"Edhem Bičakčić"},{"id":"46379849","text":"Holambi Khurd is a locality in Delhi City in Delhi State, India.

All 55 seats in the City Council were up for election. The election was held simultaneously with regional elections in thirteen autonomous communities and local elections all throughout Spain. The People's Party (PP) under President of the Community of Madrid Alberto Ruiz- Gallardón, who was succeeding the retiring José María Álvarez del Manzano, managed to revert the near-tie situation predicted by opinion polls between his party and the PSOE-IU bloc. Gallardón went on to win a comfortable absolute majority both in votes and seats, reverting the 1999 result in which it had seemed that party's support had begun to decline. The Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) under Trinidad Jiménez obtained its best result since it was ousted from power in 1989, despite it not being enough to recover the mayoralty. United Left (IU) continued on its long-term decline and lost another seat, scoring its worst result since 1987. A remarkable event for this election was that both main parties' contenders (Ruiz-Gallardón and Jiménez) were cousins, despite belonging to opposing parties. ==Electoral system== The City Council of Madrid () was the top-tier administrative and governing body of the municipality of Madrid, composed of the mayor, the government council and the elected plenary assembly. Elections to the local councils in Spain were fixed for the fourth Sunday of May every four years. Voting for the local assembly was on the basis of universal suffrage, which comprised all nationals over eighteen, registered in the municipality of Madrid and in full enjoyment of their political rights, as well as resident non-national European citizens and those whose country of origin allowed Spanish nationals to vote in their own elections by virtue of a treaty. Local councillors were elected using the D'Hondt method and a closed list proportional representation, with a threshold of five percent of valid votes—which included blank ballots—being applied in each local council. Parties not reaching the threshold were not taken into consideration for seat distribution. Councillors were allocated to municipal councils based on the following scale: {  style=\\"text- align:left; font-size:95%;\\" - bgcolor=\\"#E9E9E9\\" align=\\"center\\" ! width=\\"120\\" Population ! width=\\"265\\" Councillors -  <250  5 -  251–1,000  7 -  1,001–2,000  9 -  2,001–5,000  11 -  5,001–10,000  13 -  10,001–20,000  17 -  20,001–50,000  21 -  50,001–100,000  25 -  >100,001  +1 per each 100,000 inhabitants or fraction +1 if total is an even number } The mayor was indirectly elected by the plenary assembly. A legal clause required that mayoral candidates earned the vote of an absolute majority of councillors, or else the candidate of the most-voted party in the assembly was to be automatically appointed to the post. In the event of a tie, a toss-up would determine the appointee. The electoral law allowed for parties and federations registered in the interior ministry, coalitions and groupings of electors to present lists of candidates. Parties and federations intending to form a coalition ahead of an election were required to inform the relevant Electoral Commission within ten days of the election call, whereas groupings of electors needed to secure the signature of a determined amount of the electors registered in the municipality for which they were seeking election, disallowing electors from signing for more than one list of candidates. For the case of Madrid, as its population was over 1,000,001, at least 8,000 signatures were required. ==Opinion polls== The table below lists voting intention estimates in reverse chronological order, showing the most recent first and using the dates when the survey fieldwork was done, as opposed to the date of publication. Where the fieldwork dates are unknown, the date of publication is given instead. The highest percentage figure in each polling survey is displayed with its background shaded in the leading party's colour. If a tie ensues, this is applied to the figures with the highest percentages. The \\"Lead\\" column on the right shows the percentage-point difference between the parties with the highest percentages in a given poll. When available, seat projections are also displayed below the voting estimates in a smaller font. 28 seats were required for an absolute majority in the City Council of Madrid (27 until 1 January 2003). ; { class=\\" collapsible collapsed\\" center; font-size:95%; line-height:16px;\\" - style=\\"height:42px; background- color:#E9E9E9\\" ! style=\\"width:250px;\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" Polling firm/Commissioner ! style=\\"width:125px;\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" Fieldwork date ! style=\\"width:50px;\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" Sample size ! style=\\"width:45px;\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" Turnout ! style=\\"width:35px;\\" PP ! style=\\"width:35px;\\" PSOE ! style=\\"width:35px;\\" IUCM ! style=\\"width:35px;\\" LV ! style=\\"width:30px;\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" Lead - ! style=\\"background:;\\" ! style=\\"background:;\\" ! style=\\"background:;\\" ! style=\\"background:;\\" -  colspan=\\"9\\" A0A0A0\\" - EFEFEF;\\"  2003 municipal election  25 May 2003   68.9   51.3  36.7  7.2  1.6  style=\\"background:; color:white;\\" 14.6 -  colspan=\\"9\\" A0A0A0\\" - EAFFEA;\\"  Sigma Dos/Antena 3  25 May 2003 ?

It is endemic to the eastern slopes of Ecuadorian Andes in Napo and Pastaza provinces at elevations of asl. ==Taxonomy== Hyloxalus maculosus has been considered a synonym of Hyloxalus bocagei, but it is now treated as a valid species, though within the Hyloxalus bocagei species complex. In addition to morphological differences in both tadpoles and adults, male call parameters differ between Hyloxalus maculosus and Hyloxalus bocagei. ==Description== Males measure and females in snout–vent length. Dorsum is reddish-brown, more reddish posteriorly and in the hind limbs. There are brighter reddish-brown spots posterior to eyes and on arms at the arm-body junction. An oblique lateral stripe is present; it is complete but becoming diffused anteriorly or incomplete. Toe webbing is extensive. The male call is a long trill composed of paired pulsed notes. Tadpoles measure up to in total length, and newly metamorphosed juveniles about . ==Habitat and conservation== The range of Hyloxalus maculosus is within \\"Lowland Evergreen Forest\\" and \\"Foothill Evergreen Forest\\" vegetation zones. Males have been found calling on rocky streams at both sides of a road and inside water ducts that cross under the road. One male carrying nine tadpoles was found near a tiny pond, on a rocky stream surrounded by pasture. Tadpoles have been found in slow-running water in the ditch. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed Hyloxalus maculosus as \\"Data Deficient\\" in 2008, but Páez-Vacas and her colleagues suggested in 2010 that it should be considered as \\"Critically Endangered\\" because of its small range and habitat loss occurring in that range. ==References== maculosus Category:Amphibians of the Andes Category:Amphibians of Ecuador Category:Endemic fauna of Ecuador Category:Amphibians described in 1991 ","title":"Hyloxalus maculosus"},{"id":"46380070","text":"Andrus Utsar (born 20 March 1976 in Tallinn) is an Estonian weightlifter.

It showed promise but the sole prototype crashed fatally in a competition and no more were completed. ==Design and development== The C.74 was a large biplane, powered by four Hispano-Suiza 8Fb water-cooled, upright V-8 engines mounted in two pairs, each pair with one engine in tractor configuration and the other as a pusher. It was built from wood and steel and covered in plywood and fabric. An enclosed cabin could accommodate ten passengers. The C.74 had rectangular plan wings, with the upper plane slightly greater in span than the lower. It was a three bay biplane without stagger, with two sets of parallel, vertical interplane struts outboard and two sets of leaning parallel struts inboard on each wing. The latter met on the lower wing but diverged upwards in a narrow V, forming a cradle for an engine pair. Cabane struts joined the wing centre section to the upper fuselage longerons. The airliner had a flat sided fuselage with two open cockpits in tandem for the crew, one ahead of the wing leading edge and the other close behind but under the wing. The cabin had five flat side windows, arranged in a group of three in front of the cockpits and two behind, plus a curved window in the cylindrical nose. Aft of the last window was a port side cabin entry door. At the rear, the C.74's fin was triangular and broad, carrying a vertically edged balanced rudder that reached down to the keel. The tailplane was mounted on top of the fuselage and the elevators required a cut-out for rudder movement. Its landing gear was essentially of the tailskid type. On each side, vertical V-form legs from the lower fuselage longerons and from under the meeting points of the two engine support struts carried a single axle with a mainwheel at either end. In addition, a third axle, similarly mounted from the fuselage but forward of the wing, carried a pair of slightly smaller wheels intended to prevent nose-overs. On each lower wing a pair of backward trailing thin skids, attached below each of the two rear outboard interplane struts and lightly braced from the trailing edge extended well behind, giving protection against accidental ground contact. The C.74 was first flown in 1922 and seemed likely to sell well. Entered into Le Grand Prix des Avions des Transports (The Great Prize for Transport Aircraft) competition held in early November 1922, it was well regarded by the jury. On 14 November, as it took off from Le Bourget, bolts securing one of the propellers failed and the C.74 crashed killing all three crew members, the pilot Alphonse Poirée and mechanics Courcy and Bovillier. No more were built. ==SpecificationsReferences== C.077 Category:1920s French airliners Category:Four-engined push-pull aircraft Category:Biplanes ","title":"Caudron C.74"},{"id":"46380097","text":"Asteroceras stellare, the true star ammonite, is an extinct species of cephalopod belonging to the Ammonite subclass and to the family Arietitidae.Biolib These fast-moving nektonic carnivores lived during the lower Jurassic period, around 196.5 to 189.6 million years ago.The Paleobiology Database ==Description== Asteroceras stellare has a shell reaching a diameter of about . ==Distribution== Fossils of this species may be found in the Jurassic of Germany, Hungary and United Kingdom. ==References== Category:Arietitidae Category:Jurassic ammonites ","title":"Asteroceras stellare"},{"id":"46380109","text":"Thomas Vianney O'Donnell (23 July 1926 – 25 December 2014) was a New Zealand medical practitioner and academic. ==Early life and family== O'Donnell was born in Wellington in 1926, the only son of Scottish-born Annie (née Welsh) and Irish-born Patrick Joseph O'Donnell, a railway clerk. The O'Donnell family moved to Hunterville in 1938 when Patrick was appointed stationmaster there, and the following year Thomas was sent to board at Sacred Heart College, Auckland, situated in Ponsonby at that time. In 1943 he began medical studies at the University of Otago, graduating Bachelor of Medical Science in 1947 and MB ChB in 1950. While carrying out research in San Francisco in 1959 he met and married Mary Jean Lynch. The couple went on to have three daughters and one son. ==Medical and academic career== After working as a house surgeon and registrar at Dunedin Hospital between 1950 and 1953, O'Donnell was a medical research officer at the University of Otago from 1954 to 1955. Awarded a Nuffield Fellowship in medicine, he studied at the Postgraduate Medical School and Department of Respiratory Medicine at Hammersmith Hospital in London in 1956, and was a cardiology registrar there in 1957. In 1958 he was senior cardiology registrar at Middlesex Hospital and in 1959 he was a visiting cardiovascular research fellow at the University of California, San Francisco. He was awarded an MD from the University of Otago in 1959; his thesis was entitled Postural hypotension with special reference to the postural hypotension induced by hexamethonium bromide. In 1960 O'Donnell returned to Dunedin with his wife and took up a lectureship in the Department of Medicine at the University of Otago. He became an associate professor in 1966 and a professor in 1970. In 1973 he was appointed foundation chair of medicine and consultant physician at the Wellington School of Medicine, roles that he held until 1986. From 1986 to 1992 he was dean of the Wellington School of Medicine. On 27 August 1974, O'Donnell examined Norman Kirk, and found that the prime minister had an enlarged heart weakened by embolisms, a lung that was two-thirds incapacitated by the clot, and a very sore stomach as his liver was swollen with retained fluid. He persuaded Kirk to enter the Home of Compassion Hospital in Island Bay, Wellington the following day. Kirk died on 31 August, and O'Donnell signed his death certificate. O'Donnell's research interests were wide-ranging and included the health issues faced by workers in the aluminium industry, clinical trials of asthma treatments, fungal species found in the homes of asthma sufferers, and a survey of New Zealand asthma deaths. He served as president of the New Zealand Asthma Society and New Zealand president of the Thoracic Institute. He was also master of the Catholic Doctors' Guild, patron of Pregnancy Counselling Services and chair of the Wellington Catholic Homes Trust. Outside of medicine, he served on the Board of Censors. O'Donnell died at Kenepuru Hospital, Porirua, on 25 December 2014, and was buried at Mākara Cemetery. ==Honours== O'Donnell was made a Fellow of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians in 1963, and elected a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in 1972. In the 1989 Queen's Birthday Honours, he was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire, for services to medicine. ==References== Category:1926 births Category:2014 deaths Category:People from Wellington City Category:People educated at Sacred Heart College, Auckland Category:University of Otago alumni Category:University of Otago faculty Category:New Zealand pulmonologists Category:New Zealand people of Irish descent Category:Fellows of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians Category:Fellows of the Royal College of Physicians Category:New Zealand Commanders of the Order of the British Empire Category:Burials at Makara Cemetery ","title":"Tom O'Donnell (physician)"},{"id":"46380113","text":"Francis Luttrell may refer to: * Francis Luttrell (1628–1666), MP for Minehead 1660-66 * Francis Luttrell (1659–1690), MP for Minehead 1679-90 * Francis Fownes Luttrell (1756–1823), MP for Minehead 1780-83 == See also == * Feudal barony of Dunster ","title":"Francis Luttrell"},{"id":"46380115","text":"Pertev Naili Boratav, born Mustafa Pertev (September 2, 1907 – March 16, 1998) was a Turkish folklorist and researcher of folk literature.

He was educated at Istanbul High School before entering Istanbul University in 1927, graduating from the Turkish Language and Literature Department in 1930. In 1931-32 he worked as an assistant to the historian Mehmet Fuat Koprulu. After establishing Turkey's first Department of Folk Literature in 1946, Boratav was one of three professors who in 1947 were accused of promoting socialism and undermining nationalism. Though eventually acquitted in his 1948 trial, his department was closed and he was forced to move to Paris in 1952. He died in Paris in 1998. A student of Koprulu and Georges Dumézil, Boratav was also influenced by the writings of Arnold Van Gennep. He was pioneering in giving attention to performative aspects of folklore. The classification of Turkish folktales which he undertook with Wolfram Eberhard modified the comparative approach of Antti Aarne, by insisting that detailed classification of folktales of a particular culture needed to precede attempts at cross-cultural research. ==Works== * Köroğlu destanı [The Köroğlu epic], 1931 * Halk hikâyeleri ve halk hikâyeciliği [Folk Narratives and Folk Narration], 1946 * (with Wolfram Eberhard) Typen türkischer Volksmärchen [Types of the Turkish Folktale], 1953 * Les histoires d'ours en Anatolie [The Bear Stories of Anatolia], 1955 * Türkische Volksmärchen [Turkish Folk Tales], 1967 ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Birkalan, Hande, 'Pertev Naili Boratav, Turkish Politics, and the University Events', Turkish Studies Association Bulletin 25:1 (2001), pp.39-60 * Birkalan, Hande, 'Nachrichten: Pertev Naili Boratav (1907-1998), Fabula 45 (2004), pp.113-17 Category:1907 births Category:1998 deaths Category:Turkish folklorists Category:Turkish Marxists ","title":"Pertev Naili Boratav"},{"id":"46380134","text":"Herbert George McPhail ( 11 February 1878 – 20 September 1951) was a member of both the Queensland Legislative Council and Queensland Legislative Assembly. ==Early life== McPhail was born at Brisbane, Queensland, to Robert McPhail and his wife Fanny (née Challenger) and was educated at Brisbane Normal School. ==Political career== McPhail entered politics at the 1915 state election, winning the seat of Windsor for the Labor and defeating the sitting member, Hugh Macrossan.

Players control Qbby, a square-shaped character who can produce a string of connected boxes. The boxes are used to overcome obstacles in stages that Qbby must be guided through. The project plan for BoxBoy! was devised in 2011 by director Yasuhiro Mukae, although the game did not enter development until 2013. The core gameplay concept remained the same throughout the title's development, however, changes were made to length of levels and the structure of the game. Each set of stages was designed with a specific theme in mind with the intention of expanding the game's depth by introducing new elements continuously. The game was released via the Nintendo eShop distribution service in Japan in January 2015, and worldwide in April 2015. BoxBoy! received a positive reception from critics. Reviewers praised the game's creative puzzles and inventive use of the box-manipulation mechanics. Some critics were pleasantly surprised by the amount of content that was offered and agreed that the package was good value for money. However, the game's simple art style was divisive among reviewers. A sequel, BoxBoxBoy!, was released for the Nintendo 3DS in 2016, with a third game, Bye-Bye BoxBoy!, in 2017. A fourth installment, BoxBoy! + BoxGirl!, was released for the Nintendo Switch in April 2019. ==Gameplay== Qbby uses boxes to shield himself from the lasers. He can then detach and drop the boxes on the switch to open the door ahead. BoxBoy! is a puzzle platform video game in which players control a square-shaped character named Qbby. The goal of the game is to guide Qbby through a series of obstacle-filled stages that are divided into sets called worlds. Each world is focussed on a particular gameplay theme; for example one world introduces stages that contain deadly lasers, and another introduces cranes for transporting Qbby around. The central gameplay mechanic is Qbby's ability to create boxes and make use of them to clear the obstacles. Boxes are created one at a time as a connected string and the maximum number of boxes in a string varies between each stage. Qbby can detach the string of boxes then push it to different positions. The boxes can be used to overcome obstacles, such as creating a bridge to pass bottomless pits or building staircases to reach higher platforms. Additionally, Qbby can keep the string of boxes attached to his body. He may then use the boxes as a shield to block hazards such as deadly lasers. He is also able to grapple onto ledges and pull himself up by retracting through the boxes. Creating a new string of boxes causes the previous string to disappear. If Qbby dies, he will respawn at a nearby checkpoint. Completing stages rewards the player with medals that can be spent on challenge stages, music, and costumes for Qbby. Additional medals can be earned by collecting crowns found on each stage, which must be collected before a certain number of boxes are used. The game makes use of the Nintendo 3DS' Play Coin feature; Play Coins can be used to request hints to the puzzle solutions. BoxBoy! features a black and white monochrome graphical style. The game features a minimal story, in which Qbby meets two additional characters, Qucy and Qudy, after progressing through certain worlds. ==Development and release== BoxBoy! was developed by Japanese video game company HAL Laboratory. It was a small experimental project in development while the studio was working on Kirby: Triple Deluxe and Kirby and the Rainbow Curse. The project plan for BoxBoy! was conceived in July 2011 by employee Yasuhiro Mukae, who would later serve as the game's director. Prior to BoxBoy!, Mukae had never designed or directed a game, but his interest in undertaking these roles prompted him to start planning a project. His lack of experience and the difficulty of designing a game with a large scope led him to plan a game that was simple and compact. The concept of BoxBoy! arose when he was brainstorming ideas for a game that featured retro gameplay, in the style of titles released on the Nintendo Entertainment System and the Game Boy. The idea was simply creating and using boxes to traverse puzzle levels. Several members of staff saw potential in the concept and created a prototype for demonstration. Mukae's product proposal wasn't formally submitted to HAL until 2013, when the company announced that it would field game design concepts featuring new characters. The development team spent about six months experimenting with the game's design. Once development of Kirby: Triple Deluxe concluded, some members of its development team joined the BoxBoy! development team and the project entered full production. The game was complete after a year in full production. To give each world a theme, they were each designed with a particular gameplay element in mind. This approach created a structure where players would be introduced to new gameplay mechanics frequently. The intention was to keep the game engaging and continually expand the depth of gameplay as players progressed through the game. The first stage of each world is designed to be a simple puzzle that teaches players the new mechanic. Initially, the development team were creating large stages that would take a fairly long time to complete. However, they later decided that players should be able to complete them quicker, and thus the level structure was changed and the amount of content per stage was reduced. Story elements were also added to encourage players to keep playing. Creating an intuitive and easy control scheme was an important factor as the development team wanted to ensure that the action of creating boxes was comfortable and fun. The development team had considered implementing a multiplayer mode for BoxBoy!. Ultimately, the feature was excluded as they believed that making a fun single-player experience should be the priority. However, multiplayer would later be added in the series' fourth installment, Boxboy! + Boxgirl!. The use of black and white line art for the game's graphics was an attempt to differentiate it from other games and catch the interest of gamers. Implementing it presented some challenges for the design staff. The design of Qbby, the player character, came after the idea of creating boxes was established; he was designed from a functional perspective. At one point in development, while brainstorming BoxBoy!s visual style, the team had considered making Kirby the main character. It became difficult trying to make Kirby, a round character, look natural in the box-producing action, so they settled with a character that had a square-shaped body, the same as the boxes. Feet were added to Qbby so he could move and jump, and eyes were added so the player could recognise which direction he was facing. Since Qbby had a simple design, the team focussed on making his animations expressive to ensure the character was engaging and had a personality. BoxBoy! was published by Nintendo. The game was released for the Nintendo 3DS handheld console via the eShop distribution service in Japan on January 14, 2015, and worldwide on April 2, 2015. ==Reception== BoxBoy! received generally favourable reviews from critics according to review aggregator website Metacritic. Some reviewers highlighted that the early stages in BoxBoy! felt too basic, and consequently, the game did not make a great first impression. GameSpot writer Justin Haywald described the simplicity of the game's initial puzzles as \\"almost off-putting\\". However, he was satisfied with the more elaborate stages presented after progressing through the game, calling the puzzles \\"ingenious\\" and praising the intelligent use of the box-manipulation mechanic. IGN's Jose Otero complimented the game's level design and challenge posed by later stages in the game. He also liked the game's generous checkpoint system noting that it was helpful during the more difficult puzzles. Bob Mackey of USgamer mentioned that the friendly approach, short levels, and frequent checkpoints did not detract from the game's challenge; he said that by allowing players to quickly test different solutions without having to restart a stage, HAL had managed to remove the frustration typically found in similar block-based puzzle games. Christian Donlan of Eurogamer was surprised by the long length of the game and the amount of variety it offered given its simple premise. He enjoyed the game's pacing and felt that separating puzzles into short levels kept the game fun. Game Informer reviewer Kyle Hilliard also approved of the game's pacing. He remarked that BoxBoy!s low price and well-designed puzzles made it entirely worth playing. VentureBeat writer Gavin Greene agreed that the game offered a lot of content at an inexpensive price. The game's structure did draw some criticism from Jon Wahlgren, writing for Nintendo Life. He thought the game spent too much time teaching new mechanics and did not give players enough freedom to explore or experiment; as a result, he believed the game felt restricted. According to some writers, BoxBoy!s graphics and art resembled the style found in Game Boy titles; the reaction towards it was mixed among reviewers. While some critics described the graphics as \\"charming\\" and \\"stylish\\", others called it \\"sterile\\". The expressive animations and cute character designs were well received. ==Sequels== In 2016, a sequel titled BoxBoxBoy! was released for the Nintendo 3DS, allowing Qbby to create two sets of boxes at a time. The game was announced and released in Japan on January 6, 2016, and in other territories on June 30, 2016. A third game, titled Bye-Bye BoxBoy!, was released in 2017. The game adds new kinds of boxes, such as explosive bombs and rocket propelled boxes, as well as box children that need to be escorted safely through levels. A physical compilation of all three games, titled , was also released in Japan the same day. The compilation also included a soundtrack CD featuring the music from all three games, as well as a Qbby Amiibo figure, the latter of which can be used with Bye-Bye BoxBoy!. In a February 2019 Nintendo Direct, a fourth game was announced for the Nintendo Switch as BoxBoy! + BoxGirl!. ==NotesReferences * Category:2015 video games Category:HAL Laboratory games Category:Nintendo 3DS games Category:Nintendo 3DS-only games Category:Nintendo 3DS eShop games Category:Nintendo games Category:Nintendo franchises Category:Platform games Category:Puzzle video games Category:Puzzle-platform games Category:Video games developed in Japan ","title":"BoxBoy!"},{"id":"46380442","text":"This is a list of German television-related events in 1956. ==Events== *24 May - Germany enters the Eurovision Song Contest for the first time with \\"Im Wartesaal zum großen Glück\\", performed by Walter Andreas Schwarz and \\"So geht das jede Nacht\\", performed by Freddy Quinn. ==DebutsTelevision shows== 1950s *Tagesschau (1952–present) ==Ending this yearBirths== *23 February **Sabine Sauer, TV host & journalist **Reinhold Beckmann, TV host, football commentator & singer *24 July - Carmen Nebel, TV host ==Deaths== Category:Mass media in Germany stubs ","title":"1956 in German television"},{"id":"46380447","text":"A te may refer to: *A te, 2013 album by Fiorella Mannoia *\\"A Te\\", 1961 song by Anna Maria (singer) *\\"A Te\\", 1972 song by Iva Zanicchi *\\"A te\\", 2008 Jovanotti song *\\"A Te\\", 1968 song by Jimmy Fontana *\\"A Te\\", 1979s ong by Roberto Vecchioni ","title":"A te (disambiguation)"},{"id":"46380470","text":"Mike Gutmann (born 28 April 1962) is a Swiss former professional racing cyclist.

Sawyer also appears in at least three unfinished Twain works, Huck and Tom Among the Indians, Schoolhouse Hill and Tom Sawyer's Conspiracy. While all three uncompleted works were posthumously published, only Tom Sawyer's Conspiracy has a complete plot, as Twain abandoned the other two works after finishing only a few chapters. ==Inspiration== The fictional character's name may have been derived from a jolly and flamboyant chief named Tom Sawyer with whom Twain was acquainted in San Francisco, California, while Twain was employed as a reporter at the San Francisco Call. Twain used to listen to Sawyer tell stories of his youth, \\"Sam, he would listen to these pranks of mine with great interest and he'd occasionally take 'em down in his notebook. One day he says to me: ‘I am going to put you between the covers of a book some of these days, Tom.’ ‘Go ahead, Sam,’ I said, ‘but don’t disgrace my name.’\\" Twain himself said the character sprang from three people, later identified as: John B. Briggs (who died in 1907), William Bowen (who died in 1893) and Twain; however Twain later changed his story saying Sawyer was fully formed solely from his imagination, but as Robert Graysmith says, \\"The great appropriator liked to pretend his characters sprang fully grown from his fertile mind.\\" ==Portrayals== Actors who have portrayed Tom Sawyer in films and TV: *Jack Pickford (1917) *Gordon Griffith (1920) *Jackie Coogan (1930 and 1931) *Tommy Kelly (1938) *Billy Cook (1938) *Michael Miller (1944) *Robert Hyatt (1955, TV) *John Sharpe (1956, TV musical) *Kevin Schultz (1968 in the TV series The New Adventures of Huckleberry Finn) *Johnny Whitaker (1973) *Don Most (1975) *Sam Snyders (1979) *Chris Ritchie (1985 in the film The Adventures of Mark Twain) *Eugene Oakes (1986) *Raphael Sbarge (1990 in Back to Hannibal: The Return of Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn) *Jonathan Taylor Thomas (1995 in Tom and Huck) *Rhett Akins (2000, voice) *Grey Griffin (2003 in The Fairly Oddparents, voice) *Shane West (2003 in The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen) *Louis Hofmann (2011, German version of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer) *Leon Seidel (2012, German version of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn) *Joel Courtney (2014) *Adam Nee (2015) *Jeremy Shada (2015 in the 3DS game Code Name: S.T.E.A.M.) *Reilly Jacob (2016 in the TV series Once Upon a Time) ==References *The Adventures of Tom Sawyer by Mark Twain at Project Gutenberg *The Adventures of Tom Sawyer by Mark Twain at Archive.org Category:Mark Twain characters Category:Adventure film characters Category:Child characters in film Category:Child characters in literature Category:Child characters in musical theatre Category:Fictional characters from Missouri Category:Literary characters introduced in 1876 Category:Male characters in literature Category:Orphan characters in literature ","title":"Tom Sawyer"},{"id":"46380594","text":"Melaleuca nanophylla, commonly known as dwarf-leaved honey-myrtle is a rare plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae and is endemic to two small areas, one in Western Australia and the other in South Australia.

Its loosely bound spiral arms categorize it as Hubble-type Sbc. It is 60million light years away, and part of the Sculptor constellation. The VLT image of the galaxy (shown right) reveals the following. A prominent feature of NGC134 is its warped disc, i.e., when viewed sideways it does not appear flat. A trail of gas is stripped from the top edge of the disc. Together, these features suggest that it interacted with another galaxy, but that remains unproven. The galaxy has an abundance of ionized hydrogen regions along its spiral arms where stars are forming. These regions appear red in the picture. It also has many dark lanes of dust that occlude its complete starlight. The discovery of NGC134 is often attributed to Sir John Herschel at the Cape of Good Hope, but he did note that it might have been the 590th object discovered by James Dunlop in his 1828 publication, six years prior to Herschel's own observations. O'Meara has suggested NGC 134 might be named as the Giant Squid Galaxy. Supernova 2009gj in NGC134 was discovered in 2009 by the amateur astronomer Stuart Parker in New Zealand. ==References * Category:Spiral galaxies Category:Barred spiral galaxies Category:Interacting galaxies 0134 001851 Category:Sculptor (constellation) ","title":"NGC 134"},{"id":"46380629","text":"Josef Wehrli (born 3 December 1954) is a Swiss former professional racing cyclist.

It was built about 1820, as a two-story, frame dwelling. It was remodeled in the 1850s to add its distinctive two-tier flat roofed front porch. The porch features a five bay ornamental cast iron arcade in a grapevine pattern. The roof was modified to the hipped roof form and exterior chimneys rebuilt in 1911. The interior has Federal, Greek Revival, and Late Victorian-style design elements. The building housed the Salisbury Academy girls' school from about 1820 to 1825. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. It is located in the Salisbury Historic District. ==History== The house was built in 1820 for the Salisbury Female Academy. Five years later, Maxwell Chambers and his half-sister Rebecca Troy lived there. Later, Chambers moved and Sheriff Chaffin of Davie County, North Carolina bought it and rented it. Rowan County native Dr. Josephus Hall, who returned to Salisbury in 1853, bought the house along with his wife Mary Cowan in 1859 for $3,500. The purchase included stables and slaves' quarters. Hall added $125 worth of decorative ironwork. During the Civil War, Hall served as a surgeon for the Confederate Prison. When Union troops invaded, they took over the front part of the house, paying rent, and Hall and his family lived in the back. Hall died in 1873. When his wife died in 1902, she left all her property to daughter Henrietta, who was married to Julius D. McNeely. Their daughter Henrietta (McNeely) Strachan had married Waverly B. Strachan in 1901, and had a daughter Mildred Strachan. A 1938 photo by Frances Benjamin Johnston calls the house the McNeely House; information about the photo also refers to a Mrs. W. B. Strachan as being associated with the house at that time. The 1971 NRHP nomination says \\"Descendants of the Halls (among whom were the McNeelys and the Strachans from whom comes the present name of the house) have lived there for over a hundred years.\\" Hall's descendants continued to live in the house until 1972, at which time the Historic Salisbury Foundation bought it along with some original furnishings. In September 2019, Hall family members donated three other items of furniture that had once been in the house. ==References== Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in North Carolina Category:Federal architecture in North Carolina Category:Greek Revival houses in North Carolina Category:Victorian architecture in North Carolina Category:Houses completed in 1820 Category:Houses in Salisbury, North Carolina Category:National Register of Historic Places in Rowan County, North Carolina Category:Individually listed contributing properties to historic districts on the National Register in North Carolina Category:Historic district contributing properties in North Carolina ","title":"Josephus Hall House"},{"id":"46380647","text":"This is a list of German television related events from 1983. ==Events== *20 March - Hoffmann & Hoffmann are selected to represent Germany at the 1983 Eurovision Song Contest with their song \\"Rücksicht\\".

The Warburg Haus helped to shape the thought and work of some of the greatest scholars of the first half of the twentieth century, from Fritz Saxl and Erwin Panofsky to Ernst Cassirer. In 1933, the house was closed and its library shipped to London in order to escape the clutches of the Nazis. The original library is now part of the Warburg Institute in London. In 1993, the house was acquired by the city of Hamburg and renovated.

It was subsequently reclassified by Kurt Polycarp Joachim Sprengel as Merisma gracile in 1826, by William Nylander as Ramalina gracilis in 1860, by Petter Adolf Karsten as Clavariella gracilis in 1881. It was then described as Ramaria gracilis in Lucien Quélet's 1888 Flore mycologique de la France et des pays limitrophes, and this name was sanctioned by Elias Magnus Fries. The subsequently described Clavaria fragrantissima (G.F. Atk., 1908) is now considered a synonym. Within Ramaria, R. gracilis is a part of the subgenus Lentoramaria. ==Description== Ramaria gracilis fruit bodies (basidiocarps), which are made up of a dense cluster of branches, measure up to in height and in width. The individual branches, which have fairly thin bases, are typically forked and sometimes entangled with one another. In colour, the basidiocarps vary from a pale brown to white to pink-beige. The smell of anise can be used to distinguish the species from the otherwise similar Ramariopsis kunzei and Clavulina cristata. R. gracilis produces spores which measure from 5 to 7 by 3 to 4.5 micrometres (µm). The spores are elliptic with small warts which can be thin enough to look like spines. They vary in colour from yellow to brown. The cylindrical to club-shaped basidia measure from 25 to 45 by 5 to 7 µm. The hyphae are from 2 to 10 µm thick. ==Distribution and habitat== Ramaria gracilis is found in European coniferous woodland, where it grows on leaf litter. It has an uneven distribution, and is very rare. Basidiocarps are most often encountered between August and December. R. gracilis has been reported in Australia, but a 2014 study suggests that such reports were likely misidentifications of R. filicicola. ==ReferencesCategory:Fungi of Europe Category:Gomphaceae Category:Fungi described in 1797 ","title":"Ramaria gracilis"},{"id":"46380713","text":"The Osaka Chinese School is a Chinese international school in Naniwa-ku, Osaka, Japan.Home page.

ADT tachyphylaxis specifically refers to a sudden decrease in response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which are the most commonly prescribed antidepressants. ==Characteristics== Patients affected by ADT tachyphylaxis experience a noticeably sudden progressive decrease in response to SSRIs. The reported rates of this condition vary from 9% to 33% of SSRI users, and the majority of those affected are less responsive to subsequent treatments. In most observational studies, these individuals suffer a recurrence or relapse of depression without changing the previously effective dose. ADT tachyphylaxis incorporates drug sensitivity as a potential causal factor for the decreased response. However, tolerance provides a more accurate explanation. While the exact cause of ADT tachyphylaxis in individual cases is unknown, drug tolerance is a more comprehensive model, as it includes mechanisms of pharmacodynamic tolerance, metabolic tolerance, and others. Common examples ADT tachyphylaxis specifically occurs in depressed patients using SSRIs and MAOIs. Currently, SSRIs are the preferred treatment for depression among clinicians, as MAOIs, despite being very effective, require a few dietary restrictions and some caution when taking with other medications due to the potential for interactions capable of inducing dangerous side effects. ==Treatment== Following a declination or total extinction in response to a previously therapeutic dose of an antidepressant, the issue is clinically addressed as stemming from tolerance development. Several strategies are available, such as exploring drug options from a different drug class used to treat depression. The patient can also choose to switch to another SSRI (or MAOI, if applicable) while maintaining proportionate dose. If tolerance develops in a drug from the same class, the clinician may recommend a regular cycle consisting of all effective treatments within the SSRI or MAOI classes, in order to minimize transitional side effects while maximizing therapeutic efficacy. Other options include increasing dose of the same medication, or supplementation with another antidepressant. Dual reuptake inhibitors, such as serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors and some tricyclic antidepressants, have been preliminarily found to have lower rates of tachyphylaxis. ==References== Category:Pharmacodynamics ","title":"Antidepressant treatment tachyphylaxis"},{"id":"46380773","text":"Euaspidoceras babeanum is an extinct ammonoid-cephalopod species that lived during the Jurassic period.

Morris had multiple top-10 finishes in The Open Championship, including a third-place finish in the 1878 event held at Prestwick Golf Club in Prestwick, South Ayrshire, Scotland. He was the son of Tom Morris, Sr., also known as Old Tom Morris, and was named after James Ogilvie Fairlie, a mentor and patron of his father. He died in 1906 aged 50 of heart failure, unmarried. ==Early life== Morris was born on 8 January 1856 in Prestwick, Scotland. At age 22 he was entered to play in the 1878 Open Championship. At such a young age he was already an experienced tournament player having entered at least two prior Open Championship tournaments. In 1873 and 1874 he had finished tied for 11th and 10th place, respectively. He was the son of Tom Morris, Sr. and most assuredly learned the finer points of the game from his father. ==1878 Open Championship== Details of play In overcast weather with some rain, Morris took the early lead with a first round of 50. Jamie Anderson, Bob Kirk, and the English amateur John Ball, each scored 53 to be three shots behind. Morris began the second round badly and finished with a 56 for a total of 106. Anderson, with a second round of 53, was tied with him, while Bob Kirk and Tom Morris, Sr. were both two strokes behind. James Morris was in the third group out and had a final round 55 for a total of 161. Playing a few groups behind, Anderson began his third round with two sevens, but thereafter played steadily. With Morris finished, Anderson was told that he needed to play the last four holes in 17 to tie with Morris. At the Burn Hole (the 9th) Anderson holed—in spectacular fashion—a full iron shot for a three, followed that magnificent shot with a four at the 10th, and at the Short Hole (the 11th) his tee shot landed on top of the hill behind the green. The ball then ran down the hill and into the hole for a hole-in-one. A five at the last gave him a round of 51 and a total of 157. Bob Kirk, playing in the last group, was still in contention however his putt to tie Anderson lipped out and he missed the return putt.

P. macrostomus was described in 2006 by Douglass Fielding Hoese and Sally Reader; the type specimen was collected in Glenreagh, New South Wales. Its species name derived from the Ancient Greek makro \\"large\\" and stoma \\"mouth\\". Genetic analysis of the species from the different river drainages across its range showed that populations from the Lang Lang River in Victoria had diverged much earlier and most likely represent a separate, as yet undescribed species. ==Description== Predominantly dark brown, the dwarf flathead gudgeon has paler brown or orange belly and reaches in length, though more regularly is around . It has dark brown lips. It can be distinguished from the flathead gudgeon, which is larger, has a wider gill opening, and has vertical stripes on the sides of the belly. ==Distribution and habitat== The dwarf flathead gudgeon is found in estuaries and freshwater rivers from Baffle Creek in central Queensland through New South Wales and eastern Victoria to Wilsons Promontory. Inland the range extends westward along the Murray River into South Australia. In the southern parts of its range, it is more restricted to estuarine habitats, and is found further upstream in more northerly river drainages. The dwarf flathead gudgeon is commonly found alongside its larger relative, and often near some form of cover such as submerged vegetation or rocks. ==Feeding== Carnivorous, the dwarf flathead gudgeon eats insects and minute crustaceans. ==Breeding== The male guards the eggs after they are laid. The dwarf flathead gudgeon is mature by one year of age, though its longevity is unknown. ==References== Category:Eleotridae Category:Fish described in 2006 ","title":"Philypnodon macrostomus"},{"id":"46380825","text":"The Chugai' Pictograph Site is a prehistoric rock art site on the island of Rota in the Northern Mariana Islands.

Alternate names include big-headed gudgeon, bull head, bull-headed gudgeon, collundera, and Yarra gudgeon. ==Description== The flathead gudgeon generally grows to about 8 cm (3.2 in) in length, though large individuals up to 11 or 12 cm (4.5 in) have been recorded. It has a large, flattened head and large mouth, which extends back past the eyes, and two short dorsal fins. The upperparts can be various shades of grey, brown, black, or yellowish, with yellowish underparts. The flathead gudgeon can be distinguished from the dwarf flathead gudgeon (Philypnodon macrostomus) by barred lines on its flanks, larger size (the latter species only reaching 5 cm (2 in) long), and wide gill openings. ==Distribution and habitat== The flathead gudgeon is found in estuaries and freshwater rivers from just north of the Fitzroy River in central Queensland through New South Wales and Victoria to the Gawler River in South Australia, as well as some parts of northern Tasmania. ==Feeding== Carnivorous, the flathead gudgeon preys upon small fish, tadpoles, and aquatic arthropods. It, in turn, has been recorded as prey of the yellow-billed spoonbill. ==Breeding== The female lays 500–1000 elongated eggs on a hard surface in spring, which are watched over afterwards by the male. ==References== Category:Eleotridae Category:Taxa named by Gerard Krefft ","title":"Philypnodon grandiceps"},{"id":"46380873","text":"Yaraslav Iharavich Shyla (; Шило Ярослав Игоревич (05.03.1993); born 5 March 1993 in Minsk) is a Belarusian tennis player.

Cragg also criticised the song itself saying that the song \\"strong enough to make its mark in today's overcrowded pop market\\" and concluded that it was \\"also hard to shake the fact that it sounded better when Adele did it as \\"Rolling in the Deep\\" (2010) a few years ago. ==Track listings == Digital single # \\"Fire Under My Feet\\" – 3:34 Digital Remix SingleDigital Remix Single: *Download – *Streaming – #\\"Fire Under My Feet\\" (Dzeko & Torres Remix) – 4:07 Digital album track Release of I Am in the United Kingdom: * * * Digital Remixes EPDigital Remixes EP releases: *Download – *Streaming – #\\"Fire Under My Feet\\" (Benny Benassi Remix) – 5:17 #\\"Fire Under My Feet\\" (Endor Remix) – 3:33 #\\"Fire Under My Feet\\" (Steve Pitron & Max Sanna Remix) – 3:43 ==Personnel== Credits sourced from album booklet and liner. *Leona Lewis – vocals, composer *Toby Gad – instruments, programming, mixing, composer ==Charts== Weekly charts {class=\\" plainrowheaders sortable\\" center;\\" - !

Retrieved 11 Apr 2015. () is a special form of the Arma Christi cross, which occurs mainly in the Black Forest, but also occasionally in other regions of South Germany. In addition to the instruments of the Passion, Longinus crosses depict the figure of Saint Longinus as a horseman to the side of the crucified Jesus. These crosses are usually made of wood and are about 3–4 metres high. Often they are topped by a hipped roof that resembles the roofs of Black Forest houses, and a back wall on which the figures bearing the instruments are depicted. The history of Longinus crosses is closely bound up with the monastic orders that provided spiritual care in the Black Forest: the Jesuits, Capuchins and Cistercians. The popular missionaries of these religious communities erected mission crosses, on which the instruments associated with the suffering of Christ were displayed. The links between the Anterior Austrian parts of the Black Forest and the imperial capital of Vienna, where the Holy Lance was kept, could have played a role here. The design of these mission crosses was subsequently copied by private wayside and household crosses. The feature of the Longinus crosses, the depiction of the figure of Saint Longinus as a rider beneath the cross, is probably explained by the popularity of the saint as a patron of farmers. On older crosses, his figure is usually shown in the uniform of a Baden dragoon,Althaus (2003), p. 1. often accompanied by the verse \\"Truly, this was the Son of God\\" (from Mark 15:39) on his shield. Many Black Foresters served as cavalry in the wars of the 19th century, due to their familiarity with horses and, on their return from war, made Longinus crosses in memory of their own military service. Little is generally known about the woodcarvers who made the crosses. Stylistically, however, several individual artists can be distinguished and, in some cases, even their names are known. Of great artistic quality are crosses by the so- called \\"Herrgott Mattheubis\\", who came from the area of Schonach. Often the figures of Christ were ordered from professional sculptors, whilst the instruments were carved by members of the rural population themselves. Even today Longinus crosses are occasionally made. The older crosses are protected as Kleindenkmale (\\"little monuments\\"). == References  Literature == * Friedbert Andernach und Martin Ruch: Arma Christi- und Longinuskreuze im Erzbistum Freiburg.

After that NASA launched another Mars rover but with advanced technologies on July 30th of 2020 and it has same mission of learning the landscapes of Mars after its landed and make it possible for humans to travel to mars. == Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate == The Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate is one of four mission directorates within NASA, the other three are known as Human Exploration and Operation Directorate, The science Directorate, and the Space Technology Directorate. Their responsibility is to conduct research for NASA aeronautical. Every US Commercial aircraft and U.S. Air traffic controls have technologies made by NASA and tries to improve efficiency and maintain safety from researches. This researches help straight to today's air transportation system, aviation industry and the passengers and businesses who rely on aviation every single day. ARMD scientists, engineers, programmers, test pilots, facilities managers and strategic planners are doing everyday their best to help aviation in future. They are trying to design, create and testing advanced technologies that will make aviation much more friendly for environment and maintain safety and change the way we fly. ==Medicine in space== A variety of large-scale medical studies are being conducted in space by the National Space Biomedical Research Institute (NSBRI). Prominent among these is the Advanced Diagnostic Ultrasound in Microgravity Study, in which astronauts (including former ISS Commanders Leroy Chiao and Gennady Padalka) perform ultrasound scans under the guidance of remote experts to diagnose and potentially treat hundreds of medical conditions in space. Usually there is no physician on board the International Space Station, and diagnosis of medical conditions is challenging. Astronauts are susceptible to a variety of health risks including decompression sickness, barotrauma, immunodeficiencies, loss of bone and muscle, orthostatic intolerance due to volume loss, sleep disturbances, and radiation injury. Ultrasound offers a unique opportunity to monitor these conditions in space. This study's techniques are now being applied to cover professional and Olympic sports injuries as well as ultrasound performed by non-expert operators in populations such as medical and high school students. It is anticipated that remote guided ultrasound will have application on Earth in emergency and rural care situations, where access to a trained physician is often rare. ==Salt evaporation and energy management== In one of the nation's largest restoration projects, NASA technology helps state and federal government reclaim of salt evaporation ponds in South San Francisco Bay. Satellite sensors are used by scientists to study the effect of salt evaporation on local ecology. NASA has started Energy Efficiency and Water Conservation Program as an agency-wide program directed to prevent pollution and reduce energy and water utilization. It helps to ensure that NASA meets its federal stewardship responsibilities for the environment. ==Earth science== Earth from the International Space Station Understanding of natural and human-induced changes on the global environment (such as global warming) is the main objective of NASA's Earth science. NASA currently has more than a dozen Earth science spacecraft/instruments in orbit studying all aspects of the Earth system (oceans, land, atmosphere, biosphere, cryosphere), with several more planned for launch in the next few years. The earth science research program was created and funded in the 1980s under the administrations of Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush. NASA is working in cooperation with National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). The goal is to produce worldwide solar resource maps with great local detail. NASA was also one of the main participants in the evaluation innovative technologies for the cleanup of the sources for dense non-aqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs). On April 6, 1999, the agency signed The Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) along with the United States Environmental Protection Agency, DOE, and USAF authorizing all the above organizations to conduct necessary tests at the John F. Kennedy Space center. The main purpose was to evaluate two innovative in-situ remediation technologies, thermal removal and oxidation destruction of DNAPLs. National Space Agency made a partnership with Military Services and Defense Contract Management Agency named the \\"Joint Group on Pollution Prevention\\". The group is working on reduction or elimination of hazardous materials or processes. On May 8, 2003, Environmental Protection Agency recognized NASA as the first federal agency to directly use landfill gas to produce energy at one of its facilities—the Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland. Ozone depletion Ozone Depletion on Earth In 1975, NASA was directed by legislation to research and monitor the upper atmosphere. This led to Upper Atmosphere Research Program and later the Earth Observing System (EOS) satellites in the 1990s to monitor ozone depletion. The first comprehensive worldwide measurements were obtained in 1978 with the Nimbus 7 satellite and NASA scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies. Ozone is colorless gas. Its a very active chemically. Near the Earth’s surface, those reactions cause rubber to crack, hurt plant life, and damage people’s lung tissues. But ozone also absorbs harmful components of sunlight, known as “ultraviolet B”, or “UV-B”. High above the surface, above even the weather systems, a tenuous layer of ozone gas absorbs UV-B, protecting living things below. Climate study Within the earth science program, NASA researches and publishes on climate issues. Its statements concur with the interpretation that the global climate is heating. Bob Walker, who has advised president-elect Donald Trump on space issues, has advocated that NASA shut down its climate study operations. The Washington Post reported that NASA scientists are copying data on climate change that is held on U.S. government computers, out of a fear that a Trump administration would end access to data on climate change.  Space Weather  Auroras in sky Conditions on the Sun and in the solar wind, magnetosphere, ionosphere and thermosphere that can influence the performance and reliability of space-borne and ground-based technological systems and can endanger human life or health. Space weather can also create lot of the problems on the earth. Space weather also can create lot of auroras. But it can also disturb satellites that exchange signals from earth to space and from space to earth. It can cause you losing mobile networks on earth as well as internet. It can also affect lot of electrical grids on the earth or its even dangerous for the astronauts that are living in the International Space Station because of the radiation levels. == TESS Satellite Research == TESS Satellite On April 18, 2018 NASA launched a satellite called NASA Planet Hunting Satellite where it roams around in orbit and tries finding different planets and area that hasn't been found from earth scientists yet. This satellite is also known as TESS(Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite). The two planets that they found are now known as Rocky planet and its slightly larger than earth and the other two planets are gaseous and roughly double Earth's size. Rocky planet is around 73 light years away which is also known as habitable zone which means it is far enough from a neighboring star to be able to host water. Stephen Kane who is professor of astronomy said \\"They have found very few planets like this in habitable zone, as many fewer around a quiet star so this is rare.\\" Researchers have said in past that it will be unlikely for humans to stay on Rocky Planet because it has a thick atmosphere that traps all the heat and could make the planet super hot. Researchers will continue their researches after their upcoming launch of James Webb Space Telescope in 2021. TESS Satellite uses four large cameras to watch sections of the sky for 27 days at a time. It is focused on stars closer than 200 light years from Earth's Solar System. == Kepler Mission == Kepler Telescope NASA's Kepler mission in May 2016 verified 1,284 new planets – the single largest finding of exoplanets to date – more than doubling the number of confirmed planets from Kepler. Analysis was performed on the Kepler space telescope’s July planet candidate catalog, which identified 4,302 potential planets. This telescope was also designed to check parts of the milky way galaxy to search exoplanets. In 2013 Kepler was assigned a mission called \\"K2\\". Two of the reaction wheels of spacecraft failed, so the engineers made a better and smarter plan to redesign the mission. K2 mission was still searching for exoplanets and different planets in the space however it was doing it different way, it was scanning a larger swath of sky than before along with ecliptic plane. == Asteroid sampling mission == Asteroid Sampling Aircraft on September 8, 2016, NASA launched its first asteroid sampling mission from florida. Aircraft will circle around in orbit around sun for about a year and than they use earth gravitational for it to start its journey towards bennu. In august 2018, the aircraft will start its approach towards bennu. After the landing the aircraft will start doing its survey and after the survey the aircraft will softly land on bennu for five seconds with the help of its small rocket thrusts. It will softly grab the sample of the asteroid and retrieve it. In march 2021 the window is scheduled to be open for the aircraft to return and it will begin its journey back to earth. == Exobiology == The goal of Exobiology program is to understand the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the universe.Research is centered on the origin and early evolution of life, the potential of life to adapt to different environments, and the implications for life elsewhere. This research is conducted in the context of NASA’s ongoing exploration of our stellar neighborhood and the identification of bio signatures for in situ and remote sensing applications. Exobiology is concerned with four evolutionary periods: # cosmic evolution of biogenic elements and compounds # prebiotic evolution # early evolution of life # evolution of advanced life ==ReferencesSee also== *NASA spin-off technologies Category:NASA Category:Government research Category:Environmental research Category:Space medicine Category:Astronomy projects Category:Research in the United States Category:Aeronautics ","title":"NASA research"},{"id":"46381112","text":"Euaspidoceras perarmatum is an extinct ammonoid cephalopod species that lived during the Jurassic.

The largest Hindenburg Amnesty, in terms of the numbers released, took place in 1925, but there were further amnesties also termed Hindenburg Amnesties in 1928, 1932 and 1934. The background to the amnesties was the conviction of political extremists in the wake of the Revolutionary period of 1918-1919 that had followed military defeat in the First World War. During the 1920s the political emergency subsided and democratic government began to take root in Germany. The 1925 Hindenburg Amnesty took place shortly after the election of Paul von Hindenburg as the country's president. It involved the release of approximately 29,000 people and came at the request of virtually all the political parties represented in the Reichstag, including the Communist and Nazi parties.Jürgen Christoph: Die politischen Reichsamnestien 1918 - 1933, Lang, Frankfurt a.M. [u.a.] 1988, S. 397. Grounds for the amnesties included a very widespread belief that the extent of the trials and convictions that had followed in the wake of economic and political collapse at the end of the war had simply overwhelmed the judicial system, which continued to lack the capacity, in terms of qualified judges and court staff, to redress the accumulation of judicial wrongs on a case by case basis. Inevitably the process also came to be seen increasingly as a political exercise whereby extremist parties that were now gaining some measure of acceptance with the political establishment could extract their own leaders from jails. High- profile beneficiaries of the Hindenburg Amnesties who later became key figures in the political establishment included Hermann Göring, Martin Bormann and Rudolf Höß. Beneficiaries from the other political extreme included Otto Franke. ==References== Category:Weimar Republic Category:Legal history of Germany Category:Politics of the Weimar Republic Category:Paul von Hindenburg Category:1920s in Germany Category:1930s in Germany ","title":"Hindenburg Amnesties"},{"id":"46381135","text":"Nasrin Kadri (, ; born September 2, 1986) is an Israeli-Arab singer of traditional Middle Eastern/Mizrahi music.

Located on the banks of Pushaw Stream, the site has yielded evidence of human habitation between c. 3000 BCE and 1000 CE, and included human burials. The site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. ==Description== The Young Site is located on the north bank of Pushaw Stream, a tributary of the Penobscot River, not far from its confluence with Dead Stream in southern Alton. On the opposite bank, in the Hirundo Wildlife Refuge, is a second site known as the Hirundo Site. Analysis of the geology of the area suggests that, at the time of the earliest dated occupations of these sites, a lake was located just upstream, which periodically inundated one or the other of the sites, and was probably surrounded by marshes with cattails. The oldest materials at Young are from the Laurentian tradition, including several projectile points typical of that period. The burial found at the site dates to the Susquehanna period (c. 1700 BCE), determined by both radiocarbon dating and by the method of burial, which included cremation. The latest period of occupation was found to be the Late Ceramic (c. 1000 CE), although occupation continued for a longer period at Hirundo. Also recovered from the site were more than 30 types of fish vertebrae, suggesting fishing was a major activity at the site. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Penobscot County, Maine ==References== Category:Archaeological sites on the National Register of Historic Places in Maine Category:Penobscot County, Maine Category:National Register of Historic Places in Penobscot County, Maine ","title":"Young Site"},{"id":"46381169","text":"Leif Tsolis (born December 7, 1976) is a Norwegian association football coach. == Early career == From 2001-2006 Tsolis was the head coach for the U-group 2 in Vålerenga Fotball youth department on the men's side and a coach coordinator at the same time.

Albert himself started working when he reached the age of ten, delivering milk and bread products to middle-class homes in the early mornings. This involved starting work at four in the morning, from which he later claimed to have acquired a useful talent for getting by without very much sleep. Later he received a training as a waiter, and worked in this profession till 1904. In 1904 he relocated to Bremen where he worked as a machinist before joining the crew of a merchant steamer as a fireman and sailor. During this time he visited Britain and for the first time came across asn example of a workers' strike, something which he later recalled made a strong impression on him. While still a young man he joined the Social Democratic Party (SPD). He obtained a job as a mechanic/fitter with the railways, working on the network's signal boxes. In 1912 he left the SPD, as his political sympathies moved towards Anarcho- syndicalism. During the immediate prewar years he was an employee of the Trades Union Press. After that he was drafted into the army and served in the First World War as a radio operator. In 1917 the SPD (party) split, primarily over the issue of continuing support for the war. By the time the war ended, towards the end of 1918, Hotopp had become a member of the anti-war Independent Social Democratic Party (USDP) which had been the left-wing breakaway group. He participated in the German Revolution of 1918–19. The period was one of ongoing splintering and reconfiguration on the political left in Germany, and in 1920 Hotopp switched his political allegiance, like many USDP members, to the recently formed German Communist Party. By now he was working as a fireman and crane operator: he was also active on the works council. He also held a position in the regional communist party and, from 1923, was undertaking courier work for The Party. Following a strike he was convicted of preparing to commit High Treason and sentenced to a four-year jail term most of which he served, between 1923 and 1926, in Cottbus. It was during this time that he began to write, producing narrative pieces that were published in the left-wing Rote Fahne (\\"Red Flag\\" newspaper). He was released early, in 1926, after which he headed up the Party policy team in the Berlin Prenzlauer Berg district and served on the local council till 1929. He joined the Red Front Fighters and, in 1928, the Association of Proletarian- Revolutionary Authors, through which he formed a close friendship with fellow- writer Willi Bredel. Hotopp's own priorities were evident, however, from his description of his writing as a \\"bye-products of [work as] a party official\\".\\"...\\"Nebenprodukte eines Parteifunktionärs\\" In 1933 the NSDAP (Nazi Party) took power, and there was a rapid transition to one- party government in Germany. All political parties (other than the Nazi Party) were now illegal, but the new Chancellor had, in opposition, been particularly vitriolic about the Communist Party. Till February 1934 Albert Hotopp continued to live, now illegally, in Germany, working as a Communist Party treasurer. He then emigrated to the Soviet Union, living in Moscow with his wife, Gertrud and their two daughters. He worked in German language publishing and, under the \\"party name\\" of \\"Hermann Lieben\\" as a teacher at the Institute for Foreign Languages. There were numerous exiled German communists in Moscow, and they all used to report on one another to the Soviet authorities during the surge in political purges that accompanied growing political tensions domestically and internationally at this time. Such information demonstrated loyalty and was often blended with impressions or combined with denunciations. Hotropp himself provided a written report on Herwarth Walden, a fellow teacher at the Foreign Languages Institute who was later arrested. There was a perception that reports of this nature did not in themselves cause the authorities to arrest suspects, but they were certainly used by the NKVD where they provided evidential support for arrests that took place. Albert Hotopp's own turn came on 31 May 1941 when he was arrested. On 1 August 1942 he was condemned to death. Available records are silent as to what happened next, but it is likely that he died shortly afterwards, probably in a Soviet labour camp. His wife Gertrud and their daughters were sent to continue their lives in Kazakhstan. His widow finally made her way back to East Germany in 1955, after which she survived another thirty years. Albert Hotopp was formally rehabilitated by the Soviets in 1960. ==Output== Albert Hotopp's best known book is the novel, Fischkutter H.F. 13: it provides a realistic presentation of life at sea from a Communist perspective. Three subsequent narrative works that appeared in the Soviet Union had as their principal themes Workers' Life, Experiences of War and Resistance to Naziism. ==References== Category:20th- century German writers Category:German resistance members Category:Victims of human rights abuses Category:1886 births Category:1942 deaths ","title":"Albert Hotopp"},{"id":"46381278","text":"Raúl Castro (born 1931) is the 18th President of Cuba (2008-2018) and First Secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba (2011-present).

Her design was similar to that of the preceding Drake class sloops but larger and more heavily armed. Construction was contracted to civilian shipwright Thomas West, who had overseen construction of a year earlier. As designed, Wolfs dimensions were in keeping with other vessels of her class with an overall length of , a beam of and measuring 243 tonnes burthen. She had two masts, square-rigged and supported by a trysail mast aft of the main mast. Two decks were fitted instead of one, reflecting the design of her predecessor, the 1731 .McLaughlan 2014, p. 169 Constructed with eight pairs of gunports, she was initially supplied with fourteen four-pounder cannons in addition to twelve deck-mounted half-pounder swivel guns. Construction took seven months from the laying of the keel in July 1741 to launch in February 1742, at a building cost of £1,793 and an additional ₤1,653 for fitting out. ==Naval career== Wolf was commissioned into the Navy at Deptford Dockyard in early February 1742 and launched at the end of that month under the command of Lieutenant Samuel Loftin. Internal fitout continued until April, after which Wolf was sailed to Svalbard as convoy protection for the English whaling fleet. Privateer hunter At the end of the whaling season Wolf returned south to join the blockade of Spanish ports established as part of the War of Jenkins' Ear. On 11 December 1742 Wolf overhauled and captured a Spanish privateer, Nuestra Señora del Pilar y Animas. Two more privateers were captured in March 1743; the San Pedro y Animas on 5 March, and the Nuestra Señora de la Esclavitud on the 17th. Lieutenant Loftin left the vessel in late 1743 and was replaced by Commander Richard Haddock in January of the following year. Wolfs success in privateer hunting continued, with the capture of Spanish ships La Notre Dame de Boulogne on 30 June 1744, and La Palme on 30 July. In September Haddock was replaced by Commander (later Admiral) Augustus Keppel, who had recently returned to England after taking part in George Anson's voyage around the world. Keppel vacated his command three months later in favour of Lieutenant Thomas Stanhope, under whose authority Wolf was removed from Spanish patrol and reassigned to the English Channel. Capture and recapture Stanhope was replaced in July 1745 by Commander John Hughes, with Wolf remaining at her previous post in the English Channel. On 29 October 1745 she was on patrol off the Channel Islands when she encountered and was defeated by a 32-gun French privateer. Commander Hughes and two other English sailors were killed in the battle, and three more were wounded. The outgunned Wolf was then surrendered to the French, who converted her for privateering and renamed her La Loup. Wolfs French service was cut short four months later, when on 1 March 1746 she was run down and retaken by the Royal Navy frigates and . The battered sloop was returned to Plymouth as a prize. After a year in port she was repurchased by Admiralty on 6 March 1747 and transferred to Plymouth Dockyard for repair. A five month refit was completed at a total cost of ₤1,887, slightly more than her original construction cost in 1742. Relaunch and wreck The rebuilt Wolf was commissioned in July 1747 under Commander George Vachel, and relaunched in August for service against the French in what was now the War of the Austrian Succession. The following year was spent on patrol duties in the North Sea and off the Irish coast. On 31 December 1748 Wolf was caught in heavy seas and driven towards the Irish shore. Despite efforts by her crew she was wrecked in the bay below Dundrum Castle and sank with the loss of all on board. ==Citations== Notes References ==Bibliography== * * * Category:1742 ships Category:Ships built in Deptford Category:Sloops of the Royal Navy ","title":"HMS Wolf (1742)"},{"id":"46381335","text":"Nadie me dirá como quererte is a Venezuela telenovela written by Martín Hahn and produced by Radio Caracas Televisión in 2008.

Originally the theory was developed within a psychoanalytical framework, by psychoanalyst and researcher Joseph Weiss, MD (1924-2004). CMT is also a theory of how the mind operates, with an emphasis of the unconscious, and how psychological problems may develop based on traumatic experiences early in life. The name of the theory comes from two central premises; the assumption that people have control over their mental content, and the belief that patients who come to therapy are fundamentally motivated to master their lives. ==History== The one-page article, \\"Crying at the happy ending\\" (Weiss, 1952), has been considered to mark the point where Weiss began to formulate the ideas underlying CMT. In this short article he described the phenomenon of delay of affect, where an emotion that connects to a particular upsetting situation is warded off until the situation has passed, and it is perceived safe to release the emotion. Following this Weiss turned to focus on how patients make progress in therapy. Through studying detailed process notes of psychotherapy sessions, he identified segments thought to mark therapeutic progress, and looked at what immediately preceded such instances. Progress within sessions was defined as the emergence of new material or behavior. He concluded that patients make progress in therapy when they feel safe in the therapeutic relationship, and that patients continually make appraisals of conditions of safety in relation to others. Some of the ideas that helped form CMT were mentioned in certain passages of Freud's later writings, but the basic concepts of the theory were developed through Weiss's study of psychotherapy notes. In 1965, Weiss was joined by Harold Sampson, PhD (1925-2015). They met daily to collaborate on researching Weiss' theories. Formal research on the theory began in 1972 when Joseph Weiss together with Harold Sampson founded the Mount Zion Psychotherapy Research Group (now known as the San Francisco Psychotherapy Research Group; SFPRG). This research was based on the assumption that while therapeutic processes will be case- specific, there are also some common and lawful principles that govern how psychotherapy works, or fail to work. In 2017 an additional group was formed called the International Control Mastery Therapy Center (CMTC) whose goal is to help disseminate the theories of CMT worldwide( see CMTCenter.Net). ==Core principles== Psychopathology stem from pathogenic beliefs that have developed from traumatic experiences According to CMT, psychological problems (of non-biological origin) largely come from pathogenic beliefs that have developed as a result of traumatic experiences, typically occurring in childhood. Trauma in CMT is broadly defined as experiences that impair a person's normal growth and development, with an emphasis on interpersonal experiences. Pathogenic beliefs are intrapsychic structures of distorted ideas of the self in relation to the world. These beliefs hold the patient back because they suggest pursuing developmentally normal and healthy life goals will result in terrible consequences for one self or loved ones. Pathogenic beliefs are often unconscious, but deeply rooted, and associated with negative emotions such as anxiety or guilt. Though the pathogenic beliefs in themselves may be irrational, exaggerated or incorrect, CMT holds that they are generally based on real experiences. The traumas underlying these beliefs could either be \\"shock traumas\\" or \\"stress traumas\\". Shock traumas are sudden and dramatic single events that are perceived as frightening and overwhelming, while stress traumas are repetitive events that over time create strain. In further explaining how pathogenic beliefs develop, CMT starts with the assumption that humans through evolution are geared towards adaptation. In agreement with attachment theory, CMT acknowledges that the young child is dependent on the family for survival and emotional security, and therefore highly motivated to adapt to the family environment and maintain emotional bonds to significant others. Further, in alignment with findings from infant research, CMT assumes that children from infancy start forming and testing hypotheses about the world. As a result of this adaptive process they infer beliefs about themselves, others and their environment. However, since children have limited life experience, and not fully developed cognitive abilities, they sometimes draw false conclusions. Difficulties with understanding and interpreting traumatic experiences could result in the formation of pathogenic beliefs. Further, a core principle in CMT is the notion that behavior is thought to be regulated by perceptions of safety versus danger. When traumatic events or interchanges occur, children will attempt to understand what caused the event and what they might do to avoid it. Therefore, another component thought to be important for the formation of pathogenic beliefs, is the unconscious need to maintain a feeling of safety. For example, a child who has been abused by a caregiver might infer that the abuse happened because of something they themselves did, and that it was deserved. This belief might make them feel safer than assuming their caregiver is unpredictable and dangerous. If such experiences persist, the child might internalize a pathogenic belief that they are bad, and deserve to be mistreated. Though most pathogenic beliefs come from attempts at adaptation, they ultimately become maladaptive, as they inflict suffering and hinder the person from pursuing important life goals. Pathogenic beliefs may also develop after traumatic experiences in adulthood, but children are generally viewed as more vulnerable because of their cognitive level, and their dependence on others. In CMT, children are understood to be intensely loyal to their parents, and also driven by prosocial concern for the well-being of their family members. For these reasons, pathogenic beliefs resulting from traumatic experiences with significant others is thought to have a moral component. They are not only beliefs about how things actually operate in the world, but also about how things morally should be. The interpersonal manifestations of pathogenic beliefs, where the patient repeats negative experiences from childhood, are called compliances and pathogenic identifications. A compliance would be when a person thinks that the way he or she was mistreated as a child, is the correct way he or she should be treated. A pathogenic identification would be when a person repeats the traumatizing behaviors of a parent, and believes it is morally correct to treat others in this way. Patients are motivated and have a plan for the therapy CMT posits that patients who come to therapy are motivated to master their trauma, and overcome their pathogenic beliefs. In addition, it is thought that the patient has an unconscious plan for how they will get better, which involves how they will test pathogenic beliefs with the therapist. The most important task of the therapist is to create conditions of safety to allow the patient to carry on with their plan, and react to the patient in ways that will help disconfirm their pathogenic beliefs. Interventions that are successful in achieving this are called pro- plan, while interventions that the patient perceive as confirming a pathogenic belief are considered anti-plan and a hindrance to therapeutic progress. Weiss described that there are three primary ways pathogenic beliefs may become disconfirmed or less powerful; 1) by use of the therapeutic relationship in itself, 2) by gaining insight through interpretations that help disconfirm such beliefs, or 3) when the patient tests a pathogenic belief directly with the therapist, and the therapist reacts in a way that help disconfirm the belief (passes the test). Treatment by attitudes Interpersonal relationships are seen as inherently transformative in CMT, and the therapeutic relationship is seen as a context where the patient is motivated and change is likely to occur under the right conditions. It is held that the therapeutic relationship in itself may help patients overcome pathogenic beliefs, through what is called treatment by attitude. Therapists are assumed to consciously and unconsciously convey attitudes about the patient through their actions, words, silences, mannerisms, and affective responses or the lack of them. Similarly, the patient is assumed to be especially attentive, both consciously and unconsciously, toward therapist attitudes that relate to their own goals and pathogenic beliefs. It is believed that the therapeutic relationship may be transformative when the patient feels safe in the relationship, and perceives the therapist's attitudes toward them as disconfirming a pathogenic belief. Treatment by attitude may be planned according to the therapist's understanding of the patient's history and psychology, or happen spontaneously and outside the conscious awareness of either participant. The concept of treatment by attitudes can be likened to the concept of the corrective emotional experience described by Alexander and French in 1946, but there are some differences. In CMT, the therapeutic work is viewed more as a collaborative effort. CMT underlines that patients play an active role in seeking out experiences that will lead to progress, and coach the therapists in how to help them. Patients coach the therapist The concept of coaching is unique to CMT, and refers to patient behaviors and communications designed to attune the therapist to the patient's conscious and unconscious goals, and how best to address the patient's issues. Through coaching the therapist, the patient informs and guides the therapist in how to most efficiently support them in carrying out their plan for treatment. Coaching behaviors are thought to be most prevalent at the beginning of therapy, as well as before, during and after presenting important tests to the therapist. Also, coaching may be used to alter the therapeutic relationship, for example when patients want to change their strategy for disconfirming pathogenic beliefs. Patients test the therapist The concept of testing in CMT has been described as a transference phenomenon. When testing the therapist, the patient recreates previous interpersonal experiences in the therapeutic relationship, hoping to gain new emotional experiences or insight that will help disconfirm pathogenic beliefs. A test is a sort of trial action a patient initiates with the purpose of checking the validity of a pathogenic belief. It can happen in a discrete episode, or as part of an ongoing process in the therapy. Normally testing is thought to happen outside of the patient's conscious awareness. If the therapist responds to a test in a way that is helpful in challenging the patient's pathogenic belief, this is called passing the test. The therapist needs to observe the patient's behavior and emotional reactions in order to understand if they have passed or failed a test. Research on CMT support the assumption that patients will access new material and be more relaxed and friendly after passed tests, while failed tests may lead to patients feeling insecure and defensive. There are two categories of testing strategies in CMT; transference tests and passive-into-active tests. In a transference test, the patient will behave in ways that he or she has experienced to elicit traumatizing responses from significant others in the past. For example, if the patient experienced that a parent diminished his or her accomplishments growing up, they may have a pathogenic belief that displaying pride will threaten others. To test this belief, they may either put themselves down in the hope that the therapist will disagree, or alternatively display pride in the hope that the therapist will be able to share the joy and not reject such behavior. If the therapist in this example would respond in a supportive manner when the patient shows pride, they are likely to pass the test and make the patient feel at ease and move in the direction of discarding the pathogenic belief. Conversely, if the therapist perceives the patient as bragging and reacts negatively or with silence, they might fail the test and thereby hinder the patient in making progress. The other strategy of testing, passive-into-active tests, involve patients themselves repeating behaviors that once traumatized them, in the hope that the therapist will not be equally overwhelmed. If the therapist tolerates this, and is successful in modeling a way of handling this behavior without losing integrity, they are likely to pass the test. If the therapist gives signs of being traumatized by the patient, it is likely that the patient will have difficulty believing the therapy will help them. The phenomenon of turning passive into active was first described by Freud, but has been given increased attention and significance in CMT. The role of unconscious guilt The concept of unconscious guilt is important in CMT. It relates to the view that humans are essentially prosocial beings from childhood and onwards, and loyal to the family in particular. In dysfunctional families, this prosocial instinct may contribute to feelings of irrational guilt over having caused trouble, or failed to fix the family's problem. In contrast to the traditional psychoanalytical view of guilt, where guilt is understood as resulting from an unconscious aggressive instinct or wish to harm others, CMT sees guilt as derived from altruism. Guilt is thereby defined as a painful emotion arising from a belief that one has harmed others, designed to protect attachments. From this understanding, guilt can be seen as adaptive when it serves to encourage good conduct and maintain relational bonds. But when guilt is exaggerated, irrational, generalized or repeatedly linked to shame it becomes maladaptive. Different types of unconscious guilt have been outlined within CMT, and two types that have been held up as especially important are survivor guilt and separation guilt. They both involve an exaggerated sense of responsibility for the welfare of others. Survivor guilt arises from perceiving oneself to be better off than a loved one, and relates to the irrational idea that there is a fixed amount of happiness to go around. Thereby one can imagine that one's success comes at the expense of someone else, and feel it is unfair or undeserved. Survivor guilt can also be literal, and arise after the death of a loved one. Separation guilt has by some been described as developmental guilt, as it relates to the belief that one will hurt loved ones by growing up, individualizing and becoming different from the family. CMT describes unconscious guilt as closely intertwined with pathogenic beliefs, and guilt is assumed to play an important role in patients' transference reactions. ==Research== The development of CMT has been driven forward by an interplay between clinical observations, theory development and empirical research. Some of this research has been psychotherapy research, and in other studies predictions from CMT have been tested or explored outside of the therapeutic setting. Psychotherapy research Most of the psychotherapy research has been carried out on completed therapies which were recorded and transcribed, and where neither the therapist nor the patient was familiar with the theory. The goal has been to investigate how psychotherapy works regardless of the therapist's orientation or approach. The main tool for studying and evaluating these psychotherapies has been the case formulation. CMT researchers have attempted to operationalize the clinical process of understanding a case, in order to assess and increase agreement between different clinical judges adhering to CMT. The first attempt to assess whether it was possible for trained judges to formulate reliable case formulations based on CMT were done by Caston (1986). In several studies applying this procedure on brief therapies, the interjudge reliabilities were found to be high, typically between .7 and .9. Curtis and Silberschatz later modified and revised the procedure, and termed it the Plan Formulation Method (1991). The Plan Formulation Method, or PFM, is a comprehensive case formulation method that was developed primarily for clinical research on CMT. Plan formulations developed for psychotherapy research are based on reviews of transcripts from early therapy sessions. A plan formulation starts with a description of the patient, including his or her current life circumstances and presenting complaints. Beyond that, a control mastery plan formulation consists of the following elements: *Traumas: Experiences that may have led to the development of pathogenic beliefs. *Goals: The patient's conscious and unconscious goals for therapy. *Obstructions: Pathogenic beliefs that are inhibiting the patient from attaining or pursuing his or her goals. *Tests: Ways in which the patient is likely to work in therapy to check the validity of pathogenic beliefs. *Insights: Information that may be helpful to the patient in order to disprove pathogenic beliefs and overcome obstructions. Research on the PFM has consistently demonstrated that trained independent judges can achieve a high degree of agreement in formulating case formulations based on CMT concepts, including traumas, goals, obstructions, tests and insights. A large body of research support that patients bring out new material when they feel safe in the therapeutic relationship, and that patients make progress when therapist's passes tests or make plan-compatible interpretations, that help contradict pathogenic beliefs. When analyzing recorded therapies, trained judges reliably agree on when in a session a patient is testing the therapist, and whether or not the therapist's response fails or passes the test. Other CMT research A measure called the Interpersonal Guilt Questionnaire (IGQ) has been developed to assess patients' types and levels of guilt, and how they relate to each other. An empirical study using this questionnaire demonstrated a connection between guilt and traumatic childhood experiences, and also between guilt and psychopathology. ==Clinical application== CMT is not a school of therapy per se, and does not clearly define a set of therapeutic techniques. Rather, CMT may be said to be more of a theoretical framework used to formulate cases and guide the therapist's approach to treatment. The CMT plan formulation is an important clinical tool in this respect. It is considered a working hypothesis that provides predictions about how patients will react to interventions in therapy, which is continually revised as more information becomes apparent. In CMT-informed treatment the therapeutic interventions will be case-specific, meaning that interventions will be tailored to the plan formulation developed for the patient, in contrast to being diagnosis-specific. The idea is that patients with similar presenting problems may have different underlying traumas, and that the therapist's interventions will only be successful to the degree that it may help patients overcome their unique pathogenic beliefs. Clinical applications of the theory have been explored with a range of different target populations and problems. For example, there have been written articles on CMT-informed clinical work with couples, families, children, trauma survivors, and individuals with depression and addiction. ==Theoretical integration and similarities== CMT was primarily developed through an empirical approach, and not through gradually assimilating concepts from other theories. Joseph Weiss developed several hypotheses of how psychotherapy works through his study of psychotherapy notes, which have since been tested and refined. However, it is clear that the concepts of CMT are similar to ideas developed within many different fields of psychology. CMT's psychodynamic roots are evident in the emphasis on the unconscious life. Weiss (1993) wrote that CMT could be viewed as an object relations theory, and is closely related to Heinz Kohut's self psychology, as these theories have in common the focus on how problems often arise in early experiences with significant others. The understanding of how the child observes the world, represents events, and infers cause and effect corresponds with theory and research from developmental psychology and cognitive psychology, such as Daniel Stern's infant research, John Bowlby's attachment theory, and Piaget's theory of cognitive development. Pathogenic beliefs may also be compared to the cognitive concept of schemas developed by Aaron T. Beck and used in schema therapy. Some have also pointed out that CMT has similarities with humanistic psychology in the non-pathologizing, client- centered approach and shared focus on mastery. ==Criticisms== CMT might be subjected to some of the same general criticisms directed toward other similar theories. For example, a common feminist critique of traditional object relations theories is the claim that such theories tend to \\"blame the mother\\" for a child's negative development. Although CMT has a strong focus on the role of early childhood experiences, it is also open to the idea that pathogenic beliefs can arise in adulthood. Further, CMT does not hold that pathogenic beliefs only develop in dysfunctional families; other kinds of traumatic events could also contribute, as well as how children interpret events based on their developmental level. In a review of Silberschatz's book on CMT, Transformative Relationships (2005), Les Greenberg noted that CMT seems to focus heavily on the concept of unconscious guilt. Greenberg praised the book overall, but cautioned that although CMT claims to prescribe a case- specific approach to psychological treatment, it will be difficult to make observations completely independent of the theory, and that certain concepts such as guilt may thereby be given too much weight overall. Nancy McWilliams has claimed that some pathogenic beliefs will be too complex to capture in a single statement. Further, McWilliams underlined that passing tests may not be enough to change the underlying pathogenic beliefs in itself, if the client does not yet have an understanding of how the beliefs came to develop, or gained understanding of what goes on in the transference. In an article published in journal of the Norwegian Psychological Association, Binder and Holgersen (2008) raised the question of whether the semantics in the concept of the patient's \\"plan\\" may attribute too much rationality and linearity to the unconscious. Further, as CMT draws on research and theory from different traditions within psychology, they pointed to the challenge in integrating research and theory into a cohesive and easily testable whole. Finally, it has been argued that CMT builds on inherently western values, and that there may be a need for more careful consideration of cultural factors when developing plan formulations. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * * ==External links== *Introduction to Control Mastery Theory from the official webpage of San Francisco Psychotherapy Research Group *Founders of Control Mastery Theory from the official webpage of San Francisco Psychotherapy Research Group Category:Psychodynamics Category:Psychotherapy ","title":"Control mastery theory"},{"id":"46381413","text":"The 1995–96 VfL Bochum season was the 58th season in club history. ==Review and events== The 1995–96 season was the first season in German football where teams received three points for a win (instead of two), and one point for a draw.

She works as a janitor at a hospital. She had a one-night stand with Wataru Makino (Tori Matsuzaka) who is a sex addict and a womanizer getting his way with beautiful women by lying about being a very good surgeon and many other things. Ayumi later realizes that she is pregnant because of that one night stand. When she tells Wataru that she is pregnant, Wataru believes she is a making a bad April Fools joke. Wataru Makino then takes flight attendant Reiko (Nanao) out to an Italian restaurant.

After being sold as a foal, he was sent to England and trained for a National Hunt racing career by Oliver Sherwood. He won a National Hunt Flat race and two Novice hurdle races before moving to steeplechases as a six-year-old in the autumn of 2013. In his first season over fences, he won twice as well as finishing second in the Grade 2 Reynoldstown Novices' Chase and fourth in the Grade 1 Mildmay Novices' Chase. He emerged as a top-class chaser in the following season, winning his first three races including the Hennessy Gold Cup and the Cotswold Chase before disappointing when strongly fancied for the Cheltenham Gold Cup. On 11 April 2015, ridden as in all of his previous races by Leighton Aspell, he carried 11 stone 9 pound to victory in the Grand National at Aintree Racecourse. Many Clouds won one race in the following season but finished unplaced when joint-favourite for the 2016 Grand National. In January 2017, he beat the previously undefeated Thistlecrack in winning his second Cotswold Chase but collapsed and died of an exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage shortly after crossing the finish line. He was subsequently assessed as the leading staying steeplechaser in Britain and Ireland for the 2016–17 season. ==Background== Many Clouds was a \\"big, old-fashioned\\" brown gelding bred in Ireland by Aidan Aherne at the Windward House Stud in County Cork. He was one of several good jumpers sired by Cloudings, a son of Sadler's Wells, who won the Prix Lupin in 1997. Many Clouds' dam, Bobbing Back, has also produced The Tullow Tank, winner of the Royal Bond Novice Hurdle and the Future Champions Novice Hurdle. In November 2007, Many Clouds was consigned as a colt foal to the Tattersalls sales where he was bought for €6,000 by Highflyer Bloodstock. Many Clouds was trained throughout his racing career by Oliver Sherwood at Upper Lambourn in Berkshire and ridden in all of his races by Leighton Aspell. ==Racing career== 2011–12 National Hunt season Many Clouds began his racing career in National Hunt Flat races. He won on his debut at Wetherby Racecourse in February but then finished behind Champagne Fever at the Cheltenham Festival in March and behind The New One at Aintree in April. 2012–13 National Hunt season In his second season, Many Clouds ran in Novice hurdle races. After finishing second at Aintree in October, he won over two and a half miles at Ascot Racecourse a month later. He went on to finish second at Wetherby and win at Exeter Racecourse before being moved up in class and finishing second in the Grade 3 European Breeders' Fund Novices' Handicap Hurdle Final at Sandown Park in March. On his final start of the season, he was matched against more experienced hurdlers in the Injured Jockeys Fund Handicap Hurdle at Aintree in April but was pulled up by Aspell two flights from home. 2013–14 National Hunt season Many Clouds began to race over fences in the following season, competing in novice chases. On his debut over the larger obstacles, he won over two and a half miles at Carlisle Racecourse in November, beating the highly regarded Holywell into third place. Later that month, he finished second to Black Thunder at Haydock Park before winning at odds of 8/15 at Wetherby in December. At Ascot on 15 February he was stepped up in class for the Grade 2 Reynoldstown Novices' Chase and finished second, beaten two and a half lengths by O'Faolains Boy. He made his second appearance at the Cheltenham Festival in March when he started a 16/1 outsider for the Grade 1 RSA Chase in which he was brought down at the fourteenth fence. He ended his first season as a chaser by finishing fourth to Holywell in the Mildmay Novices' Chase at Aintree. 2014–15 National Hunt season Many Clouds began his next season in the Colin Parker Memorial Chase at Carlisle in November. He took the lead three fences from the finish and won from the favourite Eduard (winner of the Future Champion Novices' Chase), with Holywell fifteen lengths back in third. Later that month, Many Clouds was assigned a weight of 11 stone 6 pounds for the 58th running of the Hennessy Gold Cup over three and a quarter miles at Newbury Racecourse. Starting at odds of 8/1 in a nineteen-runner field, he took the lead at the last fence and stayed on strongly to win by three and a quarter lengths form Houblon des Obeaux. Aspell was given a seven-day ban for excessive use of the whip on the winner. Sherwood, however, who was winning the race for the first time since Arctic Call's victory in 1990, said, \\"It was a great ride from Leighton. I am chuffed to bits, he is a very tough horse and I am delighted for the whole team.\\" In January, Many Clouds started at odds of 4/1 for the Grade 2 Cotswold Chase at Cheltenham. He disputed the lead from the start and stayed on strongly over the last two fences to win from Smad Place, Dynaste, The Giant Bolster, and Black Thunder. The performance established Many Clouds as a leading contender for the Cheltenham Gold Cup. After the race Sherwood said, \\"I think he's improved again and his confidence is sky-high. Leighton was adamant there would be no pace and he would be handy. I think he was dossing after the last, there's a bit more to come and he's a live Gold Cup horse.\\" On 13 March, Many Clouds started joint-second-favourite at odds of 7/1 in a sixteen-runner field for the Cheltenham Gold Cup. After racing in mid- division, he stayed on in the closing stages without ever looking likely to win and finished sixth behind Coneygree. For the Grand National on 11 April Many Clouds was assigned a weight of 11 stone 9 pounds (163 pounds), one pound below the topweight Lord Windermere. Sherwood had wanted to wait until the following year to run the horse in the race but was over-ruled by Hemmings and Aspell. Starting at odds of 25/1, he was close behind the leaders for most of the way before taking the lead five fences from the finish when The Druid's Nephew fell. He went three lengths clear at the last and held on to win by one and three quarter lengths from the French-bred Saint Are, with Monbeg Dude six lengths back in third. The winning time of 8 minutes 56.8 seconds was the second fastest in the race's history. No horse had carried a higher weight to victory since Red Rum in 1974. He is also the first horse to win both the Hennessy Gold Cup and Grand National in the same season. The horse appeared somewhat distressed after crossing the line, and Aspell dismounted rather than riding the horse into the winner's enclosure, but he quickly recovered and was reported to be \\"bucking and kicking\\" in his paddock on the following morning. Aspell said, \\"I asked him some big questions and he has dug really deep. I tried to conserve energy because he had a hard race in the Gold Cup and it's a wonderful training performance by Oliver to freshen him up and recharge the batteries. He's all heart and he gave me the best ride I have ever had over these fences. I was just hoping that the battery life would last.\\" 2015–16 National Hunt season On his first appearance since his Aintree win, Many Clouds started the 9/2 third favourite for the Charlie Hall Chase at Wetherby but finished last of the six finishers behind Cue Card. At Aintree in December, he finished second to the Irish-trained Don Poli, to whom he was conceding five pounds. Many Clouds then attempted to repeat his 2015 success in the Cotswold Chase and finished second to Smad Place. His final prep race for the Grand National was intended to be a chase at Kelso Racecourse on 5 March but the meeting was abandoned and rearranged to take place eight days later. Starting the 11/10 favourite Many Clouds took the lead at the fourth fence and went on to win by ten lengths from Unioniste. Starting as 8/1 joint favourite, he finished in 16th place at the Grand National, behind winner Rule the World. 2016–17 National Hunt season In his first race since the Grand National, Many Clouds won on his return to Aintree in December, beating Le Mercurey by three and a half lengths. On 28 January 2017 Many Clouds attempted to repeat his 2015 success in the Cotswold Chase at Cheltenham and started at odds of 8/1 in a seven-runner field which included Thistlecrack (the 4/9 favourite), Smad Place, and Silviniaco Conti. After jumping well throughout the race, Many Clouds took the lead four fences from the finish and fought off the sustained challenge of Thistlecrack to win by a head in a photo-finish. After crossing the finish line Many Clouds collapsed and was pronounced dead by veterinary staff shortly afterwards. Oliver Sherwood commented, \\"I always said he'd die for you, and he has today, doing what he loved most. He wanted to win that race, by God he wanted to win it – he was beat at the last and he fought the last 50 yards to get up and win. I've trained for 32 years now and horses like that don't come along very often\\". A post-mortem examination revealed that he had died as a result of a \\"severe\\" exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage. The vets who carried out the post- mortem also concluded there were no underlying health issues and no connection with incidents where he was unsteady on his feet after previous races. In May 2017 the senior handicappers of Britain and Ireland named Many Clouds the leading staying steeplechaser of the 2016–17 season, rating him two pounds higher than Cheltenham Gold Cup winner Sizing John. ==PedigreeReferences * Career 1-2-3 Colour Chart – Many Clouds Category:2007 racehorse births Category:2017 racehorse deaths Category:Racehorses bred in Ireland Category:Racehorses trained in the United Kingdom Category:Grand National winners Category:Thoroughbred family 22 ","title":"Many Clouds"},{"id":"46381500","text":"Donna Eastwood (1988 – 18 October 2014) was a British woman stabbed to death by her neighbour, Joshua Caird, in Dartford, Kent, England, in 2014. The 26-year-old's body was found in a burnt out car, Caird stole from his sister in Rowhill Road in the nearby village of Wilmington. She was found with several stab wounds to the back. ==Life== Eastwood was a mother of four children. ==Murder== The night of her murder, Eastwood was at a birthday party held by her murderer's sister. After the party took place, Eastwood went back to her house. This was the last time she was seen alive. After the party took place, Caird was found drunk and passed out by his parents. His parents then lifted him up and carried him to his house, which was just a few doors down from his sister's house. His parents then helped him to his bedroom, where he slumped on his bed. A few hours after falling asleep, Caird then walked to Eastwood's house. Once he arrived at her house, she opened the door and he then proceeded to stab her in the back multiple times. He then wrapped the mother of four children in tarpaulin and drove off in his sister's car. He drove to his brother's house in Dartford, where he asked for his assistance in burying her body. His brother agreed to it, but Caird punched his brother several times, knocking him out. After knocking his brother out, Caird then drove to the nearby village of Wilmington. Once he arrived there, he doused the car in gasoline and set the car alight. Firefighters were called to the scene of the burning car at 6:20am. Once they put out the flames, a fireman discovered Eastwood's body in the back of the car. The fireman then called the police to tell them of his discovery. ==Arrest of Caird== On 19 October, the day after Eastwood's death, Caird was arrested in the attic in his house on suspicion of murdering Eastwood. He was taken to a nearby police station where he was being interviewed by police about the death of Eastwood. He was silent throughout the majority of the interrogation. On 20 October, Caird was brought to Maidstone Crown Court where he was charged with one count of murder. He was remanded in custody until his trial on 10 April 2015. ==Trial== Caird appeared at Maidstone Crown Court on 10 April 2015 accused of murdering Eastwood. During his trial, Nigel Pilkington said that there was \\"overwhelming evidence\\" against Caird. In his trial, Caird admitted that he brutally murdered Eastwood. At the end of his trial, Caird was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for 25 years. Eastwood's sister, Lisa Sheppard, said after Caird's trial, \\"I am glad that this nightmare is now over and that justice has been served. Life no doubt will still be hard but to know that Donna's killer is locked up is of some comfort.\\" ==References== Category:2014 in England Category:2014 murders in the United Kingdom Category:2010s in Kent Category:2010s trials Category:Borough of Dartford Category:Murder in Kent Category:Murder trials Category:Trials in England Category:Female murder victims ","title":"Murder of Donna Eastwood"},{"id":"46381535","text":"Turbolidium is a genus of sea snails, marine gastropod mollusks in the family Pyramidellidae, the pyrams and their allies.Bouchet, P.

All 57 seats in the City Council were up for election. The election was held simultaneously with regional elections in thirteen autonomous communities and local elections all throughout Spain. Alberto Ruiz-Gallardón's People's Party (PP) went on to win the largest victory achieved by a candidate in a municipal election in Madrid to date, with over 55% of the votes and nearly 60% of the seats. The Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) plummeted barely above 1995 levels, while United Left (IU) recovered from its negative result in 2003 and gained support for the first time since 1995. ==Electoral system== The City Council of Madrid () was the top-tier administrative and governing body of the municipality of Madrid, composed of the mayor, the government council and the elected plenary assembly. Elections to the local councils in Spain were fixed for the fourth Sunday of May every four years. Voting for the local assembly was on the basis of universal suffrage, which comprised all nationals over eighteen, registered in the municipality of Madrid and in full enjoyment of their political rights, as well as resident non-national European citizens and those whose country of origin allowed Spanish nationals to vote in their own elections by virtue of a treaty. Local councillors were elected using the D'Hondt method and a closed list proportional representation, with a threshold of five percent of valid votes—which included blank ballots—being applied in each local council. Parties not reaching the threshold were not taken into consideration for seat distribution. Councillors were allocated to municipal councils based on the following scale: {  left; font-size:95%;\\" - bgcolor=\\"#E9E9E9\\" align=\\"center\\" ! width=\\"120\\" Population ! width=\\"265\\" Councillors -  <250  5 -  251–1,000  7 -  1,001–2,000  9 -  2,001–5,000  11 -  5,001–10,000  13 -  10,001–20,000  17 -  20,001–50,000  21 -  50,001–100,000  25 -  >100,001  +1 per each 100,000 inhabitants or fraction +1 if total is an even number } The mayor was indirectly elected by the plenary assembly. A legal clause required that mayoral candidates earned the vote of an absolute majority of councillors, or else the candidate of the most-voted party in the assembly was to be automatically appointed to the post. In the event of a tie, a toss-up would determine the appointee. The electoral law allowed for parties and federations registered in the interior ministry, coalitions and groupings of electors to present lists of candidates. Parties and federations intending to form a coalition ahead of an election were required to inform the relevant Electoral Commission within ten days of the election call, whereas groupings of electors needed to secure the signature of a determined amount of the electors registered in the municipality for which they were seeking election, disallowing electors from signing for more than one list of candidates. For the case of Madrid, as its population was over 1,000,001, at least 8,000 signatures were required. ==Opinion polls== The table below lists voting intention estimates in reverse chronological order, showing the most recent first and using the dates when the survey fieldwork was done, as opposed to the date of publication.

In 2011, it was temporarily taken down during the construction of an underground railway station and sent to restorers. However, when it was about to be reinstalled, a minority of Praga's residents objected, as they perceived the monument as a remnant of the Communist era. In surveys carried out by the city council and Gazeta Wyborcza in 2012 and 2013 respectively, the majority of Warsaw's residents said they would like the monument to be returned to its original place or placed somewhere nearby. In 2015, the Warsaw City Council overturned its earlier decision to return the monument and made the removal permanent. The monument was colloquially known as \\"the four sleepers or \\"the four mourners\\" (pomnik „czterech śpiących”, „czterech smutnych”), in reference to the figures of two Polish and two Soviet soldiers with bowed heads at the four corners of the monument. ==References== Category:Monuments and memorials in Warsaw Category:World War II monuments and memorials in Poland Category:1945 sculptures Category:Soviet military memorials and cemeteries Category:Poland–Soviet Union relations ","title":"Monument to Brotherhood in Arms"},{"id":"46381666","text":"The 2015–16 season is Fenerbahçe's 58th consecutive season in the Süper Lig and their 108th year in existence. ==Season overview== * On 10 April 2015, Dirk Kuyt has signed to Feyenoord to play next year since his contract expired on 31 May 2015. * On 11 June 2015, Fenerbahçe have released a statement on their official website confirming that Portuguese manager Vítor Pereira has been appointed manager on a two-year deal. * On 17 June 2015, Centre back Simon Kjær signed a four-year contract with Fenerbahçe from Lille for a €7.65 million fee. * On 22 June 2015, Mert Günok has signed a three-year contract with Bursaspor after his contract expired on 31 May 2015. * On 23 June 2015, Fenerbahçe officially signed a four-year contract with Bursaspor former right back Şener Özbayraklı for ₺5.0 million. * On 25 June 2015, Fenerbahçe have completed the signing of Atlético Paranaense striker Fernandão on a four-year deal the club revealed. * On 27 June 2015, Fenerbahçe part ways with Emre Belözoğlu.

The current winner is Marshall, who won, 59–28, on November 29, 2013. East Carolina leads the all-time series, 10–5. ==History== East Carolina and Marshall have a \\"friendly\\" rivalry with one another. They are emotionally bonded by the tragic plane crash on November 14, 1970. The Thundering Herd were coming back from Greenville, North Carolina after a 17–14 loss to the Pirates when their plane crashed near Ceredo, West Virginia. East Carolina joined Conference USA (C-USA) in 1997 as an affiliate member for football only until the 2001 season as the school moved up to full membership. When three teams from the Big East Conference moved to the ACC, the Big East looked for new members for their conference and invited five schools from C-USA to join their conference. Then C-USA added six other teams, including Marshall from the Mid-American Conference. The six new teams brought C-USA to twelve teams in which the conference can split into divisions and host a Conference USA Football Championship Game. East Carolina and Marshall were placed in the \\"East\\" division and played annually since then. East Carolina and Marshall's most memorable games was the 2001 GMAC Bowl as they combined for a bowl record, 125 points, as Marshall overcame a 30-point deficit to beat East Carolina 64–61 in double overtime. With East Carolina's move to the American Athletic Conference in 2014, the annual meeting with Marshall that had taken place since 2005 was discontinued. On April 3, 2014, both schools announced that the two teams will meet again for a home and home series in 2020 and 2021. East Carolina will host Marshall at Dowdy–Ficklen Stadium on September 5, 2020. Marshall will host the second game of the series at Joan C. Edwards Stadium on September 11, 2021.

Stefan Rinke (born December 31, 1965) is a German historian and specialist in Latin American history. Since 2005 he has been Professor at the Institute of Latin American Studies and at the Friedrich-Meinecke-Institut at Freie Universität Berlin. == Biography == After graduating from the Gymnasium Julianum in Helmstedt in 1984, Stefan Rinke studied History and American Studies in Bamberg and Bowling Green (Ohio) from 1985 to 1990. He completed his studies in 1989 with a Master of Arts in Bowling Green and in 1990 with a diploma in history in Bamberg.André Felipe Cândido da Silva, Miriam Junghans, Juliana Manzoni Cavalcanti, Pedro Felipe Neves de Muñoz: Trocas intelectuais entre Alemanha e América Latina: entrevista com Stefan Rinke, in: História, Ciencias, Saude-Manguinhos vol. 21 no.1 Rio de Janeiro Jan./Mar. 2014, Retrieved April 10, 2015. The Friedrich- Ebert-Stiftung supported him with a doctoral scholarship from 1991 to 1993. In 1995 he received his doctorate at the Catholic University of Eichstätt with a thesis on German-Latin American relations during the Weimar Republic from a transnational perspective. His advisor was Hans-Joachim König. The work appeared in 1996 as the first volume in the series Historamericana, which was founded by König and Rinke.Stefan Rinke: \\"Der letzte freie Kontinent\\": Deutsche Lateinamerikapolitik im Zeichen transnationaler Beziehungen, 1918-1933 [\\"The Last Free Continent“: German Latin American Relations in Transnational Perspective], (Stuttgart: Heinz, 1996).

His research focuses on cultural globalization and North Americanization, popular culture, revolutions, memory and historical consciousness, history of knowledge, trans-American relations, temporality and future. They cover the period from colonial times (Columbus, Conquista of Mexico, identities), the independence period (Atlantic revolutions, thinking about the future), the 19th century (state-building and dictatorships, USA and Latin America), the 20th century (World War I, football, aviation, experts) to contemporary history (memory and conflict in Columbia and Chile, Colonia Dignidad). == International activities == Stefan Rinke has been Visiting Professor and Research Fellow at leading international universities, including El Colegio de México and Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile. From 2009 to 2018, he was spokesperson of the first German-Latin American Research Training Group (IGK 1531 \\"Between Spaces - Entre Espacios\\"), a cooperation with Mexican partners dedicated to interdisciplinary research on globalization in history and the present.

He has variations such as the googly, the quicker ball, the carrom ball as well as the off break which he bowls without changing the grip. ==Career== Cariappa started playing cricket at the age of 17 as fast bowling all-rounder, but later switched to spin bowling. In 2014, Cariappa played for the Karnataka Under-19 team and Bijapur Bulls in the Karnataka Premier League (KPL). He finished as the third-highest wicket-taker at the KPL and grabbed the attention of a few IPL scouts during the tournament. He was included in Karnataka's 30-man probable squad for Ranji Trophy, but was not selected in the final squad. In September 2014, he was asked to bowl in the trials for Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) during a training camp in Hyderabad before the start of 2014 Champions League Twenty20. The captain of KKR, Gautam Gambhir failed to read his bowling during the trials, and the team management asked Cariappa to sign-up for the 2015 IPL auction. In February 2015, Cariappa was bought by KKR at the IPL auction for , an unusually huge amount as Cariappa had not played any form of top-level cricket before he was signed-up by the Knight Riders. The Managing Director and CEO of Kolkata Knight Riders, Venky Mysore responded after the auction, \\"Some of the top players that we have including the legendary Kallis found him (Cariappa) to be very unusual and extremely good, and we decided to give him a shot.\\" He made his senior cricket debut during the 2015 IPL for the Knight Riders against the Royal Challengers Bangalore on 11 April 2015 and picked up the wicket of AB de Villiers. This was the only time he played for them that season. He was released from their squad the very next season. At the next auction, he was picked up by Kings XI Punjab for a lower price of . In 2019, he returned to Kolkata Knight Riders as a replacement when Shivam Mavi got injured. He was released by the Kolkata Knight Riders ahead of the 2020 IPL auction. ==References * Category:Living people Category:1994 births Category:Indian cricketers Category:Kolkata Knight Riders cricketers Category:Cricketers from Bangalore Category:Kings XI Punjab cricketers ","title":"K.

All 57 seats in the City Council were up for election. The election was held simultaneously with regional elections in thirteen autonomous communities and local elections all throughout Spain. The People's Party (PP) won its 6th consecutive absolute majority of seats in the City Council, albeit with a diminished voter base, suffering its worst loss of support in the city up until that time (120,000 votes, 6 percentage points and 3 seats were lost from 2007). Only the collapse of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) vote, which obtained the worst result of its history as a result of the criticised José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero's premiership in the national government, was larger. United Left (IU) benefitted from the PSOE debacle, while newly founded Union, Progress and Democracy (UPyD) attracted votes from sectors disenchanted with both PSOE and PP and entered the City Council in the first election in which they stood. Alberto Ruiz-Gallardón, who was re-elected for a third term in office, left the mayoralty in late 2011 to become Justice Minister, after his party won the 2011 Spanish general election and Mariano Rajoy was elected Prime Minister. He was succeeded as mayor by Ana Botella. ==Electoral system== The City Council of Madrid () was the top-tier administrative and governing body of the municipality of Madrid, composed of the mayor, the government council and the elected plenary assembly. Elections to the local councils in Spain were fixed for the fourth Sunday of May every four years. Voting for the local assembly was on the basis of universal suffrage, which comprised all nationals over eighteen, registered and residing in the municipality of Madrid and in full enjoyment of their political rights, as well as resident non-national European citizens and those whose country of origin allowed Spanish nationals to vote in their own elections by virtue of a treaty. Local councillors were elected using the D'Hondt method and a closed list proportional representation, with a threshold of five percent of valid votes—which included blank ballots—being applied in each local council. Parties not reaching the threshold were not taken into consideration for seat distribution. Councillors were allocated to municipal councils based on the following scale: {  left; font-size:95%;\\" - bgcolor=\\"#E9E9E9\\" align=\\"center\\" ! width=\\"120\\" Population ! width=\\"265\\" Councillors -  <100  3 -  101–250  5 -  251–1,000  7 -  1,001–2,000  9 -  2,001–5,000  11 -  5,001–10,000  13 -  10,001–20,000  17 -  20,001–50,000  21 -  50,001–100,000  25 -  >100,001  +1 per each 100,000 inhabitants or fraction +1 if total is an even number } The mayor was indirectly elected by the plenary assembly. A legal clause required that mayoral candidates earned the vote of an absolute majority of councillors, or else the candidate of the most-voted party in the assembly was to be automatically appointed to the post. In the event of a tie, a toss-up would determine the appointee. The electoral law allowed for parties and federations registered in the interior ministry, coalitions and groupings of electors to present lists of candidates. Parties and federations intending to form a coalition ahead of an election were required to inform the relevant Electoral Commission within ten days of the election call, whereas groupings of electors needed to secure the signature of a determined amount of the electors registered in the municipality for which they were seeking election, disallowing electors from signing for more than one list of candidates. For the case of Madrid, as its population was over 1,000,001, at least 8,000 signatures were required. ==Opinion polls== The table below lists voting intention estimates in reverse chronological order, showing the most recent first and using the dates when the survey fieldwork was done, as opposed to the date of publication. Where the fieldwork dates are unknown, the date of publication is given instead. The highest percentage figure in each polling survey is displayed with its background shaded in the leading party's colour. If a tie ensues, this is applied to the figures with the highest percentages. The \\"Lead\\" column on the right shows the percentage-point difference between the parties with the highest percentages in a given poll. When available, seat projections are also displayed below the voting estimates in a smaller font. 29 seats were required for an absolute majority in the City Council of Madrid. ; { class=\\" collapsible collapsed\\" center; font-size:95%; line- height:16px;\\" - style=\\"height:42px; background-color:#E9E9E9\\" !

She grew up in Norwich and Uncasville, Connecticut. ==Early life and education== Sayet was brought up on stories and traditions of the Mohegan tribe from her great-aunt Gladys Tantaquidgeon, former Medicine Woman, and her mother Melissa Tantaquidgeon Zobel, current Medicine Woman. Sayet also holds ancestral ties to Fidelia Fielding who was the last fluent speaker of the Mohegan language, and died in 1908. These ties serve as an influence for much of her work. From a young age, oral traditions and storytelling all played a major role in her work. In high school, Sayet took part at the Eugene O'Neill Theatre Center's National Puppetry Conference. Post graduation, she went on to study under the Atlantic Theater Company at New York University as part of the Tisch School of the Arts. After receiving her BFA in Theater, she continued her studies as part of the graduate program, where she received her MA in Arts Politics and Post-Colonial Theory, at NYU's Gallatin School of Individualized Study. During this time she co-founded and directed the Mad & Merry Theatre Company. Sayet adapted classical pieces to incorporate her own culture. She also has an MA in Shakespeare from The Shakespeare Institute in Stratford Upon Avon, UK. ==Career== Madeline Sayet is currently the Executive Director of the Yale Indigenous Performing Arts Program. In 2018, she was named a Forbes 30 Under 30 in Hollywood & Entertainment for her work as a stage director, reimagining the classics. Early in Sayet's directing and writing career, she remade the Shakespeare classic \\"The Tempest\\" by incorporating Mohegan language and culture. This production served as her graduate thesis at New York University and was brought onstage at the Brooklyn Lyceum. While at NYU, Sayet launched The Mad and Merry Theatre Company, which completed three successful seasons of programming dedicated to reimagining classic stories before disbanding. During this time Sayet furthered her career when she wrote \\"Daughters of Leda,\\" a play that chronicles the stories of well-known mythological characters such as: Leda and The Swan, Adam and Eve, Helen, Clytemnestra, Iphigenia, and Electra from the female perspective. The production was part of the Women Center Stage Festival, the Dream Up Festival, and Dixon Place's Works-In-Progress. She is the recipient of the White House Champion of Change Award for Native America for her work as a director, writer, performer and educator. In 2015 Sayet made her opera debut when she directed a new production of The Magic Flute for the Glimmerglass Opera,. In 2015 she also launched the Native Shakespeare Ensemble at Amerinda (American Indian Artists) Inc. with productions of Macbeth and The WInter's Tale. Sayet also directed \\"Sliver of a Full Moon\\" which is a play about the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) that pays tribute to the re-authorization that occurred in 2013. It aims to get the audience to see Native women that were affected by violence to be seen as human beings rather than symbols. Because culture is such a big part of her work, she learned that in Mohegan, her job is called \\"Kutayun Uyasunaquock\\" which means \\"Our Heart She Leads Us There.\\" She is currently a TED Fellow, MIT Media Lab Director's Fellow, and National Directing Fellow. She served as the Resident Artistic Director at Amerinda, Inc, from 2013 to 2016, the Artistic Director of the Mad & Merry Theatre Company from 2011 to 2014, and has been a Van Lier Directing Fellow at Second Stage Theatre, and a Creative Community Fellow at National Arts Strategies'.

Elemaga is located in the center of Inyila, Isiala-Ibere, Ahia Orie, Iberenta, Inyilu, Itunta and Oburo the food belt of Ibere, about 15 km southwest of Umuahia, the Abia state capital. Elemaga is believed to be derived syntactically from the words Ele (\\"look\\"), Ma (\\"well\\") and Ga (\\"go\\") which literally means \\"look well before you go\\". In contrast with what has believed a century ago, there is no evidence of a special pre-Christian significance in the small farming village of Elemaga Ibere. The fourth-smallest village among 14 villages in the Ibere community is richly surrounded with numerous cultural displays. There are farmers, hunters and chiefs as well as engineers, lawyers, bankers, lecturers and business merchants. The 3,000 inhabitants work in cocoa plantations and palm oil plantations which is the major sources of income for their livelihood. They accommodate many labourers from neighbouring villages like Nkalu in Akwa Ibom, Enugu, Ebonyi. Their farm products are sold in Ahia Orie, Ahia Ndoro, Ahia Ariam and Ahia Ugwumaberi ibeku known as Umuahia modern-market. Elemaga has rich cultural heritage some of which are itu igwu, ekpe, oboni, okonko and many others. The community observes rest from its farming activities on nkwo market day. It is part of the Agbo Ibere autonomous community which it doubles as the capital. what could be referred to as one of the oldest primary schools in the entire Ibere clan is situated in Elemaga Ibere. ==History== The history of Elemaga is still sketchy in general view of the Ibere community, where some argue that their ancestors moved downward from Jewish tribes of Israel who vacated Egypt during the mass movement of Pharaoh era before the colonial period. Others contend that the ancestors may have migrated with Olokoro/Ibeku in Umuahia during the stone era. Elemaga people share sociocultural similarities with their neighbouring villages, such as Ekpe festival, New yam festival, Obono dance, Ekpo masquerade, Okumoko dance and ubochi owu (resting market day). Nkwoahia (market days) is regularly observed as a resting day for Elemaga people. Major ceremonies such as marriage, burial, and dances bear striking resemblances among her relatives in a diaspora. The language of Elemaga Ibere is typical Igbo language with a sharp difference. Elemaga is composed of Uno-mara ano (four kindreds), namely Umunyiaokwo, Ngboko, Nlialanyi and Agbo-Miri(there are some other kinsmen in Bende Local Government Area of Abia). However, development and urbanisation are rapidly coming to Elemaga. The provision of electricity and the Elemaga–Ibere road were traced back to Orji Uzor Kalu the former governor of Abia. Tensions escalated in Elemaga, Itunta, Oburo and her neighbouring villages on Elemaga erosion sites and the famous bridge that links to the rich farming villages of Itunta, Oburo and Nkalunta. The economic road is the shortest way of transporting their agricultural produce. Elemaga people seek the attention of Abia State Government of Nigeria and International community for its urgency. ==Government== Elemaga people receive day-to-day government authority at a local level in Ama-ala (the village assembly), through the help of the town crier (PRO). The village assembly is made up of Onyeisi (the chief or village leader), the elders, men, women and youths. Since century back, Elemaga has maintained an Ama ogwu (village square) with the Agbala (sacred courtroom) at its centre. Agbala is an ancient special jurisdiction. The term Agbala is used interchangeably to refer to village judiciary courtroom headed by Nna-Ezi (the oldest man). ==Culture== The burial of an Elemaga man or woman is the responsibility of the deceased family and of the village. Umunna (the first male son in the family) and Umuada (the first daughter of the family) play an important role for the peaceful atmosphere of the village, by settling communal and family dispute such as farmland disputant, economic use of trees, sand and communal land. ==References== Category:Populated places in Abia State ","title":"Elemaga"},{"id":"46381949","text":"Troy Dorchester (born August 21, 1970) is a Canadian professional chuckwagon racer.

As the 1690s proceeded, he became identified with the Country Party opposition. ==Family== On 9 June 1683 Dashwood married Penelope, daughter of Sir Thomas Chamberlayne, 2nd Baronet. They had five sons and four daughters. Their eldest son surviving to adulthood was Robert, who married Dorothea Read(e).

Their daughter Penelope married Sir John Stonhouse, 3rd Baronet, Member of Parliament for . The third daughter Catherine married Sir Robert Bankes Jenkinson, 4th Baronet. The other daughters were Margaret (who died young), and Anne who married Anthony Cope (he was son of Jonathan Cope and brother of Sir Jonathan Cope, 1st Baronet, both MPs). Robert the son died in 1728, in Paris, before his father.

He was author of several internationally recognised books in his field. ==Early life== Berry was born on 30 May 1867, in Upholland in Lancashire, the son of Jane Barlow and James Berry, a coal-merchant. His father died before he was born, and he was largely raised by his grandfather. He was educated at small private schools in Southport, beginning at Dame’s School and then in 1877 going onto a private school for boys before winning a place at the University of Cambridge. However, he did not take up his place at the university, instead taking an apprenticeship with a firm of shipbrokers in Liverpool. After some time Berry was granted permission to terminate his contract. In May 1886 he entered the University of Edinburgh to study medicine, graduating with an MBChM in 1891. Berry then took up a role of House Surgeon under Thomas Annandale, Regius professor of clinical surgery at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary on Lauriston Place. In the same year Berry was elected President of the Royal Medical Society of Edinburgh. The following year Berry was appointed lecturer in anatomy at the school of medicine of the Royal Colleges. On receipt of his MD in 1894 he had written a prize-winning thesis on the Vermiform appendix. Berry was held in very high regard within the institution and was a greatly respected and well established academic. In 1895 Berry was elected a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh and the following year began to lecture in anatomy at the University of Edinburgh. In 1897 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. ==Professor of anatomy== In December 1905 Berry was accepted for a role as Professor of Anatomy at Melbourne University and travelled over with his wife in February 1906 to replace Sir Harry Brookes Allen in his role of Head of Anatomy. The style of teaching was revolutionised by Berry. He taught until 1929. He also served as Honorary Psychiatrist at Melbourne Children’s Hospital. After settling into his new role he became interested in studies of the skulls of the Aboriginals. His collection of skulls and bones was rediscovered in 2003. From this he developed a further interest in the skulls of mentally deficient children. From here he became a consultant psychiatrist to the Royal Melbourne Children’s Hospital in Parkville, close to the University of Melbourne. He was a proponent of eugenics, supporting the killing of \\"the grosser types of our mental defectives\\". In 1923 a new Anatomy Department was opened at Melbourne University, and was nicknamed ‘’Berry’s Folly’’’ on account of what was thought to be its over-size, but this proved to be prudent foresight once class sizes swelled after the Second World War. From 1925 to 1929 Berry was the Dean of the Faculty. He strongly advocated a closer physical relationship between the university and the hospital. However this met with opposition from Sir James Barrett. However, in 1927 he toured hospitals of North America with Sir Stanley Argyle the Premier of Victoria, and this ultimately led to the plan being adopted. In 1929 Berry resigned and began his appointment as director of medical services at the Stoke Park Colony, Stapleton in England. ==Later life== In 1929 Berry unexpectedly resigned and returned to Britain to take up the role as Head of Medical Services at Stoke Park Mental Hospital near Bristol in England. He also then took chairmanship of the Burden Mental Research Trust. He represented Queensland and New South Wales in his membership of the council of the British Medical Association. He continued studies into mental deficiency until 1940. In 1959, Sir William Upjohn persuaded Melbourne University to grant Berry the title of Professor emeritus, and Berry, by then virtually blind, returned to receive this honour. Berry died on 30 September 1962 at Clifton, Bristol. == Controversy == Berry was strongly associated with and a vocal supporter of the eugenics movement in Melbourne. He conducted craniometric analysis on the skulls of Aboriginal Australians and people with disabilities with a view towards establishing a relationship between cranium size and intelligence. It was Berry’s intentions to showcase the comparative superiority of certain individuals and of the 'white' race more generally. Berry’s research involved the collection of Aboriginal ancestral remains. His collection is known as the ‘Berry collection and consisted of 400 Aboriginal remains, many of which were taken from traditional graves without consent from traditional custodians. These remains were only rediscovered and made public knowledge in 2003. In 1906 The Bulletin published a letter protesting at any ‘breathing of regret’ that the Aboriginal population was dying out (Cawte 1986, p. 44), the article queried whether it ‘isn’t it a desirable thing that the inferior races should die out … There isn’t so much spare room on this earth for even the best races…’. Macdonald states that it is widely believed that Berry left Melbourne because he had made “powerful enemies” (Macdonald 2017, p. 5). Thereafter his work was carried out in Stoke Park as chairman of the Burden Mental Research Trust where he conducted research regarding ‘the problems underlying the cause and inheritance of normal and abnormal mentality’. In March 2017 a group of staff and students from the University of Melbourne led a successful anti-racism campaign to rename the Richard Berry Building for Mathematics and Statistics. As a consequence of this campaign, the University of Melbourne Mathematics & Statistics building was re-named in honour of the “worthy University of Melbourne alumni and great scholar” Peter Gavin Hall. Campaigner's claim that this represented a positive step towards reconciliation and that it is in accordance with the university’s Reconciliation Action Plan which seeks to achieve appropriate recognition of the contributions of Indigenous Australians. ==Family== On 7 August 1900 Berry married Beatrice Catherine Brighouse (d.1949), daughter of Sir Samuel Brighouse, whom he had met through his hobby of cycling and mountain climbing. His daughter Beatrice married Professor Ian Maxwell of Melbourne. ==Memorials== Berry's portrait, by Justus Jorgensen, hangs in the Anatomy Department of Melbourne University. The building housing the anatomy department at Melbourne University was named the Richard Berry Building in his honour. The building was later used by the Melbourne's mathematics department. Following protests centered around Berry's racist and eugenicist views, the name of the building was changed in March 2017 to instead honour recently deceased mathematician Peter Hall. ==Publications== *Transactions of the Royal Society of Victoria: ‘’On the Tasmanian crania’’ (1909) *’’A Clinical Atlas of Sectional and Topographical Anatomy’’ (1911) *Transactions of the Royal Society of Victoria: ‘’On the Australian crania’’ (1914) *’’Practical Anatomy’’ (1914) *’’Brain and Mind’’ (1928) *Report on mental deficiency in Victoria (1929) *’’A Cerebral Atlas of Normal and Defective Brains’’ (1938) *’’Your Brain and Its Story’’ (1939) ==References== 5\\\\.

The park surrounds a 45-acre lake that was once a mill pond and source of water for a sawmill which operated from 1902 to 1920. Ratcliff Lake Recreation Area was built in 1936 by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) and is operated by the United States Forest Service (USFS). The facility is open year-round and includes a large campground, picnic areas, an amphitheater, a swim area and hiking trails. ==History== In the late 19th century, pioneer settler J. H. Ratcliff operated a small sawmill in the virgin forests of East Texas. In 1899, the Central Coal and Coke Company of Kansas City, Missouri began buying land in the area along with the small sawmill. Central Coal and Coke eventually owned 120,000 acres of timberland. The company used Ratcliff's sawmill to produce materials to build the much larger \\"Four C Mill.\\" By June 1902, the fourteen acre mill complex produced 350,000 board feet of lumber per day. By 1917, the company had cut all the larger old growth trees available. The company harvested the smaller trees between 1917 and 1920, but that could not keep the mill profitable and it ceased operation.Eliza H. Bishop, \\"RATCLIFF, TX (HOUSTON COUNTY),\\" Handbook of Texas Online, accessed April 10, 2015. Uploaded on June 15, 2010. Published by the Texas State Historical Association. In October 1934, Civilian Conservation Corps Company 1803 set up camp in the area for project number F-4 to build Davy Crockett National Forest and Ratcliff Lake Recreation Area. The CCC built an earthen dam to turn the old sawmill pond into 45-acre Ratcliff Lake. They also built roads, a bath house and planted an estimated 3,000,000 trees to re-establish the forest. Ratcliff Lake Recreation Area was closed in September 2008 due to damage from Hurricane Ike. After re- opening in 2010, damage caused by a tornado and then severe drought caused the park to close again between April 2011 and September 2012. ==Flora and fauna== The area is heavily forested with loblolly pine, oak and other hardwoods.

This was because he mined crystals from the Great Guardian Tree, and taking the magic from the forest. Then, Cronan turned on Rosalyn, and mind controlled the animals against her. Rosalyn calls on her dragon, Sapphire, and Ashwing, but Cronan defeats them, and takes Ashwing as his own dragon. Back at the sanctuary, Naida refuses to believe that Cronan is evil. Emily tells her that there are 2 sides to every story. The next morning, Naida has disappeared. The elves search for her and try to restore the forest. They rescue a kitten from the goblins, but when it sees Emily's amulet, it turns into a bear and lunges for it. Farran traps it in leaves, but it escapes and chases them. They barricade themselves in Rosalyn's sanctuary. Meanwhile, Naida goes looking for the Goblin King. She arrives at his castle. The goblins let her in to see the king. Ashwing lunges at her, but the dragon is secured by a chain. However, Naida is stunned by its appearance. She goes to the roof to see Cronan. As soon as she arrives, the door is locked and Cronan says he \\"has big plans\\" for her. He tells Naida about his side of the story. His mother was one of the Five Sisters. She tried to open the portal to Earth, but the magic was too powerful. Cronan swears he'll bring her back. ==Characters== Humans * Emily Jones (voiced by Ashleigh Ball): The protagonist, a resourceful, modest, amicable, and affectionate human girl, whose \\"element\\" is \\"love\\".

Some critics use the label to refer only to non- supernatural horror stories, especially those that have nasty climactic twists, but it is applicable to any story whose conclusion exploits the cruel aspects of the 'irony of fate.' The collection from which the short-story genre of the conte cruel takes its name is Contes cruels (1883, tr. Sardonic Tales, 1927) by Villiers de l'Isle-Adam. Also taking its name from this collection is Contes cruels (\\"Cruel Tales\\"), a two-volume set of about 150 tales and short stories by the 19th-century French writer Octave Mirbeau, collected and edited by Pierre Michel and Jean-François Nivet and published in two volumes in 1990 by Librairie Séguier. Some noted writers in the conte cruel genre are Charles Birkin, Maurice Level, Patricia HighsmithFrançois Riviere, \\"Patricia Highsmith a rejoint les eaux profondes\\" Libération, 6 February 1995. Retrieved 13 January 2018. and Roald Dahl, the latter of whom originated Tales of the Unexpected. H. P. Lovecraft observed of Level's fiction in his essay Supernatural Horror in Literature (1927): \\"This type, however, is less a part of the weird tradition than a class peculiar to itself—the so-called conte cruel, in which the wrenching of the emotions is accomplished through dramatic tantalizations, frustrations, and gruesome physical horrors\\". Brian M. Stableford has observed that, by the 1980s, the conte cruel was the standard narrative form of soft science fiction, in particular the works of Thomas M. Disch and John Sladek. ==See also== *Conte (literature) * Anthology * Drabble * Flash fiction (also called microfiction) * Irish short story * Literary journal * Minisaga * Sketch story * Tall tale * Vignette ==References== Category:Fiction forms Category:Literature Category:Short story types ","title":"Conte cruel"},{"id":"46382082","text":"The 2015 New Zealand Open Grand Prix Gold was the sixth grand prix gold and grand prix tournament of the 2015 BWF Grand Prix and Grand Prix Gold.

It was designed by architect Charles Christian Hook and built between 1901 and 1903 by the Lazenby Brothers, for British mining engineer Egbert Hambley and his family. It is a large 2 1/2-story, granite and brick, Châteauesque style mansion with a tall hipped slate roof. It features an offset, conical-roof tower, two-story projecting bay, and wraparound arcaded porch. Other contributing resources are the playhouse (c. 1915-1920), a stable / servant's quarters (c. 1903-1904), and the landscaped grounds (c. 1904–present). Historian Davyd Foard Hood said the decision to use Châteauesque architecture was the result of the recent completion of Biltmore House. Thomas Meehan & Sons of Philadelphia did additional work on the property in 1904. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. It is located in the Salisbury Historic District. Lottie Hambley sold the house to John David and Mary Napoleon Norwood in 1917. The Norwoods eventually had financial problems and, although Mary Norwood was able to buy the house at auction in 1923, she defaulted on the mortgage. Leo Wallace Jr. and Virginia Wallace bought the house for $55,500 at auction in 1927. Members of the Wallace family have lived in the house since then. Leo and Virginia Wallace lived in the house for 70 years. Virginia Wallace loved roses, and it happened that the original deed required that a rose garden would always be included on the property. Leo's son Lee and his wife Mona Lisa Wallace bought the house in 2011 and restored it. ==References== Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in North Carolina Category:Châteauesque architecture in the United States Category:Houses completed in 1903 Category:Houses in Salisbury, North Carolina Category:National Register of Historic Places in Rowan County, North Carolina Category:Historic district contributing properties in North Carolina ","title":"Hambley–Wallace House"},{"id":"46382112","text":"Sandra (born February 14, 1986, in Rostock Zoo in East Germany) is an orangutan, currently living in the Center for Great Apes in Florida after being moved from the Buenos Aires Zoo in 2019. Sandra is a zoo-born, hybrid orangutan of the two separate species of Borneo and Sumatra orangutans. In Germany, Sandra, then called Marisa, was transferred to a second zoo in Germany, then transferred to Argentina on September 17, 1994. In the Buenos Aires Zoo the name of the orangutan was changed to Sandra. Sandra had a baby girl called Shembira or Gembira, who was born on March 2, 1999, and was transferred to Xixiakou Wild Animal Park, Rongcheng, Sandong, China in 2008. During the amparo court case in Buenos Aires in 2015, it was revealed that an attempt by the Buenos Aires zoo to mate Sandra with an orangutan named Max failed because Sandra preferred instead to sit outside in the rain and snow. == Legal status determinations == On December 18, 2014, Sandra was termed by the court in Argentina as a \\"subject of rights\\" in an unsuccessful habeas corpus case regarding the release of the orangutan from captivity at the Buenos Aires zoo. The decision turning down the habeas corpus application also led to the court's direction to prosecute alleged cruelty by the zoo through the prosecutor's office in Buenos Aires in 2015. The brief \\"subject of rights\\" statement left the status of the orangutan Sandra as a \\"non-human being\\" uncertain legally, until on October 21, 2015, Justice Elena Amanda Liberatori ruled in an amparo case with Sandra that the orangutan is \\"una persona no humana\\" or \\"a non-human person\\" and ordered the city of Buenos Aires to provide what is \\"necessary to preserve her cognitive abilities\\". A few days after the decision, both sides said they would appeal. Initially, it was reported widely in the media that Sandra was declared a \\"non-human person\\" by the court on December 18, 2014, but that was a legal interpretation by the association of lawyers for animal rights in Argentina, ALFADA, that was pursuing court cases on behalf of Sandra, and was not explicitly in the wording of the court statement, until Justice Liberatori interpreted the previous ruling in her decision. The judge said in her ruling that Sandra still would not have personhood rights like a human being.Shawn Thompson, “Supporting Ape Rights: Finding the Right Fit Between Science and the Law.” ASEBL Journal January 2019 Volume 14, Issue 1 https://www.sfc.edu/uploaded/documents/publications/ASEBLv14n1Jan19.pdf That decision that Sandra was a non-human person was reversed a year later by the appellate court of Buenos Aires.decision of the appellate court of Buenos Aires In most legal jurisdictions in the world, a non-human animal is considered an object without rights, or property capable of being owned, bought, and sold, not a subject with rights. In most jurisdictions, there is also a legal distinction between a \\"person\\" and a \\"human being.\\" For instance, a corporation can be a legal \\"person\\" without being a \\"human being\\". In 2015, ALFADA pursued the release of Sandra from the Buenos Aires zoo and a legal decision to give her status as a \\"person\\" through an amparo application in court, which raised the issue of the legal status and rights of the orangutan under the Codigo Civil Argentino or Argentina Civil Code, under articles 30, 31, 32, 51, 52, 56, and 57. The civil code has two relevant categories, \\"personas de existencia visible\\" (visible existing persons), applied to corporeal entities such as minors and disabled persons, and \\"personas de existencia ideal\\" (ideal existing persons), applied to legal incorporeal entities such as a corporation given \\"person\\" status in the law. Article 51 defines \\"personas de existencia visible\\" as having \\"signos característicos de humanidad.\\" There is no \\"non-human person\\" category in the code. On October 21, 2015, Justice Elena Liberatori ruled that a technical committee would issue a binding decision later on how Sandra would be accommodated with her new rights. That eventually would lead to Sandra's release to a sanctuary. On June 14, 2016, an appellate court in Buenos Aires reversed the ruling of Justice Liberatori that Sandra was a non-human person.decision of the appellate court of Buenos Aires In 2019, Sandra was transferred to the Sedgwick County Zoo in Kansas and put in quarantine for a month.Time magazine https://time.com/5785018/sandra-orangutan-birthday/ On Nov. 5, 2019, she arrived at the Center for Great Apes in Wauchula, Florida.

Her research focuses on Affective Computing, which she pursued while pursuing her PhD (pending) at MIT Media's Lab Affective Computing Group with Rosalind Picard. Scheirer invented and, along with MIT, patented the Galvactivator glove which measured skin conductance through sensors on the palm and relayed the varying intensity through an LED display. She founded the intercommunication equipment and systems company Empathyx, Inc. in 2006 and co-founded the emotional analytics company Affectiva in 2009, serving as their director of operations until 2010. Scheirer has also created several visual and performance art pieces that have been featured in several galleries in Massachusetts including the MIT Museum, the Galatea Fine Art Gallery, and the Bromfield Gallery. She currently serves as CEO of the wearable company Bionolux Labs, LLC. == Education and published works== Scheirer graduated from Concord Academy in Concord, Massachusetts in 1985. She obtained a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology and English Literature from Tufts University in 1989. She then went on to earn her master's degree from Brandeis University, focusing on Developmental and Social Psychology, graduating in 1996. Scheirer later pursued a PhD in media arts and sciences while working as a research assistant in the MIT Media Lab's Affective Computing Group from 1996 to 2001. == Career == Shortly after graduating from Tufts University, Scheirer worked as a research technician under Arthur S. Tischler in the endocrine pathology lab at Tufts University School of Medicine from 1991 to 1994. She co-authored several works with Tischler concerning chromaffin cell proliferation in rats and humans. Two years later, Scheirer joined the MIT Media Lab as a research assistant in the Affective Computing Research Group and began developing affective objects, or physical objects that can record emotional data from a given subject and relay that information to that subject or to observers in a given environment. She published several studies on the topic with Rosalind Picard, the founder of the Affective Computing Research Group. While at MIT Scheirer developed several affective objects with Picard including AboutFace, eyeglasses that can track changes facial movement characteristic of confusion and interest, Touch Phone, a telephone handset supplemented with pressure sensitive foam that changed the color of an icon on the recipient's screen, and the Galvactivator, a glove that measures skin conductance and relays the information via a glowing LED. Scheirer would continue to prototype the Galvactivator device in her future companies Empathyx, Inc. and Bionolux, LLC. Affectiva also licensed the patent in 2009.US patent 6415176, \\"Sensing and Display of Skin Conductivity\\", Scheirer, J, Picard, R.W., Tilbury, N., & Farringdon, J. U.S. Patent 6415176. Issued July 2, 2002. Scheirer briefly worked as a consultant for Sherry Turkle in the Science, technology, and society department at MIT. conducting ethnographic research for Turkle's book Alone Together from 2000 to 2001. In 2006, Scheirer founded her first MIT Media Lab spinout Empathyx, Inc. where she attempted to commercialize the Galvactivator. In 2009, Affectiva licensed the Galvactivator from MIT. Rana el Kaliouby and Rosalind Picard would continue to utilize the patent over the next 3 years, developing their own skin conductance sensor called the Q Sensor which also used some of the technology from the MIT Media Lab's iCalm, another wearable physiological monitoring device. Affectiva used the Q Sensor in addition to their facial recognition software to measure physiological stress and excitement in focus groups. Affectiva discontinued their use of the \\"Q Sensor\\" in 2013 to focus their attention exclusively on their patented Affdex facial recognition software./ Following her time at Affectiva, Scheirer briefly worked as a research analyst performing statistical analysis at the Harvard Graduate School of Education from 2011 to 2012 before starting her own technology company, Bionolux Labs, LLC. == Current work == Scheirer founded the wearables research and development company Bionolux Labs, LLC in May 2014 and currently serves as CEO. Bionolux Labs’ first project is a patent-pending skin conductance ring. The company currently collaborates with institutions including NASA, NYU, and Brandeis University where she is lecturer in psychology.[34] She was elected to sit on the board of the MIT Enterprise Forum of New York City in September 2015. == Relevant published work == Below is a list of Scheirer's most notable published works in order of publishing date: {  - !

In May 2016, 19-year-old Meré was called up to the full squad for the first time, for a friendly against Bosnia and Herzegovina. ==Career statistics== {   center\\" - !rowspan=\\"2\\" Club !rowspan=\\"2\\" Season !colspan=\\"3\\" League !colspan=\\"2\\" Cup !colspan=\\"2\\" Continental !colspan=\\"2\\" Other !colspan=\\"2\\" Total - !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals - rowspan=\\"3\\"Sporting B 2013–14 rowspan=\\"2\\"Segunda División B 190colspan=\\"6\\"—190 - 2014–15 283colspan=\\"6\\"—283 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !47!!3!!colspan=\\"6\\"—!!47!!3 - rowspan=\\"4\\"Sporting Gijón 2014–15 Segunda División 5000colspan=\\"4\\"—50 - 2015–16 rowspan=\\"2\\"La Liga 25010colspan=\\"4\\"—260 - 2016–17 31010colspan=\\"4\\"—320 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !61!!0!!2!!0!!colspan=\\"4\\"—!!63!!0 - rowspan=\\"4\\"1.

His great-grandfather was Thomas Smith, founder of Smith's Bank; his father George Smith (1765–1836) was a director of the East India Company. His uncle Lord Carrington was patron of the pocket borough of Midhurst in Sussex, for which his father was a Member of Parliament (MP) from 1830 to 1831. George Robert was returned as MP at the 1831 general election, but the Reform Act abolished most of the family's pocket boroughs, and Smith was left without a seat at the 1832 general election. He contested Buckinghamshire at the 1837 general election, but without success. The following year his cousin Robert Carrington succeeded to the peerage, and George Robert was elected in his place as one of the two MPs for Wycombe. He held the seat only until the next general election, in 1841, having apparently fallen out with his conservative cousin. Smith was a director of Smith's Bank in Derby from 1837 to 1843, and of the London Smith's from 1850. In 1847 he served on the committee of the British Relief Association. == References  External links == * Category:1793 births Category:1869 deaths Category:English bankers Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for English constituencies Category:UK MPs 1831–1832 Category:UK MPs 1837–1841 George Robert ","title":"George Robert Smith (MP)"},{"id":"46382382","text":"The 189th New York State Legislature, consisting of the New York State Senate and the New York State Assembly, met from January 9, 1991, to December 31, 1992, during the ninth and tenth years of Mario Cuomo's governorship, in Albany. ==Background== Under the provisions of the New York Constitution of 1938 and the U.S. Supreme Court decision to follow the One man, one vote rule, re-apportioned in 1982 by the Legislature, 61 Senators and 150 assemblymen were elected in single-seat districts for two-year terms. Senate and Assembly districts consisted of approximately the same number of inhabitants, the area being apportioned contiguously without restrictions regarding county boundaries. At this time there were two major political parties: the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. The Conservative Party, the Right to Life Party, the Liberal Party, the New Alliance Party, the Libertarian Party, and the Socialist Workers Party also nominated tickets. ==Elections== The New York state election, 1990, was held on November 6. Governor Mario Cuomo and Lieutenant Governor Stan Lundine were re-elected, both Democrats. The elections to the other two statewide elective offices resulted in the re- election of the two incumbent officeholders: a Republican Comptroller, and a Democratic Attorney General. The approximate party strength at this election, as expressed by the vote for Governor, was: Democrats 2,086,000; Republicans 866,000; Conservatives 828,000; Right to Life 138,000; Liberals 71,000; New Alliance 31,000; Libertarians 25,000; and Socialist Workers 13,000. 22 of the sitting 23 women members of the legislature—State Senators Mary B. Goodhue (Rep.), a lawyer of Mount Kisco; Nancy Larraine Hoffmann (Dem.), of Syracuse; Olga A. Méndez (Dem.), of East Harlem; Velmanette Montgomery (Dem.), of Brooklyn; Suzi Oppenheimer (Dem.), of Mamaroneck; and Ada L. Smith (Dem.), of Queens; and Assemblywomen Barbara M.

Cook (Dem.) of Queens; Deborah J. Glick (Dem.), of Manhattan; Susan V. John (Dem.), of Rochester; and Frances T. Sullivan (Rep.), of Fulton; were also elected to the Assembly. The New York state election, 1991, was held on November 5. Three vacancies in the Assembly were filled. Assemblywoman Helen M. Marshall was elected to the New York City Council. On January 28, 1992, Joni A. Yoswein (Dem.), of Brooklyn, was elected to fill a vacancy in the Assembly.

It tells the story of a young girl, married to an older farmer, who elopes with a handsome stranger, crossing dangerous rapids on a small boat in the process. == Synopsis == In a remote place of Sweden, men working on the digging of a canal to dry up a marsh are housed in the nearby farms. In one of them live Johan and his mother together with a young girl, Marit. One of the workers tries unsuccessfully to kiss her. Some time later, while Johan is out floating timber on the other side of the river, he falls and crushes his leg. He lights a fire that Marit sees from the house. She crosses the river on a rowing boat and carries him back home and takes care of him. On his sick-bed, he asks her to be his wife. She accepts it quite unresponsively. Johan's mother is determined to avoid what she sees as a misalliance. He reminds her how 18 years before they had found her on the side of the road next to her dying mother. The mother orders Marit to leave the house but Johan, seeing the scene from his sick-bed orders her to stay and eventually marries her against his mother's will. However Marit is not happy with him. Sometimes, she remembers the handsome stranger who had kissed her and dreams of another life. She becomes more and more distant from him. One day, the handsome stranger comes back and asks Marit for a room for the night. Marit serves dinner to him and Johan. He makes them drink heavy wine and offers her a scarf. Johan wants to pay him but the stranger laughingly throws the coins in the air, keeping only one of them and Johan crawls on the ground to pick-up the rest. The following day he tries to seduce her, pointing ouot what a lonely and uninteresting life she led. To fight the attraction she unbvoluntarily feels for him, she tries to concentrate on helping Johan cleaning his fishing nets. Suddenly they see on the other side of the river the fire meaning that Johan's mother wants him to come and get her, they both freeze. Once Johan has left, she can't avoid confessing to the stranger that every summer her mother in law comes back to harass her. He tries again to kiss her but she runs indoor. The stranger shrugs his shoulders and leaves, passing Johan's mother on his way to his boat. She begins immediately to scold Marit and, when the latter threatens to leave, answers that nobody is keeping her. Marit runs out of the house telling Johan that she is fleeing his mother. She waves to the stranger who was already in the middle of the river and he comes back to pick her up. When Johan hears someone crying outside, he thinks it is Marit but it is his maid who tells him that she saw the stranger carrying Marit to his boat and rowing towards the rapids. Johan runs along the riverbank for hours without avail. Marit and the stranger sail down the river on his small boat. As they reach the rapids, she is more and more scared and asks him to take her to land and to let her go. But when they reach the shore, she realises that she has no other choice than to follow him. Johan is determined to catch the man who stole away Marit from him. His mother tells him that she went freely but Johan does not believe her. Once Marit and the stranger have reached the island where he lives in a shed, her happiness does not last very long. She does not like when he makes fun of her old husband and when she meets an old fisherman who tells her that the stranger brings a new 'summer-girl' every year to his island, she feels regret and mourns what she has lost. She tells the old man what happened with her mother in law and how much she wants to go back to her husband. The old man finds Johan who had been travelling along the river and leads him to the island. When confronted to him the stranger says laughingly that he can have his wife back. Johan starts beating him for having stolen what was the most important for him. When the stranger answers that she has come on her own will he cannot believe it and he is flabbergasted when she confesses. She begs him to forgive her, saying that she lost her head and now knows it is him whom she loves. He tells her to get in the boat and they row homewards on the river and between them comes the stillness that happiness gives.Review, synopsis and link to watch the film: ==Cast== Mathias Taube and Jenny Hasselqvist * Mathias Taube as Johan * Jenny Hasselqvist as Marit * Karin Molander as Marthe * Hildegard Harring as Johan's mother * Urho Somersalmi as the Stranger * Lilly Berg as the Maid * Nils Fredrik Widegren as the Old Fisherman == Production == The film was shot in Norrbotten in July and August 1920. As Finland was still at war with the Soviet Union at the time (the peace would only be signed in October 1920 with the Treaty of Tartu) Stiller chose to shoot it in Sweden, near the city of Kalix. The most spectacular part of the film were shot on the river Kalix with its roaring Kamlunge rapids. No tricks or stuntmen were used for the filming and Stiller paid credit to the courage of Urho Somersalmi who steered the boat through the rapids and of Jenny Hasselqvist, who was the first woman to make the travel down the Kamlunge. The managers of the local log floating association advised against the attempt as the journey through the rapids was normally done with a crew of seven men. Stiller persuaded one of them to take him down to demonstrate it was possible. The run through the rapid was filmed both by cameras on the shore and by a camera on a second boat with six men. Stiller later told how the scene had to be shot on Friday the 13th, and how it was very close to a disaster. Somersalmi was washed overboard at one of the wildest part of the rapids and saved by Hasselqvist. Later, the boat with the camera started sinking and the film was saved by the photographer who jumped overboard and waded to the shore holding the camera high above his head. Stiller declared that he would never make another film in rapids. Local inhabitants were used as extras and the old man was played by a 70 years old local fisherman.Troubled waters. Zetterlund & Thelanders Boktryckeri- Aktiebolag. Stockholm 1921 ==Release== The film premièred in Sweden on 28 February 1921 and in Finland on 17 April 1921. It was distributed in 33 markets abroad. Juhani Aho was able to attend the Première in Helsinki a few months before his death. He had himself translated the intertitles and the presentation leaflet in Finish. He wrote a letter to Mauritz Stiller stating his impressions about the adaptation. He was very enthusiastic about the acting and the technical characteristics of the film but did not hide his disappointment about the happy end introduced by Stiller.Juhani Aho: Schweres Blut. Berlin 1976 The film was long considered lost after a fire at the Swedish Film Institute in 1941. Henri Langlois, creator of the Cinémathèque Française considered that it was one of the three most important lost films. However, the largest part of one of the original negatives was found in the early 1960s. From this starting point, the film has been restored in black and white in 1974 and in a yellow and orange tinted version in 2001 which is now available on DVD with an original soundtrack by Alexander Popov. == Reviews == Reviews were mixed at the time of the Première, exuberant praise alternating with hesitant, sometimes even negative assessments. Some reviewers dismissed the film with general phrases, summaries of content, and a few kind words about the actors. Many of the reviews compared the film to Stiller's earlier film Sången om den eldröda blomman (Song of the Scarlet Flower) which also included a scene in the rapids. Svenska Dagbladet wrote: ″This is one of the Director's best works, and in all respects a film of high rank (...) What was in The Song of the Scarlet Flower dull, artificial and incoherent, is in Johan strong, genuine and solidly built.″ ==References* Johan at A Cinema History Category:1921 films Category:Films based on Finnish novels Category:Films directed by Mauritz Stiller Category:Swedish silent films Category:Swedish films Category:Swedish black-and-white films ","title":"Johan (film)"},{"id":"46382398","text":"Richard Cobb-Stevens (born on 13 March 1935 in Cambridge, MA., USA; died on 6 July 2018, Carlisle, MA) was an American Philosopher and Professor Emeritus at Boston College.http://www.bc.edu/content/dam/files/schools/cas_sites/philosophy/pdf/cobb.cv.pdf An expert in American Pragmatism, Continental Philosophy, and Phenomenology, especially Husserl and the philosophy of mathematics, Cobb-Stevens is author of three books including James and Husserl and Husserl and Analytic Philosophy.

At the 2004 census, al-Manajir had a population of 12,156. == Geography == al-Manajir lies on the right (southern) bank of the Khabur River in the midst of the fertile agricultural area of the Upper Khabur Valley, located around southeast of Ras al-Ayn and west of Tell Tamer. It administratively belongs to Nahiya Ras al- Ayn. == History== al-Manajir had an Assyrian majority with Kurdish and Arab minorities, until in 1973 Syrian president Hafez al-Assad commenced a large- scale settlement program, systematically settling Bedouins in the areas bordering Iraq and Syria to weaken the demographic dominance of the Kurds and keep the area under tighter control. After the best plots of land were redistributed to settlers of the Baggara tribe, it is said that most of the original inhabitants left the village.  Syrian Civil War  During the Syrian Civil War, the region of Manajir has remained heavily contested between late 2012 and mid-2015. Attacked by FSA rebels and allied Islamist fighters, the Syrian Army withdrew from its positions in Ras al-Ayn by the end of November 2012. The long Battle of Ras al-Ayn commenced, eventually leading to the Kurdish YPG taking control on 17 July 2013.  Kurdish capture of Manajir  In their subsequent Ras al-Ayn offensive, the YPG further advanced down the Khabur River area. In a final rush in early November, they captured one village after the other. On 5 November 2013 they successfully finished their offensive by capturing ISIS fighters to fully take control of Manajir.  Battle of Manajir  The rebel fighters however weren't ready to give in. With Baggara leader Nawaf al-Bashir purportedly supporting them from his exile in Turkey, foreign fighters were joined by local Arabs and fellow tribesmen from further south. Early in the morning of 25 January 2014, a VBIED detonated at a YPG checkpoint near Manajir, killing two Kurdish and an Arab YPG fighter. The suicide bombing was immediately followed by an attack by Islamic State fighters with T-55 tanks. While ISIS and its allies lost 23 fighters, the YPG reportedly didn't suffer any further casualties, after reinforcement units of the YPG and YPJ turned the tide. It however turned out that some of the attackers were already in the village, obviously received by local people.  Upper Khabur valley attack  On 21 February 2015, the YPG launched the Eastern al-Hasakah offensive, purging Jihadists from areas east of al-Hasakah. Two days later, the Islamic State answered with a revenge attack on dozens of villages in the Upper Khabur valley south of Tell Tamer, mostly with an ethnic Assyrian majority. In March, the Islamic State extended the attacks to the north, advancing into Kurdish-held areas around Manajir. ==References== ","title":"Al-Manajir"},{"id":"46382490","text":"BET inhibitors are a class of drugs that reversibly bind the bromodomains of Bromodomain and Extra-Terminal motif (BET) proteins BRD2, BRD3, BRD4, and BRDT, and prevent protein-protein interaction between BET proteins and acetylated histones and transcription factors. == Discovery and development == Thienodiazepine BET inhibitors were discovered by scientists at Yoshitomi Pharmaceuticals (now Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma) in the early 1990s, and their potential both as anti-inflammatories and anti-cancer agents noted. However, these molecules remained largely unknown until 2010 when both the use of JQ1 in NUT midline carcinoma and of I-BET 762 in sepsis were published. Since this time a number of molecules have been described that are capable of targeting BET bromodomains. BET inhibitors have been described that are able to discriminate between the first and second bromodomains of BET proteins (BD1 vs BD2). However, no BET inhibitor has yet been described that can reliably distinguish between BET family members (BRD2 vs BRD3 vs BRD4 vs BRDT). Only in the research context has targeting individual BET proteins been achieved by mutating them to be more sensitive to a derivative of JQ1 / I-BET 762. == Mechanism of action == Interest in using BET inhibitors in cancer began with the observation that chromosomal translocations involving BET genes BRD3 and BRD4 drove the pathogenesis the rare cancer NUT midline carcinoma. Subsequent research uncovered the dependence of some forms of acute myeloid leukemia, multiple myeloma and acute lymphoblastic leukemia on the BET protein BRD4, and the sensitivity of these cancers to BET inhibitors. In many cases, expression of the growth promoting transcription factor Myc is blocked by BET inhibitors. BRD2 and BRD3 are functionally redundant and may be more important as therapeutic targets than is appreciated in studies depleting each BET protein individually. Recent studies also showed that BET inhibitors can be instrumental in overcoming resistance to other targeted therapies when used in combination therapies. Examples include use of BET inhibitors in combination with γ-secretase inhibitors for T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and RAF- inhibitor (vemurafenib) for RAF-inhibitor resistant melanomas carrying the BRAFV600E mutation. == Specific BET inhibitors == BET inhibitors have been developed by publicly funded research labs as well as pharmaceutical companies including GlaxoSmithKline, Oncoethix (purchased by Merck & Co. in 2014), Oncoethix, Constellation pharmaceuticals, Resverlogix Corp and Zenith epigenetics. Notable BET inhibitors include:  Targeting both BD1 and BD2 (bromodomains)  * I-BET 151 (GSK1210151A) * I-BET 762 (GSK525762)GSK525762 clinical studies * OTX-015 * TEN-010 * CPI-203 * CPI-0610  Selective targeting of BD1  * olinone, e.g. to affect the differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells.

She studied in the United States and Europe and spent 30 summers in Provincetown, Massachusetts with the artist colony there. She was instructed by Blanche Lazzell there and assumed the style of the Provincetown Printers. She exhibited her works through a number of artist organizations. A native of North Carolina, she spent much of her career based in New York. ==Early life== Tannahill was born on January 11, 1863 on \\"Kinderhook\\", the family estate in Warren County, North Carolina. Her parents were Sallie Jones Sims and Robert Tannahill, a Confederate soldier and businessman who was active in Petersburg, Virginia and New York City. He moved the family to New York in 1865 and they lived at 44 East 65th Street. Her father worked as a cotton factor and between 1880 and 1882 was president of the New York Cotton Exchange. The family had a home on Lake Mahopac that they visited in the summer and a house in Englewood, New Jersey. They frequently visited Petersburg, Virginia and Warrenton, North Carolina, where other family members lived. Tannahill and her siblings were educated privately. She early displayed an interest in art that was fostered and encouraged by her parents and due to the family's wealth, she was comfortable pursuing her interest. The family was close-knit; few of the children married, and none had surviving offspring. Robert Tannahill died in 1883, leaving behind eight children, of whom Mary was the eldest. ==Education== She studied with various teachers, including Kenyon Cox, John Henry Twachtman, Harry Siddons Mowbray, J. Alden Weir, and Arthur Wesley Dow. From late May to early October in 1895, she studied under Theodore Robinson in Townshend, Vermont. He had just returned from his studies with Claude Monet in Giverny, France. Over 50 paintings were exhibited by his ten students at the Wheelock House. She studied art in Europe before World War I, including Germany, where she was harassed because she was assumed to be English. Mary Harvey Tannahill, Mother and daughter, 1910, photograph, Provincetown She returned to the New York and began to spend the summers on Cape Cod and in Provincetown, Massachusetts, where she later studied with Blanche Lazzell. ==Career== Mary Harvey Tannahill, Untitled (Woman sitting by a window), Competition for Women Photographers, 1912 She came to be known first for her miniatures painted with watercolor on ivory, a medium in which she met with some success. The Philadelphia Society of Miniature Painters exhibited her works early in her career and she was a member of the Pennsylvania Society of Miniature Painters. She also had an early interest in photography and submitted a photograph to the Competition for Women Photographers in 1912. She then painted with tempera and oils, and explored creating works of art with embroidery, batik, and woodblock printing, in the white-line style of the Provincetown Printers. In 1916, she exhibited at the second annual show of the Provincetown Art Association and spent more than 30 summers at the artist’s colony in Provincetown. She continued showing with the Provincetown Art Association almost yearly until 1938, displaying woodblock prints at various exhibits. She soon became a close friend of William and Marguerite Zorach and Robert Henri as well, through them becoming introduced to the work of the Art Students League of New York. In 1917, the Society of Independent Artists held their first show, in which two of her pieces were displayed. She exhibited more of her work with the Society two more times. By 1921, she exhibited her work An American Batik at the American Museum of Natural History in New York. It was also an example in the book First Lessons in Batik published in 1921. Mary Harvey Tannahill, The Sisters, 1920, oil on canvas, Greenville County Museum of Art, South Carolina Stylistically, Tannahill's work derived some of its influence from folk art, which was combined with modernism. She evinced interest in continued artistic growth throughout her career, absorbing influences such as Cubism and Precisionism in some of her later works. A Raleigh newspaper critic, writing in The News & Observer in 1937, called her an \\"unusual painter of familiar objects in the modern manner\\", and she was sometimes described as an \\"artist's artist\\"; she herself said that \\"her work was considered modern but not overly so\\". The \\"Eight Southern Women\\" exhibit, held in 1986 at the Museum of Art in Greenville County, South Carolina and the Gibbes Art Gallery in Charleston, included her works. Her work was displayed over her career at the Panama–Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco and at shows by the National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors. Pieces also appeared in exhibits at the Brooklyn Museum, the Art Students League of New York, the Knoedler Galleries, the American Society of Miniature Painters, and the American and New York Watercolor Clubs. She was an early member of the National Association of Women Painters and sculptors, and was active in a variety of North Carolina artists' organizations as well, including the North Carolina Professional Artists' Club, of which she eventually served as vice- president. Tannahill's paintings and fabrics can be found in the Newark Museum, Greenville County Museum of Art, Greenville, South Carolina, Zimmerli Art Museum at Rutgers University, and in many private collections. Her work is at the Bibliothèque nationale de France. A collection of her work is on display in Warrenton, at the Green-Polk-McAuslan House within the Warrenton Historic District. ==Personal life== Tannahill, described as having been tall, blond, and striking in appearance in her youth, never married. She was a Christian Scientist who believed in suffrage for women. She lived in New York by 1914, giving her address as Van Dyck Studios at 939 Eighth Avenue. Beginning in 1916, she spent her summers in Massachusetts a tradition that she continued for 30 summers. She spent the last years of her life and died in Warrenton. She was buried in Petersburg at Blandford Cemetery. ==Legacy== Since her death, Tannahill's work has continued to be included in exhibitions, such as Eight Southern Women at the Greenville County Museum of Art in 1986 and Nine from North Carolina in 1989 at the National Museum of Women in the Arts and in a traveling show, like the exhibit sponsored by the Fayetteville Museum of Art in North Carolina. ==References Category:1863 births Category:1951 deaths Category:American women painters Category:Modern painters Category:19th-century American painters Category:Painters from North Carolina Category:20th-century American painters Category:People from Warren County, North Carolina Category:American women printmakers Category:Embroiderers Category:Artists from New York City Category:Painters from New York (state) Category:Portrait miniaturists Category:American portrait painters Category:20th-century American women artists Category:19th-century American women artists Category:20th-century American printmakers Category:Burials in Virginia Category:19th-century women textile artists Category:19th-century textile artists ","title":"Mary Tannahill"},{"id":"46382508","text":"Knox Farm Historic District is a historic farm complex and national historic district located near Cleveland, Rowan County, North Carolina.

Sir Francis Palgrave, though he calls him \\"one of the greatest Barons of the Cotentin,\\" says he was only accompanied by \\"five knights who held of him.\\" Dugdale, however, gives him \\"forty-seven stout Knights of name and note,\\" and he was rewarded for his services by the grant of no less than fifty-five manors in Somerset, besides two in Wiltshire and Dorset. He chose Dunster — a place of some note in Saxon times — and built his castle where a former fortress of the West Saxon kings had stood, in a situation unsurpassed in beauty by any in England\\". The descent of the de Mohun family, feudal barons of Dunster, was as follows:Sanders, p.114 William de Moyon (died post 1090) thumb Domesday Book, Somerset, start of chapter listing 55 land-holdings of William de Moyon in Sumersete, first three entries are: Stochelande (Stockland), Seaberton and Torre (Dunster): TERRA(E) WILLELMI DE MOION ... ipse ten(et) TORRE; ibi e(st) castellu(m) ei(us); Aluric tenuit T(empore) E(dwardi) R(egis); geld(aba)t p(ro) dim(idia) hida ...

Five and a half knights' fees are distinctly stated to have been \\"of the new feoffment\\", that is to say creations of the period subsequent to the reign of King Henry I, and when an aid was levied in 1168, on account of the marriage of the King's daughter, William III de Mohun refused to pay on more than forty-one, persisting in this refusal until the end of his life\\".

Following Richmond's accession to the throne as King Henry VII (1485–1509), he obtained the reward from that king of a reversal of his father's attainder and received restoration of his lands from the Herberts, who had never lived at Dunster, having been long seated in Wales.

The former manor house of the Hadleys survives as Court Place in the village of Withycombe.

In consequence of this consanguinity in 1557 a papal bull was procured from Pope Paul V to sanction the marriage.BLG, p.1438 The legal difficulties encountered by the marriage are related by Maxwell-Lyte as follows:Maxwell-Lyte, pp.168–9 :\\"The date and the exact circumstances of the marriage are not recorded, but we may fairly suppose it to have taken place in the reign of Edward the Sixth (1547–1553), when ecclesiastical discipline was somewhat lax. The validity of it was evidently challenged in the stricter reign of Philip and Mary (1553–1558), for the parties found it desirable to have recourse to Rome. A solemn document issued by the Cardinal of St. Angelo, Papal Penitentiary, at St. Peter's, on the 28th of November 1558, recites that Thomas Luttrell Esquire and Margaret Hadley had by their petition confessed that they had, without proper dispensation, been actually married, although related in the third and third, and in the third and fourth degrees of kindred, and although spiritually related, the mother of Thomas having stood godmother to Margaret at her baptism or confirmation. The language of the document leaves it doubtful whether the marriage had been solemnized in public and whether any issue had been actually born. Its effect, however, was to release the parties from the excommunication that they had incurred on condition of a fresh marriage \\"in the face of the church\\", and to legitimate any previous offspring. ... The dispensation, having been issued a few days after the accession of Elizabeth, was probably one of the very latest documents of the sort that was despatched before the final breach between England and Rome, and the sequel is perhaps the most curious part of the story. For nearly two years no further action was taken in the matter, but on the 27th of August 1560, Thomas Luttrell was solemnly married in the church of East Quantockshead, his bride being described in the register as \\"Mrs (i.e. \\"Mistress\\") Margaret Hadley\\". Their eldest son, George Luttrell, was born in the following month. In the inscription on the monument which he set up in memory of his parents, some sixty years later, it is expressly stated that they were 'lawfully married'\\". It was probably the last instance in England of the remarriage of two persons who had been divorced on the score of a spiritual relationship.

He was twice Member of Parliament for Minehead, in 1572 and 1584.See his History of Parliament biography He was twice Sheriff of Somerset, in 1593 and 1609 and built the pier in Minehead harbour. He embarked on a major rebuilding of the Castle, to the designs of the Somerset architect William Arnold (fl.1595–1637), which produced a Jacobean mansion, much of which exists today, having survived the Victorian remodelling. He married twice: *Firstly to Joan Stucley, daughter of Hugh Stucley of Marsh (now Marshwood, Blue Anchor), near Dunster, Somerset.

She developed a style of portraiture based on the principles he taught, including a spontaneous approach and a lack of trivial detail. She lived in Colorado and Minnesota before returning to Boston in 1877, where she worked out of a studio at 17 South Russell Street until 1887.

Her lineage was respectable; she was the great-granddaughter of John Pintard of New York, granddaughter of a well-known doctor from New Orleans, and daughter of a wealthy Louisiana businessman. Turner spent much of her early life between Alexandria, Louisiana and New Orleans, and early became a refugee from the American Civil War, which destroyed her father's fortune and led to the loss of his business. Her mother died in 1865 after a long illness; her father's death when she was thirteen left her in the care of a widowed uncle in New Orleans who lived in \\"genteel poverty\\". Turner began painting at twenty-two; her early works were portraits and bayou landscapes. Initially self-taught, she began taking free classes offered by Tulane University, continuing under the tutelage of Andres Molinary and Bror Anders Wikstrom; she also studied at the Artists' Association of New Orleans. The death of her uncle in 1890 meant that she had to support herself, and she took a position teaching art at St. Mary's Institute, a girls' school in Dallas, Texas, beginning in 1893. She moved to New York City in 1895, for further study and attended the Art Students League (where she was accepted despite being, at thirty-seven, beyond the age limit for admittance), Cooper Union and Columbia University; her teachers included Arthur Wesley Dow,Kenyon Cox, William Merritt Chase and Douglas Volk.Petteys, Chris, \\"Dictionary of Women Artists: An international dictionary of women artists born before 1900\\", G.K. Hall & Co., Boston, 1985 Heller, Jules and Nancy G, Heller, ed., \\"North American Women Artists of the Twentieth Century: A Biographical Dictionary\\" Garland Reference Library of the Humanities (Vol. 1219), Garland Publishing Company, New York & London, 1995 Her sister Laurette (\\"Lettie\\"), a textile artist, came to New York with her. Turner traveled with Chase and his class to Italy in 1904, 1905, and 1911, but otherwise appears to have shown scant interest in studying abroad, unlike other American Impressionists. Turner taught at the YWCA for seventeen years, starting with a newly created class on costume design. Beginning in 1906 she summered at the artists' colony in Cragsmoor, New York, to which she was introduced by Charles Courtney Curran; she continued there with few interruptions until 1941. In her early years there she rented space, but in 1910 she built a home and studio called Takusan. Her sister Lettie died in 1920; in 1926 she returned to New Orleans and resettled there, traveling north only for her summer sojourns. In New Orleans she continued to teach at the Arts and Crafts Club, where her subject was draped-model drawing. She was elected an associate of the National Academy of Design in 1913, receiving 61 out of 64 votes, and was elected a full member in 1921, only the third woman to achieve the distinction and one of the first Academicians from the Southern United States. Furthermore, in 1916 William T. Evans nominated her an Artist Life Member of the National Arts Club; there, too, she was one of the first women accorded the honor. She continued to paint into the 1930s, but her eyesight gradually deteriorated; eventually she developed cateracts, and she was unable to paint at all after 1949. Turner lived to be nearly a hundred. At her death she was buried at Metairie Cemetery; the funeral was held at Trinity Episcopal Church. ==Work== With its \\"broken\\" technique, blonde palette, and concern with the effect of light on her subjects, Turner's style has been described as Impressionistic. Unusually, it seems to have been developed almost exclusively in the United States, with few outside influences noted. None of her early work, from her first years in New Orleans, is known to survive; it is believed to have likely been academic in nature given what is known of her first instructors. Of her later teachers, she gave credit only to Volk and to Cox for the development of her style. Her work has been described as \\"unpretentious\\" and revealing, \\"unconsciously, a woman's point of view.\\" Her subjects were frequently women, often depicted in musical pursuits. She experimented with tapestry work as well; a small number of piece worked with her sister Lettie are still known to exist. A handful of Turner's paintings were executed in her quarters in Manhattan, but the bulk of them were created during her summer sojourns at Cragsmoor. The colony influenced much of Turner's work; while there she developed a love of gardening which translated itself into the floral backgrounds seen in many of her paintings. Turner received many awards throughout her career, including the Cooper Union (New York City) bronze medal; the Elling prize for landscape from the New York Woman's Art Club; the National Arts prize from the Association of Painters and Sculptors; the Julia A. Shaw Memorial Prize from the National Academy of Design; and the John G. Agar prize from the National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors. She exhibited widely as well, showing at the New York Water Color Club, the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts in Philadelphia, the American Society of Miniature Painters at the National Academy of Design in New York City, and the Corcoran Gallery in Washington, D.C, and being included in the exhibit Six American Women organized by the City Museum of St. Louis. Her paintings were purchased by major collectors such as Duncan Phillips.

He was aware of the relation between the Montenegrins and the Republic of Venice. After hearing of talks between Metropolitan Rufim Boljević and provveditore Zeno, he tried by all means to break that alliance and to separate the Montenegrins and Brđani from the Venetians. During the Great Turkish War, in 1685, he led a contingent that approached Cetinje, and on the way clashed with hajduks in Venetian service under the command of Bajo Pivljanin at the hill of Vrtijeljka (in the Battle of Vrtijeljka), where they annihilated the hajduks. It is claimed that Süleyman managed to penetrate into Cetinje only with the help of the Brđani, who were in feud with the Montenegrin tribes. Afterwards, the victorious Ottomans paraded with 500 severed heads through Cetinje, and also attacked the Cetinje monastery and the palace of Ivan Crnojević. Süleyman had Bajo's head sent to the Sultan as a trophy. In 1686 he attacked Budva. In March and May 1688, he attacked the Kuči tribe. The Kuči, under Vojvode Ivan Drekalović, with help from Klimenti and Piperi, destroyed the army of Süleyman, took over Medun and got their hands of large quantities of weapons and equipment. Süleyman entered Cetinje again in 1692, again with the help of the Brđani, and pushed out the Venetians, reasserting his rule over Montenegro which had been under Venetian protection. At that time, the Brđani had little respect of their co-religious tribal neighbours, as plunder was their main income. He reached an agreement with Venetians with 11 terms under which they were to retreat from Cetinje. However, before leaving, Venetians rigged their former stronghold in monastery with time controlled explosive. The impact later caused heavy havoc among the Ottomans, and Suleyman himself was seriously wounded.http://www.montenegrina.net/pages/pages1/istorija/crnojevici/cetinjski_manastir_na_cipuru.htm ==AnnotationsReferences== Category:17th-century Ottoman military personnel Category:Ottoman generals Category:Ottoman governors of Scutari Category:People of the Great Turkish War Category:Bushati family ","title":"Süleyman, sanjak-bey of Scutari"},{"id":"46382990","text":"Horace Newton Polley (March 10, 1842 - September 18, 1914) was a farmer, musician, stonemason, and politician.

The first few abdominal segments are sculptured with fine transverse grooves at the front of each segment with a smoother area behind. ==Distribution and habitat== Although this spiny lobster was originally known only from St Paul and neighbouring New Amsterdam Islands in the southern Indian Ocean, more recently it has been discovered on other seamounts on the Southwest Indian Ridge, so its range is rather larger than originally thought. A previously recognised species Jasus tristani, found around Tristan da Cunha in the southern Atlantic Ocean, has now been synonymised with J. paulensis. This is an uncommon species throughout its range and is usually found at depths between but occasionally down to about . It is found on rocks and among kelp. ==Ecology== Jasus paulensis is nocturnal. It feeds on seaweeds and scavenges on dead animal material. The eggs are laid from May onwards and the female incubates them under her tail for several months. ==Fishery== Early visitors to St Paul found that it was possible to catch a lobster by hand in shallow water in the crater lake bay, take it to a nearby submarine hot spring, and cook it, without ever removing it from the water. In 1928, a large-scale fishery and cannery for the spiny lobster using lobster pots was set up on St Paul, but the company went bankrupt three years later, stranding seven people on the island and leading to a tragedy known as \\"Les Oubliés de Saint-Paul\\" (the forgotten ones of Saint-Paul). In the next two decades, there were several, largely unsuccessful, attempts to harvest the lobsters using factory ships. In the period 1950 to 1956, the spiny lobsters were harvested by the French company Sapmer with about 260 tonnes of lobster tails being processed annually (equivalent to about 800 tonnes of whole lobster). This company still operates factory vessels equipped with deep-freeze facilities in the area. Before 1950, the rock lobster on the Tristan da Cunha archipelago was only fished for local consumption. Since then, companies such as the South Atlantic Islands Development Corporation have exploited it. Production peaked in the 1970s, with over 800 tonnes being collected in some years, but the industry has since waned, with less than 400 t being caught most years since 1992. The fishery became MSC-certified in 2011, and the current TAC total still stands at about 400 tonnes annually. Since 1996 it has been harvested by Ovenstone Agencies in a partnership with the Island Govt scheduled to last at least until 2026. ==References== Category:Achelata Category:Edible crustaceans Category:Crustaceans of the Atlantic Ocean Category:Fauna of Tristan da Cunha Category:Fauna of Gough Island Category:Crustaceans described in 1862 ","title":"Jasus paulensis"},{"id":"46383024","text":"Jeannette Zarou (; born 1942, Ramallah) is a Palestinian-born Canadian soprano.

His 2014 film, The Overnighters, was shortlisted for best documentary feature at the Oscars. Moss has directed four independent, feature-length films and three television documentaries and has produced 15 documentaries. Moss teaches filmmaking at San Francisco State University and lives in the Bay Area with his wife and frequent collaborator Amanda McBaine and their two children. ==Life and career== Moss was born and raised in Palo Alto, California. Though Moss never had any childhood aspirations toward filmmaking, his parents valued journalism. While he was growing up in his father’s house, a frequent guest was the renowned photojournalist Richard Boyle, who was famously depicted as a conflict-prone character dealing with substance abuse problems in Oliver Stone’s 1986 movie Salvador. Boyle came to stay in the Moss’ home and regaled the young Jesse Moss and his brother with stories of his adventures overseas. “In a way, that was inspiring,” Moss told David Poland in 2014. Moss graduated from the University of California-Berkeley in 1993. He didn’t go to university intending to study film. He was interested in American history. Following graduation, he moved to Washington, D.C. where he worked with Congressman Vic Fazio for three years, eventually moving up the ranks to become a policy assistant and speechwriter. Although he enjoyed his work in politics, he felt creatively frustrated. When he was 26, he met Christine Choy, a documentary filmmaker who was showing her film Who Killed Vincent Chin? He was struck that documentary film could be journalistic, political and artistic. He decided to try filmmaking. He quit his job, moved to New York in 1996 and began working for Christine Choy. Later, he worked as an in-house producer at Cabin Creek Films for acclaimed documentary filmmaker Barbara Kopple, who had made Harlan County, USA (1976) and American Dream (1990). \\"Harlan County, USA is the high water mark of documentary filmmaking for me,” Moss told IndieWire. “It really takes us inside that extractive industry and finds the human heart of that experience.” The film won the 1977 Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature. As of Spring 2015, Moss is currently working on Reality Party, a new short film about a group of Southern California teenagers who throw a “fake” party, according to Moss’ website. ==Film directing== Moss’ first feature-length documentary was Con Man (2002), which explores the life of James Arthur Hogue, a skilled imposter who fabricated a spectacular series of fictional identities for himself and successfully conned his way into Princeton University. Moss was director and producer. In 2004, Moss made Speedo: A Demolition Derby Love Story, which he wrote, produced and directed. Speedo follows the promising racing career and troubled family life of Ed “Speedo” Jager, one of the nation’s top demolition derby drivers. In 2008, Moss made Full Battle Rattle with co-director Tony Gerber. The film is the story of “a real war and a fake town,” specifically, the Iraq Simulation that the US Army has built in the Mojave Desert, which it uses to help train its army units before they deploy to Iraq. Jesse Moss and Tony Gerber were granted permission to live inside the simulation for the duration of a three-week training rotation. Moss and Gerber filmed on both sides of the “war”: Gerber lived with the Army Brigade in training and Moss lived in Medina Wasl. New York magazine called the film “an indelible vision of modern war” and The New York Times wrote: “Remarkably thorough and detailed. The film emphasizes the strangeness and complexity of the conflict.” Moss is best known for his 2014 film The Overnighters, which Eric Kohn of Indiewire called “one of the most remarkable examples of layered non-fiction storytelling to come along in some time” and the Los Angeles Times called “Exceptional…a film of disquieting moral complexity.” The Overnighters follows the story of Pastor Jay Reinke, a Lutheran minister in Williston, North Dakota, where the oil boom has attracted desperate men looking for work while also causing a severe housing shortage in the area. Reinke opens his church to the men, undermining his place in the eyes of several members his congregation. The Overnighters was shortlisted for Best Documentary Feature at the Oscars and was named best documentary of 2014 by Indiewire’s “The Playlist”,\\"The 22 Best Documentaries Of 2014\\".

Jeanette Catsoulis of The New York Times praised Moss for his “observational, near-invisible presence” in The Overnighters. Moss is also known for working with a small or nonexistent crew, partially because of budget constraints and partially because of the increased mobility a one-man crew allows for.

The enclos paroissial comprises the church of Saint-Jean- Baptiste, a large ornamental fountain, the cemetery, two ossuaries attached to the church and an enclosing wall with an \\"arc de triomphe\\" style entrance. Saint-Jean-du-Doigt is some 12 kilomètres northeast of Morlaix. The church dates back to around 1440 when the Duke of Brittany, Jean V, founded the church as a suitable place to hold the John the Baptist relic (see note below). This relic reputedly has the power to restore sight. The church, fountain, double cemetery gate, funeral chapel and the cemetery and its wall are listed historical monuments. Eglise Saint-Jean-Baptiste ==The enclos cross and nearby calvary== There is no grand calvary but there is a cross bearing the crucified Christ in the cemetery and a calvary nearby at Pen-ar-C'hra. The cross in the cemetery is 7 metres high and dates to 1877. The cross is inscribed There are archival notes stating that the cross was transported from Quimper. At Pen-ar-C'hra, near the enclos, there is a fountain and calvary commemorating the relic of John the Baptist's finger. The legend has it that a young archer in the service of a local knight was staying at Saint-Jean-de-Day in Normandy when he was shown the relic, became obsessed with it and wanted to keep it. He was thrown into prison for sorcery by the local community but woke up by a fountain in Traon-Mériadec, the ancient name for Saint-Jean-du-Doigt. In this way the relic came to Saint-Jean-du-Doigt and the fountain and calvary commemorates these events. The calvary, erected in 1757, has a sculpture of John the Baptist ==The entrance to the enclos== The triumphal arch at Saint- Jean-du-Doigt with access stairs on the right. Note the pinnacled buttresses and the niched statues of Saints John and Roch. The statue of Saint Roch is carved from wood The wooden statue of Saint Roch The Saint-Jean-du-Doigt Parish close is accessed through a Triumphal arch (arc de triomphe) designed by Le Taillanter in 1584. Le Taillanter had designed the tower of Plougasnou's church. Through this entrance you leave the secular world behind and enter the sacred world represented by the church. It is an ornate structure with two pinnacled buttresses and two niches each containing a dais on which are sculptures of John the Evangelist on the right and Saint Roch on the left. These have, not surprisingly, deteriorated quite badly. On the right hand side of the arch there is another entrance with a few stairs allowing access for pedestrians. ==Fountain== The Holy Father spreads out his arms to bless his son who is being baptized by John the Baptist. Water flows from a circle of angel's head running around the basin Outside the church is a fine fountain carved from Kersanton stone and dating to 1691. The fountain was the work of the Morlaix mason Jacques Lespaignol and the architect Yves Lageat. A central pillar supports three tiers of circular basins which reduce in size as they reach the fountain's summit and from these basins water flows from the mouths of the heads of small angels arranged around the basin's rims. At the top the Holy Father blesses his son whom John the Baptist is baptizing. These statues are made from lead.

It had been 22 metres high and covered with lead tiles. It had been restored in 1571 but was hit by lightning on several occasions over the years and was totally destroyed in 1925. It was never rebuilt. ==South porch== Over the church's south porch there is an archive. Outside the porch are two stoups and a window accessing to the archive. The coats of arms on the gable were chiseled away during the French revolution. Apart from the stoups, there is a statue of John the Baptist. ==The church interior== The Gothic \\"Chapelle de l'Isle\\" dates to between 1507 and 1513. The church has two octagonal fonts dating to the 16th century. The stained glass windows are modern and are by the Orléans's artist Louis-René Petit, and were unveiled by the Bishop of Quimper on 24 June 1990. They depict scenes representing Christ's baptism and Transfiguration in the large chevet window, the Tree of Jesse for the window in the \\"Chapelle de l'Isle\\", and the Apocalypse in the bay by the south porch. The church holds several \\"Enfeus\\", these being fireplace-like structures which indicate the presence of tombs behind the wall where they appear. The church has a fine oratory and, apart from John the Baptist's finger, possesses a silver reliquary dating to the 16th century said to contain the head of Saint Mériadec and another said to contain the arm of Saint Maudet. On 5 November 1955, the church suffered a major fire and several priceless works of Breton art were lost, including the altarpiece on the main altar dating to 1670 and the altarpieces by Lespaignol dedicated to Saint Mériadec and Saint Elizabeth dating to 1723. A rood screen (\\"poutre de gloire\\") dating to 1571 was also lost. ==The \\"Maison du Government\\" or the \\"\\"Grande Maison de Saint-Jean\\"== This building is part of the enclos and dates to between 1562 and 1572. It served as the residence of the governor of the Chapelle saint-Jean-Baptiste. ==Note== It is recorded that in around 1418 a young man from Plougasnou, possibly an archer, was shown what was said to be the index finger of John the Baptist and became devoted to it. The finger was kept in the church of Saint-Jean-de-Daye. The finger had been given by the Patriarch of Jerusalem to Saint Tècle at the time of the crusades and the saint had had the church of Saint-Jean-de-Daye built. The young archer had caused the relic to be brought to Brittany and the Duke, Jean V, presented a reliquary to hold the finger to a chapel in Saint-Jean-du-Doigt dedicated to Saint Mériadec. Over the succeeding years so many pilgrims visited the chapel that it was decided to replace the chapel with a larger church. Thus was born the Eglise Saint Jean-Baptiste in Saint-Jean-du-Doigt. ==Gallery of images== File:Saint-Jean-du-Doigt (29) Église 03.jpgThe Saint-Jean-du-Doigt chevet File:013 Saint-Jean-du-Doigt L'oratoire du sacre 1577.JPGThe 1577 \\"Oratoire du Sacre\\".

The piece was composed in 1936 and was premiered by the BBC Symphony Orchestra under the conductor Leslie Heward in 1939.Grimshaw, p. 624. The work commemorates the genocide of the Armenian people, including Hovhaness's paternal family, during the Ottoman Turkish occupation of World War I. The symphony is dedicated to English writer and philosopher Francis Bacon. The work's U.S. premiere was given on 6 December 1942 by the NBC Symphony Orchestra conducted by Leopold Stokowski. This performance was broadcast over the radio. Around 1970 the composer replaced the central movement with a completely new one. ==Reception== Response to the premiere was positive, with Leslie Heward heralding Hovhaness as a \\"young genius.\\" However, later reception of the work has not always been as favourable. Reviewing a recording of Exile by Gerard Schwarz and the Seattle Symphony Orchestra, Anthony Burton of BBC Music Magazine wrote, \\"Hovhaness’s astonishing productivity is achieved at the cost of self-criticism: the folk-like melodies can all too often seem four-square and predictable, the chromatic decoration banal doodling, the technically proficient fugues simply note-spinning.\\" Burton added, \\"Not even the skilful and ardent advocacy of the Seattle Symphony, beautifully recorded, can persuade me that there is [...] much more than the picturesque about the early Exile Symphony.\\" ==See also== *List of compositions by Alan Hovhaness ==ReferencesBibliography== * 1 Category:1936 compositions Category:20th-century classical music Category:Compositions for symphony orchestra Category:Works about the Armenian Genocide ","title":"Symphony No. 1 (Hovhaness)"},{"id":"46383664","text":"742 Naval Air Squadron (742 NAS) was a Naval Air Squadron of the Royal Navy's Fleet Air Arm. ==References== Citations Bibliography * Category:700 series Fleet Air Arm squadrons Category:Military units and formations established in 1943 Category:Military units and formations of the Royal Navy in World War II ","title":"742 Naval Air Squadron"},{"id":"46383672","text":"Siragadikka Aasai () is a 1994 Tamil-language comedy-drama film directed by Vijayachandran.

With its woollen pompoms, the picturesque- looking red Bollenhut has become a symbol of the Black Forest as a whole, despite its very local origins. The red pom-poms and white brim of the Bollenhut also is said to have inspired the top layer of the Black Forest Cake.http://sweets.seriouseats.com/2014/01/know-your-sweets-black-forest- cake.html == Bollenhut as part of folk costume == The broad-brimmed, whitewashed straw hat bears 14 prominent, woollen, pompoms arranged in the shape of a cross. Only eleven pompoms are visible, however, because three are covered by those on top. Unmarried women wear red pompoms, married women wear black, old women and widows wear only the mob cap. The Bollenhut can weigh up to two kilogrammes and is manufactured by female milliners. The red Bollenhut may first be worn by girls at their confirmation. A silk mob cap is worn underneath the Bollenhut, tied under the chin. Young girls before confirmation (Gutach and several neighbouring parishes were part of Württemberg until 1804 and were Protestant, unlike the majority of the Black Forest) and old women only wore the mob cap. Today the Bollenhut and associated Tracht are still worn on holidays and for traditional events. The Bollenhut and local costumes may be seen all year round e.g. in the Black Forest Costume Museum in Haslach im Kinzigtal. == Development as a Black Forest symbol == In the late 18th century, apart from several mob caps, the Schühut and Gupfhut, which were customary in the County of Hauenstein, were associated with the folk costume of the Black Forest. These types of hats which were known Europe-wide gradually fell out of use by the middle of the 19th century. In 1841 following a study trip through the Black Forest, Théodore Valerio published, through the Fréres Gihaut in Paris, a lithograph of a couple from Hornberg wearing their local costume, which showed an early version of the Bollenhut for the first time in France. After Gutach was connected to the Baden Black Forest Railway in 1873, artists like Wilhelm Hasemann, Curt Liebich and Fritz Reiss settled there, forming the \\"Gutach artists' colony\\". They portrayed the Gutach costume as an artistic subject, their works were widely distributed and shaped the image of the Black Forest. Like local author, Heinrich Hansjakob, they were part of a movement of Baden folk costume. At the turn of the 20th century, particularly Hasemann's painting, After Going To Church which showed Bollenhut wearers, was widely publicized in illustrated magazines and picture postcards.Brigitte Heck: Ein Hut macht Karriere.. In: Badisches Landesmuseum Karlsruhe (publ.): Baden! 900 Jahre – Geschichten eines Landes. Info-Verlag, Karlsruhe, 2012, , p. 256 (Katalog zur Großen Landesausstellung) The fame of the Bollenhut as (wrongly) generally typical of the Black Forest rose as a result of films of local life (Heimatfilme) in the 1950s and 1960s, particularly the 1950 film, The Black Forest Girl (Schwarzwaldmädel), with Sonja Ziemann. This first German colour film of the post war period is one of the most successful German films of all time with an estimated 15 million viewers. == References  External links == *Haslach Trachten Museum *Reichenbach Music and Trachten Club with organisational Bollenhut Tracht Category:Hats Category:Folk costumes Category:Ortenaukreis Category:Black Forest Category:German clothing ","title":"Bollenhut"},{"id":"46383696","text":"745 Naval Air Squadron (745 NAS) was a Naval Air Squadron of the Royal Navy's Fleet Air Arm. ==References== Citations Bibliography * Category:700 series Fleet Air Arm squadrons Category:Military units and formations established in 1943 Category:Military units and formations of the Royal Navy in World War II ","title":"745 Naval Air Squadron"},{"id":"46383702","text":"746 Naval Air Squadron (746 NAS) was a Naval Air Squadron of the Royal Navy's Fleet Air Arm. ==References== Citations Bibliography * Category:700 series Fleet Air Arm squadrons Category:Military units and formations established in 1942 Category:Military units and formations of the Royal Navy in World War II ","title":"746 Naval Air Squadron"},{"id":"46383713","text":"747 Naval Air Squadron (747 NAS) was a Naval Air Squadron of the Royal Navy's Fleet Air Arm. ==References== Citations Bibliography * Category:700 series Fleet Air Arm squadrons Category:Military units and formations established in 1943 Category:Military units and formations of the Royal Navy in World War II ","title":"747 Naval Air Squadron"},{"id":"46383714","text":"Pieter Rossouw may refer to: * Pieter Rossouw (cricketer) (born 1980), Namibian cricketer * Pieter Rossouw (rugby player) (born 1971), South African rugby player and coach ","title":"Pieter Rossouw"},{"id":"46383721","text":"748 Naval Air Squadron (748 NAS) was a Naval Air Squadron of the Royal Navy's Fleet Air Arm. ==References== Citations Bibliography * Category:700 series Fleet Air Arm squadrons Category:Military units and formations established in 1942 Category:Military units and formations of the Royal Navy in World War II ","title":"748 Naval Air Squadron"},{"id":"46383747","text":"749 Naval Air Squadron (749 NAS) was a Naval Air Squadron of the Royal Navy's Fleet Air Arm. ==References== Citations Bibliography * Category:700 series Fleet Air Arm squadrons Category:Military units and formations established in 1941 Category:Military units and formations of the Royal Navy in World War II ","title":"749 Naval Air Squadron"},{"id":"46383758","text":"The Abbey of Chiaravalle della Colomba (Italian: Abbazia di Chiaravalle della Colomba) is a 12th-century Cistercian monastic complex near the town of Alseno, in the Province of Piacenza, Region of Emilia-Romagna, Italy. Facade of church ==History== The founding documents for the Abbey date to 11 April 1136, when Arduino, the bishop of Piacenza, granted the monastery its lands. The abbey was also patronized by the Marquises Oberto Pallavicino and Corrado Cavalcabò. One tradition holds that the name Colomba or pigeon was attached due to a legend that a white pigeon had selected the site. But more likely the title Santa Maria della Colomba derives from the pigeon used to symbolize the annunciation of Mary's pregnancy. The abbey was founded soon after the other Abbey of Chiaravalle, also called Chiaravalle Milanese was founded near Milan. The monastery was sacked and burned in 1248 by Frederick II of Swabia during his siege of Parma. In 1769, the abbey was suppressed by the Duke of Parma, and the remaining monks were moved to the Abbey of San Martino de' Bocci. The order was able to repurchase the abbey some 8 years later. However, by 1805, Napoleon's rule had again led to suppression of the order. In 1810, the surrounding properties were assigned to the Civil Hospital of Piacenza. The archive, library, and much of the property was dispersed and sold. Cistercian monks were only to return in 1937; and the property has joint ownership with the state. The cloistered monks maintain limited agricultural efforts. ==Architecture== The church was erected during the 12th and 13th centuries, but was refurbished during the 15th century. The belltower was added in the 16th century. In the 19th century, restorations encountered buildings in near ruin. The church has Gothic architecture and Romanesque architecture elements. It retains the tomb of Oberto Pallavacino (died 1148). The square 13th-century cloister has a proliferation of arched openings, flanked by rose marble paired columns. ==References== *Monastery official website.

Agrometeorology mainly involves the interaction of meteorological and hydrological factors, on one hand and agriculture, which encompasses horticulture, animal husbandry, and forestry. Horticulture is strongly influenced by climatic variations, however small. It is an interdisciplinary, holistic science forming a bridge between physical and biological sciences and beyond. It deals with a complex system involving soil, plant, atmosphere, agricultural management options, and others, which are interacting dynamically on various spatial and temporal scales. Specifically, the fully coupled soil- plant-atmosphere system has to be well understood in order to develop reasonable operational applications or recommendations for stakeholders. For these reasons, a comprehensive analysis of cause-effect relationships and principles that describe the influence of the state of the atmosphere, plants, and soil on different aspects of agricultural production, as well as the nature and importance of feedback between these elements of the system is necessary. Agrometeorological methods therefore use information and data from different key sciences such as soil physics and chemistry, hydrology, meteorology, crop and animal physiology and phenology, agronomy, and others. Observed information is often combined in more or less complex models, focused on various components of system parts such as mass balances (i.e. soil carbon, nutrients, and water), biomass production, crop growth and yield, and crop or pest phenology in order to detect sensitivities or potential responses of the soil-biosphere-atmosphere system. However, model applications still involve many uncertainties, which calls for further improvements of the description of system processes. A better quality of operational applications at various scales (monitoring, forecasting, warning, recommendations, etc.) is crucial for stakeholders. For example, new methods for spatial applications involve GIS and Remote Sensing for spatial data presentation and generation. Further, tailor-made products and information transfer are critical to allow effective management decisions in the short and long term. These should cover sustainability and enhancement strategies (including risk management, mitigation and adaptation) considering climate variability and change. Papers are invited addressing these problems in the context of agrometeorological applications in “atmosphere” as an actual and important contribution to the state of the art. ==References * INSAM - The International Society for Agricultural Meteorology Category:Agriculture Category:Branches of meteorology ","title":"Agrometeorology"},{"id":"46383775","text":"Tirso de Olazábal y Lardizábal, 1st Count of Arbelaiz, 1st Count of Oria (28 January 1842 – 25 November 1921), was a Spanish noble and Carlist politician. ==Family and early life== Origins Tirso as a child Tirso Julián Francisco José Ramón María de Olazábal y Lardizábalnot to be confused with another Carlist politician named Olazábal, both distantly related.

Homenaje a Don Faustino Menéndez Pidal de Navascués 8/1 (2004), pp. 445–446 His maternal grandmother, María Benita Ruiz de Otazu y Valencegui, also belonged to distinguished families of the Basque aristocracy. Among her ancestors are the Idiáquez of Azcoitia (later Dukes of Granada de Ega), the Counts of Peñaflorida and the Marquesses of Rocaverde. One of Tirso's maternal great-great-grandfathers, Manuel Ignacio de Altuna y Portu (1722–1762), was a major figure of Enlightenment in Spain. Encyclopedist and scholar, Altuna became known for his friendship with Jean- Jacques Rousseau (who mentions him in his Confessions, calling him the \\"virtuous Altuna\\"), to whom he was introduced in Venice during his Grand Tour in the 1740s. Along with the Count of Peñaflorida and the Marquis of Narros, he founded the Royal Basque Society of Friends of the Country (known as La Bascongada) in Bergara, in 1748. The three men came to be known as the \\"Gentlemen of Azkoitia\\" (Los Caballeritos de Azcoitia) or the \\"Triumvirate of Azkoitia\\" (Triunvirato de Azcoitia).

Among other properties located in Guipúzcoa (spread over Azpeitia, Beasain, Beizama, Idiazabal and Lazcano), his legacy included the Arbelaiz Palace and its formidable private garden, in Irun, which had remained in the hands of his family since the reign of Philip II of Spain. This ancestral estate, which hosted various historical figures (Henry III of France, Catherine de' Medici, Charles IV of Lorraine, Catherine of Braganza, Philip V of Spain and Charles X of France, etc.) and owes its name to the powerful family who built it in the sixteenth century, passed by marriage to the Olazábal family after the wedding of Tirso's great-grandmother, the Dowager Marchioness of Valdespina, Maria Teresa de Murguía y Arbelaiz,Antonio Gaytán de Ayala Artázcoz, Parientes mayores de Guipúzcoa: señores del palacio casa-fuerte de Murguía en Astigarraga, [in:] Revista Internacional de los Estudios Vascos, París 1934, pp. 373–375 XV Lady (Señora) of Murguía and VI Lady (Señora) of Arbelaiz, with the above-mentioned Domingo José de Olazábal y Aranzate, in 1756. From his father, he also inherited the assets of the majorat (mayorazgo) of Abaria, founded in the seventeenth century by Francisco de Abaria, of whom Olazábal descended through his paternal grandmother, María Brígida de Olaso y Abaria. This majorat (mayorazgo) included, primarily, the Abaria Palace, in Villafranca de Oria, which during the Third Carlist War, and on the occasion of the Carlist Meeting that were held there, would provide accommodation to Carlos VII.

Olazábal opposed the plan, though not because he sided with the immovilistas; he rather seemed anxious that Carlism might deliver an embarrassingly poor showing.Real Cuesta 1985, p. 220 He was overruled and entrusted with a prestigious task: in the Guipuzcoan Azpeitia district he was to defeat Ramón Nocedal, leader of the Integrist rebels. Carlos VII was frantic to see Nocedal humiliatedFernández Escudero 2012, p. 231; there were plans that instead of Olazábal it should be Menendez Pelayo or even de Cerralbo running; in case of the latter he would have to renounce his senate chair, Fernández Escudero 2012, p. 232 and remarked that in case of defeat, the name of Azpeitia would be recorded next to Vergara, Oroquieta and Valcarlos.Fernández Escudero 2012, p. 232, Jordi Canal i Morell, Las “muertes” y las “resurrecciones” del carlismo.

Olazábal, apparently not much concerned with ideological differences, was inclined to accept the proposal, but he could not swallow the condition that Azpeitia would be left for them to grab the mandate.Fernández Escudero 2012, p. 247 Eventually he confronted Nocedal again and lost again, though initially the Carlist press congratulated him on victory,Fernández Escudero 2012, p. 250 the difference was mere 17 votes, and it was only following backstage haggling involving the government that in 1894 Olazábal was finally confirmed as defeated.Fernández Escudero 2012, p. 248 Don Jaime en España: crónica del viaje de S.A.R.

The declaration followed Carlist withdrawal from the parliament and was preconfiguration of the 1897 program, conceived by the movements’ leaders gathered in Venice and known as Acta de Loredán.Fernández Escudero 2012, pp. 320–1 Both declared non-belligerency but considered the Restoration system unacceptable and included mild pro-social tones.the Restoration system was described as based on caciquismo, rotten with corruption and inefficiency; Acta de Loredán called for a new Cortes, with representatives of all the classes, including agriculture, industry, army, clergy, scientific corporations, aristocracy and workers Fernández Escudero 2012, p. 322 Already the 1896 manifesto made references to problems overseas; since the conflict evolved into war with the United States, Olazábal declared that Carlists planned no trouble and their priority remained integrity of Spain.La Epoca 08.03.97, available here However, the government kept a close watch on him,González Calleja 1998, p. 196 and in July 1898 his Saint-Jean-de-Luz residence was again reported as Carlist operations centre;La Epoca 28.07.96, available here despite his continuous denials,El Pais 09.08.98, available here wild rumors related to Carlist war preparations started to circulate.press reported that 8,000 barges with steel, intended for production of artillery pieces, were smuggled into Spain, La Epoca 08.08.98 available here At that point Olazábal was already engaged in fund-raising campaign, with the same sources as 30 years earlier;his close collaborator was the English Jacobite Bertram Ashburnham, 5th Earl of Ashburnham, González Calleja 1998, p. 201, Fernández Escudero 2012, p. 353 Carlist leaders suggested he should control all party funds and co-ordinate all party foreign activities.Fernández Escudero 2012, p. 354 Though early 1899 Olazábal declared there was no reason to postpone the wedding of his daughter,La Epoca 11.04.99, available here he was already busy trafficking arms. He bought 53,000 Gras rifles, arranging later for their industrial recalibration to fit the Spanish cartridge standard.by an Arrese, Lacon & Société company He delivered a portion36 boxes, each with 29 rifles across the Pyrenees with his own network of smugglers,González Calleja 1998, p. 201 though it is not clear whether arms were directed to Vascongadas or to Catalonia.González Calleja 1998, p. 200 There were also plans to use Cap Higuer as a marine disembarkation point.González Calleja 1998, p. 201 In midst of his hectic activities Olazábal engaged in planning Guipuzcoan electoral alliances of 1899, though it is unclear whether he engineered them or simply approved them ex-post.in April 1899 Olazábal and Candido Orbe as representatives of Carlism agreed an electoral deal with the Integrists; Carlos VII issued a document stating that only he could grant mercy to the rebels, but it was already too late. The deal was officially signed not by Olazábal but by Francisco Ceverio and José María Alberdi. Real Cuesta 1985, pp. 190–1 When de Cerralbowhom Olazábal met in Pau late 1899, González Calleja 1998, p. 200 was rumored to resign, the press speculated it would be Olazábal replacing him.Fernández Escudero 2012, p. 373 As Sûreté reported arms purchases in London, Brussels, Paris and Switzerland, early 1900 Olazábal delivered 300 rifles from Bayonne across the Pyrenees before the French government bowed to pressure from MadridGonzález Calleja 1998, pp. 211–212 and in February ordered him to settle North of the Loire.González Calleja 1998, p. 207 Olazábal moved to Paris but appealed;claiming that he owned a property in Saint-Jean-de-Luz, had 11 children to take care of and was not subject to any legal action in Spain the Spanish embassy demanded rejection,González Calleja 1998, p. 207 though eventually they concluded he would be better watched in Saint-Jean-de- Luz.González Calleja 1998, p. 207; already in July 1899 the Spanish press claimed that the French ordered Olazábal to settle north of Loire, see El Globo 24.07.99, available here, but the news was denounced soon afterwards, see El Pais 25.07.99, available here In October the embassy changed their mind and demanded Olazábal's internment. Though the French indeed interned other Carlist conspirators,like Cavero and Costa, González Calleja 1998, p. 212 the Minister of Foreign Affairs Delcassé considered such action against a longtime legal inhabitant too violent.González Calleja 1998, p. 212 As the Spanish government feared diplomatic conflict in wake of the Deroulede affair, they backtracked.González Calleja 1998, pp. 212–3 Gras rifle breech When a series of minor Carlist insurrections rocked Catalonia in October 1900, Olazábal together with many Carlist bigwigs stayed in Parisit was Olazábal’s 8th month in the French capital, see El Imparcial 10.11.00, available here and declared himself utterly surprised.Fernández Escudero 2012, p. 394 Whether he was indeed remains unclear; though he contributed to military buildup and harbored political hopes related to potentially rebellious Spanish generals,Consuelo Sanz-Pastor y Fernandez de Pierola, El marqués de Cerralbo, politico carlista, [in:] Revista de archivos bibliotecas y museos 76 (1978), p. 259 scholars tend to assume that the rebels acted on their own and with no official order, if not clearly against it. Some partisan versions claimed that the affair was aimed at causing Madrid stock exchange perturbations.González Calleja 1998, p. 214 ==Early 1900s (The king is dead, long live the king)== The early 1900s are marked by relative Olazábal's inactivity; he is noted only for occasional Saint-Jean-de-Luz conferences with other Carlist leaders.Fernández Escudero 2012, p. 409 In pieces published by Spanish press envoys he was presented, “surrounded by his family”, as sort of a local tourist attraction.La Epoca 26.08.06, available here By this time, Villa Arbelaiz became the social center of Saint-Jean-de-Luz welcoming close friends and relatives of the Olazábal family and notable personalities associated with legitimists movements. Among its regular visitors were Don Jaime de Borbón, the former Queen Natalie of Serbia, the Countess of Bardi, Princes and Princesses of Bourbon-Parma, Italian aristocrats like the Counts Zileri Dal Verme and Emo Capodilista, the Duchess of Cadaval, the Counts O'Byrne of Corville and several Carlist politicians. During these years, Tirso and his family maintained their close relations with Carlos VII's family and were frequent visitors to the Palazzo Loredan in Venice. At least in 1905 he ventured to enter Spain, again accompanying Don Jaime during his visit to Covadonga.El Imparcial 15.08.95, available here; the news was even reported in women's fashion magazine La Ultima Moda, see here Also later he kept feeding the press with news about royal whereabouts,Heraldo de Madrid 19.02.06, available here but during the 1907 trip it was already his son Rafael accompanying Don Jaime.El Imparcial 09.08.07, available here. There was an interesting incident allegedly noted during a 1908 trip. A car with Alfonso XIII travelling North to Biarritz and a car with Don Jaime travelling South to Behovia met at a closed railway crossing near Urugne in France. While Don Jaime’s entourage, including Rafael de Olazábal and Julio de Urquijo, rose to pay their respect to member of the royal family, Don Jaime kept sitting and stared at Alfonso XIII, who did not know the Carlist prince. The train passed in-between, the crossing was opened and two vehicles parted each its own way. Referred after La Correspondencia Militar 30.07.08, available here It seems that his sons have already started to assume some of his tasks and it is indeed difficult to tell which Olazábal is referred to in various press notes from that period.compare the note on Carlist assembly in Guernica, El Liberal 05.07.09, available here Tirso is known to have exchanged vast correspondence with other Carlist leadersFernández Escudero 2012, p. 406 and upon death of the then Jefe Delegado Matías Barrio in 1909 he was invariably reported by the press as one of his potential successors; though the job went to Bartolomé Feliu instead.Fernández Escudero 2012, p. 422; many Carlists claimed that Feliu’s appointed was enforced by Bertha de Rohan “and her camarilla”. However, it is difficult to imagine Olazábal as Jefe Delegado. This role was created as the claimant, residing abroad, could hardly lead the party in Spain and needed his national representative. Since Olazábal resided in France, his appointment would defy this logic Olazábal couple visiting their king in Venice, 1904 Olazábal was among major Carlist figures at the funeral of Carlos VII in Varese in July 1909;El Imparcial 23.07.08, available here when republican unrest rocked Catalonia later that year, he resumed his now customary arms trafficking role serving the new claimant, Jaime III.as the crisis was unfolding in August Olazábal spoke in San Sebastián, see El Imparcial 23.07.09, available here; probably during the same visit he met Carlist bigwigs there, allegedly discussing changes in Carlist executive, Fernández Escudero 2012, p. 431 The French security claimed that the Carlists were involved in massive contraband,trafficking “100,000 armes” controlled by a team located in Saint-Jean-de-Luz.González Calleja 1998, p. 481 The French prime minister Briand estimated that 5–6,000 rifles were smuggled through Cerdanya only between December 1909 and February 1910.invariably, Olazábal was supposed to be the brain behind the operation; the French intelligence identified even the contraband routes, leading through Quillan, Aix-les- Termes, Cerdeña, Andorra, Saint-Jean-de-Luz, St Etienne de Beigorry and Hendaya, González Calleja 1998, p. 484 Contemporary scholars suspect that arms, including artillery pieces, originated mostly from England, with smaller amounts coming from Belgium, France and Austro-Hungary.González Calleja 1998, p. 484 Disguised as farming hardware, railway equipment, agricultural machines or even pianos,González Calleja 1998, pp. 484–5 having passed carabineros and guardias civiles on the Spanish side they were stored in Zumárraga, Alsasua and Tudela. Madrid demanded that the French tightly control Olazábal and his son-in-law, Julio de Urquijo e Ibarra.González Calleja 1998, p. 481 As Paris was upset with Olazábal's public criticism of the republican secular education system,González Calleja 1998, pp. 481–2; the claimant accused Olazábal of asking for trouble when interfering in French religious issues, Fernández Escudero 2012, p. 449 in October 1910 he was again ordered to move North of the Loire;under the threat of exulsion, La Epoca 07.10.10, available here his duties were taken over by Urquijo, permitted to stay in the South.González Calleja 1998, p. 481 It was only in May 1911 that he was allowed to come back to Labourd,La Correspondencia de España 16.05.11, available here, ABC 16.05.11, available here though some sources claim he was expulsed from France in 1912.In July 1912 the press reported him was from France, see La Correspondencia de España 06.07.12, available here; the French authorities were suspecting him of conspiring against the Portuguese government; Fernández Escudero 2012, p. 449 At that time another Carlist unrest, if indeed considered at any time, was nothing but a long gone illusion. ==Final years== Juan Vazquez de Mella In wake of the Ley del Candado crisis of 1910 Olazábal together with Fernando Manzanos became the Carlist representative in Comité Ejecutivo of a nationwide Catholic alliance.Cristóbal Robles, Cristóbal Robles Muñoz, José María de Urquijo e Ybarra: opinión, religión y poder, Madrid 1997, , 9788400076689, p. 270 Locally he joined not the Guipuzcoan, but the Biscay Junta de Defensa Católica;José Andres Gallego, La politica religiosa en España, Madrid 1975, p. 464 one source claims he intended to run or actually ran for Senate from Biscay in 1910, the information not confirmed elsewhere.Germán Cortabarría Igartua, Tirso de Olazabal Arbelaiz Lardizabal entry [in:] Auñamendi Eusko Entziklopedia At that time Juan Vázquez de Mella was clearly emerging as the top Carlist personality, engineering a scheme which would depose the then Jefe Delegado, Bartolomé Feliu, and replace him with de Mella's friend, the aging marqués de Cerralbo. Though Olazábal was not in the front row of the plotters,Olazábal is not mentioned in Juan Ramón de Andrés Martín, El caso Feliú y el dominio de Mella en el partido carlista en el período 1909–1912, [in:] Historia contemporánea 10 (1997), pp. 99–116 he sided with them and in 1911 wrote a letter to Jaime III, suggesting that de Cerralbo is nominated the new political leader.Fernández Escudero 2012, p. 439 In 1912 the claimant partially bowed to the pressure by creating an auxiliary collective junta, theoretically set to assist Feliu in his duties; within its structures, Olazábal was confirmed as jefe of the entire Vascongadas and La Rioja,Fernández Escudero 2012, p. 443 a move up the party structures from the previous provincial Guipuzcoan leadership. In early 1913, with Feliu removed already and under de Cerralbo's lead, there were 10 commissions formed within Junta Central Superior; Olazábal was nominated member of the electoral one.with Solferino and Francisco Martinez, Fernández Escudero 2012, p. 458 His career at this job did not last long; in July 1913 he resigned all posts within Carlism and announced his withdrawal from politics.Fernández Escudero 2012, p. 474 Carlist standard There is scarce information on Olazábal's public activity in the very last years of his life; indeed it is not clear whether he retired due to his age or due to political differences. Within Carlism he was still celebrated as a prestigious figure,La Epoca 20.07.14, available here though in 1917 he was reported as taking part in a local initiative clearly associated with Alfonso XIII and especially his wife Victoria.Tirso Olazábal formed part of a commission entrusted with planning a road from Azpeitia to the Loyola sanctuary, working under the auspices of Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg, wife of Alfonso XIII, which seemed rather unusual for a Carlist, see La Epoca 25.09.17, available here; in his 1921 obituary he was hailed for this very initiative by an Integrist daily, see La Constancia 26.11.21, available here Perhaps the sharpest political turn of his life came in 1919; when the long-developing conflict between de Mella and Jaime III escalated into secession of the so-called Mellistas, Olazábal supported the rebels. Having been a political retiree with no official duties, his gesture presented the secessionists with only a symbolic, prestigious gain. One source definitely claims he joined de Mella,see Idoia Estornés Zubizarreta, Victor Pradera Larumbe entry [in:] Auñamendi Eusko Entziklopedia available here; it is interesting that the same enciclopaedia does not mention this episode in the personal entry dedicated to Olazábal himself, see Cortabarría Igartua, Tirso de Olazabal Arbelaiz Lardizabal entry [in:] Auñamendi Eusko Entziklopedia another is less bold and suggests some ambiguity, though with preference for the rebels.José Luis Orella Martínez, El origen del primer Catolicismo social Español, [PhD thesis, Universidad de Educación a Distancia], Madrid 2012, pp. 182–3; he writes that “la posición de los notables no fue tan clara, Tirso Olazábal que se encontraba retirado de la vida pública, fue un ejemplo de notable local fiel al rey; sin embargo, su actitud le llevó esta vez a secundar a Vázquez de Mella. Guipuzcoanos, Vizcaínos y Catalanes fueron los que en mayoría formaron las huestes mellistas” Though mechanism behind the Mellist secession is rather well known in general,apart from minor articles covering the issue or paragraphs in synthethic works on Carlism, the most detailed monograph is Juan Ramón de Andrés Martín, El cisma mellista. Historia de una ambición política, Madrid 2000, none of the sources consulted offers any comment as to why, following almost 50 years of loyal service, Olazábal decided to abandon his king.and induced many to do so in Guipúzcoa, as the province turned into \\"principal baluarte de los mellistas\\", Andrés Martín 2000, pp. 160–161; it happened so even though de Mella did not hold Olazabal in high esteem, claiming that \\"mientras no desaparezcan de la escena politica Feliu, Olazabal, Forner y Polo nada podia hacerse\\", Andrés Martín 2000, p. 51 ==Guipuzcoan jefe: legacy== Guipúzcoa Olazábal was heading Guipuzcoan Carlism between 1887 and 1908,in 1908 the provincial jefatura was ceded to José María de Orbe y Gaytán de Ayala, 5th Marqués of Valde-Espina, El Correo Español 01.07.08, available here, though as regional jefe Olazábal was Valde-Espina's superior until 1913 during the period of dramatic social, economic and political change in the province. Some authors claim that his leadership style had enormous impact on Basque Carlism and contributed to final fate of the movement in the Vascongadas.Real Cuesta 1985, pp. 155–8 Though he resided outside the province,his counter-candidate as head of Guipuzcoan Carlism, Ramón Altarriba y Villanueva, the 4th largest landholder in Guipúzcoa, also lived outside the province, residing permanently in Madrid; it remains interesting that while according to the Carlist fuerista principles his place of residence disqualified him as a potential Guipuzcoan jefe—see Real Cuesta 1985, pp. 242–43—things did not work this way in case of Olazábal Olazábal tended to run the Carlist provincial affairs single-handedly. In theory, he should have been assisted by Junta Provincial; though formally created in 1889,Olazábal was the president, Antonio de Elósegui and José de Muguruza were nominated vice- presidents, Ramón Ortiz de Zarate was appointed the secretary and 5 district sub-delegates were members, Real Cuesta 1985, pp. 145–6 Olazábal has never assembled this body.at least in the 19th century, Real Cuesta 1985, p. 140 When de Cerralbo strove to build in-depth party structures nationwide, Guipúzcoa was one of the least-dynamic provinces;Olazábal opened new circles jointly with de Cerralbo, which might be indicative as to who was the moving spirit, Fernández Escudero 2012, p. 205 the number of local juntas grew from 59 in 1892 to 87 in 1896, mere 47% growth rate compared to 63% of Biscay and 257% of Álava.Real Cuesta 1985, p. 147 In 1899 there were fewer juntas in Guipúzcoa than in the Alicante province, hardly known for its Traditionalist zeal.Francisco Javier Caspistegui, Historia por descubrir. Materiales para estudio del carlismo, Estella 2012, , pp. 32–33 Olazábal did not appreciate modern means of political mobilisation introduced by de Cerralbo, commenting that his pompous trips across the country served no purpose but arrests of Carlist supporters.Fernández Escudero 2012, pp. 189, 263, Real Cuesta 1985, p. 139 Olazábal's position versus rebellious Guipuzcoan Carlist branches was somewhat ambiguous. On the one hand, he was adamant ensuring full loyalty to the king and expulsing either those suspected of siding with rebellious Nocedal in 1888–1889 or evicting Victor Pradera and his collaborators in 1910.in May 1910 as Jefe of Vascongadas he expulsed Pradera, José Joaquín Castañeda and Félix Erviti as those staging unauthorised Casteneda’s candidature for the Cortes, El Siglo Futuro 03.05.10, available here, also Juan Ramón de Andrés Martin, Precedentes del proyecto ultraderechista mellista en el periodo 1900–1912, [in:] Boletin de la Real Academia de la Historia 202 (2005), pp. 124–125 On the other hand, he was rather flexible as to forging electoral alliances with the Integrists; it was the Guipuzcoan 1898 accord which ended the decade of hostility and inspired collaboration also in other provinces.Jose María Remirez de Ganuza López, Las Elecciones Generales de 1898 y 1899 en Navarra, [in] Príncipe de Viana 49 (1988), p. 384 In terms of political strength measured by the number of Cortes mandates won, during Olazábal's tenure Guipúzcoa (9 mandates) was second only to Navarre (28); measured as ratio between seats won and seats available Guipuzcoan Carlists achieved a 20% success ratio,9 seats won out of 45 available in 9 successive elections taking place during Olazábals Guipuzcoan tenure compared to 44% in Navarre28 seats out of 63 and 19% in Álava.5 seats out of 27 By all means the province remained the Carlist national stronghold.it is not clear who succeeded Olazábal as the provincial party jefe; in the late 1910s it was Bernardo Elío y Elío who started to represent Gipuzkoa on various nationwide party gatherings Golden Fleece, 1910 Though Olazábal commenced his political activity under the “Dios y fueros” banner and though he protested to Carlist leaders against breaking with the foral tradition, he is not recognised as particularly concerned with regional rights. Some of his contemporarieslike José Liñán, director of the El Basco periodical described him as “aforal” (though not “antiforal”).Real Cuesta 1985, p. 152 Present-day scholar claims that until the early 1880s Guipuzcoan Carlism was offering a clear Catholic and foral line. Later on, mostly due to stance of provincial leaders, the movement stalled in \\"political ossification\\", with \\"tradicionalismo foralista\\" replaced—thanks to influence of de Mella and Pradera—by \\"doctrina españolista\\";Real Cuesta 1985, pp. 155–8; even more far-reaching conclusions in Jiří Chalupa, En defensa del trono y del altar. El ideario carlista en el siglo XIX, [in:] Acta palackianae olomucensis. Romanica XIX. Philologica 93 (2007), p. 54: \\"Pero ideológicamente el carlismo muere ya a finales del siglo XIX\\" This resulted in Carlism failing to accommodate or to offer an alternative to the nascent Basque national movement.a different conclusion offered is that in Guipúzcoa like in Catalonia, local Carlism tended to work hand in hand with peripheral nationalisms, which in turned triggered a response in form of growing espanolismo, forming part of the Mellista political toolset, Andres Martin 2000, p. 255 Though Olazábal was related to José Ignacio Arana,Jose Ignacio de Arana, Francisco María Altuna Bengoechea, Aita Aranaren egunaria, Bilbo 2000, , p. 51 he probably failed to understand what process was at work when Daniel Irujo handed his resignation in 1908.Jordi Canal, ¿En busca del precedente perdido?: tríptico sobre las complejas relaciones entre carlismo y catalanismo a fines del siglo XIX, [in:] Historia y Politica 14 (2005), p. 66 He had even less understanding of the Basque workers’ movement, which he firmly opposed like during the 1912 gathering in Eibar, ending in riots.Mundo Grafico 17.04.12, available here; the meeting was called in Eibar, centre of Basque socialism and republicanism, following earlier riots with two fatalities, including one Carlist, Antxon Narbaiza Azkue, Akilino Amuategi (1877–1919): XX. mende hasierako mitinlari sozialista euskalduna, Eibar 2002, , 9788489696310, pp. 68–69 ==In literature== Tirso de Olazábal appears in the Fifth Series (Spain Without a King) of Benito Pérez Galdós's Episodios Nacionales. It is also possible that Olazábal has also been acknowledged in world literature; the 1919 novel of Joseph Conrad, The Arrow of Gold, features a person referred to as \\"Lord X\\", whose activities as arms smuggler resemble those of Olazábal.Conrad himself claimed to have smuggled arms for the Carlists along the Mediterranean coast, but there are conflicting views on authenticity of these accounts; some doubt it, see Zdzisław Najder, Życie Conrada-Korzeniowskiego, Warszawa 1980, , pp. 45-50, and some accept it, see Marek Jan Chodakiewicz, Affinity and Revulsion: Poland reacts to the Spanish Right (1936-1939), [in:] Marek Jan Chodakiewicz, John Radzilowski (eds.), Spanish Carlism and Polish Nationalism: The Borderlands of Europe in the 19th and 20th Centuries, Charlottesville 2003, , p. 48.

She was placed in a workhouse at Great Yarmouth at the age of 55 and there she created several pieces of needlework which have been featured on BBCTV and which can now be found in the Norwich Castle Museum. The needlework are long expressionist samplers which document her anger and indignation during that time in her life. ==Life== Bulwer was born in 1838 in a small town of Beccles located in Suffolk. Her parents were William John Bulwer and Ann Bulwer (born Turner). Some time before 1861 her family moved to Great Yarmouth.Looking for Lorina, Ruth Burwood, frayedtextilesontheedge exhibition, retrieved 12 April 2015 Her father died in 1871 and she then worked running a guest house until her mother died in 1893. She is thought to have been placed in Great Yarmouth Workhouse by her brother Edgar shortly after and he would have paid to leave her there. The workhouse had 500 inmates, including about 60, like Lorina, who had mental disorders and were classified as \\"lunatics\\". They would have unpicked oakum for up to 10 hours a day. Bulwer embroidered long messages that can read as a letters of protest or outrage. The material is cotton and it has been embroidered with different colour wools.An Extraordinary Long Sampler, Christies auction, retrieved 14 April 2015 One of the letters is twelve feet long and the other is . The text is all in upper case and lacks any punctuation. In her rants she tries to connect her family with the Bulwer- Lyttons of Knebworth House or the Royal family or the Bulwer family of Heydon Hall. Some of the parts of her message can be verified as they refer to real people. At other points she talks about fantasies of being related to the Royal family. At other times she hints that she was sexually abused – \\"I MISS LORINA BULWER WAS EXAMINED BY DR PINCHING OF WALTHAMSTOW ESSEX AND FOUND TO BE A PROPERLY SHAPED FEMALE\\". Dr. Richard Lloyd Pinching of Walthamstow, Essex, was implicated in the sexual abuse of a fourteen-year-old girl in early 1859, in what was then called the \\"Walthamstow Scandal\\". Bulwer died of influenza on 5 March 1912 and she was buried close to the workhouse. ==Legacy== The text is all in uppercase and lacks any punctuation The needlework that she created went into private ownership and at one time was for sale in the local market. One of Lorina's needleworks was sold in 2002 for just over £1800 when it was thought it might have been made by Rosina Bulwer Lytton about her husband. Lorina's work is now in Norwich Castle Museum where the curators refer to her work as \\"Lorina\\". The museum bought the first part of her needlework in 2004. It was later discovered that there was a similar embroidery by Bulwer in the Thackray Museum that was dated to be two years later than the first. It was possible to date the embroideries as Bulwer made references to real events like the death of a fellow inmate. The Dr Pinching of Walthamstow referred to in the embroideries was initially thought to be untraceable, but his story was finally uncovered in 2015 by genealogist Penelope Hemingway. Dr Pinching was involved in a court case where a man he was tending too was alleged to have torn up his will and Pinching's account was questioned. During this investigation he explained the circumstance which had happened before he resigned from the Infant Orphan Asylum in Walthamstow in 1859. He said that he had written letters to a \\"15 year old girl\\" and then he had been asked by the family to seduce her as he said he was the \\"family's intimate friend\\". No charges were brought against him when he resigned. Bulwer's needlework was discussed during series 36 of the Antiques RoadshowAntiques Roadshow, series 36, BBC and later they were featured in a spin-off program called Antiques Roadshow Detective.

He is also the current Chairperson of the HIV/AIDS and Social Commentary (HASC) committee of the Zambia Association of Musicians (ZAM). He is the global ambassador in the fight against HIV/AIDS for the American organization AIDS Healthcare Foundation (AHF) and also the first Zambian artist to launch an album at the US Embassy. The event was sponsored by the United States government through the embassy. The stage name B Flow was inspired by people who loved his 'flow'. B Flow also took a new direction with his music, changing his genre to what is now known as “KaliDanceHall” (A mix of traditional Zambian Kalindula music and Dance Hall). In November 2016, the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) named B Flow as one of the 16 voices of activism against gender-based violence around the world. == Early life== Young Brian getting ready for school. Bwembya was born in Kabwe and raised by his grandmother Matilda Chiti-Byrne and his mother Mirriam Mulenga Mumba Byrne, a policewoman. His father Mathews \\"Mizzy\\" Kasoka was a football coach for Kabwe Warriors football club. B flow comes from a family of renowned Zambian musicians like Chris Mbewe of The Great Witch Band, Anna Mwale of The Mwale Sisters and Ras Willie . B Flow's grandmother Matilda was a teacher by profession and she taught him how to read and write English which then became his favourite subject. When he was 6 years old, he enrolled at Kasanda Malombe Primary School. In 2nd Grade, he joined the Boy Scouts. He left the club shortly after and became a basketball player which he played for fun for about 7years. At 8, he and his friends played a small band by turning pots and buckets into drums and making Banjos(non-electric guitars) using tins, planks and strings. In 4th Grade, Brian and his mother moved to Serenje with where he joined the poetry club at Serenje Boma School. The following year, Brian learned how to beat the African drum and became a drummer and singer in the school cultural group. He was also one of the only two male dancers in the group. At the age of 11 he started listening to reggae music a collection that his mom owned and his love for reggae music started to grow with likes of Bob Marley being hits of his early childhood. In 7th Grade, B Flow and his brother were transferred back to Kabwe where they attended Broadway Primary and Basic School and he was always punished for singing and drumming in class by his class teacher at his new school. At age 13, he formed a group called Natty Boys how ever the group only performed at one party and disbanded because B Flow was the only member who had the ability to compose songs and the confidence to sing in front of people, while the rest of the members were shy. He then formed Hot Kays which consisted of B Flow and Zed Pride's Ron Kay, the duo dedicated their time learning the art of song writing, rhyming and arranging lyrics B Flow then known as Attic B, specialised in Rap and Ragga while Ron Kay specialised in R&B.; Bemba During his 10 Grade at Kabwe High School Brian joined the Anti-AIDS/Drug Club the same year, where he actively participated in quiz and singing. In 3rd term of Grade 10, Brian was elected vice president for the Anti-AIDS/Drug Club because of his dedication to counselling his fellow pupils who used to smoke Marijuana and drink alcohol. Brian mobilized new members and taught the club about HIV and drugs. He also raised awareness on HIV/AIDS through song and led the club during candlelight walks and visits to AIDS hospices.

Madison was elected to the parliament in 2015 election with 1883 votes. In April 2017, he was elected as the deputy chairman of the party. In 2019 he was elected as a Member of the European Parliament with 22 819 votes. == Political Views == Madison holds national conservative views.  European Union  Madison has said that the European Union should return to its original form, that of an union for economic and trade cooperation between sovereign states. He has said that a federalized European Union is the greatest threat to nation states. Madison has claimed that the European Union is already on its way to becoming a federal state, as member states lack many of the features of an independent state. Madison has opposed the idea of a European Union Minister for Finance , saying that issues such as government budget and immigration must be left to the member states. He has argued against qualified majority voting, saying that it deprives smaller countries of decision-making power on issues .  Foreign Policy and Border Agreement with Russia  Madison has said Estonia must withdraw from the border agreement between Estonia and Russia and start new talks on the basis of the Treaty of Tartu. In 2018, Madison said that if the border treaty is ratified under the current conditions, Russia could claim that the Treaty of Tartu is no longer legally valid . He has opposed defense cooperation and security policy with France or Germany, and in favour of cooperation with the other Baltic states, Poland, Hungary, the United States and Finland. In 2018, in the foreign policy magazine Diplomaatia, Madison named supporting and keeping in touch with Estonian communities abroad as a key issue for the survival of Estonia, which should not be compromised for realpolitical reasons. Madison also took this view on the issue of Estonians in Crimea, arguing that the occupation of Crimea by Russia must not mean that Estonia no longer supports Estonians living there. He stated that Estonia must pursue a value-based foreign policy, which means that any Estonian living anywhere in the world is important to Estonia and we should do everything in our power to keep their ties with Estonia.  Immigration and Citizenship  Madison believes that mass immigration does not affect Estonia. In January 2019, he said that a low immigration quota (up to 1300 people a year) was not a problem because there was free movement of labor in the European Union and an increase in the immigration quota would be only for cheap labor, which would lower local wages. Madison supports not having a quota for highly skilled workers who earn triple the average wage. In 2018, he expressed the view that those with Estonian alien's passport who have lived in Estonia since 1991 should be given five years to decide what citizenship they want. Those who do not acquire Estonian citizenship during this period will have their residence permit revoked.  Social Issues  Madison is against the legalization of same-sex cohabitation, the right of same-sex couples to adopt, national facilitation of gender reassignment and abortion outside of certain cases. He supports the reinstatement of the death penalty for serious crimes and believes surrogacy should be made illegal. ==Controversy== Blog posts In March 2015, media reported about Madison’s blog post which defended the economic aspects of the Nazi regime. He had written: \\"It is true that there were concentration camps, forced labour camps, games with gas chambers were being played, but at the same time such a 'strict' order brought Germany at the time out of a thorough shithole, because development, that admittedly concentrated primarily on the development of the military industry, brought the country only within a couple of years to one of the most powerful in Europe.\\" His blog post further claimed that while Madison did not seek to justify Nazi mass murders, he nonetheless felt that the Holocaust had 'positive aspects'. The media also cited his comments from spring 2014 that \\"It is unfortunately a fact that only now it is being more widely understood and recognized that a national purification is needed, that would create premises that exactly those pro-Estonian ones would gain superiority among the Russians\\". This was largely condemned by public and the Reform Party, which left EKRE out of the coalition talks. The PM Taavi Rõivas pointed out it was causing him grief that a young politician treated Nazism that had caused so much suffering to people in a justifying manner and wondered, whether sugarcoating fascism and ridiculing crimes against humanity was a general line of Madison's party. Incidents Madison raised controversy again later in March, when he was fined for retaining a passenger’s lost smartphone, which he should have placed in \\"lost and found\\" and selling it online while working for ferry company Tallink. In April, some female workers of Tallink also accused Madison of sexual harassment and sexual assault. Tallink launched an internal investigation of the incidents, whilst Madison called the accusations absurd.  Views  He has labelled gay people as deviants. In May 2019, during an interview with The Guardian, he did not disown his earlier views from 2015 about praising the \\"positive aspects\\" Nazi Germany - his explanation being, that \\"pushing people to camps was wrong\\", but the unemployment rate \\"was low\\". In August 2019, Madison used the term \\"Final Solution\\" within the context of Syrian refugees, using the phrase \\"Die endgültige Lösung ist erforderlich.\\". The same phrase was used in Nazi Germany, which caused the action to make headlines. Madison protected the saying, claiming he doesn't want the Holocaust or concentration camps, but an end to the refugee crisis. ==References== Category:1991 births Category:Living people Category:People from Järva Parish Category:Conservative People's Party of Estonia politicians Category:Members of the Riigikogu Category:MEPs for Estonia 2019–2024 Category:Conservative People's Party of Estonia MEPs Category:European white nationalists Category:Holocaust deniers Category:Critics of Islam Category:21st-century Estonian politicians ","title":"Jaak Madison"},{"id":"46383957","text":"Werner Pledath (26 April 1898 – 6 December 1965) was a German actor who appeared in many films during a lengthy career.

The title refers to the \\"Green Devils\\", Germany's World War II paratroopers. ==Plot summary== Summer, 1943. After long and arduous duty at the Eastern Front, the 1. Fallschirmjägerdivision is dropped off by parachute at Avignon for recuperation. Several paratroopers are injured during the jump, including Oberjäger Karl Christiansen, a former infantry Fähnrich who detests the war and was demoted for refusing to execute a captured enemy soldier. At the hospital he meets Inge, a nurse, and the two fall in love. However, Reiter, an Oberleutnant of the division, has taken a fancy on Inge as well. Right after their arrival, the paratroopers and Inge's hospital corps are re-assigned to combat duty in Italy. They receive the order to occupy and secure the area of Monte Cassino, including the nearby town, but not the monastery at the top of the hill, which is meant to shelter the evacuated townspeople and historical art treasures from the surrounding communities. Soon the Allies mount an attack campaign on their position. Upon learning about the art treasures stored in the abbey, Oberstleutnant Julius Schlegel, about to be sent back home for heart issues, decides on his own initiative to save the priceless artefacts, and after much arguing convinces the abbot to permit their evacuation to Rome into the custody of the Vatican. However, Allied radio propaganda claims that the Germans are in fact plundering the treasures, and the news quickly spreads among the Cassino townspeople and German command. Still, despite the threat of arrest and execution, Schlegel's division commander officially grants him permission and support for the operation. In the meantime, Karl and Reiter reunite with Inge, of whose presence they have just learned, which sparks jealously in the Oberleutnant. Additionally, partisan activity has increased against the alleged plundering. The final transport is to commence the following night, with Karl assigned as an escort and Inge going along to request medical supplies. For intercepting the convoy, local resistance member Fausto asks his friend Gina to retrieve a submachine gun from its hiding place in her house, which is occupied by Reiter. Reiter catches her in the act, and in order to avoid suspicion, Gina sleeps with him, but then Reiter finds the gun and forces Gina to confess. Then he and the rest of the division arrive to thwart a resistance attack on the convoy, and Fausto is captured. Reiter orders Karl to execute him, but Karl only pretends to do so, letting Fausto go. In return for this gesture, Fausto stops the resistance from conducting further attacks, and the convoy safely delivers its precious cargo to the Vatican. In February the next year, a major Allied attack commences, in whose course the abbey is hit and destroyed by Allied bombs. Most of the civilian survivors - excluding Inge, Gina (forcibly made Reiter's mistress) and several wounded and children - evacuate the ruins, which are then used by the German paratroopers as a fortified position. Gina loses her life in an artillery barrage, and the next night Reiter is killed while on his way to a remotedly stationed battalion. The German defenders are eventually overwhelmed and Monte Cassino captured by the Allies. Karl and Inge both survive the war and, after its conclusion, visit the graves of the fallen at the foot of the fully restored monastery. ==CastProduction== The film was shot at the Bavaria Studios in Munich.

The church occupies a position on rising ground overlooking the river Severn and is to the north east of Newtown. The present church was rebuilt in 1816. In 2011 the medieval carved screen, originally from St Mary's church in Newtown, was re- positioned in Llanllwchaiarn church == Saint Llwchaiarn == The Church is dedicated to the 6th-century Saint Llwchaiarn or Lluwchaiarn, who was also the patron saint of the adjacent parish if Llanmerewig and of two parishes in Ceredigion.Bartrum P C \\"A Welsh Classical Dictionary\\" National Library of Wales, 1993, 419 The 16th-century local Welsh poet, Siôn Ceri describes the various feats and miracles attributed to the saint which include slaying a dragon and causing a hind to leap into a pool of water, but there is very little certain evidence about the life of the saint.Baring-Gould S and Fisher J \\"Lives of the British Saints\\" 4vols, London 1907–13. ==Earlier History and setting of the Church== In recent times the churchyard has been extended, but the original churchyard, is a raised area that is almost circular, and contains many historic yew trees. The combination of a church within an almost circular churchyard and an early dedication would suggest that it was founded in the 6th or 7th centuries. The church is recorded in the Norwich Taxation of 1254 as 'Ecc'a de Llanlocharen' with a value of £1 6s 8d. In 1263 part of it was appropriated to the Cistercian nunnery at Llanllugan, and in 1291 the combined value was £4 6s 8d.\\"Thomas\\", Vol 1, 513. John Ingleby's Views of the Church, 1796 Llanllwchaiarn Church by John Ingleby 1796 In the 1790s Thomas Pennant commissioned John Ingleby to produce a series of watercolours for a revised version of his Tour in Wales. The watercolours are now in the collections of the National Library of Wales. Llanllwchaiarn Church In 1795 Pennant commissioned two watercolors from John Ingelby of Llanllwchaiarn Church. These two illustrations of the parish church, before it was re-built in 1815 appear to be the only ones in existence. The old church was an example of a church with an internally supported bell tower. The first view shows the church from the south and looking across the river Severn and the second shows the church from the North.  Re-building of the Church  St Llwchaiarn's church, Llanllwchaiarn. Window by Morris & Co. St Llwchaiarn's church, Llanllwchaiarn, Datestone 1815. The present church was built on the old site in 1815 at a cost of £1,200. The re-built church was a simple Georgian brick church with a square tower was built and in 1864 a chancel and vestry were added1. Recently, the fine carved Medieval rood screen from the old church at Newtown, that had been moved to St David's Church, was moved again to Llanllwchaiarn. Further restoration work, which included the eastern extension of the chancel and vestry and the insertion of the bench seating, was completed by R.J.Withers in 1865 at a cost of £460. The original east wall of the church was cut through and the plain yellow sandstone chancel arch erected; the stonework was designed and executed by Edward Jones of Newtown. The round headed windows were also altered to the Gothic style and stained glass windows have been inserted, including one by Morris & Co. Screen from St Mary's Church, Newtown. In 2011 the medieval carved screen of c.1500, originally from St Mary's church in Newtown, was re-positioned in Llanllwchaiarn church. Fenton thought the screen was perhaps the most perfect thing of the kind in the kingdom and the Rev John Parker described it in 1829 as a world of Gothic art…..with the highest luxuries of workmanship and colouring. The largest part of the screen to survive is a length with five bays to either side of the Tudor arched door, its spandrels with cusped circles. Double ogee tracery heads make an inventive display of circles, quatrefoils and wheels. The bressumer has intricate trails of running ornament, incorporating leaf designs, together with flower, vine, pomegranate and seaweed.the carving is still coloured in gold, red and green.

He resigned his seat on July 10, 2020. ==Background== Hodges is a former resident of Ozark in Christian County in southwestern Missouri, where he graduated from high school. In 2012, he was named a finalist for a Harry S. Truman Scholarship while a student in the Honors College of the J. William Fulbright College of Arts and Sciences at the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville. He was the chairman of the Senate for the UA Associated Student Government. He was also the youngest member of the Fayetteville Parks and Recreation Committee, which earmarks spending from the municipal beautification fee. In 2013, Hodges received his bachelor's degree in Political Science from the University of Arkansas. He was an intern that summer for the Heritage Foundation with special study in the field of health care. He is a member of the National Rifle Association. He is a Baptist. In college he worked in the successful campaigns in 2010 to elect Republicans John Boozman to the U.S. Senate and Mark Darr as lieutenant governor. ==Political activities== In 2014, Hodges entered the Republican primary to choose a successor to the term-limited Duncan Baird of Lowell, Arkansas, who subsequently joined the administration of Republican Governor Asa Hutchinson as the budget director. Hodges won the nomination, 1,395 (69 percent) to 635 (31 percent) for Damon Dale Wallace of Gateway. The youthful Hodges carried the backing of State Senators Bart Hester and Cecile Bledsoe and the elderly former U.S. Representative John Paul Hammerschmidt of Arkansas's 3rd congressional district, who subsequently died on April 1, 2015. Hodges was only two years old when Hammerschmidt retired from Congress. In the November 4 general election, Hodges with 4,330 votes (59 percent), prevailed over Democrat Tom McClure, who polled 2,605 votes, and the Libertarian Michael J. Kalagias of Garfield in Benton County, who held the remaining 375 ballots. Hodges was assigned to the House committees on: (1) Education and (2) Insurance and Commerce. In February 2015, Hodges supported House Bill 1228, sponsored by Bob Ballinger of Carroll County, which sought to prohibit government from imposing a burden on the free exercise of religion. The measure passed the House, 72–20. The measure was subsequently passed by a large margin in the House and signed into law in revised form, SB 975, by Governor Hutchinson. Hodges also supported legislation which allows public school teachers to withdraw memberships from labor unions at any time of their choosing, rather than making an irrevocable annual decision each August. ==References== Category:1990 births Category:Living people Category:People from Ozark, Missouri Category:Politicians from Fayetteville, Arkansas Category:People from Rogers, Arkansas Category:People from Benton County, Arkansas Category:University of Arkansas alumni Category:American political consultants Category:Baptists from Arkansas Category:Members of the Arkansas House of Representatives Category:Arkansas Republicans Category:21st-century American politicians ","title":"Grant Hodges"},{"id":"46384049","text":"Swiss Tour (or Four Days Leave) is a 1949 American-Swiss drama film directed by Leopold Lindtberg and starring Cornel Wilde, Josette Day and Simone Signoret.

It has been found on the eastern coast of Brazil, in 1989, but was not identified until 2000. As of the summer of 2012, 23 specimens of B. koilomatodon have been collected along the coast of Brazil, all specimens were collected at six different locations along the coast. Biologists have been able to identify 17 of the specimens as male, four as female, and two more were not able to be sexed. And many of the specimens were in different stages of maturity, a breeding population is likely to be established, but enough data are collected to conclude it finally. How this species got to the other side of the continent of South America is unclear. Many believe they were brought over in the ballast tanks of ships. The small size of the species makes it very easy for them to enter the intake holes on a ship's ballast tank. Also, their ability to tolerate a wide range of salinity levels, as well as temperature fluctuations, makes it likely for them to inhabit a ballast tank on journeys across the ocean. ==References== Category:Fish of China Category:Fauna of Rivers State Category:Fish described in 1849 koilomatodon ","title":"Butis koilomatodon"},{"id":"46384052","text":"Butis humeralis, commonly known as the dark sleeper or olive flathead-gudgeon, is a fish native to the waters of Indonesia and Indochina.

It is a catadromous species which is native to the Indo-Pacific and northern Australia. ==Description== Kuhlia rupestris has a compressed body which is moderately deep. It has a pointed head with an oblique, protractible mouth and a large eye. It has a deeply notched dorsal fin and an emarginate caudal fin with relatively rounded lobes. This species is brown to olive in colour on its upperparts, silvery on the flanks and white on the belly and breast. The flanks are marked with numerous dusky or red-brown spots and the tail is marked with a black blotch on each lobe of the caudal fin. The scales are cycloid. In older fish the tail blotches may become fused to form a vertical bar. The dorsal fin has 10 spines and 10-12 soft rays while the anal fin has 3 spines and 9-11 soft rays. ==Distribution== Kuhlia rupestris has a wide distribution in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. It occurs off eastern Africa from Somalia south to South Africa and across the Indian Ocean into the western Pacific borth to the Ryukyu Islands of Japan and south to Australia. In the Pacific it reaches as far east as Fiji, Samoa and the Caroline Islands. In Australia it is found in the Gulf of Carpentaria, Cape York south to the Tallebudgera Creek in southern Queensland. ==Habitat and biology== Kuhlia rupestris is found in fast flowing freshwater streams and rivers normally within rainforest but it also occurs in estuaries and inshore coastal waters up to an altitude of . It is frequently recorded from rocky pools below waterfalls It is a migrant which has to move from freshwaters into the sea to spawn and it is thought that they follow flood plumes out to sea in the wet season and spawn en masse at the margins of these plumes. The sperm produced by males of K. rupestris are not motile in fresh or brackish water. They need to migrate to freshwater to complete their life cycle. They are omnivorous fish which feed on insects, crustaceans and small fishes as well as on fallen fruit, especially figs. ==Conservation== Kuhlia rupestris is a sought after species by anglers, especially as it is regarded as a quick learner and learns to avoid lures. Queensland has a bag limit on this species. It has a wide range and is assessed as Least Concern by the IUCN. However, it is threatened by habitat degradation. Dams and impoundmets block riverchannels and reduce the availability of habitat and resulted in reduced populations and extrpation in some waters. ==References * Fishes of Australia : Kuhlia rupestris rock flagtail Category:Marine fish of Northern Australia rock flagtail ","title":"Kuhlia rupestris"},{"id":"46384076","text":"Terapon theraps, the largescaled terapon, banded grunter, banded trumpeter, flagtail grunter, flagtail trumpeter, large-scaled grunter-perch, Northern grunter and spiky trumpeter, is a species of marine ray-finned fish, a grunter from the family Terapontidae. This species has a wide distribution in the Indo-Pacific region. ==Description== Terapon theraps is a medium sized species of grunter which has an oblong body which shows moderate lateral compression. The jaws are of equal length and the mouth is slightly oblique, gape slightly oblique. In juveniles the maxilla is set level with the front of the eyes, it doesn't reach the eye in adults. The teeth are conical in shape and are arranged in villiform bands with the outermost row greatly enlarged. There are no teeth on the roof of the mouth. The dorsal fin has 11 o 12 spines and 9 to 11 soft rays, the spiny part is notably arched and has a deep notch. The third to the sixth dorsal fin spines are the longest and the notch is created by the second last spine being around half the length of the last spine. The anal fin has three spines and 7-9 soft rays, the longest spine being the third and this is longer than the longest ray, The caudal fin has a shallow fork and rounded lobes. The lateral line contains 46-56 pored scales. This species is mainly dusky-green in colour with has a green iridescence which fades to silver-white on the belly. There are four broad dark, horizontal stripes along the flanks, a big black spot on the dorsal fin and dusky stripes on the tail. The juveniles are brown in colour and their stripes are darker and have white spots which run in lines in the paler areas between the dark stripes and they have a striped tail. This species attains a maximum total length of . ==Distribution== Terapon theraps is a widespread species in the Indo-Pacific region being found from the southern Red Sea and along the eastern coast of Africa as far south as Madagascar and eastwards along the southern Asian coasts, including the Seychelles, and into the Pacific Ocean where it reaches as far north as southern Japan and south to Australia and east to New Caledonia. It has been recorded twice in the Mediterranean, once of Istria in the northern Adriatic Sea and once of Halkidiki in the Aegean Sea, as this species is not found in the northern Red Sea and the records are from more northerly areas of the Mediterranean well away from the Suez Canal it is thought that these records are of fish either transported by ships in ballast water or deliberate releases. It is also thought that these waters are too cold for this species to become established. ==Habitat and biology== Terapon theraps is a species of inshore waters in the tropics of the Indo-Pacific and it is common in brackish waters and among mangroves.

In 1929 she appeared as Erika, the friend of Thymian (Louise Brooks), in G. W. Pabst's critically acclaimed film Diary of a Lost Girl. Her transition to sound film went smoothly, and Edith Meinhard played a wide range of supporting roles, including prostitutes, secretaries and maids, until the outbreak of the war in 1939. Edith Meinhard's last film was made in the spring of 1943, shortly before the heavy Allied bombing of Berlin began.

Some fish may also be brown or gray with either yellow or blue spots on their bodies. The max length a Nuchequula gerreoide can grow is 12.5 centimeters. == Environment == Nuchequula gerreoides live in coastal waters in a depth of 10 to 30 meters. They are commonly found in estuaries, which is where the tide of the river meets the sea. Nuchequula gerreoides are demersal fish, which means that they normally live close to the floor in seas or lakes. They periodically migrate from salt water to fresh water, this is a process called amphidromous. Generally, fish that do this migrate for breeding purposes, but the cause of their migration is unknown. == Diet == The diet of Nuchequula gerreoides depends on their size. If the fish are smaller, approximately less than 6.9 centimeters, their diet would consist of small crustaceans. If the fish are bigger, approximately greater than 7.0 centimeters, their diet would consist of amphipods, polychaetes, and detritus. == Reproduction == Fertilization for these fish takes place outside the body. The eggs are either released in open water or scattered beneath the surface of the sea floor.

In 1886 Ramsay and Ogilby described what turned out to the same species from Hood Lagoon in Papua New Guinea, naming it Leiognathus smithursti. In 2008, ichthyologists Prosanta Chakrabarty and John S. Sparks resurrected the genus Aurigequula and placed L. longispinis and L. fasciatus in it, on the basis of a horizontal row of yellow markings on their flanks and elongated second spine of the dorsal fin. However, a molecular study showed that the genus Leiognathus was nested within Aurigequula, and hence the genera were merged once more. It is unclear whether the longspine ponyfish as currently defined represents a single or more than one species. The longspine ponyfish reaches a total length of . It is distinguished by a long spine on both its dorsal and anal fin. Found to depths of around , the longspine ponyfish forages on the sea floor, generally in murky environs, consuming fish, crustaceans, arrow worms, nematodes, and shellfish such as bivalves, and gastropods. Like all members of the ponyfish family, the longspine ponyfish is bioluminescent.

In Queensland, Northern Territory, and other parts of Australia, it is perhaps known more commonly as fingermark bream, and is arguably one of the best estuarial eating fish. The former name (golden snapper) is generally used when the fish is in much larger sizes, with juveniles and young adults usually referred to as the latter (fingermark). It has a remarkably slow growth rate, so release is encouraged and bag limits apply. It can grow to about 8 kg in weight, although 10-kg fish have been recorded off the coast of Cairns, though even a small individual provides a substantial fight. They are not recommended to be targeted for catch and release when fishing in depths of 10 m or over, as the species is highly susceptible to barotrauma. Fingermark encounters often occur when targeting other species such as barramundi, and can be distinguished by their golden- brown to reddish skin tint and dark \\"finger mark\\" beneath the dorsal fin – colourations both lost as the species dies once taken from the water or grows in size. Colourations are extremely prominent in juvenile fish. They are members of the snapper genus Lutjanus, which also includes mangrove jack and other well-known table species. ==References * Fishes of Australia : Lutjanus johnii John's snapper Category:Marine fish of Northern Australia John's snapper ","title":"Lutjanus johnii"},{"id":"46384194","text":"Lutjanus indicus is a fish native to the Indian Ocean. ==References== Category:Fish of Thailand Category:Fish described in 2013 Category:Fish of the Indian Ocean indicus ","title":"Lutjanus indicus"},{"id":"46384195","text":"Lutjanus decussatus, commonly known as the checkered snapper, is a marine fish native to the western Pacific and Indian Oceans, from Sri Lanka to New Guinea. ==References * Category:Fish of Indonesia Category:Fish of Thailand Category:Fish of Sri Lanka Category:Fish of New Guinea Category:Fish described in 1828 Category:Fish of the Pacific Ocean Category:Fish of the Indian Ocean decussatus ","title":"Lutjanus decussatus"},{"id":"46384196","text":"Lutjanus carponotatus, the Spanish flag snapper also known as the gold-banded sea perch, is a marine fish native to the western Pacific and Indian Oceans, from India to northern Australia. ==References * Fishes of Australia : Lutjanus carponotatus * Spanish flag snapper Category:Marine fish of Northern Australia Spanish flag snapper ","title":"Lutjanus carponotatus"},{"id":"46384197","text":"Lutjanus biguttatus, commonly known as the two-spot banded snapper, is a marine fish native to the western Pacific and Indian Oceans, from the Maldives to the Philippines, Solomon Islands and northern Australia. ==References * Fishes of Australia : Lutjanus biguttatus * two-spot banded snapper Category:Fauna of Queensland two-spot banded snapper Category:Taxa named by Achille Valenciennes ","title":"Lutjanus biguttatus"},{"id":"46384200","text":"Robert Raymond Wilkinson (October 8, 1927 – September 12, 2016) was an American football end who played for the New York Giants.

She is the founder and CEO of addiction treatment centres in Burton-upon-Trent and Clayton, Staffordshire. ==Biography== She attended Christ the King Catholic Voluntary Academy, Nottinghamshire. She completed O-Levels in English, history, domestic science and science. She received a postgraduate degree in marketing from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. From 1975 to 1998, she worked in various positions and industries, including as a dental nurse, director of patient services at a private clinic, pharmaceutical representative, healthcare liaison worker in the community, and marketing manager and volunteer at the Nottingham Clinic. She began drinking at age 16 and suffered from alcoholism for years; her first alcohol detox treatment was at age 25. She recalls, \\"I was a functioning alcoholic. I held down two jobs. But towards the end there were emergency admissions to hospital. I had consultants screaming that I was going through liver failure.\\" By 1992, at age 31, she was drinking a bottle of gin a day and was hospitalised with cirrhosis. She was malnourished and weighed just ; her stomach was so shrunken that she was unable to eat. At one point she was so ill she was given last rites by a priest; after surviving, she vowed to turn her life around. She attempted detox nine times in total. After her near death experience, her family arranged for her to attend a rehabilitation clinic in Nottingham. She recalled, \\"I shared a room with a female crack addict who also worked the streets. This was a completely alien thing to me and, at first, I was horrified but soon realised she was not so different to me.\\" She stopped drinking completely in 1993. She soughts doctors' advice on how she could help others and ultimately founded her own treatment centre. \\"I started in two rooms, remortgaged my home, and it began to grow from there.\\" ==Recovery centres and activism== In 1998, she founded the Burton Addiction Centre, now the BAC O'Connor Centre, in Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, and in 2002 opened a second BAC O'Connor Centre in Clayton. She has stated that BAC has one of the highest rates of success for helping people rehabilitate from drug and alcohol addictions and integrate into society. In 2011, she told the BBC that the centre's figures show 74 percent of drug users and 83 percent of alcoholics being sober two years after completing the 18-week programme; the UK national average is 30 percent sober six years after treatment. The centre earned the highest scores in the United Kingdom from the Healthcare Commission in 2006 and has become nationally renowned, eliciting praise from Prime Minister David Cameron. The Staffordshire County Council plans to use the BAC O'Connor Centre as a template to open other similar centres across Staffordshire. Oliver established the O'Connor Gateway Trust, a charitable organisation that helps recovering drug addicts and alcoholics gain the necessary skills and qualifications for employment, and to provide a safe, social environment free from drugs or alcohol for recovering addicts. The trust also runs Recovery Is Out There (RIOT), a community group formed of recovering addicts who have been through the BAC programme. The group works to educate the community and provide support for other recovering addicts. In 2010, Burton Addiction Centre opened Langan’s Tea Rooms in Burton-on-Trent, a social enterprise that employs recovering addicts. Langan's Tea Rooms, which takes its title from her maiden name, was built in a former restaurant located in a historic building, Burton House. Burton MP Andrew Griffiths is a patron of the organisation. Oliver is a strong advocate of abstinence-based recovery. In 2010, she founded the Recovery Group UK, an alliance of academics, rehabilitation service providers and drug- and alcohol-related organisations. The Recovery Group UK is an advocacy group working toward what Oliver calls \\"a balanced, integrated, seamless treatment system focused on recovery.\\" Oliver was a speaker at the 2011 UK and European Symposium on Addictive Disorders (UKESAD) in London. She is a member of the Community, Voluntary and Local Services Honours Committee, a Cabinet Office committee that reviews nominations for national honours for merit and service. She is also a Director of The Centre for Social Justice, a leading Think Tank in the UK. ==Awards== Oliver was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire, for services to disadvantaged people in Staffordshire, as part of the 2009 New Year Honours. In 2010, she received a lifetime achievement award from the Centre for Social Justice. The recipient of the award is selected annually by the group's co- founder, MP Iain Duncan Smith. She now sits on the CSJ's board of directors as chairman of the Addictions Working Group. Prior to the 2012 Olympics in London, Oliver was invited to carry the Olympic flame during the relay in Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire. She also won the Daily Mirror People's Award for Justice in 2006. ==Personal life== She has been married to Tony Oliver, a prison officer, since 2005. She has a stepdaughter and two grandchildren. As a result of her alcoholism, she suffers from diabetes and damaged nerve endings in her legs. Through her activism she has become friends with former drug addict Russell Brand, who sought her advice about what to do with funds he had raised to help addicts. She is interviewed in his 2014 BBC Three documentary, End the Drugs War, in which Brand visits the BAC Centre and attends a graduation ceremony for a recovering addict who had just completed the programme. He also visited the Langan's Tea Rooms; he subsequently opened a similar social enterprise, the Trew Era Cafe.Russell Brand: End the Drugs War, BBC Three, 13 December 2014 She also appears in Brand: A Second Coming, a 2015 documentary about Brand's activism. ==References * BAC O'Connor Centre *Centre for Social Justice: : Lifetime Achievement Award Category:1960 births Category:Living people Category:People from Nottingham Category:Members of the Order of the British Empire Category:Drug policy reform activists ","title":"Noreen Oliver"},{"id":"46384425","text":"Oberea angolensis is a species of longhorn beetle in the tribe Saperdini in the genus Oberea, discovered by Breuning in 1950. ==References== A Category:Beetles described in 1950 ","title":"Oberea angolensis"},{"id":"46384438","text":"Hybosida lucida is a species of spiders found on Mahe Island in the Seychelles. ==References== Category:Spiders described in 1898 Category:Spiders of Africa Category:Fauna of Seychelles Category:Palpimanidae ","title":"Hybosida lucida"},{"id":"46384447","text":"Antonio Dawson, portrayed by Jon Seda, is a fictional character in the Chicago franchise and is a main character in Chicago P.D. and Chicago Justice. He was introduced as a recurring character on Chicago Fire before the spin-off Chicago P.D. was created. He was previously the second in command of the Intelligence Unit of the Chicago Police Department (CPD) and regularly appears on Chicago Fire as he is the older brother of Gabriela \\"Gabby\\" Dawson, formerly a paramedic-turned-firefighter at Firehouse 51. The character was first introduced in Chicago Fire as one of several recurring characters from the CPD who cross paths with the firefighters. In October 2016 Seda confirmed that the character would move to the third spin-off Chicago Justice, debuting in March 2017, after resigning from his position in the CPD to take up a job with the State's Attorney's Office. After Chicago Justice was cancelled, the character was written to have returned to the CPD due to his frustration with the bureaucratic red tape he often encountered. == Personal life == Dawson and his wife Laura have two children, Eva and Diego. His wife runs a restaurant which the children help in. However, subsequent events in Season 1 and Dawson's dedication to his job take a toll on their marriage, resulting in her leaving with their two children. They eventually divorce under acrimonious terms and she prevents the children from seeing their father for some time. Eva took it particularly hard and even resorted to running away to see her father. The custody issue was never fully explained on the show; the children live with their mother and Dawson keeps in touch with them by phone. Dawson was raised Catholic and once quipped to Olinsky about being \\"in a confessional every other day\\" as a boy. A boxing enthusiast (like actor Jon Seda), he had a difficult adolescence and boxing was his outlet, as shown by the fact that he runs his own gym and moonlights as a trainer when off duty. He is the older brother of Chicago Fire character Gabriela \\"Gabby\\" Dawson. The siblings come from a large extended family and share a close relationship. The character is frequently seen on Chicago Fire and was first introduced in the episode \\"Professional Courtesy\\" after Gabby and her colleagues from Firehouse 51 rescue a boy and his father in a car accident caused by a drunk Justin Voight, Hank's son. He is generally well liked by the firefighters at 51. Before transferring to Intelligence, Dawson worked on the Vice Squad. His was partnered with Detective Julie \\"Jules\\" Willhite, with whom he shared a close friendship, until she was killed by drug lord Andres \\"Pulpo\\" Diaz in \\"Stepping Stone\\". ==In Chicago Fire== Antonio is a cop who takes pride in his job. He has been involved in numerous sting and undercover operations, some of which include drug busts, high-profile arrests, and more personal cases. Dawson has a close relationship with his sister, Gabriela Dawson, a paramedic for CFD. When Antonio is shot in a drive-by shooting and severely wounded, she makes a deal with Voight, who was incarcerated at the time, for information about who shot Antonio. When Voight harasses Lieutenant Matthew Casey and his then- fiancée Dr. Hallie Thomas, Dawson sets up a sting to arrest Voight. The arrest goes successfully and Voight is incarcerated. A few months later, Internal Affairs (I.A.) has Voight released and promoted to Sergeant of Intelligence at the CPD. In season 5, Antonio begins a relationship with CFD paramedic Sylvie Brett. At the end of \\"An Agent of the Machine\\", Antonio breaks up with Sylvie after she confronted him about the confrontation between her and his former wife, Laura, when she showed up to the firehouse to pick up her son. In \\"Down is Better\\", his father was stabbed. In \\"A Man's Legacy\\", he goes to the hospital to see his father. While in the hospital, he sees Sylvie with his sister and he talks with her, indicating that they may be close to reconciling. In \\"Foul is Fair\\", it was revealed that Sylvie has broken up with Antonio but at the end of the episode \\"Hiding Not Seeking\\", after a long investigation, he and Antonio and Sylvie are seen making out in his car. == In Chicago P.D. == When Pulpo, a Colombian drug lord is arrested, Diego is kidnapped by a man named Mateo. Mateo demands that Pulpo be released or Diego will be killed. Antonio's devotion to his son is unwavering. Mateo attempts to take Diego to Indianapolis by bus, but Intelligence is able to stop him. During his rookie years, Antonio had a partner, Sean Patterson. Sean had mistakenly filed double overtime pay, a minor infraction, however, Gradishar of Internal Affairs (IA) had Sean fired and took away his pension. The shame caused him to commit suicide a year later, leaving behind a wife and kids. Antonio has never forgiven Gradishar for using Sean as her way of climbing the corporate ladder. He also worked with Trudy Platt, now the desk sergeant at the 21st District, during his patrol years and saved her life when she was shot by pulling her out of the line of fire. During the shooter's subsequent interrogation, Dawson broke his jaw. He was critically wounded when Pulpo's wife helped Pulpo escape, while three other officers were killed in the aftermath. Unlike Voight, he has limits on how far he will go to catch a criminal, as shown by the fact that he asked Jay Halstead to stop Voight from killing anyone while on the hunt for Pulpo as he did not want it on his conscience. In \\"Chicken, Dynamite, Chainsaw\\", in the locker room at the end of the shift, Sean Roman tells him about his security business. Antonio takes the job and is tempted to have an affair with the client's wife. In \\"An Honest Woman\\", he was assigned to protect Asher Roslyn. In \\"Assignment of the Year\\", he didn't know Roslyn was a felon, until Roslyn was found dead and he was heavily involved in the murder. He confronted Roman about it and it was revealed that Roman himself didn't know about Roslyn's criminal history. Since Roman was heavily involved with the unit on this case, he had to cooperate with the unit in apprehending Roslyn's killer (Roslyn's own wife, who had seduced her errand boy, Terry, into committing the murder which allowed her to escape prosecution. During the course of these episodes, it was shown that Roslyn's wife, Layla, was flirting with and trying to seduce Dawson but he turned down her advances. In \\"A Little Devil Complex\\", he shoots and kills Trenton Lamont after he traps Gabriela Dawson in an elevator with gasoline which was poured on her and holding the lighter, when she receives a false text from Sylvie Brett telling Dawson to meet her. In \\"300,000 Likes\\" Antonio is offered a job as lead investigator at the State's Attorney's Office, which he goes on to accept in the next episode, \\"A Shot Heard Around the World\\". At the end of \\"Reform\\", he gets the offer to return to Intelligence after his stint in the State's Attorney's Office. In \\"Promise\\", with Dawson back in Intelligence, he takes on a case that involves the brutal murder of a young Latina woman who is suspected to be a drug mule for a drug cartel after he and his daughter Eva came up on a crime scene and his daughter overheard an officer at the scene throw out a racist comment with regards to the victim in which he takes it personally. He was also partnered with Kim Burgess. During the investigation, the victim was ID'd as Gloria Morales. While searching the victims' apartment, Burgess and Atwater find her young son hiding in the closet. The unit soon discovered that she was an illegal immigrant working in a meat packing plant. Burgess and Dawson decide to go interview the workers in the plant. Burgess finds the victim's sister, who at first refuses to cooperate, fearing for her safety, until Antonio promises her protection. When the manager's son was arrested, Antonio goes to the plant only to find out that the manager (in order to protect his son) had placed a tip to ICE that the illegal immigrants was working there, and rounded up everyone including the victim's sister. Voight orders Antonio let the suspect go due to lack of evidence. The kid recognizes that the van was there the night his mother disappeared and the description matching another employee, Frank Lopez. But the time Antonio and Burgess go there to question him, he was gone along with the van. After his conversation with the Medical Examiner, he finds out that the victim that he found wasn't the first victim and he goes to store, only to know that the owner's niece also works at the plant and has disappeared and later found murdered. Voight tells Antonio which number in the lineup Frank will be (so that he can potentially tell Oscar). But Antonio can't bring himself to break the rules, and simply tells Oscar just to tell the truth. After the kid identifies the wrong person, the lineup was a bust. Voight angrily tells him to pick a case that he knows that there is a quick output. Antonio goes to the same store in the investigation and finds out that Voight was there. He quickly goes to Frank's house only to find him murdered. Antonio goes to Voight to confront him in his office, while he secretly wanted it to happen, Voight admits to having him killed. He goes home to his daughter. In \\"Chasing Monsters\\", he had a one-night stand with a visiting detective from El Salvador, Detective Marcella Gomez after two had mutual understanding that they separately are divorced. Kim grew suspicious of her but Antonio doesn't believe her. Antonio asks Marcella about talking to a detective in gang unit and she is honest about it. Kim, on the other hand, meets with Detective Keith O'Brien feeling she isn't getting the whole story. He tells a totally different story saying Marcella called him 2 months ago about El Lobo, not just the day before. When Antonio comes into the Squad room, Kim reveals everything they know about Marcella Gomez. Antonio is in total shock then believes her. At a house where Marcella was held up, Antonio asks Marcella to put the gun down. Antonio says it isn't worth it. Voight asks her to give him the gun but she says her life has been over since he killed her son. She shoots El Lobo in the head and raises her gun at Antonio, who takes the shot and kills her. Kim checks on Antonio at the station, he apologizes, saying he was distracted and she is a good partner who was just looking out for him. Voight says she was on a mission and there was nothing he could have said that could have stopped her. The only thing that kept her going was that hate; he reminds Antonio that he did what he had to do. Antonio looks at her picture and throws it in the garbage saying he did what she wanted him to do. In \\"Allegiance\\", he almost gets into a fight with Voight when he confronts him about why Olinsky was in prison. In \\"Homecoming\\", his loyalty came into question when he sees an inmate that was responsible of killing Olinsky, severely beaten and left bleeding on the floor. Voight initially lies but Antonio didn't buy the story. Voight told him that if he didn't approve he could get himself off the investigation. Voight orders Antonio to go a different way from him so that he can track down Carlos himself, and confronts the other man on the roof. The unarmed Carlos begs for his life, but Voight shoots him twice anyway—and says Carlos was reaching for a gun. Though Antonio does find a gun, two witnesses immediately exclaim that Voight shot the man \\"in cold blood.\\" And he was left with trying to piece the story together into what had happened on the roof. While Antonio is skeptical, Ruzek didn't care since the dead man murdered Olinsky. Just before the two can fight, Antonio is called in to testify about the shooting. He runs into Voight in the hall after but the two don't speak. In the season 6 premiere \\"New Normal\\", directly following the rattling death of Alvin Olinsky and the events after, Voight is put under investigation, leaving Antonio in charge of the unit. When Antonio answered truthfully about what he saw to the Police Board, he was unable to be of any help to Voight clearing his own name. This angered Ruzek, who defied the orders given to him by Antonio in return; it all comes to a head in the conclusion of a case, when both of them engage in a fight and have to be pried apart. Antonio was left taking the fall for the actions of Ruzek and the team, though no actual issues are mentioned; in the later episodes, which may have occurred following a time lapse, the two no longer show an ill will to one another, although Ruzek's rebellious nature is still a compromise. In \\"Bad Boys\\", during the take-down of a criminal, Antonio injures his shoulder trying to break down a door. In \\"Ride Along\\", despite Ruzek mentioning that Dawson's shoulder is looking better — followed with the claim by Dawson that he has been receiving acupuncture treatments — it is revealed that Antonio is actually taking painkiller medicine for his shoulder. Further, he was seen contacting his doctor to refill his painkillers every time he had run out which may seem that he may be addicted to them. It was confirmed in \\"Descent\\", when he ran out of a known drug house that was being raided by Intelligence, and was eventually caught by Burgess and lies about his involvement. He was caught by Voight buying pills from a drug dealer on the street. The situation became dire when his daughter was kidnapped by a drug addict, and the only way was to cut the drug dealer loose. After rescuing his daughter, Voight and Ruzek caught him. Dawson beats the kidnapper, and when he jokes about her age to aggravate him, he pushes him out the window to his death. Voight, having found out of Antonio's painkiller addiction, advises him to seek a rehab facility, while Ruzek covers for his mistake in \\"Brotherhood\\". When he came back from his rehab in \\"Trust\\", he had second thoughts about Ruzek taking the fall. The case was reopened in \\"Confession\\" at the request of Superintendent Brian Kelton. In \\"Reckoning\\", he learns from Platt that Internal Affairs had taken over the investigation, meaning they have evidence to take him down. Meeting with his old partner, he finds out the Internal Affairs' detective's daughter is working as a prostitute. Upon learning this, he decides to keep it a secret. At the end, he relapses and is seen taking pills, leaving his fate unknown. In the season 7 premiere \\"Doubt\\", he later destroys whatever is in his apartment which was discovered by Ruzek, leaving his badge before vanishing without a trace from Intelligence; when Ruzek also finds his car with prescription pill bottles laying on the passenger's seat, it was revealed that he was using again. Voight, the only person aware of Antonio's circumstances, later takes him to an off-book rehabilitation center. In \\"Familia\\", it was revealed later that Antonio resigned and moved to Puerto Rico to be near his family.

It was her fourteenth novel. The complex story is set in London and involves a large number of characters, many of whom are related to each other by family or marriage. The \\"accidental man\\" is the hapless but charming Austin Gibson Grey, whose actions drive much of the plot. His long-estranged wealthy older brother, recently retired to England after a career spent abroad, is drawn into covering up Austin's misdeeds and accidents. A second plot line involves Ludwig Leferrier, a young American academic who has resolved to stay in England in order to avoid the draft, but struggles with his decision throughout the book. The book's main moral theme is the individual's responsibility to others. Coincidence and accident play a major role in the plot, in which the efforts of supposedly well-meaning characters to help each other often fail, while others fail to act when they could be of help. An Accidental Man was generally well received by contemporary reviewers, who viewed it as mainly a comic novel. ==Plot== The novel is set in London. The plot involves a large number of characters who are related to each other by family or acquaintance. The \\"accidental man\\" of the title is Austin Gibson Grey, a middle-aged man who has lost his job and is living apart from his mentally fragile second wife Dorina. Austin's older brother, Sir Matthew Gibson Grey, has returned to London after a successful diplomatic career. The two brothers have been estranged for many years. Austin blames his brother for having injured him when they were children, leaving him with a deformed right hand, and for having had an affair with his first wife, both of which accusations Matthew denies. Matthew tries to reconcile with his brother, whose actions and accidents drive much of the plot. The novel begins with the engagement of Ludwig Leferrier, a young American historian, to Gracie, the daughter of George and Clara Tisbourne. Ludwig has decided to remain in England after a scholarship year in Oxford, rather than return to the United States. He is opposed to the Vietnam War and expects to be arrested for having avoided the draft if he goes home. Ludwig gets a job teaching at an Oxford college. Gracie's wealthy grandmother dies and leaves all her property to Gracie, despite the fact that her daughter Charlotte, Clara's sister, had lived with her and looked after her during her illness. During the course of the novel Ludwig begins to question his relationship with Gracie, who does not share his intellectual and moral seriousness, and who discourages him from trying to help Dorina and Charlotte. He also doubts his own motivation for staying in England. Other important characters include Austin's son Garth, who had been Ludwig's friend as a student at Harvard, and who also returns to London at the outset of the novel; Dorina's sister (and Matthew's lover) Mavis, a social worker who has lost her religious faith; and Mitzi Ricardo, a former star athlete whose career was ended by a freak accident and who works as a typist. Austin, with whom she is unrequitedly in love, rents a room in Mitzi's house. Austin, driving Matthew's car while drunk, hits and kills a child. With Matthew's help, Austin manages to escape police suspicion, but the child's father starts blackmailing him. In an altercation in Austin's room Austin hits him on the head, apparently killing him, and calls on Matthew, who helps him to make the death look like an accident before calling the police. In fact, the man is not dead, but suffers brain damage and memory loss, so the crime is undetected. Both Mitzi and Charlotte attempt suicide by taking overdoses of sleeping pills, but both are rescued in time and are taken to recover in the same hospital ward. They end up living together in a cottage in the country. Austin's wife Dorina, having left Mavis's house where she had been staying, goes into hiding in a hotel, where she dies accidentally when an electric heater falls into her bathtub. Shortly before her death she and Ludwig had seen each other in the street, but ignored each other. Ludwig is remorseful about his failure to approach her and feels that his reticence may have contributed to her death. Ludwig decides to break off his engagement with Gracie and return home, where he may be drafted or arrested. At the end of the novel he is on his way to the United States, accompanied by Matthew, who had helped him make the decision to go back. Garth, who has become a successful novelist, marries Gracie, while Austin starts a new relationship with his brother's abandoned lover Mavis. ==Narrative structure== The novel, with its complicated plot and large number of characters, is divided into 74 relatively short sections rather than named or numbered chapters, and is \\"openly, often almost ramblingly narrated\\". The action is punctuated by several collections of letters in which the correspondents sometimes comment on the plot, and sometimes relate their own actions outside the scope of the novel. Some of the letter writers, including Gracie's brother Patrick and Ludwig's colleague Andrew, do not appear in the main narrative but are present at one or more of three large parties which bring together most of the main characters. The party scenes are not narrated but consist of unattributed snatches of conversation. The letter sections and party scenes constitute a mostly comic \\"shadow novel\\". ==Major themes== Accident is a major theme of the novel, which contains many coincidences and accidental occurrences, including several deaths. Austin calls himself an \\"accidental man\\" and sees himself always as a victim of other people and of his own bad luck. Late in the novel Matthew reflects on Austin's \\"contamination\\" of Mavis, and concedes that \\"Austin had not really done this \\"on purpose\\"\\", but that it was \\" like so many other things in the story, an accident.\\" Accident, in the form of the many coincidences in the plot, is also the source of much of novel's humour. The central moral theme of the novel is the individual's responsibility to others, as exemplified by the parable of the Good Samaritan. Before the action of the novel, two of the characters happened to witness events that evoke the parable. Garth saw a man being knifed on a New York City street and did not act, even though the man saw him and appealed for help. Matthew, observing a street protest in Moscow, saw another passerby joining the protesters in solidarity shortly before the police came and arrested them all. These events, to which their thoughts often turn, have had a profound effect on their views of themselves as moral agents. Ludwig is tormented throughout the novel by his decision to marry Gracie and stay in England, while his parents plead with him to return to the United States. The accidental death of Dorina just after he has passed her in the street without acknowledgement awakens him to his complicity with Gracie's uncharitable attitudes and leads to the discussions with Matthew which result in Ludwig's going home. However, Austin's chronic bad luck, which appears to be \\"an infectious moral flaw\\", calls into question the universality of the Good Samaritan's message of helping the unlucky. ==Literary significance and reception== An Accidental Man, Iris Murdoch's fourteenth novel, was widely reviewed in Great Britain and elsewhere. It was generally viewed as primarily a comic novel. The Times called it \\"one of her good books and certainly one of her funniest\\". In The New York Times Anatole Broyard wrote that with An Accidental Man Iris Murdoch had \\"become, at last, a complete novelist\\", in that she had succeeded in making her characters believable. This is contrasted with earlier, more tightly plotted novels, in which her characters sometimes seemed to be unconvincing \\"puppets in a metaphysical Punch and Judy show\\". The Toronto Globe and Mail reviewer also noted Murdoch's ability to create characters who believably engage in moral and philosophical thinking, singling out Ludwig's moral struggle as particularly well done. Nora Sayre, in The New York Times Book Review, remarked on the individuality of the characters and their inability to \\"help or simply influence one another\\", noting the absence of \\"all-powerful sorcerers\\". This is a reference to the charismatic manipulator type who appears in some of Murdoch's earlier books. She judged the novel \\"fairly difficult\\" but \\"better written than many of its predecessors\\". Joyce Carol Oates, on the other hand, found the length and complexity of the novel excessive, and the relationships among the characters \\"relentlessly obscure\\". Literary scholars have also viewed An Accidental Man as a comic novel, and in various ways as a departure from Murdoch's earlier work. In his study of Iris Murdoch's fiction, Peter J. Conradi calls An Accidental Man \\"marvellous\\" for its combination of \\"moral passion and idealism\\" with \\"absence of illusion and moral skepticism\\", which results in an dryly ironic tone reminiscent of Henry James's The Awkward Age. Angela Hague describes the novel as a \\"brittle comedy of manners\\" and says that Murdoch's purpose was to create a \\"Dickensian sweep of characters\\". Frank Baldanza compares An Accidental Man with Murdoch's previous novel A Fairly Honourable Defeat. Both display \\"trenchant irony\\" about the ineffectuality of conventionally good and well-meaning characters. In the earlier novel they were frustrated by the schemes of a demonic individual, while An Accidental Man impersonal chance takes on this role. In her study of Murdoch's fiction Hilda Spear includes it in a group of novels that are \\"deeply concerned with the problems of Good and Evil\\". She sees the structure of the novel, with its loose narration interspersed with letter sections, as both a major departure for Murdoch and evidence of her \\"genuine narrative skills\\". ==References== Category:1971 British novels Category:Novels by Iris Murdoch Category:Chatto & Windus books ","title":"An Accidental Man"},{"id":"46384463","text":"Herman L.

The Piston suite was recorded on April 13–15, 2013, \\"A Jazz Symphony\\" was recorded on April 20–22, 2013, and Copland's symphony was recorded on January 5, 2014. The album was the third recording by the orchestra during Carlos Kalmar's tenure, following the highly successful Music for a Time of War (2011) and This England (2012). Like these albums, Spirit of the American Range was recorded in hybrid multichannel (surround sound) Super Audio CD format by Soundmirror recording engineers John Newton and Blanton Alspaugh. Mark Donahue served as the mixing and mastering engineer. The album's liner notes are credited to Elizabeth Schwartz with German translations by Franz Steiger; its cover photography was taken by Martha Warrington, and it features designs by freshu. Angelina Jambrekovic served as product manager. Job Maarse, artistic director of Pentatone, said of the album's origins: > From day one the co-operation between Pentatone and the Oregon Symphony and > its Music Director Carlos Kalmar has been something magical. The quality of > the orchestra and the program ideas of Carlos Kalmar attracted the attention > of a large group of music lovers in and outside the U.S. During a pleasant > meeting at the Chicago airport almost two years ago the idea for this new > album was discussed. I believe all at the table liked it and now everybody > can hear how these three pieces, although by composers with different > styles, fit perfectly in one program. And of course the Copland symphony is > one of the best pieces ever written by an American composer. Kalmar said of the recording, \\"It is a great pleasure to share these important American works for which I have the greatest fondness and appreciation. They aren't widely performed and certainly deserve to be enjoyed by a wider public.\\" Spirit of the American Range was funded in part by the James DePreist Fund for Broadcast and Recording. Works The recording features composer Aaron Copland's Symphony No. 3. The Incredible Flutist (1938), Piston's only composition for the stage, received its premiere at Symphony Hall on May 30, 1938 by the Boston Pops under Arthur Fiedler. The performance featured work by dancer-choreographer Hans Wiener and his ballet company. The ballet is about residents of a small village becoming enchanted by a flutist affiliated with a traveling circus. Antheil's \\"A Jazz Symphony\\" was composed in 1925 and premiered at Carnegie Hall on April 10, 1927. It is written for two oboes, two clarinets, one soprano saxophone, one alto saxophone, one tenor saxophone, three trumpets, three trombones, tuba, percussion, drum set, two pianos, two banjos (one doubling guitar), strings, and solo piano. According to Antheil, the work is: \\"one of the very first symphonic expressions which attempted to synthesize American jazz as a legitimate symphonic expression\\". Copland's third symphony was composed between 1944 and September 1946, and was premiered by Serge Koussevitzky conducting the Boston Symphony Orchestra on October 18, 1946. It is written for three flutes, two piccolos, three oboes and English horn, two clarinets, E-flat clarinet, bass clarinet, two bassoons and contrabassoon, four horns, four trumpets, three trombones and tuba, timpani, two harps, celesta, piano, strings, and a variety of percussion instruments, including bass drum, tam-tam, cymbals, xylophone, glockenspiel, tenor drum, wood block, snare drum, triangle, slapstick, ratchet, anvil, claves, and tubular bells. Copland said the work would \\"reflect the euphoric spirit of the country at the time\\". ==Broadcasts and reception== KQAC (89.9 FM, \\"All Classical Portland\\") broadcast the album on January 8, 2015 and made it available to stream on its website. The station offered the album as a thank you gift to donors during a fundraising campaign. Classical Voice North America Paul E. Robinson said the album's contents were unrelated to its title, and had \\"nothing whatever to do with the early days of the American West\\", but complimented the orchestra's performances. He praised the \\"excellent\\" flute soloist in The Incredible Flutist, called the performance of Copland's symphony \\"more careful than inspired\\", and noted the \\"vast dynamic range\\" created by the label's sound technology. Peter Dickinson of Gramophone compared Kalmar's interpretation of Symphony No. 3 to other available recordings: \\"Kalmar and the Oregon Symphony are impressive and create a challenge to the established choices. Kalmar is a minute shorter than Bernstein in both the opening movement and fanfare finale. Overall his interpretation is similar to Bernstein's, and the orchestra's expert handling of the work suggests that they should record more.\\" Furthermore, he wrote, \\"Engineering is excellent but individual tracks for the Piston would have been a help.\\" Anthony Tommasini, music critic for The New York Times, called the recording \\"exciting\\" and said the Piston piece received a \\"supple, colorful performance\\". He complimented \\"A Jazz Symphony\\", which he said \\"emerges here as a savvy, audacious score\\", and ended his review with: \\"Best of all is an urgent, superbly played account of Copland's Third Symphony.\\" The Oregonian David Stabler praised the Oregon Symphony for recording the lesser-known works by Piston and Antheil. The album received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Orchestral Performance at the 58th Annual Grammy Awards, marking the third for Kalmar and the orchestra. In addition, Alspaugh was nominated for Producer of the Year, Classical. Kalmer said of the recognition, \\"I think this is a confirmation of the excellent quality that the orchestra is offering. In my mind, it's very important that we get nominated. Whether we get the Grammy or not has so many other components.\\" Christine Whiteside, executive director of the Oregon Symphony Association in Salem, said, \\"It validates the quality of the Oregon Symphony, and what a great honor it is to have a Grammy-nominated orchestra play in Salem.\\" ==Track listing== # \\"Suite from The Incredible Flutist\\" (Walter Piston) – 17:12 # \\"A Jazz Symphony\\" (George Antheil) – 7:07 ; Symphony No. 3 (Aaron Copland) # * \\"Molto Moderato, with simple expression'\\" – 9:55 # \\"Allegro molto\\" – 7:55 # \\"Andantino quasi allegretto\\" – 10:13 # \\"Motto deliberato (Fanfare) – Allegro risoluto\\" – 12:55 Track listing adapted from the album's liner notes.

At Berea Community High School, Todd starred on the basketball court where he set still-standing school records for scoring (1,683) and rebounding (966). Following high school, Todd attended Eastern Kentucky University where he graduated in 1984. He and his wife, Renee, have three children, Brooke, Katie, and Robert (Robby). Brooke is a 2018 graduate of Morehead State University where she played four seasons for her father and finished her career ranked second in blocked shots. Katie currently attends Morehead State and is an active member of multiple student organizations on campus. ==Coaching career== Todd began his head coaching career at his alma mater, Berea Community High. From 1992-99, Todd led the Lady Pirates to a record of 166–54 and seven 20-win seasons. Todd's 1998 BCHS team achieved the best finish in school history during the 1997-98 campaign as it advanced to the semi-final round of the 1998 KHSAA Kentucky Sweet Sixteen Tournament where it fell to eventual champion, Elizabethtown. In 1999, Todd took over the women's basketball program at Lexington Catholic High. From 1999-06, the coach compiled a stellar 225–26 record which included three KHSAA Kentucky State Championships (2001,05,06) and two runner-up finishes. Todd's 2005-06 team would earn the coach national recognition as the EA Sports National Coach of the Year award as it finished 35-1 on its way to a championship and a KHSAA record #3 ranking in the final USA Today national girl's basketball poll. The team featured five All-State players and seven players that signed scholarships to play in Division I.. Todd finished his 14 seasons coaching in the high school ranks with a combined record of 391-80 (.830) and is the only coach in KHSAA girl's basketball history to win over 375 games and have less than 100 losses. In July 2017, Todd's achievements coaching high school basketball were recognized as he was inducted into the Kentucky High School Basketball Hall of Fame in Owensboro, Kentucky. In 2019, Todd was inducted into the Berea Community School Athletics Hall of Fame as well as the Lexington Catholic High School Hall of Fame. Following his run at Lexington Catholic, Todd moved into the collegiate coaching ranks at Division III Transylvania University beginning in 2006-07 season. Todd took over a team that had a losing record the previous season and immediately improved them to a 19–9 record and a third-place finish in the Heartland Collegiate Athletic Conference. After nearly upsetting conference champion Manchester in the conference tournament final, Transylvania received the first of the three invitations to the NCAA Women's Division III Basketball Championship it would get during Todd's tenure. In his eight seasons at Transylvania, his teams won three conferences regular season and two tournament championships, accumulating a record of 157–64. In Todd's first season leading the Morehead State Eagles, his team was picked to finish last in the twelve-team race, but finished 8–8 and in sixth place after fading from an early third place. In 2018–2019 Todd had arguably his best season as a coach as he led the Eagles to a 24-11 year capped off by a WNIT bid, only the second ever in program history. In the opening round, the Eagles traveled to Columbus, OH, to play the Big Ten's Ohio State Buckeyes. After trailing most of the first half, Todd's team fought back to score an upset win over the Buckeyes 71-61, which many would consider being the program's biggest victory in the modern era. Todd's Eagles then traveled to Bowling Green KY. to face Western Kentucky and eventually lost in heartbreaking fashion against the Hilltoppers in the round of 32 by a score of 68-65. While at Morehead State, Todd has coached five players to First-Team All-OVC honors, two players to Second-Team All-OVC honors, two All-OVC Newcomer Team members, and one All-OVC Tournament Team member. Todd has also helped the program achieve unparalleled recruiting victories as it has signed four previous ESPN Top 100 players. ==Head coaching record== Source: * OVC 2017-18 Women's Basketball Standings ==References * Eagles women's basketball webpage Category:Living people Category:American women's basketball coaches Category:Basketball coaches from Kentucky Category:High school basketball coaches in the United States Category:Morehead State Eagles women's basketball coaches Category:People from Berea, Kentucky Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Greg Todd (basketball)"},{"id":"46384565","text":"United Pictures Corporation was an American film production company in the mid 1960s who specialized in the production of nine action and science fiction films shot economically with an eye for their product to be viewed in both theatrical release and purchased for television showing. The organization became part of Commonwealth United Entertainment who released their films theatrically. ==History== In 1966 United Pictures Corporation (UPC) was created to produce color feature films aimed principally for the growing broadcast syndication and network television markets with the company originally funded by Canadian oil interests. The company believed that a well- mounted product with recognizable names in the cast, made at a modest price, would return a reasonable profit to the production company from the television markets alone. At that time feature films shot in colour were eagerly sought to be shown on television as opposed to the large backlog of black and white feature films. The majority of subject matter mostly comprised the then popular themes of science fiction and spy films and featured casts of recognizable and experienced actors whose names still held drawing power for both audience enjoyment and film funding. The board of UPC comprised four people. Director Francis D. Lyon was in charge of production and directed five of their nine films. Earle Lyon, who was no relation to Francis, acted as executive producer. Both the Lyons met during the production of the Tales of Wells Fargo television series. Fred Jordan acted as another executive producer whilst Edmund Baumgarten, a former Bank of America motion picture loan officer and former president of Regal Pictures headed the company's business affairs. For screenwriters, UPC acquired Charles A. Wallace, who wrote four of UPC's films and science fiction writer Arthur C. Pierce who wrote four other UPC films. Paul Dunlap composed scores for seven of the films. Cinematographer Alan Stensvold photographed six of their films. Paul Sylos was art director for six of their films, Roger George provided special effects for five films, Robert S. Eisen edited five. UPC used several people who had worked for Republic Pictures; Franklin Adreon who directed two UPC films, R.G. Springsteen who directed one and stuntman Dale Van Sickel. Originally UPC planned to do their own film distribution but financial backers of UPC saw the opportunity to reduce and redistribute costs by accepting a distribution deal and some financing from Harold Goldman Associates in exchange for a percentage of profits to go to Goldman's organisation. Goldman had created National Telefilm Associates in the mid 1950s. Besides being provided as second features to American cinemas, UPC provided their films to US military film exchanges and for overseas theatrical release. All but the first film UPC produced, Castle of Evil were sold to the CBS American television network. UPC's first films Castle of Evil and Destination Inner Space were shot back to back in fourteen days in 1966 with Lyon stating \\"I don't recommend this hurried approach as a practice, because quality has to suffer.\\"P 38 Lyon, Francis D.

There are also Lodges operating under the Scottish Masonic Constitution in countries outside of Scotland. Many of these are countries linked to Scotland and the United Kingdom through the Commonwealth of Nations and prior colonies and other settlements of the British Empire although there are several lodges in countries such as Lebanon, Belgium, Chile and Peru, which do not have such connections. The Grand Lodge of Scotland is independent of, though in amity with, both of the other Grand Lodges established in the UK and Ireland, the United Grand Lodge of England and the Grand Lodge of Ireland. As of 2018, it consists of 32 Provincial Grand Lodges in Scotland and 26 District Grand Lodges beyond the boundary of Scotland. ==History== John Murray, 4th Duke of Atholl, the Scottish peer and Grand Master of the \\"Antients\\" King George VI, former Grand Master Mason of the Grand Lodge of Scotland, with Scottish Freemasons Robert Burns, member of several Scottish lodges (portraint by Alexander Nasmyth, 1787, detail) It has been argued that regulated Freemasonry in Scotland is older than in any other part of the British Isles. The connection between the craft of stonemasonry and modern Freemasonry can be readily established in Scotland.Dr David Stevenson, Review of The Origins of Freemasonry Facts and Fictions, (review no. 517) accessed 6 December 2013 This direct connection can be traced from the oldest Masonic written records in the world, which are the property of the Grand Lodge of Scotland in Edinburgh. The oldest records held by the Grand Lodge of Scotland are minutes of Lodge Aitcheson's Haven which commence on 9 January 1599. The meeting minutes of the Lodge of Edinburgh (Mary's Chapel) No.1 also date from 1599. Lodge Mother Kilwinning is number 0 on the Roll of the Grand Lodge of Scotland, and is reputed to be the oldest Lodge not only in Scotland, but the world. It is styled Mother Lodge of Scotland, attributing its origins to the 12th century, and is often called Mother Kilwinning. The Lodge of Dunfermline, no. 26 on the Roll of the Grand Lodge of Scotland, and formally Lodge St John claims that it is one of the most ancient masonic lodges in Scotland. It connects directly with \\"the Ludge of Masons of Dunfermling\\" which held St. Clair Charters in 1598 and 1628. It doubtless existed prior to these dates, which gives a fair assumption that it played a part in the addition to, Dunfermline Palace (1540). The earliest record in possession of the Lodge is dated 1698. At the meeting in Edinburgh on 30 November l736, when Grand Lodge was formed, the Lodge had three representatives, Captain Arthur Forbes of Pittencrieff (Master), Bailie Charles Chalmers, and Henry Finlay (Wardens), and was of course, in the original province of Fife, when formed in 1745. Interesting notes bearing on its antiquity are contained in a booklet issued in connection with the opening, of their new hall in Priory Lane (a Lodgeroom in excellent taste) which was consecrated by the P.G.M., the Earl of Elgin and Kincardine, on 17 December 1920, The hall is at present in use for national purposes making it difficult to gain access to old records. From the information available, the Secretary informs us that the date of the present Charter is 1766; that an early meeting place was the Spire Tavern c. 1814, and that the first R.W.M. was Lieut. Charles Durie. In 1717, four Lodges in London agreed to form the Grand Lodge of England, which many Scots joined; the Earl of Crawford was Grandmaster in 1734. Its Scottish counterpart was established in 1736, in a conscious effort to match the status of the English rite. When in the second quarter of the 18th century the Grand Lodge of England made changes to their ritual, this not only caused frictions between Grand Lodge and many unaffiliated lodges in England, but also took Freemasonry as practised in England and Wales out of step with the new Grand Lodges in Scotland and Ireland.Grand Lodge of British Columbia and Yukon The Formation of the Grand Lodge of the Antients, I. R. Clarke, Ars Quatuor Coronatorum, vol. 79 (1966), pp. 270-73, retrieved 28 June 2012 In 1751, a group of unaffiliated lodges of mainly Irish membership formed the Antient Grand Lodge of England, which grew in number of lodges and individual membership rapidly and also benefited from early recognition by the Grand Lodges of Scotland and Ireland.Douglas Knoop, The Genesis of Freemasonry, Manchester University Press, 1947 In the ensuing competition for authenticity and historical accuracy of ritual, the newer English grand lodge became known for short as the \\"Antients\\", while the older English grand lodge was referred to as the \\"Moderns\\". In 1799, the Grand Lodge of Scotland supported the Duke of Atholl (Grand Master of the \\"Antients\\") and the Earl of Moira (Acting Grand Master of the \\"Moderns\\") to keep Freemasonry in the British Isles from being outlawed by British government legislation against secret societies. In 1809 the \\"Moderns\\" started revising their ritual to a point where it was in step with the Antients, the Scots and the Irish.Pietre-Stones Lodges of Instruction, Yasha Beresiner, retrieved 17 July 2012 It was not until 1813 that the \\"Antients\\" and \\"Moderns\\" agreed on an Act of Union and formed the United Grand Lodge of England. While the conflict between the \\"Antients\\" and \\"Moderns\\" was to have a profound impact on Freemasonry as practised in England and Wales, it had comparatively little influence on Freemasonry in Ireland and Scotland. At the same time, Freemasonry in Scotland was able to maintain its distinct and unique character. ==Character== Freemasonry in Scotland has a character distinct from that practised in other parts of the British Isles. When the Grand Lodge of Scotland was founded in 1736, the majority of Masonic Lodges then in existence in Scotland did not engage with the new body. By their absence from the initial discussions to which these lodges had been invited, 79% did not support the creation of a new, centralised Masonic system as already existed in England and Wales and in Ireland.Robert L. Cooper, 'Foreword', in: William R. Harvey, The Emblems of Freemasonry, Glasgow 2010, p. v-vi. In addition, because all of the Lodges in Scotland pre-existed the new Grand Lodge at the time of its proposed formation, these had developed traditions and practices that they were reluctant to give up. As a result, the new Grand Lodge of Scotland had to trade off any attempt at standardisation of ritual for the prospect of attracting the independent lodges to join the centralised system. In essence, Grand Lodge agreed not to interfere with local custom and practice as long as the lodges were willing to join the new Scottish Masonic Constitution. Having guaranteed the principle of independence to those Lodges founded before 1736, it was considered impossible to deny Lodges founded after 1736 the same privilege. These were permitted to devise their own procedures, regalia, and distinctive rituals. This and subsequent developments ensured that Freemasonry in Scotland is far less standardised than in any other masonic jurisdiction. ==Organisation== Lodges under the Scottish Masonic Constitution are sovereign bodies in their own right, with a considerable degree of control of their own affairs. There is no single, standard Scottish ritual, and every Lodge under the Scottish Masonic Constitution has the right to devise its own ritual should it so wish. The operating principle is that a lodge ritual must contain the principal points of each Masonic degree and be subject to scrutiny by Grand Lodge. The various rituals in current use adhere to this principle, but the scope for variation and elaboration is considerable, with numerous interesting additions. Lodges under the Scottish Masonic Constitution also have the right to choose the colours of the Lodge regalia, which may include one or more colours or incorporate traditional tartan patterns. The colours reserved for Provincial Grand Lodges and Grand Lodge itself are green and gold, although some older lodges also have these colours. Craft Lodges under the Scottish Masonic Constitution offer the three traditional Masonic degrees as well as the rank of Past (or Installed) Master. As in many other Masonic Constitutions, brethren in Scotland who have attained the degree of a Master Mason can choose to, or be invited to, extend their Masonic experience by taking further degrees in approved appendant bodies.Robert L.D. Cooper, Cracking the Freemason's Code, Rider 2006, p229 ==Appendant bodies== Most Freemasons in Scotland choose to be advanced as Mark Master Masons after completing the three degrees of Craft Freemasonry, and the Mark degree is considered to be a part of the second of these degrees. However, a smaller number of Freemasons in Scotland subsequently apply to join the Holy Royal Arch and take their Mark degree in that body. Under the Scottish Masonic Constitution, the Mark master's degree can be taken either within a Craft Lodge after having attained the degree of Master Mason, or within a Royal Arch Chapter, before taking the degree of Excellent Master. No one under the Scottish Masonic Constitution can be exalted as a Royal Arch Mason without previously having been advanced as a Mark Master Mason. Under the terms of etiquette about inter-visitation between masonic Constitutions, English Royal Arch Masons are unable to attend a Royal Arch Chapter in Scotland during a Mark working unless they also hold that degree. In the English Masonic Constitution, the Mark degree which is administered by a separate \\"Grand Lodge of Mark Master Masons\\" and it is not necessary for this degree to be held before joining the Royal Arch. The Excellent Master degree does not exist in England, and English Royal Arch Masons are not permitted to attend these workings in Scotland. They may also be unable to be present at a part of the Royal Arch working in Scotland which is no longer part of English Royal Arch ritual, although this is at the discretion of individual Chapters. These restrictions do not apply to members of Royal Arch chapters in Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, and North America, as the Royal Arch as practised in these Constitutions is more fully compatible with Scottish practice. There are several other masonic orders, including; * The Knights Templar * The Red Cross of Constantine * The Royal Order of Scotland * The Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite * The Masonic Knights Templar * The Red Cross of Constantine Bodies of the Order of Knight Masons, the Allied Masonic Degrees and the Order of the Secret Monitor also exist in Scotland. The Order of the Eastern Star, is a fraternal organisation for women who are related to a Freemason which also requires Masonic office bearers. It has declined in both Chapters and overall membership from its peak, but is still present in several areas of Scotland. == Current Grand Office Bearers == The current Grand Master Mason is Brother William Ramsay McGhee, a former Police Chief Superintendent, who was first installed in November 2018.https://www.grandlodgescotland.com/structure/grand-office- bearers/https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/news/black-isle-former-police- officer-is-new-top-mason-175564/ The Grand Secretary is Brother J.

The proposal has been debated in a number of countries in recent years, including Japan. (See the Wikipedia article universal basic income around the world for comparative discussion). According to Hirano Hiroya of Mejiro University, the growing debate is understandable, as social exclusion, precarity in the labor market and poverty have increased in recent decades.Hiroya, Hirano The Potential of introducing Basic Income for the“New Public Commons” in Japan: A Road to Associational Welfare State? (read February 5, 2013) Indeed, the state welfare system in Japan developed quite late and is still considerably less generous than in Europe, with the state playing a much smaller role in welfare provision and families, local communities and corporations play a larger role. In response to the combined effects of automation and job uncertainty, two political parties support universal basic income: Reiwa Shinsengumi and Greens Japan. Japanese academics arguing for basic income include Toru Yamamori of Doshisha University and Hiroya Hirano of Nihon Fukushi University. Ronald Dore, a British sociologist specializing in the Japanese welfare state, has also been engaged in the basic income debate for many years, arguing for its implementation.

William Orton was born in Cuba, New York on June 14, 1826. He was trained as a printer and worked on a newspaper in the village of Cuba. He graduated from the State Normal School (now the State University of New York at Albany) in 1847, and received his certification as a teacher. He taught at a school in Cuba, and then moved to Geneva to become a clerk in a bookstore. In 1852 Orton moved to Buffalo, where he became a partner in a publishing company called Derby, Orton & Co. In 1858 Orton moved to New York City to become a partner in another publishing company, Miller & Orton. This firm went out of business two years later, with Orton moving to the bookselling and publishing firm of J. G. Gregory & Co. as managing clerk. A Republican and supporter of the Union during the American Civil War, Orton was elected to New York City's Common Council in 1860, and served one term. From 1862 to 1865 he was federal Collector of Revenue for the 6th district of New York. In 1865 Orton was appointed Commissioner of Internal Revenue, but he served at this post in Washington, D.C. for only four months before resigning to resume his business career. Orton was appointed president of the United States Telegraph Company in the fall of 1865. When this company merged with Western Union in 1866 Orton was appointed Western Union's vice president. He also studied law, and attained admission to the bar in 1867. In 1867 Jeptha Wade resigned as president of Western Union, and Orton succeeded him. In addition to his position at Western Union, Orton was president of the Gold and Stock Telegraph Company, International Ocean Telegraph Company, and Atlantic and Southern Telegraph Company. In 1871 President Ulysses S. Grant offered the position of Collector of the Port of New York to John Augustus Griswold, who declined. Grant then offered to nominate Orton, who also declined. Griswold and Orton both recommended Chester A. Arthur, who received the appointment. Orton was a delegate to the 1872 and 1876 Republican National Conventions. He was active in the Episcopal Church, and served as a vestryman at New York City's Church of the Holy Apostles. ==Death and burial== Orton died at his home in New York City on April 22, 1878. He was buried at Sleepy Hollow Cemetery in Sleepy Hollow, New York. He was succeeded by Norvin Green as the head of Western Union. ==Family== In 1852 Orton married Agnes J. Gillespie of Buffalo.

Zabelka was a Catholic wartime chaplain of the U.S. Army Air Force. He was assigned to the 509th Composite Group, the unit which was responsible for dropping the atomic bombs (”Little Boy” and “Fat Man”) on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Stationed on Tinian Island, his duties included saying Mass on Sunday and during the week, hearing confessions, talking with the soldiers, and other typical duties of a wartime chaplain. Zabelka was also very much a soldier and once received a military reprimand for “excessive zeal.” He left the military with the rank of lieutenant colonel. Then in 1973 he went on a retreat with other priests of his diocese that focused on the issue and the implications of Gospel nonviolence. About December 1975, he did what he called “an about face” (using a military term that means turn completely around). But his conversion may have started just months after the dropping of the atomic bombs as he says: \\"Three of us chaplains took a trip to Nagasaki to see [the results of] the bombing. There were no restrictions of any kind. So we went to the nearest place where there were still the survivors. And this I think is what really got me started on even a beginning of a new way of thinking on this. Because, here were little children that were horribly burned and suffering and dying. By that time there were nurses and doctors taking care of them, because this was two or three months afterwards. But this was the beginning of a whole new kind of worm squirming in my stomach that something was wrong. These little children had nothing to do with the war. Why were they suffering?\\" This quote can be found between 25:40 and 26:17 of The Reluctant Prophet DVD. ==Early life== George Benedict Zabelka (1915-1992), the Catholic Chaplain for the 509th Composite Group, the Atomic Bomb crews on Tinian Island in 1945, was born in St. John’s, Michigan on May 8, 1915. His parents, John J. (1883-1957) and Katarina (Zolek, 1874-1940) Zabelka, were Moravian Catholics who immigrated to the United States before the First World War, from Austria- Hungary where his father served in the army. George Zabelka was raised on a sixty-acre farm and attended elementary school in a one-room schoolhouse in St. John’s, Michigan. Upon graduation from grammar school, he entered the Sacred Heart Minor Seminary of the Catholic Archdiocese of Detroit. He completed his high school education there, and matriculated to Mount St. Mary’s Catholic Seminary in Cincinnati, Ohio, where he completed his college degree and theological education. He was ordained a Roman Catholic priest on June 7, 1941 by the Catholic Bishop of the Diocese of Lansing, Michigan, Joseph H. Albers. He celebrated his first Mass at St. Joseph’s Church in St. John’s Michigan. His first pastoral assignment was as assistant pastor to Rev. John Blasko at Sacred Heart Parish in Flint, Michigan. He remained in that position until December 1943. ==Military career== In December 1943, Rev. Zabelka joined the United States Army Air Corps Chaplaincy, attending Chaplaincy School at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He served first as a chaplain at Wright Field, a United States Army Air Corps airfield in Riverside, Ohio. His persistent request for combat chaplaincy service eventually resulted in his being assigned to the 309th General Hospital Unit on Tinian Island in the Marianas in 1945. The 509th Composite Group, which included the atomic bomb crews, also arrived in 1945 on Tinian Island in preparation for the bombing of Japan. The 509th had a Protestant chaplain but no Catholic chaplain. For security reasons, the 509th Group was sealed off from all other military personnel and operations on the island. Rev. George Zabelka was formally assigned by his military superiors to serve as its Catholic chaplain through August 1945. In September 1945 he was transferred to mainland Japan. He served in the Occupation Forces in Japan from September 1945 to November 1946. He was first stationed on the southern island of Honshu, then in Tokyo and finally at Yamagata. During this time he earned his paratrooper’s wings. Zabelka was not only a Catholic military chaplain, but was known to be “all soldier.” He once received a military reprimand for “excessive zeal.” George Zabelka was discharged from the military at Fort Lewis, Washington, in December 1946 with the rank of major. He returned to the Diocese of Lansing and was assigned as a parish priest to St. Thomas Aquinas Parish in East Lansing, where he was the moderator of the Newman Center at Michigan State University and was the Catholic chaplain for the Boys Vocational School in Lansing. He joined the Michigan National Guard and was assigned as Catholic Chaplain to the 125th Infantry Regiment. He stayed in the National Guard for twenty years, retiring as a lieutenant colonel. ==Return to parish life== In 1955 Fr. Zabelka was transferred to Sacred Heart Parish in Flint, Michigan, with notification from the Bishop that the parish would soon close. He fought successfully to keep the church and parochial school open for black children, despite major objections from a variety of sources and an ongoing struggle over finances. He and his parishioners started “Heart of the City” in Flint. This was a project whose goal was to train young black people for employment and to offer them counseling and other social services, including sometimes food, if there was a need. He preached against racism, vigorously and often during a time when racial antagonism and enmity often erupted into violence. He participated in the Poor Peoples’ March on Washington and stayed in Resurrection City. In 1968, with riots erupting all over the U.S., including in Detroit, in response to the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., George Zabelka was the only white person able to walk the streets of Flint, in the company of young black men and women who were trying to prevent Flint from turning into Detroit. During these years, Zabelka also founded “Focus on Progress, a program to help students having academic difficulty in school upgrade their learning skills in those areas in which they were deficient. In the African-American community of Flint it was universally said, “Fr. George is a real civil rights man.” In 1969, he suffered a heart attack. In 1971, following his recovery, he was transferred to a smaller parish, St. James, in Mason, Michigan. During this decade, motivated by his lifelong devotion to the Blessed Mother and the Rosary, he became a Tertiary Dominican, an order uniquely related to the Rosary and its history. He took the name Brother Thomas. ==Conversion to Gospel Nonviolence== In 1973, Rev. Zabelka attended a three-day workshop given by his Diocese for the priests of his Diocese on Gospel Nonviolence directed by a layman, Emmanuel Charles McCarthy. In the following two years, he attended the same workshop on two other occasions in different locations. Then, in his 1975 Christmas letter to his friends, he wrote this: ”“I do not want to lose any of you as my friends and I certainly do not want to offend any of you, but I must do an about face. I have attended this workshop on Christian Nonviolence several times and have read the books that were recommended at it. I have come to the conclusion that the truth of the Gospel is that Jesus was nonviolent and taught nonviolence as His way.”” In February 1976, he retired from the life of an active parish priest in the Diocese of Lansing and dedicated the remainder of his life to teaching the centrality of the nonviolent Jesus Christ of the Gospels and His Way of nonviolent love of friends and enemies for peace of soul, for peace among people and for the eternal salvation of all. He began and continued to ceaselessly insist that all the Churches of Christianity, by which he meant all Christians within all Christian churches, regardless of the rank each held in his or her Church, must begin to or return to following the Nonviolent Jesus of the Gospels and His Way of Nonviolent Love of all under all circumstances: ”\\"Until the various churches within Christianity repent and began to proclaim by word and deed what Jesus preached with relation to violence and enemies; there is not hope for anything other than escalating violence and destruction.”” ==“I was brainwashed. They told me it was necessary.”== In August 1980 ”Sojourners” magazine published an extensive interview with Rev. George Zabelka, titled “I was brainwashed. They told me it was necessary.” In the interview, he described the process of his conversion from a hard-core belief in the moral validity of Christian Just War Theory as a viable moral option for a disciple of Jesus to a full-fledged and public commitment to the nonviolent Jesus of the Gospels and his way of nonviolent love of friends and enemies. The interview was picked up and published in religious and non-religious journals and books throughout the world. Its considerable influence was immediate, and it extends to this day. One example of this is found in ”The Bishops and the Bomb”, James Castelli’s history of the U.S. Catholic Bishops’ Conference’s famous war-peace pastoral, The Challenge of Peace. Castelli writing about Bishop Frank Murphy, the sole initiator of the document that became The Challenge of Peace, and what influenced him to make this proposal to the U.S. Bishops says,”But the major influence on Murphy may have been Father George Zabelka, a Catholic priest, who as an Air Force chaplain had blessed the men who dropped the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, just as he had previously blessed the men who were inflicting massive bombing damage on the civilians of Tokyo. Murphy quoted from an interview with Zabelka in the evangelical Christian magazine, SOJOURNERS” (August, 1980). ”Fr. Zabelka: “I was brainwashed! It never entered my mind to publicly protest the consequences of these massive air raids. I was told the raids were necessary; told openly by the military and told implicitly by my Church’s leadership. To the best of my knowledge no American cardinals or bishops were opposing these mass air raids. Silence in such matters, especially by a public body like the American bishops, is a stamp of approval.”” ==Pilgrimage to Bethlehem== Also as a consequence of that article, Zabelka and a Jesuit priest, Jack Morris, planned, organized, and participated in the Bethlehem Peace Pilgrimage. This was a 7,500-mile (4,000 in the U.S, 3,500 in Europe) two-year walk on behalf of bringing God’s peace to humanity. It began in 1983, when walkers left the nuclear submarine base in Bangor, Washington, and it ended on Christmas Eve in 1984 in Bethlehem. Zabelka was 67 when he began this pilgrimage. In 1985, Fr. George Zabelka made a pilgrimage from Hiroshima to Nagasaki on the fortieth anniversary of the atomic bombings of those Japanese cities, as a way of asking those harmed by the bombings for forgiveness for himself and for his Church, ”“for bringing you death instead of the fullness of life, misery instead of mercy.”” As a tribute to Zabelka’s courage in admitting that he had made a grave moral mistake by his silence during the fire-bombings of Japan’s cities and the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and of Nagasaki, the renowned Australian folk singer, Peter Kearney, wrote and recorded a ballad, “My Name is George Zabelka” heard by tens of millions across the world, although never played on the secular or religious radio stations and networks in the United States. In 1988, a full-length documentary telling the story of Zabelka’s life and conversion was released in Great Britain. ””’The Reluctant Prophet”’” has been viewed worldwide and is used, to this day, in the religious education classes of many local churches as well as in local peace and justice programs. To this day, however, it has not ever been shown on U.S. public or private secular television, nor on U.S. Christian television networks. In his homily at a 1991 Mass celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of his ordination to the Catholic priesthood, Fr. Zabelka said, ”“I looked in the Catholic Bible. I looked in the Protestant Bible. I looked in the Orthodox Bible. And, in every one of them, there it was in no uncertain terms. Jesus saying ‘Love your enemies.’”” ==Death== Zabelka died in Flint, Michigan on April 11, 1992. He was buried on April 15, 1992, from Sacred Heart Church in Flint, in a funeral liturgy and Mass of the Resurrection. The Bishop of the diocese, Kenneth Povich, presided at the Mass, which was concelebrated by other bishops and many priests, with a congregation that greatly overflowed the capacity of the church. In his homily, Bishop Povish commented: ”“In our priestly gatherings, when we would concelebrate Mass together, at the prayers of petition Fr. George would always have us pray for our enemies.”” As he requested, Zabelka’s body is buried in the veterans’ section, Wing Victory II, at Crestwood Memorial Cemetery in Grand Blanc, Michigan. ==Documentaries== * The Reluctant Prophet, a one-hour British documentary on the life of Rev.

The film stars Vincent Cassel, Emmanuelle Bercot, Louis Garrel and Isild Le Besco (Maïwenn's sister). It was selected to compete for the Palme d'Or at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival. At Cannes, Bercot won the award for Best Actress. ==Plot== Tony (Emmanuelle Bercot) has a skiing accident that results in her injuring her knee. She goes to a seaside clinic to recover. While there her rehabilitation counsellor asks her to reflect on what led to her injury. Tony flashes back to her marriage with Georgio (Vincent Cassel). One night, while out with her brother and his girlfriend at a club, Tony sees Georgio, a man she recognizes. She flicks water from a champagne bucket in his face but he claims not to recognize her. Leaving the club Georgio invites Tony and her friends to his house. She reveals that they met while she was working her way through law school as a waitress and he used to flick water at women he would flirt with. Georgio is a restaurateur and Tony is impressed with his lifestyle and joie de vivre. On their second date he takes her, without warning, to his friend's wedding where he is serving as best man. They quickly begin dating although she is agitated when he introduces her to Agnès, a former model girlfriend who dislikes Tony and tells her she \\"stole\\" her boyfriend. Nevertheless, things continue to progress between the couple. Georgio suddenly tells Tony that he wants her to have his baby; he has decided that he is \\"ready\\". Tony becomes pregnant and the two marry. Agnès reacts to the news by attempting suicide. Georgio begins taking care of her and Tony feels he is more invested in Agnès than in their relationship. She leaves Georgio overnight though he promises her he'll stop seeing Agnès. Georgio tells Tony that because she walked out on him, he will now never stop taking care of Agnès and also tells Tony that he can't live with her 24/7. It will be better for their relationship for them to live separately, being together mainly for the good times. He rents an apartment across the street from their shared apartment which he moves into. While she is living alone a lawyer and movers come by to tell her that because Georgio is in severe debt many of their possessions, including ones that she brought to the marriage, are being taken away to be sold. Georgio regains her possessions and the two briefly reconcile in time for their son, Sinbad, to be born. Their marriage begins to fracture again when Georgio goes to see Agnès again and later introduces her to their son. He also claims to be working at times Tony needs him to watch their son however when Tony goes to his apartment she finds him in bed with a woman he claims not to know. He tells her that he has never cheated on her but admits to having a drug problem. Tony's brother tells her to leave Georgio but Tony argues that all marriages have their ups and downs and she is willing to continue trying. Tony begins to take medication in order to cope with her depression over her marriage. She begins to increase her dosage until she finally attempts suicide by taking all her pills. After her suicide attempt Tony finally decides to divorce Georgio but he refuses, especially after she tells him that he will only be able to see his son every other weekend. He threatens her by saying that he'll bring up her suicide attempt and her depression during her pregnancy in order to keep custody of their son to himself. Nevertheless, the two have an amicable divorce and continue to sleep together from time to time. While attending therapy Georgio apologizes to Tony for hurting her. The two take Sinbad on vacation together. Tony gets a high publicity case defending a murderer and she realizes that Georgio is not happy for her despite explaining to him that the case will make her career. Busy with her case, Tony is surprised by Georgio at her office one day who tells her he is afraid of losing her and that soon it will be their ten-year anniversary. He threatens her with physical violence. She tells him that he already lost her a long time ago, and that physical violence could not be worse than the emotional violence he has put her through. Leaving rehab, Tony returns to normal life where she goes to a parent-teacher interview. Georgio makes an appearance, and though it is clear they still care about each other and share a mutual attraction, they do not interact, and they do not engage in a fight or any of the passive-aggressive behaviour that marked so much of their relationship. Georgio leaves early, saying goodbye to the teachers but not directly to Tony, who smiles wistfully before turning back to the interview. == Cast Development== Maïwenn spent many years writing the script for the film which was loosely based on her relationship with real estate developer Jean-Yves Le Fur. Agnès was based on model Karen Mulder who was Le Fur's former fiancé and attempted suicide in 2002. Maïwenn wrote the role of Tony specifically with Emmanuelle Bercot in mind. Her first choice for the role of Georgio was Vincent Cassel but upon their initial meeting he was so negative about the script and about Georgio's roles that Maïwenn initially thought he was passing on the role. ==Critical reception== Review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes reports that 75% of critics have given the film a positive review, based on 44 reviews with an average rating of 6.7/10, the consensus being: \\"My King uses a medical catastrophe as the catalyst for a fully realized, thought-provoking look at love and co-dependency.\\" On Metacritic, the film has received a score of 64 out of 100 based on 13 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Ignatiy Vishnevetsky of The A.V. Club said that despite \\"parts of the film that are intriguing on their own...[Mon Roi] is overlong and overheated, suggesting a filmmaker who’s better at getting actors to yell at each other than at judging what’s essential.

The large height of the trees can be discerned when compared to the person standing in the trail. The Pioneer Mothers Memorial Forest is an 88-acre oak-hickory forest located in Orange County, Indiana, near Paoli. Identified as a surviving fragment of virgin Central Hardwood forest, a woodland type that largely vanished in the 1800s, it is a National Natural Landmark within the Hoosier National Forest. ==Description== The old-growth woodlot is characterized by mature stands of white ash, white oak, tuliptree, and black walnut. The United States Forest Service (USFS) has measured several of these trees at 60 feet to the first limb and 50 inches in diameter at breast height. As many of these trees were harvested in pioneer times for firewood or construction timber, the Pioneer Mothers Memorial Forest was a valuable relic by the time it was set aside for conservation in 1944. The Forest Service credits preservation of the mature woodlot to the Cox family. The land was patented in 1816 by Joseph Cox. Unlike most other timbered lands of southern Indiana, the Cox family never harvested the forest during the 124-year duration of family ownership. Upon the death of the last Cox owner in 1940, a preservation effort led to support for purchase of the land by the Forest Service. The USFS continues to manage the parcel for research and recreation purposes. Studies of the forest tract have uncovered a Native American bottomland village area with archeological remains dating to approximately 1380 CE.

Portrayed by Sophia Bush, she was introduced as a detective in the Intelligence Unit of the Chicago Police Department. ==Background and characterization== In season 1 of Chicago P.D., it has been established from the very beginning that Lindsay shared a special relationship with Hank Voight, head of the Intelligence Unit. Her unwavering loyalty to Voight is explained as her background is gradually revealed. She is generally unfazed by the gangsters, drug lords, and physically intimidating suspects the unit encounter on a regular basis. She has mentioned that her stepfather was in prison and that he would hit her and her mother, Bunny, who was an on-and-off drug addict. Through Bunny, she has a half-brother, Teddy Courtney, who was taken by a pedophilia ring at age 13 and was found by NYPD detectives ten years later working as a male prostitute. Lindsay grew up on the street and by the age of 14, she had already been arrested 5 times on charges including misdemeanor, simple battery, retail theft, solicitation, and unlawful possession of cannabis. She became a confidential informant for Voight, who, along with his wife, eventually took her in as her legal guardians. Actress Sophia Bush described the character: \\"Lindsay comes from the street so she already knows how all these people work.\\" She completed high school at St. Ignatius College Prep and joined the Chicago Police Department. After graduating from the police academy, she spent four years on the west side of Chicago as a patrol officer, which she said was all the education she needed. Because of her background, Lindsay is compassionate and sympathetic towards vulnerable young victims, especially girls, as she can relate with their situation. For example, she tries to get a 17-year-old prostitute and heroin addict, Nadia, to enter drug rehab twice. Eventually, she succeeds in convincing Nadia to stay clean and helps her get a desk job at 21st District headquarters. ==Character arc== Chicago Fire The character was first introduced in Chicago Fire, as one of the Chicago PD detectives the firefighters of 51 regularly come into contact with. She began a relationship with Kelly Severide, the lieutenant of Squad 3. They eventually break up when he spirals out of control following Leslie Shay's death. Chicago P.D. When Chicago P.D. premiered, it was established that she has been partnered with Jay Halstead for the past month. The first season coincided with the second season of Chicago Fire, during which she was still dating Lieutenant Kelly Severide from Squad 3. In season 2, Lindsay was recruited for a DEA task force. In the episode \\"Disco Bob\\", Lindsay becomes disillusioned with the task force, with its seemingly-endless bureaucracy and the menial tasks her handler assigned to her (she was to spend a number of weeks with the target's wife, simultaneously pumping her for information and keeping her out of the task force's way), leading her to resign and return to the Chicago PD and Intelligence. Lindsay's spiral downward begins with Nadia's death in the Law & Order: Special Victims Unit crossover episode \\"Daydream Believer\\". Nadia was an unfortunate victim of circumstances as she was murdered by sociopath Greg Yates, who had intended to target Lindsay. With this knowledge, Lindsay feels guilty and responsible. She begins drinking and becomes addicted to painkillers, egged on by her ne'er-do-well mother Bunny. In the season 2 finale \\"Born into Bad News\\", she turns in her badge and resigns; it is revealed in season 3 that Voight actually filed for a three- week sabbatical on her behalf instead of accepting a resignation. She returns in the season 3 premiere after learning that Halstead's undercover operation had been compromised and that he was being held hostage and tortured by a drug kingpin wanted by the Chicago PD. She gets clean, moves back in with Voight, and cuts Bunny out of her life as part of Voight's conditions for returning to Intelligence. Since breaking up with Severide, Lindsay's main love interest in the show is her partner Jay Halstead. They share a close friendship, which has escalated to a more intimate relationship and cooled down at various times, due to Voight's vocal dislike for \\"in-house\\" romances. However, regardless of the status of their relationship, they remained loyal to each other as partners on the job and friends outside of it. Halstead is the only character other than Voight she has confided her past to in detail; likewise, she is the only character other than Mouse and Halstead's brother Will who knows about his traumatic past in the military. When Lindsay was on the federal task force, she starts seeing Halstead after work as they no longer had to worry about breaking fraternization rules. In the season 3 premiere, Halstead is the only one who persistently tries to help her, even after Voight had given up. Following her return from her \\"sabbatical\\", Voight tells Halstead that he no longer cares about the status of latter and Lindsay's relationship as long as Halstead is looking out for her. After some hesitation, she agrees to take the next step, and they go public with their relationship for the first time by kissing at Molly's. In the beginning of season four, they move in together. In \\"Army of One\\", she sticks her gun down a pedophile's throat in the interrogation room when a kid is discovered to be found missing (and later found dead). In \\"Fork In The Road\\", she is brought to the review board when she was accused of assault. She leaves Chicago in \\"Fork in the Road\\" to join the FBI's New York Counter-terrorism Bureau in exchange for her mother's freedom after she is found in possession of pills that were stolen by her boyfriend and his associates. Erin is last seen looking at her cell phone when her boyfriend Jay calls. In \\"Chasing Monsters\\", offscreen Olinsky lets Lindsay know that the body of Kevin Bingham has resurfaced. In \\"Breaking Point\\", a witness identified Olinsky and Lindsay as the people that were digging near the site where the body was found.

French-Canadian trappers and fur traders arrived from the Hudson-Bay Company but soon were replaced by the American Fur Company. However, Lake Ann soon became a site for those interested in lumbering. During this time, towns and camps emerged. Lake Ann got its name from the wife of William S. Judd, an early settler. Early settlements were known for their local legends. Present day historical societies have collections of newspaper clippings and hand- written accounts describing celebrity trappers, lumberjacks, and river drovers. In the 1970s, the city of Chanhassen developed their first city park on the south shore of the lake known as Lake Ann Park. The park was built during a population growth spur.

A government review concluded that public servants were using their time and government resources to engage with ethnic communities for partisan purposes. An investigation by the RCMP and a special prosecutor also charged two Liberal party staffers with violations of the Elections Act in failing to disclose financial contributions for a byelection campaign. The trial was expected to proceed in 2015. == Disclosure == On February 27, 2013, the Official Opposition (the BC NDP) used Question Period in the legislature to make public some leaked documents that showed the governing Liberal Party had prepared a Multicultural Strategic Outreach Plan that targeted “quick wins”—such as official apologies for historical wrongs like the Komagata Maru incident—to gain support from ethnic communities through a potential mix of partisan and provincial government activities and resources. It referred to collecting lists of names from government programs for Liberal party use, preparing criticism of political opponents and stressed a need for secrecy and subterfuge by using personal email accounts, not government ones. Representatives of Chinese-Canadian, Indo-Canadian and other ethnic communities responded to the scandal due to perceiving the plan as being disrespectful, immoral and causing outrage. == Government review == Premier Christy Clark hosted an emergency cabinet meeting. Clark repeatedly apologized in the legislature for the issue, calling it ‘a very serious mistake.’ On February 28, 2013, Premier Clark and her cabinet ministers directed John Dyble, who was Deputy Minister to the Premier, Cabinet Secretary and Head of the BC Public Service, to investigate whether government resources were inappropriately used or the Public Service Act violated in development and implementation of the Liberal Party’s Multicultural Strategic Outreach Plan. Dyble’s review conducted 27 interviews and gathered approximately 10,000 pages of documents, including government records from personal e-mail accounts, for events beginning as early as March 2011. The review concluded Kim Haakstad, the Premier’s Deputy Chief of Staff, made a “serious breach of the Standards of Conduct” by managing a meeting on December 1, 2011 to exchange information and plan coordination for multicultural outreach between six government employees (including Brian Bonney and Pamela Martin) and five BC Liberal party and caucus staff (including former MLA Lorne Mayencourt). Several participants described the focus of the meeting as unclear whether it was for government or partisan purposes. The resulting work plan caused hiring of community liaison contractors that lacked a clear distinction between being government or Liberal party caucus contractors. The report concluded two public servants breached government procurement standards in assisting applicants to make submissions. The report also said that up to half of Brian Bonney’s government-paid time as a ministry communications director was actually used to do partisan work for the Liberal Party. Premier Clark, MLAs Harry Bloy and John Yap were interviewed as part of the review and stated they had never seen the draft strategy or work plan documents until they were made public in February 2013. == Impacts == Dyble’s review recommended clarification of public servants’ standards of conduct and use of government e-mail accounts for government-related work. A public apology in the legislature for the Chinese Head Tax had been planned for March 14, 2013 but was postponed until the next legislative session due to the release of the Dyble review on that date.  Resignations  Shortly before the plan was made public by the NDP, Brian Bonney had resigned as communications director for multiculturalism. Given the conclusion of Dyble’s review that Bonney spent up to half of his government-paid time working on partisan activities, the BC Liberal Party repaid $70,000 to the government. Shortly after the plan became public, Haakstad resigned from being Premier Clark’s Deputy Chief of Staff. She later volunteered to assist Clark’s unsuccessful campaign to be re-elected as MLA for Vancouver-Point Grey. Due to the ongoing investigation by Dyble, Yap resigned as Minister of Advanced Education, Innovation and Technology and Minister Responsible for Multiculturalism on March 4, 2013. He had justified the use of personal e-mail accounts by public servants and politicians to prevent release of the information under the Freedom of Information Act. Yap was then re-elected as MLA for Richmond-Steveston two months after resigning from cabinet.  2013 election campaigns  Prior to the May election, two outgoing Liberal MLAs, Kash Heed and Dave Hayer, both Indo-Canadians, called the plan insulting and demanded those responsible be held accountable. Dave Hayer’s criticism of his party’s work on the Quick Wins strategy: This proposed outreach plan was insulting to the intended targeted communities and was, when I found out about it, insulting to me and to all other MLAs who believe in doing things properly, fairly and within the rules and laws of the legislature… Nobody in their right mind would be telling anybody to do anything like this. I can tell you, all the MLAs I talked to think this is wrong. We think whoever did this should be held responsible. Some Liberal riding associations lost members and a group of 89 party members made a public call for the resignation of Clark. In the lead-up to the May 2013 election, the Quick Wins scandal was credited as a factor in Christy Clark ‘s trailing Adrian Dix by 20 points in polls. However on election day, the majority of voters continued to support the Liberal party.  Special prosecution  In August 2013, three months after the NDP’s election loss, Opposition leader Adrian Dix sent correspondence to the RCMP calling for an investigation based on alleged new information. In 2014, special prosecutor David Butcher approved charges against Brian Bonney and Liberal party staffer Mark Robertson for violating the provincial Election Act due to an alleged failure to disclose a $2,240 campaign contribution to the Liberal party during the spring 2012 byelection in Port Moody-Coquitlam. Sepideh Sarrafpour, a BC Liberal caucus ethnic outreach contractor from October 2011 to October 2012, was expected to be a witness in the trial due to attempts by the accused in involving her in the by-election campaign. Her possible involvement was made public by inclusion of an e-mail from Brian Bonney in the Dyble review: Have [MLA] Harry Bloy meet with her and explain how doing anything would damage the Premier and the party. Have him say how he will try to find her work and get her back involved... If need be, offer x dollars per month to do non public work up to election [developing her database of potential supporters]. == References  External links == * Review of the Draft Multicultural Strategic Outreach Plan (pdf) Category:British Columbia political scandals Category:Trials of political people ","title":"Quick Wins ethnic outreach scandal"},{"id":"46384794","text":"Lake Lucy is a lake in Carver County, Minnesota, in the United States.

He was also a campaigner for better architectural education and professional status. St John's Church, Farsley, designed by William Wallen, built in 1842. == Biography == William Wallen, the son of John Wallen (1785-1865) and Maria Adams (1780-1825) was baptised at St. Marys, Stepney in 1807.St Marys Register 26 Apr 1807 William received architectural training from his father. In 1830, William married Frances Gill (1802-1895) England, Marriages, 1538–1973. Available, FamilySearch, 2013, Film Number: 1470803 Reference ID: p.192 cn.575 and the following year, their son, William Sowerby Wallen, was baptised at Whitechapel, London.London Metropolitan Archives, Whitechapel St Mary, Register of Baptism, p93/mry1, Item 075 They lived with John Wallen’s extended family in various homes in and around Norton Folgate, London. In 1838, William moved his practice to Huddersfield, Yorkshire. Frances had been born in nearby Notton,Royston parish record: 1802, Gill and Atkinson. therefore, family connections may have influenced this move. By 1851, William, Frances, their son, William Sowerby and niece, Julia Gill, were living at 61 New North Rd, Huddersfield.1851 census During 1853, William ceased to practice and it was later assumed by most historians that he had died.Jones G. 2015, ‘William Wallen (1807- ) The Renowned Architect Rediscovered’, Brisbane: Ancestry, 1-2. Statements made by civic leaders at this point in time indicate that William was highly regarded in both Huddersfield and within architectural circles; therefore, it is probable that his fate was not openly discussed. In reality, William was admitted to the Bootham Lunatic Hospital in September 1853 and remained a patient there until his death in 1888, aged 81 years.Yorkshire Archive - Bootham Yorkshire York BOO/39/82 The exact nature of William’s condition is not recorded; however, he apparently retained his research and communication skills. In 1871, taking part in Bootham’s regular ‘programme of entertainments’ he delivered a lecture to his fellow inmates entitled, An Analysis of the Franco-Prussian War.Wilkins E.T. 1871, Insanity and Insane Asylums,Report by Wilkins, Commissioner for Lunacy in the State of California, made to his Excellency H.H.Haight, Governor. California: Springer,296. Frances supported herself as a schoolteacher; she died, aged 93, in Leeds.Record, West Riding Volume: 9b Page: 290. William Sowerby Wallen (1831-1870), became a Surgeon, practicing in Rotherhithe and also serving as Vice Surgeon to the 23rd Surrey Rifle Volunteer Corps. He died in Natal, South Africa.The Medical Register -UK 1859, p. 310; London Gazettes 1861 and 1865. == Architectural career == William Wallen received comprehensive tutelage in the office of his father, John Wallen, who was an Architect and the Principal Surveyor in London in the 1830s. William probably completed his training in 1828; however, there is no evidence that he undertook any independent projects during the following ten years.Webster, C. (2010). \\"An alternative to Ecclesiology: William Wallen (1807–53)\\". In G. Brandwood. Seven Church Architects 1830-1930, Ecclesiology To-day. London: Ecclesiological Society. By 1831, John Wallen, William Wallen and William Beatson had formed a partnership that remained intact until 1836, when the firm ‘Wallen, Son and Beatson’ provided a substantial estimate for repairs to the fire damaged Christ Church in Spitalfields.Sheppard F.H.W.(ed.), Survey of London, Spitalfields (London, 1957), vol. XXVII, On 24 March 1836, by mutual consent, Beatson withdrew from the partnership.The London Gazette-part one, 1836, p.571. During the partnership, William appears to have gained some autonomy allowing him to also pursue his antiquarian and educational interests. In 1838, he appeared in Huddersfield, Yorkshire, becoming the town’s only qualified architect.Law, Edward (2009). \\"Architects of Huddersfield & District to 1860\\". Huddersfield & District History. Retrieved 26 March 2015. William’s career flourished. His many projects included the building of six new churches: * 1838–40, St David, Holmbridge, near Huddersfield * 1842-3 St John the Evangelist Church, Farsley, Bradford * 1843-5 St Luke's Church, Milnsbridge, Huddersfield, * 1844–6 Christ Church, Oakworth, Keighley, * 1845-7 St Nicholas, Whitehaven, Cumbria (Cumberland). * 1845-8 St Paul's Church, Shepley, Huddersfield.Webster C.(2010) Other Projects: * 1840 Report for Clarke-Thornhill family re. condition of roofs at Fixby Hall * 1843 National School and Master's House, Kirkheaton. * 1846 Riding School, Huddersfield. * 1848 Longley Hall Estate Office. * 1849 George Hotel, Huddersfield.

(ed.) 1992, Huddersfield: A Most Handsome Town – Aspects of the History and Culture of a West Yorkshire Town. Huddersfield: Kirklees MC. Charles Child’s role in the George Hotel project is disputed, being variously described as Wallen’s clerk, contractor or contributing architect. Child completed the Aspley Lecture Room.Gibson K. & Booth A. 2009, The Buildings of Huddersfield, Gloustershire: History Press == Art and publication == Between 1828 and 1833 William Wallen exhibited artwork at the Royal Academy, London. Unlike other exhibiting architects, William described himself as a ‘painter’. His exhibits included several depictions medieval buildings,Webster C.(2010) Dover Castle Graves, A. 1906, The Royal Academy of Arts; A Complete Dictionary 1769 to 1904 , Vol VIII, London: Graves & Bell. and four views being part of a series depicting the demolition of old London Bridge.Academy of Arts 1832, The Exhibition of the Royal Academy, London: W Clowes In 1836, William published The History and Antiquities of the Round Church at Little Maplestead, Essex. His work was dedicated to Rev. William Sowerby, Curate of St. Bridgets, Beckermet, Cumberland and was supported by 510 subscribers including several notable architects.Wallen, W. 1836, The History and Antiquities of the Round Church at Little Maplestead, Essex, London: Maurice Clarke & Co. . Also available, https://archive.org/details/historyantiquiti00wall A review, published in J.C. Loudon’s Architectural Magazine(1836), considered the work to have little value from an architectural point of view. Nevertheless, the reviewer declared that Wallen’s extensive topographical history and account of the Crusades were “both instructive and entertaining”. Contemporary historians suggest that Wallen’s Little Maplestead has considerable antiquarian merit.Webster C.(2010) == Contributions to the architectural profession == Wallen had a close association with fellow architects, Edward Cresy (1792–1858) and George Ledwell Taylor (1888–1873). They would have shared an interest in professional groups such as the Architectural Society that were developing in the 1830s. In 1834, Cresy and Taylor were founding members of the Institute of British Architects (IBA) which later became the RIBA. With Cresy and Taylor as referees, Wallen became a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, in 1835.Webster C.(2010) These fledgling institutes were fertile ground for the ‘Battle of the Styles’ of the Victorian era, when Gothic and Classical architectural styles were selectively celebrated or reviled. Cresy resigned from the IBA soon after its inception, lamenting the opprobrium that was pervading his profession: “I laid the foundations with my friend Wallen for a society of men who would act in concert”.Burfield D 2003, Edward Cresy (1792-1858), Architect and Civil Engineer, London: Shaun Tyas Wallen concurred with Cresy’s sentiments in his lecture On Prejudice as to Style in Architecture, delivered to the Architectural Society in January 1838. Wallen mocked the prejudice and animosity pervading the architectural profession, encapsulating this absurdity in the following line: “the rose is a beautiful flower, but as a lily is not LIKE a rose, it is not beautiful”.Wallen W. 1838 Lecture ‘On Prejudice as to Style in Architecture’. Civil Engineer and Architect's Journal, Vol 1, 156. This factionalism may have motivated Wallen to move to Huddersfield. Undaunted, he established the Yorkshire Architectural Society and remained an active member during the 1840s.Webster C.(2010) ==References== Category:19th-century English architects Category:1807 births Category:1888 deaths ","title":"William Wallen (architect)"},{"id":"46384811","text":"Ibalonius bimaculatus is a species of harvestmen from the family Podoctidae.

In 1852 the board was replaced by a new one and in 1863 a new body was formed. As per old records, in 1872 there were 25 wards in Kolkata (spellings as in use at that time) – 1. Shyampukur, 2. Kumartuli, 3. Bartala, 4. Sukea Street, 5. Jorabagan, 6. Jorasanko, 7. Barabazar, 8. Kolutola, 9. Muchipara, 10. Boubazar, 11. Padmapukur, 12. Waterloo Street, 13. Fenwick Bazar, 14. Taltala, 15. Kalinga, 16. Park Street, 17. Victoria Terrace, 18. Hastings, 19. Entali, 20. Beniapukur, 21. Baliganj-Tollyganj, 22. Bhabanipur, 23. Alipur, 24.Ekbalpur and 25. Watganj. A new municipal corporation was created in 1876, wherein 48 commissioners were elected and 24 were appointed by the government. With the implementation of the Municipal Consolidation Act of 1888 the area under the jurisdiction of the municipal corporation was enlarged. Certain areas were already there but more parts of them were added (current spellings) - Entally, Manicktala, Beliaghata, Ultadanga, Chitpur, Cossipore, Beniapukur, Ballygunge, Watganj and Ekbalpur, and Garden Reach and Tollygunj. The Calcutta Municipal Act of 1923 brought about important changes. It liberalised the constitution along democratic lines.Bagchi, Amiya Kumar, Wealth and Work in Calcutta, 1860-1921, in Calcutta, the Living City, Vol. I, edited by Sukanta Chaudhuri, p. 213-215, Oxford University Press, . The state government superseded the Corporation in 1948 and the Calcutta Municipal Act of 1951 came into force. Adult franchise was introduced in municipal elections in 1962. With the addition of certain areas in the southern parts of the city, the number of wards increased from 75 to 144. ==Geography== Ward No. 39 is bordered on the north by Muktaram Babu Street; on the east by Bidhan Sarani; on the south by Mahatma Gandhi Road; and on the west by Chittaranjan Avenue.Kolkata: Detail Maps of 141 Wards with Street Directory.

McNair graduated in 1968 from Alpena High School in Boone County and has since 1983 operated Ron's Auto Service there. He is the father of two and lives in Alpena with his wife, the former Phyllis Snow. He is a former member of the Alpena Town Council and School Board. In 2002, he was the president of the Arkansas School Board Association. He is a member of the advisory board of North Arkansas College in Harrison. He is the president of the Alpena Cemetery Board. He is affiliated with the Chamber of Commerce, the American Farm Bureau Federation, and the National Rifle Association. He is a member of the Church of Christ denomination. In 2014, McNair entered the Republican primary held on May 20 to choose a successor to the term-limited John Burris of Harrison, who ran unsuccessfully for a seat in the Arkansas State Senate. McNair won the nomination by 36 votes over intra- party rival, Jeff Leonard Boggs (born c. 1969) of Green Forest in Carroll County, 1,344 (50.7 percent) to 1,308 (49.3 percent). He was then unopposed in the November 4 general election. McNair is assigned to the House committees on: (1) Agriculture, Forestry and Economic Development, (2) Public Transportation, and (3) Legislative Joint Auditory Committee. In February 2015, McNair supported House Bill 1228, sponsored by Bob Ballinger of Carroll County, which sought to prohibit government from imposing a burden on the free exercise of religion. The measure passed the House, seventy-two to twenty. One of the opponents, Democratic Representative Camille Bennett, a former city attorney for Lonoke, Arkansas, called for a reworking of the legislation. Bennett claimed the Ballinger bill would establish a \\"type of religious litmus test\\" which could impact nearly any law under consideration by the legislature. The measure was subsequently passed by a large margin in the House and signed into law in revised form, SB 975, by Governor Asa Hutchinson. That same month, McNair joined dozens of his fellow Republicans and two Democrats in co-sponsoring legislation submitted by Representative Lane Jean of Magnolia, to reduce unemployment compensation benefits. The measure was promptly signed into law by Governor Hutchinson. ==References== Category:1950 births Category:Living people Category:People from Boone County, Arkansas Category:Alpena High School (Arkansas) alumni Category:Businesspeople from Arkansas Category:American members of the Churches of Christ Category:Members of the Arkansas House of Representatives Category:Arkansas city council members Category:School board members in Arkansas Category:Arkansas Republicans Category:21st-century American politicians ","title":"Ron McNair (politician)"},{"id":"46385001","text":"Andi Bakiasi (born 2 October 1988) is an Albanian footballer who currently plays as a defender for Shkumbini in the Albanian First Division.Soccerway profileFootballdatabase profileFSHF profile ==References== Category:1988 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Lushnjë Category:Albanian footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:KS Lushnja players Category:KF Skrapari players Category:KF Teuta Durrës players Category:FK Tomori Berat players Category:Luftëtari Gjirokastër players Category:KS Shkumbini Peqin players Category:KS Egnatia Rrogozhinë players Category:Albanian Superliga players ","title":"Andi Bakiasi"},{"id":"46385011","text":"First lieutenant Duane Francies (July 15, 1921 – May 5, 2004) was a military aviator who earned the Distinguished Flying Cross for his service. ==Early life== He was the only son of Merritt Charles Francies and Kathleen Horan Francies.

It is very similar to Melaleuca subfalcata, varying mainly in the length of its stamens and styles. Like M. subfalcata, it has pink to mauve flowers and leaves that are very hairy when young but become glabrous when mature. ==Description== Melaleuca ochroma is a shrub growing to about tall with hard, fibrous bark. Its leaves are narrow oval shaped and covered with soft hairs when young but become glabrous with age and eventually linear in shape, slightly dished and with a sharp point on the end. Mature leaves are arranged alternately on the stem and are long and about wide. The flowers are pink at first but fade to pale mauve, arranged on spikes wide in the axils of the leaves, each spike with 17 to 35 individual flowers. The petals are long and fall off as the flower matures. The stamens are arranged in five bundles around the flower, each bundle containing 13 to 24 stamens. The stamens are long and the styles are long. (In Melaleuca subfalcata, the stamens and styles are longer.) Flowering occurs in late spring and is followed by fruit which are woody cup-shaped capsule long with a fairly smooth rim. ==Taxonomy and naming== Melaleuca ochroma was first described as a new species in 2000 by Brendan Lepschi. The specific epithet (ochroma) is from the Greek ochroma meaning \\"pallor\\" in reference to the pale colour of the flowers. ==Distribution and habitat== Melaleuca ochroma occurs in the Mount Holland - Hyden district in the Coolgardie and Mallee biogeographic regions. ==Conservation== Melaleuca ochroma is listed as \\"Priority Three\\" Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife meaning that it is only known from a few locations but is not under imminent threat. ==References== ochroma Category:Myrtales of Australia Category:Plants described in 2000 Category:Endemic flora of Western Australia ","title":"Melaleuca ochroma"},{"id":"46385077","text":"Alban Bizhyti (born 8 March 1984) is an Albanian professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Albanian club Shkumbini Peqin in the Albanian Second Division.Footballdatabase profile ==Club career== Bizhyti is a product of Lushnja academy; he made his professional debut on 13 April 2002 in a league match against Flamurtari Vlorë, scoring a goal only nine minute after coming on as a substitute.

Nevitt was born at Crewe, Cheshire, to James Nevitt and his wife Ellen (née Warburton) and was educated in Crewe Green and St. Paul's Church schools, Crewe. He began his working life as a railway fitter in England before moving to Queensland around 1884. He worked as a hospital wardsman in Normanton for twenty years from 1887, was overseer, Townsville Quarantine Station from 1912 until 1917, and Visiting Justice at St Helena Prison and other centres throughout the state from 1923 to 1930. ==Political career== Nevitt entered the Queensland Parliament at the 1907 state election. Standing as the Labour candidate for the seat of Carpentaria, he defeated the sitting member, James Forsyth. He held the seat for five years until it was abolished in 1912. When the Labour Party starting forming governments in Queensland, it found much of its legislation being blocked by a hostile Council, where members had been appointed for life by successive conservative governments. After a failed referendum in May 1917, Premier Ryan tried a new tactic, and later that year advised the Governor, Sir Hamilton John Goold-Adams, to appoint thirteen new members whose allegiance lay with Labour to the Council.Goold-Adams, Sir Hamilton John (1858–1920) – Australian Dictionary of Biography. Retrieved 12 April 2015. Nevitt was one of the thirteen new members, and went on to serve for four and a half years until the Council was abolished in March 1922. From 17 November 1920 he was also the Chairman of Committees. ==Personal life== Nevitt married Sabina Naughton in 1887 and together had 3 sons. He retired in March 1932. About July 1932, he travelled to Cairns where he died in a private hospital in September 1932. His funeral was held at St John's Church, Cairns and proceeded to the Martyn St Cemetery.Grave of Thomas Nevitt in Cairns Martyn Street Cemetery ==References== Category:Members of the Queensland Legislative Assembly Category:Members of the Queensland Legislative Council Category:1864 births Category:1932 deaths Category:Australian Labor Party members of the Parliament of Queensland Category:People from Crewe ","title":"Thomas Nevitt"},{"id":"46385083","text":"Tom Herbert (November 25, 1888 - April 3, 1946) was an American character actor of the 1930s and 1940s. ==Biography== Born in New York City on November 25, 1888, Herbert broke into the film industry in RKO's Traveling Husbands (1931).

Promoter Fritz Von Erich held two \\"Wrestling Star Wars\\" events, one in March and one in August as well as a special \\"Christmas Star Wars\\" on December 25 of that year. The driving storyline behind both the second and third Star Wars show of 1982 was Von Erich's son Kerry Von Erich's quest to defeat Ric Flair for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, a quest that was ultimately unsuccessful due to the Fabulous Freebirds turning on the Von Erich family, starting the most well known storyline in WCCW as the Von Erichs and the Freebirds fought for years following the December Christmas Star Wars. ==Wrestling Star Wars (March)== Wrestling Star Wars (March 1982) was a professional wrestling supercard show that was held on March 15, 1982 The show was produced and scripted by the Dallas, Texas based World Class Championship Wrestling (WCCW) professional wrestling promotion and held in their home area, Dallas/Ft. Worth, Texas. Several matches from the show were taped for WCCW's television shows and broadcast in the weeks following the show. The show was the fourth overall show in the \\"Wrestling Star Wars\\" event chronology. The show was held at the Fort Worth Convention Center. Results ==Wrestling Star Wars (August)== Wrestling Star Wars (August 1982) was a professional wrestling supercard show that was held on August 15, 1982. The show was produced and scripted by the Dallas, Texas based World Class Championship Wrestling (WCCW) professional wrestling promotion and held in their home area, Dallas/Ft. Worth, Texas. Several matches from the show were taped for WCCW's television shows and broadcast in the weeks following the show. The show was the fifth overall show in the \\"Wrestling Star Wars\\" event chronology. The show, held at the Fort Worth Convention Center, drew 18,000 spectators, the maximum capacity of the Conventions center when configured for wrestling shows. The main event of the show was National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) World Heavyweight Champion Ric Flair defending the championship against Kerry Von Erich in a \\"Best two-out-of-three\\" falls match. Flair won the first fall on a DQ after Kerry accidentally hit special appointed NWA referee Alfred Neely with a discus punch, while Von Erich won the second fall by pinfall with the Iron Claw. In the third and final fall Ric Flair and Kerry Von Erich battled to a Double Disqualification. Results ==Christmas Star Wars== World Class Championship Wrestling (WCCW) held their second annual Christmas Star Wars, a major professional wrestling show held on December 25 each year from 1981 through 1987. Some of the matches on the show were taped and later shown on television as part of WCCW's weekly shows. The focal point of the show was promoter Fritz Von Erich's son Kerry Von Erich challenging Ric Flair for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship in the main event. The fifth and the eight match of the night were both shown on WCCW television programs on December 27, 1982 and the main event match between Von Erich and Flair was the focus of the WCCW television show on December 28, 1982. These episodes were later made available as part of the WWE Network. One of the undercard matches was a six- man tag team match to determine the first ever holders of the WCCW Six-Man Tag Team Championship as the team of the Fabulous Freebirds (Michael Hayes, Terry Gordy and Buddy Roberts) were slated to take on the team of Tom Steele Mike and Ben Sharpe representing Canada in the tournament. Prior to the match Michael Hayes announced that due to bad winter weather Buddy Roberts was not in the building. Following that announcement David Von Erich came to the ring and offered to team with the Freebirds. Von Erich and the Freebirds won the match and the championship, after which Von Erich relinquished his part of the championship to Buddy Roberts. The final match of the show was actually shown on TV before WCCW showed the match between Ric Flair and Kerry Von Erich, allowing them to dedicate the entire December 28 episode to the match between Ric Flair and Kerry Von Erich. At the August Wrestling Star Wars Ric Flair had managed to escape the match against Kerry Von Erich with the championship still in his possession. Following that show the storyline was that Ric Flair had offered a bounty to anyone who could injure Kerry Von Erich. The Great Kabuki collected the bounty as he hurt Von Erich's knee, giving them a storyline reason to cover for Von Erich's legitimate knee surgery. The Championship rematch was made into a Steel Cage Match and Fritz Von Erich decided to add a special guest referee to ensure everything was handled fairly. WCCW held a write in vote to determine the referee with the fans choosing Fabulous Freebird member Michael Hayes for the job alongside regular referee David Manning. After the introductions Terry Gordy came to ring side to hold the key that locked the steel cage door, to ensure that no one could get in and attack Von Erich who was a close friend of the Freebirds. During the match Von Erich applied the Iron Claw to Flair and held it for several minutes. During the hold Hayes thought that Flair had his foot under the bottom rope, a call that David Manning disagreed with, but Hayes made Von Erich break the claw hold anyway. Once he realized what he had done Hayes appeared to be upset and struck Ric Flair, knocking him down. When Hayes urged Von Erich to pin Flair Von Erich refused, which upset Hayes greatly. This led to Hayes leaving the cage while Von Erich tried to stop him. Moments later Terry Gordy slammed the door shut on Kerry Von Erich, striking him in the face and cementing that the Freebirds had just turned on their long time friend. Hayes returned moments later and counted Von Erich's shoulders down even though he clearly kicked out at 2. Subsequently David Manning ejected the Freebirds and announced that the match was not over. Minutes later Manning had no choice but to call for the bell as a bloodied Kerry Von Erich was unable to continue. The circumstances around the match was the start of the storyline feud between the Freebirds and the Von Erich family that would last for several years and has been the focal point of several DVD features such as \\"Heroes of World Class Wrestling: the Story of the Von Erichs\\" in 2007 and \\"The Triumph and Tragedy of World Class Championship Wrestling\\" released in 2011. ;Battle Royal order of elimination {  width=50% !style=\\"background: #e3e3e3;\\"# !style=\\"background: #e3e3e3;\\"Eliminated !style=\\"background: #e3e3e3;\\"Way of elimination !style=\\"background: #e3e3e3;\\"Reference -   David Von Erich  Over the top rope  -   King Kong Bundy  Over the top rope  -   Ben Sharpe  Pinned  -   Jose Lothario  Over the top rope  -   The Checkmate  Over the top rope  -   Frank Dusek  Over the top rope  -   The Spoiler  Over the top rope  -   Bill Irwing  Over the top rope  -   Bugsy McGraw  Over the top rope  - 10  Magic Dragon  Pinned  - 11  Bob Steel  Over the top rope  - 12  Al Madrill  Over the top rope  - 13  Brian Adias, Johnny Mantell and Mike Sharpe  Survivors  } ==References== Category:1982 in professional wrestling Category:World Class Championship Wrestling shows Category:1982 in Texas Category:Events in Dallas Category:Professional wrestling in the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex Category:March 1982 events in the United States Category:August 1982 events in the United States Category:December 1982 events in the United States ","title":"WCCW Star Wars (1982)"},{"id":"46385221","text":"Viktor Gjyla (born 11 May 1982) is an Albanian footballer who currently plays as a defender for Shkumbini Peqin in the Albanian Second Division.Soccerway profileFootballdatabase profileFSHF profile ==References== Category:1982 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Lushnjë Category:Albanian footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:KS Lushnja players Category:KS Egnatia Rrogozhinë players Category:FK Partizani Tirana players Category:KS Shkumbini Peqin players Category:FK Tomori Berat players Category:Albanian Superliga players Category:Albanian First Division players Category:Albanian Second Division players ","title":"Viktor Gjyla"},{"id":"46385228","text":"Barnes Lake is a lake in Carver County, Minnesota, in the United States.

As Jews, the family immigrated to Germany because of the growing anti-Semitism after the failed revolution of 1905 in the Russian Empire. Klarwein studied architecture at the Technical University of Munich from 1917-1919, but he was not awarded a university degree. In 1920, he studied with Hans Poelzig in the master's studio for architecture of the Prussian Academy of Arts in Berlin. In 1921, Klarwein joined the architectural firm of Fritz Höger in Hamburg.

Klarwein changed his first name from the Slavic name variant Ossip to the Hebrew form Yosseph. In Haifa, Klarwein became an independent architect. Most of his works are public and commercial buildings, as well as development plans for cities and neighborhoods scattered throughout Israel.

The Most Good You Can Do: How Effective Altruism Is Changing Ideas About Living Ethically is a 2015 Yale University Press book by moral philosopher and bioethicist Peter Singer describing and arguing for the ideas of effective altruism. As a follow-up to The Life You Can Save, which makes the moral argument for donating money to improve the lives of people in extreme poverty, the new book focuses on the broader question of how to do the most good. ==Reception== Interviews Oliver Milman interviewed Peter Singer about the book for The Guardian shortly before the book's release. Hamilton Nolan interviewed Singer for Gawker a week after the release. Singer was also interviewed on ABC Online (an Australian media network) about his book. He also did a longer interview with the Melbourne radio channel of the network. Singer also participated in an Ask Me Anything on Reddit, fielding questions about his book, on April 14, 2015 (a week after the book's release). Book reviews Nicholas Kristof reviewed the book for The New York Times, beginning with a discussion of the earning to give strategy. Kristof had three reservations about the book: (1) it's not clear where to draw the line with respect to altruism, (2) in addition to humanitarian motives, loyalty is also important and many give to universities or the arts out of loyalty, (3) the idea of taking a job solely because it is well-paying made him flinch. Kristof concluded on a positive note: \\"Singer's argument is powerful, provocative and, I think, basically right. The world would be a better place if we were as tough-minded in how we donate money as in how we make it.\\" University of Chicago Law School professor Eric Posner reviewed the book for Slate Magazine, concluding: \\"So what's an effective altruist to do? The utilitarian imperative to search out and help the people with the highest marginal utility of money around the world is in conflict with our limited knowledge about foreign cultures, which makes it difficult for us to figure out what the worst-off people really need. For this reason, donations to Little League and other local institutions you are familiar with may not be a bad idea. The most good you can do may turn out to be—not much.\\" Posner wrote a follow-up post on his personal blog, stressing that in his view Singer's main weakness was that he didn't spend enough time working through the ramifications of the importance of institutions. Minal Bopaiah wrote a blog post favorably reviewing the book for PSI Impact, a website maintained by Population Services International. PSI was one of many charities discussed by Singer in his book as potentially effective places to donate to. John Abdulla reviewed the book on Oxfam's blog, concluding: \\"And so the question that remains for me, as I think more about the ideas laid out in this book, is how can I challenge myself to do more good in this world?\\" Glenn C. Altschuler, professor of American Studies at Cornell University, reviewed the book for Philly.com, concluding: \\"Singer opens up worthwhile conversations (and practical applications) related to ethical ideals.

Starting at 8:30 p.m. and ending at 11:00 p.m. Eastern time, it aired on CNN and was broadcast on radio by Westwood One. Anderson Cooper was the moderator of the debate, with Dana Bash and Juan Carlos Lopez asking additional questions and Don Lemon presenting questions submitted by voters via Facebook. To be invited to the debate, a candidate had to achieve an average of at least 1% in three recognized national polls released between August 1 and October 10. In addition, a candidate had to either file a statement of candidacy with the Federal Election Commission or declare that one would be filed by October 14, the day after the debate. The latter criterion would have accommodated Vice President Joe Biden had he decided to enter the presidential race as late as the day of the debate. CNN had an extra lectern available to install for Biden, but he took no action to enter the campaign before the debate. Analysis on the debate was largely mixed regarding who, between the top two candidates, won. Some analysts from CNN and BBC viewed Clinton as the winner, while other publications such as The Washington Post, The Chicago Tribune, and the Fox News Channel, claimed that Sanders was the winner. Conversely, Chafee, O'Malley and Webb were all widely regarded as the \\"losers\\". One of the most memorable moments from the debate, which drew an average of 15.3 million viewers, a record for a Democratic debate, came when Sanders replied to a question about Clinton's email controversy that the American people were \\"sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails\\", which drew cheers and applause from the audience and a smile and handshake between the two candidates. With regard to social media, Sanders had the biggest gains of the night on Twitter and Facebook, with an increase of 46,000 new followers and 35,000 new likes, respectively; over the course of the night, he was also the most-searched candidate on Google. Conversely, Clinton had the biggest gains on Instagram, with 25,000 likes for her photograph of her podium just before the debate started. It was noted that Republican frontrunner Donald Trump, who was live- Tweeting during the entire debate and mocking the candidates, gained more Twitter followers over the course of the night than all of the five candidates combined, with over 70,000 new followers. With the focus primarily being on Clinton and Sanders, a majority of subsequent fact-checking in the aftermath of the debate was regarding comments made by the two of them. Fact-checking by the Associated Press and USA Today pointed out mistakes in both of their presentations: specifically, Clinton was considered inconsistent in many of her policy stances, particularly with regard to the Obama administration's handling of the Syrian Civil War as well as the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement that Clinton supported as Secretary of State, but changed to opposing while a candidate. In contrast, Sanders was pointed out as making economic claims based on outdated information, particularly with regard to how much of America's GDP actually goes to the wealthiest in the country. This was the first and only debate appearance of Chafee and Webb, who ended their campaigns on October 23 and October 20, respectively. * Saturday November 14, 2015 – Des Moines, Iowa { class=\\" sortable floatright\\" !

Polls - Clinton38:33 54.7% - Sanders24:17 33.0% -  O'Malley  21:28  2.7% } The Democratic Party's second presidential debate ahead of the 2016 U.S. presidential election was held on November 14, 2015, at the Sheslow Auditorium at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa. It aired on CBS News and was also be broadcast by KCCI and The Des Moines Register. This was the first debate to be broadcast over nationwide network television, the previous debate having gone over cable. CBS News Political Director John Dickerson was the principal moderator, with participation by Kevin Cooney of KCCI. The day before the debate, November 13, was the day of the November 2015 Paris attacks, where nearly 130 civilians were killed by radical Jihadist terrorists - specifically, members of ISIS - across the city of Paris. As a result of the attacks, after initial speculation that the debate might be cancelled, CBS announced that, while the debate would go on as planned, the focus of the debate's content would be dramatically shifted over to foreign policy and terrorism. In addition, a moment of silence was held at the beginning of the debate in memory of the victims. One of the most memorable moments of the debate was when Clinton defended against claims that she had ties to Wall Street bankers, particularly when Sanders pointed out that some of Clinton's largest donors were from Wall Street. Clinton retaliated by claiming that, as the Senator from New York during the September 11 attacks, she had to work closely with Wall Street since the attacks were so close to Wall Street. Clinton immediately received scrutiny over these comments, including when Dickerson highlighted a Tweet from a viewer reading, \\"Never before have I heard someone use 9/11 to justify millions of Wall Street donations,\\" which drew thunderous applause from the audience, and led to both Sanders and O'Malley also attacking Clinton for those comments. Post-debate criticisms arose from all across the political spectrum, from Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, to Clinton's own former campaign manager, Patti Solis Doyle, who said that the 9/11 reference would've been better used in the previous discussion on terrorism and foreign policy, not justifying her Wall Street connections. The New York Times and many other media organizations have heavily criticized Clinton for invoking 9/11 to cover her Wall Street connections. * Second presidential debate of the Democrats in Des Moines on CBS News Saturday December 19, 2015 – Goffstown, New Hampshire { class=\\" sortable floatright\\" !

It aired on ABC News and was moderated by journalist David Muir, anchor of \\"World News Tonight\\", and Chief Global Affairs Correspondent Martha Raddatz. On December 11, 2015, the DNC had announced that it would revoke the sponsorship of the debate by WMUR-TV because of a labor dispute with its unionized employees. The topics covered during the debate included Sanders' campaign's breach of Clinton's campaign data, strategy for defeating ISIS, gun control, the issue of whether to depose President Assad of Syria, if Wall Street favored each candidate, stability in the Middle East enforced by dictators and whether regime change was necessary, and the role of the First Spouse. * Sunday January 17, 2016 – Charleston, South Carolina { class=\\" sortable floatright\\" !

Held from 9 to 11 pm ET, it was facilitated by Lester Holt and Andrea Mitchell. The location was 7.6 miles southeast of the North Charleston Coliseum, where the last Republican debate had been held on January 14, and the debate aired on NBC News and YouTube. It was also sponsored by the Congressional Black Caucus. It was notable as being the final debate before the start of precinct caucuses and primary voting. On January 8, NBC News announced that in order to qualify for the debate, a candidate must have reached an average of at least 5% either in national polls, or in Iowa, New Hampshire, or South Carolina, based on the five most recent polls recognized by NBC News released before January 14. Both before and after the debate, commentators said the debate was focused on Sanders and his voting record on gun control and slights against President Obama, among other issues. During the debate, O'Malley interrupted to take 30 seconds to talk about \\"homeland security and preparedness\\". Also during the debate, Clinton and Sanders had some back-and-forth exchanges to define themselves on Wall Street, foreign policy, and gun control. Chris Cillizza of The Washington Post viewed Sanders as the winner of the debate, while also praising O'Malley. According to Cillizza, Clinton was, \\"as always, solid,\\" but \\"she did nothing in the debate to slow the momentum that Sanders is building in Iowa and New Hampshire.\\" This was the fourth and final debate appearance of O'Malley, who suspended his campaign on February 1. * Thursday February 4, 2016 – Durham, New Hampshire { class=\\" sortable floatright\\" - !

Polls - Clinton ~ 1 hour 50.4% - Sanders ~ 1 hour 36.3% } The Democratic Party's fifth presidential debate ahead of the 2016 U.S. presidential election was held on February 4, 2016 in Durham, New Hampshire. On January 26, NBC News and the New Hampshire Union Leader announced plans to hold an unsanctioned debate in New Hampshire on February 4, to be moderated by Chuck Todd and Rachel Maddow. Clinton, Sanders, and O'Malley all received an invitation to the debate, with O'Malley being the first to confirm his participation. On January 31, the DNC officially sanctioned the debate but removed the Union Leader as a sponsor, and each major Democratic candidate confirmed their attendance. O'Malley suspended his campaign after a poor showing in the Iowa caucuses, thereby leaving Clinton and Sanders as the remaining participants. The debate aired on February 4, 2016, from 9 to 11 pm ET on MSNBC. Commentators of the debate cited the elevated discourse between the candidates. There was discussion on the death penalty (federal versus state), money in politics, and assessing Russia, Iran, and North Korea as threats to national security. Clinton demanded that Sanders explain his \\"artful smears\\" of Clinton receiving campaign donations. Sanders responded by critiquing the inherently \\"quid-pro-quo\\" nature of Wall Street campaign donations. The exchange between the two candidates was called by Eric Levitz one of the best 10-minute exchanges in the history of American political debates. * Thursday February 11, 2016 – Milwaukee, Wisconsin { class=\\" sortable floatright\\" - !

Starting at 8:00 PM CST, the debate was aired on PBS and simulcast by CNN. Two anchors of PBS NewsHour, Gwen Ifill and Judy Woodruff, moderated for the two candidates. The debate preshow ran for 30 minutes before the debate. Clinton noted it was a new milestone among presidential debates owing to the fact that more women were on the debate stage than men (3:1). After opening statements with Sanders going first, each candidate had 90 seconds to answer and then the other was given a 30-second response. There were two short breaks. During a break, highlights of the debate were shown by Hari Sreenivasan with political commentary from Lisa Desjardins, Amy Walter, and Tamara Keith weighing in on what had been said. The candidates debated on race relations, the size of government, funding their goals, Medicaid/Medicare, campaign contributor's influence, the prospect of a first woman president, affordable college, reducing areas of government, readiness for an attack on America, Henry Kissinger, Russian relations, the U.S. role with respect to refugees, influential leaders on foreign policy, and criticism of President Barack Obama. In closing statements, Sanders talked about bringing people together to create a representative government. Clinton's closing talked about not being a single issue candidate and taking on all barriers to people achieving their individual potentials. After the debate, the commentators were asked if the candidates did what they needed to do. Then Sreenivasan interviewed journalists David Brooks and Mark Shields in the postdebate coverage. * Sunday March 6, 2016 – Flint, Michigan { class=\\" sortable floatright\\" - ! Candidate !

He was joined by CNN's Don Lemon in asking questions. The debate ran for almost two hours. At the end of the debate, Cooper announced a labor union fund had committed $25 million in low-interest loans towards repairing the water system. The Michigan Democratic Party claimed the organization had no tickets to distribute leading up to the debate for the general public, party volunteers & major party donors, however sent out open public emails with links to open invites for any person interested in attending a pre-debate reception and dinner on March 5, combined with debate tickets for March 6, that would be willing to purchase tickets for $1,000 to $20,000 per package via EventBrite. Candidates were given 75 seconds to respond and 30 seconds for follow-ups. Members of the audience, made up of Democrats and Independents, were also given the chance to field questions, which were screened to avoid overlapping in content. Sanders and Clinton were given 60 seconds for opening statements and for closing statements at the end of the debate. A subsequent WikiLeaks email dump suggested that DNC vice chair Donna Brazile gave Clinton an unfair advantage in the debate with Sanders, revealed by Brazille's email message on March 5, 2016, to John Podesta and Jennifer Palmieri with the title: \\"One of the questions directed to HRC tomorrow is from a woman with a rash.\\" The message continued, \\"her family has lead poison and she will ask what, if anything, will Hillary do as president to help the ppl of Flint.\\"\\"CNN drops Donna Brazile as commentator over Wikileaks revelations\\".

After starting at the DNC in April 2015, Manriquez \\"talked about the idea for a debate for Democratic candidates on Univision to anyone who had ears to listen.\\" The debate was officially announced on November 2, 2015. * Thursday April 14, 2016 – Brooklyn, New York The Democratic Party's ninth presidential debate ahead of the 2016 U.S. presidential election was held on April 14, 2016 at the Duggal Greenhouse in Brooklyn Navy Yard. The debate aired on CNN and NY1. Wolf Blitzer of CNN served as moderator. Planned May debate/Potential Sanders/Trump debate Despite previously agreeing to a tenth debate in the state of California, before the last day of primary elections, Hillary Clinton declined to participate. As a result of this, the debate was cancelled. Bernie Sanders called it insulting to the people of California, the largest primary state. After it had been established that a California debate would not take place, Donald Trump offered a debate with Bernie Sanders ahead of the June 7th primary. The only condition for this debate was for the profits to be donated to a charity, which the candidates would agree on. Bernie Sanders accepted the offer; however, Donald Trump eventually declined to participate, stating there was no need to debate a candidate who would not win the Democratic nomination. == Forums == In addition to the main debates, twelve forums were scheduled for the candidates to discuss the issues.

Bernie Sanders of Vermont }  November 6, 2015 – Rock Hill, South Carolina  Rachel Maddow was selected to moderate the First in the South Candidates Forum with Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, and Martin O'Malley, which was held at Winthrop University in Rock Hill, South Carolina, on November 6, co-sponsored by the Democratic Parties of 13 southern states. The forum was not in debate format; instead, each candidate was interviewed individually and sequentially. Lincoln Chafee and Jim Webb were also invited, but their campaigns never responded to the invitations, and both subsequently withdrew from the race. Lessig attempted multiple times to enter the debates but was systematically excluded by the DNC. A Public Policy Poll of South Carolina Democratic voters conducted from November 7–8, after the forum, discovered that 67% of viewers thought Clinton won the forum, 16% thought Sanders won, and 6% thought O'Malley won, with 11% unsure.  November 24, 2015 – MoveOn.org  right The second forum for the Democratic primaries occurred on November 24, 2015. On October 21, 2015, MoveOn announced that it would host a candidate forum to be recorded and aired online in mid-November. The announcement came amid ongoing unrest within the Democratic party over the unusually low number of Democratic debates allowed by the DNC. While five candidates – Lincoln Chafee, Hillary Clinton, Lawrence Lessig, Martin O'Malley, and Bernie Sanders – were invited, only Sanders and O'Malley appeared at the event. Although this was the first forum between the candidates in which Lessig was invited, he dropped out of the race before the forum was to be held. The two candidates delivered responses on Social Security, student debt, gun violence, immigration, campaign finance reform, climate change, the progressive movement, the Syrian refugee crisis, the economy, racial profiling, and police brutality, and gave closing statements.  January 11, 2016 – Des Moines, Iowa  The third forum, the Iowa Brown and Black Forum, occurred on January 11, 2016, at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa.

Chris Hayes interviewed Bernie Sanders at 8:00 pm EDT, and Rachel Maddow interviewed Hillary Clinton at 9:00 pm EDT. ==Criticism and controversy== Number of debates Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley criticized the number of DNC debates, saying that there should have been more debates. The DNC had scheduled six debates, the same number it had scheduled in the previous two contested primaries, 2004 and 2008. Democratic Party candidates are not formally allowed to participate in non-sanctioned debates if they want to participate in the official DNC debates. However, that rule is unenforceable if candidates jointly agree to additional debates or if the sanctioned debates are already over, as was the case in 2016 and in previous years when additional debates were scheduled. Criticism over the number of debates reached a peak at the DNC's national meeting in Minneapolis on August 28. State Senator Martha Fuller Clark, vice chair of the New Hampshire Democratic Party, reportedly had an \\"intense discussion\\" about the number of debates with DNC chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz. During the national meeting, candidate Martin O'Malley criticized DNC officials for the lack of debates. Cecil Benjamin, chair of the Democratic Party of the US Virgin Islands, interrupted the meeting to offer a motion to increase the number of debates; the motion received applause and cheers from the audience. In early September, Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard and former Mayor of Minneapolis R. T. Rybak released a statement calling for more debates and for releasing the restrictions imposed to keep candidates from participating in non-DNC debates. Former DNC chair Howard Dean expressed his disappointment in the rule barring candidates from non-DNC debates, saying \\"It's not right.\\" A small protest took place outside the DNC headquarters in Washington DC on September 16 calling for more debates. On September 18, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi echoed calls for more debates in an interview with the Los Angeles Times. On September 19, 2015, during her speech at the New Hampshire Democratic Party convention, DNC chair Wasserman Schultz was heckled with shouts for more debates. On September 22, the Vermont Democratic Party sent a letter to the DNC calling for more debates.  Black Lives Matter debate  A week after the first debate was held in Las Vegas, the organization Black Lives Matter (which plays a central part in the movement of the same name) launched a petition targeted at the DNC and chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz demanding more debates, and \\"specifically for a #BlackLivesMatter themed Presidential debate.\\" The petition received over 10,000 signatures within 24 hours of being launched, and had over 33,000 signatures as of October 27. The DNC said that it would permit presidential candidates to attend a presidential town hall organized by activists, but that it would not add another debate to its official schedule. In response, the organization released a press statement on its Facebook page stating that \\"[i]n consultation with our chapters, our communities, allies, and supporters, we remain unequivocal that a Presidential Town Hall with support from the DNC does not sufficiently respond to the concerns raised by our members\\", continuing to demand a full additional debate. Candidates invited to debate Harvard professor Lawrence Lessig, who announced his campaign on September 6, criticized the requirement that Democratic candidates must earn at least 1% in three major national polls in the six weeks before the debate. His criticism was centered on the fact that he was excluded from most polls because the Democratic National Committee (DNC) did not officially welcome him to the campaign as it had done for all five other candidates. In the two weeks following his announcement, Lessig was only included in one national poll, in which he met the 1% requirement; other national polls included Vice President Biden, who had yet to announce whether he was running. The day before the CNN debate, the Bloomberg Editorial Board published an editorial entitled, \\"Let All the Candidates Debate, Democrats,\\" calling for the DNC to include Lessig in the debate, but this demand went unheeded. Lessig, upon his withdrawal from the campaign, was quoted as saying that \\"from the start it was clear that getting into the Democratic debates was the essential step in this campaign. I may be known in tiny corners of the tubes of the internets, but I am not well-known to the American public generally.\\" Lessig acknowledged that in order to raise the discussion of campaign finance reform in the 2016 election, getting into debates was key. \\"But last week, we learned that the Democratic party has changed its rules for inclusion in the debate,\\" he said. The DNC debate-qualifying rule originally required a candidate to poll at least 1% in three national polls during the six weeks prior to a debate. Under the new rule, which Lessig stated was the reason for his campaign suspension, a candidate is required to poll at least 1% in three national polls at least six weeks before a debate. Lessig said that \\"unless we can time travel, there is no way that I can qualify.\\" He then announced the suspension of his campaign.  Dates with low expected ratings  The campaigns of both Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley have criticized the days and times for the debates as well as stating that more debates are needed. Of the nine debates, two took place on a Saturday, two on Sunday, three on a Thursday, one on a Tuesday and one on a Wednesday. The choice of Saturday was criticised because it generally has lower television viewership according to Nielsen ratings, with only Friday nights having lower ratings. While the first Democratic debate took place on a Tuesday night and drew 15.3 million viewers, the second Democratic debate took place on a Saturday night and drew only about 8.5 million viewers. The third Democratic debate also took place on a Saturday night, and drew slightly lower but comparable ratings to the second debate. In the event, the Saturday night debates were the third- and fifth-most watched debates. One of the Saturday night debates took place the Saturday before Christmas, and another took place on Sunday night of Martin Luther King Day weekend, a scheduling that Vox.com says is also expected to make for poor ratings. Democratic National Committee (DNC) chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz has denied claims that the DNC wants to protect frontrunner Hillary Clinton by picking dates that will receive poor viewership. ==See also== * Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2016 * Democratic Party presidential candidates, 2016 * Green Party presidential debates and forums, 2016 * Libertarian Party presidential debates and forums, 2016 * Republican Party presidential debates and forums, 2016 * United States presidential election debates, 2016 ==References * Video of the November 6, 2015 forum in Rock Hill, South Carolina * Video of MoveOn's November 24, 2015 virtual forum * Video of the January 11, 2016 forum in Des Moines, State of Iowa * Video of the February 18, 2016 forum in Las Vegas, State of Nevada * Video of the April 14, 2016 debate in Brooklyn, New York * Video of the February 23, 2016 forum in Columbia, South Carolina ** Sanders Pt1 ** Sanders Pt2 ** H.Clinton Pt1 ** H.Clinton Pt2 Category:2016 United States presidential debates 2016 ","title":"2016 Democratic Party presidential debates and forums"},{"id":"46385541","text":"Kevin Dillon (23 December 1924 – 7 October 1984) was a former Australian rules footballer who played with Richmond in the Victorian Football League (VFL). == Notes  External links == * * Category:1924 births Category:1984 deaths Category:Australian rules footballers from Victoria (Australia) Category:Richmond Football Club players Category:University Blacks Football Club players Category:Kew Football Club players ","title":"Kevin Dillon (Australian footballer)"},{"id":"46385553","text":"Garra festai is a species of ray-finned fish in the family Cyprinidae.

It is distinguished by its bright yellow flower heads but its distribution is restricted to one national park. ==Description== Melaleuca oldfieldii is a spreading shrub which grows to about high but sometimes much taller. Its leaves are arranged alternately on the stems, have a short stalk, are oval to elliptic in shape tapering to a point, usually long, wide and with 5 longitudinal veins. The flowers are bright yellow and arranged in relatively large heads on the ends of branches which continue to grow after flowering. The heads are up to in diameter and contain 4 to 9 groups of flowers in threes. The petals are long and fall off as the flower opens. The stamens are arranged in five bundles around the flower, each bundle containing 8 to 12 stamens. Flowering occurs mainly in November and is followed by fruit which are woody capsules long in tight, roughly spherical groups about in diameter. ==Taxonomy and naming== Melaleuca oldfieldii was first described in 1867 by George Bentham in \\"Flora Australiensis\\". The specific epithet (oldfieldii) is in recognition of the collector Augustus Oldfield who collected this species near the Murchison River. ==Distribution and habitat== Melaleuca oldfieldii occurs in the Kalbarri National Park in the Geraldton Sandplains biogeographic region, growing in sand or sandy clay, usually along streams. ==Conservation== This species is classified as \\"Priority Two\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife meaning that is poorly known and from one or a few locations. ==Uses== Horticulture This species has proven difficult to maintain in cultivation except in special conditions but its glossy leaves and attractive yellow flowers indicate its potential as an ornamental. It requires excellent drainage.

He married Vida Grenfell in 1914. ==Football== Richmond (VFL) Recruited from the Castlemaine Foundry Football Club,District Senior Team, The Mount Alexander Mail, (Wednesday, 16 June 1909), p.1. he played his first match for Richmond, against St Kilda, at the Punt Road Oval, on 31 July 1909. ::Les Oliver, who has bounced into prominence as one of the most brilliant players of the season, was born in Brunswick 23 years ago. He is one of the sturdiest players in the game, standing 5 feet 11 inches in his stockings, and tipping the scales at 12[stone]-2[pounds]. Before he had reached his teens his family had removed to Castlemaine and it was in the foundry team of Thomson and Co., where he was employed, that Oliver had his first games. Four years ago, he came to Richmond, but after a season he returned home and subsequently put in a year with South Bendigo. Last year he returned to the Richmond team, and his dashing performances since are fresh in the memory. He is easily, the fastest man playing in Melbourne football to-day. After winning big sprint handicaps at Bendigo and Maryborough this season, he was made a warm favorite for the Stawell Gift—the Grand Prix of Australian pedestrianism. He did not leave the holes as smartly as usual, and was beaten into third place in the final. If the race were run again Oliver would probably again start favorite and win. His three brothers were also very speedy. George Oliver, the eldest (Les. is the youngest of the four) was second in a Stawell Gift some years ago and Norman Oliver, who will be remembered as a star wing man: for Collingwood, was successful in a Shepparton Gift and other big events. Norman has given football up. Jim Oliver won a few events at the running grounds at Flemington. He is proprietor of a flourishing tailoring establishment—the American Suitery—and has the reputation of being one of the best cutters in Melbourne. He is now training with Richmond and shows considerable promise. The selection of Les Oliver for the Victorian team to meet South Australia next Saturday is a well-deserved tribute to his prowess as a player, and he will uphold the credit of the club and his State on and off the field.

In this episode, a young Cruella de Vil is tortured by her mother's evil use of her Dalmatians, resulting in her eventual confinement to her attic until a strange visitor tells her she should stand up to her mother. In Storybrooke, Regina's plan to save Robin are put on hold when Henry is taken by Cruella, teaming her up with Emma Swan to save their son. ==Plot== Opening Sequence Dalmatian puppies run through the forest. Event chronology * The 1920s England events takes place a few years after Isaac became the Author in \\"Operation Mongoose\\". * The Storybrooke events takes place after \\"Heart of Gold\\". In the Characters' Past In 1920s England, a young Cruella De Vil is being mistreated by her mother Madeline as she instructs her Dalmatians to chase her daughter, and is locked in the attic in the same setting that resembles the novel Flowers in the Attic. Fast forward to several years later, and that a reporter, who is revealed to be the Author but is using an alias by the name of Isaac, is paying a visit to the home pretending to seek out a story after having seen Cruella from the attic, only to have Madeline warning him to stay away. Isaac returns and helps Cruella escape from the attic. He then takes Cruella out for a date that includes dinner and dancing. Cruella reveals to Isaac that the reason she was kept in the attic was that she witnessed her mother kill her father and her succeeding husbands; Isaac then reveals to Cruella that he was more than just a reporter and has the ability to use his pen and ink to create magical stories. Isaac proposes that they run away together, and uses his quill and ink to give Cruella her persuasion powers to control animals. However, for Isaac, his future with Cruella would later take a unique twist that will put his future in danger. When Madeline pays a visit to see him, she tells him that Cruella had lied to him about what actually happened to her husbands: Cruella was a disturbed child psychopath who killed them, not Madeline, who was trying to prevent her from killing others by locking her away. When Madeline returns home, Cruella was ready for her, and eventually kills her mother by controlling her Dalmatians and commanding them to attack her. Afterwards, Isaac realized his quill was missing, so he pays a visit to see Cruella and is stunned that she used him as a means to an end, and Cruella used the skin from her mother's dogs as fur for her signature coat. The confrontation lead the two to fight over the ink, which is then spilled on Cruella, transforming her into the infamous black & white infused-hair character. As Cruella is about to kill him, Issac uses his powers as the Author to make it so that Cruella can never kill anyone ever again by writing it down on a piece of paper. As he leaves, Cruella tells him she's not done. In Storybrooke As Cruella races off into the forest, she is stopped in her tracks by Maleficent, who now knows that she was the one who knew where Lily went after they were sucked into the portal back in the Enchanted Forest. As Maleficent transforms into a dragon, Cruella uses her breath to exhale green smoke and puts her frenemy to sleep, then comes up with a plan to go after the Author. Meanwhile, Emma Swan is still arguing with Mary Margaret and David when Regina informs them about Zelena, prompting her to see Belle, who in turn interrupts Gold's plan to make the Author write stories, which in turn prompts Gold to come to the well to see her, and he reveals that his heart is darkening and he will die, only to discover that Belle is being controlled by Regina, who is using Belle's heart to make sure that Gold does not contact Zelena as Regina schemes to go to New York to confront her half-sister. Cruella then pays a visit to Isaac to make up for lost time and to offer him a deal, as Gold does not know that they knew each other as Isaac catches on to her deception. And since Isaac knows that Cruella has no power to kill anyone, Cruella, who tells Isaac that there are other ways to \\"skin a author,\\" finds a way to make it happen by kidnapping Henry by using a controlled Pongo, which she uses to force both Emma and Regina to do her bidding by making the mothers kill Isaac or else Cruella will kill Henry. As Gold returns to the cabin, he tells Isaac that he knew about his past with Cruella and informs Isaac about the kidnapping, which Gold knows will lead to Emma's darkness. Isaac then hands Gold a note he kept from the club. At the apartment, Emma, Regina, Hook, Mary Margaret and David discuss their plan of action but even this has Emma concerned. Regina, Emma and Hook search the woods just in time for Henry to escape from Cruella (while she is playing Angry Birds), but as the three split up and only Regina and Hook are tricked by seashells planted by Gold, its Emma who finds Henry, but Cruella is threatening to throw Henry off of the cliff, then tempts Emma's patience to see if she will do it, reminding her that heroes never kill. At the same time Mary Margaret and David confront Isaac, who reveals that a chapter in Emma's future will involve her turning dark and they race to stop her upon reading the note that revealed that Cruella is incapable of killing anyone. They arrive just in time to see Emma use her powers and kill Cruella by knocking her off the cliff. As a terrified Henry cries in his mother's arms, Emma's face has changed to a sinister look, implying that her heart is going dark. ==Cultural references== *The episode's title is a reference to the Rolling Stones song \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\". *This episode is a rendition of The Hundred and One Dalmatians, with Cruella De Vil and Pongo. *The song that Cruella hears on the radio is a jazz instrumental version of \\"Cruella de Vil\\", from the 1961 Disney animated movie One Hundred and One Dalmatians. *Madeline's car is similar in design and color to Cruella's car in 1961 Disney animated movie One Hundred and One Dalmatians. ==Reception== Ratings The episode held steady from the previous episode, as it posted a 1.6/5 among 18-49s with 5.12 million viewers tuning in, retaining its lead among scripted programs in the 8 p.m. timeslot despite coming in second behind the Academy of Country Music Awards on CBS during that hour.\\"TV Ratings Sunday: 'A.D.: The Bible Continues' Collapses, 'Revenge' Rises + 'American Country Awards' Up From Last Year\\" from TV By The Numbers/Zap2It (April 21, 2015) Reviews The episode was met with positive reviews. Hilary Busis of Entertainment Weekly noted \\"The thing about a show that specializes in twisted fairy tales is that sooner or later, those watching it will learn to expect the twists. Which meant that, halfway through tonight's episode, it was only natural to grow suspicious. The backstory we'd been given so far about Cruella de Vil—that once upon a time, she was an innocent, wide-eyed blonde completely at the mercy of her wicked, ultra-controlling mother—just seemed a little, well, familiar. Give or take a flapper dress and a pair of Dalmatians, her past looked remarkably like Regina's and Ursula's, for that matter. (Once does love its daddy/mommy issue stories, doesn't it?) Which meant that one of two things was happening: Either the show was really repeating itself almost to the letter, or things were about to take a right turn into Crazy Town (Not that one). Thankfully for everything, Once went with Option 2.\\"\\"Once Upon a Time recap: 'Sympathy for the De Vil'\\" from Entertainment Weekly (April 19, 2015) Amy Ratcliffe of IGN said of the episode, \\"Overall, this week's Once Upon a Time made Cruella a stronger villain by giving her a twisted backstory. This is someone who doesn't have a softer side, and it's a nice change. She's unapologetic and cruel. Though there were clunky aspects in the episode, they expanded the mythology of the world and the Author's role as well as adding another layer to Rumplestiltskin's motivations.\\" Ratcliffe gave the episode a 7.3 rating out of 10. In a review from Rickey.org, Nick Roman cites \\"I was probably too quick to judge last week's Once Upon a Time. One of the things that occasionally bugs me about the narrative for this season, and which \\"Sympathy for the De Vil\\" happily corrects, is this idea that every villain has a kernel of goodness in them. Cruella de Vil (Victoria Smurfit) is bad all the way through, and the show is better for it.\\"\\"‘Once Upon A Time’ Review: Sympathy for the De Vil Offers Fascinating Look At True Villainy'\\" from Rickey.org (April 19, 2015) ==ReferencesCategory:2015 American television episodes Category:Once Upon a Time (season 4) episodes ","title":"Sympathy for the De Vil"},{"id":"46385752","text":"Jim O'Brien (2 August 1936 – 23 January 1996) was a former Australian rules footballer who played with St Kilda in the Victorian Football League (VFL). == Notes  External links == * * Category:1936 births Category:1996 deaths Category:Australian rules footballers from Victoria (Australia) Category:St Kilda Football Club players Category:Old Xaverians Football Club players ","title":"Jim O'Brien (Australian footballer)"},{"id":"46385761","text":"Bill Stephenson (14 February 1937 – 10 August 2010) was a former Australian rules footballer who played with St Kilda in the Victorian Football League (VFL).

He represented Bay de Verde in the Newfoundland House of Assembly from 1923 to 1928. The son of John Cramm and Margaret King, he was born in Small Point and was educated in nearby Salem, at the Tilton Seminary in New Hampshire and at the Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut. Cramm studied law and was admitted to practice as a solicitor in 1923. He was called to the Newfoundland bar in 1924 and was named King's Counsel in 1928. In 1924, he married Ollie Lynette Moores. Cramm was elected to the Newfoundland assembly in 1923 as a Liberal. After Richard Squires stepped down as leader, Cramm supported William Warren. However, after the Hollis Walker Report was released which recommended criminal charges against Squires, he joined the opposition and moved the motion of no confidence which brought down Warren's administration. He was reelected in 1924 as a Liberal-Conservative. He was named a minister without portfolio in the new cabinet and, in 1926, became acting Attorney General. Cramm was defeated in 1928 when he ran as an independent candidate in Carbonear. He returned to practising law in St. John's. In May and June 1932, he served as a minister without portfolio in the short-lived Squires cabinet. In 1949, he ran unsuccessfully as a Progressive Conservative candidate in the Canadian federal riding of Trinity—Conception.

The southern foothills of the James Range and the permanent spring from which the reserve takes its name are found within the reserve. ==History== The area is significant to the Western Arrente peoples and is part of the Kunnea Snake Dreamtime. The Arrente have occupied the region for thousands of years with artefacts such as grindstones being found in and around the reserve. The first European to visit was Ernest Giles who explored the area in 1874, the first settlers and cattle stations were established nearly a decade later. The site includes the ruins of the Illamurta Springs Police Station which was established in 1893 and operated until 1912. The police station was built to combat Aboriginal resistance against pastoralists in the area, mostly by spearing cattle. Once spearing stock stopped the police station was used as an administration centre for the distribution of rations to Aboriginal people. Mounted Constable Ernest Cowle led the younger members of the Horn Expedition across the Lake Amadeus saltpan to Uluru and then return across the McDonnell Ranges in 1894. He became friends with Walter Baldwin Spencer at this time, and later, when serving at Illumurta Springs, collaborated with Spencer and Frank Gillen on their famous work The Native Tribes of Central Australia (1899). This work was later described by John Mulvaney, considered the \\"father of Australian archaeology\\", as one of Australia's most influential books in the history of ideas\\", and he gave much credit to Cowle and also Paddy Byrne, telegraphist at Charlotte Waters.

Both were co- written by Sidney Howard and Paul de Kruif (the former a Pulitzer- and Oscar- winning playwright and screenwriter; the latter a well-known microbiologist and author). The play is the work of Sidney Howard and is based on a chapter in Paul de Kruif's 1927 book Microbe Hunters. James Stewart in his first dramatic role stars as Pvt. John O'Hara, a role reprised by Robert Montgomery in the 1938 film. Stewart later stated this role convinced him to continue his acting career during a time he recalled that \\"From 1932 through 1934...I'd only worked three months. Every play I got into folded.\\"Eliot, Mark. Jimmy Stewart: A Biography. New York: Random House, 2006. (pg. 58). The experience led him to stay with acting and he first entered movies later that year in The Murder Man. Caricaturist Al Hirschfeld while covering the play for the New York Herald Tribune drew his first of 13 drawings (and only one from a play) he made over the course of Stewart's career. The play opened at the opulent Martin Beck Theatre on March 6, 1934, and ran for 79 performances. The Martin Beck was renamed in 2003 for Al Hirschfeld, who drew the caricature for Yellow Jack. Prior to its debut, Herman Bernstein's Jewish Daily Bulletin covered the play, approving that it did not contain anti-semitic elements. ==Synopsis== After the Spanish–American War, in which more U. S. soldiers were killed by yellow fever (known as Yellow Jack) than in battle, the War Department sent a medical commission to Cuba to find, if possible, the cause and cure of this deadly tropical disease. The commission was headed by Dr. Walter Reed. With him was Dr. James Carroll. In Cuba they found Dr. Jesse Lazear, European- trained microbiologist, and Cuban Dr. Aristides Agramonte. Limited in its experiments by the fact that animals are immune to Yellow Jack and embroiled in government interference, Reed decides that the only way to test the theory is to expose his own men to the disease. O'Hara volunteers to allow Dr. Reed to experiment on him. Left to right: Sam Levene, James Stewart, Edward Acuff, Katherine Wilson and Myron McCormick in the original 1934 Broadway production of Yellow Jack. ==Reception== Debuting on March 6, 1934, the Broadway production ran through May for a modest 79 performances.

Built in 1972, it is the fourth building dedicated to house court functions and county administration. ==History== In the early years of Buena Vista County there was no courthouse. After it was established in 1851 and until 1856 it relied on Woodbury County for voting and judicial functions. Prairieville was named the county seat, but it never developed. Court sessions after the county was organized in 1858 were held in private homes and storerooms. The first courthouse was built in Sioux Rapids in 1870. The two-story structure was completed for $4,945. Just after the courthouse was completed, Alta, Newell, and Storm Lake started to vie for the county seat. The railroad had just begun serving the communities and they were starting to expand. Newell even had a brick building constructed for a courthouse. The courthouse in Sioux Rapids was destroyed in a fire on January 1, 1877. A safe and the records of the county board of supervisors was all that survived. Court sessions were moved to a schoolhouse. Storm Lake offered the use of its recently completed city hall for use as a courthouse for ten years if the county agreed to make it the county seat. The offer was accepted in 1878 and local residents went to Sioux Rapids to retrieve the county records. A 2½-story, brick, Vernacular Romanesque courthouse was built in 1888 for $25,000. Sac County used it as a model for their courthouse a year later. The current Buena Vista County Courthouse was begun in 1969 and it was dedicated in May 1972. The Modern movement building was completed at a cost of $1.2 million. The structure is in the shape of an \\"L\\" with two wings that mirror each other. It features a courtroom in the round that measures in diameter. ==References== Category:Government buildings completed in 1972 Category:Modernist architecture in Iowa Category:County courthouses in Iowa Category:Buildings and structures in Buena Vista County, Iowa Category:Storm Lake, Iowa ","title":"Buena Vista County Courthouse (Iowa)"},{"id":"46385906","text":"Richard L.

Jean Jannon (died 20 December 1658) was a French printer, type designer, punchcutter and typefounder active in Sedan in the seventeenth century. A Protestant, after working in Paris Jannon established a career as printer for the Protestant Academy of Sedan in what is now north-eastern France. He was a reasonably prolific printer by contemporary standards, printing several hundred books. Sedan at the time enjoyed an unstable independence as a principality at a time when the French government had conceded through the Edict of Nantes to allowing a complicated system of restricted liberties for Protestants. He also established a second career as a punchcutter, in his thirties by his report. In 1640 he left Sedan and returned to Paris. Despite his religious views, the royal printing office of France bought matrices, moulds used to cast metal type, from him in 1641 for three large size of type. These matrices survive and remain in the government collection. He was otherwise particularly respected for his engraving of an extremely small size of type, known as Sédanoise, which was popular. In 1640, Jannon left Sedan for Paris to take over the press of his son, who had recently died. Four years later, his printing office in Caen was raided by authorities concerned that he may have been publishing banned material. While not imprisoned, Jannon ultimately returned to Sedan and spent the rest of his life there. Following his death, the printing-office at Sedan continued in operation; his family gave up his type foundry in 1664. It was reported to been taken over by Langlois in Paris, although Abraham van Dijck in the 1670s said he intended to buy matrices from Sedan so (if his information was not out of date) some materials might have remained there. ==Career== Jannon began his career as a printer, first attested in Paris, where he apparently worked for the Estienne family in his early career, and then in Sedan. He mentions in one preface of hearing of the early history of printing in Mainz, so possibly he served an apprenticeship in Germany. Jannon may have left Paris due to lack of work there or personal conflicts: his friend at the time, diarist Pierre de L'Estoile recorded in his diary that he met with disapproval with Huguenot authorities for taking on the job of printing a piece of Catholic propaganda. According to d'Estoile the response of formal approbation from local Huguenot authorities \\"upset him badly\\", and he commented that they would be worse than Jesuits if given the chance. Jannon married first Anne de Quingé, who died in 1618. Two years later he married Marie Demangin, who had had left her husband. A report from the Council of the Reformed Church of Mainz confirming that the remarriage was acceptable described as her former husband's conduct as a proven series of \\"adulteries, polygamies and debaucheries\\". Jannon engraved decorative material, signed with an II monogram. He and took up engraving metal type- quite late in life by the standards of the period, in his thirties by his report. Jannon wrote in his 1621 specimen that: > Seeing that for some time many persons have had to do with the art [of > printing] who have greatly lowered it…the desire came upon me to try if I > might imitate, after some fashion, some one among those who honourably > busied themselves with the art, [men whose deaths] I hear regretted every > day [Jannon mentions some eminent printers of the previous century]…and > inasmuch as I could not accomplish this design for lack of types which I > needed…[some typefounders] would not, and others could not furnish me with > what I lacked [so] I resolved, about six years ago, to turn my hand in good > earnest to the making of punches, matrices and moulds for all sorts of > characters, for the accommodation both of the public and of myself. Jannon was one of the few punchcutters active in early seventeenth century France. This is perhaps owing to an economic decline over the previous century and due to pre-existing typefaces made during the mid-sixteenth century saturating the market. Jannon's typefaces are based on the style of the previous century, especially the roman. Some differences in the roman are his characteristic 'a' with a curved bowl and the top left serifs of letters such as 'm' and 'p', with a distinctive scooped-out form. His italics are more distinctive and eccentric, being steeply slanted and with very obviously variable angle of slant on the capitals. Opinions on the aesthetic quality of his type has varied: Warde thought it \\"so technically brilliant as to be decadent...of slight value as a book face\\", H. D. L. Vervliet described it as \\"famous not so much for the quality of the design but as for the long-term confusion it created\\" and Hugh Williamson considered his type to lack the \\"perfection of clarity and grace\\" of the sixteenth century, although many reproductions of his work were certainly popular in printing in the twentieth century. Garamond misattribution An excerpt from Jannon's specimen of 1621. Despite a distinguished career as a printer, Jannon is perhaps most famous for a long-lasting historical misattribution. In 1641, the Imprimerie royale, or royal printing office, purchased matrices, the moulds used to cast metal type, from him. By the mid-nineteenth century, Jannon's matrices formed the only substantial collection of printing materials in the Latin alphabet left in Paris from before the eighteenth century. The matrices came to be attributed to Claude Garamond (d. 1561), a revered punchcutter of the sixteenth century who was known to have made punches for the government in the Greek alphabet, albeit a century before the Imprimerie was established. The attribution came to be considered certain by the Imprimerie's director Arthur Christian. Doubt began to be raised by historian Jean Paillard in 1914, but he died in the First World War soon after publishing his conclusions and his work remained little-read. Several early revivals of Jannon's type were made under the name of 'Garamond'. 'Garamond' fonts actually based on Jannon's work include American Type Founders' Garamond, later reissued by Linotype as Garamond No. 3, Monotype Garamond, the version included with Microsoft Office, and Frederic Goudy's Garamont (following the most common spelling of Garamond's name in his lifetime). The mistake was finally disproved in 1926 by Beatrice Warde (writing under the pseudonym of \\"Paul Beaujon\\"), based on the work of Paillard and her discovery of material printed by Jannon himself in London and Paris libraries. A former librarian at American Type Founders, she had been privately told by the company's archivist Henry Lewis Bullen (perhaps aware of Paillard's work) that he doubted his company's \\"Garamond\\" was really from the sixteenth century, noting that he could not find it used in a book from the period. František Štorm's 2010 revival, Jannon Pro, is one of the few modern revivals of Jannon's work released under his name. Caractères de l'Université Jannon's type from an Imprimerie nationale specimen. The 'J' is a later addition. By the nineteenth century, Jannon's matrices had come to be known as the Caractères de l'Université (Characters of the University). The origin of this name is uncertain. It has sometimes been claimed that this term was an official name designated for the Jannon type by Cardinal Richelieu, while Warde in 1926 more plausibly suggested it might be a garbled recollection of Jannon's work with the Sedan Academy, which operated much like a university despite not using the name. Carter in the 1970s followed this conclusion. Mosley, however, concludes that no report of the term (or much use of Jannon's type at all) exists before the nineteenth century, and it may originate from a generic term of the previous century simply meaning older or more conservative typeface designs, perhaps those preferred in academic publishing. Jannon's specimen survives in a single copy at the Bibliothèque Mazarine in Paris. Warde, again under the pseudonym of Beaujon, published a facsimile reprint in 1927. ==NotesReferences== Category:1658 deaths Category:French typographers Category:French designers ","title":"Jean Jannon"},{"id":"46385913","text":"The Butler County Courthouse is located at 428 Sixth Street in Allison, Iowa, United States. It opened in 1975 and replaced a structure originally measuring completed in 1881 when the county seat relocated from Clarksville to Allison. The 1881 courthouse was enlarged in 1903 and again in 1937. Beginning in the 1950s, county officials realized the need for a new building and requested funding through ballot proposals in 1956, 1957, and 1970. Voters rejected these proposals forcing officials to cancel court hearings and other functions due to insufficient heat and overloaded electrical wiring and rent space in other buildings. Their fourth request for funding in 1973 was successful and officials received 13 bids to construct a new courthouse. They selected the Marshalltown, Iowa firm of Cervetti-Weber & Associates, Inc. at a cost of $48,878.84. The new courthouse would be constructed on the grassy area immediately south of the 1881 building. Groundbreaking was April 14, 1974, and officials dedicated the new facility December 14, 1975. The building was completed for about $940,000. The new building is faced with brown brick and houses all county offices except for the sheriff, who maintains offices in the adjacent jail.

The present courthouse is the third structure the county has used for court functions and county administration. ==History== Rochester was Cedar County's first county seat. The log building built there as a courthouse and jail may never have been used for court purposes. It was used, however, for school exhibitions, dances, and maybe as a jail. The county seat was moved to Tipton in 1841, but the frame courthouse building was not completed until 1845. It had been built on a square that had been set aside for a courthouse when the town was surveyed. The delay in construction may be attributed to the unusual funding scheme whereby the jail was funded first by the sale of town lots, and when that was paid, they would pay for the courthouse. The unfinished building was occupied by the county. After it was finished it had so much extra space that the second floor was rented to the local Masonic lodge. It was replaced in 1859 with a brick courthouse that featured a tall cupola capped with a dome. It was extensively renovated and enlarged in 1889. The cupola was removed at that time, and a clock tower was added above the main entrance. The tower proved unsafe and it had to be removed in 1948. The present Modern-style brick courthouse was begun in 1965 and completed three years later for about $595,000. ==References== Category:Government buildings completed in 1968 Category:Modernist architecture in Iowa Category:County courthouses in Iowa Category:Buildings and structures in Cedar County, Iowa Category:Tipton, Iowa ","title":"Cedar County Courthouse (Iowa)"},{"id":"46385944","text":"Matej Zatlkaj is a Slovak Magic: The Gathering player and commentator.

The courthouse is the fourth structure to house court functions and county administration. ==History== When Cerro Gordo County was created in 1855 Mason City was selected to be the county seat. Dissatisfaction in the western part of the county led the Iowa General Assembly to appoint three new commissioners who would move the county seat to a site they called Livonia, which was near Clear Lake. A courthouse was built there, and some of the county records were moved in the winter of 1857. County officials reluctantly followed. A petition signed by over half of the citizens of the county requested that the county seat be moved back to Mason City, and it was the first business before the court. Mason City won a referendum in 1858 to decide the matter 155-48. There is nothing left in what was Livonia to remind people of its brief existence. Two courthouses have stood in Mason City prior to the present Modernist structure that was occupied by the county in 1960. The first was located across the street from Central Park. The courtroom was on the second floor, while the first floor housed various county offices. By 1880 the county had outgrown the building and plans were made to construct a new one. Referendums to build it were defeated in 1880, 1881, and 1882. Concerns were raised over the security of county records as the building became dilapidated. Construction for the large Bedford stone courthouse would not begin until 1899. The two-story Romanesque Revival-style structure was built over a raised basement. It featured a central clock tower and was completed for $64,000. The security of county records again became an issue by the late 1950s. A new courthouse was expected to cost $1.5 million. The county decided to save money and acquired the Standard Oil Building in 1959 for $159,400. They remodeled it for their use, and added an addition using the remainder of the $750,000 bond issue. ==References== Category:Modernist architecture in Iowa Category:County courthouses in Iowa Category:Buildings and structures in Mason City, Iowa ","title":"Cerro Gordo County Courthouse (Iowa)"},{"id":"46385967","text":"Marcos Vinícius de Jesus Araújo (born 24 December 1994), known as Marcos Vinícius, is a Brazilian footballer who plays as an attacking midfielder. ==Club career== Marcos Vinícius was born in Marabá, Pará, and after short spells at Corinthians and Bahia, joined Náutico in 2010, aged 15.Santo de casa: solução para a camisa 10 do Cruzeiro pode estar na Toca II (Home saint: solution for Cruzeiro's '10' could be in Toca II); Globo Esporte, 27 March 2015 He subsequently graduated with the latter and made his professional debut on 14 September 2011, coming on as a second-half substitute for Lenon in a 1–2 away loss against Bragantino for the Série B championship.Ficha Técnica: Bragantino 2 x 1 Náutico (Match report: Bragantino 2–1 Náutico); Gazeta Esportiva, 13 September 2011 Marcos Vinícius made his Série A debut on 29 May 2013, again from the bench in a 0–3 home loss against Vitória.Vitória arrasa o Náutico nos Aflitos com dois gols do primo de Messi (Vitória crushes Náutico at Aflitos with two goals from Messi's cousin); Globo Esporte, 29 May 2013 He scored his first goal in the category on 2 June, netting a last-minute equalizer in a 2–2 home draw against Portuguesa.Gol no fim evita derrota do Náutico para a Lusa no adeus dos Aflitos (Goal in the end avoids Náutico's defeat to Lusa in Aflitos' farewell); Globo Esporte, 2 June 2013 On 10 November 2014 Marcos Vinícius was loaned to Cruzeiro until December 2015, with a buyout clause.Cruzeiro confirma acerto com Marcos Vinícius, revelação do Náutico (Cruzeiro confirms deal with Marcos Vinícius, Náutico's newcomer); O Tempo, 10 November 2014 On 4 April of the following year, after only appearing with the side in Campeonato Mineiro, Raposa bought 50% of his rights.Cruzeiro compra de 50% dos direitos econômicos do meia Marcos Vinícius (Cruzeiro buys 50% of midfielder Marcos Vinícius' federative rights); Globo Esporte, 4 April 2015 ==Honours== Club ;Botafogo * Campeonato Carioca: 2018 ==ReferencesCategory:1994 births Category:Living people Category:People from Pará Category:Brazilian footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:Campeonato Brasileiro Série A players Category:Campeonato Brasileiro Série B players Category:Clube Náutico Capibaribe players Category:Cruzeiro Esporte Clube players Category:Botafogo de Futebol e Regatas players Category:Associação Chapecoense de Futebol players ","title":"Marcos Vinícius de Jesus Araújo"},{"id":"46385969","text":"The 2015 Virginia Cavaliers men's soccer team will be the college's 75th season of playing organized men's college soccer, and their 62nd season playing in the Atlantic Coast Conference.

Native Americans attacked settlers along the Des Moines River in 1862. There were between 25 and 40 families who took up shelter in the unfinished building for protection. A company of Union Army soldiers from Sioux City, Iowa took up quarters in the building, and the settlers returned to their homes. The troops remained until 1865, and work was done to the building sporadically until the brick Greek Revival structure was completed in 1868. In addition to a courthouse, this building was used for a schoolhouse, revival meetings, dances, traveling shows, political meetings, and other civic functions. It and some of the county records were destroyed in a fire on November 24, 1871. The second county courthouse was a brick structure that was built using some of the bricks from the original courthouse. The building was condemned in the late 1880s. The third courthouse was begun in October 1890 and it opened in 1891 at a cost of almost $15,000. T.D. Allen designed the structure in a Romanesque Revival style featuring a square tower with a hip roof on one corner. Bricks from the first two courthouses were mixed in with the concrete that was used for the foundation. It was expanded in 1957, 1976, and 1978 to accommodate the growing county government. The third county courthouse was listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1981. By the early 21st-century, the historic structure started to fail and the County Board of Supervisors determined it was not worth renovating. Voters authorized spending for the current facility in 2003 after three failed attempts. RDG Planning and Design of Des Moines was hired to design the new courthouse. Construction on the present courthouse was begun in July 2004 by McHan Construction of Sioux City. Former U.S. Congressman Berkley Bedell gave the keynote address at the groundbreaking ceremony on August 12. The old courthouse remained in use during the first phase of construction until it was razed in 2005. It was removed from the NRHP the following year. Phase one construction, the western half of the building, was completed in March 2006 and the county jail, communications center and sheriff's department, assessor, recorder, treasurer, veterans affairs, clerk of courts, and community services moved into the new facility during an snowstorm. The courtrooms and law library were also finished at this time. Phase II of the $14.9 million project was completed in January 2009, and the remaining county offices moved into the building. It was the first time in 50 years that all county offices were in the same building. The courthouse was the first new county courthouse built in Iowa in more than 30 years. It was dedicated in June 2009. ==Architecture== The facility is two stories, faced with red brick and limestone accents, and features large windows on its curved front façade. Adjacent is a tower at the same location of the tower of the former courthouse and visually similar. It rises and houses information on county history, attractions, and veterans named on the nearby memorial. Designed to last at least 100 years, the courthouse features three courtrooms, a state-of-the-art jail system and 911 communications center, a community/supervisors room that seats more than 100 people, decorative medallions on the terrazzo floor that depict county townships and lakes, and an eco-friendly parking lot that uses low impact development techniques to manage stormwater runoff. ==References== Category:Government buildings completed in 2009 Category:Modernist architecture in Iowa Category:County courthouses in Iowa Category:Buildings and structures in Dickinson County, Iowa Category:Former National Register of Historic Places in Iowa ","title":"Dickinson County Courthouse (Iowa)"},{"id":"46385994","text":"The Emmet County Courthouse is located in Estherville, Iowa, United States. It is the third building to house court functions and county administration. ==History== Emmet County was created in 1851, but because it lacked settlers, no county government was established until 1858 and a vote was taken on February 7, 1859. A group of three commissioners chose Estherville to be the county seat. A Fort Dodge, Iowa contractor received a contract to build a schoolhouse and a courthouse in 1859. The schoolhouse was completed and the construction on the courthouse was under when the county realized it could not pay the contractor with the land it promised because the surveyor general would not accept the surveys done in Emmet County and release the land. The contractor established land agencies in the eastern United States that issued worthless land deeds. When the landowners arrived in the county they found out they had to homestead the land in order to receive the land from the government. The completed school building was moved to a different location and it was used as the courthouse until 1876 when it was destroyed by fire. On October 20, 1879, the county seat was moved to Swan Lake in the center of the county, but because of litigation over the move, a courthouse was never built there. There was also little in the way of settlement in this part of the county. Before the issue could be resolved in the courts, the county seat was moved back to Estherville after a vote in 1882. In 1884 a two-story, brick, Italiante courthouse was built for $11,718. It featured bracketed eaves, a decorative porch surrounding the main entrance, and a bell tower. A roof fire on April 2, 1918, did little damage to the structure. The current facility opened in September 1958 at a cost of $374,000. The three-story building is faced with tan brick and Indiana Limestone. The front facade is accented by deeply recessed windows framed by limestone-clad piers. The courthouse houses court and most administrative offices for Emmet County. ==References== Category:Government buildings completed in 1958 Category:Modernist architecture in Iowa Category:County courthouses in Iowa Category:Buildings and structures in Emmet County, Iowa ","title":"Emmet County Courthouse (Iowa)"},{"id":"46385998","text":"The Guthrie County Courthouse is located in Guthrie Center, Iowa, United States. The current facility is the fourth structure in Guthrie Center to house county administration and court functions since 1859. ==History== Prior to 1859, Panora was the county seat and the county clerk housed the records in his log cabin as there was no courthouse. He sold whiskey and gunpowder from the same building, and in 1857, he accidentally ignited a keg of gunpowder destroying the cabin and all its contents. An order for a courthouse had been issued in 1853, but it had not been built. Another order was issued in 1857, but it was annulled and the contractor was paid $200 in damages. A series of county seat battles ensued between Panora and Guthrie Center with each taking turns as the victor. The first courthouse for the county was a two-story frame building of native wood built in Panora in 1859. The building was subsequently removed from the center of the public square and it was replaced by a high school. The building itself became an agriculture warehouse. A new brick courthouse that was capped with a dome was completed in 1877 in Guthrie Center. The $22,500 building was paid for by the sale of swamp land in the county. On March 3, 1882, it was destroyed by fire. A clerk saved the county records. The following year, the third courthouse, a three-story, brick Renaissance Revival structure, was built, featuring cut-stone facings and trim. The construction cost was $25,000. This building would serve the county for 80 years. In 1963, the fourth courthouse was under construction in the courtyard next to the third courthouse when the older building was destroyed by fire on November 27, 1963. Luckily some of the records had already been removed from the old building so the loss wasn't as great as prior fires. The present courthouse is a three-story building that occupies a sloped site exposing the northern part of the ground level. The structure is modern in design and faced with red brick and accented by precast concrete panels.

The current facility is the third structure that Hamilton County has used to house county administration and court functions ==History== The first courthouse for the county was begun in 1858, but it had to be dismantled before it was completed because the county ran out of money to finish construction. A two-story frame courthouse was completed in the 1860s, and it was repurposed as a house in Webster City after the county built a new courthouse. Financing for the new courthouse provided difficult once again. The board of supervisors and voters agreed to sell swampland owned by the county to pay for it, but $5 an acre was considered too high and no one bought the land. At the same time, no contractor was willing to be paid in real estate and to put up the $50,000 bond required by the county. Finally, John M. Rice, a Chicago contractor, was awarded the contract in late 1875. He put up a $5,000 bond and was compensated with $30,000 in swampland funds and securities and in swampland. The $30,000 was provided by 32 Webster City residents who agreed to buy at $3.40 per acre. The three-story brick courthouse was designed by the architectural firm of Street & Baker, and dedicated on July 4, 1876. It featured round arch windows, a mansard roof and a cupola that was subsequently removed. The total cost of construction came to $37,837.17. The present courthouse was completed on the south side of Webster City in 1976.

The county signed a 99-year lease, for $1, which committed the county to stay in Maquoketa. A separate building was built for a courthouse in 1886. It was a 2½-story brick structure in the Second Empire style. By 1938, it had become too small and some county offices began to occupy another building. The previous courthouse stood on the same location as the present courthouse, and was torn down before the current building was constructed.

It is the third courthouse the county has used for court functions and county administration. For the first eleven years of the county's existence its government was housed in various buildings in Algona. Its first stand alone courthouse was a frame structure completed in 1867. An Italianate-style building with a high tower replaced it in 1874. A grand jury indicted several members of the board of supervisors alleging that construction bids were not given to the lowest bidders and non-courthouse funds were used in its construction. They were all found not guilty. After several grand jury inspections in the 1930s the building was labeled a fire hazard. A bond referendum to build a new courthouse passed on September 9, 1947, but the high cost of materials prevented construction at that time. By 1952 it was determined that further use of the old courthouse was no longer feasible. Plans were made for a new building and the old building was taken down in 1953. The present three-story, brick, Modernist structure was completed in 1955. The Des Moines architectural firm of Dougher, Rich & Woodburn designed the building, and Fagre Construction Company was the general contractor. It was built for about $500,000.

The technique was invented by Reed, Smith and Vetta. to show that the problem of odd cycle transversal was solvable in time , for a graph with vertices, edges, and odd cycle transversal number . Odd cycle transversal is the problem of finding the smallest set of vertices of a graph that include at least one vertex from every odd cycle; its parameterized complexity was a longstanding open question. . This technique later proved very useful in showing fixed-parameter tractability results. It is now considered to be one of the fundamental techniques in the area of parameterized algorithmics. Iterative compression has been used successfully in many problems, for instance odd cycle transversal (see below) and edge bipartization, feedback vertex set, cluster vertex deletion and directed feedback vertex set.. It has also been used successfully for exact exponential time algorithms for independent set.. ==Technique== Iterative compression applies, for instance, to parameterized graph problems whose inputs are a graph and a natural number , and where the problem is to test the existence of a solution (a set of vertices) of size . Suppose that the problem is closed under induced subgraphs (if a solution of size exists in a given graph, then a solution of this size or smaller also exists in every induced subgraph) and that there exists an efficient subroutine that determines whether a solution of size can be compressed to a smaller solution of size . If these assumptions are met, then the problem can be solved by adding vertices one at a time to an induced subgraph, and finding the solution to the induced subgraph, as follows: #Start with a subgraph induced by a vertex set of size , and a solution that equals itself. #While , perform the following steps: #*Let be any vertex of , and add to #*Test whether the -vertex solution } to can be compressed to a -vertex solution. #*If it cannot be compressed, abort the algorithm: the input graph has no -vertex solution. #*Otherwise, set to the new compressed solution and continue the loop. This algorithm calls the compression subroutine a linear number of times. Therefore, if the compression variant is solvable in fixed-parameter tractable time, i.e., f(k) · nc for some constant c, then the iterative compression procedure solving the entire problem runs in f(k) · nc+1 time. The same technique can be applied to finding sets of edges for graph properties closed under subgraphs (rather than induced subgraph), or for other properties beyond graph theory. When the value of the parameter is unknown, it can be found by using an outer level of exponential search or sequential search for the optimal choice of , with each step of the search based on the same iterative compression algorithm. ==Applications== In their original paper Reed et al. showed how to make a graph bipartite by deleting at most k vertices in time O(3k kmn). Later, a simpler algorithm was given, also using iterative compression, by Lokshstanov, Saurabh and Sikdar.. In order to compress a deletion set of size to a deletion set of size , their algorithm tests all of the partitions of into three subsets: the subset of that belongs to the new deletion set, and the two subsets of that belong to the two sides of the bipartite graph that remains after deleting . Once these three sets have been selected, the remaining vertices of a deletion set (if it exists) can be found from them by applying a max-flow min-cut algorithm. Vertex cover is another example for which iterative compression can be employed. In the vertex cover problem, a graph and a natural number are taken as inputs and the algorithm must decide whether there exists a set of vertices such that every edge is incident to a vertex in . In the compression variant of the problem, the input is a set of vertices that are incident to all edges of the graph, and the algorithm must find a set of size with the same property, if it exists. One way to do this is to test all choices of which subset of is to be removed from the cover and reintroduced back into the graph. Such a choice can only work if no two removed vertices are adjacent, and for each such choice, the subroutine must include in the cover all the vertices outside that are incident to an edge that becomes uncovered by this removal. Using this subroutine in an iterative compression algorithm gives a simple algorithm for vertex cover. ==See also== * Kernelization, a different design technique for fixed-parameter tractable algorithms ==References== Category:Graph algorithms Category:Parameterized complexity Category:Analysis of algorithms ","title":"Iterative compression"},{"id":"46386068","text":"Mark Gareth Creasy (born 1944) is a Western Australian mining entrepreneur.

Based in a building that had formerly been the North London Colosseum and Amphitheatre and then a cinema, in the 1960s and 1970s the club became one of the first venues to play black music in the United Kingdom. It was credited with playing a significant \\"role in the evolution of reggae into dance music, from ska, to rocksteady, to dub, to lovers, to dancehall and the evolution of jungle.\\" Many notable Afro-Caribbean musicians appeared at the Four Aces, which was often referred to as \\"the jewel in Dalston's crown\\".

The club was closed down in 1997, when Hackney Council exercised the right to a compulsory re-possession of the premises.

It at first operated from a run-down basement in Highbury Grove, but as growing crowds were attracted, a larger space was soon required, and The Four Aces relocated to 12 Dalston Lane in Dalston in Hackney. The disused Victorian theatre was originally built to house Robert Fossett's Circus in 1886Tim Burrows, \\"Four Aces, Phebes and London's Forgotten Reggae Venues\\", The Quietus, 8 July 2009. It was known as the North London Colosseum and Amphitheatre and elephants performed alongside acrobats and jugglers. It had then become a cinema before being used for storage. According to one description, \\"this multistoreyed, multi-roomed, Victorian-built hulk was labyrinthine – a reggae centre as if concocted in the mind of Jorge Luis Borges.\\" It was the first club to open in Hackney, and \\"quickly became a meeting point for newly arrived Afro-Caribbean immigrants experiencing cultural exile\\". By the 1970s, West Indians not only from other parts of London but from all around the UK were flocking to the club. The police took an interest and the club was regularly raided. Dunbar was prosecuted 14 times by the police but never convicted. Both local musicians and top international artists played and sang at the Four Aces Club, among them: Desmond Dekker, Jimmy Cliff, Roy Shirley, Alton Ellis, Prince Buster, the Upsetters, Ann Peebles, Percy Sledge, Ben E. King, Jimmy Ruffin, Billy Ocean,, the Ronettes and many others. Among the influential sound systems were Count Shelly, Fat Man, Jah Shaka and Sir Coxsone, with DJs vying to play at the Four Aces. In its heyday it was visited by the likes of Chrissie Hynde,, Bob Marley Mick Jagger, The Clash, Johnny Rotten, The Slits, Joe Strummer, and Bob Dylan. ==Club Labrynth== The Labrynth organisation was founded by Joe Wieczorek and originally hosted illegal warehouse rave parties during 1988 and 1989 at the height of the acid house scene. As it became increasingly difficult to secure warehouse space, Wieczorek started to look into using licensed premises for parties. Dunbar handed over control of the club to Wieczorek, and in early 1990 Club Labrynth was born. Through the 1990s the musical styles progressed from house through hardcore and finally onto jungle and Drum and bass. The resident DJs were Adrian Age, Vinyl Matt, Kenny Ken, and Billy Bunter. The Prodigy played their first live show at the club. When the Four Aces closed down, the club moved to Tottenham. ==Demolition== The club was closed in 1997 and eventually Hackney Council (which had bought the building from Tesco for £1.8million in 1977) exercised the right to a compulsory re-possession of the premises. A petition of 25,000 signatures was made asking for the building to be preserved. It was squatted but the campaign to return the space to community use was unsuccessful.\\"Former 4 Aces Club in battle against Dalston Babylon\\", Blood and Fire, 24 February 2006. Despite objections from the Theatres Trust, the Georgian Group and the Cinema Theatre Association, the building was demolished in 2007.

Construction on the line began in May 2013,Tramways & Urban Transit magazine, July 2013, p. 311. and it opened for public service on April 13, 2015. The streetcar line operates between downtown Dallas and Oak Cliff by way of the Houston Street Viaduct. The streetcar line originally operated from Union Station to Methodist Dallas Medical Center, but an extension to the Bishop Arts District opened on August 29, 2016. == Background == The Dallas Streetcar project is a collaborative endeavor among DART, the City of Dallas, and the North Central Texas Council of Governments (NCTCOG). The project received $23 million in initial funding via a federal TIGER grant awarded to DART in December 2010. An additional $3 million in federal stimulus dollars was later granted to the project. DART reallocated $22 million in local funds to the streetcar project which were originally scheduled for a proposed people-mover between Inwood Love/Field station and the Love Field airport terminal. In January 2013, NCTCOG approved reallocating $31 million in state funds, which were also earmarked for the proposed Love Field people-mover, to the streetcar project. The combined funding would allow for construction of both the first and second phases of the streetcar project. == Service ==  Phase 1 (Union Station to Dallas Methodist Medical Center)  Phase 1 of the Dallas Streetcar line, running from Union Station to Methodist Dallas Medical Center (the line's \\"Beckley\\" stop), opened on April 13, 2015. Service runs at 20-minute intervals on weekdays, with no cost to ride. In February 2016, streetcar operating hours will be expanded to between 9:30am and midnight weeknights, and will offer weekend service. Construction on Phase 1 began in May 2013. By September 2014, most track construction for Phase 1 had been completed.Tramways & Urban Transit magazine, October 2014, p. 440. The first of the two streetcars on order from Brookville was delivered on March 20, 2015. At the time of the phase 1 opening on April 13, 2015, the second streetcar vehicle had yet to be delivered.

On April 28, 2015, the DART board of directors approved a construction contract for the Bishop Arts extension. On June 17, 2015, the Dallas City Council agreed to fund Phase 2 construction using up to $27.5 million in available grant money. In preparation for the Phase 2 opening, DART said that the frequency of service would increase from 30 minutes to 20 minutes by introducing a second streetcar on the line. The extension opened on August 29, 2016.  Future expansion plans  Future plans for the streetcar line include extensions from Union Station to the Dallas Convention Center, and a connection to the McKinney Avenue Trolley via the Main Street District. The $92 million project, called the \\"Central Link\\", will use one of three alternatives traveling east from Union Station to Olive and St. Paul streets, where the McKinney Avenue Trolley already terminates. It will be built in conjunction with the \\"D2\\" light rail project. == Rolling stock == Car 302 in 2016 In February 2013, an order was placed with Brookville Equipment Corporation for two low-floor streetcars to provide the service on the line.

French naturalist Achille Valenciennes described the globehead parrotfish in 1840. The species was the first parrotfish collected by Charles Darwin—from the waters around Tahiti and then from the Cocos Islands; the former was described as a new species and given the name Scarus lepidus by Leonard Jenyns, while the latter was confirmed as the current species. In 1900, Henry Weed Fowler described a specimen from Caroline Island as Scarus pronus, which was later synonymised with this species. The globehead parrotfish can grow up to 45 cm (18 in) long and weigh up to 0.5 kg (1.1 lb). The adult male in terminal phase has a predominantly green body with its scales bordered with salmon pink. The tail fin is green with salmon-pink bands. It has a horizontal pink band bordered with green running from the snout through its eyes to the end of the opercle. It has 1 or 2 canine teeth on the upper and lower plates. Initial phase globehead parrotfish are grey-brown, their abdomens bearing three white bands.

It was founded in 2004 as an offshoot of the Beautiful Foundation, one of the most renowned charity organizations in Korea. Since then GongGam has grown from four to nine lawyers who work in the newly developing area of public interest law. GongGam is financed by mostly grassroots donations. ==Activities== GongGam provides legal support and advice to other non-governmental and non-profit organizations on issues relation to the protection of human rights and the elimination of discrimination. The organization also provides legal education to NGOs and other public interest groups. GongGam advises and provides representation in strategic litigation that highlights structural injustices that lead to repeated violations of human rights and systemic discrimination against minorities and the under privileged. The organization works towards reforming Korea's legal system and promoting specific public interest laws in order to foster an environment that is more responsive to the needs of minorities and the underprivileged. Lastly, GongGam develops programs for public interest lawyering and coordinates pro bono activities. == Impact on Korean society == GongGam's approach to public interest law is perhaps the most comprehensive and effective as it focuses on five major areas, including strategic litigation, legal aid projects, mediating pro bono activities, development of public interest programs, and research.  Women rights  2016: GongGam conducted a research on situation of migrant women's work environment in agriculture and the sexual violence against them. Most migrant women suffer from low wages and long working hours. More than half of them live in container boxes or vinyl houses offered as accommodation from their employers. Based on the research, GongGam held a conference to improve the housing condition of migrants, and it is pursuing legislative actions to amend the relevant law. 2015: GongGam represented four Filipino women who came to Korea on an entertainment (E-6-2) visa but ended up being sexually exploited in a foreigners-only club. In order to improve the process of protecting trafficked victims, GongGam advised the National Human Rights Commission of Korea on creating a 'Trafficking Victim Identification and Victim Protection Index'.  Migrants and refugees  GongGam has been working closely with migrant workers and foreign brides. GongGam successfully represented a young Vietnamese woman who was tricked into marrying a Korean man. This man and his Korean wife could not have a child after many years of trying, thus they staged a fake divorce. Afterwards, the Korean man came to Vietnam and marry the Vietnamese woman via international marriage broker. The Vietnamese plaintiff had to deliver two babies, yet she was deprived of the rights to take care of them immediately after they were born. As a result of this litigation, the defendants had to pay plaintiff a compensation amount of 200 million KRW (approximately 180,000 USD).  People with disabilities  2016: GongGam participated in the public hearing about Article 24 of the Mental Health Act in the Constitutional Court. Within this act, the compulsory admission of a patient made only by the agreement between 2 relatives and 1 psychiatrist is problematic because the Act specifies no reasonable legal or medical grounds. In 2016, the Constitutional Court finally decided that Article 24 is unconstitutional.  Precarious workers  2016: With the rise of app services in recent years, there is a growing practice of companies using alternative arrangements such as independent contractors to meet their staffing needs. GongGam represented a worker who was paralyzed after he had an accident during his regular delivery and whose employer refused to pay for medical services because of his employment status. GongGam is now waiting for a decision from the Supreme Court. 2014: GongGam represented the family of an apartment security guard who committed suicide following repeated maltreatment by some of the residents. In Korea, maltreatment of security guards both from the residents and their very own management company is a very prevalent issue. ==References== Category:2004 establishments in South Korea Category:Human rights organizations based in South Korea Category:Legal organizations based in South Korea Category:Organizations established in 2004 ","title":"GongGam Human Rights Law Foundation"},{"id":"46386252","text":"Pier Paolo Varotti (1686- 1732) was an Italian painter, active depicting sacred and historical subjects in a late-Baroque or Rococo style. ==Biography== He was born in Bologna (1686-1732), and became a follower of Giuseppe Maria Crespi.

It was recorded in May 1972 with musical assistance from various well-known members of the British folk rock scene. The album failed to make an impact on its original release, but it was subsequently championed by many musicians, including Billy Bragg, Arcade Fire, Richard Hawley and Jarvis Cocker. For years the album was difficult to obtain but in 2017, a re-release of Bright Phoebus was announced. ==Preface== Between 1965 and 1968 The Watersons, a four-piece family vocal group from Yorkshire, had made a name for themselves as an influential force in the British folk revival, singing old traditional folk songs and releasing their debut album Frost and Fire: A Calendar of Ritual and Magical Songs in 1965 to good critical acclaim. The album was produced by Tony Engle and was named \\"Melody Maker Album of the Year“. As several years of folk club touring took a toll on the musicians, the group members decided to take up regular jobs in 1968. Mike Waterson subsequently worked as a painter, Norma Waterson as a disc jockey on the Caribbean BOT island Montserrat, while Lal Waterson became a mother of two children and lived “with her extended family in a folk commune on the Yorkshire Moors“. The realisation of Bright Phoebus was propelled by Martin Carthy's fondness of Lal Waterson's songs, which he happened to overhear in 1971 in the early stages of his relationship with Lal Waterson's sister Norma. (Notably, Martin Carthy and Norma Waterson, who perform Red Wine & Promises together on the finished album, became engaged to one another during the recording sessions.) Consequently, Lal Waterson demoed a couple of her songs the very same year. Mike Waterson too contributed some of his songs to these preliminary sessions. Of this repertoire, versions of Lal's Never The Same, To Make You Stay and Red Wine And Promises, Mike's Shady Lady and their collaboration The Scarecrow survived as demo recordings. Most of them are performed solo by Lal Waterson on vocals and acoustic guitar, with occasional vocal harmonies or guitar parts by Mike Waterson. These recordings, plus other previously unissued songs of Lal's, were released on the CD/book combination Teach Me To Be A Summer's Morning in 2013 which illustrates both Lal Waterson's graphic, lyrical and musical art. The 1998 Lal Waterson obituary in The Daily Telegraph claims that Lal Waterson's Bright Phoebus songs had previously been conceived as poems which were only set to music later. Both Mike and Lal Waterson's songs seem to have arisen from everyday life; for instance, allegedly, the song Bright Phoebus occurred to Mike Waterson while standing on his ladder painting. ==Recording== The definitive album sessions took place in May 1972, once again under the direction of producer and folk Bill Leader. The recording process took one week and was characterised by guitarist Martin Carthy as “loose and very anarchic, but with an iron discipline running through the whole thing“. For instance, a postman - who might be Graham Gordon, who is credited in the liner notes - happened to deliver a package during the recording of Magical Man and was invited to join in with the chorus. The huge number of nineteen contributing musicians is reminiscent of Shirley Collins and the Albion Country Band's 1971 No Roses record, which was recorded by a total of twenty-six musicians; both albums featured Ashley Hutchings. The recording of Bright Phoebus coincided with the formation of Ashley Hutchings' Albion Country Band in April 1972, which had its debut live performance on 9 June 1972. The album sessions also effectively reunited most of the 1970-71 Mk 2 line-up of Steeleye Span (Carthy/Hutchings/Prior/Hart, minus Peter Knight), just a few months after Ashley Hutchings and Martin Carthy had left the group in November–December 1971 due to dissatisfaction with the management and the musical direction of the band. ==Material and reception== Seven of twelve songs are accompanied by acoustic guitars and occasional embellishments on cello, oboe and bass guitar; most of these songs feature intricate dual acoustic guitar arrangements by ex- Fairport Convention guitarist Richard Thompson and ex-Steeleye Span guitarist Martin Carthy. The remaining five songs are carried by the rhythm section of Ashley Hutchings' Morris On band, consisting of Ashley Hutchings on electric bass guitar, Richard Thompson on electric guitar and Dave Mattacks on drums. All three had previously played with Fairport Convention on their seminal Liege and Lief record in 1969, and released the Morris dance revival record Morris On in June 1972, some weeks ahead of the Bright Phoebus sessions. Critical reception of Bright Phoebus at that time was sparse and often negative. Technical and financial issues on the side of the record label resulted in a small edition of only 1000 functioning LP copies. Reactions by the folk scene ranged from astonishment to relative dismissal (for instance by Ewan MacColl), especially given that the Waterson family was known for 'authentic' delivery of traditional folk songs rather than for contemporary, sometimes pop-inspired songwriting. Positive response came from fellow folk revival musicians such as Anne Briggs and June Tabor. Contemporary reviews tend to praise the album. Among the catchphrases attributed to Bright Phoebus are descriptions such as \\"folk music's Sgt. Pepper\\", alluding to the eclectic nature of both albums. In the 1998 Guardian obituary of Lal Waterson Colin Irwin analyses that at the time of release “Lal's complex, brooding tales particularly confused the diehards.\\" He characterises her songs as “exceptionally durable\\" and highlights \\"The Scarecrow\\" as a stand-out track, comparing the imagery of this song with the works of Swedish film director Ingmar Bergman. Other authors describe \\"The Scarecrow\\" as \\"an achingly haunting ballad,\\" with implications of child sacrifice,Rob Young: Electric Eden, p. 194 and a song “laced with pagan horror.“ In his September 1998 The Independent obituary for Lal Waterson Karl Dallas too stresses the remarkability of \\"The Scarecrow\\"; additionally, he notices the “devastating picture of industrial poverty in 'Never The Same' as well as the “drunken reminiscence of 'Red Wine and Promises.'\\" In his 2011 book Electric Eden, Rob Young describes Bright Phoebus as “a curious response to the new directions in folk-rock that were taking place at the time.\\" Young compares the album's alternating “shades and sunny intervals“ with the unpredictability of English weather – a balancing act resolved by the “triumphant sun“ of the title track, which refers to phoebus - a different name of the ancient Greek solar god Apollo. On the musical side he finds elements of chamber music (\\"The Scarecrow,\\" \\"Winifer Odd\\"), musique concrète (\\"Rubber Band\\") and country rock (\\"The Magical Man\\") in the songs on the album. The AllMusic review by James Christopher Monger commends the accompanying ensemble for its song-serving and of-a-piece playing; he describes the title track as \\"a pagan campfire singalong that manages to both intrigue and inspire while simultaneously ripping your heart out for no apparent reason,\\" a sentiment which according to Monger applies to the whole album. ==Release history== Apart from a very basic, limited CD reissue in 1985 and CD-R reissue of dubious legal status (the legal status of this release was upheld as being genuine and legal following the 2017 Court Case) in 2000, the album had never received a proper re-release despite considerable interest of both the Watersons and folk music listeners to see the album reissued. Reasons for this included copyright issues and unavailability of the master tapes. The original Trailer Records LP is a much sought-after rarity which is sold at high prices. Four of the original twelve Bright Phoebus recordings appear on the following three compilation CDs: Magical Man on the 1996 Castle Music triple CD New Electric Muse: The Story of Folk into Rock; Never The Same and To Make You Stay on the 2005 Honest Jon's CD Never The Same – Leave-Taking from the British Folk Revival 1970-1977; and Rubber Band on the 2006 Castle Music double CD The Fairport Companion – Loose Chippings from the Fairport Convention Family Tree. In 2002, various folk musicians re-interpreted the Bright Phoebus songs, plus other material from Lal and Mike Waterson's backlog, and released these recordings on Topic Records as Shining Bright – The Songs of Lal & Mike Waterson. 2017 re-release A re-release of Bright Phoebus was announced in May 2017 with a complete set of remasters by David Suff and Marry Waterson, and sleeve notes by Pete Paphides. The album was re-released in a variety of packages by Domino Records on 4 August. The double CD version of Bright Phoebus comprises one disc of the re-mastered original album, and one disc of hitherto unreleased demos for the album. As of August 2017, the re-release of Bright Phoebus entered the UK Official Albums charts at #21. The 'lovingly remastered' Domino release attracted uniformly positive reviews. 2017 re- release court case The Domino Recording Company was found to be guilty of copyright infringement in relation to the 2017 re-issue of Bright Phoebus and Celtic Music's claims to the rights in the album were upheld by the UK High Court (based on the fact that they purchased the Leader and Trailer labels in 1990).http://celtic-music.co.uk/press/2018-12/Press_Release_Bright_Phoebus.pdf ==Track listing== Credits are specified in 2-3 rows for better overview: vocalists - rhythm section - additional instruments (where applicable).

This was the nation's sixteenth appearance at the Olympics, although it had previous competed in most editions under the name Burma. Myanmar did not attend the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal for political reasons. Myanmar Olympic Committee sent a team of seven athletes, four men and three women, to compete in five different sports at the Olympics. The nation's roster size was relatively larger by a single athlete than those sent to both Beijing 2008 and London 2012 with six each. Most of them were awarded places in their respective sporting events through wild card entries and Tripartite Commission invitations, with the exception of pistol shooter Ye Tun Naung, who qualified directly for the Games on merit. Half-heavyweight judoka Yan Naing Soe led the delegation as the nation's flag bearer in the opening ceremony. Myanmar, however, has yet to win its first Olympic medal. San Yu Htwe, who arrived in Rio de Janeiro on a Tripartite Commission invitation, overwhelmed some of the highest-ranked archers in two elimination rounds to produce a best result for Myanmar at the Games, before falling short of the third round to South Korea's defending champion Ki Bo-bae. ==Archery== Myanmar has received an invitation from the Tripartite Commission to send a female archer to the Olympic tournament. { style=\\"font-size:90%\\" - !rowspan=2Athlete !rowspan=2Event !colspan=\\"2\\"Ranking round !Round of 64 !Round of 32 !Round of 16 !Quarterfinals !Semifinals !colspan=\\"2\\"Final / - style=\\"font-size:95%\\" !Score !Seed !Opposition Score !Opposition Score !Opposition Score !Opposition Score !Opposition Score !Opposition Score !Rank - align=center align=leftSan Yu Htwe align=leftWomen's individual 608 51  W 7–3  W 7–3  L 0–6 colspan=4Did not advance } ==Athletics== Myanmar has received universality slots from IAAF to send two athletes (one male and one female) to the Olympics. ;Track & road events {class= style=\\"font-size:90%\\" - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Athlete !rowspan=\\"2\\"Event !colspan=\\"2\\"Heat !colspan=\\"2\\"Semifinal !colspan=\\"2\\"Final -style=\\"font-size:95%\\" !Time !Rank !Time !Rank !Time !Rank -align=center align=leftSan Naing align=leftMen's 5000 m 15:51.05 24 colspan=2 colspan=2Did not advance -align=center align=leftSwe Li Myint align=leftWomen's 800 m 2:16.98 8 colspan=4Did not advance } ==Judo== Myanmar has received an invitation from the Tripartite Commission to send a judoka competing in the men's half-heavyweight category (100 kg) to the Olympics. {  style=\\"font-size:90%\\" !rowspan=2Athlete !rowspan=2Event !Round of 64 !Round of 32 !Round of 16 !Quarterfinals !Semifinals !Repechage !colspan=2Final / -style=\\"font- size:95%\\" !Opposition Result !Opposition Result !Opposition Result !Opposition Result !Opposition Result !Opposition Result !Opposition Result !Rank -align=center align=leftYan Naing Soe align=leftMen's −100 kg   W 002–000  L 000–100 colspan=5Did not advance } ==Shooting== Myanmar has qualified one shooter in the men's pistol events by virtue of Ye Tun Naung's performances in the 2015 ISSF World Cup series and Asian Championships, as long as he obtained a minimum qualifying score (MQS) by March 31, 2016. {  style=\\"font-size:90%\\" !rowspan=\\"2\\"Athlete !rowspan=\\"2\\"Event !colspan=2Qualification !colspan=2Final -style=\\"font-size:95%\\" !Points !Rank !Points !Rank -align=center align=left rowspan=2Ye Tun Naung align=leftMen's 10 m air pistol 572 33 colspan=2Did not advance -align=center align=leftMen's 50 m pistol 552 17 colspan=2Did not advance } Qualification Legend: Q = Qualify for the next round; q = Qualify for the bronze medal (shotgun) ==Swimming== Myanmar have received a Universality invitation from FINA to send two swimmers (one male and one female) to the Olympics. {class= style=\\"font-size:90%\\" - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Athlete !rowspan=\\"2\\"Event !colspan=\\"2\\"Heat !colspan=\\"2\\"Semifinal !colspan=\\"2\\"Final -style=\\"font-size:95%\\" !Time !Rank !Time !Rank !Time !Rank -align=center align=leftThint Myaat align=leftMen's 100 m butterfly 1:02.54 43 colspan=4Did not advance -align=center align=leftEi Ei Thet align=leftWomen's 50 m freestyle 30.25 70 colspan=4Did not advance } ==References External links == * Category:Nations at the 2016 Summer Olympics 2016 Olympics ","title":"Myanmar at the 2016 Summer Olympics"},{"id":"46386466","text":"Bad Wound is an unincorporated community in Bennett County, in the U.S. state of South Dakota.

Twice yearly the Honours Committee submits formal recommendations for the British monarch's New Years and Birthday Honours. Members of the Honours Committee—which comprises a main committee and nine subcommittees in speciality areas—research and vet nominations for national awards, including knighthoods and the Order of the British Empire. ==History== The honours system is an ancient one, particularly in Britain; Æthelstan, King of the English in the 10th century, was knighted by his grandfather, Alfred the Great. Knighthoods were originally conferred as a military honour, often on the battlefield. Later it became customary for only the reigning monarch to bestow the honour. Other honours beyond knighthood were later established, including the Order of the Bath in 1725. In the 20th century, the \\"Ceremonial Branch\\" of the government was created in 1937 with the sole purpose of overseeing the honours system. In 2001, the committee became officially known as the Ceremonial Honours and Appointments Secretariat. Since 1993, members of the public have been eligible to nominate individuals; government agencies may also formally put forward candidates. All citizens of the United Kingdom and Commonwealth nations can be nominated. Non- citizens are eligible for honorary awards. Following his retirement as Permanent Secretary to the Lord Chancellor's Office, Sir Hayden Phillips prepared a report in July 2004 to the Cabinet Secretary suggesting a reform of the current honours nomination system. The next year, following recommendations made in Phillips' report, a new system of eight committees was organised, with each committee focussing on a special area. (In 2012, an additional committee was added.) The committees are composed of senior civil servants and independent experts in specific fields. The majority of the honours committees are non-civil servants. Each subcommittee oversees nominations for its specialised area: Arts and Media; Community, Voluntary and Local Services; Economy; Education; Health; Parliamentary and Political Service; Science and Technology; Sport; and State. The individual committees assess the nominations and pass the nominations to the Main Honours Committee, whose members select the final list of nominations that are passed to the Queen by the Prime Minister. Following the Cash for Honours scandal, the Main Honours Committee is required to determine that an individual's nomination for an honour has not been influenced by campaign and political contributions. According to the Cabinet Office's 2011 report, \\"The Main Honours Committee must satisfy itself that a party political donation has not influenced the decision to award an honour in any way; the committee must be confident that the candidate would have been a meritorious recipient of an honour if he or she had not made a political donation.\\" The Cabinet's Honours Committee nominates civilians only; military honours, such as the Victoria Cross and the George Cross, are sent to the Queen by the Honours and Decorations Committee of the Ministry of Defence. The honours committee also does not make nominations for peerages, which are created directly by the monarch. ==Committees== Main committee *Sir Jonathan Stephens KCB (Chair) *Chair of Arts and Media Committee: Rupert Gavin *Chair of Community, Voluntary and Local Services Committee: Dame Louise Casey DBE CB *Chair of the Economy Committee: Sir Ian Cheshire *Chair of Education Committee: Sir Daniel Moynihan *Chair of Health Committee: The Rt Hon.

She served at the Parliament. The founding publishing company was SanomaWSOY, which started its business activities in the magazine publishing sector with the establishment of Kotiliesi. The headquarters of the magazine is in Helsinki. Alli Viherheimo is the first editor-in-chief of Kotiliesi. Mandi Hannula, a woman member of the Parliament, contributed to the magazine in the 1920s. The magazine is part of the Otava Group and is published bimonthly by Otava Media Oy. Its former publisher was Yhtyneet Kuvalehdet Oy. Kotiliesi originally focused on articles about home economics, kitchen architecture and domestic duties. In 1968 the magazine covered articles on the need for reforms related to schooling, education, social security and employment patterns for women. At the end of the 1990s the magazine changed its focus from social topics and policies to personal well- being, families and babies. Later the magazine expanded its coverage to include articles on food, decoration, family business, health among the others. ==Circulation== Kotiliesi had a circulation of 645,000 copies in 2003.

It was released on March 14, 2015. It is based on the true story of a Japanese doctor working in Africa using information from letters sent home to the girl he left behind in Japan. The letters originally formed the basis for the popular 1987 Japanese song \\"Kaze ni Tatsu Lion\\" by Masashi Sada, who was encouraged by actor Takao Osawa to adapt the song into a novel. The novel was released in 2013 and was later adapted into the 2015 film directed by Takashi Miike. ==Plot== The young volunteer surgeons Katsuhiko Aoki and Kōichirō Shimada travel to Kenya to assist Dr. Murakami in his studies at the Institute of Tropical Medicine as well as in his treatment of locals. They are then sent for a month to Lokichogio to perform surgery on child soldiers and Kōichirō is so moved by his experience that he later asks to return to Lokichogio, where he is joined by Wakako Kusano. Kōichirō had previously had a relationship with Takako Akishima in Nagasaki and had invited her to come with him to Africa but she chose to remain with her family to eventually take over her father's medical practice. Prior to that, Kōichirō had stuttered in high school but was able to overcome it when he sang as a soloist in the school choir. An injured child soldier named Ndung'u is brought to the hospital in Lokichogio and Kōichirō operates on his leg but the boy is left using crutches. Ndung'u is very distrustful of others and his only intention is to return to life as a soldier. Kōichirō leaves the city to get supplies and Ndung'u is certain that he will not return. When Kōichirō returns, Ndung'u is surprised and reconsiders his plans for the future. He begins using his artistic talents to draw portraits of the doctors. After Kōichirō dresses up as Santa Claus and hands out Christmas presents to the children, Ndung'u decides to become a doctor to atone for his past crimes. Kōichirō decides to stay in Lokichogio instead of returning to Japan. Wakako privately sets up an orphanage. Takako takes over her father's practice. While attempting to visit an old patient, shots are fired at Kōichirō's vehicle and he is killed by a grenade. After the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake, an old woman whose illness was treated by Kōichirō visits the orphanage and donates a small bag of corn kernels to the people suffering in Japan. Ndung'u travels to the Tōhoku with the kernels and befriends an orphaned Japanese boy. ==Cast== *Takao Osawa as Kōichirō Shimada *Satomi Ishihara as Wakako Kusano *Yōko Maki as Takako Akishima *Masato Hagiwara as Katsuhiko Aoki *Ryōhei Suzuki *Ayako Fujitani as Satoko Kojima **Honoka Matsumoto as young Satoko *Kumi Nakamura as Kiyomi Akijima *Hajime Yamazaki as Seiichi Akijima *Renji Ishibashi as Masayuki Murakami *Nick Reding *Patrick Oketch as Afundi *Lydia Gitachu ==Reception== The film earned on its opening weekend in Japan. ==ReferencesCategory:2015 films Category:Films about child soldiers Category:Films about physicians Category:Films about surgeons Category:Films based on Japanese novels Category:Films based on songs Category:Films directed by Takashi Miike Category:Nippon TV films Category:Films set in 1977 Category:Films set in 1985 Category:Films set in 1986 Category:Films set in 1987 Category:Films set in 2011 Category:Films set in 2014 Category:Films set in Kenya Category:Films set in Miyagi Prefecture Category:Films set in Nagasaki Prefecture Category:Films set in Nagasaki Category:Japanese drama films Category:Japanese films Category:Japanese-language films Category:English-language films Category:Toho films Category:2015 drama films ja:風に立つライオン#映画 ","title":"The Lion Standing in the Wind"},{"id":"46386785","text":"The 2014 World RX of Belgium was the 6th round of the inaugural season of the FIA World Rallycross Championship.

Nathaniel Pearce (14 February 1779 – 12 August 1820) was an explorer who spent many years in Abyssinia (present-day Ethiopia) and wrote a journal of his experiences. ==Early life== Pearce was born in East Acton near London, and was educated at private schools, but, proving wild and incorrigible, was apprenticed to a carpenter and joiner in Duke Street, Grosvenor Square. He soon ran away to sea, and on his return was apprenticed to a leather-seller, whom he left suddenly to enlist on the man-of-war HMS Alert. In May 1794 he was taken prisoner by the French; but after many attempts succeeded in escaping, and served again in the navy. ==In Abyssinia== Many adventures followed. Deserting from in July 1804, Pearce seems to have made his way to Mocha, Yemen and become a Muslim, but managed to reach, on 31 December 1804, the vessel that was conveying Viscount Valentia's mission to Abyssinia. After he arrived at Massawa on the Red Sea coast, he accompanied, in the summer of next year, Henry Salt as an English servant on his mission to the court of Ras Wolde Selassie of Tigray. On Salt's departure in November, Pearce stayed behind in the service of the Ras. On more than one occasion he was compelled by jealous intriguers to quit the court, but by the autumn of 1807 he had made his position there secure. In 1808 he married the daughter of Sidee Paulus, a Greek. In 1810 he met Salt's second expedition, and escorted it from the coast and back. Pearce remained in Abyssinia till 1818, when he set out for Cairo on a visit to Salt. He reached Cairo in 1819, and, after a journey up the Nile, returned there and died in Alexandria from the results of exposure on 12 August 1820.

He was elected at the general election in February 1874 as the Member of Parliament (MP) for the parliamentary borough of Midhurst in Surrey. However, he succeeded to the peerage on 2 August that year, taking both the Irish title of Earl of Egmont and the title Baron Arden in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. The latter title gave him a seat in House of Lords, thereby vacating his seat in the House of Commons. He was promoted from lieutenant to captain in the Yeomanry on 25 November 1874.

Wards in dark grey were not contested in 2012. The 2012 Carlisle City Council election took place on 3 May 2012 to elect members of Carlisle District Council in Cumbria, England. One third of the council was up for election and the Labour party gained overall control of the council from no overall control. After the election, the composition of the council was *Labour 27 *Conservative 20 *Liberal Democrats 2 *Independent 2 *Vacant 1 ==Background== After the last election in 2011 Labour were the largest party with 24 seats, while the Conservatives had 22, the Liberal Democrats had 4 and there were 2 independents. However the Conservatives continued to lead the council with Liberal Democrat support, meaning that before the 2012 election Labour needed to make 2 gains to take control of the council. One seat was vacant at the 2012 election in Harraby after the death of Labour councillor Dave Weedall in April 2012. 17 seats were contested in 2012 and as well as Conservative and Labour candidates, there were also 11 candidates each from the UK Independence Party and the Green Party, 8 candidates from the Liberal Democrats, 2 independents and 1 candidate each from the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition and the British National Party. The election in Carlisle brought national politicians to support their parties, with both the Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron and the Labour Leader of the Opposition Ed Miliband visiting Carlisle during the campaign. ==Election result== Labour became the first party to have a majority on Carlisle City Council since 2003, after taking 2 seats each from the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats. This took Labour to 27 of the 52 seats on the council, while the Conservatives dropped to 20 councillors and the Liberal Democrats fell to 2 seats. There remained 2 independents and a further seat was vacant. Overall turnout at the election was 33.9%. The Labour gains from the Conservatives came in Belle Vue and Yewdale wards, with Labour across the seats contested winning 4,530 more votes than Conservatives. Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrats only held one seat in Dalston, where sitting councillor Trevor Allison was re-elected, after losing two seats in Castle and Morton to Labour. Following the election the Labour group leader Joe Hendry became the new leader of Carlisle City Council, while John Mallinson became leader of the Conservative group on the council, after defeating the Conservative leader of the council from 1999 to 2012, Mike Mitchelson, in a leadership election. ==Ward resultsBy-elections between 2012 and 2014== Harraby A by- election was held in Harraby on 21 June 2012 after the death of the longest serving councillor, Labour's Dave Weedall.

Yewdale A by-election was held in Yewdale on 5 September 2013 after the death of the former leader of the council, Labour's Joe Hendry. The seat was held for Labour by Tom Dodd with a majority of 263 votes over Conservative Christina Finlayson. Dalston A by-election was held in Dalston on 17 October 2013 after Conservative councillor Nicola Clarke resigned from the council as she was moving away from the area.

Only a few were produced. ==Design and development== Apart from its folding wings, the C.68 was a conventional single bay biplane with rectangular plan wings of similar span, mounted without stagger. Ailerons were fitted only on the upper wings. The outer interplane struts were in parallel pairs and the upper wing was supported over the fuselage on four upright cabane struts. The forward pair of these were unusual in extending down to the lower fuselage longerons and in being split vertically; the inner halves linked the centre section and fuselage and the outer halves were extra interplane struts. To fold the wings a short section of the centre section trailing edge was folded back to make room for the part of the upper wing aft of its hinge and the lower, outer, normally concealed part of the cabane/interplane strut swung out of its slot in the fuselage. The rear part of the lower wing cleared the fuselage underside. The aileron cables ran within the wing and did not need to be disconnected for folding thanks to wires that prevented them slackening. The C.68 was powered by a Anzani 6-cylinder two row radial engine, mounted without a cowling and driving a two blade propeller. Behind the engine the fuselage was flat sided, though the underside had a curved profile and there was curved upper decking. It had two open cockpits, one under the wing and the second just aft of the trailing edge. The C.68's fin was triangular and broad, carrying a vertical edged unbalanced rudder which extended down to the keel. Its tailplane was mounted on top of the fuselage with its elevators notched to allow rudder movement. It had a tailskid undercarriage with its mainwheels on a single long axle sprung on two V-form struts from the lower fuselage longerons. Folding and deploying the wings was straightforward and rapid, taking less than four minutes. Folding began by pinning on a tailskid extension to keep the lower wings off the ground. This extension could also link the folded C.68 behind a car for towing. The C.68's folded width was less than its height. The C.68 was first flown in 1922 and was on display at the 1922 Paris Salon, which opened on 15 December. Another C.68 was flown to Paris by Becheler who landed it in front of the Grand Palais on 16 December 1922, then gave a demonstration of its folding wings. Four C.68s appeared on the French Civil Register. In total six C.68s were built, of which a single example survives ad is in airworthy condition. ==SpecificationsReferences== C.068 Category:1920s French sport aircraft Category:Single-engined tractor aircraft Category:Biplanes Category:Aircraft first flown in 1922 ","title":"Caudron C.68"},{"id":"46386941","text":"The Ruby Red Performers are an amateur burlesque dancing troupe from the English seaside town of Withernsea, near Hull. ==Biography== In April 2015, twelve members of the Ruby Red Performers appeared on series 9 of the primetime ITV variety show Britain's Got Talent. They attended an audition held in the Lowry Theatre in MediaCity Salford where they performed a routine dressed as 1950s cleaning women dancing to Queen's \\"I Want to Break Free\\". Early on into their routine, Simon Cowell pressed his buzzer to indicate that he did not like the act, but shortly afterwards there was a tempo change in the routine and the women stripped down to large pairs of underwear, much to the delight of the audience and judges. After their performance, Cowell admitted that he had pressed his buzzer too early and suggested that the British Royal Family might like to see the act perform. They were given four 'yes' votes by the panel, allowing them to progress in the competition. On 25 May 2015, The Ruby Red Performers performed live in the first semi final along with eight other acts but came in last place in the public vote, therefore not advancing to the final. The group began their routine dressed as lollipop ladies before stripping down to black underwear and exploding bras. Their routine received favourable comments from the judges but they were criticised for their physical appearance on Twitter by columnist Kate Hopkins and former Strictly Come Dancing dancer James Jordan, with these comments being picked up by the national press. Jordan described the Ruby Reds as \\"fat old birds\\" whilst Hopkins, who is famous for her outspoken vitriolic comments, said their act was about women \\"being confident about their bodies and eating pork pies\\". The group responded by tweeting a photograph of them all on the bus back to Withernsea eating pork pies. Other appearances On 13 April 2015, following their debut performance on Britain's Got Talent, two members of the group gave their first television interview to Amanda Holden and Phillip Schofield on the live daytime magazine show This Morning. The group's leader, who goes by the name of Ruby, presented Holden with a pair of the nipple tassels worn by the ladies during their routine and Holden tried them out live on air. ==Popular culture== ITV's debut episode of its satirical puppet animation comedy show Newzoids which was aired on 15 April 2015 featured a sketch where Prince Charles and Camilla, the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall, were watching Britain's Got Talent in the style of the Channel 4 series Gogglebox. As Charles hears a reference to the \\"stripping grannies\\" he announces \\"Bloody hell!

His main exposition of his philosophical thinking is A Philosophy of the Unsayable (2014), a book which dwells on the limits of language in order to open thought to the inconceivable. On this basis, the discourses of myth, mysticism, metaphysics, and the arts take on new and previously unsuspected types of meaning. This book is the object of a Syndicate Forum and of a collective volume of essays by diverse hands in the series “Palgrave Frontiers in Philosophy of Religion”: Contemporary Debates in Negative Theology and Philosophy. Franke's apophatic philosophy is based on his two-volume On What Cannot Be Said: Apophatic Discourses in Philosophy, Religion, Literature, and the Arts (2007), which reconstructs in the margins of philosophy a counter-tradition to the thought and culture of the Logos. Franke extends this philosophy in an intercultural direction, entering the field of comparative philosophy, with Apophatic Paths from Europe to China: Regions Without Borders. == Biography == Franke holds degrees in philosophy and theology from Williams College and Oxford University and in comparative literature from UC Berkeley and Stanford (Ph.D. 1991). He lectures and teaches in English, German, French, and Italian. He is a research fellow of the Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung and a senior fellow of the International Institute for Hermeneutics (IIH). He has been Fulbright-University of Salzburg Distinguished Chair in Intercultural Theology and the Study of Religions. He is a member of \\"HolyLit: Religion and Literature,\\" of the Freie Universität Berlin and Harvard University and has been a member of the Dante Society Executive Council by general election of the Dante Society of America. == Work == Franke's philosophical work intertwines with his production as a theorist in comparative literature. His interdisciplinary approach centers on Dante’s Divine Comedy read as theological revelation in poetic language. His book, Dante’s Interpretive Journey (1996) constructs an interpretation of the Comedy in dialogue with German hermeneutic theory (Heidegger, Gadamer, Fuchs, Ebeling, Bultmann). The sequel, Dante and the Sense of Transgression: The Trespass of the Sign (2012), complements it by bringing the Comedy into dialogue with contemporary French thought of difference (Bataille, Blanchot, Barthes, Levinas, Derrida). While using the instruments of contemporary literary theory to read Dante's poem, these books also leverage Dante's medieval theological vision in order to level critiques against modern thinking forgetful of its grounds in sources that transcend rational justification and can only be imagined. Franke's work of speculative criticism powered by philosophical reflection is shaped into a comprehensive poetics of revelation starting with Poetry and Apocalypse: Theological Disclosures of Poetic Language (2009). This involves a construction of Christian epic tradition extending backward from James Joyce to Dante's essential source texts in antiquity and the Middle Ages with The Revelation of Imagination: From the Bible and Homer through Virgil and Augustine to Dante (2015). Moving in the opposite direction, Secular Scriptures: Modern Theological Poetics in the Wake of Dante (2016) traces the inheritance of Dante's theological vision forward into the modern era of secularized prophetic poetry and poetics. These critical interventions are at the same time theoretical employments of literature to engage certain of the chief intellectual problems of our own time, beginning from the status of knowledge as science and as revelation. Franke has published well over a hundred essays and articles of philosophical and theological interpretations of literature ranging from the biblical prophets and classical poets to Shakespeare and Milton, Dickinson, Baudelaire, Edmond Jabès, and Paul Celan. These essays deal also with theoretical topics such as dialectical and deconstructive logic, figurative rhetoric, psychoanalysis as a hermeneutics of subjectivity, postsecular critical reason, and cultural theory in the wake of the death of God. Those of a more literary- critical bent include interventions on the canon debate, world literature, postcolonial ethics, and postmodern (non)identities. ==Bibliography== *A Theology of Literature: The Bible as Revelation in the Tradition of the Humanities.
