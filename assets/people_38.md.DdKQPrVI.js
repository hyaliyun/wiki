Student activities are generally designed to allow students to become more involved on campus. Often, such activities provide the students with opportunities to develop leadership, social responsibility, citizenship, volunteerism, and employment experience. These activities are typically overseen by a Director of Student Activities, Student Affairs, or Student Engagement who may hold a Master's degree in student development (or a comparable field). The Director will guide the clubs and programs in their operations, set the minimum standards that these organizations should achieve, and help these organizations network with similar organizations at other institutions. External organizations like the National Association for Campus Activities (NACA) or the Association for the Promotion of Campus Activities (APCA) are good platforms for such cross-institutional networking to take place.APCA website == Types of student activities == Student activities generally fall under one or more of the following categories: === Academic === Academic student activities refer to clubs and programs specifically focused on helping a student in the academic sense. These can be major-based, area of study-based clubs, or programs and events designed to educate students in any scholarly subject matter. Some examples of academic student activities include: * Accounting Society * Language Clubs * Art History Club * Public Relations Student Society * Pre-Law Society === Civic Engagement === Civic engagement student activities generally refer to clubs and programs focused on creating positive societal change. Some of these activities may also fall under the academic category, as these activities work to educate students about social issues and the importance of getting involved. Some examples of civic engagement activities include: * Action in Africa * Colleges Against Cancer * Lions Club School Chapters * Circle K International * Political Party-Based Clubs * College/University Day of Service === Diversity/Cultural === Diversity or cultural student activities generally refer to clubs and programs focused on the representation of minority groups on campus. These activities may also fall under the academic category as they seek to educate students on cultural differences. Some examples of diversity/cultural activities include: * Black Student Union * Asian Pacific Student Association * Feminist Club * LGBT Alliance * Disability Alliance * Diversity Training Programs === Honor Societies === Honor societies are student activities that recognize academic excellence among students. These organizations are usually exclusive to students who have excelled academically, based on scholastic ranking and/or grade point average. Honor societies are typically national or even international organizations that have established chapters at certain colleges and universities. Some examples of honor societies include: * National Society of Leadership & Success * National Society of Collegiate Scholars * Alpha Kappa Delta * Mortar Board National College Senior Honor Society * Phi Beta Kappa === Leisure === Leisure clubs are student activities that give students the opportunity to connect with other students with similar hobbies and are an opportunity to socialize and take a break from the academic side of student life. Some examples of leisure activities include: * Acapella/singing groups * Acting clubs * Fan clubs * Cooking clubs === Recreational === Recreational activities are student activities that involve some form of physical activity. Some examples of recreational activities include: * Dance classes * Intramural Sports teams * Club sports * Surfing clubs * Sports tournaments Some examples of athletic activities include: *Football *Baseball *Soccer *Volleyball *Wrestling *Basketball *Golf *Hockey *Cricket === Religious/Spiritual === Religious/spiritual student activities refer to clubs and programs that allow students to connect with other students of similar faiths, practice their chosen faith, and/or learn about other faiths. Many schools have a faith center where these sorts of programs take place. Some examples of religious/spiritual activities include: * Interfaith Council * Fellowship of Christian Athletes * International Justice Mission * Latter-Day Saint Student Association * Groups for minorities that may fit into the religion of Pagan, etc. === Student-Run Event Planning Board === A student-run event planning board is a student activity that works under a faculty advisor to plan events for students, including concerts, speakers, dances, movie screenings, etc. Generally, this board is also responsible for hosting specific traditional events. These types of groups are often funded by grants from the college or university. === Student-Run Businesses === Student-run businesses are student activities that involve running a business that has an affiliation with the college or university and is almost completely, if not completely, run by student workers. Some examples of student-run businesses include: * College/University Radio Stations * College/University Local Television Stations * Production Company * Advertising Firms === National === National clubs refer to student activities that exist throughout the country. * Habitat for Humanity * Honors Across State/Country Borders * Engineering Without Borders * Global Brigades === Greek Organizations === Greek organizations include fraternities and sororities, which are exclusive social organizations. These groups are referred to as 'Greek' because their names are made up of two or three Greek letters, and generally focus on the betterment and empowerment of members. Students go through a 'bidding' process in order to be initiated into one of these organizations. Universities and colleges also have Panhellenic and Inter-Fraternity Councils, which act as the governing body over Greek organizations. Some honor societies can also be considered Greek organizations due to their Greek letter affiliation. These organizations, however, tend to be co-ed, while fraternities are all-male groups and sororities are all-female groups. Some examples of Greek organizations are: * Alpha Gamma Delta * Delta Tau Delta * Pi Beta Phi * Alpha Epsilon Pi == High school == Compared to college, high school provides a platform to experiment and build a concrete foundation for further education. Students can join various clubs such as student government, athletics, and science olympiad to make one well rounded and diversified. Participation in these clubs not only boosts one's resume for college applications but also provides essential skills they can use in the future. These skills include teamwork, organizational skills, leadership, critical thinking, and social skills. Early development of these skills allows the student to hone and sharpen them during their time in upper education. == Benefits == Participating in such clubs can impact the academic and social performance of the student involved based on their level of involvement. Skills such as academic autonomy, cultural participation, educational involvement, life management, and establishing and clarifying purpose increase in direct relation to the level of involvement. Students who participate in club activities in their freshman year have a greater chance of continuing participation throughout their senior year. Due to this increasing time spent interacting within the club, it was also found that students who stay involved are more likely to move up the hierarchical chain of power i.e. member to the treasurer to the president. These board positions, while hard to achieve unless given the position, can lead to substantial benefits to the student in both the long and short term. In the short term, the student will be exposed to unique challenges that will force the student to voice their opinion as well as making critical decisions. By achieving such positions, the students can make positive changes in ways that they see fit or in ways to improve the quality and caliber of the club. Both the student and the club benefit from such actions, the club will build off of the new leadership while the student will mature and develop essential skills. When looking at the long term effects, the skills learned will help the student in upper-level classes as well as applying to jobs and post graduate programs, which is the next step in any student's career. Engagement in such activities can help the student by providing more credentials so he/she can apply for upper-level positions and schools. In addition, there is greater personal growth both in the workplace and mind as well as giving back to the community in the form of volunteering. == Disadvantages == Spending too much time in a club can potentially have negative effects on the student's studies. Clubs require commitment physically, mentally, and in the value of time. With that being so, taking time and energy away from one's studies in order to fulfill the clubs commitment can hinder academic performance. Breaking such commitments can lead to one being kicked out or preventing one from participating in future club events. In some cases, clubs may require a travelling aspect where a student must not only devote time but also weekend and breaks due to their commitments. Noting that students do pursue certain clubs for resume purposes, some leaders of the clubs might not be as dedicated as others. Though the lack of quality does leave the door open for the student to correct and improve it, the value of time must still be considered. While this isn't the case for all clubs, understanding the quality, atmosphere, and emotions the leaders present can give valuable insight on how the club will perform. For clubs that tend to travel within or out of the state are not typically funded by the university or college. Clubs do tend to provide ways for the student to gather money such as fundraising, drives, or club hosted activities. On one hand, it does provide the student to explore the world through a college setting, on the other hand, it does take time and money to complete such trips. Students who are considering joining clubs must ultimately decide whether the trip and accessories of the club are worth those sacrifices. == How to get involved == Campuses offer a variety of ways to introduce incoming and current students to the student activities that are held on campus. Involvement fairs are a common enrollment method where groups have designated a booth, giving them a platform to generate interest in their activities. From there, students are able to walk through these booths, chatting and learning what the clubs do, what their beliefs are, their mission, cost, etc. A quick and efficient way for students to talk to a variety of clubs in a short amount of time to figure out how and what they can get involved in. These fairs are normally held once a year typically in the first half of both semesters. Websites are also used that allow the student to input keywords or phrases to search and filter clubs within the university. From there, the user can then gather contact information, read quick biographies about the club, and look at photos to get a sense of the club. Other ways of getting involved are through friends, word of mouth, other clubs, or through flyers and posters around campus. == Additional benefits and disadvantages  Increasing Social Network === Students can find it difficult to make friends with random people. Participating in clubs allows students to find common ground between others which can hopefully start a friendship. These friendships are essential in college as they provide a place for social interaction, others to study with, people to eat with, and more. === Networking === Meeting people and creating connections provide opportunities in the future when searching for jobs. Even if the connection is weak, the more connections one has the higher the chance he/she has when job searching. Those connections can either direct or recommend their friends to those who are hiring in hopes to land a job. === Resume === A resume is a list of accomplishments an individual has achieved throughout their lifetime that they wish to include when applying for a job. The resume and quality of it are essential when applying as it is a direct representation of the individual it belongs to. Participation in clubs and organizations allows the student to add that information to the resume and in turn making it stronger. If the student can reach upper-level positions within the club, that too can add to the resume. === Lack of downtime === Not participating in clubs can impact the college experience as it increases the amount of downtime the student has. A deceiving problem to have as if a student feels that he/she has more time to complete work they might push it back decreasing their use of time and increasing their procrastination. Also, having a more structured schedule allows the student to have consistency and rhythm throughout the week which can aid in planning, time management and ease of mind. == References == Category:Student culture ","title":"Student activities"},{"id":"20522430","text":"New Horizons Computer Learning Centers is the world's largest independent IT training company with over 300 locations in 72 countries.

Written and first published in 1959, long after his earlier books were out of print, Fortunes for All encapsulates and expands on his earlier books with all the benefit of long hindsight. In his book Vash sets out the philosophy and methods he used to attain his own success and sets them in the context of his personal history and of the social and economic environment of the times. ==Synopsis== The opening chapters of Fortunes for All set out Vash Young's credentials: the long, happy and rewarding life that he has enjoyed - his 'Fortune' - through taking his own advice and living by the rules he formulated as a young man. Vash then turns to his early life of hardship, poverty, hunger and deprivation and candidly reveals how he squandered early opportunities as a young man through self-doubt and moral weakness. Vash Young then describes the flash of insight the enabled him to re-invent himself. This was the defining point in his life when Vash the failure changed virtually overnight into Vash the success. The bulk of the book explains in detail the methods he used to give himself the mindset needed to find his Fortune. These lessons are amply illustrate by anecdotes taken from his own life and from those of people he encountered. Vash goes out of his way to show that what he did is relevant to anyone at any time or place.

The original Harveys department store was opened by Fred Harvey in 1942 at the corner of 6th Avenue North and Church Street in Nashville, Tennessee. The site was the former home of a post- Reconstruction Nashville retailer, Lebeck Brothers/Denton & Company, which rose to prominence in the 1870s. When the Lebeck Brothers’ property became available due to the store's closing, Fred Harvey founded Harveys department store on the property. The store expanded to eventually cover the entire block of Church Street from 6th Avenue to 5th Avenue. The store brought the first escalators to Middle Tennessee and the decor featured several carousel horses which had been salvaged from Glendale Park, a local amusement park that closed during the Great Depression. The store was also known for its lavish Christmas decorations as well as the annual Nativity scene it sponsored in Centennial Park. In 1960, Harveys, along with several other downtown Nashville stores, was the site of sit-in demonstrations, in which local college students protested against racially segregated lunch-counters. Harveys officially desegregated its lunch-counters on May 10, 1960. After two decades of successful growth at its downtown location, Harveys expanded to other locations. Harveys opened suburban branch stores at Madison Square Shopping Center (1962; Madison, TN) and 100 Oaks Shopping Center (1967; Nashville, TN). Stores were also opened in surrounding Middle Tennessee cities, including Clarksville, Columbia, Cookeville, and Murfreesboro, Tennessee, as well as Madisonville and Hopkinsville, Kentucky. One West Tennessee store was also opened in Dyersburg. By the 1980s, however, the popularity of suburban shopping malls led to declining sales at Harveys downtown Nashville location. The original store was closed in January 1984 and torn down to make way for a parking lot. In the late 1980s, Harveys announced another suburban Nashville store at 4724 Lebanon Road in Hermitage. Prior to the opening, the chain of stores was sold to Virginia-based Peebles in 1988. ==References== Category:Defunct department stores based in Tennessee Category:Defunct companies based in Tennessee Category:Companies based in Nashville, Tennessee Category:American companies established in 1942 Category:Retail companies established in 1942 Category:Retail companies disestablished in 1988 Category:1942 establishments in Tennessee Category:1988 disestablishments in Tennessee Category:History of Nashville, Tennessee ","title":"Harveys (department store)"},{"id":"20522465","text":"Kələbaq (also, Kələbağ) is a village in the municipality of Rustov in the Quba Rayon of Azerbaijan. ==References== Category:Populated places in Quba District (Azerbaijan) ","title":"Kələbaq"},{"id":"20522474","text":"Məçkə-Xacə (also, Məçkə-xacə) is a village in the municipality of Rustov in the Quba Rayon of Azerbaijan. ==References== Category:Populated places in Quba District (Azerbaijan) ","title":"Məçkə-Xacə"},{"id":"20522483","text":"Cadarı is a village in the municipality of Rustov in the Quba Rayon of Azerbaijan. ==References== Category:Populated places in Quba District (Azerbaijan) ","title":"Cadarı"},{"id":"20522488","text":"The Stockholm municipal election of 1998 was held on 15 September 1998, concurrently with the 1998 Swedish general election.

The results for the Social Democrats were the lowest in decades, and for the first time since the initiation of universal male suffrage in 1911, the Moderates outnumbered the Social Democrats to become the largest party on the Stockholm City Council as a result of this election. ==Results== {  border=\\"1\\" - colspan=2 rowspan=2 cellpadding=10 align=\\"center\\"Party colspan=3 cellpadding=10 align=\\"center\\"Votes colspan=2 cellpadding=10 align=\\"center\\"Seats - cellpadding=\\"10\\" align=\\"center\\"# cellpadding=\\"10\\" align=\\"center\\"% cellpadding=\\"10\\" align=\\"center\\"+ – cellpadding=\\"10\\" align=\\"center\\"# cellpadding=\\"10\\" align=\\"center\\"+ – - bgcolor= width=\\"5\\" cellpadding=\\"10\\" align=\\"left\\"Moderate Party Moderaterna (m) cellpadding=\\"10\\" align=\\"center\\"146,797 cellpadding=\\"10\\" align=\\"center\\"32.9% cellpadding=\\"10\\" align=\\"center\\"+4.3% cellpadding=\\"10\\" align=\\"center\\"35 cellpadding=\\"10\\" align=\\"center\\"+6 - bgcolor= width=\\"5\\" cellpadding=\\"10\\" align=\\"left\\"Social Democrats Socialdemokraterna (s) cellpadding=\\"10\\" align=\\"center\\"114,118 cellpadding=\\"10\\" align=\\"center\\"25.6% cellpadding=\\"10\\" align=\\"center\\"–7.4% cellpadding=\\"10\\" align=\\"center\\"29 cellpadding=\\"10\\" align=\\"center\\"–8 - bgcolor= width=\\"5\\" cellpadding=\\"10\\" align=\\"left\\"Left Party Vänsterpartiet (v) cellpadding=\\"10\\" align=\\"center\\"54,663 cellpadding=\\"10\\" align=\\"center\\"12.3% cellpadding=\\"10\\" align=\\"center\\"+3.1% cellpadding=\\"10\\" align=\\"center\\"13 cellpadding=\\"10\\" align=\\"center\\"+2 - bgcolor= width=\\"5\\" cellpadding=\\"10\\" align=\\"left\\"Liberal People's Party Folkpartiet liberalerna (fp) cellpadding=\\"10\\" align=\\"center\\"34,789 cellpadding=\\"10\\" align=\\"center\\"7.8% cellpadding=\\"10\\" align=\\"center\\"–0.1% cellpadding=\\"10\\" align=\\"center\\"9 cellpadding=\\"10\\" align=\\"center\\"±0 - bgcolor= width=\\"5\\" cellpadding=\\"10\\" align=\\"left\\"Christian Democrats Kristdemokratiska samlingspartiet (kd) cellpadding=\\"10\\" align=\\"center\\"28,320 cellpadding=\\"10\\" align=\\"center\\"6.4% cellpadding=\\"10\\" align=\\"center\\"+4.3% cellpadding=\\"10\\" align=\\"center\\"6 cellpadding=\\"10\\" align=\\"center\\"+6 - bgcolor= width=\\"5\\" cellpadding=\\"10\\" align=\\"left\\"Green Party Miljöpartiet (mp) cellpadding=\\"10\\" align=\\"center\\"26,347 cellpadding=\\"10\\" align=\\"center\\"5.9% cellpadding=\\"10\\" align=\\"center\\"–1.9% cellpadding=\\"10\\" align=\\"center\\"6 cellpadding=\\"10\\" align=\\"center\\"–2 - bgcolor=\\"purple\\" width=\\"5\\" cellpadding=\\"10\\" align=\\"left\\"Stockholm Party Stockholmspartiet (sp) cellpadding=\\"10\\" align=\\"center\\"19,561 cellpadding=\\"10\\" align=\\"center\\"4.4% cellpadding=\\"10\\" align=\\"center\\"NA cellpadding=\\"10\\" align=\\"center\\"3 cellpadding=\\"10\\" align=\\"center\\"+1 - bgcolor= width=\\"5\\" cellpadding=\\"10\\" align=\\"left\\"Centre Party Centerpartiet (c) cellpadding=\\"10\\" align=\\"center\\"9,187 cellpadding=\\"10\\" align=\\"center\\"2.1% cellpadding=\\"10\\" align=\\"center\\"–3.3% cellpadding=\\"10\\" align=\\"center\\"0 cellpadding=\\"10\\" align=\\"center\\"–5 - colspan=\\"2\\" cellpadding=\\"10\\" align=\\"left\\"Other parties cellpadding=\\"10\\" align=\\"center\\"11,942 cellpadding=\\"10\\" align=\\"center\\"2.7% cellpadding=\\"10\\" align=\\"center\\"NA cellpadding=\\"10\\" align=\\"center\\"0 cellpadding=\\"10\\" align=\\"center\\"±0 - colspan=7 - colspan=\\"2\\" cellpadding=\\"10\\" align=\\"left\\"Total cellpadding=\\"10\\" align=\\"center\\"445,724 cellpadding=\\"10\\" align=\\"center\\"100% cellpadding=\\"10\\" align=\\"center\\"— cellpadding=\\"10\\" align=\\"center\\"101 cellpadding=\\"10\\" align=\\"center\\"±0 - colspan=\\"2\\" cellpadding=\\"10\\" align=\\"left\\"Invalid ballots cellpadding=\\"10\\" align=\\"center\\"8,469 } ==See also== * Elections in Sweden * List of political parties in Sweden * City of Stockholm ==Notes== : No separate election results were available for the Stockholm Party for the 1994 Stockholm municipal election, and thus year-to-year vote comparison is not possible. ==References== *Statistics Sweden, \\"Kommunfullmäktigval – valresultat\\" (Swedish) *Statistics Sweden, \\"Kommunfullmäktigval – erhållna mandat efter kommun och parti.

He was born in Hokendauqua, Pennsylvania, a village located within the boundaries of modern-day Whitehall, Pennsylvania (Lehigh County), and nearby to Allentown, Pennsylvania (its county seat). A 1942 graduate of Philadelphia’s Temple University, Tomasic was the captain of the 1941 football squad and was inducted into the school’s Hall of Fame in 1971. ==Sports career== Tomasic was drafted by the Pittsburgh Steelers in the 16th round of the 1942 NFL Draft. He was a halfback, defensive back, and return specialist. After making his NFL debut in 1942, Tomasic did not play from 1943 to 1945, as he served in the U.S. Army during World War II. Tomasic returned in 1946 in what would be his final NFL season. Just before retiring from the NFL, Tomasic had already begun his professional baseball career in the minor leagues (MiLB), with the Kinston Eagles (Kinston, North Carolina), of the Coastal Plain League. His many “farm circuit” successes earned him a big-league call-up, during the () MLB season. The New York Giants (NL) used Tomasic as a relief pitcher; over the 2 games in which he appeared, his win-loss record was 0-1, with 5 innings pitched, 10 earned runs allowed, striking out 2, while walking 5 batters. Tomasic batted and threw right-handed. Tomasic died on November 27, 2008, in Allentown, Pennsylvania. ==References*Andy Tomasic at Temple University Hall of Fame Category:1917 births Category:2008 deaths Category:American football halfbacks Category:Pittsburgh Steelers players Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:Baseball players from Pennsylvania Category:New York Giants (NL) players Category:Kinston Eagles players Category:Trenton Giants players Category:Jersey City Giants players Category:Minneapolis Millers (baseball) players Category:Ottawa Giants players Category:San Antonio Missions players Category:Charleston Senators players Category:United States Army soldiers Category:Temple Owls baseball players ","title":"Andy Tomasic"},{"id":"20522528","text":"Emergency Fire Response (a.k.a.

In this game, the player takes control of a team of firefighters from the fictional Fire Station 615. There are more than thirty missions within nine scenarios, each featuring different challenges which must be met with a range of different tactics. In this game, the player is able to take advantage of the individual talents of each member of his firefighting team. These include paramedics, High Risk Environment Specialists, and Technical Officers. Players can also use a number of different support vehicles, including ambulances and ladder trucks, to help complete missions. Players are also able to choose the appearance of their firefighting units based on the different appearances of firefighters in different parts of the world, but this does not change the overall experience of the game. ==Sequels== Two sequels have been made: Fire Department 2 (a.k.a.

A pet trust falls under trust law and is one option for pet owners who want to provide for their pets after they pass away. Alternatives include honorary bequests made through a will and contractual arrangements with the caregiver. Pet trusts stipulate that in the event of a grantor’s disability or death a trustee will hold property (cash, for example) “in trust” for the benefit of the grantor’s pets. The “grantor” (also called a settlor or trustor in some states) is the person who creates the trust, which may take effect during a person’s lifetime or at death. Payments to designated caregivers will be made on a regular basis. ==History== The development of pet trusts is part of the animal rights movement. ==United States== All U.S. states have passed laws that allow some form of pet trust. Some states allow a pet trust to continue for the life of the pet, without regard to a maximum duration of 21 years. This is particularly advantageous for companion animals who have longer life expectancies than cats and dogs, such as horses and parrots. ==See also== * Rachel Hirschfeld ==ReferencesExternal links== *\\"Providing For Your Pets In The Event of Your Death or Hospitalization\\".

The election was held on 21 September 1940. Earlier in 1940, the Lang Labor supporters had again broken away from the federal Australian Labor Party. Seats held by the defectors are designated as Labor seats. ==By-elections, appointments and defectionsBy-elections and appointments=== *On 12 July 1938, Jim Sheehan (Labor) was appointed a Victorian Senator to replace John Barnes (Labor). *On 10 December 1938, Sydney McHugh (Labor) was elected to succeed Charles Hawker (UAP) as the member for Wakefield. *On 20 May 1939, William Conelan (Labor) was elected to succeed Frank Baker (Labor) as the member for Griffith. *On 27 May 1939, Lancelot Spurr (Labor) was elected to succeed Joseph Lyons (UAP) as the member for Wilmot. *On 2 March 1940, John Dedman (Labor) was elected to succeed Richard Casey (UAP) as the member for Corio. *On 13 August 1940, three UAP cabinet ministers, Geoffrey Street (Corangamite), James Fairbairn (Flinders) and Sir Henry Gullett (Henty), were killed in the Canberra air disaster. No by- elections were held due to the proximity of the election. ===Defections=== *In 1937, Country Party MP John McEwen (Indi) was expelled from the state-based party for accepting a ministry in the Lyons-Page government. In response, following the party conference in 1938, Thomas Paterson (Gippsland) led over a hundred McEwen supporters out of the state United Country Party to form the breakaway Liberal Country Party, loyal to the Page-led federal party. The Country Party's other Victorian MP, George Rankin (Bendigo), remained with the UCP. *In 1938, Independent UAP MP Percy Spender (Warringah) joined the United Australia Party. *In 1940, supporters of New South Wales Premier Jack Lang again broke away from the federal Labor Party, this time calling themselves the Australian Labor Party (Non-Communist). Its federal members were Senator Stan Amour (New South Wales), Senator John Armstrong (New South Wales), Jack Beasley (West Sydney), Joe Gander (Reid), Dan Mulcahy (Lang), Sol Rosevear (Dalley) and Tom Sheehan (Cook). ==Retiring Members and SenatorsLabor=== * William Maloney MP (Melbourne, Vic) ===United Australia=== *Senator Charles Grant (Tas) ===Country=== * James Hunter MP (Maranoa, Qld) ==House of Representatives== Sitting members at the time of the election are shown in bold text.

In the same years he started applying elements of technical and industrial design to the field of arts, focusing on the relation between art and science and collaborating on several projects of kinetic and scientific art. As film director he directed several documentaries and three short movies before making his first feature film Sembra morto ma... è solo svenuto in 1986, written with Gianni Di Gregorio and Sergio Castellitto, who is also the protagonist. He spent many years directing motion pictures, developing a great interest both in film drama research and in the new expressive challenges coming from compositing images and sound in the new multi-layer virtual environments. His film Bidoni (1995) was the first Italian movie edited in Avid environment.

He later became a farmer, real estate speculator, historian and genealogist. ==Biography== Peirce was born in Assonet, Massachusetts to Ebenezer and Joanna (Weaver) Peirce. He attended local schools in Assonet and Andover Academy. He inherited an estate rich in real estate, and took up sheep farming.

Serving under Major General Benjamin F. Butler at Fort Monroe in Virginia, he was in direct command of the Union forces at the Battle of Big Bethel in June, 1861. This attempted assault on two nearby Confederate positions failed because it was too complex for the largely untrained unit, who inadvertently gave away their own position through a friendly fire incident. Peirce received most of the blame. On December 13, 1861, Peirce joined the volunteer forces as colonel of the 29th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment.Hunt, Roger D.

He was out of action until November 1862 when he returned to command his regiment and served in the siege of Knoxville. His regiment returned to Virginia with the rest of the IX Corps and fought at Cold Harbor. He commanded a brigade at the Second Battle of Petersburg. Peirce commanded a brigade during the following time periods: August 18-September 18, 1863; January 10-March 16, 1864; and, June 4-July 23, 1864. Peirce was discharged from the volunteer service on November 4, 1864 due to the loss of his right arm and general nervous debility relating to miasmatic diseases, and returned to Assonet. In 1880, he served one year as a member of the Freetown Board of Selectmen.

This doctrine is comparable to, but somewhat broader than, the doctrine of legal estoppel, assignor estoppel, or estoppel by deed in U.S. law. Under the doctrine of non-derogation from grants, a seller of realty or (after this decision) goods is not permitted to take any action (such as bringing an infringement action) that would lessen the value to the buyer of the thing sold. ==Background== Rear view of Leyland Marina showing exhaust pipe The factual context of the Leyland case was that British Leyland (BL), the owner of copyright in drawings of the exhaust pipe of a motor car (the Morris Marina) having sold or authorized the sale of the motor car, sought to use the law against copyright infringement to prevent the aftermarket sale of replacement exhaust pipes to purchasers of those motor cars. British Leyland's cars reproduced the drawings in a three dimensional form. Armstrong copied the exhaust pipes of BL's car and thus indirectly copied the drawings. BL sued Armstrong to enjoin the copying. ==Lower court rulings== BL were successful in the lower courts. The trial judge (Foster, J) and an intermediate appellate judge (Oliver, LJ) rejected Armstrong's concept of implied licence as applied to these exhaust pipes. Consequently, the trial court entered an injunction against Armstrong, which the Chancery Division of the High Court of Justice upheld. ==House of Lords' ruling== The House of Lords allowed the appeal, however, and discharged the injunctions granted by Foster, J; they remitted the cause back to the Chancery Division of the High Court of Justice \\"to do therein as shall be just and consistent with the Judgment of the House of Lords\\". The court considered the application of various possible legal doctrines—such as implied licence or \\"some form of estoppel\\"—but rejected them in favor of non-derogation. Lord Bridge observed: > It seems to me that when one is considering machinery which is not the > subject of any patent protection, it is unnecessary and may be misleading to > introduce the concept of an implied licence. The owner of a car must be > entitled to do whatever is necessary to keep it in running order and to > effect whatever repairs may be necessary in the most economical way > possible. To derive this entitlement from an implied licence granted by the > original manufacturer seems to me quite artificial. It is a right inherent > in the ownership of the car itself. There is an inconsistency between > marketing cars and thereby creating whatever rights attach to their > ownership on the one hand and acting to restrain the free exercise of those > rights on the other. The law does not countenance such inconsistencies. In his separate opinion, Lord Templeman pointed out that an implied licence might be negatived by express language, under principles of freedom of contract, but that was not so when non-derogation instead is involved: \\"The right cannot be withheld by the manufacturer of the car by contract with the first purchaser and cannot be withheld from any subsequent owner.\\" That is, the nature of property makes the right inherent and not a matter of freedom of contract. This case appears to be the first one extending the non-derogation doctrine from cases involving realty to cases involving personal property (chattels). Lord Templeman seems to have recognized this point in his opinion. After describing the operation of the principle in various types of case involving land, he stated: \\"I see no reason why the principle that a grantor will not be allowed to derogate from his grant [of land] by using property retained by him in such a way as to render property granted by him unfit or materially unfit for the purpose for which the grant was made should not apply to the sale of a car.\\" This decision also re-affirmed the ruling in LB (Plastics) Ltd. v. Swish Products Ltd.,[1979] R.P.C. 551, [1979] F.S.R. 145 (H.L.), edited version available at Swish. stating that the rule of the Swish decision must now be regarded as \\"settled law\\" (that is, that under UK copyright law a physical object is an infringing copy of a technical drawing depicting the object) in a manner recognizable to an ordinary person. ==Subsequent developmentsGreen Cartridge case=== In Canon Kabushiki Kaisha v Green Cartridge Co,[1997 UKPC 19 (30 April 1997), [1997] 3 WLR 13, [1997] AC 728, [1997] FSR 817. the Privy Council considered the scope of the spare parts exception recognised by the House of Lords in the British Leyland case, in an appeal from the Court of Appeal of Hong Kong. Canon sold laser printers and copiers that consumed toner cartridges. GC went into the business of manufacturing and selling replacement toner cartridges for Canon machines. In the courts of Hong Kong it was accepted, in view of the decision of the House of Lords in the British Leyland case, that the manufacture of the parts by the defendant by reverse engineering from Canon's parts was an indirect reproduction in three-dimensional form of the drawings from which the parts had been made, and therefore a copyright infringement unless excused by the spare parts rule of the Leyland case. The Hong Kong trial court thought the Leyland doctrine inapplicable but the Court of Appeal reversed, holding it applicable. The Privy Council did not accept the applicability of concepts of implied licence, non-derogation from grant, or inalienable right to repair one's property as bases for the Leyland spare parts doctrine. Instead the Privy Council said the doctrine was \\"an expression of what the House perceived as overriding public policy, namely the need to prevent a manufacturer from using copyright (as opposed to patents or design right) in order to control the aftermarket in spare parts.\\" The Privy Council then turned to what in the United States has been considered the \\"Chicago School\\" method of legal analysis: > The question of whether it is contrary to the public interest for a > manufacturer to be able to exercise monopoly control over his aftermarket > cannot usually be answered without some inquiry into the relevant market. > For example, if customers are in a position to reckon the lifetime cost of > one product (including purchases such as cartridges which will have to be > made in the aftermarket) as against the lifetime cost of a competing > product, then control of the aftermarket will not be anticompetitive. A > manufacturer who charges too much for his cartridges will sell less of his > machines. The figures which their Lordships have already quoted for > expenditure on the machine itself and on cartridges make it likely that > purchasers with any degree of sophistication will be comparing machines on a > lifetime cost basis. The court said it thus found the question too complicated to be solved by broad generalisation. Moreover, \\"once one departs from the case in which the unfairness to the customer and the anticompetitive nature of the monopoly is as plain and obvious as it appeared to the House of Lords in British Leyland, the jurisprudential and economic basis for the doctrine becomes extremely fragile.\\" The Privy Council did not perceive in this case \\"the features of unfairness and abuse of monopoly power which underlay the decision in British Leyland\\" as \\"plainly and obviously present.\\" Therefore, they reversed the order of the Court of Appeal on the copyright issue and reinstated that of the trial court. ===Mars v Teknowledge=== In Mars U.K. Ltd. v. Teknowledge Ltd.,Mars, [2000] F.S.R. 138. the High Court of Justice, Chancery Division, considered the non-derogation doctrine set forth in the British Leyland case, in the wake and light of the Green Cartridge case. Mr. Justice Jacob interpreted Green Cartridge as holding that the British Leyland \\"spare parts exception applied\\" only when it was \\"plain and obvious\\" that the challenged act of replacement (here, altering the software) was analogous to a repair which an ordinary purchaser of an article would assume he could do for himself without infringing the manufacturer’s rights, or that \\"the exercise of monopoly power by means of copyright would be against consumers’ interests.\\" The court held that the circumstances of the Mars case—altering a coin changer so that it would operate for UK coinage by altering the software—did not warrant invocation of the non-derogation doctrine. The court brushed aside Teknowledge's public policy arguments: \\"I therefore conclude that there is no overwhelming public policy reason entitling those who purchase machines [for changing coins] to use Mars copyright and database rights to convert those machines for new coins.\\"A perhaps contrary result was reached in the US Supreme Court decision in Wilbur-Ellis Co. v. Kuther, 377 U.S. 422 (1964). In that case, the US court considered making functional improvements in a purchased machine, albeit a patented one, was \\"akin\\" to repair and thus part of the property rights of the owner/purchaser. In that case, the property owner modified a fish-canning machine to use different size cans. ===Dyson v Qualtex=== In Dyson Ltd v Qualtext (UK) Ltd,[2006] RPC 31, [2006] EWCA Civ 166. the Court of Appeal, in an opinion written by Lord Justice Jacob, rejected the appeal of a manufacturer and distributor of vacuum cleaner parts from a High Court judgment against it in a case brought by the vacuum cleaner manufacturer. Dyson sued Qualtex for copyright and unregistered design right infringement for creating and selling deliberate imitations of Dyson's original vacuum cleaner parts. In 1988 Parliament supplemented the doctrine of the 1986 Leyland case with legislationSection 213 of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988. In addition section 51 of the CDPA provided what Lord Justice Jacob termed \\"perhaps more principled solution\\" to address the problem that arose in the Leyland case—that a \\"manufacturer whose product would not qualify for copyright protection because it fell outside the definition of 'artistic work' might nonetheless be able to control the market through the artistic copyright in any drawings of the design\\". The statute provided that, \\"except where the design was one for an artistic work, the use of the design to make what is illustrated is not an infringement\\". [www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2009/1328.html Lucasfilm Ltd v Ainsworth], [2009] EWCA Civ 1328, [2010] ECDR 6, [2010] Ch 503, [2010] 3 WLR 333, (2010) 33(4) IPD 33021, [2010] 1 Ch 503. providing two specific new exceptions, known as \\"must fit\\" and \\"must match\\"—meaning that spare parts could be made that corresponded to the configuration of the original product (as the exhaust pipe in the Leyland case, for example, bent and twisted to fit the pattern of the underside of the Morris Marina car) and they could be designed to correspond to the appearance of the original product in which the spare part is \\"to form an integral part\\" (for example, the right fender of a car must not be dissimilar in aesthetic appearance to the left fender). Qualtex sought to defend under \\"must fit\\" and \\"must match\\" but the court rejected this defence. As he did in the Mars case, Justice Jacob construed the spare parts dealer's defences narrowly. As for Leyland, he said that the Green Cartridge case held that \\"the Leyland defence is limited to clear cases of anti-competitiveness, or those where the ordinary man would 'unquestionably assume that he could do for himself (or commission someone else to do)' \\". He interpreted the 1988 legislation as a compromise between the interests of original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and spare parts manufacturers—\\"on the one hand Parliament refused to create a general spare parts exception, and on the other hand clearly did not intend that OEMs should have absolute control over the manufacture of spares\\". (He did not refer to the interests of the general public.) He interpreted the statute to require this rule (as stated in the High Court judgment): > But unless the spare parts dealer can show that as a practical matter there > is a real need to copy a feature of shape or configuration because of some > design consideration of the whole article, he is not within the exclusion. > It is not enough to assert that the public \\"prefers\\" an exact copy . . . . > In the absence of solid and reasoned evidence (which in the circumstances > would have had to have been opinion evidence) I do not think it is possible > to say that no-one would buy a non-replica handle, and I would be a little > sceptical of assertions to that effect. It is conceivable they might, if > there were a price differential which made it worthwhile. . . . A Dyson > vacuum cleaner may well be purchased at least in part because of its design, > but I would require some evidence were it to be said that the design > preference of the customer for this piece of household utilitarianism would > lead the customer to require it to keep its looks after a repair in the same > way as a car is required to keep its looks. This is, I accept, somewhat > speculative in the absence of solid evidence, but it is plausible and I > certainly cannot find that that is wrong and Qualtex has not discharged its > burden of showing it is right. In denying Qualtex's appeal, the court concluded: > The overall lesson here is that the exceptions to UDR created by the Act do > not give a carte blanche for pattern spares. Those who wish to make spares > during the period of design right must design their own spares and cannot > just copy every detail of the OEM's part. To be on the safe side they will > have to make them different as far as is possible—for trying to navigate by > the chart provided by this crude statute is a risky business. == References == Category:House of Lords cases Category:1986 in case law Category:1986 in British law Category:Copyright case law Category:British Leyland ","title":"British Leyland Motor Corp v Armstrong Patents Co"},{"id":"20522644","text":"Dalaqo is a village in the municipality of Güləzi in the Quba Rayon of Azerbaijan. ==References== Category:Populated places in Quba District (Azerbaijan) ","title":"Dalaqo"},{"id":"20522649","text":"Xanagahyolu (also, Xanagah yolu) is a village in the municipality of Güləzi in the Quba Rayon of Azerbaijan. ==References== Category:Populated places in Quba District (Azerbaijan) ","title":"Xanagahyolu"},{"id":"20522657","text":"The Jardin Exotique de Roscoff (1.6 hectares) is a botanical garden located in Roscoff, Finistère, in the region of Brittany, France.

Tapken (21 February 1913 – June 1996) was an English footballer whose regular position was as a goalkeeper. Born in Wallsend, Northumberland, he began his career with local club Wallsend Thermal Welfare, before joining Newcastle United in May 1933.Dykes (1994), p. 367. After taking over from Mick Burns as Newcastle's first-choice goalkeeper during the 1934–35 season, he went on to make a total of 106 appearances for Newcastle before joining Manchester United in December 1938 for a fee of £850. Taking over from regular goalkeeper Jack Breedon, Tapken made his debut for the club at home to Leicester City on Boxing Day 1938; he kept a clean sheet as Manchester United won 3–0. He retained the number one jersey for the next two months, but a run of four games at the end of February 1939 in which he conceded 16 goals saw Tommy Breen take over. Tapken returned to duty for three games at the start of April, but a 3–1 defeat to Leeds United resulted in Breedon step in again for the final four games of the season. During the Second World War, Tapken played in the Wartime League for his old club, Newcastle United (nine appearances),Rollin (2005), p. 375. and Sunderland (two appearances) in 1942–43,Rollin (2005), p. 420. before finding more regular action with Darlington (32 appearances) in 1943–44.Rollin (2005), pp. 324–5. In 1944–45, as well as playing for Darlington (six appearances), he turned out for Aldershot (three appearances),Rollin (2005), p. 268. Brighton & Hove Albion (two appearances)Rollin (2005), p. 293. and Chester (one appearance).Rollin (2005), p. 311. He played one more season in the Wartime League with Darlington (six appearances), before returning to play 12 matches for Manchester United.Rollin (2005), p. 365. However, with the resumption of The Football League in August 1946, Tapken – now 34 years old – was unable to regain his place in the Manchester United first team, and in April 1947, he moved to Darlington on a permanent basis. He missed just 11 games in the 1947–48 season, but his performances could not help Darlington to any higher than 16th place in the Third Division North. At the end of the season, he joined Irish club Shelbourne, where he spent one season before retiring from the game; it turned out to be his most successful season as a professional, as the team won the League of Ireland Shield, the Leinster Cup and finished as runners-up in the League of Ireland and the FAI Cup, while Tapken himself was selected for two League of Ireland XI matches against the Irish Football League (Northern Ireland). In July 1952, Tapken took up an assistant trainer role with Stoke City. ==References== ;General * * ;Specific ==External links== *Profile at StretfordEnd.co.uk Category:1913 births Category:1996 deaths Category:English footballers Category:Newcastle United F.C. players Category:Manchester United F.C. players Category:Darlington F.C. players Category:Shelbourne F.C. players Category:Newcastle United F.C. wartime guest players Category:Sunderland A.F.C. wartime guest players Category:Darlington F.C. wartime guest players Category:Aldershot F.C. wartime guest players Category:Brighton & Hove Albion F.C. wartime guest players Category:Chester City F.C. wartime guest players Category:Association football goalkeepers ","title":"Norman Tapken"},{"id":"20522731","text":"I'm Back may refer to: * I'm Back (album), a 1998 album by James Brown * I'm Back (film), a 2018 comedy directed by Luca Miniero * \\"I'm Back\\", a song by Eminem from his album The Marshall Mathers LP * \\"I'm Back\\" (song), a 2010 song by American rapper T.I. * \\"I'm Back\\", a song by Monica from her album All Eyez on Me * \\"I'm Back\\", a song by Ashley Tisdale from her album Guilty Pleasure * \\"I'm Back\\", a song by Slim Thug from his album Boss of All Bosses * \\"I'm Back\\", a song by The Box (1987) * \\"I'm Back\\", a song by The Charmers (1964) * \\"I'm Back\\", a song by Karrier (1984) * \\"I'm Back\\", a song by Little Richard (1966) * \\"I'm Back\\", a song by Sil Austin And His Orchestra (1958) * \\"I'm Back\\", a song by Tommy Faia And The True Blue Facts (1968) * \\"I'm Back\\", a song by Ile Kallio (1982) * \\"I'm back\\", a variant of the Terminator's \\"I'll be back\\" phrase ==See also== *We're Back!

Handel then used the tune for the aria \\"Lascia la spina, cogli la rosa\\", or \\"Leave the Thorn, Take the Rose\\", for the character Piacere in part 2 of his 1707 oratorio Il trionfo del Tempo e del Disinganno (which was much later, in 1737, revised as Il trionfo del Tempo e della Verità).http://imslp.org/wiki/File:PMLP44532-HG_Band_24.pdf Four years after that, in 1711, Handel used the music again, this time for his London opera Rinaldo and its act 2 aria \\"Lascia ch'io pianga\\" (\\"Let me weep\\"), a heartfelt plea for her liberty addressed by the character Almirena to her abductor Argante. Rinaldo was a triumph, and it is with this work that the aria is chiefly associated. ==Music== Handel wrote the aria in the key of F major with a time signature of and a tempo marking of Largo. In the first edition published by John Walsh, the orchestration is unspecified,The songs in Rinaldo, first edition giving only a solo melody line above an unfigured bass line. There is the mention 'violins' at bar 23 where the singer breaks (bar 31 in most modern editions which include an 8-bar introduction). Chrysander claimedhttp://imslp.org/wiki/File:PMLP44810-HG_Band_58a.pdf to have worked from Handel's 'performance score' and stated that the autograph manuscript had been lost (although RISM state that the British Library hold a fragment of the autograph missing 53 bars);https://opac.rism.info/search?id=800238134 Chrysander's edition shows two violins and a viola with a cello. He does not provide figuring for the continuo. It is not clear whether he invented the additional string parts himself (as he often did) or found them in the performance score to which he referred. Most modern editions seem to be based upon Chrysander's version, as can be seen from the different placement of certain syllables in the melismata in his version and in the Walsh first edition. A performance takes about five minutes. The aria has been recorded by many artists, and is featured in several films including Farinelli; All Things Fair by Bo Widerberg;Lærerinden – Musikstycken (in Swedish). Swedish Film Institute. Retrieved on 28 July 2008. L.I.E. by Michael Cuesta; AntichristAntichrist Pressbook (PDF). Artificial Eye. Retrieved on 28 July 2009. and Nymphomaniac, both by Lars von Trier. ==Libretto== Cardinal Benedetto Pamphili's text and lyrics for the 1707 version of the aria are: Lascia la spina, cogli la rosa; tu vai cercando il tuo dolor. Canuta brina per mano ascosa, giungerà quando nol crede il cuor. Leave the thorn, pluck the rose; you go searching for your pain. Hoary frost by hidden hand will come when your heart doesn't expect it. Handel's 1739 pasticcio Giove in Argo also has a \\"Lascia la spina\\" aria, but a shorter one, less known, and set to a different melody. The libretto for Rinaldo was written by Giacomo Rossi from a scenario provided by Aaron Hill. Almirena is addressing the Saracen king of Jerusalem, Argante, who is holding her prisoner and has just disclosed his passion at first sight for her.The following is the original text by Aaron Hill (from the booklet annexed to Jean-Claude Malgoire's first full recording of Rinaldo, released by CBS in 1977): Permit the wretched to complain Of their unhappy fate; The loss of liberty's a pain That should our sights create. When you wou'd comfort an afflicted mind, Pity, not love, shou'd make you kind. Lascia ch'io pianga mia cruda sorte, e che sospiri la libertà. Il duolo infranga queste ritorte, de' miei martiri sol per pietà. Let me weep over my cruel fate, and let me sigh for liberty. May sorrow shatter these chains, for my torments just out of pity. ==NotesReferencesBibliography== * ==External links== * *, Sandrine Piau with the Akademie für Alte Musik Berlin, conducting Category:Arias by George Frideric Handel Category:Opera excerpts Category:Compositions in F major Category:1705 compositions Category:Soprano arias ","title":"Lascia ch'io pianga"},{"id":"20522786","text":"Arminidae is a family of sea slugs, marine gastropod mollusks in the superfamily Arminoidea. == Taxonomy == The family Arminidae is classified within the clade Cladobranchia, itself belonging to the clade Nudibranchia (according to the taxonomy of the Gastropoda by Bouchet & Rocroi, 2005).

The dark red fruit is firm and large, sometimes measuring more than one inch in diameter. Its fruit has a strong resistance to cracking brought about by pre- harvest rains, and the trees growing the Ulster cherry have been documented as showing a higher resistance to southwest trunk winter injury, cherry leaf spot and the late spring frosts that can prove fatal to this cultivar . Cracking can be high on some young trees, but the level of cracking declines as the trees mature.“Dark Sweet Cherry Varieties,” Michigan Agricultural Experiment Station, January 1999 ==Usage== The 'Ulster' cherry’s sweet taste has made it popular in several formats. It can be consumed as freshly picked fruit, and it is also used in canned cherries products.Saveur “A Cherry Gallery,” Saveur Magazine It has also been incorporated into wine production.

The story was written by Donald Glover, DC Pierson, Dominic Dierkes, Dan Eckman and Meggie McFadden. It stars Glover, Pierson and Dierkes, was directed by Eckman and produced by McFadden. It also marked the feature film debuts for Aubrey Plaza, Ellie Kemper, Neil Casey, Ben Schwartz and Bobby Moynihan. After premiering at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival, it was released in the United States on August 28, 2009. ==Plot== The Mystery Team consisting of \\"Master of Disguise\\" Jason Rogers (Donald Glover), \\"Boy Genius\\" Duncan Wheeler (DC Pierson), and the \\"Strongest Kid in town\\" Charlie Day (Dominic Dierkes) began with three children who styled themselves as detectives, solving mostly kid-related mysteries such as missing cats or a lost baseball, but also gaining some local fame. The trio have remained as naïve as ever, although they are about to graduate from high school. They have continued the same mindset and antics even though they are teenagers, focusing on children's infractions, although adults (such as their parents) wonder when the teens will grow out of this attitude. To prove to themselves and the town at large that they can be \\"real detectives\\", the Mystery Team take it upon themselves to solve a double homicide when they are hired by a young girl named Brianna (Daphne Ciccarelle) to discover why her parents were killed. Although Duncan and Charlie are reluctant to help her, Jason convinces them to help her, stating that it is their chance to prove they can be real detectives and earn everyone's respect. Then they meet Brianna's older sister Kelly (Aubrey Plaza), whom Jason becomes attracted to, who tells them to let the cops handle it. They ignore her, and go to the local grocery store, where they are told by their friend Jordy (Bobby Moynihan) that a hobo named Sam may know something. They are given stuff from Kelly's house from Sam and find a card from a local bowling alley with a symbol engraved in it. They go to the bowling alley where they meet a clerk, who has a grudge against them and refuses to scan the card. However, they spot a guy named Dougie, who the card belongs to, and see that he's wearing Kelly's ring. They follow Dougie to a local gentlemen's club where the bouncer attempts to throw them out for spying on Dougie and a stripper with him. However, they escape from the bouncer and Duncan and Charlie overhear Dougie saying that someone named Leroy gave him Kelly's ring and the ring is now in the stripper's vagina. Jason, Duncan and Charlie then retrieve the ring from the toilet the stripper urinated it into and escape from the gentlemen's club before the bouncer catches them. After returning the ring to Kelly, they go back to Jordy, who tells them about Dougie and who Leroy is. Leroy Maddox (Peter Saati) is a dangerous drug dealer who used to work at the local lumber yard. After learning his address at the lumber yard, they go to his house claiming to want to buy drugs from him. Jason sneaks away and hears Leroy arguing with someone on the phone about finding some papers. After going to Kelly's house to find the papers, he finds Kelly and they both find a paper that states something called Iphedolene is extremely toxic. However, Leroy, who becomes suspicious of Duncan and Charlie, shows up at Kelly's house and takes them hostage but they manage to escape. After Kelly thanks Jason, who promises to tell everything to the police, he, Duncan and Charlie return to the lumber yard, where they find Leroy and his girlfriend's dead bodies. A horrified Duncan then decides to give up, despite Jason's objections. He and Charlie then reveal to Jason that they are going to college and leaving him, as he didn't apply. After a fed up Duncan and Jason get into a fight, he and Charlie abandon Jason. After going to talk to Kelly and Brianna, their dad's friend Robert Finney (Glenn Kalison), who they have been staying with since their parents' death, helps fix his damaged bike. However, Jason realizes that Robert was the one he heard arguing with Leroy on the phone and quickly leaves. After going to a police officer, who tells Jason he needs proof to believe him, he goes to the Holden and Charles Corporation, where Robert works and Kelly's father worked, but not before attempting to warn Kelly about Robert on a walkie-talkie he gave her, not knowing that Robert has it. At Holden and Charles, Jason bonds with two employees Jim and Frank, who get him drunk and give advice on asking Kelly out. After sneaking into Robert's office, Jason learns that Robert is trying to treat wood with the toxic substance Iphedolene. Kelly's father, who was a lawyer, learned this and was going to ruin the company and Robert, which is the reason Robert hired Leroy to scare him, not kill him. When Leroy kept asking for money, he killed him too. Duncan and Charlie, who heard Jason talking about Robert on a walkie- talkie, also show up to help him. The three are then confronted by Robert, but they manage to escape. After Jason makes up with Duncan and Charlie, Robert, who has taken Kelly hostage, uses the walkie-talkie to contact them into bringing the papers to the lumber yard. After they give him the papers, Robert holds them at gunpoint to kill them. When Jason tries to reason with Robert, he shoots him, but Charlie attacks him allowing the others escape. When Jason, who admits his feelings for Kelly and kisses her, finds a firecracker Jordy gave to him earlier, he gives it to Duncan, who lights it and shoots it at Robert with his slingshot, severely damaging his face. When the police show up, Robert is presumely arrested for his crimes and Jason has his wound tended to (off screen). Months later, Jason is recovering from his gunshot wound, and has a job in medical technologies. His parents have adopted Brianna while Kelly is at Dartmouth College, but is still together with Jason. After Jason says goodbye to a departing Duncan and Charlie, a man comes out of the woods needing help. The film ends with the guys getting ready for another mystery in excitement while the man shouts in anguish. ==Cast== * Donald Glover as Jason Rogers * DC Pierson as Duncan Wheeler * Dominic Dierkes as Charlie Day * Aubrey Plaza as Kelly Peters * Glenn Kalison as Robert Finney * Peter Saati as Leroy Maddox * Ellie Kemper as Jamie * Matt Walsh as Jim * Bobby Moynihan as Jordy * Daphne Ciccarelle as Brianna Peters * John Lutz as Frank * Jon Daly as Greg Coleman * Neil Casey as Broken Man ==Production== In January 2008, Derrick Comedy took a hiatus from filming short online sketch videos to produce Mystery Team, which is the group's first feature-length production. The film was independently produced and shot over seven weeks in the Spring of 2008. It was shot on the Red camera. Mystery Team was filmed primarily in Manchester, New Hampshire, Eckman and McFadden's hometown. Marks Showplace, a real-life strip club in Bedford, New Hampshire, was used as Ponytail's Gentlemen's Club in the movie. The Lumber Yard scenes were filmed on location at Reeds Ferry Lumber Corp. Merrimack, NH. The movie was shot on a tight budget. The budget for the film came from their Youtube video sketches and producing online commercials for Clearasil. Dominic Dierkes mentioned on the DVD commentary and on tour stops that lighting problems forced a wardrobe change for his character. Dierkes said his initially white shirt reflected light that appeared to glow when viewed on screen. With several early \\"white shirt\\" scenes already shot, and not having the budget to reshoot them, the members of Derrick opted to write in a gag in which Dierkes spilled chocolate milk and used the shirt as a rag, forcing him to switch to a red shirt for the remainder of the movie. ==Release== Mystery Team premiered at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival as part of the Park City at Midnight series and was then released by Roadside Attractions in select cinemas on September 11 and 18, 2009. After a high frequency of demands on eventful.com, the film received additional theater engagements throughout the fall, including one starting in New York City on December 4. A private screening was also arranged for employees at Pixar. The film grossed $89,442 in the United States. The film had its UK premiere in February 2012 at the Teenage Wasteland festival organised by Ultra Culture. To promote the film, the group released a new online digital short starring the central characters, entitled Mystery Team Adventures: The Case of the Haunted Hotel. ===Home media=== The film was released on DVD on May 25, 2010. ==Reception== On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 58% based on 19 reviews, and an average rating of 5.4/10.

Jim Fiala is a St. Louis area native, who grew up in the suburbs of Crestwood, Sunset Hills and unincorporated West County. He is a 1983 graduate of Parkway West High School. (He is a 2014 inductee into the Parkway Alumni Hall of Fame.) He has a degree in Finance from Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas. Fiala’s parents introduced him to fine dining at an early age. For his 13th birthday he was taken to dinner at St. Louis’ most elite restaurant, Tony’s. When the family traveled to New York or Los Angeles, they always dined at the places that were highly rated in the Michelin guide. [1] ==Early Training== Upon graduation from S.M.U., Fiala worked briefly in the Dallas area for an agency that promoted professional wrestling in Texas. In early 1988, he joined Clipper Cruise Lines as a deckhand. When an opening occurred in the kitchen, he took the job and began his career in cooking. He says “I got stuck in the galley for seven weeks and fell in love with cooking.” [2] In late 1989, Fiala returned to St. Louis and worked for just over a year preparing food for Catering St. Louis. Fiala enrolled in the California Culinary Academy in San Francisco at the beginning of 1991. During his time in the Bay Area he worked for chef Jeremiah Trotter at Stars restaurant and for chef Patricia Unterman at Hayes Street Grill. == Chicago and New York == Upon graduation from California Culinary Academy in November, 1992, Jim Fiala returned to the Midwest and accepted a job offer from Chicago’s Spiaggia restaurant in the Gold Coast area. He started at $6.50/hour and performed every aspect of kitchen work. [3] In 1994, Paul Bartolotta of Spiaggia called Daniel Boulud, owner of Restaurant Daniel in New York City, and asked if he needed staff. Boulud said yes and asked about Fiala “Can he handle the pressure?” Bartolotta assured him that Fiala was ready for the move to the Big Apple. Fiala’s kitchen jobs in New York included “entrimitier” (vegetable cook) and “poussioniere” (fish cook). He also, for a time, made all the restaurant’s pasta. During his tenure there, Restaurant Daniel earned its New York Times four star rating. [4] Following his time in New York City, Jim Fiala was recruited to cook at the Horned Dorsett Primavera resort in Puerto Rico. == Return to St. Louis == In late 1997, Fiala came back to St. Louis. On April 15, 1998, with then business partner Cary McDowell, Fiala opened The Crossing (7823 Forsyth Boulevard) in Clayton. The name of the restaurant represented a “crossing” of Italian and French influences. The restaurant received several positive reviews early on and has enjoyed strong popularity as a leader of the “new breed” of fine dining establishments in metro St. Louis. [5] R.W. Apple Jr. wrote about The Crossing in the New York Times: “Two chefs from Daniel in New York have set St. Louis on its conservative ear with this stylish bilevel establishment. A piece of poached skate that all but melted into a pile of mashed potatoes, formed the centerpiece of a satisfying meal that began with roasted beets and goat cheese and ended with perfectly simple, simply perfect vanilla ice cream.” [6] Patricia Corrigan of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch named The Crossing 1998’s Best New Restaurant and called The Crossing’s Beef Tenderloin the year’s best Beef Entrée. [7] Joe Bonwich, then writing for the Riverfront Times, said of The Crossing: “The result is a truly unique and innovative style for St. Louis and we should all be hopeful that Fiala’s youthful wanderlust has worn off and that he’s come back to stay.” He added: “This place certainly aspires to a national reputation.” [8] John Garganigo of the Ladue News wrote: “In a short period of three months it (The Crossing) has become the darling of local movers and shakers.” [9] As The Crossing grew into its position as an upscale, more formal, fine dining destination, Fiala and his partner sought to establish a more casual version of The Crossing in the Central West End. Liluma opened in 2002 and had a successful run until its closing in December, 2012. == Acero == Jim Fiala’s Italian restaurant is Acero in suburban Maplewood, Missouri (7266 Manchester Road). Acero’s opening on March 2, 2007, was followed by an overwhelming number of positive reviews. In a city famous for Italian restaurants, Acero stands out. Acero is distinctive because it features the regional cuisine of Tuscany and Emilia Romagna in Northern Italy. Acero is the Italian word for maple. Acero was featured in 2008 in the annual Restaurant issue of Bon Appetit magazine. “The Best Italian Food in America” were the words on the cover of the issue (September, 2008). [11] Inside the magazine was a feature that included recipes from twelve different restaurants in the U.S. Acero’s contribution was its cauliflower ravioli with guanciale. Acero was the only St. Louis restaurant included. [12] Fiala’s concept for Acero is “artisan.” He says “I want Acero to be recognized as an ‘artisan’ restaurant, a place that embraces the Italian artisans, the guys who…have elevated our palates and now our expectations.” [13] ==Personal Philosophy== Jim Fiala is a “hands on” owner who spends time at each of his restaurants daily. His top priority is quality control. His mission: “We work on improving everyday.” He has told his employees that their goal should be to make “every meal a great meal.” [14] Jim Fiala visited Italy in February, 2009. While dining at a restaurant in the state of Abruzzo, Jim met a man named Luigi Cataldi Madonna. Jim says that Luigi summarized Jim's own cooking philosophy in these few words: \\"Find the complexity in the simple.\\" Fiala also visited Italy in 2011. Jim Fiala is married and has three children. ==References== [1,3] St. Louis Business Journal, March 23–29, 2001, “Three Years and Counting.” [2] St. Louis Post- Dispatch, March 20, 1999, “Set Sail for a Dining Adventure.” [4] New York Times, November 11, 1994, “Restaurants.” (Review of Restaurant Daniel.)

It was the Crimson Tide's 115th overall season, 76th season as a member of the Southeastern Conference (SEC) and its 18th within the SEC Western Division. The team was led by head coach Nick Saban, in his third year, and played their home games at Bryant–Denny Stadium in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. They finished the season undefeated with a record of 14–0 (8–0 in the SEC) and as national champions. Looking to build on the successes of the 2008 campaign, Alabama entered the 2009 season as the favorite to win the Western Division and meet the Florida Gators in the 2009 SEC Championship Game. Alabama closed the regular season with a 12–0 record including four wins against Top 25-ranked teams—and met the Gators for the SEC Championship in a rematch of the 2008 contest. Alabama was victorious by a final score of 32–13. The following day, final Bowl Championship Series (BCS) standings were unveiled. No. 1 ranked Alabama would meet No. 2 ranked Texas for the BCS National Championship. In the BCS National Championship Game, the Crimson Tide defeated the Longhorns 37–21 to capture their first-ever BCS Championship. With the 14-0 record, they became only the 2nd team in college football history to accomplish this feat, behind the 2002 Buckeyes. Alabama earned their third SEC championship since the inception of the SEC Championship Game in 1992, and their 22nd SEC title. The victory over Texas gave Alabama their 13th national championship in football (their eighth wire service title since the AP Poll began in 1936) and their ninth perfect season since 1925. The season included victories over the previous three national champions: Florida, Louisiana State University (LSU), and Texas. The season marked the first time a player for Alabama won the Heisman Trophy: Mark Ingram won the award over Stanford running back Toby Gerhart. Other award winners included Rolando McClain, who won the Butkus Award and the Jack Lambert Award, and defensive coordinator Kirby Smart, who won the Broyles Award as the nation's top assistant coach. Also, six players were named to various All-America Teams with Terrence Cody, Mike Johnson, and Javier Arenas being consensus selections and Ingram and McClain each being unanimous selections. ==Before the season== During the 2008–2009 campaign, the Crimson Tide completed a perfect 12–0 regular season record with wins over No. 9 Clemson, No. 3 Georgia, longtime rival Tennessee, No. 16 LSU, and in-state rival Auburn to end a six-game losing streak in the Iron Bowl. The Tide went on to lose their final two games in the postseason to end the season 12–2. They lost to the Florida Gators (31–20) in the SEC Championship Game, and to the Utah Utes (31–17) in the Sugar Bowl. Alabama reached No. 1 in the AP and Coaches' Polls for the first time since the final polls in 1992 and during the regular season for the first time since 1980 between weeks ten and fourteen. The Tide reached No. 1 in the BCS rankings for the first time in school history between weeks ten and fourteen. The team finished the 2008 season with a final ranking of No. 6 in both the AP and Coaches' Polls. In February 2009, Alabama signed the No. 1 recruiting class according to Rivals and the No. 2 recruiting class according to Scout. Spring practice began on March 13 and concluded with the annual A-Day game on April 18. Televised live by ESPN, the Crimson team defeated the White team by a score of 14–7 before 84,050 fans in Bryant–Denny Stadium. Greg McElroy and Marquis Maze were named co-MVPs of the game. On June 11, 2009, the NCAA Committee on Infractions sanctioned Alabama for \\"major violations\\" of NCAA policies as a result of athletes who received improper benefits in 16 of 19 NCAA sports, including football. As a penalty, the football program was forced to vacate 21 victories from the 2005, 2006, and 2007 seasons in addition to being placed on three years probation, ending in June 2012. The university stated that none of the textbooks or materials identified in the investigation were used for profit, and that the athletes involved who still had eligibility remaining were to pay restitution for the additional materials identified as part of the inquiry. Alabama appealed the ruling to the NCAA Infractions Appeals Committee in late June, but was unsuccessful; the Committee upheld the sanctions in March 2010. During SEC Media Days in July, voters selected Alabama and Florida to again win their divisions, with 63 of 64 ballots choosing Florida to win the SEC Championship Game. Voters selected Julio Jones, Mike Johnson, Terrence Cody, Rolando McClain, Javier Arenas (as a defensive back), and Leigh Tiffin to the Preseason All-SEC First Team and selected Mark Ingram and Arenas (as a return specialist) to the Preseason All-SEC Second Team. By August, Alabama had 19 players on 11 different preseason award watch lists. These included Cody and McClain for the Chuck Bednarik Award; Jones for the Fred Biletnikoff Award; Dont’a Hightower and McClain for the Butkus Award; Leigh Tiffin for the Lou Groza Award; Cody, Hightower, Mike Johnson, and McClain for the Lombardi Award; Cody and McClain for the Lott Trophy; Jones for the Maxwell Award; Javier Arenas, Cody, and McClain for the Bronko Nagurski Trophy; Cody and Johnson for the Outland Trophy; Arenas for the Jim Thorpe Award; and Mark Ingram for the Doak Walker Award. ===Returning starters=== Alabama had 16 returning starters from the previous season, including eight on defense, four on offense, and all of the special teams. The most notable departures from the previous year were Andre Smith, Antoine Caldwell, and Marlon Davis on the offensive line; John Parker Wilson at quarterback; Glen Coffee at running back; and Rashad Johnson at safety.

Alabama signed the No. 1 recruiting class according to Rivals and the No. 2 recruiting class according to Scout. The football program received 29 letters of intent on National Signing Day, February 4, 2009. ==Schedule== The Sagarin computer ratings calculated Alabama's strength of schedule to be the most difficult out of the 245 Division I teams. The Congrove Computer Rankings also calculated it as the most difficult out of the 120 Division I FBS teams in its rankings. Alabama's 2009 schedule was officially released on December 19, 2008. In accordance with conference rules, Alabama faced all five Western Division opponents: Arkansas, Auburn, LSU, Mississippi State, and Ole Miss. They also faced three Eastern Division opponents: official SEC rival Tennessee, Kentucky, and South Carolina. Alabama did not play SEC opponents Georgia and Vanderbilt. Although not on the regular season schedule, Bama met Florida in the SEC Championship Game. Alabama also played five non-conference games. For the season opener, the Tide played in the Chick-fil-A Kickoff Game against Virginia Tech at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta. The non-conference schedule also included games against Florida International and North Texas of the Sun Belt Conference and UT-Chattanooga of the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS). For the 2010 BCS National Championship Game, Alabama played Texas for the first time since the 1982 Cotton Bowl Classic. :Source: Rolltide.com All-time Football Results: 2009 Season ==RosterDepth chart== Starters and backups. ==Coaching staff== Prior to the 2009 season, Alabama made several changes to its coaching staff. Alabama lost their defensive head coach, Kevin Steele, on January 10, 2009, when he was hired as defensive coordinator for Clemson, and their linebacker coach Lance Thompson on January 16, when he was hired as linebacker coach by Tennessee. The following week, Saban named Sal Sunseri from the NFL's Carolina Panthers as his team's new assistant head and linebacker coach, and James Willis from Auburn as the new associate head and linebacker coach. {  style=\\"font- size:90%;\\" - !

The Tide dominated play for most of the game, outgaining Tech in total offense by 498 yards to 155, but mistakes, penalties, and poor play by the special teams allowed the Hokies to hang on until 18 fourth-quarter points sealed the 34–24 Alabama victory. Bama scored first with field goals of 49 and 34 yards from Leigh Tiffin to take an early 6–0 lead. The Hokies responded with a 98-yard Dyrell Roberts kickoff return for a touchdown to give Tech a 7–6 lead. Following the recovery of a Ryan Williams fumble by Brian Selman deep in Hokie territory, the Tide retook the lead 9–7 on a 32-yard Tiffin field goal. Early in the second quarter, Antoine Hopkins intercepted a Greg McElroy pass. On the ensuing possession, Tech led 10–9 after a successful 28-yard Matt Waldron field goal. Alabama responded by driving 76 yards for a touchdown and a 16–10 lead, with the big plays coming on a 14-yard run by Mark Ingram, passes of 16 and 10 yards from McElroy to Julio Jones and the score coming on a 19-yard Roy Upchurch run. On the next Virginia Tech possession, three personal fouls and a pass interference penalty carried the Hokies downfield with Williams scoring on a one-yard touchdown run. The score remained 17–16 at the half after Tiffin missed a 36-yard field goal at the end of the second quarter. In the third quarter Roy Upchurch fumbled the ball at the Tech nine after a long run, negating the lone scoring opportunity for either team in the third quarter. Still down by a point in the fourth quarter, McElroy hit Marquis Maze for a 48-yard completion to the Virginia Tech six-yard line, and Ingram scored a touchdown on the next play. A successful two-point conversion pass from McElroy to Colin Peek gave Alabama a 24–17 lead. On the ensuing kickoff, Davon Morgan fumbled and Chris Rogers recovered for the Tide at the Tech 21. The following Alabama drive stalled at the 3, but Tiffin's fourth field goal made the score 27–17. Poor kickoff coverage and penalties set up a 32-yard Williams that run cut the lead to 27–24 late in the fourth quarter. Alabama quickly struck back as Ingram rushed for 39 yards, McElroy completed a 19-yard pass to Peek, and then threw to Ingram for an 18-yard touchdown and a 34–24 lead. The Hokies never threatened to score again and Alabama won its opener, 34–24. Ingram led the Tide with 150 yards rushing on 26 carries and a pair of touchdowns, and he was named the SEC Offensive Player of the Week. The victory improved Alabama's all-time record against the Hokies to 11–1. ===Florida International=== Sources: The two teams getting ready for the opening kickoff The Golden Panthers of Florida International proved a tougher opponent than Alabama expected in the first half. However, the Tide pulled away with a 40–14 victory in the 2009 home opener. Alabama opened the scoring with a 23-yard Leigh Tiffin field goal followed by a 24-yard Greg McElroy touchdown pass to Mike McCoy, which gave Bama a 10–0 lead. FIU followed the McElroy touchdown with T. Y. Hilton returning the ensuing kickoff 96 yards, bringing the score to 10–7. Bama responded with a 29-yard Tiffin field goal to extend the lead to 13–7 early in the second quarter; the following kickoff was booted out of bounds, which set up the Golden Panthers at the 40. The ensuing 60-yard drive resulted in a 9-yard Paul McCall touchdown pass to Greg Ellingson that gave FIU a 14–13 lead. Bama responded with a 64-yard drive culminating with a two- yard Mark Ingram touchdown run to put Bama up 20–14 at the half. Trent Richardson continued the Alabama scoring in the third quarter with a nine-yard touchdown run to extend the lead to 26–14. A 46-yard punt return by Javier Arenas set up Richardson's second score on a 35-yard touchdown run on the first play of the fourth quarter. Alabama led 33–14. Terry Grant scored the Tide's final points with a 42-yard touchdown run to bring the final score to 40–14. Alabama outgained FIU 516–214 in total offense and 275–1 in rushing offense. Greg McElroy set an all-time Alabama record by completing 14 consecutive pass attempts and was 18–24 for 241 yards and a touchdown. For his 113-yard, two-touchdown rushing performance, Richardson was named the SEC Freshman of the Week. The victory improved Alabama's all-time record against the Golden Panthers to 2–0. ===North Texas=== Sources: Alabama's second consecutive matchup with a Sun Belt opponent on the season resulted in its second consecutive victory, as the Tide defeated the North Texas Mean Green 53–7. Greg McElroy opened the scoring with a two-yard touchdown run followed by a 34-yard touchdown pass to Marquis Maze to take a 14–0 first quarter lead. The Tide continued the scoring in the second quarter, with touchdowns on a one-yard Trent Richardson run and a 29-yard McElroy pass to Mark Ingram followed with a 35-yard Leigh Tiffin field goal. This gave Alabama a 30–0 lead at the half. In the third quarter, Bama extended their lead to 44–0 following touchdown runs of five and one yard respectively from Ingram and Terry Grant. After North Texas reached the end zone on a 34-yard Nathan Tune touchdown pass to Lance Dunbar, Alabama closed the game with ten fourth-quarter points on a 20-yard Tiffin field goal and 9-yard Grant touchdown run. Alabama outgained the Mean Green 523–187 in yards of total offense. It was the most points for Alabama in a game since beating Texas-El Paso 56–7 in 2001 and the most scored at Bryant–Denny since defeating Tulane 62–0 in 1991. By completing of 13 of 15 passes, McElroy tied a school record with an overall completion percentage of 86.7. The game was notable for McElroy as the North Texas head coach, Todd Dodge, was his high school head coach when McElroy led Southlake Carroll to the 2005 Texas Class 5A high school football championship. The victory improved Alabama's all-time record against the Mean Green to 3–0. ===Arkansas=== Sources: In Bobby Petrino's first visit to Tuscaloosa as a head coach, Alabama opened conference play by defeating the Arkansas Razorbacks 35–7. After a scoreless first quarter, two big touchdown plays, a 52-yard run by Trent Richardson and a 50-yard pass from Greg McElroy to Julio Jones, had the Tide up 14–0 at the half. Arkansas responded early in the third quarter and cut the lead to 14–7 after Ryan Mallett hit Greg Childs for an 18-yard touchdown reception; the Hogs would not reach the end zone again as the Tide responded with three unanswered touchdowns. Bama scored first on an 80-yard touchdown pass from McElroy to Marquis Maze followed with two touchdowns by Mark Ingram, one on a 14-yard pass from McElroy and one on a 2-yard run, bringing the final score to 35–7. Alabama outgained the Razorbacks 425–254 in yards of total offense. McElroy threw for career highs of 291 yards and three touchdowns. For his 65-yard, nine-carry, one-touchdown performance, Richardson was named the SEC Freshman of the Week. The victory improved Alabama's all- time record against the Razorbacks to 10–8 (13–7 without NCAA vacations and forfeits). ===Kentucky=== Sources: In Alabama's first trip to Lexington since 2004, and their first road game of the 2009 season, the Tide defeated the Kentucky Wildcats 38–20. Alabama scored on their opening drive after Javier Arenas returned the opening kickoff 60 yards, which set up an 11-yard Mark Ingram touchdown for an early 7–0 lead. Kentucky responded with a pair of 49-yard Lones Seiber field goals. The score was 7–6 at the end of the first quarter. The Tide extended their lead late in the second quarter following a nearly seven-minute, 13-play, 97-yard touchdown drive. Greg McElroy passes of 27 and 21 yards and a 13-yard run by Ingram moved Bama down the field, culminating with a three-yard touchdown pass from McElroy to Colin Peek to put the Tide up 14–6. With only 40 seconds remaining in the half, Kentucky tailback Derrick Locke fumbled the ball after catching a short pass. Courtney Upshaw returned 45 yards for an Alabama touchdown that put the Tide ahead 21–6 at halftime. On the second play of the third quarter, Rolando McClain intercepted a Mike Hartline pass, giving Alabama possession at the Wildcat 38. Two plays later Ingram scored on a 32-yard run, making the score 28–6.

Hartline connected with Randall Cobb for a 45-yard touchdown reception in bringing the score to 31–13. The Tide responded with a 7-yard Darius Hanks touchdown reception to complete a 13-play, 76-yard drive. Kentucky scored the afternoon's final points in the fourth quarter on a two-yard Alfonso Smith touchdown run. The final score was 38–20. Kentucky's four turnovers sabotaged an effort that was better than any other of Alabama's previous opponents, as the Wildcats gained 301 yards in total offense and held Alabama to 352. McElroy threw for two touchdowns, giving him nine on the season against only one interception, and Ingram rushed for 140 yards on 22 carries. For his 12 tackles (8 solo), one interception, one forced fumble and one pass break-up, McClain was named both the SEC Defensive Player of the Week and the Bronko Nagurski Award National Defensive Player of the Week. The victory improved Alabama's all-time record against the Wildcats to 35–2–1. ===Ole Miss=== Sources: Before the largest crowd to ever witness a game in Vaught–Hemingway Stadium, Alabama defeated their long-time rival, the Ole Miss Rebels, 22–3. Alabama struggled to put the ball in the end zone all afternoon with drives stalled at the Mississippi 8, 4, 4, 4, and 13. Each of those drives resulted in a field goal by Leigh Tiffin, who was 5 for 5 on the day. Other special teams contributions included a blocked punt in the second quarter and a recovered Dexter McCluster fumble on a punt return in the third quarter, both by Cory Reamer. McElroy struggled, completing only 15 of 34 passes for 147 yards, but Mark Ingram ran for a then career-high 172 yards and accounted for Alabama's only touchdown on a 36-yard run in the second quarter. The Alabama defense had an excellent day, with Javier Arenas, Kareem Jackson, Rolando McClain, and Cory Reamer each intercepting a Jevan Snead pass. Overall, the Tide held the Rebels to 212 yards of total offense and a single Joshua Shene field goal in the third quarter. center William Vlachos was named the SEC Offensive Lineman of the Week and Tiffin was named the Lou Groza Award \\"Star of Stars\\" for his five field goal performance. The victory was the team's sixth in a row over the Rebels and improved Alabama's all-time record against Ole Miss to 43–9–2 (47–8–2 without NCAA vacations and forfeits). ===South Carolina=== Sources: In South Carolina's first trip to Bryant–Denny since 2004, the Tide defeated the South Carolina Gamecocks 20–6 on homecoming in Tuscaloosa. On the second play from the start of the game, Mark Barron intercepted a Stephen Garcia pass and returned it 77 yards for a touchdown and a 7–0 Alabama lead. Greg McElroy struggled; he threw a pair of first-quarter interceptions on Bama's first two offensive possessions. South Carolina's C.C. Whitlock fumbled the ball on the return of the second interception and possession was recovered by Darius Hanks. The Tide continued its drive to the Gamecock 8, and Leigh Tiffin kicked a field goal to put Alabama ahead 10–0. Following a failed 49-yard Leigh Tiffin field goal attempt in the second quarter, South Carolina answered by driving to the Alabama five-yard line. However, the Bama defense held the Gamecock offense to three consecutive incompletions; the result was a 22-yard Spencer Lanning field goal to make the score 10–3. On the following possession, Mark Ingram ran 54 yards to the South Carolina 28. The drive stalled at the 17 and Tiffin's field goal made it 13–3. South Carolina responded with a quick drive that ended with a 31-yard Lanning field goal as time expired in the first half with the score 13–6. After a scoreless third quarter, with 8:08 to go, Alabama took possession at its own 32 following a Gamecock punt. Taking direct snaps out of the wildcat formation, Ingram rushed for 64 yards on five carries, then took a pitch from Greg McElroy for the last four yards and the touchdown, sealing Alabama's 20–6 victory. The Alabama offense turned the ball over four times in this game after committing only two turnovers in the first six games. Mark Ingram's 246 yards rushing marked his third consecutive career-high effort and the third highest single game total in Alabama history. For their performances, Ingram was named the SEC Offensive Player of the Week and Rolando McClain was named the Lott Trophy IMPACT Player of the Week. The victory improved Alabama's all- time record against the Gamecocks to 10–3 (12–2 before NCAA vacations and forfeits). ===Tennessee=== Sources: Alabama won the game, despite not getting a touchdown. This edition of the Third Saturday in October was a defensive struggle with a surprise finish as the Crimson Tide defeated the Tennessee Volunteers 12–10. In a defensive struggle for both teams, Leigh Tiffin was 4 for 4 on field goals and accounted for all of Alabama's scoring. With the Tennessee defense stopping the Tide on consecutive drives, Alabama's defense responded with Mark Barron intercepting a Jonathan Crompton pass at the Bama 19 in the first quarter. The ensuing drive resulted in a 38-yard Leigh Tiffin field goal and a 3–0 lead. The Vols responded with a 24-yard Daniel Lincoln field goal that tied the game 3–3. Tiffin hit field goals of 50 and 22 yards before Lincoln missed a 47-yard attempt at the end of the first half, leaving the score 9–3 at halftime. After a scoreless third, in the fourth Tennessee drove to the Alabama 27, but Terrence Cody blocked Lincoln's field goal. On the ensuing possession, Tiffin hit a 49-yard field goal to bring the score to 12–3. Late in the fourth, Mark Ingram lost a fumble for the first time in his collegiate career, giving Tennessee possession at the Alabama 43 with 3:29 remaining in the game. The Vols drove the ball 43 yards in 2:10, culminating with an 11-yard Crompton touchdown pass to Gerald Jones to cut the gap to 12–10. The Vols followed with a successful onside kick attempt and regained possession of the ball at their own 41-yard line. After Tennessee was penalized five yards for a false start, Crompton completed a pass to Luke Stocker for 23 yards, to the Bama 27-yard line. With the clock ticking off the final seconds and Tennessee out of time outs, Crompton spiked the ball to stop the clock with four seconds left. This set up Lincoln for a 45-yard field goal attempt to win the game. However, Terrence Cody knocked his blocker over and broke through the line. He blocked Lincoln's field goal as time expired, preserving Alabama's 12–10 victory and perfect season. For their performances, Cody was named the SEC Defensive Lineman of the Week and Tiffin was named the SEC Special Teams Player of the Week. ===LSU=== Sources: red zone. With the SEC West divisional championship on the line, Alabama defeated their long-time rival the LSU Tigers 24–15 to secure a spot in the SEC Championship Game. Following a scoreless first quarter, LSU took possession on its own 9 on the last play of the first quarter and embarked on a 13-play, 91-yard drive that ended in a 12-yard touchdown pass from Jordan Jefferson to Deangelo Peterson and a 7–0 lead. Javier Arenas returned the ensuing punt 40 yards to the Alabama 49, and the Tide drove to the LSU 11 before settling for a 28-yard Leigh Tiffin field goal that made the score 7–3. Neither team could mount a sustained drive for the rest of the half. At the start of the second half Alabama received the kickoff, took possession at its own 19, and started getting the ball to Mark Ingram. On the drive, Ingram was responsible for a 12-yard reception from Greg McElroy and rushes of 4, 12, 12, and 18 yards that advanced the ball to the Tiger 23. Two plays later, McElroy hit Darius Hanks for his first touchdown pass since the Kentucky game, and Alabama was up 10–7. The ensuing LSU drive stalled at the Tide 46. The LSU punt was downed at the Alabama 1-yard line. Two plays later McElroy was sacked for a safety, making the score 10–9. LSU returned the free kick to its own 41 and drove 59 yards for the touchdown, the big play coming on a 34-yard run by Charles Scott. The two-point conversion attempt failed, leaving the score 15–10 in favor of LSU. Alabama received the kickoff and again relied on Ingram: seven Ingram rushes for 48 yards accounted for most of the offense on a drive that ended with a 20-yard Tiffin field goal, making the score 15–13. Following a LSU three and out, Alabama took possession on its own 27-yard line. On first down, McElroy completed a screen pass to Julio Jones which Jones turned into a 73-yard touchdown. After a successful two-point conversion, Alabama led 21–15. LSU went three and out again. A methodical 11-play, 31-yard Alabama drive consumed 6:14 of game time and ended in a 40-yard Tiffin field goal with 3:04 left to seal a 24–15 Alabama victory. Alabama won the SEC Western Division championship and clinched a berth in the SEC Championship Game against Florida, which clinched the East that same day with a 27–3 victory over Vanderbilt. Ingram rushed for 144 yards and Jones had 102 receiving yards. The victory improved Alabama's all-time record against the Tigers to 45–23–5. ===Mississippi State=== Sources: Playing in front of the largest crowd to ever witness a game in Davis Wade Stadium, and with the Bulldogs wearing black jerseys for the first time in their history, Alabama cruised to a 31–3 victory over long-time rival Mississippi State. After a scoreless first quarter, Alabama scored a pair of touchdowns in the second to take a 14–0 lead. The first touchdown came on a 45-yard Darius Hanks reception from Greg McElroy and the second on a 1-yard Mark Ingram run. After a 39-yard field goal by Leigh Tiffin extended the lead to 17–0 in the third, the Bulldogs scored their only points of the night on a 34-yard Derek DePasquale field goal. On the ensuing kickoff, Javier Arenas returned the ball 46 yards and on the next play, McElroy hit Julio Jones for a 48-yard touchdown reception. The score was 24–3. Mark Barron intercepted a Tyson Lee pass at the Alabama 30 on the next Bulldog offensive series. On the following play, Ingram scored a touchdown on a 70-yard run to bring the final score to 31–3. For the game, McElroy threw for 192 yards and two touchdowns on 13 of 18 passing, and Mark Ingram rushed for 149 yards two touchdowns. Mississippi State was held to 213 total yards, with Barron intercepting two Tyson Lee and Marquis Johnson intercepting one Chris Relf pass. For his performance, left guard Mike Johnson was named the SEC Offensive Lineman of the Week. The victory improved Alabama's all-time record against the Bulldogs to 73–18–3 (72–19–3 without NCAA vacations and forfeits). ===Chattanooga=== Sources: Javier Arenas returned a kickoff for touchdown in the second quarter. On senior day in Tuscaloosa, Alabama dipped down to college football's Football Championship Subdivision and defeated the Mocs of UT-Chattanooga 45–0. After being stopped on their first possession, Alabama reached the end zone on the next five consecutive possessions in running up a 35–0 lead in the first half. First-quarter touchdowns included a 2-yard Trent Richardson run, a 25-yard Mark Ingram run, and a 19-yard Julio Jones reception from Greg McElroy. In the second quarter, touchdowns were scored by Javier Arenas on a 66-yard punt return and on a 40-yard Ingram run. With the only third quarter points coming on a 41-yard Leigh Tiffin field goal, Bama's final points of the afternoon came on a 21-yard Roy Upchurch touchdown run in the fourth. Javier Arenas set the all-time SEC record with his seventh punt return for a touchdown and was named the SEC Special Teams Player of the Week. Mark Ingram led the offense with 102 yards and two touchdowns before being pulled early in the second quarter. Alabama outgained Chattanooga in total offense 422–84 and recorded their first defensive shutout since defeating Auburn 36–0 in 2008. The victory improved Alabama's all-time record against the Mocs to 11–0. ===Auburn=== Sources: One year after Alabama's 36–0 victory in Tuscaloosa, the 2009 Iron Bowl contest against the Auburn Tigers ended with a 26–21 Tide victory and a 12–0 regular season. The Tigers, who entered the game 7–4 and unranked, took the ball after Alabama's initial three and out and struck quickly. On Auburn's fourth play from scrimmage, Terrell Zachery raced 67 yards on a reverse for a touchdown and a 7–0 Auburn lead. The run was the longest allowed by the Tide since a 70-yard run by Arkansas' Darren McFadden in 2005. Auburn then successfully executed an onside kick and retained possession of the ball. After the onside kick, Auburn drove 58 yards in 12 plays, scoring on a 1-yard touchdown pass from Chris Todd to Eric Smith. The Crimson Tide, which had never trailed in a game by more than seven points all season, found itself down 14–0 before the first quarter was over. Early in the second quarter Alabama completed a 10-play, 58-yard drive by scoring on a two- yard run by backup tailback Trent Richardson. The key plays were a 15-yard pass from McElroy to Darius Hanks and a 13-yard pass from McElroy to Richardson. After an exchange of punts gave Alabama good starting position at the Auburn 45, the Tide quickly struck again with McElroy hitting tight end Colin Peek on a 33-yard touchdown pass that left the game tied 14–14 at halftime. In the third quarter, Auburn scored on another quick strike. The Tigers took possession on their 24 after a Bama punt; Kodi Burns rushed for four yards, and then Todd hit Darvin Adams on a 72-yard completion that put Auburn back in front 21–14. The completion marked the longest play from scrimmage allowed by the Bama defense all season and the longest pass play since 1999. Javier Arenas gave Alabama an opportunity by returning the ensuing kickoff 46 yards to the Auburn 45, but Mark Ingram, who struggled the entire game, rushed for 7 yards and 2 yards and then was held for no gain on both third and one and fourth and one, and Alabama turned the ball over on downs. Auburn went three and out and punted, and Arenas set the Tide up again, returning the punt 56 yards to the Auburn 33-yard line. Alabama drove to the Auburn 10 before settling for a Leigh Tiffin field goal that cut the deficit to 21–17. Alabama kicked off and two plays later, Auburn quarterback Todd threw an interception that gave Alabama possession at the Auburn 43. The Tide drove to the Tigers' 13 before this drive also stalled, forcing another Leigh Tiffin field goal that made the score 21–20. As the third quarter ended, Auburn continued to hang on to a one-point lead. Neither team could make progress with possessions early in the fourth quarter, and after an exchange of punts, Alabama got the ball on its own 21 with 8:27 to go, and began what would soon be known as \\"The Drive\\". Richardson opened with a 7-yard rush, and on third and three, McElroy completed a nine-yard pass to Julio Jones for a first down. Three plays later, on third and five, McElroy completed a six-yard pass to Jones for another first down and advancing the ball to the Tide 48. Two plays later, on second and eight, a third pass from McElroy to Jones for 11 yards led to a third first down. Two plays after that, a fourth pass from McElroy to Jones and a fourth first down at the Auburn 28-yard line. On second and nine at the Auburn 27, McElroy chose a different target, hitting Richardson for a first down to the Auburn 11-yard line. After a four-yard run by Richardson to the Auburn 7, the Tigers called time out with 1:34 left. Richardson took the ball three more yards to the Auburn 4, leaving the Tide at third and three. Each team called a time out in succession with 1:29 left. Alabama's offensive coaches called for a running play, but head coach Nick Saban, unwilling to settle for a field goal, overruled this decision and demanded a pass. McElroy completed a 4-yard touchdown pass to third-string tailback Roy Upchurch, giving Alabama a 26–21 lead with 1:24 to go. McElroy had completed seven consecutive passes on The Drive after missing his first. A two-point conversion attempt failed and the lead was five points. Auburn took possession at the 25 following the kickoff and took 1:14 to run four plays and advance the ball to its own 46 with ten seconds to go. Todd completed a 17-yard pass to Darvin Adams at the Alabama 37, and after spiking the ball, Todd's last pass fell incomplete and the game was over. Alabama had survived, beating Auburn 26–21 despite being outgained 332 yards to 291 and being held to only 73 yards rushing. ===Florida=== Sources: Alabama faced Florida in the SEC Championship Game in a rematch of the 2008 contest, with the Tide capturing their 22nd conference championship following their 32–13 victory over the Gators. The Tide struck first, driving 47 yards with the opening possession before Leigh Tiffin kicked a 48-yard field goal and a 3–0 lead. Following a Florida three and out on their first possession, Alabama responded with an 8-play, 76-yard touchdown drive. On the drive, Greg McElroy completed key passes to Colin Peek and Marquis Maze and Mark Ingram rushed for 37 yards and the touchdown in taking a 9–0 lead following a missed extra point. On the ensuing possession, Caleb Sturgis hit a 48-yard field goal that made the score 9–3 at the end of the first quarter. Alabama scored first in the second quarter on a 34-yard Tiffin field goal to complete a 68-yard drive and extend the Bama lead to 12–3. Florida followed with what turned out to be its only touchdown drive of the game. Rushes of 23 yards and 15 yards from quarterback and former Heisman Trophy winner Tim Tebow were followed by a 23-yard touchdown pass from Tebow to David Nelson, and Florida had cut the lead to two, 12–10. On the next offensive play, Ingram took a short pass from McElroy and raced 69 yards to the Gator 3-yard line, and ran it in for a touchdown from three yards out on the next play. The Gators ended the first half with a 32-yard Sturgis field goal to make the halftime score 19–13. Florida opened the third quarter with a three and out. On the Tide's first offensive series of the second half, McElroy completed a 28-yard pass to Maze and was followed with a 15-yard personal foul penalty in bringing the ball into the red zone. On the next play McElroy completed the drive with a 17-yard touchdown pass to tight end Colin Peek. Alabama took a 26–13 lead. Florida got one first down on its next possession before punting the ball to Alabama. Taking the ball at its own 12-yard line with 7:36 to go in the third quarter, Alabama held the ball for the rest of the quarter and into the fourth, using up 8:47 of game time on a 12-play, 88-yard drive. Ingram, who rushed for 37 yards on the drive, scored on a 1-yard touchdown run early in the fourth quarter to increase Bama's lead to 32–13. Florida mounted a late drive that reached the Alabama 6 before Tebow threw an interception to Javier Arenas in the end zone. On Florida's next possession, the Gators turned the ball over on downs at the Alabama 13, and the Tide was able to run out the clock to secure the 32–13 victory. For his 239-yard, one touchdown passing performance, Greg McElroy was named the game's MVP. Ingram rushed for 113 and Trent Richardson rushed for 80 yards. The victory gave Alabama its 22nd SEC title, their third since the inception of the Championship Game and their first in ten years—the longest time the Crimson Tide program has ever gone without an SEC championship. The victory improved Alabama's all-time record against the Gators to 20–14 (21–14 without the NCAA vacation of the 2005 victory). Alabama earned their third SEC championship since the inception of the SEC Championship Game in 1992, and their 22nd SEC title. ===Texas=== Sources: 50-yard line action for the national championship Following victories in their respective conference championship games, on December 6 the final Bowl Championship Series (BCS) standings were unveiled, pitting the No. 1 ranked Crimson Tide against the No. 2 ranked Texas Longhorns for the 2010 BCS National Championship. The game was held in the Rose Bowl, although it was not the actual Rose Bowl Game, in which Ohio State beat Oregon six days earlier. Alabama came into the game having never beaten Texas, compiling an all-time 0–7–1 record against the Longhorns. Alabama won the toss and elected to receive the opening kickoff. After losing thirteen yards on a sack and a penalty, Nick Saban called for a fake punt, which resulted in a Texas interception by Blake Gideon at the Alabama 37-yard line. On the initial possession, Texas quarterback Colt McCoy suffered a hit from Marcell Dareus which forced him to leave the game. Suffering from a pinched nerve in his throwing shoulder, McCoy did not return. With McCoy out, freshman Garrett Gilbert replaced him at quarterback, and the Longhorns settled for a field goal and a 3–0 lead. The ensuing kickoff was an onside kick, and Texas retained possession of the ball when Alabama failed to field the kick. The Longhorns only advanced the ball five yards and Hunter Lawrence kicked another field goal to go ahead 6–0. Coaches' Trophy on display at the Paul W. Bryant Museum The Tide went ahead in the second quarter. Greg McElroy threw for only 58 yards on 6 of 11 passing for Alabama, but 23 of those yards came on a completion to Julio Jones that advanced the ball to the Texas 12. Three plays later Mark Ingram ran it in from two yards out, and Alabama went ahead 7–6. After an exchange of punts, Bama took possession on the Texas 49-yard line, and on the second play Trent Richardson burst through a hole in the middle and raced 49 yards untouched for the touchdown, extending the lead to 14–6. Texas continued to struggle for offense in McCoy's absence, and on the next possession a Texas drive ended when Javier Arenas intercepted a Gilbert pass at the Alabama 25. Following a short punt late in the quarter, Bama drove to the Texas 9, and increased their lead to 17–6 following a successful 26-yard Leigh Tiffin field goal. It appeared that the Crimson Tide would go into the locker room leading 17–6. However, after gaining nine yards on a rush up the middle, Texas called time out with 15 seconds left. With the ball at the Texas 37, Gilbert threw a shovel pass to D.J. Monroe, who bobbled the ball and batted it into the arms of Alabama defensive lineman Marcell Dareus, who lumbered 28 yards for a touchdown that made the halftime score 24–6. Having been sacked 4 times in the first half but had considerable success rushing the ball, Alabama came out rushing after halftime, attempting only two passes in the 3rd quarter. Meanwhile, Gilbert, who had struggled early in the game, started to find his rhythm, mostly due to the efforts of Jordan Shipley, one of only two Texas receivers to catch a pass thrown beyond the line of scrimmage in the game. A 44-yard touchdown pass from Gilbert to Shipley cut the lead to 24–13. Early in the fourth, Leigh Tiffin missed a 52-yard field goal. On the ensuing possession, the Longhorns drove 65 yards and scored another touchdown on a 28-yard Shipley reception. A successful two- point conversion pulled the score to within three points, 24–21. Following an Alabama punt, Texas gained possession on their own 7-yard line with 3:14 to go. On the second play of the drive, Eryk Anders laid a hit on Gilbert that forced a fumble, and Alabama recovered at the Texas 3. Three plays later Ingram, who rushed for 116 yards in the game, ran it in for the score that gave Alabama a 31–21 lead. On the following drive, Gilbert threw a second interception to Arenas, and a Trent Richardson touchdown with 47 seconds left made the final score 37–21. For their performances, Mark Ingram was named the game's offensive MVP and Marcell Dareus was named defensive MVP. Alabama beat Texas for the first time in their history, won its first ever BCS championship game, and won its first national championship since 1992. It was Alabama's thirteenth claimed and eighth national championship by vote of the AP poll or coaches' poll, the others coming in 1961, 1964, 1965, 1973, 1978, 1979, and 1992, and ninth perfect season, the others coming in 1925, 1930, 1934, 1945, 1961, 1966, 1979, and 1992. Alabama became the third school in major college history to go 14–0, joining the 2002 Ohio State Buckeyes and the 2009 Boise State Broncos. ==Rankings== Entering the 2009 season, the Crimson Tide was ranked No. 5 in the AP and Coaches' Preseason Polls.

Following the victory against Texas for the national championship, the team arrived at the Tuscaloosa Regional Airport on the evening of January 8. Several thousand fans were there to greet them upon their arrival. On January 16, a public national championship celebration at Bryant–Denny Stadium was attended by well over 30,000 spectators. Speakers at the event included head coach Nick Saban and Alabama athletic director Mal Moore. All of the championship trophies were available for public viewing. In early March, the team was invited to the White House, where Obama greeted the team and offered congratulatory remarks for their championship season. For their victory, each team member and coach received three championship rings designed by Jostens: a university-issued title ring, a BCS issued title ring, and another for winning the SEC championship. The rings were distributed as part of the annual A-Day weekend the following April. Also as part of the A-Day celebrations, the 2009 team captains Javier Arenas, Rolando McClain, and Mike Johnson were honored at the Walk of Fame ceremony at the base of Denny Chimes. As recognition for becoming the fifth Alabama head coach to win a national championship, the University unveiled a statue of coach Saban along the Walk of Champions outside Bryant–Denny Stadium as part of A-Day festivities on April 16, 2011. ===Final statistics=== After their victory over Texas in the BCS National Championship Game, Alabama's final team statistics were released.

Its congregation forms part of the Protestant Reformed Church of Alsace and Lorraine. Because of its central location on the main square of Mulhouse, the Place de la Réunion, and its 97 metre high bell tower (the highest steeple in the department of Haut-Rhin), it is sometimes referred to as the \\"Cathedral of Mulhouse\\" (Cathédrale de Mulhouse). The church was designed by the city architect Jean-Baptiste Schacre, who also designed the large Catholic St. Stephen's Church (Église Saint-Étienne). ==History== Until 1858, the former parish church of St. Stephen stood at the location of the current building. The originally late Romanesque building from the 12th century was expanded at the beginning of the 14th century in the Gothic style. A substantially higher choir was added to the nave. In 1510, the Romanesque bell tower was remodelled in the style of the Renaissance. In 1707, the bell tower was crowned with an onion dome. In 1857, the city council of Mulhouse decided to replace the place of worship, which had come to be looked upon as dilapidated, by a new building. The city architect Schacre, who had already constructed the main synagogue of the city and the Catholic St. Stephen's Church, designed a church in the neo-Gothic style with a simple, rectangular ground plan without a transept and choir. In contrast to the long Catholic church, it was a squat, but very wide building. The bell tower, which is visible from quite a distance away, stands behind the building, in contrast to its model on the Freiburg Minster. The current church was built between 1859 and 1866. Since February 2009 and prospectively until late 2019, the church is subjected to a progressive restoration of all its exterior and interior parts. The work had started with the complete scaffolding of the steeple. ==Furnishings== A considerable part of the furnishings of the previous building were used in the St. Stephen's church of Jean-Baptiste Schacre. The most important of all the artistic treasures of the city of Mulhouse are the large leaded-glass windows from 1320 to 1350, famous for their vivid design and rich colors. They were originally in the choir and were set into the clerestory windows. The Baroque choir stalls of dark oak are from 1637. The stone church monument of Baron Friedrich Ludwig Waldner von Freundstein (1735), an important work of the local late Baroque period, was erected in the assembly room of the new church. Of the Silbermann organ made by Johann Andreas Silbermann (1765), only the case remains; it was moved into the Reformed St. John's Church (Temple Saint-Jean) of the city, when the old church was torn down. The current organ comes from the workshop of Eberhard Friedrich Walcker, but has been altered many times since it was installed in 1866, especially by the Schwenkedel organ manufacturer. The Baroque pulpit from 1647 is found in the Reformed church of Illzach today. The main steeple houses the largest set of bells of any Protestant church in France. The five bells were cast in 1867 in Zurich. === Gallery === File:Stephanskirche Steinbachplatz Muelhausen 1900.jpgView of St. Stephen's Church around 1900 File:Templeplacereunion.jpgOther view of the façade File:Dom Mulhouse von Rue de Sauvage.JPGThe bell tower dominates the skyline of Mulhouse File:Mulhouse - Temple Saint-Étienne2.jpgThe church under restoration, 2010 ==References== *Scheurer, Marie-Philippe; Lehni, Roger; Menninger, Claude: Mulhouse, Haut- Rhin − Images du Patrimoine, Le Verger, Illkirch-Graffenstaden, 1990, ==External links== *Website of the parish *History of the church, with contemporary pictures *Exterior and interior views *The Walcker organ *The choir organ Category:Buildings and structures in Mulhouse Mulhouse Category:Gothic Revival architecture in France Category:Gothic Revival church buildings Category:Monuments historiques of Haut-Rhin Category:Churches completed in 1866 Category:1866 establishments in France Mulhouse ","title":"Temple Saint-Étienne"},{"id":"20523215","text":"The Hudson Formula derives from Hudsons Building and Engineering Contracts and is used for the assessment of delay damages in construction claims.

It can be distinguished from the related sawtooth eels by its reduced dentition, which more resemble those of the snipe eel. It is of no significance to fisheries. ==Distribution and habitat== Stemonidium hypomelas is widely distributed in the Pacific Ocean and the southern Atlantic Ocean, at depths of 500-1,229 m. Scientific trawls conducted off Hawaii show that this species occurs below 550 m during the day, with most between 700–800 m. At night, a small subset of the population migrates upward to a minimum depth of 175 m. ==Description== Stemonidium hypomelas has an elongated, band-shaped body, nearly of uniform depth in the middle and tapering towards the head and tail. The dorsal profile from the back of the head to the base of the rostrum is nearly straight; the jaws are long and taper to a very delicate, slender tip, with the lower slightly longer than the upper. The teeth are reduced to small granular plates arranged in a quincunx on the jaws and vomer with the pointed tips pointing backward. The eyes are very small and located in the middle of the head. There are two pairs of slit-shaped nostrils in front of the eyes, the anterior shorter than the posterior. The gill slits are long and very oblique. The long dorsal and anal fins both begin about half a head length behind the gill opening. The first fin rays of the dorsal fin are delicate and difficult to detect. The anal fin is somewhat taller than the dorsal, with the fin rays of both becoming longer and more crowded towards the tail. The tail is short and pointed, but not filamentous. There is no lateral line. The upper half of the body is light gray and covered with fine black specks of pigment, and the lower half is abruptly jet black. The head is entirely black, becoming lighter at the tips of the jaws and the back of the head, and the last sixth of the tail is also black. The fins are all lighter in color. The males are smaller than the females, with larger nasal rosettes and eyes, and sometimes flatter tails. The maximum known length is 22.0 cm for a male and 37.5 cm for a female. ==Biology and ecology== Analysis of stomach contents show that Stemonidium hypomelas feed on crustaceans, mostly euphausiids but rarely also shrimps and amphipods. Reproduction is oviparous, with high reported fecundities ranging from 7,000 to almost 14,000 eggs per female. Female length at maturation varies from 22–30 cm, and the large size of their gonads relative to their bodies suggests that they may be semelparous, investing a high proportion of their available resources into a single, large batch of eggs. The males mature at 17.5–20 cm long; their better-developed nares and eyes may be an adaptation for finding widely scattered mates in the open ocean. ==References== Category:Serrivomeridae Category:Fish described in 1905 Category:Monotypic fish genera ","title":"Stemonidium hypomelas"},{"id":"20523276","text":"Eu Sou Todos Nós is the fourteenth studio album by Brazilian solo artist Zé Ramalho.

The album features a protest song called \\"Sem Terra\\".

It was first published by Harper & Row in 1975. == Background and content == Navrozov was a freelance translator who had resisted joining the Communist Party of the Soviet Union but had managed to secure an effective monopoly over English translations for publication, and enjoyed a privileged lifestyle as a result. He began his clandestine study of the history of the Stalinist regime in 1953 after Stalin's death, in the hopes of smuggling the manuscripts abroad. Navrozov managed to defect to the West with his family in 1972, travelling through Israel to the United States. The Education, published three years later, covered the first seven years of Navrozov's life, from the end of Lenin's New Economic Policy in 1928, to 1935. It recounts the contemporary effects of Joseph Stalin's public relations campaign in the aftermath of the assassination of rival Sergei Kirov. A blend of personal recollections, social commentary and political history, the memoir was a best- seller, establishing Navrozov as a prominent Russian dissident.Thought, Fordham University Press, , , p.140 == Reception == \\"It bids fair to take its place beside the works of Laurence Sterne and Henry Adams,\\" wrote the American philosopher Sidney Hook, \\"… but it is far richer in scope and more gripping in content.\\" Eugene Lyons, author of the pioneering 1937 work Assignment in Utopia, described the book as \\"uniquely revealing\\", while Robert Massie, author of Nicholas and Alexandra, wrote of the author’s \\"individual genius.\\" In a review for The New York Review of Books, Helen Muchnic took issue with Navrozov's characterisation of Russian Futurist poet Vladimir Mayakovsky, calling Navrozov as a \\"hardened cynic\\" unequal to \\"complex, majestic theme of Russia\\" and who lacked the \\"necessary objectivity and patience\\". In a subsequent letter to the editor to the Review, Navrosov called Muchnic's review \\"a stimulating study in creative sterility out to destroy blindly whatever endangers its stock of clichés\\", proposing that it was composed of uncritical restatements of Soviet propaganda and gratuitous, unfounded insults. Saul Bellow, the Nobel Prize–winning novelist, responded to The Education by using Navrozov as the model for a modern Russian dissident thinker in two of his books, thereby beginning a lively correspondence that continued until the American novelist's death. Bellow cited Navrozov, along with Sinyavsky, Vladimir Maximov and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, as one of his epoch's \\"commanding figures\\" and \\"men of genius.\\" In Bellow's non-fictional account To Jerusalem and Back, Navrozov is referred to in the same vein, this time by the author. == References  External links == *\\"Be infinitely devoted to your beloved owners\\": Commentary on The Education from Unqualified Reservations, including an excerpt of the book's first chapter * Category:1975 non-fiction books Category:Russian memoirs Category:Political autobiographies Category:Memoirs about Soviet repression Category:Harper & Row books ","title":"The Education of Lev Navrozov"},{"id":"20523389","text":"The Chicago Blackhawks are an American professional ice hockey team based in Chicago, Illinois.

He coached for two years in the 1930s. On the 1934 Stanley Cup win, Tobin is listed as secretary-treasurer. In 1938, Tobin was named president of the team, and for all practical purposes was general manager from that time forward, although McLaughlin stated at the time that it was a change in title only. After McLaughlin died, Tobin was part-owner and president of the team. The actual title of general manager was created in 1952, and Bill Tobin held the title in addition to the title of vice-president. Even when Tommy Ivan was hired in 1954, his title was manager of hockey operations, including the farm team. ==Key== {  style=\\"font-size:90%;\\" +Key of terms and definitions - ! scope=\\"col\\" Term ! scope=\\"col\\" Definition - !scope=\\"row\\" No. Number of general managers - !scope=\\"row\\" Ref(s) References - !scope=\\"row\\" – Does not apply - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"background: #FFE6BD\\"  Elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in the Builder category } ==General managers== {  +General managers of the Chicago Blackhawks ! scope=\\"col\\"  No. ! scope=\\"col\\"  Name ! scope=\\"col\\"  Tenure ! scope=\\"col\\"  Accomplishments during this term ! scope=\\"col\\"  Ref(s) - ! scope=\\"row\\" 1  style=\\"background: #FFE6BD;\\" Frederic McLaughlin  September 25, 1926 – 1942 * Won Stanley Cup 2 times in 3 finals appearances (1931, 1934, 1938) * 11 playoff appearances  - ! scope=\\"row\\" 2  Bill Tobin  1942 – July 7, 1954 * 1 Stanley Cup Finals appearance (1944) * 3 playoff appearances  - ! scope=\\"row\\" 3  style=\\"background: #FFE6BD;\\" Tommy Ivan  July 7, 1954 – July 6, 1977 * Won Stanley Cup 1 time in 5 finals appearances (1961, 1962, 1965, 1971, 1973) * 5 division titles and 18 playoff appearances  - ! scope=\\"row\\" 4  Bob Pulford  July 6, 1977 – June 5, 1990 *6 division titles and 13 playoff appearances  - ! scope=\\"row\\" 5  Mike Keenan  June 5, 1990 – November 6, 1992 * Won Presidents' Trophy (1990–91) * 1 Stanley Cup Finals appearance (1992) * 1 conference title, 1 division title, and 2 playoff appearances  - ! scope=\\"row\\" –  Bob Pulford  November 6, 1992 – July 3, 1997 * 1 division title and 5 playoff appearances  - ! scope=\\"row\\" 6  Bob Murray  July 3, 1997 – December 2, 1999 * No playoff appearances  - ! scope=\\"row\\" –  Bob Pulford (Interim)  December 2, 1999 – September 22, 2000 * No playoff appearances  - ! scope=\\"row\\" 7  Mike Smith  September 22, 2000 – October 24, 2003 * 1 playoff appearance  - ! scope=\\"row\\" –  Bob Pulford  October 24, 2003 – June 21, 2005 * No playoff appearances  - ! scope=\\"row\\" 8  Dale Tallon  June 21, 2005 – July 14, 2009 * 1 playoff appearance  - ! scope=\\"row\\" 9  Stan Bowman  July 14, 2009 – present * Won Stanley Cup 3 times (2010, 2013, 2015) * Won Presidents' Trophy (2012–13) * 3 conference titles, 3 division titles, and 8 playoff appearances  } ==Notes== * A running total of the number of general managers of the franchise.

Jonathan Crompton threw five touchdown passes, leading the Volunteers to a 63–7 rout of Football Bowl Subdivision newcomers Western Kentucky and their largest margin of victory in nine years. \\"This is the way that we expect to play,\\" Kiffin said. \\"We have high expectations here. I just talked to them about understanding that was one game and it's over. We've got to find a way to play better next week.\\" In its first two drives, Tennessee looked as if it hadn't learned much under Kiffin, the youngest active coach in the division. Crompton threw a pass over the middle that was easily tipped by Thomas Majors and intercepted by Jamal Forrest, and Montario Hardesty fumbled after a hard hit. The Vols settled down after the first quarter, and Hardesty carried for 18 and 22 yards to help set up a 2-yard touchdown run by freshman Bryce Brown early in the second quarter. Bobby Rainey fumbled on the Hilltoppers' next play, and LaMarcus Thompson recovered for Tennessee. Crompton connected with Luke Stocker on his first of two touchdown catches to make it 14–0 only 7 seconds later. Tennessee's defense looked every bit the stalwart it was in 2008, while the offense found the composure it was missing in last year's 5–7 season. Running backs broke through the line of scrimmage, wide receivers ran sound routes and Crompton threw accurately. \\"We really just tried to get our personality as a team on film. We wanted to be physical but smart. The game we just played is part of our resume, and we want to build that resume and send it out to our opponents,\\" Vols safety Eric Berry said. The receiving corps hardly looked depleted by injuries, with Stocker, Marsalis Teague, Quintin Hancock and Brandon Warren each catching scoring strikes. Crompton, who was pulled with 12:26 left in the game, finished 21 of 28 with two picks, and his five TD passes was one more than his output last season. Hardesty finished with 160 yards and a touchdown on 18 carries, and Brown had 104 yards rushing and a touchdown on 11 attempts. The Hilltoppers couldn't capitalize on the early turnovers and had minus-21 yards after their first 19 plays. Tennessee finished with 657 yards compared to Western Kentucky's 83. Rainey had the Hilltoppers' only score on a 19-yard run with 2:41 in the third quarter that made it 35–7. The win was the Vols' easiest since a 70–3 victory over Louisiana-Monroe in 2000. Their 380 yards rushing were the most since 2004. The Vols were also joined by former Vols and current Indianapolis Colts quarterback Peyton Manning, who before the game announced a $1 million gift for a new athletic training center. Though the attendance in the 100,011-capacity Neyland Stadium only reached 98,761, the fans turned out in droves as Kiffin and the Vols made the traditional \\"Vol Walk\\" from their buses to the stadium before the game. \\"I really had to make sure that I did not go up and down today, because that's what I talked about with our team a long time last night – dealing with the emotions of a wonderful scene like the Vol Walk, a wonderful event like running through the 'T' and playing in front of 100,000 people,\\" Kiffin said. Western Kentucky went on to go 0–12 and finish last in the Sun Belt Conference. ===UCLA=== Even with offensive guru Norm Chow in the press box, UCLA coach Rick Neuheisel turned to his defense with the game on the line. It was the right call. UCLA stopped Tennessee's Montario Hardesty on fourth-and-2 in the closing minutes, and the Bruins made it two in a row against the Volunteers with a 19–15 victory Saturday. \\"We will be a better offense,\\" Neuheisel said. \\"But given the way our offense was playing, I thought it was better to put it in [the defense's] hands.\\" Trailing by 6, the Vols (1–1) had a chance to take the lead after driving 52 yards, but UCLA (2–0) held fast and Lane Kiffin lost for the first time as Tennessee coach. The Vols' defense, led by Monte Kiffin, had been battering the Bruins' offense for much of the day. UCLA had only 186 yards of offense compared to Tennessee's 208. The Bruins had four fewer first downs, held the ball for three fewer minutes and had 60 more yards in penalties. Tennessee reached UCLA's Kevin Prince many times, but usually after he released the ball. After Hardesty was stopped, Tennessee got a safety when Dennis Rogan sacked Prince, giving him a bloody mouth. An inept Jonathan Crompton couldn't do anything with the last-minute opportunity after getting the ball back, taking a sack and throwing three incomplete passes. Lane Kiffin said he saw a few of his players trying to point fingers in the locker room after the game. \\"I told them that isn't what we are. That isn't what a championship mentality is. A little bit of finger pointing came out and we have to teach them,\\" he said. \\"You either win or you lose, and everybody on that team lost today.\\" For the Bruins, the win in Neyland Stadium in front of 102,239 fans was a big step toward recovering from last year's 4–8 finish. \\"We're hungry,\\" safety Rahim Moore said. \\"We are trying to come out every day and every weekend to prove to the world that UCLA is who UCLA is.\\" For the Vols, it means a lot of work this week as they prepare for a trip to Florida – especially on Crompton, who unraveled after throwing five touchdown passes in the season opener against Western Kentucky. On the first play after halftime, he threw his third interception of the day and second to Moore, who has five for the season. Kai Forbath kicked a 39-yard field goal four plays later for a 13–10 lead. \\"I just read the quarterback,\\" Moore said. \\"I knew that Crompton had some skills, but I also knew that he could throw a pick because any quarterback can. I was just sitting back and reading the quarterback.\\" Kiffin, who has pledged not to shuffle quarterbacks during games, stuck with Crompton. Tennessee went three- and-out on its next two drives, and Forbath answered with field goals of 31 and 47 yards to give UCLA a 19–10 lead with 2:39 in the third quarter. Forbath, who beat Tennessee with an overtime field goal in California last season, made four field goals in the rematch. Prince finished 11-for-23 for 101 yards and the one touchdown. Johnathan Franklin had 80 yards rushing. In the second quarter, Crompton fumbled a snap at the Tennessee 36, and Jerzy Siewierski recovered. A few plays later, Prince threw a 12-yard touchdown pass to Chane Moline as he was being hit, tying the score at 10 with 7:09 before halftime. Crompton threw interceptions on the next two drives. He overthrew Gerald Jones on the first and hit Moore instead. On the second, he threw right to Alterraun Verner. \\"I didn't do a very good job today taking care of Jonathan,\\" Lane Kiffin said. \\"I gave him a couple of calls unfortunately that didn't put him in the best position. We've got to do a better job around him.\\" Crompton completed 13 of 26 passes for 93 yards. Hardesty finished with 89 yards rushing. But the Bruins couldn't capitalize on either. UCLA went three- and-out on the first, and Forbath missed a 51-yard field goal to end the half. UCLA had its own problems hanging onto the ball. The Bruins fumbled five times, losing the ball once. Willie Bohannan sacked Prince, causing a fumble, and Gerald Williams recovered at the UCLA 11. Hardesty took care of the rest on the next play to put Tennessee up 10–3 with 2:58 in the first quarter. \\"We really didn't get into our groove as an offense,\\" Crompton said. \\"When you don't, some doubts come, but the upside is we were in that game at the end. We had four turnovers and we still came up 1 yard short. That is the one positive.\\" UCLA went on to go 7–6 and finish eighth in the Pac-10 Conference. ===Florida=== Tennessee coach Lane Kiffin jogged to midfield, briefly shook hands with Florida's Urban Meyer and then darted toward the locker room. Kiffin kept his head up the whole way. Who could blame him? After all, he had more reason to be encouraged than embarrassed after his Southeastern Conference opener against the top-ranked Gators. Tim Tebow ran for 76 yards and a touchdown, Caleb Sturgis kicked three field goals and Florida eked out a 23–13 win over the Volunteers on Saturday. It wasn't the beatdown many expected. It gave Kiffin reason to believe Tennessee (1–2, 0–1) is on the right track. It gave Meyer a big enough scare that it could help the defending national champions the rest of the way. \\"It wasn't how we envisioned or hoped,\\" said Tebow, whose streak of games with a TD pass ended at 30. \\"But it's a win and it's good enough for all of us.\\" The Gators (3–0, 1–0) won their fifth straight in the series and set a school record with their 13th consecutive victory, now the longest in major college football after losses by Utah and Southern California. Florida started counting down the days for this one more than nine months ago, right after Kiffin vowed to sing \\"Rocky Top\\" all night long after beating the Gators. Kiffin also riled up Florida with his false allegations of NCAA violations by Meyer. Kiffin ran out of the tunnel just before the opening kick and had 90,000 Florida fans screaming, pointing and yelling obscenities at him. One guy even tried to torment Kiffin with a poster of Oakland Raiders owner Al Davis, Kiffin's former boss. Kiffin said afterward that his plan from Day 1 was to take the focus of his players and put it on him. \\"It worked perfectly,\\" Kiffin said. \\"It took all the pressure off the players. We played the No. 1 team in the nation with no pressure on them. ... It was all on me. We were 30-point underdogs in this place and it really helped them go out and play ball.\\" Kiffin refused to claim a moral victory, though. So singing \\"Rocky Top\\" will have to wait at least another year. He didn't even consider humming the tune. \\"No, we lost a game,\\" Kiffin said. \\"Maybe I'll come back here for basketball and sing it for [coach] Bruce [Pearl].\\" Florida's postgame celebration was about as conservative as its game plan. There was no trash talk and no one trying to rub it in. The Gators were clearly disappointed with their performance, even though they had reason to celebrate. Tebow, return man Brandon James and Florida's defense gave the Vols fits for the third straight year. Tebow completed 14 of 19 passes for 115 yards, although he also had two turnovers that Tennessee turned into 10 points. James returned three kickoffs for 97 yards, helping set up Florida's first 13 points, but he also dropped a pass in the end zone. And the defense harassed Jonathan Crompton and twice held the Vols to short field goals when they were in position for touchdowns. Ahmad Black intercepted Crompton on fourth down with about 2 minutes to play, ending Tennessee's last chance at pulling off the upset. \\"I'm not happy,\\" said Crompton, who threw three interceptions and fumbled a snap last week against UCLA. \\"Don't want to lose if you're a competitor. Hate losing more than you like winning. Look at the positives. Got a chance to capitalize early and late.\\" Tebow took over down the stretch. After his two nifty, 4-yard runs, the Gators looked like they would put the game away. But Tebow fumbled at the Vols 4, and Tennessee scored seven plays later to make it 23–13. It was Tebow's second turnover of the game. He threw an interception in the first half that Tennessee turned into a field goal. The Gators had some excuses for their lackluster offense. Receiver Deonte Thompson missed the game because of a hamstring injury. Running back Jeff Demps played with a 101-degree fever. And tight end Aaron Hernandez had to be isolated Friday because of flu-like symptoms. Meyer put it all on Tebow, who ran 24 times. His best plays were short gains late. He started right on a third-and-3, looked to throw and then cut back left and headed toward the sideline. He eluded Wes Brown's grasp, then tiptoed down the sideline for a 4-yard gain. Instead of possibly being forced to punt, the Gators scored a touchdown to make it 23–6. \\"Unbelievable,\\" Meyer said. \\"Vintage Tebow. He had a hell of a day. ... He kind of took that game over on that drive. That was one of the best plays. I can't wait to see that on film. He was this far from out of bounds and got the first down.\\" On the next possession, Tebow used a nasty spin move to escape All-American safety Berry and Gerald Williams, then hit Dennis Rogan so hard the defender's helmet flew off. \\"I don't think he's human,\\" Kiffin said. \\"I really don't. There were times when I asked [the coaches in the booth] on the headset, 'Is he ever going to wear down?' But he never does. Our defense worked hard and you just prayed to get it to third- and-4, because if it was third-and-3, he was going to put his head down and run over people.\\" Tebow and the Gators had their heads down afterward. Meyer even said he had to lighten the mood in the locker room. \\"I think there's so much pressure on this team to perform perfectly, which is good,\\" Meyer said. \\"I'd rather be on that end than on, 'Boy, great job. We lost by 10.' I don't want to do that. There's a lot of pressure on these guys and I felt it in there.\\" Florida went on to go 13–1 and finish #3 in the final AP poll. ===Ohio=== Jonathan Crompton threw for two touchdowns as Tennessee turned to its unsteady passing game to beat Ohio 34–23 Saturday night. Crompton threw a 26-yard screen pass to Bryce Brown to give the Vols (2–2) a 31–20 lead with 2:38 in the third quarter and lobbed a 3-yard scoring strike to Brandon Warren at the end of the first. With a stable of tough running backs, the Vols relied on their strong running game in their first three games to protect the turnover-prone passing game. Against the Bobcats, they rushed for 177 yards while Crompton completed 17 of 34 passes for 222 yards. Ohio (2–2) kept Tennessee uncomfortable by taking advantage of mistakes and passing for 319 yards against a Vols defense that entered the game allowing an average 88.33 yards by air per game. Crompton threw his eighth interception of the season to Noah Keller, who returned it 10 yards to the Tennessee 30. Theo Scott connected with LaVon Brazill on a 2-yard touchdown pass four plays later, giving the Bobcats a 14–7 lead with 7:08 in the first quarter. Scott finished 30-for-52. Brazill had 92 yards on eight catches, and Taylor Price added 90 yards on four catches. Chris Garrett took advantage of the Vols' poor special teams coverage and returned a kickoff 95 yards for a touchdown. Tennessee, which entered the game ranked fifth in total defense in the FBS, held the Bobcats to only 21 yards rushing on 17 carries. The Vols were also strong on the ground on offense. Montario Hardesty ran 20 times for 140 yards and an 11-yard touchdown and now has 1,531 career yards rushing. Bryce Brown added 56 yards rushing and caught two passes for 60 yards, including a 34-yard catch on the second play of the game. Tennessee will have a tough time regrouping before facing Auburn at home next week with several Vols leaving the game because of injury. Coach Lane Kiffin said starting middle linebacker Nick Reveiz was likely lost for the season after taking a hard hit on his right knee. Even though rain earlier in the day kept the attendance at Neyland Stadium down, the 95,535 in attendance made up the second-largest crowd in Ohio's history. Ohio went on to go 9–5 and finish 1st in the Eastern Division of the MAC Conference. ===Auburn=== Auburn took a big step under first-year coach Gene Chizik, winning on the road against a top-notch defense. Chris Todd threw for 218 yards and a touchdown, and Ben Tate ran for 128 yards and a score to help the Tigers beat Tennessee 26–22 and jumped out to their first 5–0 start since 2006 on Saturday night. \\"This one of those old-school, physical SEC games and we did a good job executing most of the night,\\" Chizik said. Auburn (5–0, 2–0 Southeastern Conference), which came from behind in its other four games this season, never trailed in its first road game of the season and has now won five straight over the Vols – its longest streak in the series. Tennessee (2–3, 0–2) isn't faring nearly as well in its rebuilding efforts under new coach Lane Kiffin. The Tigers met some resistance early from Tennessee's defense, but slowly wore it down as they held the ball nearly 10 minutes longer than the Vols. Auburn's third-ranked offense racked up 459 yards. \\"They are so complicated,\\" Kiffin said. \\"There are so many things they do.\\" Tennessee made the score look closer when Jonathan Crompton threw a 32-yard touchdown pass to Denarius Moore as the clock expired to cut the final margin to 26–22. No extra point was attempted. The Vols defense, which entered the game ranked eighth in the Football Bowl Subdivision, forced the Tigers to punt six times and limited them to field goals by Wes Byrum on four drives. The Auburn offense entered the game averaging 45.3 points and 526.3 yards and ranked third in the FBS. \\"We're trying to prove something every time we hit the field,\\" Auburn fullback Mario Fannin said. \\"We know what we have in mind, and that's a championship. We're just going to keep pushing forward and get better every week.\\" Tennessee's offense couldn't stay on the field. The Vols went three-and-out three times in the first half, and Crompton fumbled a snap at the Vols 30 on the first play of a first-quarter drive. The Vols converted only four of 17 third downs. By the middle of the second quarter, Auburn managed to take advantage of the weary Vols defense and drove 87 yards in 2:32. Tate scored on an 11-yard run to put the Tigers up 13–0 with 8:07 left before halftime. The Tigers again drove easily on the Vols on a 70-yard drive in the fourth quarter, and Todd connected with Terrell Zachery on an 11-yard touchdown pass to give them a 23–6 lead. Crompton managed to miss his receivers in every way possible: He overthrew, underthrew and hit them in the head and at the feet. He also didn't get any help from his targets, who dropped several passes that were accurately thrown. At halftime, Crompton had completed only four passes for 62 yards. Still, thanks to some success in the Vols' 2-minute offense, he finished 20 for 43 for 259 yards and two touchdowns. \\"There were drops. It was bad. There was no rhythm,\\" Kiffin said. \\"We're not good enough to overcome drops. You start adding those drops in, and we're going to struggle.\\" Todd, who completed 19 of his 32 attempts, had his choice of receivers, completing passes to eight different targets. The Tennessee defense was noticeably frustrated, and defensive end Chris Walker and tackle Wes Brown spoke to the entire team in a huddle at the sideline after Tate's touchdown run. \\"We have to make those plays because the defense was on the field a lot of time in the first half, and that goes somewhat on us,\\" Hardesty said. \\"We've got to stay on the field on third downs. We've got to keep drives going.\\" Auburn went on to go 8–5 and finish tied for 4th in the Western Division of the Southeastern Conference. ===Georgia=== Tennessee coach Lane Kiffin didn't defeat Florida as promised. He did deliver on another guarantee with a 45–19 win over the Georgia Bulldogs on Saturday. \\"[Kiffin] basically made a promise to us that we wouldn't lose to them anymore, forever or until he leaves,\\" Volunteers safety Eric Berry said. \\"He's not going to let Georgia beat us.\\" The first-year coach got some help from Jonathan Crompton, who passed for a career-high 310 yards and threw for four touchdowns. Kiffin had emphasized the Georgia game to his players due to its importance in recruiting. Because the state of Tennessee doesn't produce many elite prospects, coaches traditionally have recruited in Georgia, and 12 current Vols hail from the bordering state – including Berry. \\"I told the guys last night, I don't know all the Tennessee history or tradition of all the matchups,\\" Kiffin said. \\"There are a lot of great teams in this conference. But I told them, to me, this is the biggest matchup.\\" It was his first Southeastern Conference victory and kept the Volunteers (3–3, 1–2) from going 0–3 in the league for a second season in a row. Georgia (3–3, 2–2) dropped to 3–3 for the first time under coach Mark Richt. \\"They played better. They coached better. It's very obvious their team was a better team by a long shot,\\" Richt said. The Vols' passing game had faltered at times this season, with Crompton struggling with his accuracy and his receivers often dropping passes when he was on target. But by halftime Saturday, Crompton had already thrown for 205 yards and three touchdowns. He finished 20-for-27. Georgia's offense never reached the red zone, and the Tennessee defense held it to 241 yards compared with the Vols' 472. The Bulldogs found other ways to put up points. Brandon Boykin scored on his second 100-yard kickoff return of the season, and Bacarri Rambo returned Crompton's interception 28 yards for a TD. Blair Walsh kicked a 52-yard field goal, and Zach Renner blocked a punt by Chad Cunningham that sailed through the end zone for a safety. \\"I don't know that I've ever been involved in a game where the defense didn't let a team into the red zone one time,\\" Kiffin said. Crompton was a perfect 4-for-4 for 67 yards on a drive late in the first half, finding Marsalis Teague on a 5-yard touchdown pass for a 21–10 lead with 2:40 left. He also connected with Gerald Jones on a 51-yard score, the Vols' longest pass of the season. Despite being Tennessee's most productive receiver returning from last season, Jones had struggled with drops and mistakes while recovering from an ankle injury and wrist surgery. He had a season-best 105 yards receiving and two touchdowns. It was Georgia's Joe Cox who played the role of struggling quarterback. Cox finished 19-for-34 with 146 yards and no touchdowns. On the opening drive of the third quarter, Cox fumbled a snap, recovered and threw to Tennessee's Dennis Rogan while under pressure. The interception set up a 30-yard field goal by Daniel Lincoln to give the Vols a 24–12 lead. \\"It's so frustrating to come out and have so many things go wrong,\\" Cox said. \\"It's embarrassing. We are not doing the things we need to do as players.\\" The SEC's leading receiver, Georgia's A. J. Green, finished with only 60 yards on eight catches. Its leading rusher, Tennessee's Montario Hardesty, had 97 yards on the ground and a touchdown. Richt opened his career by winning four out of his first five meetings with Tennessee, but the Vols have won three of the last four. The game has often been one of the SEC East's premier matchups, but for the first time in 38 meetings neither team was ranked coming in. \\"We've got a long way to go to become a good football team,\\" Richt said. Georgia went on to go 8–5 and finish tied for 2nd in the Eastern Division of the Southeastern Conference. ===Alabama=== Mount Cody kept Alabama (No. 2 BCS, No. 1 AP) perfect with a pair of super-sized plays. Terrence Cody, the Crimson Tide's 350-pound nose guard, blocked a 44-yard field-goal attempt on the final play – his second block of the fourth quarter – and Alabama escaped with a 12–10 victory over rival Tennessee on Saturday. He muscled the Tide to another win, with pure brute force. \\"I didn't really get off the ground,\\" Cody said. \\"I just reached my arm up. That's how I got it. I knocked [the blocker] back. He was on his back.\\" Alabama (8–0, 5–0 Southeastern Conference) was about to have its bid for perfection knocked down, too. Then Cody broke through the line on the last play and practically ran into Daniel Lincoln's low kick. Relieved Alabama fans chanted \\"Cody!\\" as the All-American ambled toward the locker room. Leigh Tiffin booted four field goals – including a 50-yarder and a 49-yarder – to provide all Alabama's points and the Tide survived Mark Ingram's first college fumble and some problems for the nation's top defense. The last few minutes were all about survival – much like in then-No. 1 Florida's squeaker over Arkansas last week. \\"You talk about how fragile a season is,\\" Tide coach Nick Saban said. \\"You're controlling a game, even though you may say it's winning ugly. We're still ahead 12–3 and totally controlling the game with 3 minutes, 29 seconds and the ball. That's how fragile a season can be. You make one mistake and you have to go overcome it. I hope that there's a lot of lessons our team can learn from this.\\" His team gets some time to absorb them with an open date before No. 9 LSU visits. Tennessee (3–4, 1–3) kept alive its hopes for coach Lane Kiffin's first huge victory with Eric Berry's fumble recovery and Jonathan Crompton's 11-yard touchdown pass to Gerald Jones with 1:19 left. Then Tennessee's Denarius Moore recovered the onside kick at the Vols' 41 with no time outs remaining. Crompton hit Jones on a 14-yarder before Tennessee was pushed back by a false start. On second down, the much-maligned Crompton hit Luke Stocker for a 23-yard gain to get the Vols into position for the potential game-winning kick. But Cody and the Tide made a big push, and Alabama, second in the BCS standings, still controls its destiny in the national title race. \\"It's a difficult loss to deal with,\\" Kiffin said. \\"You come into a hostile environment and play the No. 1 team in the country, as I said before by far the No. 1 team in the country and the best-coached team around. You come in here and outgain them by [nearly] 100 yards and miss three field goals. \\"I don't believe in moral victories, we should have won that game.\\" He said Lincoln hasn't regained his leg strength since a quadriceps injury. \\"He can't kick the ball up high,\\" Kiffin said. \\"If you kick the ball up high it's never going to get there, so we can't allow the penetration up front.\\" Tiffin's 49-yarder with 6:31 left had barely cleared the uprights for the 12–3 lead and, it turns out, the decisive points. That came after Cody batted Lincoln's 43-yard field goal attempt with his left hand. \\"Neither was an exceptionally good kick, but they both went through and that's what counts,\\" Tiffin said. \\"I don't know if I watched either one of them go through.\\" Tennessee would get new life when Ingram lost the first fumble of his career in 322 touches, giving the Vols the ball back at the Bama 43. All-American safety Eric Berry jarred the ball loose as Ingram was going down, and then recovered it. Crompton overcame a sack on the first play and completed 4-of-4 passes for 42 yards and the TD to make it 12–10. Alabama had nearly made it three games in a row without allowing a touchdown. The Volunteers now have tested two No. 1 teams. They lost 23–13 to then-No. 1 Florida earlier and Kiffin's team came even closer this time. Tennessee was unranked the last time it beat an AP No. 1, topping Auburn 38–20 in 1985. \\"On the sideline, we just knew we were going to win in those last 4 seconds,\\" Stocker said. \\"I don't think there are enough words to explain how we feel. We are just speechless.\\" Alabama was held without an offensive touchdown for the first time since the Mississippi State game in 2007. The Vols outgained Alabama 341–256 and Crompton outplayed the Tide's Greg McElroy. He was 21 of 36 passing for 265 yards with an early interception. McElroy's 18 of 29 produced only 120 yards. Ingram, who emerged as a Heisman Trophy contender the past two weeks gained 99 yards on 18 carries and surpassed 1,000 yards on the season. After Cody's first block, McElroy passed for a first down and ran for another to move the Tide in position for Tiffin's field goal that made it a two-score game. After a roughing the punter on Tennessee, Alabama was in position to milk the clock and secure the victory. But the normally sure-handed Ingram gave the Vols another shot. Tennessee got close, but Mount Cody was ultimately too big to kick over. Alabama went on to go 14–0 and win the BCS National Championship game over Texas. ===South Carolina=== Lane Kiffin gave his players a treat, letting Tennessee wear black jerseys for the first time in 87 years. The Volunteers thanked their coach with a resounding victory. Decked out in black jerseys for the first time since adopting orange tops in 1922, Tennessee turned three South Carolina fumbles into touchdowns and beat the Gamecocks (No. 22 BCS, No. 21 AP) 31–13 Saturday night. \\"It's a players' game, and our players had been begging for them for a while,\\" said Kiffin, who got his first win over a ranked foe. \\"I think it gave us some energy. I think you saw that in the way they came out and played early.\\" Captains Eric Berry and Montario Hardesty approached athletic director Mike Hamilton on Wednesday, asking to wear an all-black uniform. A local Knoxville company quickly produced the black jerseys with orange numbers. Black pants couldn't be completed in time, so the Vols opted for orange bottoms. And how's this for a twist: Tennessee helped Florida. The Gators clinched the SEC East and a spot in the conference title game when the rival Vols beat South Carolina. After warming up in their traditional orange home jerseys, the Vols (4–4, 2/3 Southeastern Conference) seemed to take the Gamecocks by surprise as they took the field in Halloween- inspired uniforms. \\"The guys were excited and I think it gave us a little extra excitement and had us ready to play,\\" Vols defensive tackle Dan Williams said. Jonathan Crompton threw two touchdowns, Hardesty ran for two more and Rico McCoy forced two fumbles. South Carolina (6–3, 3–3) fumbled on its first two drives on a rainy night, having entered the game with only five for the season. Tennessee, hampered by turnovers early in the season, did not give the ball away for the first time this season. The Gamecocks began clicking on offense in the second half as the Vols sputtered. Stephen Garcia connected with Moe Brown on a 31-yard touchdown pass to cut the margin to 28–13 with 2:05 left in the third quarter, but it was too little too late. South Carolina outgained Tennessee on offense 365 yards to 341 and had four more first downs. Garcia completed 25 of 50 for 300 yards and an interception. Justice Cunningham coughed up the first fumble on the third play of the game, and 42 seconds later Crompton hit Austin Johnson on a 38-yard touchdown toss. Crompton completed 12 of 24 for 142 yards. On the second play of the following drive, Kenny Miles lost the first fumble of his career, and Tennessee answered with a 14-yard run by Hardesty, who finished with 121 yards rushing. \\"We had two fumbles in five plays, and it's hard to beat a team when you spot them those points,\\" Garcia said. Even when they weren't fumbling, the Gamecocks couldn't find much offense in the first half. They first made it to Tennessee territory with 9:29 left in the second quarter but stalled at the Vols 47. An illegal block by D.J. Swearinger cost South Carolina a 73-yard punt return for a touchdown by Stephon Gilmore. The Gamecocks drove 55 yards before halftime, but on third-and-3 at the Tennessee 25, Willie Bohannon dropped Miles for a 5-yard loss. Spencer Lanning kicked a career-long 47-yard field goal to cut the margin to 21–3 at the half. Tennessee's woes on special teams continued. With Daniel Lincoln sidelined by a quadriceps injury, Chad Cunningham took over field goal duties. Lincoln had two field goals blocked in a 12–10 loss last week at Alabama, including what would have been a game-winning 44-yard shot at the end of the game. Devin Taylor blocked Cunningham's first attempt, a 40-yarder in the first quarter. His second attempt, a 39-yarder with 4:23 left in the game, was good and drew a huge cheer from what was left of the Tennessee crowd. Up 14–0 early in the second quarter, Kiffin opted to go for it on fourth-and-goal at the 2-yard line rather than attempt a field goal. Crompton found Kevin Cooper, who stumbled into the corner of the end zone. The last time the Gamecocks were ranked as high as No. 21 was before the 2007 Tennessee game, when they were ranked No. 15. South Carolina – which has never won consecutive games in the Tennessee series and only won in Knoxville once – lost that game in overtime 27–24. \\"Like I told the guys, if we want to win some of these games against good teams, we've got to play well,\\" South Carolina coach Steve Spurrier said. \\"We had turnovers, had a punt return called back, had some opportunities here and there, but we didn't execute.\\" South Carolina went on to go 7–6 and finish tied for 4th in the Eastern Division of the Southeastern Conference. ===Memphis=== Jonathan Crompton threw for a career-high 331 yards and five touchdowns and ran for another as Tennessee routed Memphis 56–28 on Saturday night. Crompton surpassed his career high of 310 yards with a 10-yard pass to Denarius Moore on Tennessee's first drive of the second half. He tied his career high of five touchdown passes on the next play with a 16-yard connection to Moore to make it 49–7 with 12:38 left in the third quarter. Crompton finished 21-for-27 and no interceptions and was replaced by backup Nick Stephens halfway through the third quarter. Tennessee (5–4) gave coach Lane Kiffin his first winning streak and dominated the game much as it's done the series. The Vols hold a 21–1 advantage against Memphis and have won all 12 meetings in Knoxville. But the games between the state rivals often have been closer than the record indicates. Six of the 10 meetings between the two teams since 1991 have been decided by fewer than two touchdowns. David Oku took the opening kickoff 69 yards, and Bryce Brown scored on a 1-yard run 2 minutes later. Memphis (2–7) could do nothing to catch up. The Vols never punted with Crompton in the game, though they turned the ball over when they couldn't convert a fourth-and-2 at the Tigers' 29 and when Dennis Rogan muffed a punt return. Memphis drove 93 yards in its 2-minute offense and scored on a 36-yard run by Marcus Hightower to cut Tennessee's lead to 35–7 with 58 seconds left in the half. The Vols responded with a 55-yard drive and Crompton's 1-yard touchdown run with 4 seconds on the clock. The Tigers have been hampered with injuries this season, and it especially showed on defense. The Vols had their way passing nearly the entire game with wide-open routes. Crompton, who until a few games ago was more likely to throw interceptions than touchdowns, had his selection of scoring targets in Moore, Gerald Jones, Luke Stocker, Quintin Hancock and Nu'Keese Richardson. Stephens also hit Moore for a TD. Jones led the receiving corps with 97 yards on four catches. Crompton was only 5 yards and a TD pass short of tying his previous career high at halftime. By the break, Tennessee had outgained Memphis 382 yards to 104 and had gained 11 more first downs. Memphis entered the game with the 100th-ranked defense, giving up an average 416.5 yards. Tennessee finished with 566 yards. The Vols rank 13th in the nation in defense, but were playing second- and third-string players by the time Curtis Steele scored on a 1-yard run and again on a 3-yard run in the middle of the third quarter. The scores cut Tennessee's margin to 49–21. Steele finished with 144 yards on 21 carries in addition to the two touchdowns. Will Hudgens was 19 of 31 for 194 yards and an interception. Tennessee's Eric Berry, the Southeastern Conference's career interception return leader, inched closer to the NCAA career record when he picked off Hudgens and returned the ball 7 yards. Berry has 494 career return yards, 5 yards shy of Florida State's Terrell Buckley. Memphis went on to go 2–10 and finish last in the Eastern Division of Conference USA. ===Mississippi=== Dexter McCluster says being 5-foot-9 and 170 pounds has its advantages on the football field. No Tennessee defender could argue with the Mississippi standout Saturday. McCluster rushed for 282 yards and finished with 324 all- purpose yards, setting two Mississippi records, and the Rebels ran over the Volunteers 42–17. He broke the Rebels' single-game rushing record of 242 by Dou Innocent in 1995. He eclipsed the all-purpose mark of 317 yards by Deuce McAllister in 1999. \\"My size works to my advantage,\\" McCluster said. \\"When they see me, it's too late.\\" McCluster scored on runs of 15, 23, 32 and 71 yards in Ole Miss' first win against the Volunteers since 1983. \\"For 170 pounds he is special,\\" said Ole Miss coach Houston Nutt. \\"He can make the first one miss. He has game breaking speed. Hs you can see, he won't just run out of bounds on a long run. He'll cut back against the grain and separate to get into the end zone.\\" It's the most rushing yards given up by the Volunteers. Tennessee had yielded 217 yards to Colorado's Mike Pritchard in 1990 and Alabama's Bobby Humphrey in 1986. \\"We didn't have a way to tackle him,\\" Tennessee coach Lane Kiffin said. \\"He set a school record for rushing yards, and we probably set a record for missed tackles.\\" Ole Miss (7–3, 3–3 Southeastern Conference) – off to its best start since 2003 – clinched bowl eligibility for the second straight year with the victory. Tennessee (5–5, 2–4) was without three of their celebrated freshmen – wide receiver Nu'Keese Richardson, safety Janzen Jackson and defensive back Mike Edwards. The trio was arrested early Thursday morning for attempted armed robbery in Knoxville. McCluster scored his first touchdown just 1:31 into the game and added another with 1:20 left in the opening quarter. His 32-yard scamper came in the third quarter and Ole Miss opened the fourth quarter with McCluster's 71-yarder. \\"It was a big challenge to cover him,\\" said Tennessee defensive end Chris Walker. \\"We had to know where he was at all times and he lines up at wide receiver and he lines up at tailback, so it was really hard to adjust to that.\\" Brandon Bolden added 46 rushing yards and two touchdowns for the Rebels, who finished with 492 yards of total offense, including 359 on the ground. It was former Ole Miss coach Ed Orgeron's first return to Oxford since he was fired in November 2007 after three seasons. In his first year at Tennessee as defensive line coach the Vols have improved, but struggled against the Rebels. Jevan Snead, who was 13 of 20 passes for 133 yards, was sacked only once. Jonathan Compton finished 20 of 37 for 176 yards and two Tennessee touchdowns. He hit Jeff Cottam with a 16-yard TD in the first quarter and Denarius Moore with a 25-yarder in the second quarter. But the Vols' offense never got untracked, gaining just 275 yards over all, 99 on the ground. Their only other score was a 27-yard field goal by Daniel Lincoln in the third quarter. Ole Miss went on to go 9–4 and finish 3rd in the Western Division of Southeastern Conference. ===Vanderbilt=== Tennessee coach Lane Kiffin has had to reach so far down his depth chart because of injuries that even he wasn't sure who was on the field. The Volunteers beat in-state rival Vanderbilt 31–16 on Saturday night playing with a third-string middle linebacker, a walk-on outside linebacker and walk- on placekicker Devin Mathis. \\"That's the kicker, right?\\" Kiffin quipped when asked about Mathis. After missing the postseason last year, the battered Volunteers (6–5, 3–4 Southeastern Conference) became bowl eligible with the victory. Tennessee hasn't missed out on a bowl game in consecutive seasons since 1977–78. The Commodores (2–10, 0–8) finished without a conference win for the first time since 2002. Tennessee entered halftime with the momentum, but Vanderbilt had plenty of chances to take advantage of a Vols defense fielding inexperience players and guys like senior linebacker Rico McCoy, determined to play despite having an injured knee. \\"We just couldn't take advantage of some opportunities,\\" Vandy coach Bobby Johnson said. \\"It's a tough way to end the season.\\" The Commodores had a chance to tie the game before halftime but stalled on fourth-and-2 at the Tennessee 38 with 51 seconds left. Instead, Tennessee drove for a quick touchdown to go up 24–10. Vandy's Steven Stone was called for a 15-yard roughing the passer penalty, and Jonathan Crompton was perfect on four pass attempts. His 16-yard TD pass to Luke Stocker capped the 30-second drive. \\"That was a big momentum shift,\\" Vanderbilt linebacker Chris Marve said. \\"That just put us down even further, so we had to come out for the second half with an ever larger deficit.\\" Crompton finished 20-for-34 for 221 yards, two touchdowns and an interception. Montario Hardesty ran for a career-high 171 yards and a touchdown. The Vols struggled to move the ball in the second half, and Vanderbilt had a shot to pull within four points with about 6 minutes left. On third-and-goal at the 3, MacKenzi Adams attempted a pass for John Cole in the end zone. The ball bounced off Cole and into the hands of Tennessee's Dennis Rogan, but a pass interference call on Rogan kept the Commodores' drive alive. With a fresh set of downs, Vanderbilt couldn't move the ball, and Adams took a sack for a loss of 9 yards. Ryan Fowler kicked a 32-yard field goal to make the score 24–16 with 2:54 left, and the Commodores couldn't pull any closer. Adams was 19-of-35 for 174 yards, a touchdown and an interception. Vandy's Warren Norman had 73 yards rushing and 61 yards on kickoff returns. Norman's 1,923 all- purpose yards broke Herschel Walker's SEC freshman record of 1,805. He also became the Commodores' single-season leader for all-purpose yards. \\"It doesn't mean too much to me because I'm not about breaking records,\\" Norman said. \\"It's an honor though, just being mentioned with Herschel Walker. That's pretty cool.\\" Crompton's third-quarter interception ended a streak of 142 straight pass attempts without one, one shy of Casey Clausen's school record of 143. After struggling to find consistency on field goals with an injured Daniel Lincoln and punter Chad Cunningham, Tennessee called on Mathis for the first time this week. Mathis hit a 25-yard field goal and connected on three extra point attempts. Mathis was a walk-on last season and nearly earned a starting job as Lincoln struggled. He spent the spring semester studying in Mexico and did not participate in the Vols' fall camp. Tennessee finished its senior day in style when senior defensive tackle Wes Brown, who's played with injured knees for the past two seasons, intercepted Adams' pass and ran 25 yards for a touchdown with 3 seconds left, carrying Norman on his back for the last 5. His teammates piled on top of him in the end zone. \\"Everybody was saying, 'That might have been the ugliest thing I've ever seen,'\\" Brown said. \\"I felt [Norman] hopping on my back, but I didn't want to be denied. I wanted to score, and I couldn't ask for a better ending.\\" Vanderbilt ended the season at 2–10 and finished last in the Eastern Division of Southeastern Conference. ===Kentucky=== Montario Hardesty ran for three touchdowns, including a 20-yard game winner in overtime, as Tennessee outlasted Kentucky 30–24 on Saturday night, the Volunteers' 25th straight victory against their border rivals. Hardesty, who also ran for a career-high 179 yards, scampered up the middle for the final score after Kentucky's Lones Seiber missed a 49-yard field goal in the Wildcats' overtime chance. Tennessee (7–5, 4–4 Southeastern Conference) made sure its streak of dominance over Kentucky (7–5, 3–5) didn't end in coach Lane Kiffin's first year on the job. The win also likely locked up a New Year's Day bowl for the Volunteers and clinched second place behind Florida in the SEC East. Kentucky forced overtime on a 33-yard field goal by Seiber, set up when Ashton Cobb knocked the ball out of the hands of Luke Stocker following a completion and the Wildcats recovered. Kentucky ended the season at 7–5 and finished fifth in the Eastern Division of Southeastern Conference. ===Virginia Tech (Chick-fil-A Bowl)=== Ryan Williams isn't keeping track of his records. \\"Someone eventually will break them anyway,\\" Virginia Tech's fantastic redshirt freshman running back said. Probably, but in just one season Williams has already made a quite an impression. He capped a brilliant debut season with a record-setting game, running for two touchdowns to power Virginia Tech (No. 11 BCS, No. 12 AP) past Tennessee 37–14 in the Chick-fil-A Bowl on Thursday night. \\"I just saw green,\\" said Williams of his two touchdown runs. \\"When I see green, I take advantage of it.\\" The Hokies (10–3) took the lead with a field goal in the final seconds of the first half and outscored Tennessee 20–0 in the second half on their way to a sixth straight 10-win season. The only team with a longer active streak is Texas with nine. Williams, a redshirt freshman, had 117 yards rushing to become Virginia Tech's single-season rushing leader with 1,655 yards. Williams also set Atlantic Coast Conference records with 21 rushing touchdowns and 22 total touchdowns this season but said \\"I really don't care about records.\\" The Hokies outrushed Tennessee (7–6) 229–5. \\"Ryan was something tonight, particularly at the start of the second half,\\" Virginia Tech coach Frank Beamer said. \\"We got after them good.\\" Tennessee's star running back, Montario Hardesty, could not keep up with Williams. The Volunteers' senior had 18 carries for 39 yards and a touchdown. \\"We got gassed; we got tired,\\" Tennessee defensive end Chris Walker said. \\"You could tell especially on defense we weren't making plays. \\"Ryan Williams is a really great player.\\" Tennessee quarterback Jonathan Crompton was taken to a local hospital after the game for precautionary reasons, according to a school spokesman. Crompton suffered an undisclosed injury late in the game. Vols junior safety Eric Berry confirmed after the game he will enter the NFL draft. Tennessee was hurt by two turnovers which led to 10 points for Virginia Tech, and a dropped pass that cost the Vols a touchdown. \\"For whatever reason, we didn't play well today,\\" Tennessee coach Lane Kiffin said. \\"I was surprised we weren't able to run the ball better.\\" Rashad Carmichael intercepted a pass by Crompton in the first quarter to set up Williams' first touchdown run. Crompton fumbled when sacked by Nekos Brown late in the fourth quarter. John Graves recovered at the Tennessee 13 to set up Matt Waldron's third field goal, a 22-yarder. Virginia Tech players dumped a cooler of water on Beamer seconds later. Virginia Tech fans in the sellout crowd of 73,777 cheered, and Beamer raised his fists in response. Williams sat out the fourth quarter after a left ankle sprain. Virginia Tech fans cheered when Williams left the trainer's table and ran on the sideline, but Beamer gave the fourth-quarter carries to Josh Oglesby and David Wilson. Wilson had a 3-yard touchdown run with 5:14 remaining. Williams passed Kevin Jones' school- record 1,647 yards rushing in 2003. North Carolina's Don McCauley held the ACC records with 19 rushing touchdowns and 21 total in 1970. Clemson's C.J. Spiller matched the total touchdown mark this season. Georgia Tech's Robert Lavette also rushed for 19 touchdowns in 1982. Williams passed Jones with his seventh carry of an eight-play touchdown drive in the third quarter. He had long runs of 21 and 32 yards in the drive before setting the record on a 6-yard run to the 3. Tyrod Taylor scored from the 1 for a 24–14 lead. He completed 10 of 17 passes for 201 yards with an interception. Crompton completed 15 of 26 passes for 235 yards with a touchdown and an interception. Waldron, who had a 21-yard field goal at the end of the first half, added a 46-yarder – the longest of his career – to push the lead to 27–14 early in the fourth quarter. Tennessee's had a chance to get back into it, but wide-open Denarius Moore dropped a deep pass from Crompton on the Vols' next drive. Kiffin said the play \\"really took the wind out of our sails.\\" Williams had two short touchdown runs to give the Hokies a 14–0 lead in the second quarter. Tennessee then responded. Hardesty ran through 301-pound defensive tackle Cordarrow Thompson's tackle for a 4-yard run to cap an 80-yard drive. Janzen Jackson's interception set up Crompton's 2-yard touchdown pass to Moore with 18 seconds remaining in the first half. Instead of running out the clock, Taylor threw from his 33 to Jarrett Boykin, who was stopped inside the Vols' 5 as the clock apparently expired. Tennessee players left the field but were summoned back as a video review showed Boykin's knee hit the ground with 2 seconds remaining. \\"I knew that there was time left looking at the clock when Boykin made the catch,\\" Taylor said. Waldron's 21-yard field goal gave Virginia Tech a 17–14 halftime lead. The Hokies, who won the Orange Bowl last season, have back-to-back bowl wins for the first time in school history. Virginia Tech ended the season at 10–3 and finished #10 in the final AP Poll. ==Controversy== On November 12, three freshman Vols players — safety Janzen Jackson, receiver Nu'Keese Richardson, and defensive back Mike Edwards — were arrested in Knoxville on charges of attempted armed robbery. Edwards and Richardson were permanently dismissed from the team on November 16. Jackson was reinstated after the charges were dropped and returned to the team for the November 28 game against Kentucky. ==2010 NFL Draft== The 2010 NFL Draft was held on April 22–24, 2010 at Radio City Music Hall in New York City.

Kirby also reached the quarter finals of the 1994 UK Matchplay, beating Cliff Lazarenko in the first round before losing to Jamie Harvey. Kirby made two more appearance at the World Championship in 1995 and 1996 but lost out in the group stages. He also played in three World Matchplays, losing in the first round in 1994 and 1996 to Phil Taylor. Kirby won his first round match in 1995 against Sean Downs before losing in the second round to John Lowe. Kirby then quietly disappeared from the sport but resurfaced in 2002, entering UK Open regionals. He then played in the 2003 UK Open, but lost in the Preliminary Round. In 2004, Kirby reached the quarter finals of the Irish Masters where he lost to Peter Manley. Kirby then returned to the UK Open the same year, reaching the third round where he lost to Colin Lloyd. He also reached the quarter finals of the Northern Ireland Open, a WDF ranked event. Kirby qualified for the 2005 World Grand Prix in Dublin. Despite a brave effort, he lost in the first round to then-reigning champion Lloyd. Good performances in the regional finals of the 2006 UK Open earned him a spot in the third round proper but lost to Andy Callaby.

Although it apparently aired solely on CTV affiliates, it is not clear whether the program was ever officially part of CTV's network schedule. The series used a loophole in CRTC regulations of the era, which allowed each station involved in the production of such a series to count it as a \\"local\\" program for the purposes of fulfilling its conditions of licence, even if the program did not contain local content on a weekly basis. Since production responsibilities were rotated among all stations, participation in Canada in View could thus dramatically reduce a given station's local production requirements. The CRTC announced in 1989 it would close the loophole for information and sports programming, which included Canada in View, though it provided a temporary reprieve for existing productions, but only until the end of participating stations' licence terms. In most cases this was August 1994, by which point the series had disappeared.Public Notice CRTC 1989-27, subsection 2(iv) Whether this decision directly led to the demise of the series is unclear; one columnist would later place the blame on Baton Broadcasting (at that time the largest CTV-affiliate ownership group) for pulling out of the series. ==References== Category:1988 Canadian television series debuts Category:1994 Canadian television series endings Category:1980s Canadian television news shows Category:1990s Canadian television news shows Category:CTV Television Network original programming Category:English-language television shows ","title":"Canada in View"},{"id":"20523749","text":"Larkin's Hill Farm is a historic home at Harwood, Anne Arundel County, Maryland, United States.

One of the sailing vessels is historically significant for bringing to the Hawaiian Islands in 1879 Portuguese immigrants who subsequently introduced the ukulele to island culture. ==Capt. Biggam's Ravenscrag== The best known of several similarly named ships, the Ravenscrag (spelled without the \\"i\\") is a British sailing vessel commanded by Capt. Biggam that on 23 August 1879 brought 419 Portuguese immigrants from Madeira to the Hawaiian Islands to work as contract laborers in the sugar plantations. The ship left the Madeiran port of Funchal on 23 April 1879 and took exactly four months to cross the Atlantic Ocean, round Cape Horn, and then sail across the Pacific to Honolulu. Among the passengers were Manuel Nunes, Augusto Dias, Jose do Espirito Santo, and Joao Fernandes, who are credited with introducing the ukulele to Hawaii. This was the second ship of Portuguese immigrants to reach the Islands, having been preceded on 30 September 1878 by the German bark . Though depicted in a U.S. Postal Service description of a 2004 commemorative stamp release as a wooden-hulled bark, the Ravenscrag was actually a 1,263 tons, long, iron-hulled, three-masted sailing ship with square sails on each mast (i.e., a clipper). It was commissioned by Scottish-Canadian shipping magnate Sir Hugh Allan for his Allan Shipping Line with freight service between Britain and the States, and named by Allan after his mansion in Montreal, which had been named, in turn, after Ravenscraig Castle in Scotland. The ship was built for Allan in 1866 by Robert Steele & Co. at their Cartsdyke shipyard in Greenock, Scotland (Yard No. 52), and owned by J. & A. Allan & Company of Glasgow, Scotland, an Allan Line subsidiary that was overseen by Sir Hugh's older brother James Allan. Biggam, still under the employ of the Allan Line, is shown as captain of the Ravenscrag in an 1885 trade journal, the same year the ship was sold to John Crow Richardson of Swansea, Wales. It was then sold in 1896 to F.G. Mabane of South Shields, England. Two years later the New York Times on 7 April 1898 reported that \\"the British ship Ravenscrag . . . has not arrived here (Callao, Peru) and is officially reported missing.\\" The article further states that the Ravenscrag was \\"an iron vessel, built at Greenock in 1893, hails from South Shields, Eng. and is owned by T.G. Mabano.\\" Allowing for misspellings and incorrect reporting of dates, this is clearly the same ship that Captain Biggam and 419 Portuguese immigrants sailed 19 years earlier to the Hawaiian Islands. Though feared lost a sea, the Ravenscrag did arrive at the port of Callao several days late, having been delayed by unusually strong currents while crossing the Atlantic. The Norwegian firm of Johanson Joh. & Co. of Oslo in 1901 purchased the Ravenscrag, and renamed it the SV Armenia. The ship at this time was still full rigged for sail, but the Norwegians subsequently rerigged it as a bark. The SV Armenia met its demise on 27 August 1907 when, while on a voyage from Rio de Janeiro to Glasgow to deliver lumber, it was attempting to put in at the port of Matane, Quebec in a thick fog, and ran aground at Capucins on the Quebec side of the St. Lawrence River. ==Rescue ship of the Polaris expedition== Perhaps the first ship to bear the name Ravenscraig (with an \\"i\\") was a 581 to 589 tons, long, wooden sailing ship, sheathed in copper, that was built in 1853 in South Shields, England, and owned by Lockart & Co. Though registered in Kirkcaldy, Scotland, it was employed initially in the Australian and New Zealand wool trade, and was still in service in 1865 when shipping agents Levin & Co. and Bethune & Hunter ran ads advertising passage from New Zealand to London. The Ravenscraig at some point was outfitted with a steam engine and converted to a whaling ship, which on 23–25 June 1873 was involved in the arctic rescue of the crew of the , which had been trying to reach the North Pole on an ill-fated expedition of the U.S. Navy. The official testimony of one of the rescued sailors describes the Ravenscraig as \\"a bark of about 400 tons [a rough estimate], with steam-power . . . [that] hailed from Kirkcaldie (Kirkcaldy), but sailed from Dundee.\\" The owner of this bark was Ninian Lockart, Esq. of Kirkcaldy, Scotland, whose firm of Lockart & Co. twenty years earlier in 1853 had first purchased the Ravenscraig. ==Other ships named Ravenscraig== Another ship named the SS Ravenscraig was a long, 2,301 tons steamship built in 1900 at Port Huron, Michigan as a bulk freighter by the Jenks Shipbuilding Company for hauling iron and copper ore on the Great Lakes. It was, in fact, the first ship launched from the company's new ship yard. The SS Ravenscraig was sold in 1907, and taken off the lakes. When it was sold again in 1917 it was renamed the Edward F. Cragin. It remained in service until 1923, when it was scrapped in Italy. There is also record of a long, 333 tons British steamship named the Ravenscraig that was built in 1899 and sank on 18 September 1932 in the English Channel, just off the mouth of the Thames River, during a collision with another steamship. A more recent ship to bear the name, one that was built about 1979, is a British, long, steel-hulled, bulk freighter that on 17 April 1989 helped rescue the crew of the cargo ship Star of Alexandria when it sank in the Atlantic Ocean about 400 miles southwest of Cape Cod. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Category:Victorian-era passenger ships of the United Kingdom Category:Portuguese immigration to Hawaii Category:1866 ships Category:Greenock Category:Ships built on the River Clyde Category:Polaris expedition ","title":"SS Ravenscrag"},{"id":"20523955","text":"Rev.

Found throughout the tropics, they have gained prominence as integrated pest management agents. ==Lifecycle== Larra wasps feed on nectar as adults. Female wasps hunt adult or late-instar mole crickets and lay their eggs upon them, first temporarily paralyzing them by stinging them on the underside. The larva, upon hatching, gradually consumes the host, eventually killing it. It then pupates in or near the remains. The adults are solitary and do not form colonies. Incubation and development are highly variable in length and dependent upon temperature; in winter, the larvae may enter diapause. Each Larra species preferentially hunts a particular set of prey species, even when related prey is available. The temporary paralysis of the host is a distinctive feature of the genus. Other related wasps generally paralyze the host permanently and bury it so that the larva can consume it undisturbed.

He is best known as the editor of the 5th edition of Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians (1954). ==Biography== Blom was born in Bern, Switzerland. His father was of Danish and British descent, and his mother was Swiss. He was educated in German-speaking Switzerland,Frank Howes, \\"Blom, Eric (Walter)\\" in Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 5th edition, Supplementary Volume, 1961 and later in England. He was largely self-taught in music. He started in music journalism by assisting Rosa Newmarch in writing program notes for Sir Henry J. Wood's Prom Concerts, which were notable for their abundance of accurate information. From 1923 to 1931 he was the London music correspondent for the Manchester Guardian. He then went to the Birmingham Post (1931–46), and returned to London in 1949, as music critic for The Observer. He retired as chief music critic for The Observer in 1953, but still wrote weekly contributions right up till his death. He was the editor of Music & Letters from 1937 to 1950, and again from 1954 until his death.encyclopedia.com He withdrew in 1950 because of his preoccupation with the preparation of Grove's Dictionary. He returned in 1954 only because the proprietor and then-editor, Richard Capell, died. In his capacity as musical adviser to the Dent publishing firm, he also edited the Master Musicians series, of which he wrote \\"Mozart\\". He discovered a number of young authors and gave them their first opportunities to write music biography. Eric Blom's first lexicographical work was Everyman's Dictionary of Music (1947), which went through several editions (it was revised in 1988 by D. Cummings as The New Everyman Dictionary of Music). He succeeded H. C. Colles as editor of Grove's Dictionary for the 5th edition (usually referred to as \\"Grove V\\"). Colles had confined the dictionary to five and six volumes for Grove III and IV respectively (1927, 1940). Blom expanded it to nine volumes for Grove V (1954). As well his overall editing responsibilities, Blom personally wrote hundreds of entries, including Arthur Sullivan.The Unperson of English Music He also translated many entries by foreign contributors (he was fluent in German, Danish, Italian and French as well as English). A Supplementary Volume was published in 1961, after Blom's death, but he had done most of the work on it. His introduction and acknowledgments were included, and he is credited as Editor, with Denis Stevens as Associate Editor. His own biography, written by Frank Howes (the chief music critic of The TimesMcBrayer thesis), appeared in the Supplementary Volume. Grove V was reprinted in 1966, 1968, 1970, 1973 and 1975, and remained the standard edition of Grove until the New Grove was released in 1980. Blom was forthright in his opinions. He could be almost gushing about his favourites, particularly Mozart, and most especially his operas. He wrote that Benjamin Britten's Peter Grimes was \\"so impressive and original that only the most absurd prejudice will keep it out of the great foreign opera houses\\". Equally, he did not shrink from criticising composers he thought less of, and introduced some of his own prejudices. He was capable of uniquely insightful comments on well-known works in which he held a minority opinion; e.g., that the solo part of the Sibelius Violin Concerto \\"is closely interwoven with the symphonic tissue, and is therefore neglected by the average virtuoso\\" (even though it is in fact one of the most popular and frequently played and recorded of all violin concertos). Even more notoriously, he wrote that Rachmaninoff \\"did not have the individuality of Taneyev or Medtner. Technically he was highly gifted, but also severely limited. His music is ... monotonous in texture ... The enormous popular success some few of Rakhmaninov's works had in his lifetime is not likely to last, and musicians never regarded it with much favour\\". To this, Harold C. Schonberg, New York critic not immune to snobbery of his own, in his Lives of the Great Composers, responded with equally outspoken unfairness, \\"It is one of the most outrageously snobbish and even stupid statements ever to be found in a work that is supposed to be an objective reference\\". Blom translated many documents for Otto Erich Deutsch's Mozart: A Documentary Biography (published 1965).Deutsch He assisted Gervase Hughes in the writing of his book The Music of Arthur Sullivan. In 1956, for the Mozart bicentenary, he published some of Mozart's letters translated by Emily Anderson. He died on 11 April 1959, and is interred at Golders Green Crematorium.Find-a-Grave He had requested that at his funeral, the organist play J.S. Bach's final chorale prelude Vor Deinen Thron tret' ich zu Dir (I step before Thy throne, O Lord). Unfortunately, 'Bach chorale' was misunderstood, and the laughably incongruous \\"Barcarolle\\" from Offenbach's The Tales of Hoffmann was played instead. ==Other writings== His other books include: * Stepchildren of Music (1923) * The Romance of the Piano (1927) * A General Index to Modern Musical Literature in the English Language (1927; this indexes periodicals for the years 1915–26) * The Limitations of Music (1928) * Mozart (1935; part of the Master Musicians series) * Beethoven's Pianoforte Sonatas Discussed (1938) * A Musical Postbag (1941; collected essays) * Music in England (1942; rev. 1947) * Some Great Composers (1944) * Classics, Major and Minor, with Some Other Musical Ruminations (London, 1958) * Translated Richard Specht's Johannes Brahms: Leben und Werk eines deutschen MeistersEric Blom at Goodreads * Translated Weissman's Music Come to Earth *Translated the libretto of Mozart's Die Entführung aus dem Serail, which he rendered as The Elopement from the Harem * Tchaikovsky Orchestral Works * Piano Music of Beethovenopen library * The Trouble Factory * The Music Lover's Miscellany * Schubert * Strauss: The Rose Cavalier * Diccionario de la Musica * Bach (The Mayfair Biographies)amazon.com * \\"Delius and America\\", in The Musical QuarterlyJSTOR * Blom contributed the article on Arthur Sullivan in the International Cyclopaedia of Music and Musicians (New York, 1939) * He revised H.

In the central part of the country, schools such as Manchester High School can expect to receive the best performing students from the annual GSAT exams, while in the west Cornwall College is the perpetrator, with Campion College in the east being the overall preferred institution of choice for all Jamaicans irrespective of geographic boundaries.

DrumCore has been used by TV composers for creating music for the Survivor series as well as the drums for a recent Debbie Harry album. ==Features== DrumCore 4 was developed for songwriters, composers, musicians and producers. An upgrade to the DrumCore 3 and KitCore 2 plug-in drum instruments, DrumCore 4 (AAX/AU/VST3) now works with many 64-bit recording software programs on Mac and Windows, and includes 24-bit audio loops, MIDI loops, multi-velocity sampled drum kits, groove browser, song timeline, mixer, effects and more. Royalty free recordings of celebrity drummers are provided as tempo-adjustable GrooveSets in a variety of styles. Users can either use the included GrooveSets, or create their own grooves using the included drum kits, which are MIDI-mapped and customizable, making DrumCore easy to use with external controllers. ;Famous drummer content DrumCore includes content by well-known drummers, including: Jeff Anthony (Sheryl Crow), John Bishop (Ernie Watts), Terry Bozzio (Missing Persons), Tony Braunagel (Bonnie Raitt), Luis Conte (Sergio Mendes), Ned Douglas (Dave Stewart), Sly Dunbar (Bob Marley), Michael Shrieve (Santana), Ben Smith (Heart), Matt Sorum (Velvet Revolver), DJ Syze-up (UltraNaté), Alan White (Yes, John Lennon), Lonnie Wilson (Brooks & Dunn), Zoro (Lenny Kravitz) and John Tempesta (Helmet, Testament, Rob Zombie). ;Audio and MIDI GrooveSets for songwriting A drummer plays the equivalent of a song with a basic groove, variations and fills. Then they often (but not always) play the song at multiple tempos that they feel that groove works at. In this way you get the same basic groove at multiple tempos and the performance sounds more realistic than simply using one performance and time stretching it to speed it up or slow it down. The content is offered as MIDI as well as stereo audio loops and the drummer's drumkit is sampled/recorded for use in DrumCore's virtual MIDI instrument. Songwriters can use these GrooveSets for writing, as they offer enough content to work on a song, which usually requires related beats and transitions to support a verse/chorus type of structure. ;MIDI drum instrument The DrumCore MIDI drum instrument contains the drum and percussion sounds used by the drummer. This is for primarily for playing the drummers' MIDI grooves but can also be used for creating new beats using the drummers' sounds and a MIDI program that works with VST3, AAX and AU plug-ins. ;Integration with other audio applications DrumCore easily integrates with popular plug-in hosts on Mac and Windows computers. Audio can be exported as WAV, AIFF or REX2, and MIDI grooves can be exported as standard MIDI files, simply by dragging and dropping them to a track. ;DrummerPack expansion packs Numerous expansion packs, known as DrummerPacks, are available on DrumCore.com.

Torres is a former government official, once acting assistant secretary of homeland security for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). He was appointed on November 17, 2008. ==Early career== Torres began his law enforcement career with the former Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) in 1986. During his time in the former INS, Torres played several key roles. Early in his career, Torres was a decorated member of a highly successful undercover investigative unit in Los Angeles. In 1992 during the Los Angeles riots, he was assigned to duty at the Newton and Rampart Divisions of the Los Angeles Police Department. In 1999, Torres was designated the INS investigative lead for the railway serial killer investigation of Rafael Resendez-Ramirez in Texas. In 1997, Torres was assigned to the FBI Headquarters International Terrorism Operations Section, and later designated as the first INS Special Agent in the Osama Bin Laden Unit. In that capacity, he managed investigations of the East Africa embassy bombings, the millennium attack plot to bomb the Los Angeles International Airport and other sites, the Khobar Towers attack, and the plot to bomb American airliners over the Pacific Ocean. Following the 9/11 attacks, Torres returned to Washington and was assigned to the subsequent investigation at FBI headquarters. In addition to being a key member of several investigations, Torres also developed the Law Enforcement Support Center in Burlington, Vermont, which has become an integral piece to coordination between ICE and other law enforcement agencies. ==Career at ICE== From March to November 2008, John Torres was the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Operations for U.S. ICE. In this capacity, Torres was responsible for coordinating the efforts of the Office of Federal Protective Service (FPS), the National Firearms and Tactical Training Unit, the National Incident Response Unit, the Office of Detention and Removal Operations (DRO), the Office of Intelligence, the Office of International Affairs, the Office of Investigations (OI), and the Office of State and Local Coordination. Torres worked to ensure the most effective collaboration between each of these operational components of ICE in an effort to achieve the stated goals of the agency, and to realize the most efficient use of the agency's resources toward that end. From June 2005 to March 2008, John Torres was the Director of the Office of Detention and Removal Operations for ICE within the Department of Homeland Security. In his capacity as Director, Torres oversaw an authorized workforce of more than 6,700 employees, including nearly 6,000 sworn law enforcement officers assigned to 24 field offices nationwide, managed an operating budget of over $2 billion, ended the practice of \\"catch and release\\" and transitioned the Criminal Alien Program from the Office of Investigations to DRO. In Fiscal Year 2007, DRO removed over 282,000 foreign nationals; eliminated more than 140,000 fugitive cases from the fugitive backlog; issued 164,296 charging documents through the Criminal Alien Program; and expanded detention capacity to 27,500 from 18,500 in Fiscal Year 2005. Torres previously served as Deputy Assistant Director for Smuggling and Public Safety in ICE Office of Investigations, where he oversaw the implementation of ICE's anti-gang initiative Operation Community Shield, the ICE Mutual Agreement between Government and Employers (IMAGE) program, and the establishment of ICE's Document and Benefit Fraud task forces. He previously served as the Special Agent-in-Charge of the Newark ICE office, where he oversaw ICE's participation in several major multi-agency investigations, including an international child pornography investigation resulting in the arrests of over 2,000 people; and an undercover investigation involving the purchase of surface-to-air missiles from arms brokers for the purpose of downing American airliners. ==External links== *U.S. Department of Homeland Security *Immigration and Customs Enforcement Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials Category:George W.

The club was established in 1985 as Ariake Football Club till they merged with Kunimi Football Club in 2005 and adopted the present name. The club gained promotion into the J. League Division 2 in 2012 for the first time in their history after finishing as the champions in the 2012 Japan Football League and hired Nagasaki native Takuya Takagi to coach the club for the 2013 season. On 11 November 2017, the club clinched promotion to the J1 League for the first time in their history after a 3-1 home win over Kamatamare Sanuki. ==History== V-Varen Nagasaki, since 2006, had been contending for the Kyūshū Soccer League championship and thus a place in the Japan Football League, but they only won it in November 2008, as second place in the Regional League promotion series. In January 2009, they applied for J. League Associate Membership and their application was accepted at the J. League board meeting in February. In 2012, they won the Japan Football League title and thus promotion to the J. League Division 2. Five years later they won promotion to the J1 League for the first time after finishing runners-up in the 2017 J2 League. ===J. League: 2013–=== In preparation for the club's first season in the J. League Division 2 the club hired local-born Takuya Takagi as their coach for the season. On 3 March 2013 V-Varen Nagasaki played in their first ever J. League Division 2 match against Fagiano Okayama at the Kanko Stadium in Okayama in which the club drew the match 1–1 with Kōichi Satō scoring the first J. League Division 2 goal for V-Varen Nagasaki in the 25th minute. The club then played their first home match in the J.

Donayre previously served as Commanding General of the Peruvian Army, commander of the Center Military Region, the Southern Military Region, and the 2nd Infantry Brigade. He assumed the role of commanding general on December 5, 2006, replacing General César Reinoso, who resigned amid accusations of corruption. During his tenure, Donayre was accused of corruption and obstructing inquiries into human rights violations. He was also at the center of an international controversy when a video surfaced in the media showing him making anti-Chilean remarks at a private party. He retired on December 5, 2008 and was replaced by General Otto Guibovich. == Military career == Edwin Donayre was born on January 8, 1952 in the city of Ayacucho in the highlands of Peru. He attended San Juan Bosco school, a Salesian institution in his hometown, and studied at a seminary for two years before studying two years of Chemical Engineering at the San Cristóbal of Huamanga University. Donayre's military career started at the Chorrillos Military School, where his first year grades earned him a scholarship to continue his formation in Argentina. At the National Military College in Buenos Aires he graduated with honors as a military engineer. In active duty Donayre has served four times in regions under state of emergency due to Shining Path guerrilla activity and five times in frontier regions. He has held several command posts, among them commander of the 20th Combat Engineer Battalion, director of the Army Engineer School, commander of the 2nd Infantry Brigade, commander of the Southern Military Region, and commander of the Central Military Region. Ejército del Perú, , 2006. Retrieved December 2, 2008. == Commanding General == Donayre's tenure as Commanding General of the army was controversial from the start due to corruption allegations and an international incident with Chile. Opposition leader Ollanta Humala criticized Donayre's designation as irregular because at that time he was not serving as general of any of the three major army divisions as stipulated by Peruvian law.Living in Peru, Opposition leader Humala slams Peruvian president over military shake up, December 6, 2006. Retrieved December 4, 2008. As commander of the Army, Donayre was also accused of acquiring 50,000 American-made MREs — military rations — to supply troops deployed against Shining Path guerrillas in the Apurímac and Ene river valleys, instead of acquiring cheaper, locally-made alternatives. An attempt to buy 50,000 more rations led to an inquiry by the Ministry of Defense.IPS, Peru: Something Fishy About Imported Military Rations , June 18, 2008. Retrieved December 4, 2008. The general's stance on human rights issues has also been quite controversial. It has been reported that he was behind the Army's refusal to provide any information on the 1984 Putis massacre. Requests issued on June 2008 by prosecutor Rubén López for a detailed report on the military personnel deployed there at that time were answered the following month by the Defense Ministry stating that the Army did not have any information on the subject in its archives.IPS, Peru: Military Wants to Keep Massacres Buried , September 18, 2008.

Donayre also joined a campaign to raise funds to defend armed forces personnel accused of committing human rights abuses during the internal conflict in Peru.IPS, Peru: Activists Warn of \\"Impunity Measures\\" , November 14, 2008. Retrieved December 5, 2008. == Political life == In 2011 he presented himself as a candidate to Congress representing the Ayacucho region; Although he received the highest vote in his region, he could not get the seat, since his Radical Change party was not able to get enough overall votes to pass the election threshold. In 2014, he would once again try his hand in Peruvian politics by being a candidate for the Regional Presidency of Ayacucho by the Alliance for Progress Ayacucho party. Donayre ended up with almost 28% of the votes, surpassed only by his opponent, Wilfredo Oscorima, who would obtain 32% of the vote. On July 28, 2016, Edwin Donayre was elected to the Congress of the Republic of Peru, representing the Ayacucho Region, running as independent within the Alliance for Progress party. == Corruption charges == According to a report by the army inspector general, Francisco Vargas, Donayre requested 80,000 gallons of fuel without clear justification when he was commander of the Southern Military Region, between January and September 2006, and diverted part of it to army headquarters in Lima. This led to an investigation by the anti-corruption prosecutor, Marlene Berrú, but, despite being summoned six times, Donayre did not show up at her office.IPS, Peru: Army Chief to Appear Before Anti-Corruption Prosecutor , November 18, 2008. Retrieved December 4, 2008. He finally attended her request on November 25, 2008; in his testimony he denied any wrongdoing and claimed that the Southern Military Region actually received less fuel under his command than in the previous year. Diario Correo, Donayre genera impasse con Chile, November 26, 2008. Retrieved December 5, 2008. On August 27, 2018, Donayre was found guilty (along with 40 people) of the crime of peculation in the case of fuel trafficking. the second liquidation room of the Court of Justice of Lima sentenced him to five years and six months of effective prison. The court requests the lifting of immunity since he was serving as a Congressman and thus had parliamentary immunity. On May 2, 2019, with 102 votes in favor, 0 against and 1 abstention, the request to lift Donayre's parliamentary immunity was approved by Congress. The judicial police went in search of the former soldier in his residence located in Santiago de Surco but was not found although his lawyer mentioned to the media that he would hand himself over to justice in the next few hours. He is still escaping justice. == International controversy == Donayre became the center of an international controversy on November 24, 2008, when Peruvian media showed a YouTube video in which the general said \\"We are not going to let Chileans pass by (...) [A] Chilean who enters will not leave. Or will leave in a coffin. And if there aren't sufficient coffins, there will be plastic bags\\". The video, dated to 2006 or 2007, was recorded during a party at a friend's house attended by army officials and civilians. These comments caused widespread indignation in Chile, making headlines in the El Mercurio newspaper. The Peruvian president, Alan García, called his Chilean counterpart, Michelle Bachelet, to explain that these remarks did not reflect official Peruvian policy. Bachelet declared herself satisfied with the explanations.CNN, Peru leader rejects top general's remarks on Chile, November 26, 2008. Retrieved December 3, 2008. On November 28, in response to this incident, a Chilean government spokesman stated that a scheduled visit to Chile by the Peruvian defense minister, Antero Flores Aráoz, might be inopportune given the circumstances. The following day, Flores Aráoz announced his decision to postpone his trip after conferring with the Foreign Affairs Minister, José Antonio García Belaúnde. Several members of the Peruvian government commented on the spokesman's remarks including president García who said the country \\"did not accept pressure or orders from anybody outside of Peru\\".Reuters, Peru leader rejects top general's remarks on Chile, November 29, 2008.

Donayre defended the video, declaring that Peruvian citizens have a right to say whatever they want at private gatherings and that even though he is scheduled to retire on December 5 he will not be forced to resign early under external pressure. As a consequence of these exchanges, tensions between Peru and Chile rose again; president Bachelet met with top aides on December 1 to discuss the matter and possible courses of action. Meanwhile, in Lima, Congressman Gustavo Espinoza became the center of attention as the main suspect of leaking the video to Chilean press and politicians.CNN, Chileans angry over Peru general's 'body bag' remark, December 1, 2008.

Meredith was chosen for the task because Cardinal Marotta wanted someone learned and meticulous; someone who might be lacking in charity, but not in precision. The residents of the nearby village of Gemello Maggiore are promoting Nerone's cult because it will bring prestige to the area. Meredith discovers that Nerone was in fact a deserter from the British army, who had an illegitimate son by a local woman, and was executed by Communist partisans towards the end of World War II, yet is a man revered in his small village. ==Development== Fluent in both French and Italian, West visited southern Italy in the 1950s, where he wrote the 1957 non-fiction Children of the Sun, which described the lives of street urchins in Naples.

Medicamina Faciei Femineae (Cosmetics for the Female Face, also known as The Art of Beauty) is a didactic poem written in elegiac couplets by the Roman poet Ovid. In the hundred extant verses, Ovid defends the use of cosmetics by Roman women and provides five recipes for facial treatments. ==Background== The title and approximate date of the poem are known from a brief mention in another of Ovid's works, Ars Amatoria, in the third book of which the poet states that he has already written \\"a small work, a little book\\" on medicamina, or cosmetics.Ovid Ars Amatoria 3.205–6 The Medicamina must then predate the third book of Ars Amatoria, a work whose composition has been variously placed between 1 BC and AD 8, the year of Ovid's exile. Only one hundred of an estimated five to eight hundred original lines survive. These fall neatly into sections, each exactly fifty lines long. The first section is an elaborate introduction in which Ovid introduces and defends his subject matter; the second comprises five recipes for cosmetic treatments which include common ingredients and precise measurements. ==Form== The poem is Ovid's first attempt at didactic elegy.Watson, p. 457 This poetic genre, perfected by Ovid in his Ars Amatoria, was a curious amalgam of the moralizing and pedagogical tone of didactic poetry and the frivolous subject matter common to Latin elegiac. In the earliest known example of didactic poetry, Works and Days, the Greek poet Hesiod admonishes a dissolute brother to lead a life of honest labor. Centuries later in 29 BC, the Roman poet Vergil, writing in Latin while taking his inspiration in part from Hesiod, published the Georgics, a work whose ostensible purpose was to provide advice on agriculture. Ovid, writing a generation later for an audience to whom the Georgics were well known, used Vergil's sober language to instruct girls on \\"what care can enhance your looks, and how your beauty may be preserved\\".Medicamina Faciei Femineae 1–2 Rather than using the dactylic hexameters of Hesiod and Vergil, Ovid casts his advice in elegiac couplets, the traditional meter of love poetry. The contrast of serious tone and light- hearted meter transforms the Medicamina Faciei Femineae into a parody of Vergil's Georgics.Watson, p. 471 ==Contents== In the second half of the Medicamina Faciei Femineae, Ovid displays his command of the poet's art in taking a practical manual replete with technical details and transforming it into effective verse.Watson, p. 470–1 Despite the facetious nature of the introduction, the five recipes included in the final 50 lines seem to be genuine, or at least plausible, cosmetic treatments. A representative example is a mixture of barley, vetch, egg, hartshorn, narcissus bulb, gum, Tuscan spelt, and honey.Medic. 53–66 Ovid promises that any woman who uses this concoction on her face \\"will shine smoother than her own mirror.\\"Medic. 67–8 The majority of the ingredients Ovid prescribes are in fact effective skin treatments, and several, such as oatmeal, wheat germ and egg white, are still used in the manufacture of cosmetics and pharmaceuticals today. On this point, Ovid contrasts favorably with the Roman natural philosopher Pliny the Elder, whose compendious treatment of facial remedies often includes exotic, poisonous, or disgusting ingredients.Green, pp. 390–1 ==NotesThe Art of Beauty, translated by J.

Prior to this position Schenkel was the director of the Federal Protective Service(FPS), one of the six divisions of the National Protection and Programs Directorate of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security from March 2007 until July 2010. FPS is the national law enforcement agency responsible for the General Service Agency's (GSA) inventory of over 9,000 buildings located in all 56 states, US territories and protectorates. A retired United States Marine Corps lieutenant colonel, Schenkel served in the enlisted ranks for 8 of his nearly 30 years of service. As an infantryman and infantry officer, he gained experience in a wide range of arenas, including organizational transformation efforts, security planning for public facilities, logistical planning and execution and business administration. Schenkel took the helm at FPS, following the February 2007 announcement of a new effort to adjust the execution of the FPS mission and to improve FPS's administration and financial management. In his first year, he developed a sequential financial system and paid more than 22,000 past due invoices dating back to 1999. He restructured the law enforcement agency and trained over 90% of his uniformed division in facility security assessments as well as law enforcement roles providing a more versatile officer capable of handling the wide range of responsibilities necessary to the protection of GSA facilities and support of Federal law enforcement functions.

He rescued the Nayak of Madurai from the tyranny of Rustam Khan and also successfully campaigned against the King of Thanjavur, who later ceded all his territories. ==Personal life== He fell in love with Kathali, a girl from the Kallar caste, later married her and then appointed his brother-in-law as the chief of Pudukottai for the military provided by tondaiman. He christened him Ragunatha Tondaman in lieu of his former chief Pallavaraya Tondaman whom he had replaced. Ragunatha Tondaman would later go on to spawn the Thondaman Dynasty of Pudukottai. Also, history states that he had many wives (more than 45) and when Kilavan Sethupathi expired, all of them committed Sati (\\"Udankattai\\"). ==Reign == He was a loyal vassal of Chokkanatha Nayak, a Nayak king who conferred him the title of Para Rajakesari (\\"lion to alien kings\\"). He helped the Nayaks by defeating the Muslims under Kutbkhan and the poligar of Ettapuram around the time when mughals under Aurangzeb were also waging campaigns in South India. In appreciation of Kilavan's help the Nayak ruler gave the privilege of celebrating Navarathri festival at the capital city. The Nayak ruler also granted places like Thirubhuvanam, Mannar Koil Tiruchuli to Kilavan. He helped Thirumalai Nayak in his war against Mysore army. Thirumalai Nayak recognized the valuable military services of Raghunatha Sethupathi and conferred the title Thirumalai Sethupathi on him. Sethupathis loyalty towards the Nayaks was over with Thirumalai Nayak. Raghunatha Sethupathi recaptured all the forts and places from the Nayaks and became an independent ruler. Raghunatha annexed some territories of Madurai Kingdom. Aranthangi, Thirumayam, Piranmalai. He opposed the spread of Christian missionary activities. Kilavan Sethupathi liberated the Marava country (area around Rameswaram) from the control of Madurai Nayak. After defeating Rani Mangammal’s army, he declared independent Marava country in 1707. He shifted his headquarters from Pugalur to Ramnad. Kilavan Sethupathi established the Nalcottal palayam (later Sivaganga) and appointed Udaya Thevar as governor. He endowed villages to a temple at Thiruvadanai and Kalaiyar Koil. He constructed a fort around the Ramanathapuram, the capital city. He constructed a dam across the Vaigai. It was during his reign, that the capital was moved from Pogalur to Ramnad. He was succeeded by his adopted son Vijaya Raghunatha Sethupathi I. ==Death and war of succession== Bhavani Shankar revolted against Raghunatha Kilavan in 1720, after securing the help of the Thanjavur Maratha king Serfoji I and Raja of Pudukkottai, invaded Vijayaraghunatha Sethupathi's seat at Aranthangi.

Kiani (born September 16, 1964) is an Iranian-born American entrepreneur who founded medical technology company Masimo in 1989. == Early life == Joe Kiani was born in Shiraz, Iran, and immigrated to the United States at the age of nine. Kiani's father was an engineer and his mother was a nurse. Despite not speaking more than three words in English when he arrived in the United States, he graduated from high school at the age of 15 and, by the time he was 22, had earned both his bachelor's (B.S.E.E) and master's (M.S.E.E) degrees in electrical engineering from San Diego State University. SDSU later honored Kiani with the College of Engineering's 2005 Monty Award, recognizing his achievements and success. == Career at Masimo == Kiani founded the medical technology company Masimo in 1989 and was later joined by partner Mohammed Diab. The company is now publicly traded and employs more than 5,300 people worldwide. Masimo pulse oximetry is used to monitor over 200 million patients per year and is the primary pulse oximetry at 9 of the top 10 hospitals listed in the 2019-20 U.S. News & World Report Best Hospitals Honor Roll. In 2011, Forbes named Masimo to its list of top 20 public companies under a billion dollars in revenue, based on earnings growth, sales growth, and return on equity. Pulse oximetry is one of the most commonly used monitoring technologies in healthcare. Masimo makes a pulse oximetry technology known as Signal Extraction Technology (SET), which is known as being the first pulse oximemtry technology to reliably measure-through motion and low perfusion conditions. Kiani and Masimo have more than 595 issued and 310 pending patents worldwide. Under Kiani's leadership, Masimo won a patent infringement award of more than $300 million in damages when it settled a lawsuit against the Nellcor division of Tyco Healthcare (now known as Covidien) for infringing on its patents for measure-through motion and low perfusion pulse oximetry in 2006. Kiani and Masimo also won a 2004 lawsuit against Tyco for violating antitrust laws specifically related to the sale of its Nellcor pulse oximetry products and was ultimately awarded $43.5 million. The Medical Device Manufacturing Association called the victory \\"a critical step in addressing the anticompetitive and other questionable practices by certain dominant manufacturers\\". In 2014, Masimo was awarded $467 million in a lawsuit against Philips for infringement of two patents related to Masimo pulse oximetry technology, a jury verdict upheld by the federal court in 2015. In 2016, Masimo and Philips signed a multi-year business partnership agreement involving technology, marketing, and sales integration, as well as a payment of $300 million from Philips to Masimo. == Industry reform == In 2002, Kiani was interviewed for a New York Times article titled \\"Medicine's Middleman\\" that focused on the practices of Group Purchasing Organizations (GPOs) and dominant medical suppliers. The article was followed by a series of 18 additional New York Times stories on GPOs over the next two years. After the Times article appeared, The United States Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy, and Consumer Rights held four hearings regarding these practices, at which Kiani testified twice. Kiani's efforts led media to call Masimo \\"the poster child for small medical device manufacturers\\" and observe that Kiani \\"almost single-handedly galvanized the rancorous debate over the GPO industry's purported role in locking out innovative technologies from the marketplace.\\"HighBeam Kiani is active in efforts to reform U.S. health care and encourage medical innovation. In 2010, Kiani and Masimo provided $10 million in funding to create the Masimo Foundation for Ethics, Innovation, and Competition in Healthcare, which is dedicated to encouraging and promoting activities that improve patient safety and deliver advanced healthcare worldwide. Masimo Foundation supports third-party research, development initiatives, and clinical studies with an emphasis on transformative projects that seek to truly enhance patient safety and outcomes; helping to forge a world free of sickness, disease and inhumanity. Joe Kiani testifies at the U.S. Senate HELP Committee. In 2013 Kiani founded the Patient Safety Movement Foundation through the support of the Masimo Foundation. More than 200,000 preventable patient deaths occur each year in U.S. hospitals. The Patient Safety Movement is committed to reducing these deaths to zero by 2020. The foundation also convenes the action-oriented annual Patient Safety, Science & Technology summit. In 2020, the Patient Safety Movement Foundation was awarded a $5 million, five-year grant from the Masimo Foundation to help advance its mission and expedite its efforts. On September 24, 2013, Kiani appeared before the Senate Health, Education, Labor & Pensions Committee and laid out five steps to help eradicate preventable patient deaths. Senator Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, said the hearing was \\"The most important hearing this committee would hold all year.\\" Also on September 24, 2013, the Patient Safety Movement announced its Commitment to Action to reduce preventable patient deaths in U.S. hospitals to zero by 2020 at the 2013 Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) Annual Meeting in New York. In March 2014, Forbes interviewed Kiani in an article called \\"Re-Engineering Healthcare To Eliminate Preventable Deaths\\". On April 1, 2014, Kiani was named by Becker's Hospital Review as one of \\"50 Experts Leading the Field of Patient Safety\\". Kiani was the only patient safety expert named who is also a medical technology company CEO. Kiani has subsequently been recognized on the same list of top 50 patient safety experts in 2015, 2016, and 2017. In 2016, Kiani was asked by then-Vice President Joe Biden to put together a team of cancer researchers and experts to assist in the “Cancer Moonshot” initiative first announced by President Obama during the January 2016 State of the Union address, with the goal of speeding cancer treatments and ultimately eradicating cancer. In 2017, at its 5th annual summit, the Patient Safety Movement Foundation announced that almost 70,000 lives had been saved and over 69 healthcare technology companies had pledged to share their data, helping to create an ecosystem for engineers to develop predictive algorithms that can help save even more lives. In 2017, Kiani was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Science by Chapman University. In 2018, the Intellectual Property Owners Education Foundation (IPOEF) honored Kiani with the first IP Champion Award, for \\"extraordinary leadership in advocating for the value of intellectual property to the progress of innovation.\\" In 2019, Kiani was made an honorary member of the Mexican Academy of Surgery. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Masimo Corporate Website * Joe Kiani Featured in San Diego State University \\"In Touch\\" Magazine Category:American health care chief executives Category:American technology chief executives Category:Living people Category:1965 births Category:San Diego State University alumni ","title":"Joe Kiani"},{"id":"20524600","text":"Fairfield–Vacaville station is a train station in Fairfield, Solano County, California, which provides rail access for the communities of Fairfield and Vacaville.

McCreary served as an alderman and the 16th Mayor of Winnipeg and as a Member of the House of Commons of Canada. McCreary was a lawyer who moved to Manitoba in 1881 where he became a Winnipeg alderman in 1883. He held that city post again in 1884 and 1886 and after a nine-year gap became the city's Mayor for 1897. He also became Commissioner of Immigration that year, noted for his assistance with providing Doukhobors with food supplies in 1898 as they settled in Western Canada. McCreary was elected to the House of Commons of Canada under the Liberal party in the 1900 federal election at Selkirk electoral district. He served most of his term in the 9th Canadian Parliament until his sudden death at Ottawa's Russell House Hotel on 4 May 1904. A doctor and coroner examining his body concluded that McCreary died of heart disease early that morning. He indicated to some colleagues the previous evening that he was experiencing chest pains, following his attendance in Parliament. The City of Winnipeg named McCreary Road in his honour.History in Winnipeg Street Names at Manitoba Historical Society The Rural Municipality of McCreary is also named after him. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:1855 births Category:1904 deaths Category:Liberal Party of Canada MPs Category:Lawyers in Manitoba Category:Mayors of Winnipeg Category:Members of the House of Commons of Canada from Manitoba Category:People from Lanark County ","title":"William McCreary"},{"id":"20524905","text":"Bill Keene (1927 – April 5, 2000) was a television and radio personality who became famous in the Los Angeles, California market as a traffic and weather announcer. He was particularly known for his colorful humorous traffic reports which included numerous puns and he became a fixture in Los Angeles broadcasting. Keene first took to the airwaves while still in high school in his native Scottsbluff, Nebraska. After serving as an Army Air Corps navigator during World War II, he was hired as news and sports director at KBOL radio in Boulder, Colorado where he studied journalism at the University of Colorado. Keene's Los Angeles broadcasting career began in 1957 at KNXT-TV (now KCBS-TV) as a weather reporter. He is credited with helping pioneer the station's hourlong news format, promoted as The Big News, which featured Keene and long time Los Angeles newscaster Jerry Dunphy and Brent Musburger. During the same period he also reported the weather on the sister radio operation KNX (AM). Later he hosted the daytime television variety show \\"Keene at Noon\\" which was later called \\"The Bill Keene Show.\\" In 1976 Keene started working full-time at KNX where he became one of the first regular radio traffic reporters in Los Angeles. Puns were a regular feature in a Bill Keene traffic report. For example, when a ladder was reported on the freeway he would announce “Watch out for rung way drivers” and “Don’t worry, the highway patrol will be taking steps to remove that ladder.” Keene retired in 1993. He died in his sleep in Tucson, Arizona in 2000, months after suffering a stroke. ==Honors== In 1992 Keene was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 2006, the California Department of Transportation officially named the Four Level Interchange in Downtown Los Angeles the Bill Keene Memorial Interchange in Keene's honor. ==References== Category:American radio personalities Category:History of Los Angeles Category:1927 births Category:2000 deaths Category:People from Scottsbluff, Nebraska ","title":"Bill Keene"},{"id":"20524937","text":"MEF's of 4700 and 3300 feet are shown on this excerpt from the FAA's Los Angeles sectional aeronautical chart. Maximum elevation figure (MEF) is a type of visual flight rule (VFR) information that indicates the elevation of the highest geographical feature within a GEOREF quadrangle area. It is of interest to pilots, who want to be aware of the highest mountain peaks and tall towers nearby, so that they can fly above them to avoid controlled flight into terrain. (\\"Features\\" includes terrain, trees, towers, and other obstacles.) Unlike the minimum safe altitude (MSA) used for flight under instrument flight rules, the MEF does not include any margin for aircraft clearance above the terrain nor for aircraft altimeter error.Aeronautical Information Circular 26/11 VFR Navigation Charts—Clarification of the Maximum Elevation Figure In a VFR flight, the MEF is commonly referred to as a \\"quadrantal altitude\\" (not to be confused with an IFR minimum sector altitude). == United States == In the US, the Federal Aviation Administration issues sectional charts. Each rectangular area covering one degree of latitude and one degree of longitude is divided into four smaller areas called quadrangles (in accordance with the World Geographic Reference System, or GEOREF), each spanning half a degree of latitude and half a degree of longitude. Each quadrangle has its MEF printed in it in thousands and hundreds of feet above mean sea level. For example, 105, means that the highest elevation is 10,500 feet within that quadrangle. MEFs are determined by taking the highest of the following: 1) The point of highest _terrain_ within a quadrangle, adding 200 ft for obstacles which are not required to be portrayed, and then adding 100 feet for vertical error and then rounding up to the next hundred feet; or 2) The height of the highest _manmade obstacle_ in the quadrangle, adding 100 feet for vertical error and then rounding up to the next hundred feet. == Canadian VNCs == The MEF on Canadian VFR navigation charts is calculated by taking the higher value of: * the top elevation of the highest obstacle plus the vertical accuracy (a variable number of feet) of the terrain source data; or * the elevation of the highest terrain plus 328 feet plus the vertical accuracy variable of the terrain source data. == Australia == In Australia, Visual Navigation Charts (VNCs) and Visual Terminal Charts (VTCs) usually indicate MEF information by use of bold elevation figures for each grid. Pilots are also required to ensure their planned route does not contravene the minimum flying altitude regulations contained in CAR 167. This restriction is normally 1000FT above populated or built-up areas and 500FT elsewhere. Procedures are different when flights are conducted under IFR, where LSALT is commonly used. LSALT may be determined in a number of ways as explained in the Australian Aeronautical Information Publication or AIP. == See also == * Minimum safe altitude (for IFR flight), including area minimum altitudes (AMA) == References == Category:Altitudes in aviation Category:Cartography Category:Highest points ","title":"Maximum elevation figure"},{"id":"20524996","text":"East Saint Louis Senior High School is the only high school located in East Saint Louis, Illinois.

The .44 Bull Dog cartridge was manufactured only in the USA, probably for those bothered by the sharp recoil of the more powerful .44 Webley round in such small guns, or who were particularly cost conscious. (Typically, in the late 19th century U.S., a box of .44 Bull Dog cartridges cost $0.68 for 50 rounds, compared to $0.90 for 50 of the longer .44 Webley round., page 68 The .44 Bull Dog and .44 Webley cartridges continued to be commercially offered in the U.S. until 1938 or 1939.Barnes, p.170, \\".44 Webley/.44 R.I.C.\\") Also, the Bull Dog was very easy to carry.

Hansen was the guitarist, played the kazoo and was one of the vocalists, Bruce's expertise lay in the field of playing piano and vocals, Gleeson was the drummer and Fletcher played bass. They released their debut and only recording, an EP, A Tiny Mark, on 1 July 1999. A Tiny Mark consisted of six tracks – five original tracks as well as \\"Moving Right Along\\", a song from The Muppet Movie. It was produced by Michael Carpenter, mastered by Don Bartley, and distributed through MGM Distribution. Tom Gleeson left the band in September 2000 to pursue his comedy career, and was replaced by Bruce Braybrooke. Gleeson went on to perform in skitHOUSE, as well as numerous Australian Comedy Tours, Melbourne International Comedy Festivals and Adelaide Fringe Festivals. The band recorded only two other released tracks: \\"The Fantastic Leslie Theme Song\\" and a cover of the Nick Drake song, \\"At the Chime of the City Clock\\". These were respectively released on Grow Your Own 2000 and Jeremy Flies; A Tribute to Nick Drake. They split in about 2003, when they were beginning to actively pursue their own careers. In an interview with The Age Hansen admitted he was a frustrated musician and related to his times with The Fantastic Leslie. ===Post Leslie=== Andrew Hansen is a member of The Chaser team, who have produced six TV shows, Andrew being in five of them, including Logie Award winning CNNNN and AFI Award winning The Chaser's War on Everything, as well as three musicals/stage shows, including The Chaser's Age of Terror Variety Hour which toured Australia in 2008. Cameron Bruce, after leaving The Fantastic Leslie, joined Karma County as part of the backing band for a Carole King Tribute show, Tapestry. He has also been a part-time floating member of Pinky Beecroft's White Russians, and the Beautiful Girls. He was a third of comedy/musical trio GUD, along with Paul McDermott and Mick Moriarty, and progressed onto playing in his own and Paul Kelly's band, and playing keyboards for both Good News Week and The Sideshow. Bruce Braybrooke is now the drummer in The Beautiful Girls. James Fletcher is now working as a news reporter for the BBC Radio in London. There are currently no plans for a reunion; however, Fletcher has said that nothing is impossible when it comes to a gig. Andrew Hansen, Tom Gleeson and Cameron Bruce appeared together on an episode of GNW on 19 October 2009 playing in the segment, Strange but True. ==DiscographyAlbums=== * A Tiny Mark – Independent/MGM Distribution (1999) Tracks # \\"Sea Shanty\\" was \\"Not strictly a sea shanty in the original pirate meaning of the term.

It is now a peace garden dedicated to all the Muslim soldiers of the British Indian Army who died during both wars. The site measures about by and is located in the southeast corner of Horsell Common about off Monument Road. It is a Grade II listed building. Large numbers of men from the Indian subcontinent fought on the Western Front during World War I. Some of those who were injured were moved to hospitals on the English south coast including one at Brighton Pavilion. Of those, nineteen Muslims died and were buried here. The burial ground was created, at least in part, to counteract German propaganda that Muslim Indian soldiers were not being buried according to their religious rites. The site was on land compulsorily purchased from the Earl of Onslow and chosen for its proximity to the Shah Jahan Mosque, the first purpose-built mosque in the United Kingdom. A further five men who died during World War II were also buried here. In the 1960s the site was becoming subject to vandalism so in 1968 the bodies were transferred to the Military Cemetery at Brookwood. However this also meant that the Commonwealth War Graves Commission ceased further maintenance of the site, which became overgrown and further vandalised. Ownership reverted to the Horsell Common Preservation Society, the owners of the surrounding common in succession to the Earl of Onslow. In the 1990s work was undertaken to clear the vegetation and stabilised the walls, as a result of financial support from a local resident of Woking, the musician Paul Weller. In 2011, Woking Borough Council, working in conjunction with the Horsell Common Preservation Society, received a grant from English Heritage, which enabled the restoration of the walls and chatri. In November 2015, the empty interior of the burial ground was landscaped to create a Peace Memorial Garden, dedicated to all the Muslim soldiers of the British Indian Army who died in World War I and II. The reflecting pool and memorial stone The garden brings together the cultural expression of the traditional Islamic Garden with the natural elements of the Common. The original walls and chhatri of the burial ground were retained and now surround a reflecting pond fed by a rill and small waterfall from an upper pool. By this is a memorial stone engraved with the names of the original burials, which acts as the garden’s focus. Himalayan Birch trees planted around the pool also symbolise the servicemen who died.

It was part of a line of frontier forts established to protect travelers and settlers within Texas. ==Establishment== A line of seven army posts were established in 1848-49 after the Mexican War to protect the settlers of West Texas and included Fort Worth, Fort Graham, Fort Gates, Fort Croghan, Fort Martin Scott, Fort Lincoln and Fort Duncan.Crimmins, M.L., 1943, The First Line of Army Posts Established in West Texas in 1849, Abilene: West Texas Historical Association, Vol. XIX, pp. 121-127 The fort was originally established as Camp Houston when D Company, 1st Regiment of Infantry commanded by Captain Seth Eastman arrived from Fort Snelling, Minnesota Territory on December 5, 1848.Monthly returns of Company D, 1st Infantry and Regimental returns from September - December 1848 Company D was ordered to a camp on the Leona, departing in March 1849 and arriving on the 24th.1849 Annual return of 1st Infantry Company I, 8th Regiment of Infantry arrived in the Fredericksburg area on March 8th.

The post was then called \\"Camp near Fredericksburg.\\" On July 17th, Company B, 2nd Regiment of Dragoons arrives on site.July 1849 monthly return of the 2nd Regiment of DragoonsThese two companies would share the post for some time. The camp was located two miles (3 km) southeast of Fredericksburg on Baron's Creek and eventually consisted of a complex of twenty-one buildings. The soldiers patrolled the Fredericksburg-San Antonio road and surrounding area. One mission of the outpost was to protect settlers from Indian depredations. The Eighth Military Department renamed the camp in December 1849 for Major Martin Scott, who was killed at the Battle of Molino del Rey in the Mexican War in 1847. As the settlers pushed farther west, Fort Martin Scott lost its strategic significance. The 2nd Dragoons were ordered to do a major scouting expedition in the Spring of 1851. Company B was relieved of duty to Fort Martin Scott on May 1st. When the Regiment finished the scouting trip, Company B and Company A met and established Fort Mason on the site of present day Mason, Texas.July 1851 monthly return of 2nd Dragoons Company K, 8th Infantry continued to occupy Fort Martin Scott until February 1852. The Company left Fort Martin Scott on February 15th along with other 8th Infantry units that had recently arrived. A small detachment was left behind in charge of the public property.1852 Annual return of the 9th Regiment of Infantry Under the control of the detachment the site was used for storage, supplies, etc. On Jan 7th, 1853 Company G, 8th Infantry left Ft Chadbourne in charge of animals captured from the Lipan Apache to be delivered to Fort Martin Scott, arriving on January 31st. They returned to Fort Chadbourne in March. February 1853 monthly return of the 8th Infantry Regiment and Fort Martin Scott monthly return for March 1853 In 1853, Army inspectors recommended that the fort be closed. The last monthly return for the fort was November 1853. The Eighth Military Department ordered that Fort Martin Scott close in December 1853. ===Treaties=== Meusebach treaty The full text of this treaty can be found at Meusebach–Comanche Treaty. On May 9, 1847, prior to the establishment of Fort Martin Scott, an expedition under John O. Meusebach negotiated the non-government Treaty Between the Comanche and the German Immigration Company. The treaty was limited to the specific area between the Llano River and the San Saba River, and only addressed the relations between the Penateka Comanche and the immigrants who came under the aegis of the German Immigration Company. Fort Martin Scott treaty The full text of the treaty can be found at Fort Martin Scott Treaty. The Fort Martin Scott Treaty was an unratified treaty, negotiated and signed on December 10, 1850 by Indian agent John Rollins, U. S. Army Captain Hamilton W. Merrill, Captain J.B. McGown of the Texas Mounted Volunteers (Texas Rangers), interpreters John Connor and Jesse Chisholm, as well as twelve Comanche chiefs, six Caddo chiefs, four Lipan chiefs, five Quapaw chiefs, four Tawakoni chiefs, and four Waco chiefs. The treaty was actually signed in San Saba County but named for the nearest military outpost. On December 25, 1850, General George M. Brooke sent a copy of the treaty to Texas Governor Peter Hansborough Bell, mentioning the treaty had not been approved by the government and was essentially binding only on the part of the Indian tribes. This treaty put the signed tribes under the sole jurisdiction of the United States of America. It regulated commerce and prohibited supplying alcoholic beverages to the tribes. The tribes were required to remain at peace with each other and the United States government, and to be at peace with other tribes the government deemed at peace. The tribes were to return all stolen property and captives and to cease depredations. The government made it tribal responsibility to report any suspected activity that might violate the treaty, and to assist the government in recovering runaway slaves. In return, the government would establish trading posts and give the tribes blacksmiths and school teachers. The treaty also required the tribes to allow Christian preachers to minister to them, and to allow said preachers unrestrained travel through tribal territory. ==Post Infantry years== The site was occupied intermittently by the Texas Rangers and then the Confederate States Army. In September 1866, General Philip H. Sheridan ordered elements of the Fourth United States Cavalry to Fort Martin Scott to secure the frontier once again from possible Indian attacks. By the end of 1866, the fort was permanently abandoned by military units. Many of the Martin Scott commanders fought in the American Civil War, including William R. Montgomery, William Steele, Edward D. Blake, James Longstreet, and Theodore Fink. In the early 1880s, the fort was the location of the Gillespie County Fair. Owned from 1870–1959 by members of the Braeutigam family, Martin Scott was sold to the City of Fredericksburg in 1959. In 1986, the Fredericksburg Heritage Federation began extensive work of reconstructing the site as a tourist attraction.Brochure, Fort Martin Scott, Fredericksburg, Texas ===Braeutigam family=== Johann Wolfgang Braeutigam (1829–1884) emigrated with his family from Kaltenlengsfeld, Germany and arrived at Indianola on Dec 1845. Johann, his wife Christine and their nine children eventually settled in Fredericksburg. In 1870, the family moved into the abandoned Fort Martin Scott, from which Braeutigam operated a biergarten. On September 3, 1884, Braeutigam was murdered by four strangers in a robbery of the biergarten's cash box. The city of Fredericksburg bought the Fort Martin Scott property from the Braeutigam family. Among highlights of the fort are the post commander's quarters (formerly Braeutigam Garden), six buildings of officers’ housing, sutler’s store and warehouse, laundry, bakehouse with oven, military hospital, three sets of enlisted men's barracks, quartermaster’s warehouse, a stable with barn, and a blacksmith shop. The guardhouse, made of cut limestone, is the only surviving building from the original fort, having been restored to its original design in the early 1990s. It was the Braeutigam's homestead. ==Historical site== Fort Martin Scott was designated a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark in 1936, Marker number 10039, and added to the National Register of Historic Places in Texas on January 20, 1980. The fort is operated by the city of Fredericksburg and offers self-guided walking tours, pre-scheduled guided tours and school tours. Located at 1606 East Main Street (Highway 290), the site is open Tuesday through Sunday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Donations. As of October 8, 2010, the Former Texas Rangers Association is moving forward with a plan approved by the Fredericksburg City Council to build a Texas Rangers Heritage Center adjacent to Fort Martin Scott. The plans are for an educational complex that will focus on the heritage of not only the Texas Rangers but also Fort Martin Scott and Gillespie County. Scheduled ground breaking on the multimillion-dollar center is for October 2011. ==Gallery== File:Fort Martin Scott 2.jpgFort Martin Scott plan File:Fort Martin Scott.jpgHistorical marker File:Fort Martin Scott - tree & building.jpgFort Martin Scott - tree & building (in 2015) ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Gillespie County, Texas *Forts of Texas ==ReferencesExternal links== *Fort Martin Scott - official site * * photos of the restored buildings *Texas Rangers Heritage Center website Category:Forts in Texas Category:National Register of Historic Places in Gillespie County, Texas Category:Buildings and structures in Gillespie County, Texas Category:Museums in Gillespie County, Texas Category:Military and war museums in Texas Category:Open-air museums in Texas Category:History museums in Texas Category:Native American history of Texas Category:Recorded Texas Historic Landmarks Category:Ghost towns in Central Texas Category:Fredericksburg, Texas Category:Forts on the National Register of Historic Places in Texas ","title":"Fort Martin Scott"},{"id":"20525293","text":"The 2008 Brut Sun Bowl, part of the 2008–09 NCAA Division I FBS bowl season, was played on December 31, 2008 at the stadium of the same name on the campus of the University of Texas at El Paso in El Paso, Texas.

Established the February 26, 1904, it was given control of the Panama Canal Zone over which the United States exercised sovereignty.Matthew Parker. Hell's Gorge:The Battle to Build the Panama Canal. p.214 The commission reported directly to Secretary of War William Taft. It was initially composed of seven members, appointed by President Theodore Roosevelt, directed to avoid the inefficiency and corruption that had plagued the French 15 years earlier. On May 6, 1904, President Theodore Roosevelt appointed John Findley Wallace, formerly chief engineer and finally general manager of the Illinois Central Railroad, chief engineer of the Panama Canal project. Wallace was paid a $25,000 annual salary, the highest of any government employee at that time other than the president. In addition to the engineering and health problems, Wallace faced many bureaucratic challenges from the ICC, which had to approve essentially every significant decision Wallace made in the Canal Zone. With engineers filling out more than 1,000 work request forms weekly, even the simplest tasks often took months to complete. In addition to \\"make dirt fly\\", as directed by Roosevelt, Wallace was forced to use the often dilapidated infrastructure and equipment left behind by the French when they sold their concession.The Chief Engineers of the Panama Canal Accessed 7 Jan 2012 The ICC was later reduced to three members on the recommendation of John Findley Wallace, the chief engineer. Overwhelmed, Wallace resigned abruptly in June 1905. In 1906 when a new chief engineer, John Frank Stevens, was appointed, he was not a member of the commission. He increasingly viewed the bureaucratic ICC as a serious hindrance and ended up bypassing the commission and sending requests and demands directly to the Roosevelt Administration in Washington. In Washington, D.C., Joseph Bucklin Bishop, an associate of Theodore Roosevelt and a strong editorial advocate for U.S. participation in the canal project, was appointed Executive Secretary of the Isthmian Canal Commission the following year (1905). Bishop was tasked with managing the commission's day-to-day matters, but also with ensuring public support for the canal through public relations and by keeping the project's official history. Bishop's promised $10,000 annual salary was relentlessly criticized by Roosevelt's opponents in Congress, mostly because it was twice what each of them made. Opposition newspapers joined in the criticism. In the summer of 1907, when escalating allegations of cronyism surrounding Bishop's appointment threatened appropriations for Panama Canal construction, Taft, surely with Roosevelt's quiet assent, ordered Bishop out of Washington to Panama, where the partisan political heat would be less intense. \\"I accept your decision without reluctance,\\" Bishop informed Taft, \\"and shall go to the Isthmus, not sadly but cheerfully.\\"My Dear Bishop, p. 222 It would not be his first trip to Panama. In the fall of the previous year, Bishop had gone ahead to advance Roosevelt's historic inspection tour, the first time a sitting president had journeyed outside the United States. In 1907, the Isthmian Canal Commission hired photographer Ernest \\"Red\\" Hallen to photograph the progress of the canal, in order to satisfy both Washington and the American public. Hallen would go on to document the entirety of the Canal's construction and everyday life for the following 30 years. Joseph Bucklin Bishop would, except for month-long summer breaks, remain on the isthmus for seven years, serving clandestinely at first as Theodore Roosevelt's \\"eyes and ears\\". He reported back on the \\"astonishing\\" progress that Army Corps of Engineers Colonel George Washington Goethals and his team were making excavating the \\"big ditch\\", building dams and locks. Before long, Bishop became Goethals's trusted aide, serving as his first line of defense against workers with complaints and grievances. But Bishop's greatest achievement in Panama would be as founding editor of The Canal Record, a weekly newspaper for the thousands of workers in Panama. His regular reports of the cubic yards dug by rival work divisions, and the competitive baseball games they played, created a spirit of healthy competition that lifted worker morale and productivity. The \\"good news\\" of The Canal Record also built vital public support on newspaper editorial pages back home and in the halls of the United States Congress, where annual appropriations were required to keep the canal project moving forward. ==References== Category:Panama Canal Zone ","title":"Isthmian Canal Commission"},{"id":"20525307","text":"The rufous beaked snake (Rhamphiophis oxyrhynchus) is a species of mildly venomous snake endemic to East Africa.

It was developed by Armonk Corporation, a small software development company based in Newport Beach, California, and was published under their \\"Gray Flannel Fun\\" label.PC Magazine, April 1983, p. 523 The game is a prototypically self-aware humor- driven (yet with serious aspects) 1980's \\"executive simulator\\" similar to the 1989 NES game Wall Street Kid. Unlike most other business simulations, it does not involve making actual economic decisions or managing stores of resources. Rather, the player must manage the trajectory of their character's career at a single fictional corporation, MMC (Mighty Microcomputer Corporation), by making a series of on-the-job and managerial decisions while navigating office politics, evading blame for bad outcomes, and gaining support in different roles throughout the company. The game presents the player with situations and problems which must be solved by choosing from multiple choices. After a series of questions the game evaluates the player's performance resulting in either a career advancement option or getting fired from the company. During the course of the game, the economy can change from a boom into a recession and even into a depression. The goal of the simulation is to rise to the position of President, thus coming to occupy the titular and coveted \\"Executive suite\\", before hitting the firm's mandatory retirement age of seventy-five. == Gameplay == The game begins with an interview portion, where the applicant arrives at the office of MMC's Personnel Manager. The player is asked a series of probing demographic questions about where they went to school, what they studied, how well they did in their studies, what their personality and level of ambition is like, their favorite sport and years of work experience, as well as their age, gender, and marital status. Some of this information is used to determine the list of entry-level jobs available to the player—the high school graduate is stuck with an initial position in the mailroom or as a maintenance person while someone with an Engineering education and good grades will be able to enter at a higher position. Amusingly, background and consistency has little to no bearing beyond this point – until very senior levels, the player is encouraged to take jobs in many departments to build their ranks of named friends across the organization. Since at MMC, workers apparently do not receive promotions but instead must every few years apply for new jobs internally, gameplay proceeds very cyclically. At application time, the player is presented with a list of available jobs which have a particular job level and are tied to a specific department (Production, Marketing, Sales, Public Relations, Administration, Engineering, Accounting). Their character's performance in their previous position (poor, good, average), their repute in individual departments, and the status of the global business cycle (the economy is a state of expansion, recession, or even depression) determines this list, down which the player can (if they are incompetent or even unlucky) fall precipitously, or get stuck in low or mid-level jobs. As the employee makes decisions, they collect reputation attributes (such as for habitually shirking work or, on the other hand, aggressively looking out for the company's interest) and cause events for which they are either \\"fortunately\\" or \\"unfortunately\\" remembered at hiring time; this determines whether they get a \\"thumbs-up\\" or a \\"thumbs-down\\" for the new post. If they get the job, a Status Change form is sent detailing the new salary and an often dubious set of perks to go along with the new position. When not between jobs, the player is presented with short scenarios pertinent to the position which must be resolved by picking one of several solutions. The scenarios vary in terms of the seriousness of poor outcomes: sometimes the worst choice is not much different from the optimal choice (especially in social \\"no-win scenarios\\", sometimes only the next hiring cycle is adversely affected, or an action puts off a potential executive ally or puts a permanent black mark on the personnel file. In a few rare instances, even a flawlessly performing employee can trigger a game over with a poor decision – such as by quitting the company for another job, or by sleeping with the wrong contact. Too much \\"poor\\" performance in a role also triggers a note detailing the player's termination (\\"Hit the road, jack\\") from MMC, replete with an enumeration of all the demerits registered in the personnel file, and the game ends. Eventually, if the employee avoids termination, and reaches the highest job level before reaching the mandatory retirement age, they have the opportunity to apply for the position of President, subject to a review of their merits conducted by the Board. Upon winning the game, there is a nameplate change in the Executive Suite, a formal announcement of the hire is made, and the employee's current worth is calculated as a final score. ==Themes== In general, the player benefits from making decisions that keep them out of harm's way with management, and generally avoiding unethical, illegal, unsound, or obviously inane decisions—unless they provide a clear benefit to their perceived loyalty within the firm. Suppliers, scheming coworkers, competitors, and representatives of regulatory agencies such as the IRS and OSHA are all best viewed adversarially. In keeping with the game's satirical and cynical view of corporate culture, it also pays to keep track of the caricatural personalities of officers of the company with an eye to impressing rather than disappointing them (for example, the nepotistic and doddering incumbent President values loyalty to a fault, while the VP of Administration hates extra work being made for her, and executives in Sales and Marketing are mostly concerned with receiving credit for their exploits and putting on good entertainment for clients). Consistent with the game's theme of impersonality and disposability, you are not rewarded for looking after family members in decisions, or for making money from your dealings on the side. ==Trivia== * There is a hidden message from a programmer (presumably Norman M. Hill) hidden in the binary data of the game. It reads * Armonk, New York has been the headquarters of IBM Corporation since the mid-1960s.

The first edition of the book attributed authorship to \\"Two Women of the West.\\" They were Alice Ilgenfritz Jones and Ella Merchant, writers who lived in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. ==Genre== The novel is one of a large number of works of speculative fiction and utopian and dystopian fiction that characterized the later nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.Matthew Beaumont, Utopia Ltd.: Ideologies of Social Dreaming in England, 1870-1900, Leiden, Brill Academic Publishers, 2005.Jean Pfaelzer, The Utopian Novel in America, 1886-1896: The Politics of Form, Pittsburgh, University of Pittsburgh Press, 1984.Kenneth Roemer, The Obsolete Necessity, 1888-1900, Kent, OH, Kent State University Press, 1976. Feminist issues and approaches were significant in this wave of speculative literature. While women writers typically advocated feminist causes and values (as in Mary Lane's Mizora and Elizabeth Corbett's New Amazonia), there were also exceptions: conservative and traditionally-oriented women who used speculative fiction to argue against feminism (as in Anna Bowman Dodd's The Republic of the Future). ==Story== Jones and Merchant differed from some other feminist novelists of their generation (like Corbett and Lane, mentioned above) in that they made their fictional protagonist male instead of female. Their hero travels to the planet Mars in an \\"aeroplane.\\" (That term had originated in France in 1879; this novel provided one of the earliest uses of the word in English.)William Shepard Walsh, A Handy Book of Curious Information, Philadelphia, J. B. Lippincott, 1913; p. 14. The nameless traveller visits two different \\"Marsian\\" societies; in both, there is equality between men and women. In one, Paleveria, women have adopted the negative characteristics of men; in Caskia, the other, gender equality \\"has made both sexes kind, loving, and generous.\\"Suzanne Romaine, Communicating Gender, London, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates/Taylor & Francis, 1998; pp. 331-2. The technological level is comparable on both planets; the Martians rely on Martian horses for transport. The narrator first lands in the Martian country of Paleveria, which is a republican and capitalist state, with clear class divisions; the people are vegetarians, and dress in loose robes. Their homes (at least among the aristocrats) are classical and palatial, with marble floors and statuary, silk hangings, and frescoes on the walls. Women in Paleveria can vote, hold political office, and run businesses; they propose marriage to men, have sex with male prostitutes, and even participate in wrestling matches. The traveller stays with an astronomer named Severnius, in the city of Thursia; he studies diligently and learns the language. Severnius acts as his guide to Paleverian society -- as does the astronomer's beautiful sister Elodia. The narrator soon falls in love with Elodia, but is shocked by her liberated traits and habits. Elodia is a banker by profession; she drinks alcohol and imbibes a Martian drug, has affairs with men, and eventually reveals an illegitimate child.Everett Franklin Bleiler with Richard Bleiler, Science- Fiction: The Early Years, Kent, OH, Kent State University Press, 1990; p. 753. Severnius, for his part, asks the narrator about Earth, and the traveller is hard put to provide logical and acceptable explanations for many Earthly customs, mainly involving the distinctions between the sexes. The narrator is appalled by women participating in martial arts -- and Elodia condemns this too; but she also condemns men's boxing matches, which the traveller accepts as natural. The narrator and Severnius debate several other issues including women, specifically centered around their nature, which the narrator argues is inherent to all women while Severnius argues that character is based entirely on the individual and is a separate sphere than gender. While on a walk with Elodia, the narrator confronts her about many of these differences and the anxiety he has felt on the planet. He insists that she is better than the version of herself she presents and pushes a more conservative version of femininity that he believes she could embody. It is then that Elodia reveals that she has had a child out of wedlock that she does not claim. The narrator is profoundly shocked when he learns of Elodia's illegitimate daughter; he leaves for a visit to Caskia. This northern country has a more co-operative and egalitarian social and economic order than Paleveria has; its people cultivate intellectual, artistic, and spiritual qualities. Caskia approaches the status of a Martian Utopia. In the city of Lunismar, the traveller meets another Martian woman, Ariadne, who is more traditionally feminine by conservative Earthly standards. He considers her \\"the highest and purest thing under heaven.\\" He also meets a venerated teacher called The Master; the two have a long spiritual conversation. The narrator returns to Earth. Unveiling a Parallel has been reprinted in several modern editions. ==Analysis== Jones and Merchant worked to make sure that their fictional world on Mars was very similar to their own world so that the differences between the two would be easier to compare. Technology on both of the planets are even the same. For example, the Martians also use horse-drawn carriages to get around. This focus on matching the two worlds in fiction writing was common during the nineteenth century and was known as \\"realism\\".Trachtenberg, Alan. The Incorporation of America Culture and Society in the Gilded Age. Brantford, Ontario: W. Ross MacDonald School Research Services Library, 2016. p. 88 This does not necessarily mean that the story seems like it could really happen but that everyday people would think that it was similar to their own lives and could put themselves in the story. \\"Everyday people\\" though meant a very specific group in America which was the growing middle-class of the country. By making the new world seem familiar to the middle class, Merchant and Jones hinted at the possibility of equality between the sexes and how it would work in their American lives. They also try to do this by creating a constant debate between Severnius and the traveler. Whenever the traveler encounters something new on Mars, he gets confused and will ask many questions and explain why he thinks things work differently on Earth. Severnius then can explain why Martians do it differently so that anyone reading the story can see the argument that Jones and Merchant are trying to make about why equality between men and women would be possible in America. For example, Severnius tells the traveler that women are allowed to vote on Mars because they are a part of society. The traveler tries to give a reason for why women are not allowed the same rights on Earth by mentioning the laws around owning land as a requirement for voting. But when Severnius learns that women on Earth can own land in certain circumstances but are still not allowed to vote he points out that this is unfair. Women in America were arguing similar points and the prevention of land-owning women from voting was what made many women angry enough to begin looking to get the right to vote.Baker, Paula. \\"The Domestication of Politics: Women and American Political Society, 1780–1920.\\" Women and Politics 89, no. 3 (June 1984): 620-47. But even though Jones and Merchant are talking about women's rights they were not talking about them in the same ways as other feminists of the same time. Paleverian women are much more sexually free than women in the nineteenth century thought they should be, even many of those who were looking for female freedoms. The fact that the women have access to male prostitutes and that Elodia has a child out of wedlock that she does not tell people is hers is a problem to the other Martians. However, it is not because she is a woman like it is with the traveler. The Martians are upset about what Elodia has done because they think that she is another person who has given in to the temptation of sex as many people do. Talking about sexual freedom was an issue that many feminists of the nineteenth century did not want to do and caused many women within the feminists' circles to disagree and fight against each other.McGerr, Michael E. A Fierce Discontent: The Rise and Fall of the Progressive Movement in America. Riverside: Free Press, 2010. p. 266 Jones and Merchant may not have wanted women to have male prostitutes but wanted to simply \\"unveil the parallel\\" and different standards that men and women are held to when it comes to making human mistakes. Even Severnius says to the traveler that even though he is not thrilled about the idea of women having sex out of marriage, it does not make sense that men should be freer to do it than women. \\"What possible reason is there why men, more than women, should be privileged to indulge in vice?\\" Because the story is a utopian society where women have more rights than they did in nineteenth-century America the story is often compared to Charlotte Perkins Gilman's Herland. Besides simply looking at similar issues, both stories are told from an outside man's point of view who is related to their contemporary American society in some way. The use of a male narrator who is generally not positive to the idea of women's rights to explain the \\"failings\\" of a society which is controlled even partially by women gives the novels a layer of humor.Hollinger, Veronica. \\"Utopia, Science, Postmodernism, and Feminism: A Trilogy of Significant Works.\\" Science Fiction Studies 21, no. 2 (July 1994): 232-37. Again, however, Jones and Merchant's story is much more radical than Gilman's. They discuss sexual freedom in ways that Gilman chooses to avoid completely, and they also completely avoided the cliché of a marriage in the ending. The traveler proposed marriage to Elodia, but she tells him no and then reveals her secret child which makes him fall out of love with her. However, women's rights issues were not the only political problems that the two authors talk about in their story. Paleveria suffers from many of the same problems that America did at the time. Class relations, which were a very big problem in America that caused much tension and anger are present on Mars as well. When Severnius shows the narrator the shrine that he has built in his home, he tells the narrator how sad he is that he decided to bring it back from the other Martian society because instead of encouraging people to be more religious it has become \\"aristocratic to have one’s own private shrine, and not to go to church at all except in condescension, to patronize the masses\\". Even something which should bring people together, such as religion, has become tangled with the distinctions between the rich and poor, showing how deep the problem goes in the Martian society. These negative relationships between the rich and poor were very similar to the sort of class conflicts that Americans were dealing with during the Progressive era. While many people began to believe that people having too much money could cause bad things to happen, people were becoming richer than anyone else had ever been which led to many disagreements and tensions between the upper and lower classes. By showing this in their own society, Merchant and Jones try to show how bad these tensions can go if they are not stopped.McGerr, Michael E. A Fierce Discontent: The Rise and Fall of the Progressive Movement in America. Riverside: Free Press, 2010. p.7 Merchant and Jones also bring in other political issues when the traveler leaves Paleveria and goes to visit Severnius’ friends in Caskia. In Caskia, the narrator stays with someone who is only known as The Master. During the last part of the story, The Master works in the same way that Severnius did at the beginning of the story, by having a debate with the narrator to show those who are reading the novel the logic behind many of the decisions of the society itself. He condemns the ways that people on Earth choose to practice religion because they do not \\"separate the spiritual meaning of Christ's words from their literal meaning\\". He thinks that Americans are more focused on the images and symbols of religion rather than focusing on the message. Progressives were making similar arguments about religion and the ways in which the distinction between good and bad was getting more and more blurred to people and how many reformers were focused on the immorality and lack of religion in people as the reason for the political problems that the country was having. They believed that they could fix these problems by removing all vice from their lives.McGerr, Michael E. A Fierce Discontent: The Rise and Fall of the Progressive Movement in America. Riverside: Free Press, 2010. p.85 The Master argues that believing human nature to be flawed would believing that God had created something imperfect which seems disrespectful to the ideals they are creating themselves. ==Authors== Alice Ilgenfritz Jones (1846-1905) wrote other novels during her career: High Water Mark (1879), Beatrice of Bayou Têche (1895), and The Chevalier of St. Denis (1900). She also wrote short fiction and travel essays. Ella Robinson Merchant (1857-1916) owned newspapers in Montana and Iowa with her husband Stoddard Merchant, and continued to operate the Cedar Rapids Daily Republican after his death. She published no other works of fiction. ==ReferencesUnveiling a Parallel at Project Gutenberg * Unveiling a Parallel online * Another source Category:1893 American novels Category:1893 science fiction novels Category:Feminist science fiction novels Category:American science fiction novels Category:Utopian novels Category:Mars in fiction ","title":"Unveiling a Parallel"},{"id":"20525370","text":"Yangzhen () is a town situated in the Shunyi District of Beijing.

It is a single-story masonry structure, with a cruciform plan and a central cupola. The front (south-facing) facade is flanked by low square towers topped by rounded wood-frame stages that are terminated in crosses. The entrance, set between these towers, is flanked by replacement columns and topped by a full Greek entablature (the columns are a simpler replacement for ones that had Corinthian capitals). Windows are generally set in round-arch openings. The Greek congregation was established in 1908 by immigrants who arrived to work at the American Optical Company, and at first met in private residences. The congregation's first church was built in 1910, but burned down in 1932. This church, built that same year on land purchased from the Hamilton Woolen Mill, is typical of other Greek Orthodox churches built in central Massachusetts around that time. It was designed by George Glynou and built by F. X. Lalliberte and Sons. The bell, donated by the Hamilton Woolen Company, was made in 1860 in Troy, New York. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Southbridge, Massachusetts *National Register of Historic Places listings in Worcester County, Massachusetts ==ReferencesExternal links== *St. George Greek Orthodox Church web site Category:Churches in Worcester County, Massachusetts Category:Churches in Southbridge, Massachusetts Category:Eastern Orthodox churches in Massachusetts Category:Greek-American culture in Massachusetts Category:Churches completed in 1932 Category:20th-century Eastern Orthodox church buildings Category:National Register of Historic Places in Southbridge, Massachusetts Category:Churches on the National Register of Historic Places in Massachusetts ","title":"St. George's Greek Orthodox Church (Southbridge, Massachusetts)"},{"id":"20525539","text":"Ahmad Heryawan (born 19 June 1966) is an Indonesian politician who served as the Governor of West Java Province between 2008 and 2018.

He had previously gained experience in railroad construction in the American Midwest.Matthew Parker. Hell's Gorge:The Battle to Build the Panama Canal. p.214-16 ==Biography== John Findley Wallace was born, September 10, 1852, in Fall River, Mass., the oldest son of the Rev. Dr. David A. and Martha J. (Findley) Wallace. His father, Rev. Dr. David A. Wallace, D.D., LL.D., was the first president of The Monmouth College, Monmouth, Illinois. John Findley Wallace attended Monmouth College in Illinois with the class of 1872. He received his degree of C.E. from the University of Wooster, 1882, and Sc.D. from Armour Institute, 1904. ==Panama Canal construction== On May 6, 1904, President Theodore Roosevelt appointed Wallace as chief engineer of the Panama Canal. As with the French effort to build the canal before him, malaria, other tropical diseases and especially yellow fever plagued the country and further reduced the already depleted workforce. Despite his requests to the contrary, the project was forced to use dilapidated and undersized infrastructure and equipment that had been purchased from the French by the U.S. government. This included primitive steam shovels and an undersized and rusting railway system. The project struggled to make significant progress. In an attempt to avoid the inefficiency and corruption that had slowed earlier French efforts, a U.S. government commission, the Isthmian Canal Commission (ICC), was established to oversee construction. However, it proved to be overly bureaucratic and was an impediment to progress. Not initially a member of the seven-man ICC, and in an attempt to streamline its efforts, Wallace was appointed to it when it was reformed and its membership reduced to three following his own recommendation. However, the real solution to the problem would be found by his successor, John Frank StevensParker p.253-5 who simply bypassed the commission and sent requests and demands directly to the Roosevelt Administration in Washington. As recommended by a U.S. engineering panel in 1905, Wallace remained an advocate of the concept of a sea-level canal at Panama. To reduce the costs of construction and enable faster completion, this approach was later changed to a reservoir lake and lock system.Parker p.284 The new plan would increase operating costs, however, and limit the maximum size of ships able to use the canal. Wallace was paid $25,000 a year, the second largest salary in the American government, behind only the president.Parker p.216 Despite this, in 1906 a frustrated Wallace abruptly resigned and returned to the mainland United States.Parker p.251-2 The Wallace resignation ultimately led to a better understanding of the difficult nature of the project by the Roosevelt administration, resulting in reforms that included larger, more realistic construction budgets.

He was the son of a weaver, and followed the same employment himself in his youth. This, however, he soon gave up, and, though he had a poor general education, he embraced the medical profession, by which he acquired for a time a great reputation, and amassed a large fortune. He adopted the principles of the Methodic school, but modified and developed them. He appears to have exalted himself at the expense to his predecessors; asserting that none of them had contributed to the advance of medical science, and boasting that he himself could teach the art of healing in six months.

He was educated at Rust College, from which he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Sociology. When he initially entered college, Childress intended to become a doctor, enrolling in typical pre-med courses. He had no thoughts of becoming involved in acting, but became involved in theater outside of classes. Rex Ingram in the Federal Theatre Project production of Haiti (1938) Childress moved to New York City and became an actor with Harlem's Lafayette Players, a troupe of stock players associated with the Lafayette Theatre. Soon, he was engaged as an actor in the Federal Theater Project, the American Negro Theater, and in all-black race film productions such as Keep Punching (1939). His greatest success on the stage was his performance as Noah in the popular comedy, Anna Lucasta, which ran for 957 performances. He also worked at Teachers College of Columbia University. Childress also operated his own radio and record store in New York City. When he learned about casting for the Amos 'n Andy television series, Childress decided to audition for a role. He was hired a year before the show went on the air. In 1951, he was cast as the level-headed, hard-working and honest Amos Jones in the popular television series, The Amos 'n Andy Show, which ran for two years on CBS and made a star of the old-time vaudeville comedian, Tim Moore. Childress originally tried out for the role of The Kingfish, but Charles Correll and Freeman Gosden cast him as Amos. Since he had been hired a year before the show began, Gosden and Correll turned the search for an actor to play \\"The Kingfish\\" over to Childress. In a 1979 interview, Childress shared information about some of the candidates. Cab Calloway was considered but found wanting by Gosden because of his straight hair. Childress said there were many famous men, with and without actual acting experience, who wanted to play the role. Shortly after the television show had ended, plans to turn it into a vaudeville act were announced in 1953, with Childress, Williams and Moore playing the same roles as they had in the television series. It is not known if there were any performances. In 1956, after the television show was no longer in production, Childress and some of his fellow cast members: Tim Moore, Spencer Williams, and Lillian Randolph along with her choir, began a tour of the US as \\"The TV Stars of Amos 'n' Andy\\". The tour was halted by CBS as the network considered this an infringement of their rights to the program and its cast of characters. Despite the threats which ended the 1956 tour, Childress, along with Moore, Williams and Johnny Lee were able to perform one night in 1957 in Windsor, Ontario, apparently without legal action. When he tried for work as an actor, Childress found none as he was typecast as Amos Jones. For a short time, Childress found himself parking cars for an upscale Beverly Hills restaurant. Childress also appeared in roles on the television series Perry Mason, Sanford and Son, Good Times and The Jeffersons and in the films Thunderbolt and Lightfoot (1974) and The Day of the Locust (1975). When Childress appeared as a minister in a 1972 episode of Sanford and Son, he was reunited with two former cast members: Lillian Randolph of Amos 'n' Andy in the role of Aunt Hazel and Lance Taylor, Jr. of Anna Lucasta, with the role of Uncle Edgar. Childress's first wife was the former Alice Herndon, who established herself as a successful writer and actress under the name of Alice Childress (1916–1994); the couple was married from 1934 to 1957 and had a daughter, Jean Rosa. From 1961 to 1973, Childress worked as an unemployment interviewer for the Los Angeles Department of Personnel and in the Civil Service Commission of Los Angeles County. ==Death== Childress suffered from diabetes and other ailments. He died at age 78 on April 19, 1986, in Inglewood, California. He was buried at National Memorial Harmony Park in Landover, Maryland. ==Stage and screen credits== ;Selected stage credits *Savage Rhythm (1931) *Brown Sugar (1934) *Sweet Land (1936) *The Case of Philip Lawrence (1937) *Haiti (1938) *Hell's Alley (1938) *Natural Man (1941) *Two on an Island (1942) *Anna Lucasta (1944–46) *Striver's Row (1946) *The Amen Corner (1968) ;Selected screen credits *Hell's Alley (1931) *Harlem is Heaven (1932) *Out of the Crimson Fog (1932) *Dixie Love (1934) *Keep Punching (1939) *Anna Lucasta (1958) \\\\- Noah *The Man in the Net (1959) - Alonzo (uncredited) *High Time (1960) - Guest Announcer at Judge Carter's Ball (uncredited) *Thunderbolt and Lightfoot (1974) - Janitor *The Day of the Locust (1975) - Butler *Darktown Strutters (1975) - Bo *The Bingo Long Traveling All-Stars & Motor Kings (1976) - Horace Quigley, Owner of Atlanta Black Crackers *The Main Event (1979) - Man In Gym *Cheech and Chong's Next Movie (1980) - Pinochle Player ==References===Watch=== * Amos 'n' Andy: Anatomy of a Controversy Video on YouTube Category:1907 births Category:1986 deaths Category:Male actors from Mississippi Category:African-American male actors Category:American male film actors Category:American male stage actors Category:American male television actors Category:People from Meridian, Mississippi Category:20th-century American male actors Category:Rust College alumni Category:Burials at National Harmony Memorial Park ","title":"Alvin Childress"},{"id":"20525737","text":"Garfield's Pet Force is a 2009 direct-to-video computer animated comedy film based on characters from the Jim Davis comic strip Garfield and loosely based on the Pet Force novel series. It is the third and final installment of the trilogy that also includes Garfield Gets Real and Garfield's Fun Fest. It was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc on June 16, 2009. It was written by Garfield creator Jim Davis. It was released theatrically in 3-D in select countries such as Spain. ==Plot== On the planet Dorkon, Professor Wally (the professor counterpart to Wally, voiced by Neil Ross) shows Emperor Jon (the emperor counterpart to Jon Arbuckle, voiced by Wally Wingert) his new invention, the Moscram ray gun, a device powered by the Klopman crystal that can scramble inanimate objects and organisms into new creatures under the user's control. But Emperor Jon is concerned about finding a wife to continue the royal bloodline. Soon a warship lands outside the palace. Emperor Jon sees Vetvix (the super-villain counterpart to Liz), and asks her if he can marry her. She agrees, but only because she wanted to steal the Moscram Ray Gun. She zombifies Emperor Jon's guards, switching the guards' heads with each other. Professor Wally calls the Pet Force: Garzooka (Garfield's superhero counterpart, voiced by Frank Welker), who can spit green hairballs out of his mouth, Odious (Odie's superhero counterpart, voiced by Gregg Berger), who can whack and move objects with his powerful tongue, Abnermal (Nermal's superhero counterpart, voiced by Jason Marsden), who can run at an amazing speed and Starlena (Arlene's superhero counterpart, voiced by Audrey Wasilewski), who can freeze her enemies by staring at them. But Vetvix zombifies every member of the Pet Force except Garzooka. He manages to get hold of the Klopman Crystal and escapes with Professor Wally in a secret passageway. The professor uses his computer to search the universe for counterparts with DNA matches with the Pet Force. Professor Wally finds the counterparts, and gives Garzooka their pictures and some serums that will transform their counterparts into the Pet Force, and he flies away in his space ship to the Comic Strip World leaving Professor Wally behind with Vetvix vowing for revenge. The situation was revealed to be a comic book Nermal (Jason Marsden) was reading during a cookout with Jon (Wally Wingert) and the gang. Nermal is really excited about getting the next 100th edition issue. Garfield's friends go to the Comic studio to work their new strip, except Garfield (Frank Welker) who wants to finish all the hot dogs. Nermal gets the new Pet Force issue from a news stand, with Garzooka jumping out of a comic book afterwards. Nermal finds that the events that are happening to them are in the comic book, and the rest of the book is blank because they have not happened yet. Garzooka heads for Jon's house, and is told where Odie (Gregg Berger), Arlene (Audrey Wasilewski), and Nermal are by Garfield. Garzooka gives Garfield the Klopman crystal as well, telling him to protect it. In the living room at the Comic Studios, Nermal, Arlene, and Odie notice Garzooka behind them after Nermal reads the new comic book. Garzooka hands them the serums, asking them to help him stop Vetvix. But they don't change immediately after they drink the serums. However it's time for Odie, Arlene, and Nermal to go to work and Garzooka follows. Meanwhile, the real Garfield is enjoying a relaxing day all to himself, but is captured by Vetvix (who appeared in Comic Strip World earlier), who threatens him for the Klopman Crystal, but to no avail (because Garfield was a cartoon character). Garfield tried to protect the Klopman Crystal by putting it in his lemonade, and drinks it. But eventually Vetvix's guards get it. Garfield is told by Professor Wally to go over to Emperor Jon and him. He tells Garfield to grab the Professor's lens and puts them on the window. The sunlight burns the Emperor and the professor's ropes. Vetvix order her guards to get rid of Garfield, so they throw Garfield down the garbage chute. Back at Comic Studios, the gang is interrupted by Vetvix, who crashes her war ship into Comic Studios, and zombifies most of the characters at the studio. Nermal, Odie, Arlene, Jon, and Garzooka escape to the back alley. Garzooka is wondering why the serums haven't taken effect yet. He notices Garfield falling from the sky. Then Odie, Nermal, and Arlene turn into their Pet Force counterparts. They plan to bring down Vetvix's ship using the antenna on top of a 1000-foot tall tower, the tallest building in town nearby. Vetvix's ship backs up, causing a bill board to break to pieces. The Pet Force hide under one of the broken pieces of the bill board and escape while being chased by zombies and manage to reach the tower by crashing through walls. Garfield, Jon, and a cartoon trash can are the only ones left in the back alley. Eli (Greg Eagles) saves Garfield from Vetvix, by making the air vent suck him. Jon, however, gets his head and mind scrambled with the trashcan. Jon and the trashcan serve Vetvix and find Garzooka. Back in the city, citizens notice Vetvix firing the ray at various characters. Vetvix causes chaos, zombifying all of Cartoon World, as the citizens of the Comic Strip World try to make a run for it but were unsuccessful. Eli scolds Garfield for not helping Garzooka and if haven't been so lazy then Vetvix wouldn't have gotten the Klopman Crystal. Eli and Garfield manage to find three survivors: Wally (Neil Ross), Wally's wife Bonita (Jennifer Darling), and Betty. Garfield decides to name himself and the survivors \\"The Crazy Crew\\" and form their own plan to help Garzooka's crew and to stop Vetvix. Meanwhile, at the tower, Garzooka barricades the doors and claims that the Pet Force will be safe. The zombies break the windows and got inside of the tower, making the Pet Force make a run to the top. Garzooka realizes the zombies are too much for the Pet Force as the Pet Force starts to feel weakened and outnumbered. Luckily, Garfield and Wally pretend to be zombies, then disguised themselves as Garzooka (Garfield stands on top of Wally to make the fake Garzooka taller) and get the zombies attention, making the zombies think the Garzooka disguise is real. The real Garzooka and the Pet Force go to the antenna and use it to bring down Vetvix's ship. Meanwhile, the zombies chase Garfield and Wally to the Comic Studio, and Eil opens the pit in the filming area, in which the zombies fall into. Meanwhile, at the tower, Vetvix shoots the Moscram Ray Gun, using the super scramble mode, combining all the Pet Force members into one creature. However, they move in a different direction, and they fall off the tower. Emperor Jon and Professor Wally break free, and take over the ship, flying into the air, making Vetvix fall off. However, she makes a giant monster by shooting the ray gun at most of the buildings in the Cartoon World, and decides to use the monster to destroy almost everything and get her ship back. Meanwhile, Vetvix's ship (with Professor Wally and Emperor Jon controlling it) lands near the back alley of Comic Studio, and the Crazy Crew meet Emperor Jon and Professor Wally, who let Garfield enter the ship. The ship flies above the monster, and Garfield jumps off, just as the monster grabs the wings of the ship, wrecking it. The monster chases Garfield. During the chase, Garfield encounters the creature combined with the Pet Force members. They try to attack Garfield, but they miss and end up attacking the monster. Odie chases Garfield using his tongue. Garfield runs around the monsters, and the monster trips. Vetvix falls off and drops the gun. Garfield unscrambles the monster and the Pet Force. Garfield and the \\"Crazy Crew\\" surround Vetvix, and she backs up into a corner called the \\"Smile Section\\", which Betty invented. The \\"Smile Section\\" will make anyone who goes into it think of happy thoughts and smile. Garfield shoots Vetvix with the Moscram Ray Gun in the \\"Smile Section,\\" and Vetvix turns from evil to good. The new Vetvix apologizes about what she done to Emperor Jon, then Eli opens the pit and Garfield unscrambles the zombies. Garzooka gives the red serums to Arlene, Odie, and Nermal. Garfield gives The Moscram Ray Gun back to Professor Wally. Nermal misses having his super powers, so Garzooka gives him a matching costume. The Comic Studio crew, Garfield, his friends, and the Pet Force (on Dorkon) watch Vetvix and Emperor Jon's wedding, Garfield finally wins Arlene's feelings, and two gaze at the stars.

A log space transducer, M, has three tapes: * A read-only input tape. * A read/write work tape (bounded to at most O(\\\\log n) symbols). * A write-only, write-once output tape. M will be designed to compute a log-space computable function f\\\\colon \\\\Sigma^\\\\ast \\\\rightarrow \\\\Sigma^\\\\ast (where \\\\Sigma is the alphabet of both the input and output tapes). If M is executed with w on its input tape, when the machine halts, it will have f(w) remaining on its output tape.

(A reduces to B and B reduces to C implies A reduces to C). # If A reduces to B, and B is in L, then we know A is in L. Transitivity holds because it is possible to feed the output tape of one reducer (A->B) to another (B->C). At first glance, this seems incorrect because the A->C reducer needs to store the output tape from the A->B reducer onto the work tape in order to feed it into the B->C reducer, but this is not true. Each time the B->C reducer needs to access its input tape, the A->C reducer can re-run the A->B reducer, and so the output of the A->B reducer never needs to be stored entirely at once. ==References== *Szepietowski, Andrzej (1994), Turing Machines with Sublogarithmic Space , Springer Press, .

Pets were virtual goods apps for Facebook and MySpace originally created by Nikil Gandhy, Will Liu, and Jonathan Hsu. They launched less than one month after the creation of the Facebook Platform. Max Levchin's Slide acquired the application and its creators in 2007, with the application growing to become one of Facebook's most popular applications in terms of monthly active users. The application mimicked Facebook's own \\"poke\\" feature, adding new actions like smiles, winks, slaps, and “smacking” Facebook friends. At one point SuperPoke! allowed users to virtually “stab” friends; Facebook later asked Slide to remove this option. SuperPoke! differentiated itself from other applications by introducing characters such as a sheep, chicken and penguin. These characters were originally designed by Nikil Gandhy. Superpoke! was shut down on September 27, 2011 and SuperPoke! Pets closed March 7, 2012 == Shutdown of SuperPoke! Pets and subsequent lawsuit for loss of purchased virtual goods == In August 2010, Slide was acquired by Google, and almost a year later SuperPoke! Pets announced significant changes including removal of gold buying and quests. In September 2011, it was announced that SuperPoke! Pets would be shut down permanently beginning March 6, 2012. In 2012, the SuperPoke! Pets user community sued Google/Slide for shutting down SuperPoke! Pets after its players had invested an estimated $650 million of money in virtual goods that, with the shutdown of the app, would now expire worthless. The plaintiff's legal team wrote that Google's offer of a limited, \\"SuperPoke! Pets Lite\\" that eliminated access to virtual goods and interaction with pets was inadequate because it “entirely stripped the value from customers' original purchases,” rendering their virtual items as “effectively valueless” as users could no longer interact with each other on the secondary market or play with their virtual pets. Characterizing the virtual items they had purchased as “property,” they claimed that as a result of Slide/Google's actions, individual players lost access to an inventory of goods that had cost “hundreds or even thousands of dollars.” In 2013, the case was voluntarily dismissed by Abreu. ==References== Category:Facebook applications Category:Computer-related introductions in 2007 ","title":"SuperPoke!"},{"id":"20525954","text":"Shaban Tërstena (, , ) (born 1 January 1965), is a Macedonian Albanian former freestyle wrestler.

He lived in the second half of the 1st century and first half of the 2nd century CE in the Roman Empire. ==Family, Ancestry, and Early Life== Agrippa was a son of Cilician Prince Gaius Julius Agrippa (who served as a Quaestor for the Roman Province of Asia and before 109 served as a Praetorian Guard); his mother was a Roman woman who belonged or was related to the Fabian gens. His brother was a younger Gaius Julius Agrippa. Agrippa was of Jewish, Nabataean, Edomite, Greek, Armenian, Median and Persian origins. Through his paternal grandfather, Herodian Prince and King of Cetis Cilicia Gaius Julius Alexander, Agrippa was a descendant of King Archelaus of Cappadocia; King of Judea Herod the Great; his wife Mariamne and King Tigranes VI of Armenia. Through his paternal grandmother, Princess and Queen of Cetis Cilicia Julia Iotapa, he was a direct descendant of Greek King Antiochus IV of Commagene and his sister-wife Greek Queen Julia Iotapa. Agrippa was an apostate to Judaism. However, his name indicates that the family connections with the Herodian Dynasty were not wholly broken. It is unlikely but unknown if Agrippa attempted to exert influence on Judean politics. Agrippa lived in and became a citizen of Apamea in Western Syria. Little is known of his early life. In his career, Agrippa served as a gymnasiarch and a Pontifex Maximus. ==Work in Apamea== In 115, Apamea suffered a serious earthquake. During this crisis, Agrippa served as the city’s ambassador to Rome. At his own expense, Agrippa made various generous public benefactions to his community and frequently undertook embassies to the Roman Emperor and the Roman Senate. For six months, Agrippa paid for and distributed expensive olive oil for anointing and corn for public use in Apamea. With his wealth, Agrippa assisted in the reconstruction of Apamea in the following ways: * He financed the construction of an extension for the city’s aqueduct. * In 11617, he bought sufficient land and financed the construction of the baths, an adjacent large hall, and a stoa. The large hall and stoa had lavish decorations and was used for concerts and competitions in music or oratory. * He commissioned a number of bronze statues of Theseus and the Minotaur, as well as the ancient Greek god Apollo with the satyr Marsyas to be created. These statues were placed in the baths in Apamea which were part of a much larger complex. ==Legacy== There are a number of honorary inscriptions and decrees that have survived which were dedicated to Agrippa in Apamea and Rome. These honorary inscriptions and decrees date from 115118. On the façade of the baths, Agrippa dedicated an inscription to a Julius Bassus, a Pro-Praetorian Legatus in Apamea. Other inscriptions in consoles attached to the pillars of the baths are dedications by Agrippa’s slaves, freedmen, or clients. At the Capitoline Hill in Rome, there is a bronze inscription dedicated to Agrippa. This inscription in Rome reveals that he undertook numerous voluntary liturgies. Below is an honorary decree that has survived on a base of a statue of Agrippa. The decree reads: :Lucius Julius Gainius Fabius Agrippa :The honorand went to embassies at his own expense to the emperors, to Rome and to governors. ==Sources== *http://www.roman-emperors.org/philarab.htm * *Bash, Anthony (1997).

Several oversight mechanisms are established by the bill, including the Congressional Oversight Panel, the Special Inspector General for TARP (SIGTARP), the Financial Stability Oversight Board, and additional requirements for the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). ==Financial Stability Oversight Board (FSOB)== The Financial Stability Oversight Board was created to review and make recommendations regarding the Treasury's actions.Amendment to HR 1424 , Division A, Section 104. Its purpose is to review the operation of TARP, to make recommendations to the Treasury for improvements, and to watch for fraud and misrepresentation. The FSOB also has the power to ensure that the Treasury follows policies in accordance with the Act and the economic interest of the U.S. It is to meet on a monthly basis and report to Congress and the Oversight Panel quarterly.Nothwehr, E.

The Congressional Oversight Panel was charged with the job of reviewing the state of the markets, current regulatory system, and the Treasury Department's management of the Troubled Asset Relief Program. The panel was required to report their findings to Congress every 30 days, counting from the first asset purchase made under the program. The panel was also required to submit a special report to Congress about regulatory reform on or before January 20, 2009.Amendment to HR 1424 , Division A, Section 125. The Congressional Oversight Panel was initially scheduled cease to exist on December 31, 2009, though it was later renewed through early 2011.Section 125 references Section 120 for its termination date, and section 120 states terminates December 31, 2009, unless renewed by a letter from the Secretary. The panel consisted of five outside experts appointed as follows: * One member chosen by the Speaker of the House (Nancy Pelosi selected Richard H. Neiman on November 14, 2008easybourse.com ) * One member chosen by the minority leader of the House (John Boehner appointed Jeb Hensarling on November 19, 2008) * One member chosen by the majority leader of the Senate (Harry Reid appointed Elizabeth Warren on November 14, 2008) * One member chosen by the minority leader of the Senate (Mitch McConnell appointed John E. Sununu on December 17, 2008 after his original choice Judd Gregg had \\"stepped aside\\" December 1http://www.politicker.com/new-hampshire/14766/sununu-appointed-oversight- panel). * One member chosen by the Speaker of the House and the majority leader of the Senate, following consultation with the minority leaders of Congress (Damon Silvershttp://blog.aflcio.org/2008/11/19/afl-cio-silvers- named-by-congress-to-panel-reporting-on-bailout was appointed on November 14) The first meeting of this board was held Wednesday, November 25, 2008, and elected Elizabeth Warren as the chairperson and Damon Silvers as deputy chairperson. As no assets had yet been purchased, (OFS instead chose to provide $250 billion to banks through the Capital Purchase Program) it is not clear whether the requirement to report after 30 days from \\"first asset purchase\\" has been violated. On December 8, 2009, the government's financial bailout program concluded in a year-end review that, despite flaws and lingering problems, the program “can be credited with stopping an economic panic.” Also on this date, Rep. Jeb Hensarling stepped down from the panel, submitting his letter of resignation. Hensarling was replaced by Mark McWatters, a Dallas lawyer and certified public accountant who has served as an advisor to Hensarling. On October 1, 2010, Senator Ted Kaufman of Delaware was appointed by Majority Leader Reid to replace Warren on the panel, as Warren resigned to focus on her duties at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Three days later, Kaufman was unanimously elected as the panel's second chairperson. Kaufman was succeeded in Congress by Senator Chris Coons on November 15, 2010, but he remained chairperson of the Congressional Oversight Panel until its dissolution in 2011. ==Government Accountability Office (GAO)== The Comptroller General (director of the Government Accountability Office) is required to monitor the performance of the program, and report findings to Congress every 60 days. The Comptroller General is also required to audit the program annually. The bill grants the Comptroller General access to all information, records, reports, data, etc. belonging to or in use by the program.Sweet, Lynn. \\"Bailout bill 'Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008' searchable summary\\" , Chicago Sun-Times, September 28, 2008.Amendment to HR 1424 , Division A, Section 116. On December 2, 2008, GAO released their first report on the bailout.text of the report from gao.gov Neel Kashkari, the OFS chairman, said in a letter to GAO that the department agrees with the report's findings and most of its recommendations but questioned GAO's suggestion to require more reporting from banks, saying gathering specifics from individual banks might not be the best way to evaluate the program. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called the report's findings \\"discouraging\\" and stated that the report shows the program \\"is not accountable to American taxpayers.\\" ==Special Inspector General for TARP (SIGTARP)== The EESA created the Office of the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (SIGTARP), and the Special Inspector General is appointed by the President and confirmed by the U.S. Senate. The Special Inspector General's purpose is to monitor, audit, and investigate TARP-related activities, including those of the Treasury in the administration of the program, and report findings to Congress every quarter.Amendment to HR 1424 , Division A, Section 121. Christy Romero was sworn-in as the current Special Inspector General on April 9, 2012, having been nominated by the President on February 1, 2012, and confirmed by the U.S. Senate on March 29, 2012.http://www.sigtarp.gov/Press%20Releases/Romero_Installation_Press_Release.pdf Eric Thorson is the Inspector General of the US Department of the Treasury and was originally responsible for the oversight of the TARP but expressed concerns about the difficulty of properly overseeing the complex program in addition to his regular responsibilities. Thorson called oversight of TARP a \\"mess\\" and later clarified this to say \\"The word 'mess' was a description of the difficulty my office would have in providing the proper level of oversight of the TARP while handling its growing workload, including conducting audits of certain failed banks and thrifts at the same time that efforts are underway to nominate a special inspector general.\\" Former Special Inspector General Neil Barofsky was confirmed by the Senate on December 8, 2008, and was sworn into office on December 15, 2008. Barofsky stepped down from the post on March 30, 2011. Prior to assuming the position of Special Inspector General, Barofsky was a federal prosecutor in the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York for more than eight years. Barofsky received the Attorney General's John Marshall Award for his work on the Refco matter. Barofsky also led the investigation that resulted in the indictment of the top 50 leaders of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) on narcotics charges, a case described by the then Attorney General as the largest narcotics indictment filed in U.S. history.http://www.sigtarp.gov/about_ig.shtml Under the leadership of Mr. Barofsky, the Office of the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program has quietly turned into a full-fledged financial law enforcement agency. It has 45 investigators who are empowered to carry guns and badges, and 27 vehicles with sirens and lights spread out in its branch offices across the United States. SIGTARP agents are empowered to make arrests. The agency is currently engaged in 142 ongoing criminal and civil investigations, and it has already recovered assets worth $151.8 million. By the summer of 2010, SIGTARP agents were participating in raids alongside other U.S. law enforcement agencies. They worked with FBI agents in a raid on Colonial Bank in Orlando, Florida in an investigation into possible TARP- related fraud.https://www.cnbc.com/id/41975030 In January 2012, Special Inspector General Christy Romero said some $133 billion remained to be repaid by participants in the program, of which some at least is not likely ever to be repaid or recouped. That figure was offset partly by some $40.3 billion income and profits from repaid loans and investments; however new home- foreclosure bailout programs that could last as late as 2017 could also cost an additional $50 billion or more.Gordon, Marcy, \\"Report: Taxpayers still owed $133B from bailout\\", Associated Press via Atlanta Journal-Constitution, January 26, 2012. Retrieved 2012-01-26. SIGTARP has been described as having a staff of 170, an annual budget of $41 million, and a substantial law- enforcement record. As of late 2013, SIGTARP had \\"pursued criminal charges against 107 senior bank officers, most of whom have been sentenced to prison.\\" ==TARP oversight reportsCOP reports=== * Commercial Real

What was it spent on? How much is being held in savings, and what's the plan for the rest? None of the banks provided specific answers... Some banks said they simply didn't know where the money was going.\\"Where'd the bailout money go?

GAO, Opportunities Exist to Strengthen Policies and Processes for Managing Emergency Assistance, GAO-11-696. Table 8 (page 131), 2011. In assessing the audit, the Levy Institute estimated the bailout cost at $29 trillion (Levy Institute, Working Paper No. 698, December 2011, $29,000,000,000,000: A Detailed Look at the Fed’s Bailout by Funding Facility and Recipient). Amounts and recipients include Citigroup: $2.5 trillion, Morgan Stanley: $2.04 trillion, Merrill Lynch: $1.949 trillion, Bank of America: $1.344 trillion, Bear Sterns: $853 billion, Goldman Sachs: $814 billion, Lehman $183 billion. Barclays PLC (United Kingdom): $868 billion Royal Bank of Scotland (UK): $541 billion, JP Morgan Chase: $391 billion, Deutsche Bank (Germany): $354 billion, UBS (Switzerland): $287 billion, Credit Suisse (Switzerland): $262 billion, Lehman Brothers: $183 billion, Bank of Scotland (United Kingdom): $181 billion, BNP Paribas (France): $175 billion. ==AIG and Federal Reserve Intentionally Withheld Counterparty Payments in AIG Bailout from Public Disclosure== The “extraordinary” withholding of disclosure of the AIG bailout is detailed in US House of Representatives, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Public Disclosure as a Last Resort: How the Federal Reserve Fought to Cover Up the Details of the AIG Counterparties Bailout from the American People, Special Report, US House, January 25, 2010. When the SEC sought full disclosure of the amounts and recipients the FRBNY responded that this “requirement is giving us some pause, since we haven’t otherwise disclosed this information to Congress.” The “FRBNY clearly hoped to prevent Congress from fully understanding the payments to AIG’s counterparties” (pg 13). The Committee concluded that the “fact that a quasi-government agency, unaccountable to the American people, likely wasted billions of taxpayer dollars and went to great lengths to prevent Congress and the American people from learning about these actions demonstrates the threat that the Federal Reserve poses to basic principles of American democracy.” (emphasis added) ==Oversight effortsXBRL proposed as tool to aid in TARP oversight=== At the Domestic Policy Subcommittee hearing of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee on March 11, 2009, XBRL was proposed as a mechanism for automating the data entry and processing of financial filings to aid in TARP oversight.http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/xbrl-us-testifies-domestic- policy/story.aspx?guid={44E803FE-0A15-4E0E-BA03-CD0CDC0FAC13}&dist;=msr_4 ==References== Category:Troubled Asset Relief Program Category:United States Inspectors General ","title":"Oversight of the Troubled Asset Relief Program"},{"id":"20525976","text":"Brian Wheeler, commonly known by the nickname \\"Wheels\\", was the play-by-play radio announcer for the Portland Trail Blazers of the National Basketball Association from 1998 to 2019 and former host of a daily radio program. ==BiographyEarly years=== Wheeler grew up in Southern California, where he was exposed at an early age to some of the most revered voices in sports broadcasting history, including Vin Scully of the Los Angeles Dodgers and Chick Hearn of the Los Angeles Lakers. Wheeler attended Loyola University in Chicago, where he earned a degree in Broadcasting and Communications. ===Early broadcast career=== Brian Wheeler began his radio career as a broadcaster for his alma mater, Loyola University Chicago, where he called play-by-play for soccer, women's softball, and basketball for station WLUW-FM. Wheeler went on to work in a series of broadcasting jobs in Chicago, including time working for Northwestern University, the Chicago White Sox, and SportsChannel. He worked for the NBA's Chicago Bulls during their first championship season. Wheeler moved from Chicago to Seattle, Washington, to take a job working for the Seattle SuperSonics, remaining there for two seasons, also hosting a radio talk show on the team's flagship radio station, KJR. Wheeler later worked as a broadcaster for the WNBA team the Sacramento Monarchs, also hosting pre-game and post-game shows for the Sacramento Kings of the National Basketball Association. ===Career in Portland === In 1998, Wheeler came to Portland, Oregon to take a job as radio play-by-play announcer for the NBA's Portland Trail Blazers. Wheeler was placed in the difficult position of replacing broadcaster Bill Schonely, the team's radio play-by-play announcer since its inaugural season in 1970–71—a situation which he later likened to entering a \\"hornets' nest\\". Wheeler was able to put distance between himself and Schonely by adhering to the promise made to his new employers to call games \\"like a fan would call them\\". The resulting mixture of shrill \\"homerism\\" and forthright honesty soon found its niche with fans. Wheeler is best known for his frenetic style, loud and passionate delivery, and trademark calls such as \\"BOOM-SHAKA- LAKA!\\" following energetic Trail Blazer dunks and hard to sink shots. During his radio broadcasts he's also known to call out energy driven lines such as: \\"Yes sir!\\", \\"Ring it up!\\" and \\"Ooh, that was nasty!\\". Whenever former Blazer Nicholas Batum made a dunk, however, he replaced his \\"BOOM-SHAKA-LAKA!\\" call with \\"BATUM-SHAKA-LAKA!\\". After the final play of each Trail Blazer win, Wheeler concludes by saying, \\"And once again we can say: It's a great day to be a Blazer!\\" Wheeler's radio partner in the role of analyst was former Trail Blazer player Antonio Harvey, up through the conclusion of the 2015 season. Wheeler became the sole radio broadcaster in 2016, with occasional appearances from former Blazer Brian Grant. Wheeler hosted a daily radio talk show on KXTG-FM 95.5 The Game called Wheels at Work(originally \\"Wheels After Work\\"). In September 2010, Wheeler announced that he would step down from the Wheels at Work radio show to spend more time working on the Blazers broadcast side of his life. During the 2018/19 season, Wheeler missed broadcasting the majority of the Trail Blazers games due to health issues. On July 12, 2019 the Trail Blazers president and CEO issued the following statement, \\"Brian Wheeler has been an integral part of the broadcast team and Trail Blazers family since 1998 and his voice is synonymous with all the many great play-by-play calls over that 21-year span,\\" said Trail Blazers president and CEO Chris McGowan. \\"We thank Brian for his contributions to the franchise and wish him all the best in his future endeavors.\\" Wheeler, issued the following response, On September 9, 2019, the Portland Trail Blazers announced they hired Travis Demers to be the team's new radio voice. In addition, he is a \\"Sports Broadcasting\\" course instructor for the online sports career training school Sports Management Worldwide in Portland. ==FootnotesExternal links== *Brian Wheeler biography at Trail Blazers.com * Peter Fornatale, \\"Extensive Interview with Portland Trail Blazers Radio Voice Brian Wheeler,\\" Blazers Edge, April 15, 2013. www.blazersedge.com/ Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:American sports announcers Category:Portland Trail Blazers broadcasters Category:Basketball announcers Category:Loyola University Chicago alumni Category:Radio personalities from Portland, Oregon Category:Sacramento Kings broadcasters Category:Chicago White Sox broadcasters Category:College football announcers Category:College basketball announcers in the United States Category:Seattle SuperSonics broadcasters ","title":"Brian Wheeler"},{"id":"20525984","text":"Bulimia Banquet was an American punk band with members from Downtown Los Angeles, Hollywood, Hermosa Beach, and El Segundo, California, United States. They formed in 1986. Fronted by guitarist Ingrid Baumgart and bassist Jula Bell, the band is regarded as one of the forerunners of the riot grrrl movement of the 1990s. The band released two albums and disbanded in 1991. ==HistoryFormation=== Bulimia Banquet traces its roots to an earlier band, Minions of Parody, which existed in Southern California in 1985.Al Kowalewski and Joe Henderson, \\"Bulimia Banquet,\\" Flipside, whole no. 52 (Spring 1987), pp. 6-7. The band featured two future members of Bulimia Banquet — bassist and vocalist Jula Bell and guitarist Alan Hansford. Bell, an opera aficionado who studied the musical form at Boston University and USC, began playing informally with guitarist Ingrid Baumgart. When another guitarist and drummer was needed, the duo called upon Hansford and Greg Cameron (SWA). The band Bulimia Banquet was born in 1986. They then had Nick Passiglia (Nip Drivers) playing drums for a few gigs, until they hired Jason Greenwood to play drums. Greenwood was formerly of the San Francisco band Playing Under the Influence and was only 15 when he joined the band Bulimia Banquet's lyrics were primarily written by its female vocalists, Baumgart and Bell, with all members of the band contributing to the writing of original music. ===Musical importance=== Bulimia Banquet is recognized for pioneering the riot grrrl movement of the 1990s, and is featured in a 1995 documentary film by Lisa Rose Apramian, Not Bad for a Girl.David Hinckley, \\"Female Musicians Ponder Rock'n'Roles,\\" New York Daily News, Nov. 11, 1996. The band played an intense style, which it described in a 1987 Flipside interview as \\"silly, fast, rockin', wild.\\" The band was dismissive of all-women bands that took a soft, melodic pop approach, as band leader Jula Bell noted: > \\"Stupid, feathery girl bands — I hate that. We've seen all of that. I don't > want people looking at me for my body, looking at me going, 'Look at that, I > want to fuck that.' I'm not up there for that.... It's not right. If we want > an egalitarian world you gotta be androgynous.... I'm not talking about the > new wave androgyny, I'm talking girls are tough, and guys...can be feminine. > There's a balance.\\" ===Other personnel=== Mia Ferraro, Dez Cadena, Steve Drojensky, and Travis Johnson were also in the band for a period of time.Interview with Travis Johnson , thedickies.com/ ===Break up and later projects=== Bulimia Banquet released two albums, a single, and tracks for compilation albums. The band's final release appeared in 1991. Jula Bell has been featured in a number of other local bands including Nip Drivers, Bobsled, and Marc Spitz Freestyle. She has done punk rock autoharp solo gigs and has also played autoharp in the L.A. based rock group, Miss Derringer.[ Bulimia Banquet], AllMusic Ingrid Baumgart was in the all female punk band, Raszebrae and Malicious Grind. Bell was featured singing with Devo in the Tank Girl film in 1995, in the opening sequence song \\"Girl U Want\\". Jason Greenwood was also in the T.V.T.V's (Flipside Records) and Punk Rock Vato's with Jamie Pina (Chemical People), Pat Hoed (aka. Adam Bomb), and Rick Agnew (the Adolescents, Christian Death). In June 2018, Greenwood died of a drug overdose at the age of 46. ==DiscographyAlbums=== * Eat Fats, Die Young (1986, Flipside Records) * Party My Colon (1989, Flipside Records) ===7-inch vinyl=== * Curse Me 7\\" (1991, Piece of Mind) ===Compilations=== * Flipside Vinyl Fanzine (1987, Flipside Records) * Gabba Gabba Hey - A Tribute to the Ramones - (1991, Triple X Records) * Welcome to our Nightmare\\"- A Tribute to Alice Cooper -Triple X Records ===Videos=== *Dine or Die ==ReferencesExternal links== *Bulimia Banquet on Last FM *Jula Bell Category:Punk rock groups from California Category:Musical groups established in 1986 Category:Musical groups disestablished in 1991 ","title":"Bulimia Banquet"},{"id":"20525987","text":"is a Japanese professional baseball player.

He was a close friend of Theodulf of Orléans, a contemporary and courtier of the emperors Charlemagne and Louis the Pious, and a member of the Palatine Academy. In signing his own poems he used the nom de plume Naso in reference to the cognomen of Ovid. From 815 (or earlier) until his death he was the Bishop of Autun. ==Ecclesiastical career== Moduin's early career in the church was spent at Saint-Georges in Lyon. He is first recorded in the diocese of Autun in 815, but it is not certain when he was elected or consecrated. He supported Louis the Pious and Charles the Bald during the civil wars of the 830s.There is an obscure reference in \\"Moduin,\\" Cyclopaedia of Biblical, Theological, and Ecclesiastical Literature, John McClintock and James Strong, edd. (New York: Harper), to Charles conquering Aquitaine from Pepin I and then dividing the government of his realm between three capitals: Limoges, Clermont, and Angoulême; the ecclesiastical division of Clermont being given to Moduin. After the deposition of Agobard at the Synod of Thionville in 835, Moduin took over many of the responsibilities of the Archbishop of Lyon. It was during his administration of Lyon that Florus accused him of mistreating the clergy. Moduin may also have been the abbot of Moutiers-Saint-Jean in the Diocese of Langres. ==Literature== Moduin was a court poet and as such his two surviving verses are secular. He is notable for his praise of Charlemagne and he has been called his panegyrist.Godman, 45-46. Moduin's poem to Theodulf and especially his Egloga were a major influence on the later Carolingian poet Ermoldus Nigellus. Even Moduin's more famous contemporary Alcuin of York, quotes Moduin in his En tuus Albinus.He attributes the line \\"Presbyter est Corydon\\" to a certain Naso, probably Moduin, cf. Godman, 18 and 122-3. The two books of Moduin's Egloga, about the value of poetry, are traditionally dated to 804-10, before the poem Karolus Magnus et Leo Papa usually attributed to Einhard.See Peter Godman (1985), Latin Poetry of the Carolingian Renaissance (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press), 190-97, for the first part of the Egloga (\\"Poetry and the new age\\") in both Latin and English. He shows, 196, that lines 87-8 do not imply that Alcuin (†809) was dead when the poem was written. For the full poem, see MGH, Poetae latini, I, 385ff. \\"Nasonis Ecloga\\". Stella (2004), after Peter Dronke, supposes that Moduin is the author of the Karolus Magnus et Leo Papa (or De Karolo rege et Leone papa, as Schaller has shown the textual title to be). The Egloga are modelled after the eclogues of Virgil and Calpurnius and likewise designed as a vehicle for praising the emperor, the Augustus. The poem is a lively debate between two unnamed men--a young poet, the puer, and an old poet, the senex--that mirrors Virgil's Tityrus and Meliboeus. The identification of the young poet with Moduin himself is purely speculative.Godman, 190. The first book begins with the youth's unsophisticated attempts to praise his older counterpart and to laud the \\"rebirth of 'golden Rome'\\". This last attempt has been often misread as a \\"manifesto of the Carolingian Renaissance\\", but in fact the senex ridicules it.Godman, 25 and n45. Cf. also Schaller. It contains, nonetheless, some of the most explicit \\"renaissance\\" imagery of the period: Aurea Roma iterum renovata renascitur orbi (\\"Golden Rome is reborn and restored anew to the world!\\").G. W. Trompf (1973), \\"The Concept of the Carolingian Renaissance,\\" Journal of the History of Ideas, 34(1), 21. The Latin and the translation are from Godman, 192-3.

The existence of private law tort applying to public bodies is a result of Diceyan constitutional theory suggesting that it would be unfair if a separate system of liability existing for government and officials. Therefore a public body which acts ultra vires is liable in tort is a cause of action can be established just like any individual would be. An ultra vires action will not, per se, give rise to damages Therefore a claimant will have to fit into one of the recognised private law courses of action. These areas in which a public body can incur private liability in tort were described by Lord Browne Wilkinson in X v Bedfordshire County Council [1995] 3 All ER 353 (HL). *1. Breach of a statutory duty *2. An action for breach of a common law duty of care *3. Misfeasance in public office It is not enough that there is a careless performance of a statutory duty in the absence of any other common law right of action. ==Breach of statutory duty== For an action for breach of statutory duty to succeed: *1. The Court must believe that this accords with the intention of Parliament. *2. The plaintiff must fall within the class of persons that the statute was supposed to protect. *3. The plaintiff must suffer consequential damage. *4. There must be no other possible remedy. ==Breach of a common law duty of care (negligence)== It is possible for a public authority to be liable in the law of negligence. There can be no liability here for mere carelessness performance of a statutory duty or power in the absence of any other common law right of action. A policy/operational distinction was once apparent in the court's reasoning. They suggested that they are more willing to attach liability to an act or omission of a public authority where the duty of care claimed emerges from the operation of the public authority rather than the policy pursued by it. So, for example, in the Dorset Yacht case the House of Lords decided that if the damage caused by a group of “borstal boys” had been the result of a policy decision to grant them greater freedom, it would not be actionable. If it were actionable, it would require the assessment of the policy, its impact on young offenders, the public, and public resources, a task which the court could not undertake. However, liability could be found where the public authority had been negligent in the exercise of the policy (i.e. negligent in the context of allowing greater freedom to young offenders). This reasoning was also adopted in the case of Anns v Merton. On the one hand, if the claimant had suffered damage as a result of a faulty inspection, that would be actionable operational negligence. On the other hand, it would be insufficient to show that structural flaws in the property would have been found if more inspections had taken place, if the lack of inspections was the result of a policy by the public authority. In the latter case the claim would not be actionable. However, the distinction now plays a relatively minor role in definition the duty of care owed by public authorities. The distinction now forms just one factor in deciding whether a decision is justiciable or non- justiciable, which is a decision to be taken by the court regardless of the views of the public authority itself. It is now more common to limit public authority liability on the basis of other factors. The test for liability in negligence laid down in Anns v Merton (concerning the liability of both public and private defendants) was disapproved in the subsequent case of Caparo Industries v Dickman, with the result that the extent of the duty of care of public authority defends would primarily result from asking whether it would be \\"fair, just and reasonable\\" to impose liability. In relation to public authority defendants, a wide range of factors would be considered including relevant statutes and a wide range of policy factors. The role of justiciability is therefore much less significant, although it can still influence a decision on whether liability is fair, just and reasonable. The extent of liability in different areas has therefore been decided by a string of cases examining where it would be fair, just and reasonable to impose liability. In Hill v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire, it was decided that the police owed no general duty of care to potential victims of crime. A determining factor was that the House of Lords believed that it was the discretion of a chief police officer to decide how available resources should be deployed and which leads should be acted upon and which possibilities ruled out. The House was also not prepared to risk the possibility of encouraging \\"defensive\\" policing whereby the police would shun any potential for liability even where to do so would further the case. The court in Capital and Counties plc v Hampshire County Council decided that a fire brigade only owed a duty of care to the owners of the property to which it responded to avoid doing damage to the property which would not otherwise occur. In this instance, the relationship was insufficiently proximate, another, separate, requirement of Caparo test. This conclusion was extended also to the coastguard in an analogous case. ==Misfeasance in public office== Misfeasance in public office is considered to be a special kind of public law tort. It occurs when there is a malicious or deliberate exercise or non-exercise of a statutory or common law power by an official which causes loss to a plaintiff which has been foreseen. ==Key cases== * Anns v Merton London Borough Council * Home Office v Dorset Yacht * X and others (minors) v Bedfordshire County Council ==See also== *English tort law *United Kingdom administrative law ==References== Category:English tort law Category:Public liability Category:United Kingdom administrative law ","title":"Administrative liability in English law"},{"id":"20526128","text":"Brooks F.

He has illustrated many collectible card games, including Magic: The Gathering and Dune, as well as books and magazines. He lives in Pennsylvania.Artist and Illustrator Mark Zug == Biography == Artist Mark Zug has been drawing from his childhood. He discovered his passion for painting to bring to life things not available to the senses - dinosaurs, superheroes, Jules-Vernean submarines, imaginary cars, races of ancient astronauts, starships inspired by then-fresh Star Trek etc. Turning continuously to fiction for inspiration, he discovered the authors Frank Herbert and Tolkien as a teen. Then giving his art a perhaps-needed break after high school, he started working as a class-A machinist at a nearby factory while experimenting with a musical career. == Rise to prominence== He returned to art, inspired by Frank Frazetta and illustrators of the Brandywine School. In 1985 he returned to art and started painting in oil, and attended art school for 2.5 years (no diploma). He capped his tutorial by ghost-painting western novel covers and penciling historical comic strips on the side. His first big break came in 1992 illustrating Harlan Ellison's I, Robot: The Illustrated Screenplay, for which he also did 160 pages of fully painted comics. He fulfilled a long-held dream illustrating Frank Herbert's Dune universe - in the form of Last Unicorn's collectible card game of the same name, which proved a springboard into game illustration. ==Present== His works have appeared on the covers of famous novels by famous authors like Tanith Lee, Diana Wynne Jones, Hilari Bell, the Dragonlance series, Star Wars comics, the magazines Popular Science, Dragon, Dungeon, Duelist, Inquest, Star Wars Gamer, Amazing Stories, and graced many fantasy game products and brands like Shadowrun, Battletech, Dune, and Magic: The Gathering.Magic: the Gathering cards illustrated by Mark Zug He has also done cover artwork for novels by Angie Sage.

His tenure is thought to be the longest of any religious leader in the region. He built up a Jewish community of 6,000-7,000 Torah-observant Jews in a country of 3 million. ==Early life== Levy was born in Jerusalem shortly after his parents immigrated to Israel from Morocco. His father was Rabbi Yaakov Levy, a noted kabbalist at Beit El Yeshiva.\\"News from the Torah World: Rav Tzion (Bentzion Rachamim) Levy, Rov of Panama\\" (24 November 2008). Levy studied at Porat Yosef Yeshiva. ==As Chief Rabbi== He arrived in Panama in 1951 at the urging of the Jerusalem beth din. The Rabbi performed many religious tasks while the community was beginning to expand. Some of his work included: officiating Jewish marriages, authorizing Kosher foods, slaughtering animals under the proper Jewish regulations, conducting Jewish circumcisions (Brit Milah), and writing Sifrei Torah and Mezuzot. Overall, Rabbi Levy did most of the work by himself. Levy built up the Shevet Ahim Congregation and community in Panama. To prevent power struggles between community factions and himself, Levy established himself as the sole Torah authority. He also laid down the conversion law immediately: No conversions will be performed in Panama, ruling that all converts must undergo conversions in Orthodox rabbinical courts outside Panama and then be subject to a two-year probation period in Panama, where they would have to prove their commitment to a Torah lifestyle. In his later years, Levy oversaw the construction of new synagogues in Panama City and worked to smooth relations with the country’s Arab and Muslim communities. He frequently phoned the country’s imam for a talk. By the time of his death, the Shevet Ahim community numbered 10,000 Jews, 6,000 of whom are Torah-observant. The community included several synagogues, mikvahs, three Jewish schools, a yeshiva, a kollel, and a girls' seminary, along with several kosher butchers. ==Death== Mikveh in Lod, Israel, named after Zion Levy and his wife. Levy suffered from ill health for several years. In October 2008, he felt unwell and was visited by two physicians from Israel's Tel Hashomer Hospital. The doctors found him in critical condition and recommended that he be flown to Israel to Tel Hashomer. His condition improved initially, but on the evening of 23 November 2008 he succumbed to his illness at the age of 83. He was eulogized at Porat Yosef Yeshiva. Levy was survived by his sons, David and Haim Levy. His wife, Rubissa Sarah Levy, died shortly after Zion Levy's Death. Haim Levy, a resident of Jerusalem, took over his father's post in Panama as Chief Rabbi. He later resigned the post, and returned to Israel. ==References== Category:1925 births Category:2008 deaths Category:20th-century rabbis Category:21st-century rabbis Category:Panamanian Jews Category:People from Jerusalem Category:Burials at Har HaMenuchot Category:Israeli people of Moroccan-Jewish descent Category:Panamanian people of Israeli descent Category:Panamanian people of Moroccan-Jewish descent Category:Israeli Jews Category:Panamanian religious leaders Category:Mohel ","title":"Zion Levy"},{"id":"20526283","text":"Mount Mariveles is a dormant volcano and the highest point in the province of Bataan in the Philippines.

The DQZ transform is the product of the Clarke transform and the Park transform, first proposed in 1929 by Robert H. Park.R.H. Park Two Reaction Theory of Synchronous Machines AIEE Transactions 48:716–730 (1929). The DQZ transform is often used in the context of electrical engineering with three- phase circuits. The transform can be used to rotate the reference frames of ac waveforms such that they become dc signals. Simplified calculations can then be carried out on these dc quantities before performing the inverse transform to recover the actual three-phase ac results. As an example, the DQZ transform is often used in order to simplify the analysis of three-phase synchronous machines or to simplify calculations for the control of three-phase inverters. In analysis of three-phase synchronous machines the transformation transfers three-phase stator and rotor quantities into a single rotating reference frame to eliminate the effect of time-varying inductances. ==Introduction== The DQZ transform is made of the Park and Clarke transformation matrices. The Clarke transform (named after Edith Clarke) converts vectors in the ABC reference frame to the αβγ reference frame. The primary value of the Clarke transform is isolating that part of the ABC-referenced vector which is common to all three components of the vector; it isolates the common-mode component (i.e., the Z component). The power-invariant, right-handed, uniformly-scaled Clarke transformation matrix is :K_{C} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2}{3}}\\\\cdot\\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & -\\\\frac{1}{2} & -\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{3}}{2} & -\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}} & \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}} & \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}} \\\\end{bmatrix}. To convert an ABC-referenced column vector to the XYZ reference frame, the vector must be pre-multiplied by the Clarke transformation matrix: : \\\\vec{u}_{XYZ} = K_{C}\\\\cdot \\\\vec{u}_{ABC} . And, to convert back from an XYZ- referenced column vector to the ABC reference frame, the vector must be pre- multiplied by the inverse Clarke transformation matrix: : \\\\vec{u}_{ABC} = K_{C}^{-1}\\\\cdot \\\\vec{u}_{XYZ} . The Park transform (named after Robert H. Park) converts vectors in the XYZ reference frame to the DQZ reference frame. The primary value of the Park transform is to rotate the reference frame of a vector at an arbitrary frequency. The Park transform shifts the frequency spectrum of the signal such that the arbitrary frequency now appears as \\"dc\\" and the old dc appears as the negative of the arbitrary frequency. The Park transformation matrix is :K_{P} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\cos{\\\\left(\\\\theta\\\\right)} & \\\\sin{\\\\left(\\\\theta\\\\right)} & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ -\\\\sin{\\\\left(\\\\theta\\\\right)} & \\\\cos{\\\\left(\\\\theta\\\\right)} & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\end{bmatrix}, where θ is the instantaneous angle of an arbitrary ω frequency. To convert an XYZ-referenced vector to the DQZ reference frame, the column vector signal must be pre- multiplied by the Park transformation matrix: : u_{DQZ} = K_{P}\\\\cdot u_{XYZ} . And, to convert back from a DQZ-referenced vector to the XYZ reference frame, the column vector signal must be pre-multiplied by the inverse Park transformation matrix: : u_{XYZ} = K_{P}^{-1}\\\\cdot u_{DQZ} .

And, to convert back from a DQZ-referenced vector to the ABC reference frame, the column vector signal must be pre-multiplied by the inverse DQZ transformation matrix: : u_{ABC} = K_{CP}^{-1}\\\\cdot u_{DQZ} . To really understand this transform better, a derivation of the transform is included. ==DerivationThe Park transform derivation=== The Park transform is based on the concept of the dot product and projections of vectors onto other vectors. First, let us imagine two unit vectors, \\\\hat{u}_{D} and \\\\hat{u}_{Q} (the unit vectors, or axes, of the new reference frame from the perspective of the old reference frame), and a third, arbitrary, vector \\\\vec{v}_{XY}. We can define the two unit vectors and the arbitrary vector in terms of their Cartesian coordinates in the old reference frame: :\\\\hat{u}_{D} = \\\\cos{\\\\left(\\\\theta\\\\right)}\\\\hat{u}_{X} \\\\+ \\\\sin{\\\\left(\\\\theta\\\\right)}\\\\hat{u}_{Y} :\\\\hat{u}_{Q} = -\\\\sin{\\\\left(\\\\theta\\\\right)}\\\\hat{u}_{X} \\\\+ \\\\cos{\\\\left(\\\\theta\\\\right)}\\\\hat{u}_{Y} :\\\\vec{v}_{XY} = v_{X}\\\\hat{u}_{X} \\\\+ v_{Y}\\\\hat{u}_{Y}, where \\\\hat{u}_{X} and \\\\hat{u}_{Y} are the unit basis vectors of the old coordinate system and \\\\theta is the angle between the \\\\hat{u}_{X} and \\\\hat{u}_{D} unit vectors (i.e., the angle between the two reference frames). The projection of the arbitrary vector onto each of the two new unit vectors implies the dot product: :v_{D} = \\\\hat{u}_{D}\\\\cdot \\\\vec{v}_{XY} ::\\\\to \\\\cos{\\\\left(\\\\theta\\\\right)} v_{X} \\\\+ \\\\sin{\\\\left(\\\\theta\\\\right)} v_{Y} :v_{Q} = \\\\hat{u}_{Q}\\\\cdot \\\\vec{v}_{XY} ::\\\\to -\\\\sin{\\\\left(\\\\theta\\\\right)} v_{X} \\\\+ \\\\cos{\\\\left(\\\\theta\\\\right)} v_{Y}. So, v_{D} is the projection of \\\\vec{v}_{XY} onto the \\\\hat{u}_{D} axis, and v_{Q} is the projection of \\\\vec{v}_{XY} onto the \\\\hat{u}_{Q} axis. These new vector components, v_{D} and v_{Q}, together compose the new vector \\\\vec{v}_{DQ}, the original vector \\\\vec{v}_{XY} in terms of the new DQ reference frame. Projection of \\\\vec{v}_{XY} onto the DQ reference frame. Notice that the positive angle \\\\theta above caused the arbitrary vector to rotate backwards when transitioned to the new DQ reference frame. In other words, its angle with respect to the new reference frame is less than its angle to the old reference frame. This is because the reference frame, not the vector, was rotated forwards. Actually, a forwards rotation of the reference frame is identical to a negative rotation of the vector. If the old reference frame were rotating forwards, such as in three phase electrical systems, then the resulting DQ vector remains stationary. The operation above can be summarized by a single matrix equation: :\\\\vec{v}_{DQ} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\cos{\\\\left(\\\\theta\\\\right)} & \\\\sin{\\\\left(\\\\theta\\\\right)} \\\\\\\\\\\\ -\\\\sin{\\\\left(\\\\theta\\\\right)} & \\\\cos{\\\\left(\\\\theta\\\\right)} \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\cdot \\\\vec{v}_{XY}. This tensor can be expanded to three-dimensional problems, where the axis about which rotation occurs is left unaffected. In the following example, the rotation is about the Z axis, but any axis could have been chosen: :K_{P} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\cos{\\\\left(\\\\theta\\\\right)} & \\\\sin{\\\\left(\\\\theta\\\\right)} & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ -\\\\sin{\\\\left(\\\\theta\\\\right)} & \\\\cos{\\\\left(\\\\theta\\\\right)} & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\end{bmatrix}. From a linear algebra perspective, this is simply a clockwise rotation about the z-axis. ===The Clarke transform derivation=== The ABC unit basis vectors Consider a three-dimensional space with unit basis vectors A, B, and C. The sphere in the figure below is used to show the scale of the reference frame for context and the box is used to provide a rotational context. ABC unit basis vectors. Typically, in electrical engineering (or any other context that uses three-phase systems), the three-phase components are shown in a two- dimensional perspective. However, given the three phases can change independently, they are by definition orthogonal to each other. This implies a three-dimensional perspective, as shown in the figure above. So, the two- dimensional perspective is really showing the projection of the three- dimensional reality onto a plane. Two-dimensional perspective of a three- dimensional reality. Three-phase problems are typically described as operating within this plane. In reality, the problem is likely a balanced-phase problem (i.e., vA \\\\+ vB \\\\+ vC = 0) and the net vector :\\\\vec{v} = v_{A}\\\\hat{u}_{A} + v_{B}\\\\hat{u}_{B} + v_{C}\\\\hat{u}_{C} is always on this plane. The AYC' unit basis vectors To build the Clarke transform, we actually use the Park transform in two steps. Our goal is to rotate the C axis into the corner of the box. This way the rotated C axis will be orthogonal to the plane of the two-dimensional perspective mentioned above. The first step towards building the Clarke transform requires rotating the ABC reference frame about the A axis. So, this time, the 1 will be in the first element of the Park transform: :K_{1} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\cos{\\\\left(-\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{4}\\\\right)} & \\\\sin{\\\\left(-\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{4}\\\\right)} \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & -\\\\sin{\\\\left(-\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{4}\\\\right)} & \\\\cos{\\\\left(-\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{4}\\\\right)} \\\\end{bmatrix} ::\\\\to \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}} & -\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}} \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}} & \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}} \\\\end{bmatrix} The following figure shows how the ABC reference frame is rotated to the AYC' reference frame when any vector is pre- multiplied by the K1 matrix. The C' and Y axes now point to the midpoints of the edges of the box, but the magnitude of the reference frame has not changed (i.e., the sphere did not grow or shrink).This is due to the fact that the norm of the K1 tensor is 1: K1 = 1. This means that any vector in the ABC reference frame will continue to have the same magnitude when rotated into the AYC' reference frame. AYC' unit basis vectors. The C' and Y axes now point to the edges of the box, but the magnitude has not changed. The XYZ unit basis vectors Next, the following tensor rotates the vector about the new Y axis in a counter-clockwise direction with respect to the Y axis (The angle was chosen so that the C' axis would be pointed towards the corner of the box.): :K_{2} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\cos{\\\\left(\\\\theta\\\\right)} & 0 & -\\\\sin{\\\\left(\\\\theta\\\\right)} \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sin{\\\\left(\\\\theta\\\\right)} & 0 & \\\\cos{\\\\left(\\\\theta\\\\right)} \\\\end{bmatrix} : \\\\theta = \\\\cos^{-1}\\\\left(\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2}{3}}\\\\right) \\\\to 35.26^\\\\circ, or :K_{2} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2}{3}} & 0 & -\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{3}} \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{3}} & 0 & \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2}{3}} \\\\end{bmatrix}. Notice that the distance from the center of the sphere to the midpoint of the edge of the box is but from the center of the sphere to the corner of the box is . That is where the 35.26° angle came from. The angle can be calculated using the dot product. Let \\\\vec{m}=\\\\left(0,\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{2}}{2},\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\\\right) be the unit vector in the direction of C' and let \\\\vec{n} = \\\\left( \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{3}}, \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{3}}, \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{3}} \\\\right) be a unit vector in the direction of the corner of the box at \\\\vec{n} = \\\\left( 1, 1, 1 \\\\right) . Because \\\\vec{m} \\\\cdot \\\\vec{n} = \\\\vec{m} \\\\vec{n} \\\\cos \\\\theta, where \\\\theta is the angle between \\\\vec{m} and \\\\vec{n}, we have : \\\\left(0,\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{2}}{2},\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\\\right) \\\\cdot \\\\left( \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{3}}, \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{3}}, \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{3}} \\\\right) = \\\\cos \\\\theta : \\\\cos \\\\theta = 0 + \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{2}}{2\\\\sqrt{3}} + \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{2}}{2\\\\sqrt{3}} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2}{3}} :\\\\theta = \\\\cos^{-1} \\\\left( \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2}{3}} \\\\right) :\\\\theta = 35.26^\\\\circ. The norm of the K2 matrix is also 1, so it too does not change the magnitude of any vector pre-multiplied by the K2 matrix. XYZ unit basis vectors. The Z axis (rotated C' axis) now points into the corner of the box. The zero plane At this point, the Z axis is now orthogonal to the plane in which any ABC vector without a common- mode component can be found. Any balanced ABC vector waveform (a vector without a common mode) will travel about this plane. This plane will be called the zero plane and is shown below by the hexagonal outline. Plane of the vectors without common mode indicated by the hexagonal outline. The Z axis is orthogonal to this plane, and the X axis is parallel to the projection of the A axis onto the zero plane. The X and Y basis vectors are on the zero plane. Notice that the X axis is parallel to the projection of the A axis onto the zero plane. The X axis is slightly larger than the projection of the A axis onto the zero plane. It is larger by a factor of . The arbitrary vector did not change magnitude through this conversion from the ABC reference frame to the XYZ reference frame (i.e., the sphere did not change size). This is true for the power-invariant form of the Clarke transform. The following figure shows the common two-dimensional perspective of the ABC and XYZ reference frames. Two-dimensional perspective of the ABC and XYZ reference frames. It might seem odd that though the magnitude of the vector did not change, the magnitude of its components did (i.e., the X and Y components are longer than the A, B, and C components). Perhaps this can be intuitively understood by considering that for a vector without common mode, what took three values (A, B, and C components) to express, now only takes 2 (X and Y components) since the Z component is zero. Therefore, the X and Y component values must be larger to compensate. Combination of tensors The power-invariant Clarke transformation matrix is a combination of the K1 and K2 tensors: :K_{C} = \\\\underbrace{\\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2}{3}} & 0 & -\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{3}} \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{3}} & 0 & \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2}{3}} \\\\end{bmatrix}}_{K_2}\\\\cdot\\\\underbrace{\\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}} & -\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}} \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}} & \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}} \\\\end{bmatrix}}_{K_1}, or :K_{C} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2}{3}}\\\\cdot\\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & -\\\\frac{1}{2} & -\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{3}}{2} & -\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}} & \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}} & \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}} \\\\end{bmatrix} ::\\\\to \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\frac{2}{\\\\sqrt{6}} & -\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{6}} & -\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{6}} \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}} & -\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{3}} & \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{3}} & \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{3}} \\\\end{bmatrix}. Notice that when multiplied through, the bottom row of the KC matrix is 1/, not 1/3. (Edith Clarke did use 1/3 for the power-variant case.) The Z component is not exactly the average of the A, B, and C components. If only the bottom row elements were changed to be 1/3, then the sphere would be squashed along the Z axis. This means that the Z component would not have the same scaling as the X and Y components. KC frame (blue) and the original Edith matrix (green). As things are written above, the norm of the Clarke transformation matrix is still 1, which means that it only rotates an ABC vector but does not scale it. The same cannot be said for Clarke's original transform. It is easy to verify (by matrix multiplication) that the inverse of KC is : K^{-1}_C = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\frac{2}{\\\\sqrt{6}} & 0 & \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{3}}\\\\\\\\\\\\ -\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{6}} & \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}} & \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{3}} \\\\\\\\\\\\ -\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{6}} & -\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}} & \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{3}} \\\\end{bmatrix} Power-variant form It is sometimes desirable to scale the Clarke transformation matrix so that the X axis is the projection of the A axis onto the zero plane. To do this, we uniformly apply a scaling factor of and a to the zero component to get the power-variant Clarke transformation matrix: :K_{\\\\hat{C}} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2}{3}} \\\\cdot \\\\underbrace{\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2}{3}} \\\\cdot \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & -\\\\frac{1}{2} & -\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{3}}{2} & -\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{1}{2} & \\\\frac{1}{2} & \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\end{bmatrix}}_{K_C} ::\\\\to \\\\frac{2}{3} \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & -\\\\frac{1}{2} & -\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{3}}{2} & -\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{1}{2} & \\\\frac{1}{2} & \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\end{bmatrix} or :K_{\\\\hat{C}} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\frac{2}{3} & -\\\\frac{1}{3} & -\\\\frac{1}{3} \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{3}} & -\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{3}} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{1}{3} & \\\\frac{1}{3} & \\\\frac{1}{3} \\\\end{bmatrix}. This will necessarily shrink the sphere by a factor of as shown below. Notice that this new X axis is exactly the projection of the A axis onto the zero plane. The scaled XYZ reference frame of the power-variant Clarke transform. With the power-variant Clarke transform, the magnitude of the arbitrary vector is smaller in the XYZ reference frame than in the ABC reference frame (the norm of the transform is ), but the magnitudes of the individual vector components are the same (when there is no common mode). So, as an example, a signal defined by :\\\\begin{bmatrix} A \\\\\\\\\\\\ B \\\\\\\\\\\\ C \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\cos{\\\\left(\\\\omega t\\\\right)} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\cos{\\\\left(\\\\omega t - \\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{3}\\\\right)} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\cos{\\\\left(\\\\omega t + \\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{3}\\\\right)} \\\\end{bmatrix} becomes, in the XYZ reference frame, :\\\\begin{bmatrix} X \\\\\\\\\\\\ Y \\\\\\\\\\\\ Z \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\cos{\\\\left(\\\\omega t\\\\right)} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\cos{\\\\left(\\\\omega t - \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2}\\\\right)} \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 \\\\end{bmatrix}, a new vector whose components are the same magnitude as the original components: 1. In many cases, this is an advantageous quality of the power-variant Clarke transform. ===The DQZ transform=== The DQZ transformation uses the Clarke transform to convert ABC-referenced vectors into two differential-mode components (i.e., X and Y) and one common-mode component (i.e., Z) and then applies the Park transform to rotate the reference frame about the Z axis at some given angle. The X component becomes the D component, which is in direct alignment with the vector of rotation, and the Y component becomes the Q component, which is at a quadrature angle to the direct component. The DQZ transform is :K_{CP} = K_{P}\\\\cdot K_{C} ::\\\\to\\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\cos{\\\\left(\\\\theta\\\\right)} & \\\\sin{\\\\left(\\\\theta\\\\right)} & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ -\\\\sin{\\\\left(\\\\theta\\\\right)} & \\\\cos{\\\\left(\\\\theta\\\\right)} & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\cdot \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2}{3}} \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & \\\\frac{-1}{2} & \\\\frac{-1}{2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{3}}{2} & -\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}} & \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}} & \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}} \\\\end{bmatrix}. ==Code implementation== For computational efficiency, it makes sense to keep the Clarke and Park transforms separate and not combine them into one transform. A computationally-efficient implementation of the power-invariant Clarke transform is X = (2*A – B – C)*(1/sqrt(6)); Y = (B – C)*(1/sqrt(2)); Z = (A + B + C)*(1/sqrt(3)); while its inverse is A = (1/sqrt(3))*Z; B = A - (1/sqrt(6))*X; C = B – (1/sqrt(2))*Y; B += (1/sqrt(2))*Y; A += (sqrt(2/3))*X; A computationally-efficient implementation of the power-variant Clarke transform is X = (2*A – B – C)*(1/3); Y = (B – C)*(1/sqrt(3)); Z = (A + B + C)*(1/3); while its inverse is A = X + Z; B = Z – (1/2)*X; C = B – (sqrt(3)/2)*Y; B += (sqrt(3)/2)*Y; Evidently, the constant coefficients could be pre-calculated. A computationally-efficient implementation of the Park transform is co = cos(theta); si = sin(theta); D = co*X + si*Y; Q = co*Y - si*X; while its inverse is co = cos(theta); si = sin(theta); X = co*D - si*Q; Y = si*D + co*Q; It makes sense to only calculate \`co\` and \`si\` once if both the Park and inverse Park transforms are going to be used. ==Example== In electric systems, very often the A, B, and C values are oscillating in such a way that the net vector is spinning. In a balanced system, the vector is spinning about the Z axis. Very often, it is helpful to rotate the reference frame such that the majority of the changes in the abc values, due to this spinning, are canceled out and any finer variations become more obvious. The DQZ transformation can be thought of in geometric terms as the projection of the three separate sinusoidal phase quantities onto two axes rotating with the same angular velocity as the sinusoidal phase quantities. DQZ example. Shown above is the DQZ transform as applied to the stator of a synchronous machine. There are three windings separated by 120 physical degrees. The three phase currents are equal in magnitude and are separated from one another by 120 electrical degrees. The three phase currents lag their corresponding phase voltages by \\\\delta. The DQ axes are shown rotating with angular velocity equal to \\\\omega, the same angular velocity as the phase voltages and currents. The D axis makes an angle \\\\theta = \\\\omega t with the phase A winding which has been chosen as the reference. The currents I_D and I_Q are constant dc quantities. ==Comparison with other transformsPark's transformation=== The transformation originally proposed by Park differs slightly from the one given above. In Park's transformation q-axis is ahead of d-axis, qd0, and the \\\\theta angle is the angle between phase-a and q-axis, as given below: :P= \\\\frac{2}{3}\\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\cos(\\\\theta)&\\\\cos(\\\\theta - \\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{3})&\\\\cos(\\\\theta + \\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{3}) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sin(\\\\theta)& \\\\sin(\\\\theta - \\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{3})& \\\\sin(\\\\theta + \\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{3}) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{1}{2}&\\\\frac{1}{2}&\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\end{bmatrix} and :P^{-1} = \\\\begin{bmatrix}\\\\cos(\\\\theta)& \\\\sin(\\\\theta)&1\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\cos(\\\\theta - \\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{3})& \\\\sin(\\\\theta - \\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{3})&1\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\cos(\\\\theta + \\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{3})& \\\\sin(\\\\theta + \\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{3})&1\\\\end{bmatrix} D.

Whereas the dqo transform is the projection of the phase quantities onto a rotating two-axis reference frame, the αβγ transform can be thought of as the projection of the phase quantities onto a stationary two-axis reference frame. ==References== ; In-line references ; General references * C.J.

Chapter One. These community norms are delineated and put into practice by people who have earned the respect of those within each individual group, such as a community leader or elder. Although in Dharmaśāstra the ideal person who defines the ācāra of a particular place is dictated as one who knows the Vedas or is “learned”, in actual practice this role is often deferred to group leaders along with Vedic scholars.Davis, Jr. Donald R. Chapter Seven Ācāra is theologically important in Hindu law because it is considered, along with the Vedas (Śruti), and Smriti (traditional texts such as the Dharmaśāstra literature), to be one of the sources of dharma.Davis, Jr. Donald R. Chapter One Particular regional ācāra is believed to be canonized in Dharmaśāstra texts; however scholars differ on the source for the actual accounts found within these texts.Lariviere, Richard W. 1997. pp. 612. ==Ācāra as customary law== Customary law within the context of Hindu law is defined as akin to the community norm of a particular region. This form of law encompasses laws that are actually applied to daily life, as opposed to theological laws canonized in texts which are accessible for only a small proportion of the population. In this sense, customary law represents the actual practice of law in classical Hinduism, while laws found in the Vedas, , and śruti literature represent the theoretical practice.Lariviere, Richard W. 1997. pp. 623 Ācāra, however, is a particularly narrow scope of customary law. What separates it as a category is that these laws are put into practice by people who hold a particular power over that set group. The power is determined by a theological connection to the divine through a full understanding of Vedic literature. These people are also known in dharma literature as the sadācāra. Although dharmasastra identifies the sadācāra as the ideal person for creating laws because they are so fluent with Vedic knowledge that the laws they choose to enforce are in line with the Vedas, in reality, the power to develop laws shifted over time from Vedic scholars to community leaders whose actions gained the respect of their fellow community members and were distinguished as \\"good people\\" even if they lacked direct knowledge of the Vedas.Hacker, Paul. 2006. pp. 484 Eventually, even the laws penned by those not versed in the Vedas were connected back to Vedic literature. According to Mitramiśra, even the customs of Śudra are the dharma for Śudra. This means that each particular group has a different individual dharma they must fulfill. Therefore, as long as the practices of a leader are considered in line with the customs of the community, they are still considered to be pursuing their dharma and therefore are still connected to the Vedas.Lariviere, Richard W. 1997. pp. 618 ==Sadācāra == According to the Mimamsa scholar Kumārila, \\"when good people act according to certain rules and no motive or goal is apparent in the realm of the observable, then this is to be understood as dharma.\\" The \\"good people\\" of this definition represent the sadācāra. The \\"sad\\" of sadācāra is translated as good which causes sadācāra to translate as the \\"standards of the good (people)\\".Davis, Jr. Donald R. Chapter 7 Sadācāra within dharmasastra literature are people who orientate their actions toward the Veda and therefore their actions and decisions (ācāra) can be used as law. According to literature, sadācāra are the source of correct living, dharma, and therefore Hindu law, when laws set forth in the Vedas and Traditional texts do not address a particular issue. Several ancient commentators (including Kumārila) go so far as to put forth the claim that practices considered legitimate and recorded in the smṛtis but not found in the Vedas are actually located in a \\"lost Veda\\" available to the composers of the Dharma texts but now no longer extant.See Jonardon Ganeri's discussion of appeals to a \\"lost Veda\\" in \\"The ritual roots of moral reason: lessons from Mīmāṃsā\\", p. 213 ==Source of Dharma== Many texts within the Hindu Law tradition refer to ācāra as the third source of dharma.Hacker, Paul. pp. 2006. 485 Although knowledge about dharma received from the Vedas remains the primary source, the Vedas rarely mention dharma in a practical application for daily living. Because of this, there exist two other sources for dharma which provide more personally applicable directions for the follower's lives. If an answer to a question is not found within the Vedas themselves, the question is then posed to each level of sources until an answer is given. In descending rank in hierarchy, the sources of dharma are: #Vedas (śruti) #Traditional Texts () #Customary Law (ācāra) The power of ācāra within this hierarchy comes from its ability to connect with the Vedas. This connection comes either through the sadācāra, or leader, who establishes the ācāra because of his knowledge of the Vedas, or through citing an additional text as a source that is itself connected with the Vedas. ==Textual Accounts== There are a number of telling references to ācāra in Dharmaśāstra texts which reveal the real importance custom had for the settling of legal disputes. Nārada, for example, states that when something stated in a text on dharma conflicts with custom, custom wins out over the text.See Nārada Mātṛkā 1.34 Asahāya, in his commentary to this statement, confirms that the texts should never overturn lokācāra, or the \\"customs of the people.\\" Yājñavalkya 1.156 agrees that what is considered anathema by the people, even if proscribed by the smṛtis, is not to be enforced. Manu 8.41 likewise states that a judge must study the specific laws practiced by castes (jātidharma), particular regions (janapadharma), and families (kuladharma) before making any legal pronouncements relating to them. Even in rules concerning legal procedure itself, the importance of custom is evidenced. Nārada 1.115 states that the validity of documents, i.e. whether they must be witnessed, written in one's own handwriting, etc., should be determined based on local conventions. With regard to individual groups' own self-governance, Nārada 10.2-3 requires that the king allow heretical monastic groups (like Jains and Buddhists), guilds, local councils, and other corporate groups to exercise their own laws and customs. See also Bṛhaspati 2.29-31 According to Yājñavalkya 1.342-343, the king must preserve the customs and conventions of all newly conquered lands as well. Various scholars hold differing ideas about the origin of the recorded ācāra found in Dharmaśāstra literature such as the . Some, such as scholar Richard Lariviere, hold that traditional texts are \\"records of actual customs and practices found in classical India\\". These were factual records \\"recorded whether the compilers of agreed with them or not\\". Although each of the customs recorded within were drawn from various times and localities, the importance of recording and compiling them was to integrate the local practices into the larger brahminical sector by connecting them to the Vedas. A different origin for the textual accounts of ācāra stated by scholar Donald R. Davis Jr., claims the ācāra of the time was not directly recorded verbatim, but instead influenced the scholars who crafted literature. However, even without the direct approval or recording done by classically defined sadācāra, or Vedic scholars, the community norms of a particular location dictated by their own leaders, who may not be Vedic scholars, remained meaningful. This demonstrates a view in which a particular practice doesn't have to be directly tied to the Veda in order for it to be honored as ācāra. ==Role of Ācāra in Hindu Law== Various difficult questions arise in regard to the relative force of śruti, , and ācāra in Hindu law and numerous rules have been laid down in cases of apparent and real conflicts among them.Kane, P.V. pp. 863 \\"Ācāra (customs and usage) are transcendental law, and so are the practices declared in the Veda and the ; therefore a twice-born person desirous of his own welfare should always make effort to follow it.\\" 1.107 The meaning of ācāra itself has changed over time in Hindu law. In the earliest days, ācāra that was to be followed was that observed or declared by learned Brahmins who were highly moral and selfless. Gradually, however, usage that had no visible secular purpose came to be looked upon as binding. Eventually, even customary norms of Śudras became enforceable by the king. In this manner, ācāra became the actual source of Hindu law in more contemporary times. Commentaries on the śāstras indicate an attempt to reconcile the text law with the actual usages of the people.Kane, P.V. pp. 876 ==See also== *Common Law *Law of the land ==NotesReferences== * Davis, Jr. Donald R.

He was the first mayor of Cox's Bazar. ==Early life== Fazlul Karim was born in Harbang, a village in Cox's Bazar district in the province of Bengal, to Golam Quader Shikdar, a village leader and Feroza Begum on 14 September 1905. He was the elder son in a family of seven daughters and three sons. Fazlul was educated at the Harbang Union School and later moved to Government Muslim High School in Chittagong, from where he completed his matriculation. He had passed his Intermediate with science from Chittagong College and completed his B.A. and B.L. from Presidency College, Kolkata in 1923 and 1925 respectively. He started his practice as a lawyer in Calcutta Judges Court as junior lawyer of Barrister Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy, who used to appoint him to deal with his civil cases in the lower courts. He found his practice as a junior lawyer so lucrative that he refused to become a Munsif when he was offered a post by the Lieutenant Governor. After completion of his B.A exams he joined the Writers' Building (from 1923 to 1926) as the infamous Police Commissioner Sir Charles Augustus Tegart's Bengali translator; as he was fluent in both Urdu and Bengali, he had to translate news from vernacular newspapers for Sir Tegart and Colonel Simpson's perusal. Neither suspected that he was sympathetic to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose. Colonel Simpson was killed in a daring attack on Writers' Building by Bengali Militants. Karim was present in that particular room. The two militants did not harm him. But Sir Tegart managed to escape and mount an assault on the militants who tried to commit suicide. He was also accompanying Sir Charles Augustus Tegart when Gopinath Saha tried to assassinate him on January 12, 1924 at Chowringhee Road in Calcutta. Later he returned to Cox's Bazar completing his survey course from Savar, Dhaka and started his practice in Cox's Bazar Judges Court. He had much interest in historical legal cases. He observed the entire Bhawal Raja case staying at Dhaka. ==Career== Fazlul Karim in National Guard Uniform * Pakistan National Guards: Fazlul Karim was appointed in the then 22nd Battalion of Pakistan National Guards as Lieutenant under the command of Major General Ayub Khan and later promoted as Captain. He was the Officer In Charge (OC) of a platoon of 22nd National Guards, which was posted at Cox's Bazar. When the National Guard was converted into the Bangladesh Ansars (then East Pakistan Ansars), he left the job and joined in the political group, the Muslim League. * Chairman of Cox's Bazar Municipality: Advocate Fazlul Karim was elected chairman of Cox's Bazar in 1950 (first after independence from British Raj) from Muslim League and later in 1954 as an independent candidate. He had established the Tamarisk Forest along the beach to draw tourist in this town and also to protect the beach from storm surges. He also donated many of his father in law's and his own lands for establishing a Public Library and a Town Hall for the town. He was inspired to make Cox's Bazar to make a tourist spot after seeing beaches of Bombay and Karachi, and one of the pioneers in developing Cox's Bazar as such. He founded a Maternity Hospital, the Stadium and the drainage system by procuring grants from the Ford Foundation and Rockefeller Foundation through correspondence. Mr. T. H. Mathewman, the principal of the Dacca Engineering College (1951~1954) was his friend who had helped him in doing this. Engineer Chandi Charan Das was the government civil engineer who had worked on all these projects. * Chief Assessor, Chittagong Municipality: He then joined Chittagong Municipality as Chief Assessor for Taxes and developed the method and calculation for Municipal Taxes for the Municipalities of West and East Pakistan (still maintained in Bangladesh Municipalities). * Chief Estate Officer, Chittagong Port Authority: He was appointed as Chief Estate Officer of the Chittagong Port Authority in 1966 and was the pioneer in dividing the estates of Railway and Port Authority in East Pakistan. * Pleader Commissioner, Chittagong Judges Court: After retirement from the Port Authority he served as Pleader Commissioner in the Chittagong Judges Court till the last day of his life. He was famous for his honesty and fair decision for land division in the courts of East Pakistan and Bangladesh. == Personal life == He was the first Muslim Graduate in the Cox's Bazar district. At the age of thirty, Fazlul married Nazmunnisa Chowdhurani, elder daughter of Zamindar Akbar Ahmed Chowdhury and granddaughter of Kiwk Zamindar Fazal Karim Chowdhury of Manikpur, Chakaria, Cox's Bazar in 1935. She gave birth to their four sons — Murad B.Z. Karim (an accountant), Brigadier General Khaled A. Karim (Ex-Director Army Signals), Flying Officer Shaheed Waleed Ehsanul Karim, and Zaid N. Karim. He had suffered for sheltering the Bangladesh Mukti Bahini at his home during the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971. His wife used to supply flags for the Mukti Bahini. On 24 May 1986, Captain Advocate Fazlul Karim died at the age of 81 years in his Jamal Khan Road residence at Chittagong. He was buried at the family graveyard at Harbang, Chakaria. == References == * History of Cox's Bazar by Advocate Dulal Chowdhury, Printed 1987, Page 45, 47 and 75 * Coksho Bazarer Itihash by Prof Nur Ahmed, May 1988 * Smaraniyo Baraniyo (Chakaria-Pekua) by Anowar Hossain, Printed Sept 2003, Page 77 and 81 == External links == * Cox's Bazar * About Cox's Bazar Category:1905 births Category:1986 deaths Category:Mayors of Cox's Bazar Category:Presidency University, Kolkata alumni Category:University of Calcutta alumni Category:Chittagong College alumni ","title":"Fazlul Karim (lawyer)"},{"id":"20526708","text":"The Colin Roderick Award is presented annually by the Foundation for Australian Literary Studies at Queensland's James Cook University for \\"the best book published in Australia which deals with any aspect of Australian life\\".

As member of the \\"Good Government\\" movement, Leavitt crusaded against Tammany Hall municipal corruption, demanding in 1897 the indictment of United States Senator Thomas C. Platt on charges of extorting bribes from the New York Life Insurance Company in return for favors to the insurance giant.\\"Wants Mr. Platt Indicted\\", The New York Times, Oct. 29, 1897 \\"We have positive evidence, which as soon as New York has an honest District Attorney,\\" Leavitt told a crowd of 2,000 gathered at Long Acre Square on Broadway, \\"will be laid before him, and we then shall be able to obtain an indictment and send the arch-boss to the jail which yawns for him.\\"Despite many allegations of bribery against Senator Platt, including a $500 bounty offered for proof of Platt's bribe-taking by then-Mayor Col. William Lafayette Strong, the Senator was never indicted. ==Early life and career beginnings== John Brooks Leavitt was born September 30, 1849, at Cincinnati, Ohio, where his father John McDowell Leavitt was practicing law,Prominent and Progressive Americans, An Encyclopedia of Contemporaneous Biography, Vol. I, Mitchell C. Harrison (ed.), New York Tribune, 1902 and his wife Bethia (Brooks) Leavitt. Leavitt subsequently attended high school in Zanesville, Ohio, where his father acted as minister of an Episcopal church after leaving his law practice. In 1868 Leavitt graduated from Kenyon College, and four years later he graduated with a master's degree.Kenyon College awarded John Brooks Leavitt a doctorate of laws in 1896. Leavitt then enrolled at the Columbia University School of Law, where he graduated in 1871. Following his graduation from Columbia, Leavitt began clerking in a New York City law office, and shortly after hung out his shingle as sole practitioner.Later Leavitt went into business with Boudinot Keith, opening the practice of Leavitt & Keith. Leavitt's practice was meager, but gradually he found clients, usually cases he took when he felt a client had been shortchanged. An early client was a clergyman who was accused of . In a subsequent case tied to election fraud, Leavitt filed suit against the New York State Secretary of State, the state's Attorney General and other state officers for contempt of court. The state officers sued by Leavitt were heavily fined by the court for their offense.Prominent and Progressive Americans, page 202 From the beginning of his career, Leavitt was outspoken. Among his targets through the years were the telephone monopoly,The Arena, Vol. XXXI, P.E.N. Club Centre for Writers in Exile, B.O.

The old common-law saying that corporations have no souls is false. Corporations have souls. Governments have souls. Society has a soul.\\"John Brooks Leavitt, Legal Aspect: Rights of Property and Rights of Men, from Labor and Capital: A Discussion of the Relations of Employer and Employed, John P. Peters, G. P. Putnam's Sons, New York, 1902 In another of Leavitt's articles, he cut to the chase. In writing on the church (Leavitt's client was a high churchman accused of malfeasance), Leavitt addressed the temptation to follow conventional wisdom. In his essay The Attitude of the Church Towards Things Not Seen, the New York attorney noted that while church members believed miracles which happened two millennia ago, and which they had not seen, they were skeptical of current events they had seen. \\"Sheep follow the shepherd,\\" Leavitt wrote. \\"Many laymen echo their minister.\\" Tammany Hall, East 14th Street, New York City - headquarters of the Democratic party machine against which John Brooks Leavitt and other reformers railed ==Outspoken crusader== Leavitt rarely missed an opportunity to put across his message.

Whittaker, 1898 Nor did Leavitt always take up the most popular causes. In one of his polemics, entitled To What Extent Should Insane Persons Be Amenable to Criminal Law?, Leavitt examined the issue of mental illness and legal culpability. (At the time Leavitt served as the chairman of the committee on Criminal Procedure of New York State Bar Association. Afterwards, Leavitt chaired the Bar Association's Committee on Commitment and Discharge of the Criminal Insane.)To what Extent Should Insane Persons be Amenable to Criminal Law?, by John Brooks Leavitt, Administration of Justice in the United States, American Academy of Political and Social Science, Published by Ayer Publishing, 1974 Leavitt became a pioneer of New York State laws relating to the criminal culpability of those adjudged mentally ill.The Survey, Vol. XXIV, Survey Associates, Charity Organization Society of the City of New York, April-September 1910, New York In 1910, Leavitt spoke to the graduating class of 18 women at the Woman's Law Class of New York University. \\"I regret to say that many of the criminal lawyers of this city,\\" Leavitt told the newly minted attorneys, \\"do not reflect much credit on the profession, for far too often are they criminal in both senses of the word.\\" If the jury system were removed, Leavitt told the 18 women who were among the first of their sex to practice law in the city, \\"in twenty-five years you will have a corrupt judiciary.\\"The New York Times, March 25, 1910\\"I trust that I shall ever be found as ready to raise my voice against judicial encroachments as against those of politicians or other less influential citizens,\\" Leavitt wrote in a May 18, 1901, letter to The New York Times. Like many reformers,Although Leavitt counted himself among the forces of reform, among his good friends was Samuel Calvin Tate Dodd, longtime lawyer for John D. Rockefeller. On Dodd's death, Leavitt delivered a eulogy to Dodd before the New York Bar Association on January 14, 1908. Leavitt's eulogy was later reprinted as a volume entitled Memorial of Samuel C. T. Dodd. Leavitt rarely passed up an opportunity to convey his message, and he was a frequent contributor of letters to the editor of The New York Times and other New York City newspapers.Leavitt's letters to the editor of The New York Times date from December 1922, March 1922, August 1923, and other dates. The New York attorney was a contributor to the book Everyday Ethics, a collection of essays on professional ethics published by the Yale University Press in New Haven.The Yale Review, George Park Fisher, Yale Publishing Association, New Haven, Ct., 1911 Among the progressives of the era, even during the era of President Theodore Roosevelt, there was widespread skepticism that things would change for the better. In a letter to John Brooks Leavitt of January 26, 1900, for instance, E. L. Godkin told the New York attorney that barring extraordinary events, he was happily removing himself from public service in the face of the greed and corruption of elected officials. \\"At the time in question I was under the delusion,\\" Godkin wrote to the reformer Leavitt, \\"from which I have recovered, that deliverance might come for this City from our respectable classes.... Thank God I am out of it. Such a condition of things among the instructed classes needs at least a generation to be reformed.\\"The Gilded Age Letters of E. L. Godkin, Edwin Lawrence Godkin, William M. Armstrong, Published by SUNY Press, 1974 Leavitt held no political offices, and expressed gratitude that he felt compelled towards none.

In 1893 he was persuaded to run for Assemblyman on the 'Good Government' reform ticket, but failed to win election, which the crusading lawyer said came as a relief.Prominent and Progressive Americans, p. 202 Leavitt served on committees for reform of the Bar Association, where he proposed novel plans including reconstituting the United States Circuit Court of Appeals with a different composition of federal judges.The Albany Law Journal: A Weekly Record of the Law and the Lawyers, Vol. LVII, Albany Law Journal Company, Albany, N.Y., 1898 ==Later life and legacy== John Brooks Leavitt was a member of the University Club, the Social Reform Club, the New York City League of Reform, the National Civil Service Reform League, the Barnard Club, Onteora Club, the Bar Association of New York City, the New York State Bar Association, the American Bar Association and the reform-minded Civil Service League.

He completed his Senior Cambridge (GCE) from PAF Public School Sargodha (formerly PAF College Sargodha) in April 1961 (5th Entry, Sabre House) and joined the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) in August 1961. ==PAF career== He was commissioned in the PAF on 22 June 1963 in the 36th GD(P) Course with the service serial number of Pak-4362 and being the Wing Under Officer, was a candidate for the Sword of Honour at this time, but did not end up receiving it. In a vehement debate at the PAF Academy in Risalpur, Waleed passionately pushed the agenda of the Language Movement of 1952 which compelled the Government of Pakistan to establish Bengali as an official language on par with Urdu and English (the official and mainstream languages in West Pakistan). He was later nominated and became known as the captain of the basketball team at the academy. Flight Lt. Matiur Rahman (later recipient of the Bir Sreshtho in the Bangladesh Liberation War) and Air Vice Marshal Momtaz Uddin Ahmed were his classmates in both Sargodha and Risalpur. Waleed, Matiur Rahman and Momtaz Uddin Ahmed alongside fellow cadets at PAF Academy Risalpur. Waleed in front of his F-86 Sabre. ==Fighter pilot in the PAF== After his commission, Waleed was posted with the No. 2 Squadron at PAF Base Masroor in Karachi. After successfully completing Jet Conversion Training on T-33 jet trainers, he was designated for a Fighter Conversion Training Course with the North American F-86 Sabre (a relatively new aircraft being delivered by the United States to Pakistan since the late 1950s), following which he was posted with the No. 19 Squadron in Peshawar due to his strong performance. Waleed was famous among personnel in the PAF for the daring stunts he performed with his F-86 Sabre and took part in the Republic Day flybys in Rawalpindi on 23 March 1965 as a wingman alongside Air Marshal Asghar Khan (then Chief of Air Staff of the Pakistan Air Force) and Air Commodore Zafar Chaudhry in Lockheed F-104 Starfighters. ==Indo-Pakistani War of 1965== Waleed died when his aircraft (which was hit by anti-aircraft guns in the Rann of Kutch during a sortie by Indian forces early in the morning) had serious engine trouble and rapidly plunged into the Arabian Sea about 10–15 miles off the southern coast of Karachi on the night of 19 April 1965 as he was returning to Karachi from a reconnaissance mission over Gujarat, India. He had engaged the Indian Army in skirmishes throughout the Rann of Kutch by dropping smoke bombs during the daytime to screen infantry attacks. Neither his body nor his aircraft were recovered, but a part of the rudder from the Sabre was found about two months after and retrieved near the location where his aircraft crashed. He was a fighter pilot with the 17th Squadron (The Tigers) of the Pakistan Air Force when he died, and Air Marshal Azim Daudpota was his squadron leader at the time. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Cox's Bazar * Old Sargodhians Category:1944 births Category:1965 deaths Category:Pakistan Air Force officers Category:Pakistani aviators Category:Pakistani military personnel killed in action Category:Pilots of the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 Category:Pakistani people of Bengali descent Category:PAF College Sargodha alumni ","title":"Waleed Ehsanul Karim"},{"id":"20526880","text":"Dr. Mary Ann Coady Weinand (December 25, 1959 – September 26, 2007) was an American psychiatrist in Tucson, Arizona for 16 years from 1991 until 2007. She was best known as an effective psychiatrist and has become a local symbol for hope in the fight against breast cancer. In May 2008 her old psychiatric clinic was renamed in her honor as a tribute to her legacy and impact in the Southern Arizona treatment of Psychiatry. It was the first time such a building was named after an employee in Tucson. She became a local icon in Tucson in the fight against breast cancer, which claimed her own life. She was the first woman psychiatrist to have a building name after her honor as a result of her legacy. More than $10,000 has been donated to local charities in her memory. She was featured in the Life Stories section of the Arizona Daily Star on May 10, 2008 ==Early life and career== Mary Ann Coady was born on Christmas Day, 1959 in Homestead Air Force Base near Miami, Florida to Neil J. Coady and Dolores (née Breitenbach). She was raised in Wichita, Kansas and graduated from Kapaun Mt. Carmel High School in 1977. Her favorite activity as a teen was riding her horse. She graduated from the University of Kansas with a B.A. in Human Biology with Distinction in 1982. She had initially planned on studying to become a Nurse, but when she applied to nursing school her interviewers suggested that with her record she would be more suited for Medical School. She switched her path of study to pre-medicine soon after. In college, she was a member of the Phi Beta Kappa Honor Society. She went on to Medical School and completed medical school at the University of Kansas School of Medicine in 1986, and residency training in Adult Psychiatry in 1990. She was board certified in both Adult Psychiatry and Addiction Psychiatry. She practiced psychiatry in Tucson from 1991 until June 2007 when she abruptly left work at COPE Community Services due to her rapidly deteriorating health. ==Death== She died on September 26, 2007, aged 47, peacefully at her home, surrounded by her family, from breast cancer. She had been with COPE since May 2001. Her battle with breast cancer enabled her to write her own obituary a week before she died. It was published in the Arizona Daily Star. In addition to her husband, Dr. Martin Edward Weinand (born October 19, 1958) and their three children physical therapist Michael Alexander Weinand, Lauren Marie Weinand, and Jamie Weinand.

His most outstanding achievement was the discovery of cimetidine, a drug used to combat stomach ulcers, when he was working at Smith Kline and French.Ganellin, C. Robin. Drug Discovery Today, Feb 2004, Vol. 9 Issue 4, p158, 3p He has received many awards and much recognition for his scientific pursuits over the years. He now lives near London and is a professor at University College London. ==Early life== Born in East London on 1934 January 25, Charon Robin Ganellin knew from an early age that his calling was chemistry. During his studies at Harrow County School for Boys, he developed a strong aptitude for science and maths, but his performance in language and history was lacking. Although he enjoyed biology and natural history above his other subjects, he was influenced to pursue a career in chemistry. Because his father and his maternal uncle were chemists, he recognised that chemists could make a living. Uncertain if a career in biology was possible, he decided to become a chemist. He began his formal studies at Queen Mary College in London where he received his first degree, a bachelor of science in chemistry. He continued his studies at Queen Mary College, researching tropylium chemistry with Michael J.S. Dewar where he discovered how to isolate the tropylium cation from cyclooctatetraene. For this research, he was awarded his PhD in organic chemistry in 1958 at the age of twenty-four. ==Scientific Work== In 1958, shortly after his PhD studies at Queen Mary College, Ganellin joined Smith Kline and French Laboratories in the UK where he began research in medicinal chemistry. Two years after starting at SK&F;, he went to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where he performed his postdoctoral work with Arthur C. Cope. At MIT he devised the first direct optical resolution of a chiral olefin using platinum complex chemistry. After a year at MIT, he returned to the United Kingdom to resume his work at SK&F.; In 1966 he headed a landmark research team at SK&F;, collaborating with Sir James Black researching histamine H2-receptor antagonists. This research eventually led to the discovery of cimetidine, also known by its trademark name Tagamet which is currently produced by GlaxoSmith Kline. Cimetidine was a revolutionary drug at the time of its creation. Peptic ulcers, or stomach ulcers, used to be a very serious medical condition. Stomach ulcers were very difficult to treat and caused a great deal of pain. If left untreated, they could even be life-threatening. In some cases, surgery was required to remove the ulcer. Because of these factors, cimetidine was an incredibly popular drug after it was approved for prescription. Cimetidine first entered the market in the United Kingdom in 1976, and was received extremely well. Cimetidine quickly garnered over one billion dollars in annual sales, making it the first blockbuster drug, and it is currently listed by the World Health Organization as one of the most essential drugs. Ganellin's contribution to this research was integral to its success. His adeptness at physical organic chemistry enabled him to understand the individual H2-receptor antagonist drugs they developed. Initially, the team developed burimamide as a potential H2-receptor antagonist for medicinal use. However, it was soon realised that burimamide was not an appropriate oral medicine. They quickly identified a similar drug, metiamide, which appeared to have clinical potential. However, metiamide also had a shortcoming – its safety was uncertain. The end result of their trials was cimetidine, an H2-receptor antagonist superior to both burimamide and metiamide. The precursor drugs which marked the progress of their research are termed prototypes. These prototype drugs helped them understand the mechanisms that described how the drugs function. Ganellin's input was vital to the progression of their research along the sequence of prototypes to final product. Although Ganellin's contribution to the discovery of cimetidine was immeasurable, he was not alone. He collaborated with many other scientists at SmithKline and French, including fellow medicinal chemist Graham J. Durant. Durant was able to provide his expertise on guanidine chemistry to further the progress of the research. Sir James Whyte Black, a biologist from Scotland, was also instrumental in their research. He identified the role of the H2-receptor in the production of stomach acid. This discovery was crucial to their research, providing the impetus to search for a suitable H2-receptor antagonist to affect production of stomach acid. John C. Emmett, another medicinal chemist, is also credited as a co-discoverer of cimetidine. In addition to these key players, many others contributed to the research, such as William Duncan, the director of research at SK&F;, as well as Michael Parsons, whose pharmacological experience was greatly beneficial. ==Later life== Ganellin's collaborators influenced him and imparted in him knowledge and experience which has remained with him throughout the decades. Ganellin once said that the one achievement that gave him the \\"most professional pride\\" was his discovery of cimetidine. This period of his life has defined his scientific career, while also providing him with inspiration to continue his research in medicinal chemistry. Although Ganellin considers cimetidine his greatest achievement, he has never wavered in his devotion to scientific research. In 1981 he set up the syllabus for the Summer School in Medicinal Chemistry for the Royal Society of Chemistry that was still running in 2014. It was also copied by the American Chemical Society. After his work on cimetidine was complete, he was given the position of vice-president for research at SK&F;'s Welwyn facility. After his considerable tenure at SmithKline & French came to an end in 1986, Ganellin has continued to remain active in the affairs of medicinal chemistry. Shortly before leaving, he was awarded his D.Sc. from London University for his research and publications on histaminergic drugs and elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society (the UK's National Academy of Science). In 1986, he was appointed as the SmithKline & French Chair of Medicinal Chemistry at University College London where he began a lengthy career in academia. His research group tackled at least 10 different medicinal chemical projects and one of these came to fruition. He is co-inventor of pitolisant, the first histamine H3-receptor antagonist/inverse agonist Wakix, for treating narcolepsy. ==Awards and achievements== Since graduating, Robin Ganellin has authored or co-authored over 260 scientific papers and is listed as inventor or co-inventor on over 160 US patents. He has served as the president of the IUPAC medicinal chemistry section, and for 10 years (until 2012) he was the chair of the subcommittee on medicinal chemistry and drug development. He has won many awards and commendations over the years, both for his work on cimetidine and his research in other areas of medicinal chemistry. He has received awards in medicinal chemistry from many organisations, such as the Royal Society of Chemistry, the American Chemical Society, the Society of Chemical Industry, the Society for Drug Research, the European Federation for Medicinal Chemistry, the Société Chimie Thérapeutique of France, and the Medicinal Chemistry Division of the Italian Chemical Society. He was also inducted into the US National Inventors Hall of Fame in 1990 for his work on cimetidine. Ganellin currently serves as the Emeritus Professor of Medicinal Chemistry, although he is now partially retired. ==References== * Ganellin, C. Robin. J. Chem.

It is usually shy and retiring and is often confused with the Sydney funnel-web spider, which is one of the most venomous spiders in the world. ==Description== Sydney brown trapdoors are medium-to-large in size; the female is around 35 mm in length, while the male is usually around 20 mm and of a slimmer build. They are chocolate brown coloured and the males have distinct boxing glove-shaped palps, which are the appendages at the front of the head between the first pair of legs. Image:Male Sydney brown trapdoor spider.jpgMale Image:Female Sydney brown trapdoor spider.jpgFemale ==Behavior== Sydney brown trapdoors are usually shy and retiring, although the occasional individual will stand up and show its fangs if harassed inside its burrow. They spend most of the time in their burrows. At night, they are waiting for food in front of their burrows. Mature male Sydney brown trapdoors wander during humid weather in search of a mate. Mating takes place within the female's burrow. Usually the male escapes being eaten in order to mate with several females, before dying. The eggs are kept in the mother's burrow in a cocoon. After hatching, the spiderlings stay in the burrow for some time and eventually emerge to disperse and fend for themselves. ==Habitat== Sydney brown trapdoors dig an open burrow in the ground that is lined with silk. These burrows may reach 250 mm in depth and around 25 mm in width. Brown trapdoors with silk triplines around them are often found at the entrances to the burrows. ==Toxicity== Often mistaken for funnel-webs, the bites of Sydney brown trapdoors are not dangerous. Local pain and swelling may occur. ==References== * , Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) * , Wildlife of Sydney * , Encyclopedia of Life * , The Journal of Arachnology * , American Arachnology (pdf-document) * , The World Spider Catalog Version 9 by Norman I.

They are endemic to Brazil, occurring in large river channels in the Amazon River basin. Both species are unusual benthic predators that specialize in biting off the tails of other knifefishes, and are characterized by their greatly enlarged jaws and teeth. Recent systematic studies indicate that both species should be included in Sternarchella instead of being placed in their own genus. ==Taxonomy and etymology== The name Magosternarchus honors Dr. Francisco Mago Leccia, who has made many contributions to the study of gymnotiform knifefishes; the latter part of the name sternarchus is from the Greek sternon (\\"chest\\") and archos (\\"rectum\\"), referring to the forward placement of the urogenital opening in this group of fishes. The species name of M. raptor is from the Latin for \\"plunderer\\", referring to its tail-eating habits; the species name of M. duccis refers to the Duke University Center for Creative Ichthyology (DUCCIS), an ichthyology club. Based on several shared skeletal traits, the closest relative of Magnosternarchus is believed to be the genus Sternarchella. Several studies using both morphological and genetic data, published in 2013 and later, have strongly suggested that the genus should be merged into Sternarchella (making Magosternarchus a junior synonym) and this has been followed by the Catalog of Fishes. Nevertheless, FishBase continues to recognize the two genera as separate. ==Distribution and habitat== Both species of Magnosternarchus are believed to range widely in the Amazon basin, including in the Rio Negro to at least above the confluence of the Branco River. M. raptor has been collected as far upstream as the lower Jutai River and as far downstream to the lower Xingu River; M. ducci has been collected as far upstream as Ica River and as far downstream as Trombetas River. They are found in large, swift-flowing whitewater and blackwater river channels, at least from shore, at depths of . They are absent from beaches, small streams, and other marginal habitats. ==Description== Magosternarchus species are immediately recognizable by their large jaws, allowing for a wide gape, and their numerous, large, conical teeth. Both the premaxilla and the dentary bone are elongated, the former bearing two to three rows of teeth (numbering 9-14 in the outermost row) and the latter bearing three rows of teeth (numbering 15-19 in the outermost row). The deeply concave dorsal margin of the opercle also serves to distinguish this genus. The eyes are small and placed towards the top of the head. The body is similar to other ghost knifefishes, being laterally compressed with a long anal fin, a small caudal fin, and no dorsal or pelvic fins. There is a dorsal filament originating posterior to the midpoint of the body. The coloration is pinkish-white to translucent, with varying numbers of grayish-brown to black chromatophores on the upper sides of the body. The chromatophores are most concentrated at the dorsal midline, with the dorsal filament usually the darkest, and there are also thin, vertical lines of chromatophores on the connective tissue between the anal fin radial muscles. The pigmentation on the nape is interrupted by a pair of pale, comma- shaped lateralis tubes. Tiny light dots of electrosensory cell clusters are present over the back. The anal fin is clear, the caudal fin is clear to dusky, and the anal fin is clear in front and darkly pigmented along the base in the back. ==Biology and ecology== The only identifiable stomach contents of Magnosternarchus specimens have been the tails of other gymnotiform knifefishes. Most of the Magnosternarchus specimens thus far examined have also possessed regenerated tails. Like other apteronid knifefishes, Magnosternarchus is capable of producing a continuous weak electrical discharge for electrolocation and electrocommunication. ==Species== FishBase recognizes two species in this genus, while both are placed in Sternarchella by Catalog of Fishes. *Magnosternarchus duccis Lundberg, Cox Fernandes & Albert, 1996 This species differs from M. raptor in having a markedly projecting lower jaw that often extends past and over the upper jaw and snout. The head is elongated and deep, with a concave dorsal profile. There are 204-212 fin rays in the anal fin, 14-16 rays in the pectoral fins, and 15 rays in a pointed caudal fin. The maximum reported length is . *Magnosternarchus raptor Lundberg, Cox Fernandes & Albert, 1996 This species has an elongated, deep head with a moderately elongated, conical snout. The jaws are of equal length or the upper jaw is slightly longer. There are 180-197 fin rays in the anal fin, 14-16 rays in the pectoral fins, and 17 rays in a rounded caudal fin. The maximum reported length is . ==References== Category:Apteronotidae Category:Fish of South America Category:Fish of Brazil Category:Freshwater fish genera Category:Taxa named by James S.

His best known work, a woodcut rendering of a clenched-fist salute, was a model for the New Left emblem. Cieciroka (che- CHOR-ka) grew up in Johnson City upstate New York. In 1957, he attended San Jose State College in California,Heller, Steven, Frank Cieciorka, Designer for the Left, Is Dead at 69, The New York Times, November 27, 2008, accessed June 28, 2013 where he joined the Socialist Party out of opposition to American military intervention in the Dominican Republic and Vietnam. In 1964, he was a volunteer organizer during the Freedom Summer drive to register black voters in Mississippi and served as field secretary for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, experiences which shaped his political consciousness.Legendary Artist of the New Left : Frank Cieciorka Dead at 69, November 26, 2008, accessed June 28, 2013 Cieciroka also helped organize the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, an alternative to the official white- dominated state Democratic Party. Examples of the fist in political art can be found as far back in 1917, on an Industrial Workers of the World poster, but Cieciroka pioneered its modern usage.Cushing, Lincoln, A brief history of the \\"clenched fist\\" image, Docs Populi, 2006, accessed June 28, 2013 Having seen the clenched-fist salute at a Socialist rally in San Francisco, he decided it was a natural image for a woodcut. It gained widespread popularity when Cieciroka and others put the design on a button and gave out thousands at political rallies and demonstrations. In particular, the fist for the 1967 Stop the Draft Week became what art archivist and historian Lincoln Cushing considered \\"the iconic New Left fist — very stylized and easy to reproduce, picked up almost immediately by Students for a Democratic Society and others.\\" Although the Black Panther Party used as its primary logo a panther designed by Emory Douglas, versions of Mr. Cieciorka's \\"power salute\\" also were featured in its publications. Cieciroka's other work includes the book \\"Negroes in American History: A Freedom Primer,\\" which he wrote and illustrated with Bobbi Dearborn Cieciorka who also graduated from San Jose State.Roberts, Gene, New Primer tells history of Negro: Rights group publishes book for freedom schools, The New York Times, August 15, 1965, Page 69, accessed June 28, 2013SNCC puts out history primer, Washington Afro-American, September 7, 1965, accessed June 28, 2013Bobbi Cieciorka (text), Frank Cieciorka (text & drawings), Negroes in American history, Atlanta : The Student Voice, 1965, , 51 pages The book was used in \\"freedom schools\\" throughout the American South during the fight for civil rights. Its cover shows four hands and one fist reaching for the sky and is possibly the first use of the fist in the civil rights movement. He drew poster art for labor groups including the United Farm Workers and other labor groups, made contributions to the Peoples Press Cooperative and was art director for The Movement newspaper.

The Pheu Thai Party was founded on 20 September 2008, as an anticipated replacement for the People's Power Party (PPP), which the Constitutional Court of Thailand dissolved less than three months later after finding party members guilty of electoral fraud. The People's Power Party was a replacement for Thaksin's original Thai Rak Thai Party (TRT) which the Constitutional Court dissolved in May 2007 for violation of electoral laws. , Pheu Thai had 22,771 members. ==Formation and opposition years (2008-2011)== The PPP was dissolved by the Constitutional Court of Thailand on 2 December 2008. On 3 December 2008, the majority of the former PPP MPs defected to the Pheu Thai Party. In a PTP general assembly, the first executive commission was elected on 7 December 2008. Candidates for the party's leader were: Yongyuth Wichaidit, Apiwan Wiriyachai, former Vice President of the House of Representatives, former health minister Chalerm Yubamrung and former industry minister Mingkwan Saengsuwan. Yongyuth Wichaidit was elected as the party's leader. In a December 2008 parliamentary session, MPs of five PPP coalition parties decided to endorse Abhisit Vejjajiva as the next prime minister and themselves forming a Democrat-led coalition. The PTP campaigned for their endorsement by the PPP- coalition parties. However, Abhisit had gained their support for the premiership. After that, the party called for a national unity government in which all parties would be involved, with Sanoh Thienthong of the Pracharaj Party as the new premier. This proposal was rejected by the defecting coalition parties and the Democrat Party. On 11 December, Worrawat Eua- apinyakul, then MP for Phrae from PTP, suggested that the party should push for a house dissolution and general elections, with the hope of depriving the prospective coalition of a parliamentary majority. However, The President of the House of Representatives; Chai Chidchob spoke against the plan. On 15 December 2008, the party elected Pracha Promnok as the party's candidate for prime minister and has since been in opposition to prime minister Abhisit Vejjajiva's coalition government. As an opposition, the party received a rating of 3.75 out of 10 by a majority of respondents in a nationwide survey conducted on 24 and 25 December 2010, by Bangkok University. In early May 2011, Charupong Ruangsuwan was named new Secretary general of the party. Following the discovery of illegal timber by Thai authorities, during an August 2014 search at Charupong's son's Mae Hong Son Province resort for buried war weapons and other illegal items, the media reported that both Charupong and his son were no longer present in Thailand. ==In government (2011-2014)== In the 2011 general election, the Pheu Thai Party contested for the first time since its foundation. On 16 May, Thaksin's youngest sister Yingluck Shinawatra was nominated head of PTP's party-list proportional representation and contender of prime minister Abhisit. One of her main issues in the campaign was national reconciliation. The election was expected to be a neck-and-neck contest between Pheu Thai and the ruling Democrats. Unexpectedly, the party won 265 of 500 seats in the House of Representatives on 3 July. Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva acknowledged Pheu Thai's success in the election, and congratulated Yingluck Shinawatra as Thailand's first female prime minister. Despite its absolute majority, the winning party announced that it would form a coalition government with five minor parties. On 5 August, Yingluck was elected prime minister with 296 votes in favour.

AD Model Builder: using automatic differentiation for statistical inference of highly parameterized complex nonlinear models. Optim. Methods Softw. 27:233-249 It was created by David Fournier and now being developed by the ADMB Project, a creation of the non-profit ADMB Foundation. The \\"AD\\" in AD Model Builder refers to the automatic differentiation capabilities that come from the AUTODIF Library, a C++ language extension also created by David Fournier, which implements reverse mode automatic differentiation. A related software package, ADMB-RE, provides additional support for modeling random effects. ==Features and use== Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are integrated into the ADMB software, making it useful for Bayesian modeling. In addition to Bayesian hierarchical models, ADMB provides support for modeling random effects in a frequentist framework using Laplace approximation and importance sampling. ADMB is widely used by scientists in academic institutions, government agencies, and international commissions, most commonly for ecological modeling. In particular, many fisheries stock assessment models have been built using this software. ADMB is freely available under the New BSD License, with versions available for Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, and OpenSolaris operating systems. Source code for ADMB was made publicly available in March 2009. == History and background  Implementation === Work by David Fournier in the 1970s on development of highly parameterized integrated statistical models in fisheries motivated the development of the AUTODIF Library, and ultimately ADMB. The likelihood equations in these models are typically non-linear and estimates of the parameters are obtained by numerical methods. Early in Fournier's work, it became clear that general numerical solutions to these likelihood problems could only be reliably achieved using function minimization algorithms that incorporate accurate information about the gradients of the likelihood surface. Computing the gradients (i.e. partial derivatives of the likelihood with respect to all model variables) must also be done with the same accuracy as the likelihood computation itself. Fournier developed a protocol for writing code to compute the required derivatives based on the chain rule of differential calculus. This protocol is very similar to the suite of methods that came to be known as \`\`reverse mode automatic differentiation .A. Griewank and G. F.Corliss (eds). Automatic differentiation of algorithms: theory, implementation, and application.\` Society of Industrial and Applied Mathematics. 1992. The statistical models using these methods D. Fournier and I.

Model developers are usually only interested in the first of these constituents. Any programming tools that can reduce the overhead of developing and maintaining the other seven will greatly increase their productivity. Bjarne Stroustrup began development of C++ in the 1970s at Bell Labs as an enhancement to the C programming language. C++ spread widely, and by 1989, C++ compilers were available for personal computers. The polymorphism of C++ makes it possible to envisage a programming system in which all mathematical operators and functions can be overloaded to automatically compute the derivative contributions of every differentiable numerical operation in any computer program. === Otter Research === Fournier formed Otter Research Ltd. in 1989, and by 1990 the AUTODIF Library included special classes for derivative computation and the requisite overloaded functions for all C++ operators and all functions in the standard C++ math library. The AUTODIF Library automatically computes the derivatives of the objective function with the same accuracy as the objective function itself and thereby frees the developer from the onerous task of writing and maintaining derivative code for statistical models. Equally important from the standpoint of model development, the AUTODIF Library includes a \\"gradient stack\\", a quasi-Newton function minimizer, a derivative checker, and container classes for vectors and matrices. The first application of the AUTODIF Library was published in 1992 K. N. Holland, R. Brill, R. Chang, J. Sibert, and D. Fournier. Physiological and behavioural thermogregulation in bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus). Nature, 358:410--412, 1992. The AUTODIF Library does not, however, completely liberate the developer from writing all of the model constituents listed above. In 1993, Fournier further abstracted the writing of statistical models by creating ADMB, a special \\"template\\" language to simplify model specification by creating the tools to transform models written using the templates into the AUTODIF Library applications. ADMB produces code to manage the exchange of model parameters between the model and the function minimizer, automatically computes the Hessian matrix and inverts it to provide an estimate the covariance of the estimated parameters. ADMB thus completes the liberation of the model developer from all of the tedious overhead of managing non-linear optimization, thereby freeing him or her to focus on the more interesting aspects of the statistical model. By the mid-1990s, ADMB had earned acceptance by researchers working on all aspects of resource management. Population models based on the ADMB are used to monitor a range of both endangered species and commercially valuable fish populations including whales, dolphins, sea lions, penguins, albatross, abalone, lobsters, tunas, marlins, sharks, rays, anchovy, and pollock. ADMB has also been used to reconstruct movements of many species of animals tracked with electronic tags. In 2002, Fournier teamed up with Hans Skaug to introduce random effects into ADMB. This development included automatic computation of second and third derivatives and the use of forward mode automatic differentiation followed by two sweeps of reverse model AD in certain cases. === ADMB Project === In 2007, a group of ADMB users that included John Sibert, Mark Maunder and Anders Nielsen became concerned about ADMB's long-term development and maintenance. An agreement was reached with Otter Research to sell the copyright to ADMB for the purpose of making ADMB an open-source project and distributing it without charge. The non-profit ADMB Foundation was created to coordinate development and promote use of ADMB. The ADMB Foundation drafted a proposal to the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation for the funds to purchase ADMB from Otter Research. The Moore Foundation provided a grant to the National Center of Ecological Analysis and Synthesis at the University of California at Santa Barbara in late 2007 so that the Regents of the University of California could purchase the rights to ADMB. The purchase was completed in mid-2008, and the complete ADMB libraries were posted on the ADMB Project website in December 2008. By May 2009, more than 3000 downloads of the libraries had occurred. The source code was made available in December 2009. In mid-2010, ADMB was supported on all common operating systems (Windows, Linux, MacOS and Sun/SPARC), for all common C++ compilers (GCC, Visual Studio, Borland), and for both 32 and 64 bit architectures. ADMB Foundation efforts during the first two years of the ADMB Project have focused on automating the building of ADMB for different platforms, streamlining installation, and creation of a user-friendly working environments. Planned technical developments include parallelization of internal computations, implementation of hybrid MCMC, and improvement of the large sparse matrix for use in random effects models. == See also == * List of statistical packages * List of numerical analysis software * Comparison of numerical analysis software ==ReferencesExternal links== * For downloads of installers, manuals and source code: The ADMB Project * To support the ADMB Project: The ADMB Foundation * Original developer of ADMB: Otter Research Ltd Category:Array programming languages Category:Cross-platform free software Category:Free statistical software Category:Numerical analysis software for Linux Category:Numerical programming languages Category:Statistical programming languages ","title":"ADMB"},{"id":"20527178","text":"The electoral district of Brighton was a single-member electoral district of the Tasmanian House of Assembly. It extended from the town of Brighton to the north of Hobart. The seat was created ahead of the Assembly's first election held in 1856, and was abolished at the 1903 election, when it was merged with neighbouring Richmond into the new district of Monmouth. The election on 22 May 1891 resulted in the defeat of the incumbent member, Henry Mugliston, by Thomas Dillon. Mugliston petitioned the court alleging Dillon had engaged in corrupt practices and bribery during the campaign and on 25 July 1891, Dillon's election was declared void under the Electoral Act 1890. Neither candidate ran in the resulting by-election on 12 August 1891, and Henry Dobson, who was aligned with Mugliston, won against non-aligned candidate Thomas Hodgman. Barely a year later, following the fall of Philip Fysh's government, Dobson became Premier of Tasmania, a role in which he served for 20 months. ==Members for Brighton== {  - !Member!!Term -  Henry Butler  1856–1862 -  John Hayes  1862–1866 -  Henry Butler  1866–1885 -  Alfred Lord  1885–1886 -  Henry Mugliston  1886–1891 -  Thomas Dillon  1891–1891 -  Henry Dobson  1891–1900 -  Thomas Hodgman  1900–1903 } ==References== * * * Parliament of Tasmania (2006).

The school was named in honor of Kelly Miller, an African American mathematician, sociologist, essayist, newspaper columnist, author, and an important figure in the intellectual life of black America for close to half a century. At the time, Miller was Howard University Dean of the college of Arts and Sciences, and traveled to Clarksburg to discuss education as a way to help African Americans. The black community of Clarksburg decided to change the name of the school that same year, 1920, from Water Street 'colored' School to Kelly Miller 'colored' School. The school colors were black and orange, and the team was the Kelly Miller Yellow Jackets. The school's building has been the location of the central offices for the Harrison County Board of Education since 1982. The future of this building is in limbo as the board offices are planning to move to the former Gore Middle School which is a newer recently closed structure. ==Location== Kelly Miller High School is located on EB Saunders Way, in Clarksburg, West Virginia. It is still standing today and serves as the main office for the Harrison County School Board. The builder, Charles D. Ogden, was a Harrison County resident. He completed the building in 1902. Like many black schools throughout the state, Kelly Miller existed not just for the students. Prior to integration, the school was a focal point of the Clarksburg black community. It served as a rallying point, a social center and an institution with which the black community could identify. In 1929 the building was expanded to include a gymnasium, swimming pool, large library, more classrooms manual arts workshop, an auditorium with a seating capacity of 825 and a first-class home economics department. ==Kelly Miller== Kelly Miller Miller was born in Winnsboro, South Carolina in 1863, and graduated from Howard University in 1886. He was the first black admitted to Johns Hopkins University when he began his graduate studies in mathematics, physics, and astronomy. Appointed professor of mathematics at Howard in 1890, Miller introduced sociology into the curriculum in 1895, serving as professor of sociology from 1895 to 1934. As dean of the College of Arts and Sciences, he modernized the classical curriculum, strengthening the natural and social sciences. Miller graduated from Howard's School of Law in 1903. Miller was a prolific writer of articles and essays which were published in major newspapers and magazines and several books including Out of the House of Bondage. Miller assisted W. E. B. Du Bois in editing The Crisis, the official journal of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). In the 1920s and 1930s, his weekly column appeared in more than 100 newspapers. On African American educational policy, Miller aligned himself with neither the \\"radicals\\" -- Du Bois and the Niagara Movement -- nor the \\"conservatives\\" -- the followers of Booker T. Washington. Miller sought a middle way, a comprehensive education system that would provide for \\"symmetrical development\\" of African American citizens by offering both vocational and intellectual instruction. Miller was a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. ==Notable staff== Duncan Huey Kyle Duncan Huey Kyle Was the principal when the school opened he was a well known African American. Around this period the state of Alabama trained and sent out to adjacent states a number of African American men and women to places among the leaders of the race in the educational, religious, and business life. Kyle was among these. His start date at Kelly Miller is unknown but he left Kelly Miller in 1919.http://www.wvculture.org/HISTORY/histamne/kyle.html West Virginia Division of Culture and History EB Saunders served as the school's principal from 1919 to 1956 when the school closed. Principal Saunders was placed as principal at Linden Grade School after the school closed. The portion of Water Street where the building is located from Washington Ave to the Dead end was renamed EB Saunders Way sometime in the 1990s in honor of the former beloved principal. ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in Clarksburg, West Virginia Category:Defunct schools in West Virginia Category:Educational institutions disestablished in 1956 Category:Educational institutions established in 1903 Category:Former school buildings in the United States Category:Historically segregated African-American schools in West Virginia Category:Schools in Harrison County, West Virginia Category:1903 establishments in West Virginia ","title":"Kelly Miller High School"},{"id":"20527270","text":"Fredensborg () is a railway town located in Fredensborg Municipality, North Zealand, some 30 kilometres north of Copenhagen, Denmark.

In 1945, his mother and two siblings, fled from the Red Army and ended up in Berlin, where he went to school and spent his entire youth. During his school days, he started playing the violin and piano becoming good enough to earn a free three year scholarship to the Berlin Conservatory. During that time, he \\"lost interest\\" in practicing the violin and concentrated on the piano, trying to play Jazz. Not an easy task, playing \\"by ear\\", without any money to buy written arrangements or sheet music. Selchow's playing was good enough for a student band but, having listened to the piano 'Greats', he soon realised that he would never reach their level. While others continued to perform, he stopped playing in public. In 1958, Selchow began studying at the University of Braunschweig, to become a teacher as well. In 1961 he began working as a teacher and retired being a principal in 1995. Selchow is married and has four married children. He has five grandchildren and as of 2019 four great grandchildren. His passion for jazz started in Berlin at the age of 12, where he and his friend often got together, to listen to the few, old 78 shellac records they owned. It was during those years that many of the great Jazz musicians came to Berlin. Selchow would rarely miss an opportunity to see one of the greats, like Roy Eldridge, Buck Clayton, Bill Harris, Lester Young, Flip Phillips, Illinois Jacquet, Oscar Peterson, Ray Brown, Gene Krupa, Louie Bellson and others with \\"Jazz at the Philharmonic\\". Many of the great bands came through as well: Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Woody Herman. Lionel Hampton did come several times and became a favorite of young Selchow. In 1955 Louis Armstrong came to the \\"Berlin Sportpalast\\", bringing along one of Manfred Selchow's \\"heroes\\" -- Edmond Hall. Selchow remembers: \\"I had heard him before on records, but seeing him there, that was something else! A love was born.\\" Berlin saw them all, all the greats - Billie Holiday, Coleman Hawkins, Red Norvo, Benny Goodman, and many more. Since 1986 Selchow has organized and accompanied 33 jazz tours in Germany and Switzerland. Selchow had the opportunity to meet many of the great legends, like Wild Bill Davison, Yank Lawson, Ralph Sutton, Jack Lesberg, Norris Turney, Oliver Jackson, Nat Pierce, Peanuts Hucko and Bob Haggart many of whom became friends of his. Selchow continues to promote and host concerts near his home in North West Germany. Many of the best musicians from around the world including Australia, UK, Italy, Austria, France, Finland, Belgium, The Netherlands, Japan and Germany have performed together in 50 concerts so far. Dan Barrett, Enrico Tomasso, Stephanie Trick, Bobby Worth, Duke Heitger, Rossano Sportiello, Frank Roberscheuten, Engelbert Wrobel, Antti Sarpila, Ken Peplowski, Butch Miles, Chris Hopkins, Nikki Parrott and Menno Daams are just a few of the current high caliber musicians that jump at the chance to visit when invited. Selchow was also an International Member of the (now defunct) Association of Jazz Record Collectors. His collection contains about 3,000 LPs, 4500 CDs, hundreds of 78s and more than 7,000 tape cassettes. He also owns a collection of about 200 films of rare jazz music footage. == Publications == * * * == Critical reception == The books have received a positive reception from critics.

The outbreak began in Chitungwiza in Mashonaland East Province in August 2008, then spread throughout the country so that by December 2008, cases were being reported in all 10 provinces. In December 2008, The Zimbabwean government declared the outbreak a national emergency and requested international aid. The outbreak peaked in January 2009 with 8,500 cases reported per week. Cholera cases from this outbreak were also reported in neighboring countries South Africa, Malawi, Botswana, Mozambique, and Zambia. With the help of international agencies, the outbreak was controlled, and by July 2009, after no cases had been reported for several weeks, the Zimbabwe Ministry of Health and Child Welfare declared the outbreak over. In total, 98,596 cases of cholera and 4,369 deaths were reported, making this the largest outbreak of cholera ever recorded in Zimbabwe. The large scale and severity of the outbreak has been attributed to poor sanitation, limited access to healthcare, and insufficient healthcare infrastructure throughout Zimbabwe. == Cause == An open drain in Kuwadzana township, Harare in 2004. By 2008 drains such as this were carrying sewage from burst sewage pipes and feces washed out of the neighbouring areas as the urban sanitation system collapsed. This contributed to the rapid spread of the cholera outbreak. The 2008 cholera outbreak was caused by widespread infection with the bacterium Vibrio cholerae which is spread through water contaminated with the feces of infected individuals. Cholera had been seen in Zimbabwe in the decade leading up to the 2008 outbreak. However, the severity of the 2008 has been attributed to a combination of societal factors including poor access to health care and poor health care infrastructure, high HIV prevalence, political instability, food shortages, high levels of displaced people, and lack of access to safe water. In 2008, Zimbabwe was suffering from an economic crisis and hyperinflation which led to shortages of food and other basic goods, disruption of public services, and a large number of refugees moving within the country and to neighboring countries. One of the major contributing factors to the outbreak was the breakdown of the municipal water supply, sanitation, and waste collection programs throughout the country, but especially in urban areas. With this, the onset of the rainy season led to cholera-contaminated faeces being washed into water sources, in particular public drains, as well as providing readily available but contaminated water. Due to a shortage of purification chemicals, such as chlorine, the capital city of Harare stopped receiving piped water on 1 December 2008. By that date, many suburbs had not had any water supply for much longer. On 4 December 2008, the Zimbabwe deputy minister for water and infrastructural development stated that there were only sufficient treatment chemicals in stock nationally for 12 weeks supply. The collapse of these systems was blamed on the then-current economic crisis; many households cannot afford fuel to boil water. According to Médecins Sans Frontières, the spread of cholera from urban to rural areas from December 2008 onwards was due to infected city-dwellers visiting their families' rural homes for Christmas and the burial of infected city-dwellers in rural areas. The 2008 cholera epidemic in Zimbabwe had an unusually high fatality rate; Oxfam attributed the high mortality to a population \\"seriously weakened by hunger, HIV and AIDS\\". A major contributing factor to the severity of the outbreak was the collapse of Zimbabwe's public health system, declared a national emergency on 4 December 2008. By the end of November 2008, three of Zimbabwe's four major hospitals had shut down, along with the Zimbabwe Medical School, and the fourth major hospital had two wards and no operating theatres working. Zimbabwean hospitals still open by December 2008 lacked medicines and staff. Due to hyperinflation, hospitals were not able to buy basic drugs and medicines, and the resources of even internationally funded emergency clinics were stretched. The ongoing political and economic crisis contributed to the emigration of doctors and people with medical knowledge. Some victims were travelling to Botswana and other neighbouring countries for treatment. == Impact == The spread of cholera in Zimbabwe: (top) The number of cases recorded in the most infected centres and districts, and in the remainder of each province of Zimbabwe as of 4 March 2009. (bottom) Total number of reported cases. Since totals for many districts are not updated daily, the first occurrence of a case may represent the date of the reporting of that case, not the date of infection. Data sources: United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the World Health Organization, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.Zimbabwe: Cholera Outbreak. International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, 11 November 2008 and news media,Zimbabwe Humanitarian Situation Report On Cholera Outbreak, United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, 12 September 2008. The 2008 outbreak began in Chitungwiza on 20 August 2008. In September, cases spread to the urban areas of Makonde and Chinhoyi. By the end of October, cases had spread to 3 provinces: Mashonaland West, Mashonaland East, and Harare city. In the first two weeks of November, the epidemic rapidly spread across Zimbabwe, appearing in a total of 9 provinces and 54 districts. The disease spread to reach all of Zimbabwe's ten provinces. The attack rate was highest in Beitbridge, Chegutu, Mudzi and Zvimba Districts (above 1,000 cases per 100,000 people or 1.0%). The number of cases reported by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs escalated from 30 on 1 September 2008 to 15,572 by 10 December. According to the Red Cross, around 46% of reported deaths occur en route to clinics and hospitals. The head of the British Department for International Development in Harare said that \\"there are probably twice as many people with cholera as turn up for treatment\\". The case fatality rate for the outbreak was higher than expected for such outbreaks, although it began declining by January 2009. Official estimates of fatalities have run from 484 to 800, since the outbreak in August 2008, with an upper estimate of 3,000 from an anonymous senior official in the Ministry of Health and Child Welfare. Fatality rates varied from 2.5% in Harare to 18% in Chitungwiza. In Harare, the crisis reached the extent that the city council offered free graves to cholera victims. By 7 December, Oxfam estimated 60,000 cases by the end of January 2009 and a 10% fatality rate, with UNICEF giving a similar estimate. On 4 December 2008, the Zimbabwe government declared the outbreak to be a national emergency. == Response == Assistance after the 2008 outbreak was made available by numerous international agencies, and funding for water, sanitation and hygiene programmes, epidemic response and the provision of essential drugs came from several governments and trans-governmental organisations: { class=\\" table\\" - !

UNICEF distributed 360,000 litres of water per day in Harare, as well as handing out soap and buckets. Notwithstanding the contributions received, UNICEF indicated on 9 December 2008 that US$17,500,000 was needed to respond properly to the outbreak. As of 15 December, following agreement with the Zimbabwe government, the World Health Organization was procuring medical supplies to roll out a response plan to run health centres. ==Spread == 350pxthumbrightSpread of cholera within southern Africa, as of 10 February 2009. Not all cases are part of the 2008–2009 Zimbabwean cholera outbreak. Key: █ Deaths recorded █ Infections recorded The 2008 cholera outbreak spread to districts in Botswana, Mozambique, South Africa and Zambia bordering Zimbabwe. ===South Africa=== Cholera spread to the Zimbabwean migrant worker community in Limpopo and Mpumalanga provinces of South Africa and cholera bacteria were detected in the Limpopo River on 3 December 2008. By 12 December 2008, 11 deaths and 859 infections had been recorded in South Africa, rising to 2,100 cases and 15 deaths by 14 January 2009, and to 12,000 cases and 59 deaths by 10 March.AFP S.Africa cholera outbreak 'declining' The South African government set up medical facilities and drinking water supplies at the Beitbridge border post and deployed the National Outbreak Response Team and additional medical personnel to Musina. Anthony Turton, a political scientist and Unit Fellow with the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) in South Africa, who had earlier warned of the risk of cholera in South Africa and wrote a report that recommended that the South African government increase its spending on water treatments lest a cholera outbreak occur in the country, was suspended for having made \\"inappropriate statements to the media\\". On 10 December 2008, the Limpopo Provincial Government declared Vhembe District Municipality, which borders Zimbabwe at Beitbridge, Matabeleland South province, a disaster area. On a 28 January 2009 visit to Musina with high- ranking government and ruling party officials, Health Minister Barbara Hogan said ===Other countries=== The spread of cholera to Zimbabwe's other neighbouring countries was initially slower than in South Africa, with one death recorded in Kafue District in Zambia and none in Botswana or Namibia by 9 December 2008. In 2009, cases increased, with 4,354 cases and 55 deaths reported by 10 February 2009 in Zambia and 1,596 cases and 14 deaths in Katanga, the southernmost province of the DR Congo. In Mozambique, cholera spread to 10 out of 11 provinces, with a total of 9,533 cases by 1 Jan to 1 Mar 2009 and 119 deaths by 17 March.AFP:12 Mozambican prisoners die after cholera riot Four health workers also died in a mob attack, blamed on \\"misinformation and misunderstanding in efforts to combat cholera\\", and 12 of the prisoners from the incident died in jail. In Malawi 104 deaths were recorded since January, making it the worst outbreak since 2001–02 where 960 people died. Kenya, Somalia, Tanzania, DRC, and Ghana have had unrelated cholera outbreaks with between 10 and 100 deaths in 2009 as of February. ==Prevention== After the 2008 epidemic was declared a national emergency, the Ministry of Health and Child Welfare (MOHCW) collaborated with several other departments, governments, and non-governmental organizations to create a Cholera Command and Control Centre. This centre works to prevent cholera outbreaks in Zimbabwe by addressing broader societal factors that could contribute to cholera outbreaks, such as water sanitation and poor hygiene habits. == Politicisation == Because of its well-organised health care system and effective water sanitation facilities, Rita R. Colwell of the James Baker Institute says Zimbabwe was historically one of the African countries least affected by cholera. A news commentary in The Lancet said that, under President Robert Mugabe, the country's health programs were negatively impacted, resulting in diminished health care for those infected with cholera. According to a draft paper from the WHO's World Conference on Social Determinants in Health, there were fewer health workers in the villages than in urban areas, which hindered early detection and isolation of cholera cases. A news commentator writing for The Lancet, Andrew Meldrum, said that President Mugabe's Youth Militia threatened health professionals that provided medical treatment to political opponents. He said that, combined with decreasing education standards, low pay, and a shortage of medical supplies like latex gloves, this led doctors to leave Zimbabwe at an alarming rate. According to Douglas Gwatidzo, the chairman of the Zimbabwe Doctors for Human Rights group, Zimbabwe had only one doctor assigned to a group of 12,000 citizens. Doctors in Zimbabwe fill only 25% of the medical posts available, and even fewer specialist positions are taken. According to Meldrum, this poses serious challenges to health care for diseases like HIV/AIDS and cholera. Similarly, the effects of cholera are exacerbated without proper nutrition, and Zimbabwe has faced food shortages for the last several years. Cholera and malnutrition keep children out of school – a serious social consequence of the outbreak. Rachel Pound, the director of Save the Children in Zimbabwe, said that attending school may be dangerous in Zimbabwe, instead of providing a ladder for self-improvement. She noted that \\"Sanitation is now so bad in schools that they may become a breeding ground for infection\\", rather than a place of valuable education. According to Meldrum, Zimbabwe's high inflation left the country with a lack of financial resources, resulting in a shortage of ambulances and pharmaceutical drugs. According to Eric Pruyt of the Delft University of Technology in The Netherlands, this was exacerbated by a shortage of international aid, as Zimbabwe's government didn't acknowledge the epidemic and accept aid until the disease was widespread. It was not contained or prevented from spreading. Until 2008, the government insisted that there was no cholera in Zimbabwe, and Pruyt says the U.N. did not provide the country with safe drinking water until after the crisis started. Meldrum says that, during Zimbabwe's continuing HIV/AIDS dilemma, some major international donors did not give much money because they believed it would help President Mugabe stay in power, which they did not want. As the outbreak and health crisis grew worse, American and British leaders cited the crisis as further proof that it was, in their view, \\"well past time for (President) Robert Mugabe to leave\\" and that Zimbabwe had become a failed state. Marian Tupy of the Cato Institute said that the crisis began in 2005 when the government took over water treatment facilities but without sufficient funding to maintain purification processes. The transfer of water treatment from local government to the Zimbabwe National Water Authority was criticized by Innocent Nhapi of the National University of Rwanda on the basis of capacity and funding of the authority. The lack of funding for water treatment chemicals, maintenance and staff salaries was cited by Colwell of the Baker Institute as a major cause of the epidemic. According to Colwell, before funds were diverted from the plants to other uses, there were only sixty-five cases and four deaths from cholera in Zimbabwe. According to an editorial by Daniel J Ncayiyana in the South African Medical Journal, President Mugabe blamed the U.S. and the U.K. for the cholera outbreak, saying that they sent the disease so that they have a reason to credibly remove him from the presidency. One Zimbabwean citizen was shown with a sign that blamed UK Prime Minister Gordan Brown for the disease; the sign expressed the horrors of \\"Brown’s cholera\\". According to a news report in Al Jazeera, the Zimbabwe government and state media blamed the outbreak on European and American sanctions and a Reuters report said it accused Britain of plotting an invasion under the cover of the outbreak. Information minister Sikhanyiso Ndlovu blamed the cholera deaths on Western sanctions, saying \\"the cholera issue has been used to drive a wedge among us\\". On 12 December, Ndlovu repeated his accusation, and claimed that the cholera outbreak was actually a \\"serious biological-chemical weapon\\" attack by the United Kingdom, which Ndlovu asserted was trying to commit genocide. Said Ndlovu: In the meantime, a senior ZANU-PF official argued that the government and party leadership was more focussed on the forthcoming ZANU-PF conference than on the current crisis. On 11 December 2008, President Robert Mugabe made a speech screened on national television in which he said: Reports from the WHO contradicted Mugabe's view and indicated a growing death toll. According to the WHO, as of 8 December nearly 800 people had died of cholera and more than 16,000 cases were being treated. Later that same day, Zimbabwean visas were denied to six French aid workers, including three crisis management specialists, two epidemiologists and a water treatment expert. Britain's Africa minister, Mark Malloch-Brown, dismissed Mugabe's claim that the Zimbabwe cholera crisis is over, commenting as follows: The French foreign ministry and USAID also contradicted Mugabe's statements and called on him to allow aid to reach the people in need. == See also == * Health in Zimbabwe * Water supply and sanitation in Zimbabwe * Cholera outbreaks and pandemics * 2018–2019 Zimbabwe cholera outbreak ==ReferencesExternal links== * Cholera situation in Zimbabwe – UN OCHA * UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, Zimbabwe * World Health Organization Alert: Cholera in Zimbabwe * World Health Organization: Daily Cholera Updates * US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention Notice: Cholera in Zimbabwe and Neighboring Countries * Zimbabwe cholera crisis (Oxfam) * Zimbabwe cholera crisis (Red Cross) Category:2000s disease outbreaks Category:2008 in Zimbabwe Category:2008 health disasters Category:2009 in Zimbabwe Category:2009 health disasters 2008 Category:Disease outbreaks in Zimbabwe ","title":"2008 Zimbabwean cholera outbreak"},{"id":"20527494","text":"Habib Sy is a Senegalese politician, currently serving as Director of the Cabinet of the President of Senegal.

In an open letter to BPP’s vice chancellor, students on the BPP University Legal Practice Course revealed that the law school’s class sizes had more than quadrupled in the wake of COVID-19, with 15-person classes now containing up to 70 students. In the letter, BPP students claimed “BPP University’s response to lockdown and Coronavirus has only served to create an environment of mistrust and anxiety for students, severely degrade the quality of teaching and assessment, and push as many costs of adjusting to lockdown onto students.” On 22 July 2020, The Lawyer reported that many BPP students were locked out of exams due to IT failures and had demanded a partial refund of their fees “based on the period of time students were unable to use BPP facilities.” On 12 August 2020, the Junior Lawyers Division of the Law Society of England and Wales, which represents LPC students across England and Wales, questioned the University’s decision to charge students registered at its London campuses higher fees than regional counterparts despite the switch to online education, and urged BPP to “take the time to talk with the group” and handle student concerns moving forward. ==Programmes== The school is a vocational provider of the Legal Practice Course (LPC) for future Solicitors. The school also offers the Bar Training Course (BTC) (formerly known as the Bar Professional Training Course, or the BPTC) for future barristers and awards the Graduate Diploma in Law (GDL) (for those coming directly from a non-LL.B. qualification), Graduate LL.B.
