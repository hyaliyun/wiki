As a potato breeder he created Rector, Bishop and Templar. ==Life== He was born in St Andrews the second son of James Wilson FRHS, a horticulturalist and owner of Greenside Nurseries. He was educated at Madras College in St Andrews. He then had a horticulturalist apprentice at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Edinburgh from around 1872. In Edinburgh he undertook formal studies in Botany at Edinburgh University. He then studied Forestry in classes at the Botanic Gardens, winning a first class certificate. In 1886 he returned to St Andrews University to obtain a degree in Natural History. From 1887 he was a Demonstrator in the Botany class. He graduated BSc in 1888.http://www.madrascollegearchive.org.uk/Pupils/biographies/former/fps/johnhardiewilson.htm He gained a doctorate (DSc) in 1889, founding the University Science Club in the same year. He was also highly involved in creating the University Botanic Garden (a teaching garden).

In 1891 he created a teaching garden at the Morgan Academy in Dundee assisted by the older but less experienced Patrick Geddes. In 1891 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were William Carmichael M'Intosh, Hugh Cleghorn, Sir Isaac Bayley Balfour and John M . MacFarlane. In 1894 he reappears in St Andrews University, lecturing in Agriculture, but from 1894 to 1897 lectured in Botany at Leeds University. He returned to St Andrews in 1898. In 1899 the Royal Horticultural Society awarded him the Banksian Medal. In 1908 the Royal Caledonian Horticultural Society awarded him the Neill Prize. During the First World War all the university's gardeners were called up and Wilson took on the role of maintaining the garden single-handed. This allegedly contributed to his death.

It was the largest military parade and mass pageant in Chinese history. The Communist Party General Secretary, President and Central Military Commission Chairman Xi Jinping, who was the guest of honour, gave the holiday address to the nation and Chinese expatriates before inspecting the formations along Chang'an Avenue. Premier Li Keqiang was the master of ceremonies and General Yi Xiaoguang was the chief commander of the parade. == Background == The Communist Party of China had defeated the Kuomintang Party following the Chinese Civil War, which occurred intermittently between 1927 and 1950 In the aftermath of the civil war, the Kuomintang and its loyalists then retreated to the island of Taiwan, formerly a prefecture of the Qing Empire, which had been under Japanese colonial rule from 1895 to 1945. The founding of the People's Republic of China was formally proclaimed by Mao Zedong, the Chairman of the Communist Party of China, on 1 October 1949 at 3:00 pm in Tiananmen Square in Beijing, the new capital (Nanking had been the capital of the former Republic of China). The first public parade of the then new People's Liberation Army took place there, following the chairman's address of the formal foundation of the new republic. Before this, as the national anthem March of the Volunteers was played, the new national flag of the People's Republic of China was officially unveiled to the newly founded nation and hoisted for the first time during the celebrations as a 21-gun salute fired in the distance. In its early years, the People's Republic of China was not internationally recognized as the Republic of China held its seat in the United Nations and the Security Council as the sole legitimate government of \\"China\\" by the United States and western nations. In 1971, the PRC was admitted to the United Nations and thus excluded the ROC from United Nations membership. Since the establishment of the PRC, celebrations of varying scales occur on National Day each year. Military parades, presided over by chairman Mao Zedong, were held every year between 1949 and 1959, the first decade of the PRC. In September 1960, the Chinese leadership decided that to save funds and \\"be frugal\\", large-scale ceremonies for National Day would only be held every ten years, with a smaller-scale ceremony every five years.(The tradition of the yearly parade, though, would be partially revived with parades held in 1969 and 1970.) Since China's opening and reform, the most prominent National Day celebrations have taken place in 1984, 1999, and 2009 at the 35th, 50th and 60th anniversaries respectively. The 70th national anniversary parade was the fifth major parade since Xi Jinping took power as General Secretary of the Communist Party of China (China's paramount leader) and Chairman of the Central Military Commission (Commander-in-chief) in 2012, and occurred with the mass protests in Hong Kong that have been on-going since 9 June as backdrop. == Preparations == Preparations underway in Tiananmen Square for the National Day Parade The official logo for the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China was officially unveiled by the State Council Information Office on 3 June 2019. Many celebrations throughout China and overseas Chinese communities have been planned for the year of 2019. In early September, rehearsals took place in central Beijing for the military parade. General Cai Zhijun of the Joint General Staff said in a press briefing that it will not be targeted \\"at any countries or districts\\" but rather would be \\"committed to safeguarding world peace and regional stability\\". It is expected to be bigger than the parades commemorating the 50th and 60th anniversary of the PRC, as well as the 2015 China Victory Day Parade. The capital has been covered with red flags, adorning apartment compounds and neighbourhoods; banners reading \\"Today's China is the result of the work of Chinese people\\" have been draped across overpasses, and topiaries have been installed around the roads in Beijing. The authorities have given out 620,000 television sets allowing those not invited to still be able to watch the festivities. Although a massive National Day fireworks display had been planned along the harbour in Hong Kong to celebrate the 70th anniversary ‚Äì as it has done every year since 1997, Hong Kong government cancelled them \\"for safety reasons\\" over the protests in the city that have lasted since March. A more low-key celebration has been planned in the territory. === Security === The city of Beijing was in virtual lockdown in the run-up to the anniversary. Objects that could overfly the capital ‚Äì for example kites, balloons, drones and even pigeons ‚Äì were banned. The use of walkie-talkies and other devices using radio waves, alcohol also joined the list of things that were disallowed. Weeks before the anniversary, motorists were prohibited from refuelling their cars or motorcycles on their own. During rehearsals for a military parade to mark the day, residents close to Tiananmen Square received instructions to stay away from windows and to keep their curtains drawn. Guests in hotels in the vicinity of Tiananmen Square were told that for several hours each day, they would not be able to leave or return to it for hours at a time. Shops and restaurants in the centre closed or shortened their opening hours; some metro stations were closed temporarily. == Media == A sign celebrating the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic in Tianjin China Central Television (CCTV) is expected to mainly broadcast synchronously for domestic and foreign TV channels with CCTV-1 as the producing channel for the celebrations, while national, provincial and city broadcasters and TV stations, domestic internet video, portals, and live webcast sites may also broadcast the event simultaneously via the CCTV-1 feed. The China Media Group, holding firm of the CCTV network and the CGTN international channels, may also broadcast live overseas through websites such as YouTube not just in Mandarin Chinese but also in many languages. In addition, China National Radio and China Radio International serve as the official radio stations of the festivities. On 4 September 2019, the CMG held a mobilization meeting to celebrate the 70th anniversary. More than 260 representatives from its member companies attended the event. As the focus of the celebration, the company's radio and television units are bound to take publicity reporting of the celebrations seriously. The China TV News published on 19 September announced on the front page that the second issue (published on the 26th) will disclose the relevant live broadcast arrangements of the China Media Group to the event. Various overseas media also paid attention to the coverage of this event, and those who have met the conditions may broadcast it around the world. The \\"press centre for the celebration of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China\\" is located in Beijing's Media Center and was officially launched on 23 September. A \\"special clean-up operation\\" targeting \\"harmful political information\\" and any Sina Weibo accounts or posts that \\"distort the history of the party and the country\\". Furthermore, the china has intensified the crackdown on virtual private networks that allow users to access websites blocked in the republic, to the extent that it even drew criticism from the editor-in-chief of the Global Times in a Sina Weibo post that has since been deleted. == Musical concert == To mark the special anniversary of national foundation, on Sunday, 29 September, the celebrations began with the CCTV-produced musical concert gala The Nation Moves Onward aired nationwide on CCTV-1 live from the Great Auditorium of the Beijing Great Hall of the People, in which CMC Chairman and General Secretary of the Communist Party Xi Jinping attended as guest of honour together with other party and national leaders, veterans of the PLA and other invited guests. == Wreath-laying ceremony at the Monument to the People's Heroes == The 15th annual wreath laying ceremony in honour of the heroes and martyrs of the Chinese nation and people was held in earnest on 30 September, National Memorial Day, on the grounds of Tiananmen Square in which CMC Chairman and General Secretary of the Communist Party Xi Jinping attended as guest of honour, together with other party and national leaders, veterans of the PLA, distinguished citizens, the Young Pioneers and representatives of the civil service and the private sector, in which flowers and wreaths were laid in the Monument to the People's Heroes. This was an idea introduced by former paramount leader Hu Jintao in 2004 to honour the millions of Chinese who perished in the many decades of national struggle of the 19th and 20th centuries. In an earlier ceremony at the Great Hall of the People, 42 individuals, including several foreigners, were awarded by paramount leader Xi as part of the National Day honours list (several of the awards were posthumous) with national orders and decorations for merit and service to the republic and people as well as to contributing to enhanced ties with foreign countries. == Civil-military parade == KJ-2000 and J-10s started the flypast formation The big highlight of the celebrations of the anniversary was the grand civil military parade held on 1 October in the grounds of Tiananmen Square to mark this special anniversary of the foundation of the PRC. With an estimated 15,000 marching in the ground column, 600 vehicles in the mobile column and around 180 in the flypast column, alongside a more than 110,000 strong civil column, it was the biggest ever civil-military parade to be held in the history of the PRC. The traditional card stunt display, introduced in 1955, was officially abolished for this year following the success of the 2015 Victory Day parade, and thus on that day audience stands were in place in the grounds of the Square in its place, reflecting the crowds that were there 70 years ago during the foundation ceremony. This was the first parade to include three colour guards representing the flag of the CPC, the Flag of China and the flag of the PLA (in that order) have been incorporated in the guard of honour. General Secretary Xi recognized the colours prior to inspecting the troops in another National Day first. ===Leaders in attendance=== *Xi Jinping (General Secretary, President and CMC chairman) *Jiang

Apart from World War II, Thompson primarily taught English from 1939 to 1968 before teaching Belles- lettres from 1968 until his 1973 retirement. Outside of academics, Thompson wrote multiple books on American poets including a three-part biography on Robert Frost. Thompson's first part of his biography on Frost, Robert Frost: The Early Years, 1874-1915 was nominated for the 1967 National Book Award for Arts and Letters. Years later, Thompson won the 1971 Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography for his second part of his biography titled Robert Frost: The Years of Triumph, 1915‚Äì1938. After Thompson died in 1973 while writing the final part of his Frost biography, Robert Frost: The Later Years, 1938-1963 was posthumously completed by Thompson's assistant R.H. Winnick in 1976. ==Early life and education== Thompson was born on 3 April 1906 in Franklin, New Hampshire. For his post-secondary education, Thompson received a Bachelor of Arts from Wesleyan University in 1928 and a Doctor of Philosophy from Columbia University in 1939. ==Career== While completing his studies, Thompson began his career as an English professor at Wesleyan and Columbia from 1934 to 1936. After completing a year-long fellowship at Columbia, Thompson moved to Princeton University in 1937 and became the university's library curator. After working solely as curator for a couple of years, Thompson simultaneously held the positions of curator and assistant English professor from 1939 to 1942. During World War II, Thompson was a member of the United States Navy Reserve and was awarded the Legion of Merit. After the war, Thompson remained as an assistant professor until his promotion to associate professor in 1947. For the remainder of his stint at Princeton, Thompson was an English professor from 1951 to 1968 and a professor in Belles-lettres from 1968 to 1973. Apart from his academic tenures, Thompson started writing literature about Robert Frost and Edwin Arlington Robinson throughout the early 1930s. In 1939, Thompson was selected by Frost to become his biographer after the death of Frost's previous appointment R.S. Newdick. After writing multiple works about Frost between the 1940s to 1960s, Thompson published the first of his three part biography on Frost in 1966, titled Robert Frost: The Early Years, 1874-1915. Thompson's second accompanying volume on Frost, Robert Frost: The Years of Triumph, 1915‚Äì1938 was released a few years later in 1970.Ingerbretsen 1991, pp. 275-76 When Thompson died in 1973 while writing the final volume of his Frost biography, his assistant R.H. Winnick completed Robert Frost: The Later Years, 1938-1963 and made the book available in 1976. Additional authors that Thompson wrote about throughout his life include Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Herman Melville and William Faulkner. ==Awards and honors== Thompson received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1945 in the field of American literature. For awards, Thompson was a 1967 National Book Award for Arts and Letters nominee for Robert Frost: The Early Years, 1874-1915 and won the 1971 Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography for Robert Frost: The Years of Triumph, 1915‚Äì1938. ==Personal life== Thompson was married and had four children. ==Death== On 15 April 1973, Thompson died in Princeton, New Jersey. ==References== Category:1906 births Category:1973 deaths Category:Academics from New Hampshire Category:American librarians Category:Wesleyan University faculty Category:Columbia University faculty Category:Columbia University fellows Category:Princeton University faculty Category:20th-century American biographers Category:Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography winners ","title":"Lawrance Thompson"},{"id":"61332750","text":"√ñmer Berke Toka√ß (born 26 November 2000) is a Turkish footballer who currently plays as a forward for Shonan Bellmare. ==Career statisticsClub=== . {  style=\\"text-align: center\\" - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Club !rowspan=\\"2\\"Season !colspan=\\"3\\"League !colspan=\\"2\\"Cup !colspan=\\"2\\"Other !colspan=\\"2\\"Total - !Division !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals - Shonan Bellmare 2019 J1 League 10000010 - ! colspan=3  Career total !1!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!1!!0 } ;Notes ==ReferencesCategory:2000 births Category:Living people Category:Turkish footballers Category:Turkey youth international footballers Category:German footballers Category:German people of Turkish descent Category:Turkish expatriate footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:J1 League players Category:Bayer 04 Leverkusen players Category:Shonan Bellmare players Category:Turkish expatriate sportspeople in Japan Category:German expatriate sportspeople in Japan Category:Expatriate footballers in Japan ","title":"√ñmer Toka√ß"},{"id":"61332757","text":"Jail Caesar is a 2012 British-South African-Canadian historical drama film written and directed by Paul Schoolman and starring Derek Jacobi, John Kani and Alice Krige. ==PlotCast== *Derek Jacobi as Sulla *John Kani as Marius *Alice Krige as Pirate Captain *Warren Adler as Caesar *Peter John Christiaans as Cicero *Richard Clifford as Marcus Thermus *Grant Swamby as Crassus *Gunter Singer as The Swooper *Vaneshran Arumugam as Cinna *Grethe Fox as Nicopolis *Bo Petersen as Aurelia *Denwor Ohlson as Mr. O ==References* Category:English-language films Category:Afrikaans-language films Category:Xhosa-language films Category:British films Category:Canadian films Category:South African films Category:Films about Julius Caesar ","title":"Jail Caesar"},{"id":"61332771","text":"Lisa Quick (born 24 April 1975) is an English snooker and pool player.

Police believe many of the staff belonged to a child sex abuse ring. Seven former officers were jailed for abusing detainees, receiving sentences totalling nearly 34 years. Two were convicted of sexual offences in 1990, 2003 and 2005, while the other five were jailed for physical abuse in 2019. ==Context== Medomsley Detention Centre was operated by the Home Office and built in 1960 on what was once a Victorian orphanage. It opened in February 1961 and closed in the late 1980s. It usually held around 70 young detainees, mostly from northern England, and could hold 130. Inmates were typically there for their first offence and for a minor crime, the penalty for which would nowadays be a non-custodial community sentence. The site reopened as the private Hassockfield Secure Training Centre from 1999 to 2015. In June 2019, plans were proposed to redevelop the site for housing. Medomsley held young males from Northern England and Scotland and was one of several prisons intended to separate youths from older criminals where former inmates have since reported sexual, physical and emotional abuse, leading to addiction and suicide. ===\\"Short, sharp shock\\" policy=== Detective Adrian Green who led Operation Seabrook said Margaret Thatcher's severe \\"short, sharp shock\\" policy for punishing young offenders may have been used as a cover for abuse by Medomsley officers. The policy involved incarcerating boys convicted of minor misdemeanors in what have since been described as \\"sadistic, brutal concentration camps\\", where inmates were routinely humiliated and violently and sexually assaulted. Inmates were routinely physically attacked for not saying \\"sir\\" when addressing a guard and were often forced to stand naked, visible to guards, for long periods of time. Margaret Thatcher's government argued the policy would deter further crime. David Greenwood, a representative of child abuse victims in detention centres, said detainees only became law- abiding in a minority of cases he was aware of and \\"the majority have their lives sent down the other path with this kind of treatment, especially with sexual abuse as well.\\" One bereaved relative, whose brother Mark turned to heroin and died of an overdose after being incarcerated for a crime he didn't commit in one such centre in Kent, where inmates \\"were always beaten up\\", said abusive prison guards \\"had the impression this was authorised by Maggie Thatcher, as if they were on direct orders from the Prime Minister to carry out this abuse\\". Mark was \\"punished\\" for trying to appeal even after the real guilty person confessed. He was forced to stand naked for more than 24 hours while others, including staff, walked past. He is believed to have been sexually abused. Inmates at Eastwood Park in Gloucestershire were constantly subjected to \\"waves and waves of verbal and physical abuse\\". Inmates were routinely deprived of sleep by \\"constant banging noises\\", guards talking into the PA system and guards \\"kicking cell doors loudly\\". During the day, inmates were arbitrarily sworn at by guards and were kicked and punched for frivolous reasons such as insufficiently rolled up sleeves or alleged uncombed hair. \\"Uncomfortable and intimidating\\" guards watched inmates showering. One victim recalled being forced to stand naked upon his arrival along with two others \\"for what felt like hours\\" while guards stared at them and verbally abused them. More than 30 years later, he still had \\"emotional scars\\" that \\"will stay with me forever\\". Inmates at Kirklevington Detention Centre, North Yorkshire, \\"were physically abused on a daily basis\\" by officers who \\"were just sadistic and seemed to enjoy abusing young boys\\". All inmates were subjected to daily violence and were deprived of food and of meaningful contact with their families, with the contents of letters home being dictated to inmates. One victim who was incarcerated in Kirklevington as a 14-year-old boy feared for his life and emerged as \\"an anti-authoritarian criminal\\", from then on viewing authority \\"as the enemy\\". He said \\"I went on to spend most of my life in and out of prisons.\\" Whatton Detention Centre, Nottinghamshire, was described as \\"terrifying for everybody\\". Former inmate James Carr√©-Rice \\"spiralled into violence\\" and repeatedly reoffended when released. The 15-year-old was punched in the face immediately upon arrival for not saying \\"sir\\" to an officer. Once inside, inmates had their self-esteem constantly lowered by guards verbally abusing and insulting them and were all \\"beaten, punished, humiliated\\". Carr√©- Rice recalled children crying during the night. His friend was severely beaten for dancing in a hallway, and less than a month after being released, hung himself. In 2014, North West Durham's MP, Pat Glass, criticised the phrase \\"short, sharp shock\\" because it created \\"a culture in which a group of people is seen as less than the rest\\", which is when \\"things start to go wrong\\". She said the abuse at Medomsley \\"cannot have been happening in isolation\\" and was part of a wider culture of abuse. ==Abuse== Inmates in Medomsley were sexually and physically abused, spanning several decades from the 1960s to the late 1980s. The physical abuse sometimes resulted in hospitalisations due to severe injuries, including broken bones, wounds and loss of consciousness. Many inmates were raped by staff. The wide variety of physical abuse and humiliation incidents included detainees being dragged from the toilets semi- naked for not finishing soon enough or for not preparing food quickly, being dragged by the hair during a beating, being force-fed salt for speaking during a meal, being punched for not saying \\"sir\\" to officers, almost drowning while locked in a box that was filled with water similar to water-boarding, being knocked from a 20-foot height then forced to walk with a broken back and being kicked, stamped on and pelted with heavy objects. One victim said prison officers also orchestrated violence by inmates, having noticed that while he was \\"being kicked and punched and slapped\\", he \\"saw a prison officer at the door smiling.\\" He said: \\"They were telling you that you were worthless, that's why you were in there, you were no good, nobody wanted you.\\" Police believe many of the staff belonged to an \\"organised paedophile ring\\". In 1970, Neville Husband, the chef and later a church cleric, moved to Medomsley where he raped inmates every day for 15 years. The MP Laura Pidcock described the centre in her constituency as \\"a living hell\\". ===Concealment=== The public was prevented from learning of the abuse in various ways. Rape victims were silenced with death threats and beatings. At least 14 victims were ignored by police when they tried reporting the abuse upon their release, with rape victim Kevin Young being silenced with threats of being returned to Medomsley. Tony Skillen, whose skull was broken by a violent prison guard, was forced to pretend to hospital staff that the injury was accidental. Relatives of David Caldwel, a chronic asthma sufferer, believe his inquest ignored the role of extreme physical training that was forced by violent prison guards in triggering his fatal asthma attack. The Home Office dismissed and denied numerous reports of abuse. Serial rapist Neville Husband used a kitchen store room as a bedroom containing sexual paraphernalia, where he forced a boy to sleep each night. He concealed the nightly rapes by prohibiting staff from searching the kitchen area. An officer testified \\"We knew something was going on, he ‚Äì Husband ‚Äì used to keep a boy behind in the kitchen at night, we always felt sorry for that boy.\\" In 2019, Operation Seabrook's lead investigator Detective Adrian Green found it \\"likely\\" other staff at Medomsley were aware \\"that physical and potentially sexual abuse was occurring\\" and \\"kept quiet about it\\". He added: \\"They should have intervened\\" and \\"shame on them.\\" Detective Green warned \\"If I got any evidence to suggest cases of cover-ups I would be looking to prosecute.\\" ==Investigations== Two police investigations led to seven former officers who abused Medomsley detainees being jailed for nearly 34 years in total. Operation Halter saw serial rapist Neville Husband jailed in 2003, followed by Leslie Johnson in 2005, both for sexual abuse. Their sentences totalled 16 years. Operation Seabrook resulted in five former Medomsley officers being jailed in 2019, all for physical abuse, with sentences totalling nearly 18 years. ===Operation Halter=== Operation Halter was a police investigation into sexual abuse of young inmates in Medomsley Detention Centre, which resulted in Medomsley officer Neville Husband being convicted in 2003 of sexually abusing five young inmates. He was jailed for this in February 2003 for eight years and jailed again in September 2003 for two more years for sexually assaulting another four inmates. Medomsley officer Leslie Johnson was subsequently jailed in 2005 for six years. Lead investigator Detective Simon Orton said in 2003 \\"There could be a lot more [victims of Neville Husband]. But I would anticipate there are people who have put it behind them and would simply want to leave it that way. We will have to respect that.\\" Detective Orton added \\"I can only surmise how many other people have been through his clutches.\\" ===Operation Seabrook=== On 14 August 2013, police reopened investigations into historical abuse of young inmates in Medomsley Detention Centre, naming this new investigative phase Operation Seabrook. It had three aims ‚Äì to provide victims with support \\"so they are in a better place\\", to fully understand the abuse in Medomsley, and to gather evidence against and prosecute living abusers. In March 2019, Operation Seabrook resulted in five former Medomsley officers being jailed for physically abusing detainees. The five ‚Äì Christopher Onslow, John McGee, Brian Johnson Greenwell, Alan Bramley and Kevin Blakely ‚Äì received jail terms totalling 17 years and 11 months. The investigation was carried out by 70 Detectives from Durham Constabulary. Each detective interviewed and collected statements from a different group of victims. Its leader, Detective Superintendent Paul Goundry, said they were \\"experienced detectives\\" with many of them \\"specially-trained to deal with victims of sexual abuse\\". Launching the investigation, Detective Goundry said the detectives \\"will go to see our victims in person, wherever they are, answer any queries they may have and steer them towards the appropriate counselling services if they need them. This will be a lengthy process but I am confident we have the resources in place.\\" Counselling was offered to victims by \\"The Meadows\\", a nearby Sexual Assault Referral Centre. Detective Goundry promised to \\"put victims at the heart of the inquiry\\" and asked for \\"new information about Medomsley and any abuse that occurred either inside, or when inmates were taken off-site. He said Operation Seabrook would \\"go where the evidence takes us\\" and that \\"every avenue will be explored and we‚Äôll do our utmost to bring perpetrators to justice.\\" He warned that any \\"officers who ignored evidence about a paedophile ring\\" would \\"be traced and investigated.\\" John McCabe was extremely thankful for the victim-centred investigative approach taken by Durham Constabulary, saying \\"Everything they are doing is victims focussed. They have done so much for the other victims and it means a lot me\\" and \\"When you look at the network of help they have put in place it is totally unbelievable.\\" Rod Jones, who was abused in the 1960s, said because the investigation was so late, \\"the majority of prison officers who did this are now probably dead or are in their 80s and 90s\\" and he would never receive justice. Within months of the investigation's launch, Goundry said \\"seasoned detectives have found it quite traumatic dealing with the experiences of these victims\\". By March 2014, Goundry expressed shock at \\"the sheer number of victims who have come forward\\" and said his team had \\"growing evidence\\" of \\"an organised paedophile ring\\" and a \\"brutal regime where violence was both extreme and routine\\", which ruined lives, leaving some traumatised victims unable to work or even leave their house. By February 2017, 1400 victims had reported sexual or physical abuse to Operation Seabrook. 32 suspects were identified and 32 files were provided to the Crown Prosecution Service. By November, seven were charged and a further six were warned they could be charged if any new evidence emerges against them. The Crown Prosecution Service explained that some other abusers were no longer alive or were too difficult to identify. The seven charged men were released on bail. All faced charges of physical abuse and four were also charged with sexual abuse. They denied every charge. \\\\- \\\\- In August 2018, a further 11 faced no action because of insufficient available evidence. The six former Medomsley officers who received warnings remained under investigation. \\\\- \\\\- \\\\- The investigation was made difficult by some victims not recalling names of abusers or only knowing their nicknames, by victims' backgrounds and by the length of time since the crimes. The detective now leading the investigation, Chief Superintendent Adrian Green, explained that perpetrators were identified by showing victims old photographs of Medomsley staff and \\"timelines of nicknames\\". He said \\"it becomes difficult to turn these things into evidence.\\" 71 victims appeared as witnesses in three trials in 2018 and 2019. in which five men were convicted of frequently physically attacking boys in Medomsley, causing severe bruises, bleeding, broken bones and unconsciousness. After the trials, Judge Howard Crowson praised the courage of all victims who reported the abuse. In March 2019, Detective Green said all five convicted abusers had a \\"life-long impact\\" on their victims, having \\"devastated their quality of life and their ability to cope going forward\\". He said, \\"It's never ending for those individuals, and one of the important things is that this has allowed them to have a voice for them to be heard. ... Many of these people, are very very badly damaged by what occurred and that's devastated their lives.\\" He hoped victims \\"found some solace in reporting their stories to police, being listened to, and that the issues at Medomsley are being discussed in public\\". Detective Green described Operation Seabrook as \\"incredibly long and complex\\", having taken \\"more than five years\\". Far more victims had reported abuse than expected and he praised their \\"courage\\", saying \\"it is not easy to relive such distressing incidents\\". He was \\"extremely proud\\" of the investigators who \\"worked extremely hard\\" and were \\"dedicated people\\". 23,280 documents had been gathered and the investigation cost ¬£1m. Detective Green expected \\"further charges [...] imminently\\" and asked other living victims, including those \\"who have suffered abuse in other establishments, not just Meadomsley\\" to contact Durham Police. Media restrictions News organisations were prohibited from publicising any of the verdicts or charges in three trials stemming from Operation Seabrook due to court imposed reporting restrictions, until the final verdict was delivered in March 2019. The trials had been scheduled for September 2018, November 2018 and January 2019. During these temporary restrictions, only the names and ages of the seven defendants could be reported. On 12 March 2019, following the verdict in the final trial, Judge Howard Crownson lifted the restrictions, allowing details from the three trials to finally be published. ==Victims== Over 1,800 former detainees reported sexual and extreme physical abuse by officers in Medomsley, including daily rapes and frequent severe beatings under a \\"culturally violent regime\\" that traumatised them for life. Many were so desperate to escape this criminal \\"systematic abuse\\" that they broke their own limbs in order to be hospitalised and therefore removed from Medomsley. By March 2019, around 300 victims reported abuse by Neville Husband, which Durham Constabulary expected to become \\"considerably higher\\". He was brought to justice in 2003 by Operation Halter. Husband, the chef and a church cleric, raped boys at Medomsley every day for 15 years. One of his victims, Dave Stoker said he felt \\"so disgusted\\", \\"dirty\\" and \\"ashamed\\" that Husband had successfully intimidated him into silence that he turned to alcohol and he later died of cirrhosis of the liver. 71 victims testified in three trials in 2018 and 2019 stemming from Operation Seabrook, in which five former Medomsley officers were jailed for physical abuse. The 71 witnesses described frequent physical assaults by officers that caused injuries such as broken bones and black eyes. When jailing three officers Judge Howard Crowson said victims \\"felt they could not complain, and those who did were told [that] to continue their complaints could result in a return to Medomsley.\\" During victim impact statements, one victim, who described Medomsley as \\"hell on earth\\", said it left him taking antidepressants for 30 years. He said Medomsley officers \\"seemed as though they were using us to show off to one another, laughing as they did it.\\" Others victims suffered recurring nightmares about Medomsley, even after 40 years, with at least one victim housebound, unable to work and largely out of touch with his three children, still overwhelmed by flashbacks and post traumatic stress disorder after 37 years. One victim described Medomsley as \\"a violent place\\" where prisoners were \\"treated like animals\\". Investigators said prison officers inflicted \\"immeasurable suffering and lifelong damage\\" upon \\"the most vulnerable kids in society\\" causing \\"mental scars which have lasted a lifetime\\" and that reporting the abuse \\"has taken courage\\". Judge Howard Crowson said former inmates \\"who had the courage to complain ... were either ignored or warned that to pursue the complaint would risk a return to Medomsley\\" which \\"no one wanted to risk\\", so \\"most of the victims told nobody\\". He said society at the time viewed such complaints as evidence the victim \\"had not learned his lesson\\". ===1967 reports=== In 1967, a Member of Parliament informed the Home Office about reports of physical abuse against inmates, which the Home Office dismissed and denied. A 17-year-old was hospitalised for five weeks with abdominal and groin pain soon after arriving in Medomsley. He described having been punched and \\"kicked, hit and struck with various objects\\" by \\"vicious\\", \\"kick and thump happy\\" officers. He compared Medomsley to \\"a prisoner of war camp\\". Another 17-year-old described other prisoners trying to break their own limbs in an attempts to be hospitalised and therefore leave Medomsley. He reported that his own chest was beaten using a studded belt and found Medomsley to be \\"like hell\\". Other former detainees said fellow inmates were often forced to keep jumping forward while crouching down and were kicked whenever they stopped with exhaustion. One said this forced \\"bunny-hopping\\" continued during the night and \\"heard screams [...] but nobody reports it in case they get filled in\\". He also recounted being punched in the mouth and detainees becoming airborne due to being severely punched in the stomach. ===Deaths=== Some inmates with medical conditions are believed to have died as a direct result of the actions of prison guards. David Caldwell At 17, David Caldwell died of an asthma attack in 1982 after being left unattended for two hours in Medomsley's hospital wing. His mother told his inquest that despite his chronic asthma, he was forced into severe physical training. His sister added \\"the bruises on his legs were caused by him being kicked around by prison officers\\" and said he and others were routinely hit in the face for not saying \\"sir\\". In 2014, she called for the case to be reopened and fully investigated. She felt the inquest, which attributed Caldwell's death to natural causes, \\"was a waste of time\\" because \\"they weren't interested\\" and \\"weren't listening\\" to her information. She said \\"I have got asthma, too, and I know if you get agitated it can bring it on ‚Äì and he had asthma worse than me. I believe the attack was brought on by his ill-treatment.\\" Ian Shackleton Ian Shackleton, who had diabetes, fell into a coma and died in 1981 after being denied insulin. ===David Alan Brown=== David Alan Brown was physically abused and prevented from attending his grandmother's funeral during his three months in Medomsley in 1981 for a crime he didn't commit. At 17, he was \\"beaten up everyday\\" by Christopher Onslow, who repeatedly kicked him while forcing him to run without footwear, for being unable to run four miles within 35 minutes. Other detainees asked Brown to jump on and break their own legs so that they could avoid this brutal physical training under Onslow. Brown and others were beaten for not addressing officers as \\"sir\\". Officer John McGee punched Brown in the mouth for complaining about not being allowed to attend his grandmother's funeral. Brown believes the physical abuse was sadistic and knew that others were being sexually assaulted. He said officers targeted smaller weaker inmates. He was initially too afraid to report the abuse, expecting to be disbelieved, and eventually found the courage after he saw a BBC documentary about Operation Seabrook. However, all records of his imprisonment in Medomsley had been destroyed, making him feel like he \\"was going crazy\\" and leaving him to search for and rely on a detailed diary by his father, which had almost been dumped, as evidence. Brown said even after decades, \\"I do think about it everyday\\" and \\"the memories will never go out of my brain\\". ===Doug Corkhill=== Doug Corkhill was sent to Medomsley for six months in 1978. He suffered recurring sexual assaults by Neville Husband each week and was physically abused and humiliated by other officers. As soon as he entered Medomsley, officers strip searched him and others and struck Corkhill's head for not saying \\"sir\\" when Corkhill informed an officer he wore spectacles. Another time, an officer humiliated him by pulling him by the hair from a toilet cubicle with his underwear down in front of other inmates, some of whom laughed at him, while the officer was beating him, reducing him to tears. He was haunted for life by memories of other inmates being violently attacked by staff, such as inmates' heads being pelted with crates for cheering to sports results on the radio and an exhausted young inmate screaming and crying out for his mother while being beaten and kicked by Christopher Onslow for being unable to continue running a four-mile \\"fence run\\" in 35 minutes. ===Ian Farrer=== At 17, Ian Farrer was physically abused and humiliated in Medomsley in 1987 and reported this to police in 2014. He experienced physical abuse daily and recalled being knocked to the ground with \\"a massive blow to my kidneys\\", then hit on the head by a prison guard for having a loose buckle. Farrer recalled other inmates intentionally having their own legs broken in order to avoid the violent attacks they might otherwise face. Prison guards routinely woke inmates during the night with loud noises and forced them to \\"do bunnyhops all around the place\\". He had been sent to Medomsley for four months for handling stolen property. ===Rod Jones=== Rod Jones \\"never got over\\" abuse in Medomsley, even after 50 years. Aged 17, he was locked inside a laundry basket and rolled a quarter of a mile. A hose was inserted and he said \\"I could feel myself drowning. It was like water-boarding. I lost consciousness and the next thing I knew I was tipped out onto the floor of my cell.\\" He was subjected to \\"beating after beating\\" and, desperate to escape, confessed to over a hundred crimes he had never committed. Officers also gave him a rope, telling him to hang himself or \\"they would do it for me\\". ===John McCabe=== During John McCabe's six months in Medomsley, Neville Husband raped the 17-year-old nearly every night. The abuse began the day he started his job in the kitchen, with Husband grabbing him, creepily pressing himself against him and later intimidating him with a knife. The rapes began the next day. Husband sometimes took McCabe outside of Medomsley, where a second man raped him, watched by a woman. The second man was never prosecuted. McCabe believed he would die in Medomsley and was told by Husband \\"I could kill you and put you in one of these boxes and bury you and nobody would know.\\" He sought an enquiry, together with his local MP for East Kilbride, Michael McCann, who wrote \\"a formal request\\" for a full inquiry to Justice Secretary Ken Clarke. McCann attributed Operation Seabrook's launch to McCabe's \\"bravery and his ability to speak out about it, and giving up his anonymity\\", which resulted in McCann \\"raising the matter at Prime Minister‚Äôs Questions\\" and \\"finally convinced County Durham Police Force to open up the investigation.\\" Operation Seabrook's lead investigator Detective Superintendent Paul Goundry praised \\"Mr McCabe‚Äôs courage in allowing himself to be named\\" and said McCabe \\"motivated not only myself, but also my team, to bring others to justice.\\" ===Ray Poar=== At 17, Ray Poar was incarcerated in Medomsley for stealing biscuits. Upon his arrival, he was immediately ordered to help in the kitchen, where Neville Husband violently assaulted him. Poar said \\"When I said ‚Äòno‚Äô, he started squeezing my neck as hard as he could. He just kept squeezing and squeezing until I was passing out and I thought I was going to die. He was saying in my ear, ‚ÄòYou could disappear from here, nobody would care and nobody would know‚Äô. It was absolutely terrifying.\\" Poar passed out and when he regained consciousness, he was being raped. He was too frightened to tell anyone. He was raped again the following day and said \\"from then on it just got worse\\". Being raped by Husband \\"became part of the routine of the day\\". He didn't resist because he \\"didn't want to die\\". He believes other prison guards knew about the abuse and chose not to stop it and said \\"We knew we couldn't turn around to them and complain to them about what had happened with Husband because they were part of it, they were the ones that were kicking us about every day. ... You had nobody to talk to.\\" Tim Newell, Medomsley's governor from 1978 to 1981, said \\"If staff knew about the abuse taking place I am very concerned they let the abuse continue.\\" Poar was humiliated by being awoken and made to run to the showers \\"bunny-hopping\\" while naked and being kicked. In the years following his incarceration in Medomsley, Poar suffered a nervous breakdown and almost jumped into a swollen river in a suicide attempt. He had \\"thought everyone was a paedophile\\" and, on becoming a father, struggled with an overwhelming terror of his own children being raped. A year after the birth of his son, he was unable to work properly, drinking heavily, sinking into debt and suicidal. He only survived thanks to support from a friend and from his wife. He reported the abuse to police after Husband's initial conviction in 2003. Poar remained affected by Medomsley ever since Husband's abuse, saying after 40 years, \\"from the moment I wake up I'm thinking about Medomsley until the minute I go to bed\\" and \\"it's ruined my life, it's completely ruined it.\\" ===Eric Sampson=== Eric Sampson, who was abused in Medomsley when he was 17, said it was \\"a hellhole\\", \\"worse than a concentration camp\\", \\"run on violence, every day, morning, afternoon and night\\" and \\"the most shocking, horrible place I've ever been in my life\\". He had been prevented from disclosing the abuse by threats of death. ===Barry Segar=== Barry Segar, who was incarcerated in Medomsley when he was a boy, revealed in 2019 that he still suffers \\"nightmares\\" and is still too afraid to leave his home because \\"going places\\" causes recurring \\"flashbacks ... my body shakes\\". He was attending counselling. ===Tony Skillen=== At 16, Tony Skillen was hospitalised because his skull was broken in a severe beating by Christopher Onslow. The officer Brian Johnson Greenwell forced Skillen to pretend in hospital that the injury Onslow inflicted was caused by an accidental fall. The experience caused Skillen 40 years of \\"awful mental health problems\\" and was \\"still a nightmare to look back on\\". He said Medomsley was \\"like a concentration camp\\" where \\"the daily routine was just violence\\" that \\"never stopped\\" because \\"if you weren't getting it, someone else was\\". In Medomsley, Skillen feared for his life. ===Dave Stoker=== Dave Stoker, a victim of Neville Husband, was too \\"frightened to tell anyone\\" because Husband told him \\"he would make my life hell\\" if the sexual abuse became known. This left Stoker feeling \\"so disgusted\\", \\"dirty\\" and \\"ashamed\\", pushing him to alcoholism. He died of cirrhosis of the liver. ===Peter Toole=== Peter Toole's head was banged against a wall when he arrived in Medomsley in 1985. He was there for handling stolen goods. He said \\"they tried to break you\\" and \\"the place was run on violence\\". ===Kevin Young=== At 17, Kevin Young, who spent his childhood in care, was incarcerated in Medomsley in 1977 for possessing a ¬£12 stolen watch that his brother gave him. Neville Husband began sexually abusing him almost immediately and it soon escalated. \\"Within days what started as light touching and pressing himself against me very quickly escalated into situations where he was forcing me to go upstairs to a store room area. He would lock me in the store room area and uninterrupted would carry out what I've always described as torture.\\" Husband tied him up, blindfolded him and raped him nearly every day. Some days, Young was gang-raped at Husband's home. Husband responded with death threats to Young's pleas for him to stop. Young was repeatedly \\"told I could be found hanging in my cell\\", which he believed because \\"that year two boys had been found hanging in their cell. I was in fear of my life.\\" The day he was released, Young tried to report the abuse to police, showing an officer strangulation marks on his neck, who replied that making such a report against a prison officer was itself a criminal offence. \\\\- Officers at Consett police station silenced Young by threatening to return him to Medomsley and ignored his complaint. ==Perpetrators== Seven former officers were jailed for abusing Medomsley inmates, including two for sexual abuse. Police suspected the two belonged to a larger child sex abuse ring. Six more former Medomsley officers were warned they could face charges if further evidence against them emerges. The Crown Prosecution Service explained that other abusive Medomsley officers were either dead or were too difficult to identify. The Ministry of Justice stated after convictions in March 2019, \\"It is right that those responsible for such appalling behaviour are finally being brought to justice and we hope never to see abuse on this scale ever again.\\" {  !Perpetrator !Conviction(s) !Sentence - Neville Husband (\\"The Chef\\") Indecent assault (10 counts), buggery 10 years - Leslie Johnson Sexual offences 6 years - Christopher Onslow (\\"The Machine\\") \\"Grievous bodily harm\\" (GBH), wounding to inflict GBH, \\"misconduct in public office\\" (two counts), \\"actual bodily harm\\" (three counts). 8¬Ω years - Kevin Blakely (\\"Broken Nose\\") Misconduct in public office 2 years and nine months - John McGee (\\"Pigeon Man\\") Assault, misconduct in public office 2 years and eight months - Brian Johnson Greenwell (\\"Puppet\\") Misconduct in public office 2¬Ω years - Alan Bramley (\\"Bong Eye\\") Misconduct in public office 1¬Ω years } Because of Operation Halter, two former Medomsley officers were jailed for sexual offences against inmates. Serial rapist Neville Husband was convicted and jailed in 2003, followed by Leslie Johnson in 2005. Their sentences totalled 16 years. Under Operation Seabrook, five more officers ‚Äî Onslow, McGee, Bramley and Blakely ‚Äî were convicted in late 2018 and early 2019 of physically abusing inmates and received prison sentences totalling nearly 18 years. Judge Howard Crowson said officers frequently punched and stamped on inmates, which went beyond what legally permissible even in those days and amounted to criminal misconduct. Operation Seabrook's leader Detective Adrian Green said Medomsley officers \\"abused their position\\", inflicting \\"immeasurable suffering and lifelong damage\\". He said more abusers remain at large and that he \\"would be looking to prosecute\\" those who covered it up. ===Neville Husband=== Neville Husband, the chef and later a church cleric, raped boys at Medomsley every day for 15 years and silenced his victims by threatening to kill them. He received two prison sentences in 2003, totalling 10 years. The first was for eight years in February 2003 for indecent assault (10 counts) and buggery, against five boys. When sentenced, he was expressionless and his victims were visibly relieved. The second was for two years in September 2003 for sexually abusing another four young victims. Judge Esmond Faulks told Husband \\"You and others like you helped cause their damaged personalities. Up until now, they never thought anyone would believe them.\\" He worked in prisons for 27 years, 17 of which were in Medomsley where he ran the kitchens, beginning in 1970. His sentences in 2003 were for sexual abuse he perpetrated there from 1974 to 1984. Husband was investigated under Operation Halter. Its leader, Northumbria Police's Detective Inspector Simon Orton explained in 2003 \\"There could be a lot more [victims of Neville Husband], but I would anticipate there are people who have put it behind them and would simply want to leave it that way. We will have to respect that.\\" Detective Orton said: \\"It is clear that this man forced himself on the young men in his charge. I can only surmise how many other people have been through his clutches. I think the sentence was entirely appropriate and reflected the abhorrent nature of the breach of trust he perpetrated all those years ago.\\" Prison service director Sir Martin Narey apologised to Husband's victims \\"without reservation\\", saying \\"we should have stopped him much earlier.\\" Husband's victims were 16 to 19-year-old inmates who he chose to work with him in the kitchen. Sometimes he \\"blatantly\\" sexually assaulted them there and sometimes he brought them elsewhere and secretly abused them. He hid alcohol in the kitchen and used a kitchen store room as a bedroom with sexual paraphernalia where he forced a boy to sleep each night. He prohibited staff from searching the kitchen area. Lead investigator Detective Paul Goundry said any detainee who worked for Husband in the kitchen \\"would almost certainly be raped or sexually abused\\". Husband targeted boys who spent time in care and were unlikely to have family support. One victim, Kevin Young, described him as \\"one of the most power crazed men I have come across and I have met some violent people\\". Husband tied up and blindfolded Young, ordered him to strip naked and took pornographic photographs of him. A victim described being assaulted by Husband every day, with Husband apologising each time and promising not to do it again. The victim said \\"The more I complained, the worse it got\\" and during each attack, he pleaded with Husband to stop. Husband responded by promising not to do it again and threatening that the boy \\"could be found hung in a cell\\" if he dared tell anyone. Husband also overpowered a victim by threatening him with a knife. In 2007, the Crown Prosecution Service refused to prosecute Husband for abusing a boy in Deerbolt youth offenders' institution, saying charges would be \\"not in the public interest\\". While working in Medomsley in 1985, Husband was caught with pornography and sex toys in his locker and moved to Frankland prison, facing no further action. He had also been investigated for smuggling pornography into prison a decade before starting in Medomsley and was arrested in 1969 for possessing pornographic images of teenage boys, while working in Portland Borstal, Dorset. He faced no action after claiming these pornographic images were research for a book. The images included photographs of boys in Portland Borstal and sado-masochistic images of boys. Husband was married with one child. After he finished working in prisons, he became a minister at the United Reformed Church and ran two churches. He kept thousands of child pornography images on computers in his home and church office along with sex aids and sexually explicit novels and videos. His release from prison in 2009 alarmed victims. When he died in August 2010, victims expressed relief, with one saying he \\"would always have been a risk as long as he was alive.\\" By March 2019, there were around 300 allegations against Husband, which Durham Constabulary expected to become \\"considerably higher\\". ===Leslie Johnson=== Leslie Johnson's jail sentence in 2005 was six years for sexually abusing Medomsley inmates. He also received a suspended sentence of nine months in 1990 for sexually assaulting a boy in Medomsley and a second boy elsewhere. Johnson was previously arrested at Medomsley in 1985. He worked in Medomsley as a \\"storeman\\". Johnson told a trial Neville Husband had \\"given a boy\\" to him. Johnson died following his release from prison. ===Christopher Onslow=== Christopher Onslow (nicknamed \\"The Machine\\") was jailed in 2019 for eight-and-a-half-years for \\"grievous bodily harm\\" (GBH), wounding to inflict GBH, \\"misconduct in public office\\" (two counts, both relating to physical abuse) and \\"actual bodily harm\\" (three counts). He submitted an appeal against this conviction. One victim, David Alan Brown, said \\"it should have been 18 and a half years for Onslow\\". His conviction for grievous bodily harm was for knocking an inmate from a height of 20 feet, breaking his back. When this overweight inmate became stuck on an obstacle course net, Onslow and a second officer pelted him with rocks and bricks, causing him to fall backwards 20 feet to the ground, crushing three vertebrae. When the injured inmate screamed, Onslow shouted \\"Shut up you soft bastard, there's nothing wrong with you.\\" An officer forced him to get up and walk in extreme agony to the medical room. His injuries were so severe that he spent weeks in a body cast. Onslow's conviction for wounding was because he whacked a teenage inmate in the face with a boot, breaking his nose. and causing lasting scars, walloped his head again, tearing his ear, then pelted him with heavy medicine balls. The victim said it \\"was the most violent experience of my life and I thought I was going to die that day\\", describing Medomsley as \\"an absolute hell hole\\" and \\"torture\\". Onslow organised physical training for inmates from 1975 to 1985 and frequently assaulted inmates in the gym. Onslow assaulted a prisoner who told him \\"there's something amiss with Mr Husband\\" after being raped by Neville Husband, and ordered the prisoner never to disclose the rape to anyone. Onslow kicked and stamped on a 17-year-old, then pelted him with medicine balls, breaking his ankle. Onslow and other officers tormented a mixed race detainee with an onslaught of racist abuse. Onslow beat a boy on the head using a shoe, for not reaching the showers fast enough. While he was desperately fleeing, the boy collided with a concrete post and lost consciousness, causing migraines that continued for decades. Onslow beat up another inmate for picking a team of inmates that won a game of football against a staff team and violently attacked a 17-year-old who lost a 200-metre race because this lost him a ¬£10 bet. \\\\- He was described by David Alan Brow as an \\"animal\\" that \\"loved every minute\\" of being \\"aggressive and very violent\\" and by another as the \\"most feared officer\\". ===Kevin Blakely=== Kevin Blakely (nicknamed \\"Broken Nose\\") was jailed in 2019 for two years and nine months for misconduct (two counts). The misconduct was that he physically assaulted and abused detainees. He punched a boy for reporting sexual abuse to him and kicked a detainee who was in bed. When he was convicted on 12 March 2019, Blakely was allowed bail until sentencing on 4 April. Judge Howard Crowson said Blakely participated in a \\"culturally brutal regime\\". He was a Medomsley officer from 1974 to 1983. ===John McGee=== John McGee (nicknamed \\"Pigeon Man\\" and \\"Big John\\") was jailed in 2019 for two years and eight months. He was convicted of \\"actual bodily harm\\" and of misconduct. He submitted an appeal against these convictions. He was acquitted of sexual offences. He punched a much smaller teenager's face and burst his nose, causing a shock so severe that he soiled himself. McGee forced the teenager to bunny hop along a corridor to a shower. He was described by David Brown as \\"horrible\\", \\"a big bloke\\" and \\"always beating you\\". Brown was punched in the mouth by McGee for complaining about not being allowed to attend his grandmother's funeral. He was an officer at Medomsley from 1975 to 1982. ===Brian Johnson Greenwell=== Brian Johnson Greenwell (nicknamed \\"Puppet\\") was jailed in 2019 for two-and-a-half years. A jury found him guilty of misconduct and not guilty of a sexual offence. He remained expressionless while he was being sentenced. He dragged an inmate from the toilets who was half naked, for not being fast enough when preparing food. He was a chef and a \\"discipline officer\\" in Medomsley from 1973 to 1988. ===Alan Bramley=== Alan Bramley (nicknamed \\"Bong Eye\\") received a one-and-a-half year prison sentence in 2019 for misconduct in public office. He punched a detainee for supporting the Sunderland football team. When he was convicted on 12 March 2019, Bramley was released on bail until his sentencing in April. He was a Medomsley officer from 1973 to 1977. ==Calls for an inquiry== From around 2002, Kevin Young and other victims have called for abuse in Medomsley to be investigated by a full public inquiry. When Operation Seabrook began in 2013, he said \\"Nobody listened to [our calls for an inquiry]. I hope the police do the job now.\\" In 2014, North West Durham's MP, Pat Glass, sought a parliamentary inquiry into historical abuse of young detainees. She \\"approached the chairman of the Home Affairs select committee Keith Vaz\\" and asked the committee to examine \\"the whole issue of historic abuse in places like Medomsley\\", which she said had \\"a systematic reign of terror\\". In 2019, legal experts also sought a full open inquiry because they believe some instances of abuse in Medomsley were severe enough to have violated Article 3 of the Human Rights Act, which prohibits \\"torture\\" and \\"inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\\" They said the authorities' failure to stop the abuse was another cogent reason for an inquiry. Jonny Hall, a solicitor in the Student Law Office in Northumbria University, said not holding one \\"shows lack of respect for the human rights of vulnerable people and fails to uphold the rule of law.\\" He said a public inquiry is needed \\"to get to the heart of how it was that they could perpetrate such violence against the inmates for such a long period of time\\". The law firm Ben Hoare Bell wrote to Home Secretary Sajid Javid with a 16-page letter seeking a public inquiry into Medomsley abuse. The firm's Andrew Freckleton said \\"Medomsley was an institution in which physical and sexual abuse were commonplace. Those convicted were the tip of the iceberg.\\" In April 2019, the law firm Ben Hoare Bell also asked the chairperson of the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse to review the limit on its scope that restricted this inquiry to sexual abuse of children. Jonny Hall, from the Student Law Office in Northumbria University said this limit on its terms of reference makes the inquiry \\"unable to inquire in detail into well over 1,000 survivor accounts of sexual abuse in Medomsley for those over the age of 18 and physical abuse for any child or young person in Medomsley\\". In May 2019, the MP Laura Pidcock joined the call by asking Prime Minister Theresa May during prime minister's questions, \\"Many of the victims are not covered by the inquiry into child sexual abuse because of their age. We need to know what happened at Medomsley, we need justice for survivors and we need to make sure it never happens again. Will the Prime Minister please say we can have an independent public inquiry into the abuse at Medomsley Detention Centre?\\". The prime minister was surprised that these Medomsley victims \\"weren't able to be covered by that inquiry\\" and said \\"I will certainly look at that issue.\\" \\\\- ==See also== * Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse == References External links== * Medomsley officers guilty & jailed ‚Äì The UK Database * Medomsley detention centre ‚Äì County Durham ‚Äì The UK Database Category:Child sexual abuse in the United Kingdom Category:Child abuse incidents and cases Category:Child pornography Category:Child sexual abuse in England Category:Rape in England Category:Rape trials Category:Sex crime trials Category:Sex crimes in the United Kingdom Category:Sexual abuse cover-ups Category:British people convicted of child sexual abuse Category:Sex crimes in England Category:Sex gangs Category:1970s crimes in the United Kingdom Category:1980s crimes in the United Kingdom Category:Incidents of violence against boys Category:Crime in County Durham Category:Pedophilia Category:Human rights abuses Category:Organized crime activity Category:2003 in England Category:2019 in England Category:Violence against children Category:Violence against men in the United Kingdom ","title":"Medomsley Detention Centre"},{"id":"61332793","text":"Joy Ebinemiere Bokiri (born December 29, 1998) is a Nigerian international women's football midfielder , who is currently playing in the Turkish Women's First Football League for Konak Belediyespor in Izmir with jersey number 12. ==Playing careerClub=== Bokiri was a member of Bayelsa Queens in the Nigeria Women Premier League.

He was the youngest of eight children born to Mr. and Mrs. Andrew O'Connor of Crookston, County Cork, Ireland. He graduated from the Mechanical Arts High School in 1907 and served in the United States Army during World War I. ==Boxing== O'Connor became interested in boxing during his time in the Army. He made his professional debut as a referee for Frank Ducey, the matchmaker for the Casino Athletic Club of Lynn, Massachusetts. In 1920 he refereed the first ever bout regulated by the Massachusetts Boxing Commission - a fight between welterweights Nate Siegal and Paddy Flynn. On December 21, 1920, O'Connor refereed a bout between Harry Greb and Bob Roper. During the six round, Greb hit O'Connor in the mouth, which caused him to bleed profusely. O'Connor grabbed Greb around the waist and planted him on his stool. Greb eventually won the 10 round fight by decision. In 1922 O'Connor officiated a bout between light-heavyweight champion Gene Tunney and Chuck Wiggins at Mechanics Hall. In 1924, Lawrence J. Sweeney of The Boston Globe questioned O'Connor's decision to declare Quntion Romero-Rojas victorious over Jack Renault. Sweeney felt that O'Connor had penalized Renault for \\"carrying\\" Romero-Rojas. The following year, O'Connor refereed a bout in which Jack Sharkey was given a 2 to 1 decision over George Cook. Sweeney wrote that Cook was entitled to the victory and that the officials who gave Sharkey the victory \\"have outlived their usefulness\\". He proclaimed that the decision would \\"just about ruin the sport in the Bay State\\". On February 7, 1927, O'Connor disqualified Al Mello in the first round of his fight with George Kid Lee. It was one of Mello's four career disqualifications for low punches and one of Lee's three victories over Mello. On April 2, 1928, O'Connor declared Roberto Roberti victorious over Ted Sandwina as a result of a foul in the third round of their fight at Mechanics' Hall. The Massachusetts Boxing Commission suspended Sandwina for three months for the foul. On May 17, 1929, O'Connor disqualified Jim Maloney for hitting his opponent, Riccardo Bertazzolo, after the bell. On December 13, 1929, O'Connor stopped a fight between welterweight champion Jackie Fields and Gorilla Jones in the seventh round. O'Connor believed that both men were performing below their usual standards and declared the fight a no contest. On November 10, 1931, O'Connor declared a fight between Joe Sekyra and Paul Swiderski a no contest early in the eight round. David F. Egan of The Boston Globe described the fight as a \\"farcical exhibition\\" where the fighters \\"meant no harm to each other\\" Egan praised O'Connor for exercising \\"excellent self- restraint in allowing them to meander as long as they did\\". O'Connor warned both fighters four times before ending the bout. On September 17, 1937, O'Connor refereed a bout between the undefeated Ralph Zannelli of Providence, Rhode Island and Peter Jackson of Los Angeles. Although nonpartisan scoring favored Jackson, the fight was ruled to be a no-contest in what was seen as a \\"home-town decision\\". O'Connor favored Jackson while Judges Jim Shaughnessy and Eddie Curley voted for a split verdict. Other notable bouts officiated by O'Connor include Joe Tiplitz vs. Johnnie Downs, Tommy Gibbons vs. Pat McCarthy, Hambone Kelly vs. George Robinson, Jack Britton vs. Frankie Schoell, Sully Montgomery vs. Battling McCreary, Red Chapman vs. Johnny Dundee, George Cook vs. Bob Lawson, Tommy Loughran vs. Johnny Risko, Young Stribling vs. Maxie Rosenbloom, Tiger Flowers vs. Eddie Huffman, Al Mello vs. Johnny Mendelsohn, Jack Delaney vs. Jack Humbeck, Ernie Schaaf vs. \\"Big Boy\\" Peterson, Jim Maloney vs. Tom Heeney, Johnny Indrisano vs. Vince Dundee, Johnny Indrisano vs. Lou Brouillard, Lou Brouillard vs. Sammy Slaughter, Lou Brouillard vs. Tony Shucco, Jack Sharkey vs. Phil Brubaker, and Tiger Jack Fox vs. Lou Brouillard. ==Government== In 1911, O'Connor joined the survey and design section of the Boston public works department's highway division as a rodman. In 1929 he was promoted to junior civil engineer and transferred to the new Boston traffic commission. He was made chief traffic engineer in 1954 and promoted to traffic commissioner in 1957. In 1959 he was named fire commissioner. He retired on January 1, 1960. O'Connor died on October 31, 1961 at St. Elizabeth's Hospital. Mayor John F. Collins ordered all municipal flags at half-staff in respect for O'Connor. ==References== Category:1892 births Category:1961 deaths Category:American army personnel of World War I Category:American boxing referees Category:Commissioners of the Boston Fire Department Category:People from Charlestown, Boston Category:People from West Roxbury, Boston ","title":"Joe O'Connor (referee)"},{"id":"61333090","text":"Hafiz Assamuddin is a Pakistani politician who is member-elect of the Provincial Assembly of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. ==Political career== Assamuddin contested 2019 Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provincial election on 20 July 2019 from constituency PK-113 (South Waziristan-I) on the ticket of Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F).

On July 23, 1919, Taylor told him that he didn't have any more work for Gorman and he allegedly hit him over his head, fatally wounding him. Gorman was quickly apprehended by Chief of Police Clark.

The police were called out en masse to prevent the mob from storming the building. ==Aftermath== This uprising was one of several incidents of civil unrest that began in the so- called American Red Summer, of 1919. The Summer consisted of terrorist attacks on black communities, and white oppression in over three dozen cities and counties. In most cases, white mobs attacked African American neighborhoods. In some cases, black community groups resisted the attacks, especially in Chicago and Washington, D.C.. Most deaths occurred in rural areas during events like the Elaine Race Riot in Arkansas, where an estimated 100 to 240 black people and 5 white people were killed. Also occurring in 1919 were the Chicago Race Riot and Washington D.C. race riot which killed 38 and 39 people respectively, and with both having many more non-fatal injuries and extensive property damage reaching up into the millions of dollars. ==See also== *Washington race riot of 1919 *Mass racial violence in the United States *List of incidents of civil unrest in the United States ==Bibliography== Notes References * * * Alt URL * * * \\\\- Total pages: 234 Category:1919 in Pennsylvania Category:1919 in military history Category:1919 riots in the United States Category:July 1919 events Category:African-American history between emancipation and the civil rights movement Category:History of racism in Pennsylvania Category:History of the United States (1918‚Äì1945) Category:Racially motivated violence against African Americans Category:Riots and civil disorder in Pennsylvania Category:White American riots in the United States Category:Lynching attempts ","title":"Darby 1919 lynching attempt"},{"id":"61333143","text":"Tateikome was a town of ancient Lydia, inhabited during Roman times.

Pour le M√©rite propagates the \\"stab legend\\", which consigns the German military defeat in World War I to an alleged treason in the homeland. At the same time, Ritter also glorifies the former fighter pilots as heroes of National Socialism.Paris 1995, p. 44. ==Plot== In 1918, German pilot Lieutenant Fabian (Albert Hehn), along with his fianc√©e Gerda (Carsta L√∂ck) learn that he has been awarded the Order of Pour le M√©rite (\\"The Blue Max\\"), Germany's highest award for valor. The next morning, Fabian and Jagdgeschwader 1 (the \\"Flying Circus\\" of Manfred von Richthofen) is ordered back to the front. On the Western Front, Fabian and other officers of the squadron continue the aerial fight. Their commanding officer, Captain Prank (Paul Hartmann) returns from homeland with the news that a revolution has broken out in Germany. Prank and his men fly their aircraft back to Germany, but the squadron becomes involved in disputes with the local workers and soldiers. With the squadron's aircraft destroyed, the pilots and crew surrender, with only Moebius (Fritz Kampers) seemingly disappearing. Postwar, the former officers successfully find work in civilian occupations, but, Prank cannot cope. Moebius suddenly reappears and takes Prank and his wife Isabel to his estate, where Moebius has hidden his former warplane. He plans to start a flying school, but, a communist group attacks, and his aircraft is destroyed. During the attack, Isabel is killed. Prank is arrested, and when Moebius fails in a rescue attempt, an embittered Prank serves out his sentence and then goes abroad. After 1933, a wave of National Socialism flows in Germany with the Nazi regime attracting the discontented former officers of Jagdgeschwader 1, all holders of the coveted Pour le M√©rite award. They have continued to keep in touch and developed a strong camaraderie. At one point, the men take to the streets to fight against communists, and are arrested. In 1935, Nazi Germany restores a new Luftwaffe and invites former officers to come back. Fabian, Gerdes (Herbert A.E. B√∂hme) and Moebius, convince Prank to come back to Germany, where the latter gets appointed as the commanding officer of a new fighter squadron. Reichsmarschall Hermann G√∂ring, a former commander of Jagdgeschwader 1, visits the squadron as it equips with the new Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighter aircraft. ==Cast== * Paul Hartmann as Captain Prank * Herbert A.E.

Today, the evaluation rights are held by the Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau Foundation, which sanctions the screening of the film only in the context of special educational events.Leiser 1976, p. 45. ==Reception== Aviation film historian Bertil Skogsberg in Wings on the Screen: A Pictorial History of Air Movies (1987) characterized Pour le M√©rite as \\"... notwithstanding its palpably Nazi undertones, can be regarded as a technically good film about flying.\\" Further, he stated, \\"The film was permeated with patriotic fervor and, in spite of the glorification of the Nazi cause, it compelled the spectator's attention. Paul Hartmann was magnificent as the squadron leader, and he received much assistance from the other \\"flyers\\", Albert Hehn, Fritz Kampers and Herbert A.E.

After graduation, he taught at the university before enrolling at Yale University for his masters in 1953, studying under Josef Albers. While at Yale, he focused on how professors' exercised were received, sequenced and critiqued. After graduation, Kelly returned to MCAD where he developed the graphic design program. He later taught graphic design programs at Carnegie Mellon University, Kansas City Art Institute, Rochester Institute of Technology, and Arizona State University. He broke his education curriculum into three areas inspired by Albers' teaching: history, technical knowledge, and understanding. These areas of learning were taught so as to build upon each other to create a complete education of design through basic principles, sequence, criteria, and repetition. Kelly amassed a large collection of American wood type, a type of moveable type designed for advertising, and specimen books purchased from printers. In 1969, he published American Wood Type, 1828-1900, which was one of the first books to explore wood type in vernacular printing. While rare, Kelly allowed students to use and design with the type to learn design history. In 1966, Kelly sold the collection to the Museum of Modern Art. The collection was in turn sold to the University of Texas at Austin for storage.

According to his mother, Adriana Parada, the police began to shoot and hit the protesters without warning; she went to help her other son, aged 14, who had been hit in the head when the police then pounced on Rufo, one shooting him while another attacked him after he fell to the ground. Parada has reported to the news that her son \\"lost his eyes because he wanted to help me get back the gas that we need so much\\" and that now \\"he wants to die, for me they've ruined his life\\". Chac√≥n underwent surgery; he received 52 rubber buckshot pellets to the face, of which eight are in the left eye socket and four in the right. Primary medical reports state that his appearance has been left disfigured by the injuries. The doctor Luis Ram√≠rez, head of the San Crist√≥bal hospital, stated that Chac√≥n will be permanently blind, as Chac√≥n's eyes were so damaged that doctors could only remove what remained of them. He spent only four days in hospital, as doctors were concerned that the crisis-inflicted relative lack of hygiene at the facility would worsen his condition. ==Aftermath== Chac√≥n talking to reporters on 19 July, wearing sunglasses and face cream Chac√≥n, in speaking to the media, says that he is starting to forget what colors look like, but believes he will regain sight. Because there are pellet fragments lodged too far into his head to remove, Chac√≥n remains at risk for infection; the open wounds of his eye sockets also pose a large infection threat, and so he must cover his upper face in healing cream - with no gas and frequent blackouts there is no air conditioning and flies gather around his face. Parada had been living and working in nearby Colombia for six months, but returned in late June to attend Chac√≥n's high school graduation, which was to happen a week after the protest; she worries that having to care for him will mean she cannot return to work. === Investigations === The police officers Javier Blanco and Hanry Ram√≠rez were detained for the attack, and also for hitting another youth of 14 years at the protest. Though the charges are for inflicting head injuries to three young people, Chac√≥n is the one highlighted in media surrounding the trial. Parada denounced that on 12 July, when attending at court for the first hearing to begin the investigation, she learned that the detained officers had not been under the custody of the Cuerpo de Investigaciones Cient√≠ficas, Penales y Criminal√≠sticas (CICPC), nor were they under charge of Polit√°chira, the body they belonged to, but were enjoying protection and illegal free movement without court order. === Reactions === The governor of T√°chira, Laidy G√≥mez, declared that the state police were being directed to suppress the public under orders from the Minister of Interior and Justice, N√©stor Reverol, for 20 months. The director of Polit√°chira, Jes√∫s Arteaga, acknowledged that in the case of Rufo Chac√≥n there had been violations of human rights on the part of those responsible. The National Assembly deputy Karim Vera denounced that the police officer who shot the pellets at Chac√≥n's face held the position of head of the Brigade for Public Order in the police force, and had an open file for having committed a similar act in the 2017 protests. The officer seriously injured the youth Ornelly Chac√≥n, also with shots to the face and head, in a peaceful protest in the city of San Juan de Col√≥n, Ayacucho Municipality, T√°chira, who spent several days in critical condition in intensive care. Vera pressured the deputies of the Legislative Council of T√°chira State to ask the director of Polit√°chira to explain why the officer was allowed to hold his position and be in charge of controlling demonstrations, knowing of his background. The Juan Guaid√≥-appointed Venezuelan ambassador to the Organization of American States, Gustavo Tarre Brice√±o, described the case of Rufo Chac√≥n as \\"another example of an inhumane attitude and lack of consideration for respect for the human rights established in the constitution\\", assuring that an agenda is prepared for delivery to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights with the aim that representatives of the agency \\"can have access to all detention centers and places where there are cases of human rights violations in the country.\\" The family commission of the National Assembly declared that it would formally request for a UN human rights delegation in the country, to be appointed by the High Commissioner Michelle Bachelet, in order to begin a thorough investigation into the case of Chac√≥n, and his brother, Adri√°n Chac√≥n, who was also a victim of police repression. Social media users started a campaign to help Chac√≥n, where the ophthalmology clinic Barraquer in Bogot√°, Colombia, which specializes in cornea transplants, offered to help to treat Chac√≥n, as did the doctor Jeffrey Goldberg of the University of San Diego in California; and the professor of plastic surgery at the University of Pittsburgh, VIjay Gorantla, would study the possibility of performing an eye transplant. Only shortly after the protest his cause was attracting celebrity support, with Don Omar sharing photos of Chac√≥n on Instagram the same night of the attack. Despite the intentions of several people both inside and outside of Venezuela to support the family financially, Parada has indicated that she has not been contacted by any foreign clinic to propose alternatives that allow her to recover her son's vision. == References == Category:Blind people Category:Victims of police brutality Category:People from T√°chira Category:Protests in Venezuela Category:Students in Venezuela Category:Venezuelan people with disabilities ","title":"Attack of Rufo Chac√≥n"},{"id":"61333557","text":"The Lodgepole Opera House is a historic building in Lodgepole, Nebraska.

It is also the name of the adjacent street. ==Location== The west end of the Dijksgracht street starts from Oosterdokskade (street) on Oosterdokseiland. The Oosterdoksdraaibrug (bridge) takes it across the Oosterdoksdoorgang (channel) and the street runs east along the south of the dike to Kattenburgerstraat. The canal continues further east, under the Mariniersbrug (bridge) to the Wittenburgervaart, but there is not yet a public road along this part. Yet further east on Oostenburg island there is another segment of street called Dijksgracht, between the VOC quay and Conradstraat, but without addresses. ==History and location== The dike, after which the canal and street are named, was created at the end of the 19th century as protection for the Oostelijke Eilanden (Eastern Islands) against silting up from the IJ. The railway line from Amsterdam Centraal station to Utrecht and Hilversum is located on the dike body itself . The Piet Heinkade dual carriageway is on the other side of the railway embankment . There are several houseboats in the water . One of the most famous residents of Dijksgracht was singer Ramses Shaffy, who lived in one of these houseboats in the 1970s. In 2008, in the context of his 75th birthday, a tree was named after him. The beginning of the Dijksgracht, the so-called Kop Dijksgracht, contains a number of facilities including an indoor climbing wall, a restaurant, the Mediamatic cultural institution and the 'Shaffy's Garden' neighborhood vegetable garden ==Planned development== Due to its central location, many plans have been made to renew Dijksgracht. A temporary slow traffic bridge has been constructed from Dijksgracht to the Marineterrein, which was opened to the public in 2015. The bridge was opened in January 2016 and was later named Commandants Bridge. The span is part of a connection between Central Station and the Marineterrein. In 2007 there were plans to extend the Dijksgracht as a cycle and footpath east of the Mariniersbrug but that was postponed. In 2015, the plan was discussed again, Dijksgracht-west would be given a make-up and Dijksgracht-east would be provided with a cycle path as far as Oostenburgereiland. There was much opposition from the residents, mainly because of the disappearance of a lot of greenery. After various consultation rounds, the green and informal character of the street was preserved. The paving of the Dijksgracht was renewed in 2017, while a new sewer and gas pipeline for the houseboats were installed. To prevent subsidence of the road surface, drainage and a retaining wall were undertaken. The cycle route from Dijksgracht-west will be extended in 2019 to the former Stork site on Oosterburgereiland. == Afbeeldingen == File:Mariniersbrug-Amsterdam.jpgThe Mariniersbrug over the Dijksgracht File:Oosterdoksdraaibrug.jpgOosterdoksdraaibrug, with the climbing hall on the left.

It was located in Canada 200 miles north of Vancouver, British Columbia. Located 117 road miles west of Williams Lake and 200 air miles north of Vancouver, in the Chilcotin area of the Cariboo, RCAF Station Puntzi Mountain was located a mile off the highway near a small settlement known as Puntziville. While the radar station was active, civilian employees of the station lived in Puntziville. ==History== The area had first been settled by prospectors. After mining declined, cattle ranching became a livelihood for those who remained in the area. In the late 1940s, Puntzi Mountain was selected as a radar site, and a Canadian contractor was selected to build the site with U.S. government funding. Construction began in the spring of 1950 and the radar station was completed and accepted in May 1952. The site was operated by the 917th Aircraft Control & Warning Squadron of the United States Air Forceas a Ground-Control Intercept (GCI) station and became operational in July 1952. As originally configured, the station had FPS-3C, FPS-502, and FPS-6 radars. It was designated as Puntzi Mountain Air Station while operated by the USAF. A hundred USAF personnel and several RCAF members were assigned to the station. Puntzi Mountain was established as part of the Pinetree Line, a component of the North American Air Defense Command(NORAD). During its service, the radars were upgraded to FPS-7C/FPS-107, FPS-26 radars while keeping the FPS-6. On 1 November 1962, the 55th Aircraft Control & Warning Squadron of the RCAF assumed administrative duties at the station and by 1 February 1963 the entire station was operated by RCAF personnel. During 1963 the station began SAGE testing and had full SAGE capability and operations on 23 March 1964. The Puntzi Mountain station was the seventh of eleven Group II sites transferred to the RCAF. After being transferred to the RCAF, it was known as RCAF Station Puntzi Mountain. Building 2, known as Cariboo Hall housed the mess halls, Exchange Branch and library. Cariboo Hall was also home to CFPM, Puntzi Mountain's own radio station. In addition to the radio station, the station personnel enjoyed ample outdoor activities. The station had a theater, bowling alley and curling rink. An emergency airstrip was located at Puntzi Mountain for CF-100 aircraft, and also used by USAF Beaver aircraft assigned to the radar site. Later, when the RCAF operated Puntzi Mountain, an Otter was assigned to support the site. The Otter was used for medical evacuations, personnel transport, search and rescue, and other duties as directed by the station commander. The ground Search and Rescue Team from the station was assigned to assist the RCMP with recovering evidence and bodies from a July 9th 1965 crash of a Canadian Pacific Airline's DC-6. RCAF Station Puntzi Mountain ceased radar reporting on 1 October 1966. The station closed shortly after. ==Current status== The former RCAF Station Puntzi Mountain airstrip is now the Puntzi Mountain Airport. In 1970-71 most of the station was demolished by a contractor. The only remaining buildings are the former guard shack and garage. ==External links== * Radomes.org RCAF Station Puntzi Mountain * C and E Museum RCAF Station Puntzi Mountain Category:Installations of the United States Air Force in Canada Category:1952 establishments in British Columbia Category:Military installations established in 1953 Category:Radar stations of the United States Air Force Category:Buildings and structures in British Columbia Category:1966 disestablishments in British Columbia Category:Military installations closed in 1966 ","title":"RCAF Station Puntzi Mountain"},{"id":"61333657","text":"Captain Blood Returns is a 1931 British historical adventure novel by the Anglo-Italian writer Rafael Sabatini.

Often a cooler will be light, crisp, and colorful, and have less alcohol than other cocktails. A cooler is distinct from a spritzer in that a spritzer tends to be a mix of wine and sparkling water or wine and club soda, and therefore dryer than a cooler. Examples of coolers include the chuncho cooler (made with Chilean pisco, Galliano, lime juice, ginger syrup, and club soda), the strawberry cooler (made with strawberries, lemonade, lime, mint, and one's choice of Cointreau, vodka, tequila, rum, etc.); the summer mint cooler (made with bourbon whiskey, muddled mint liqueur, simple syrup, lemon juice, and lemon-lime soda), the Citr√≥nge Lime Cooler (made with lime liqueur, prosecco, sparkling water, and lime juice), the cucumber cooler (made with gin, lime juice, cucumber, and tonic water), etc. Some coolers are nominally non-alcoholic, but can easily be made alcoholic; e.g. a non-alcoholic strawberry cooler could be a candidate for the addition of alcohol since strawberries are very liquor-friendly. Lemonade tends to be a suitable candidate for the addition of vodka, and incidentally can also be used as a margarita ingredient. Margarita variants themselves are often used as coolers, e.g. through the use of watermelon ice cubes; or yellow peaches; or in the case of the La Paloma grapefruit soda; etc. A cooler that has wine as its alcoholic ingredient is a wine cooler. ==References== Category:Sweet cocktails ","title":"Cooler (cocktail)"},{"id":"61333688","text":"Luciana Masante (born 4 December 1978) is an Argentine former professional tennis player.

It was directed by Ralph W. Ince and stars Earle Williams and Anita Stewart. ==Plot== John Ballard's (Earle Williams) parents are killed in a railroad accident. In college, he meets and becomes friends with Philip Hardin (William R. Dunn), the son of the railroad owner. Philip plays poker with a gang of sharpers and a fight breaks out when he discovers he is being cheated. Red Hogan (Jack Brawn), the chief of the gang, would have killed Philip, but John rushes in and breaks a chair over his head. Red Hogan is apparently killed. No one knows who did it and Philip swears he will never reveal John's secret. After graduation, John meets Viola Ruskin (Anita Stewart) and the two fall in love. Philip has run into debt and his father (Frank Currier) threatens to cut him off if he does not marry and settle down. With the Hardin fortune in mind, Viola's mother (Julia Swayne Gordon) forces her to marry Philip. She dies a year later after giving birth to a daughter, Louise. Twenty years later, John is the District Attorney and he brings a suit against the railroad. Although Philip owns it, he has little involvement in its operation. Chester Jordon (Paul Scardon), one of the company's largest shareholders, has real control of the line and is maximizing profits by cutting maintenance and safety measures. Philip would blackmail John into silence, but Louise (Anita Stewart) discovers that John did not actually kill Red Hogan after all. Philip is indicted and goes to trial. John's case against the railroad is strong. At recess, Philip calls Louise for documents kept in his home safe. Her car breaks down on the way and she telegraphs that she will come on the train. Meanwhile, a railroad inspector discovers that the bridge her train will cross is in imminent danger of collapse. Philip races to catch the train but is too late. The bridge breaks apart and the train crashes into the water, its boiler exploding. The Juggernaut had three endings. At the premiere, John rushes to the scene and pulls Louise from the wreckage, but she is dead. Alternately, he finds her in a coma and she is taken to the hospital. After several days, she awakens and John is there to profess his love to her. When the film was released in Britain, the happy ending was retained but greatly shortened, with Louise waking up just after being dragged ashore. ==Cast== * Earle Williams - John Ballard * Anita Stewart - Viola Ruskin / Louise Hardin * William R. Dunn - Philip Hardin * Julia Swayne Gordon - Mrs. Ruskin * Eulalie Jensen - Mrs. Ballard * Frank Currier - James Hardin * Paul Scardon - Chester Jordon * Jack Brawn - Red Hogan ==Survival status== The Juggernaut was originally five reels long, but only two are known to survive today. These exist in the Yale Film Study Center archive and in private collections. The film has been reconstructed twice using production stills and title cards to replace the missing material. The 2012 reconstruction was 30 minutes long and the 2017 reconstruction 62 minutes. Both were produced by Harpodeon. The original film would have been between 60 and 80 minutes long, depending on projection speed. ==Associated media== Dorothy Donnell published a novelization of The Juggernaut in the April 1915 issue of Motion Picture Magazine == References Category:1915 films Category:1915 drama films Category:American films Category:American silent feature films Category:American black-and-white films Category:Lost American films Category:Vitagraph Studios films ","title":"The Juggernaut"},{"id":"61333733","text":"Diego Tinotenda Chikombeka (born ), professionally known as Diego Tryno is a Zimbabwean urban contemporary and hip-hop musician.

As of the Association's 2018 biennial report, ANICA had 40 member stores. ==Background== In 1934, the 73rd United States Congress passed the Indian Reorganization Act. Among other goals, the Act was intended to help Native Americans achieve a greater measure of self-governance and economic self- sufficiency than was possible under previous legislation. Included in the act was a provision for the creation of a revolving credit fund for the advancement of Native business ventures. However, an oversight in the legislation prevented Native Americans in Alaska from taking full advantage of the new law. In 1936, the Alaska Native Reorganization Act was passed, extending the Indian Reorganization Act to cover Alaskan Natives. The extreme difficulties associated with supplying remote villages in Alaska, as well as supply issues caused by World War II caused federal officials in the Bureau of Indian Affairs to conclude that a new organization was required to ensure those villages would remain well-supplied. In addition to improving economic conditions, the organization transferred responsibility for the supply programs to the Alaskan natives. ==Foundation and early operations== Louis Peters and Albert Huber led the government's efforts to create such an organization. Ultimately, the villages of White Mountain, Shaktoolik, Stebbins, Eli, and Unalakleet adopted bylaws and articles of association in 1947, formally creating the ANICA. The Association's Board of Directors had one representative from each member village. Additionally, non-member villages could make deposits with ANICA and receive services. In order to take advantage of economies of scale, a decision was made to postpone commencing operations until at least 25 villages stores had joined the co-op. This feat was achieved in 1948. By the end 1958, 37 villages stores were members of the co-op, and another 7 had made deposits with ANICA. ANICA made use of the revolving credit fund provided by the Indian Reorganization and Alaska Native Reorganization acts. In addition to supplying remote village stores, ANICA attempted to stimulate exports in native craft goods and furs. The Association bought native art and craft goods on consignment and transferred them to the Alaska Native Arts and Crafts Clearing House, another BIA sponsored organization, for re-sale. In another instance of encouraging exports, ANICA purchased whale and seal oil from natives in Point Hope, and shipped oil to Seattle for sale to soap makers. Ultimately, such exports were discontinued. A program of mining coal in the Point Hope region for re-sale to other Alaskan villages was also considered, but never implemented. ANCIA has published two periodicals. The first, ANICA Flash, was published from (probably) 1949 to 1954. In addition to carrying news about the various member stores and villages, ANICA Flash also had some economic news, and prices for various goods. ANICA News Highlights was published later, starting in March 1969 and running to December 1974. In addition to carrying news from the villages, the ANICA News Highlights also carried other news of interest to the remote villages it served, such as energy and shipping issues and economic trends. It also posted details on meetings of the ANICA board of directors, and reprinted segments from the earlier ANICA Flash newsletter. ==Modern organization== ANICA filed articles of incorporation in the State of Alaska on January 6, 1970, becoming a perpetual cooperative corporation. In 1990, the association established a scholarship fund for high school seniors in member villages. Modern efforts of ANICA focus on providing basic food stuff and goods to remote communities. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Media related to the Alaska Native Industries Cooperative Association is available on Alaska's Digital Archives.

He said to Green House Management Magazine, ‚ÄúI was an energetic young man, working night and day on both jobs and the market was good,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI built a house on the 20 acres, brought my first crop to Zelenka and bought another 40 acres down the road thinking I‚Äôd do more contract growing.‚Äù He worked with Zelenka for 11 years. He bought forty additional acres. Three months after closing on those forty acres, Zelenka discontinued their arrangement and Deppe had to move on to something else. They sold the forty acres, Liz got a job and Deppe began selling plants. Spring Meadow Nursery was born. The year was 1981. == Contributions to the woody plant industry == Since the 1980s, Deppe played a role in developing and marketing a business model for proprietary woody plants. Before that time, few plants were developed for their hardy genetics. He prioritized the hunting of woody plants with excellent genetics. He hired a horticulturist, plant breeder and plant hunter named Tim Wood to travel around the globe to find excellent plants. Jeremy Deppe, his son (General Manager of Spring Meadow) was quoted in Green House Management magazine as saying, ‚ÄúDale was instrumental in driving the push into branding as a way to differentiate from commodities,‚Äù Jeremy says. ‚ÄúBranding has provided a way for each part of the supply chain to add value and introducing new varieties has made gardening easier for consumers.‚Äù Green House Magazine interviewed Deppe on what he thought his contributions to the Woody Plant Industry entailed. He focused on how the new business plan for woody plants (shrubs, vines and trees) allowed for branding and marketing for better customer service. == Breast cancer research == Dale Deppe made Spring Meadow the vehicle to raise over one million dollars for breast cancer research to support the Breast Cancer Research Foundation and BCRF-funded investigators who have been deeply involved in every major advance in breast cancer prevention, diagnosis, treatment and survivorship. == Personal life == Dale Deppe is married to Liz Deppe and they have a son, Jeremy working in their business as the General Manager. == Horticulture awards  MNLA Grower of the Year - 1995 === Presented by the Michigan Nursery and Landscape Association (MNLA).

The Wilderness Society has designated the area as a ‚ÄúMountain Treasure‚Äù. The Seven sisters Trail, following the crest of Little Walker Mountain, offers good views of nearby Griffith Knob, the Big Bend of Walker Mountain and the Stony Fork Valley. The area is part of the Walker Mountain Cluster. ==Location and access== Wytheville, VirginiaThe area is in the Appalachian Mountains of Southwestern Virginia, east of adjoining US 52 and about 5 miles north of Wytheville, Virginia. A tunnel on Interstate 77 passes under its northeast corner. The only trail in the area is Forest Service Trail 6509, the Seven Sisters Trail, a 4.8 mile, yellow-blazed, difficult, hiking-and-mountain-bike trail that climbs from 2500 feet to 3300 feet while passing along seven knobs. Access to the area is gained from the Stony Creek Campground on the east, near the junction of US 52 and State Route 717. State Route 717, part of the Big Walker Mountain Scenic Byway, passes through the area along the east fork of Stony Creek. The Big Walker Mountain Scenic Byway can be accessed at either exit 47 or exit 52 from Interstate 77. Starting from the access at exit 47 on VA 717, points along the way include: *1.1 mile, access to Stony Fork Creek road *1.25 mile, eastern trailhead of Seven Sisters Trail, on left *1.5 mile, Astin homesite, access to Stony Fork Creek *3.8 miles, Stony Fork Campground, Stony Fork Creek, Stony Fork Nature Trail, Seven Sisters Trail *4.3 miles, junction with US 52, turn right *7.8 miles, Big Walker Lookout, and access, on right, to 4 mile road leading to Big Bend Picnic Area *12.7 miles, access road to Appalachian Trail, on left *12.8 miles, picnic table, on right *15.6 miles, end of byway at I-77, exit 52. Boundary of the Seven Sisters wildland as identified by the Wilderness Society The boundary of the wildland as determined by the Wilderness Society is shown in the adjacent map that can be expanded by selecting the icon below the map on the right. Additional roads and trails are given on National Geographic Maps 787 (Blacksburg, New River Valley, Trails Illustrated Hiking Maps, 787). A great variety of information, including topographic maps, aerial views, satellite data and weather information, is obtained by selecting the link with the wild land's coordinates in the upper right of this page. Additional foot access can be gained using old logging roads. The Appalachian Mountains were extensively timbered in the early twentieth century leaving logging roads that are becoming overgrown but still passable. Old logging roads and railroad grades can be located by consulting the historical topographic maps available from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The Seven Sisters wildarea is covered by USGS topographic maps Big Bend, Bland and Crockett. ==Natural history== The area is part of the Central Appalachian Broadleaf Coniferous Forest-Meadow Province. By providing a land bridge for a wildlife crossing, the tunnel for I-77 eliminates the impact of habitat fragmentation on wildlife that want to cross the interstate. Forest Service records indicate that there are several areas of old growth forest north of VA 717. ==Topography== The wildland is part of the Ridge and Valley Subsection of the Northern Ridge and Valley Ecosystem Section. Ridges, composed of sandstone and shale, run northeast/southwest, with parallel valleys created from limestone or shale. The area includes the watershed of upper East Fork Stony Fork between Walker Mountain on the north and Little Walker Mountain on the south. Stony Creek is a tributary of Reed Creek which flows into the New River near Wytheville. Big Bend is a 3868-foot, rugged and scenic point on Walker Mountain. ==Forest Service management== The Forest Service has conducted a survey of their lands to determine the potential for wilderness designation. Wilderness designation provides a high degree of protection from development. The areas that were found suitable are referred to as inventoried roadless areas. Later a Roadless Rule was adopted that limited road construction in these areas. The rule provided some degree of protection by reducing the negative environmental impact of road construction and thus promoting the conservation of roadless areas. Seven Sisters was not inventoried in the roadless area review, and therefore not protected from possible road construction and timber sales. The forest service classifies areas under their management by a recreational opportunity setting that informs visitors of the diverse range of opportunities available in the forest. The southern part of the area is designated ‚ÄúMaintenance/Restoration of Forest Communities‚Äù, sections near Rt. 52, I-77 and Va 727 are ‚ÄùScenic Corridor‚Äú, the slope of Walker Mountain is ‚ÄúDispersed Recreation ‚Äì Suitable\\" with small tracts of ‚ÄúOld Growth with Disturbance‚Äù. There have been proposals for wind turbines between Rt. 52 and I-77 near the area. The Forest Service has logged at least 55 acres near the Stony Fork Campground and there has been some prescribed burning. While the Stony Creek Camground remains open, some facilities have been reduced in operation. The Dark Horse Hollow picnic area on the southwest has been closed and the Big Bend picnic area has become an overlook. There has been some vandalism at the shooting range near the Stony Creek Campground, and unauthorized use of motorized vehicles beyond the gate at the Big Bend area to access Rt. 206. ==See also== *Walker Mountain Cluster *Seven Sisters Trail ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Stephenson, Steven L., A Natural History of the Central Appalachians, 2013, West Virginia University Press, West Virginia, . * Davis, Donald Edward, Where There Are Mountains, An Environmental History of the Southern Appalachians, 2000, University of Georgia Press, Athens, Georgia. . ==External links== * George Washington and Jefferson National Forest * Wilderness Society Category:George Washington and Jefferson National Forests Category:Southwest Virginia Category:Mountains of Virginia ","title":"Seven Sisters (conservation area)"},{"id":"61333999","text":"Percheron in a Landscape Stable Boy with Two Horses Jean Fran√ßois Achille Giroux (13 May 1816, Mortagne-au-PercheArchives de l'Orne Registre d'√©tat civil Mortagne-au-Perche N + T 3NUMECEC293/3E2_293_30 (1815-1818) \\\\- 26 March 1854, Saint-L√©on√âtat civil Lot et Garonne - ville de Saint-L√©on - Naissances, Mariages, D√©c√®s 1853-1862) was a French painter and lithographer in the Realist style. Most of his works feature animals; primarily horses. == Biography == His father, √âtienne Jean Giroux, was a wigmaker and his mother, Marie-Louise Maillard came from a family of bakers. After his primary education in Alen√ßon, he attended the Cavalry School in Saumur. It was there that he received his first drawing lessons, combined with some elements of lithography. Eventually, his parents allowed him to go to Paris to pursue his interests.Jean Arpentinier, Peintres et artistes du Perche 1560-1960, √âditions de la reinette, 2006 There, he became a student of Michel Martin Drolling. Although human models were presented to him, his most enthusiastically produced drawings continued to involve horses. He also became more adept at lithography; to the point that, despite his youth, a major publisher, Victor Delarue (fl.1835-1870), hired him to create illustrations for a course on equine anatomy. In pursuit of this, he would make daily visits to the √âcole nationale v√©t√©rinaire d'Alfort to study and make sketches of the dissected horses there. With the proceeds from this contract, he made a tour of France. While travelling in Normandy, he paid a visit to the Haras national du Pin, France's oldest stud farm. He would return there throughout his short life for inspiration.Revue des beaux-arts : Tribune des artistes : published under the auspices of the , 1850-1861. His first exhibition at the Salon came in 1840. By 1843, he was presenting several works at each session and was attracting customers from England as well as rural France. Nevertheless, he was not financially successful and remained in debt. His troubles truly began when creditors came to seize his belongings and took a writing desk, said to have belonged to Margaret of Parma, that had been left in his safekeeping by a neighbor who had been expecting a similar seizure. Some of his sketches were overlooked and were collected by his friend, Eug√®ne Isabey, who sold them at auction and was able to take in twenty Louis d'or to help him pay his debts. After this, Giroux went to stay at the artists' colony in Barbizon.A propos d'un portrait d'Achille Giroux, Le Figaro, Paris. 6 August 1854 That was only the beginning, however. The next time his troubles came in the form of a publisher who contracted with him for an album of equestrian scenes that required eight to ten months of work, with the promise of a 4,000 Franc advance. The advance was never paid, he received no royalties and the would-be publisher disappeared. A few months later, he learned of the publisher's bankruptcy. Not long after, he was visited by court officials who presented him with a note for 4,000 Francs, which he had supposedly initialed, and was now forced to pay, plus interest and fees, or he would be taken to prison. He sold what paintings he could, drew on charity or loans from his friends and was able to pay off the principal, but his total indebtedness eventually rose to 12,000 Francs and he was under the constant threat of imprisonment. This continual struggle exhausted him and he became unable to paint. In 1854, the writer and journalist, Alfred de Menciaux, offered him the hospitality of his home in Lot-et-Garonne. Shortly after arriving there, Giroux died. == References  External links == Category:1816 births Category:1854 deaths Category:French painters Category:Animal painters Category:People from Orne Category:French lithographers ","title":"Achille Giroux"},{"id":"61334004","text":"Astrebla lappacea, commonly known as curly Mitchell grass, is a herb of the family Poaceae from the order Poales.

The loyalist forces were turned back and decimated by rebel attacks. ==Battle== On 24 April 1965, young military officers rose in revolt in Santo Domingo. The following day, the rebel-held presidential palace was strafed by the Dominican Air Force and shelled by naval vessels. Because crowds of mostly unarmed civilians occupied the Duarte Bridge, during 26 April airplanes routinely strafed the bridge to clear a path for loyalist tanks. The air force also bombed and strafed other sites in the capital with the loss of several aircraft. About noon 27 April, the loyalists resumed their bombardment; strafing by the airplanes drove the crowds from the Duarte Bridge, and bombing shattered many of the buildings and structures to the west. Outwardly the damage west of the bridge seemed impressive with countless dead bodies lying on the streets. Sometime around 17:00 hours on 27 April, the aerial bombardment lifted and a sizeable loyalist force of tanks, artillery, and infantry began to rumble across Duarte Bridge under covering fire from 12.7 mm machine guns on the eastern bank. The rebels left two large truck trailers used to haul sugar cane blocking the path, but as the tanks pushed their way through these obstacles, one of the two pre‚ÄìWorld War I 75 mm cannon on the rebel side got off one shot and destroyed the first tank. Soon a hail of machine gun fire silenced the 75 mm cannons and the rest of the tanks proceeded into the city. When the tank column passed Jos√© Mart√≠ Street one block from Duarte Avenue, hidden machine guns opened up on the infantry, and most of the soldiers either fled or were killed. Without infantry cover, the tanks, already in the narrow streets of the neighborhood, were sitting ducks for the shower of Molotov cocktails soon raining down from the surrounding buildings. As the remnants of the loyalist infantry fled back across the Duarte Bridge to the east bank, the first tanks in the column exploded in flames. The raging fires panicked the crews of the remaining tanks and most of them abandoned their vehicles. Only a few tanks escaped and fled back across the Duarte Bridge. ==NotesReferences== * Category:Conflicts in 1965 Category:1965 in the Dominican Republic ","title":"Battle of Duarte Bridge"},{"id":"61334029","text":"Juan de Dios Rawson (1833‚Äì1902) was an Argentine military man, who took part in the Argentine Civil War, War of the Triple Alliance against Paraguay, and the Conquest of the Desert against the Aboriginal Tribes.

Commercially, the genre has been very successful, with many afroswing artists making it into the British charts. == Characteristics == Afroswing is largely defined by its melody rather than a specific tempo. Producer Steel Banglez stated the key elements of afroswing were happy or dark chords that \\"make you feel a certain way\\", and that \\"drum pattern is the most important thing about this whole sound, it's the snare that comes on the third. In hip-hop it comes on the fourth. Coming off the third beat comes from afrobeats.\\" Martin Connor, an expert in vocal melodies and rap analysis, described the characteristics of the genre as being \\"[..] technically in 4/4, what you will hear over and over again is this recurring pattern made up of three notes that are still repeated in the framework of a 4/4 time signature [..] You can hear the inspirations of Jamaican music in the rhythm except Jamaican music doesn‚Äôt have a bass kick and the snare ‚Äì that‚Äôs hip hop, that‚Äôs traditional rap. So this is that translation of cultures happening subtly in the instrumentation. Yet it still has a hip hop sensibility in terms of lyrical focus and music videos: cars, money, authenticity, hardness\\". == Origins == The rise of afroswing is in large part a result of the slow acceptance of African-derived sounds in the UK. The first genre to really embrace African influenced music and push it into the mainstream was UK funky via artists such as Donae'o, and in early-2010s, afrobeats, with artists such as Mista Silva, Kwamz, Fuse ODG, and Timbo gaining mainstream success through their afrobeats sound. Around the same time, artists such as Sneakbo and Timbo were incorporating melodic rap and Caribbean influences into their music. These artists collectively set the foundation for what would later turn into afroswing, and contributed to the rise of youth embracing their African heritage. In 2010, Sneakbo released \\"Touch Ah Button\\", an early example of the merger of dancehall and afrobeats influences. In February 2014, Timbo and Mover released \\"Ringtone\\", which DJ Kenny Allstar credited as opening \\"the door to the bridge of Afro-rap and the evolution of Afroswing, which was essentially someone laying a hook over a rap record\\". The rise of producers Jae5, Blairy Hendrix, Joshua Beatz, and rapper J Hus saw the sound begin to distinguish and cement itself. Together they fused afrobeats, bashment, and trap, along with a melodic style of rapping with gritty, hood lyrical themes derivative of Road rap. J Hus and Timbo have both received credit for pioneering the genre. Due to being a new genre, there was some confusion on what to call it initially. This has led to many people calling the genre 'afrobeats', and whilst there are some similarities, the genre is not quite the same. Likewise, simply lumping it up with \\"uk rap\\" is misleading, because while it is accurate, it disregards the uniqueness of the genre that sets it apart from other strands of UK rap. Kojo Funds has explicitly stated he is not trying to be defined as an afrobeats artist and to instead refer to his music as afroswing. Blairy Hendrix and Joshua Beatz, producers for J Hus, were in 2014 initially calling their sound \\"Traprobeats\\", denoting the various influences of afrobeats and trap music. Around the same time, Jabz Daniels was making a similar sound and called his music \\"Trapfrobeat\\". The name \\"Afroswing\\" was initially coined by rapper Kojo Funds, as well as being pushed by prominent producer Juls. The name implies the fusion of \\"afro\\", from afrobeats, with the mixture drums derived from R&B; and dancehall which the genre \\"swings\\" between using. Afroswing was eventually picked up by Apple Music as their official genre name for the sound. Spotify however, opted to go for \\"AfroBashment\\", a term coined by Austin Daboh who was hired by BBC 1Xtra, denoting its fusion of bashment and afrobeats styles. In 2014, J Hus did a popular freestyle on YouTube channel GRM Daily showcasing his distinctive style. The first notable song in the genre was released in 2015, titled \\"Dem Boy Paigon\\", quickly elevating J Hus' status and becoming a club hit, and soon after ushering in a new wave of artists making similar music. J Hus' sound was a unique blend of Ghanaian afro-pop, afrobeats, and British rap. J Hus was unique in that he would mix rapping with melodic singing, something uncommon in the scene at the time. 2014 also saw the emergence of Mostack, Tion Wayne, and Geko. Many new artists began to crop up from 2015 onwards, such as Kojo Funds, Not3s, Don EE, and ZieZie. Kojo Funds, who coined the name 'afroswing', made his break-out single \\"Dun Talkin'\\" in 2016. Lotto Boyzz, a Birmingham based group, also gained prominence and decided to call their sound 'afrobbean', denoting the fusion of African and Caribbean influences in the sound. == Success == The genre has been supported by YouTube channels such as GRM Daily, LinkUp TV, and Mixtape Madness, which has allowed artists to easily release music videos to potentially millions of listeners and propagate the genre as a result. Many afroswing artists, such as J Hus, Not3s, EO, and Ramz, have all had very successful singles in the charts, becoming mainstream acts in their own right. Ramz' single \\"Barking\\" peaked at number 2 on the UK singles chart, and sold over 500k copies. EO's song \\"German\\" peaked at number 13, and J Hus' single \\"Did You See\\" got to number 9 on the charts and became the most-streamed single of 2017. Another major artist in the genre, Kojo Funds, gained a \\"Best Song Award\\" at the MOBO Awards in 2017 for his song \\"Dun Talkin'\\" with Abra Cadabra. Mostack, Not3s, and Kojo Funds all enjoyed chart success in 2017. In 2015, a three-member group called WSTRN gained international attention via Drake's OVO Sound Radio, which had played their 2015 breakout single \\"In2\\" on Beats1. In 2017, J Hus released his album Common Sense. The album would gain critical acclaim, entering the British charts at number 10, eventually peaking at number 6 and staying on the charts for over 90 weeks. B Young released \\"Jumanji\\" in 2018. The song became a hit, selling over 600,000 copies and garnering over 40 million streams, also peaking at number 13 on the UK Singles Chart. In 2018, afroswing artists such as WSTRN, Yxng Bane, Not3s, and Hardy Caprio appeared at SXSW festival in Texas, the first time the genre had ever been represented at the festival. == Notable artists == * One Acen * B Young * EO * Hardy Caprio * J Hus * Kojo Funds * Lotto Boyzz * Mostack * Not3s * NSG * Ramz *Steel Banglez * Yxng Bane * WSTRN == See also == * Afrobeats * British hip hop * Dancehall * Grime == References == Category:Hip hop genres Category:2010s in music Category:Black British music Category:Music in London Category:Youth culture in the United Kingdom Category:British styles of music ","title":"Afroswing"},{"id":"61334123","text":"Quell and Co is a 1982 film directed by William Witney.

While there have been longer \\"friendships\\" () in Polish football, such as Polonia Warsaw and Cracovia having relations since the 1920s and officially since the 1960s, their decision to end their friendship agreement in 2017 meant that the agreement between Lechia and ≈ölƒÖsk became the longest current friendship in Polish football. The Friendship has officially been in place since 1977, with the friendship linking back to 1976. The friendship came into fruition in 1976 after ≈ölƒÖsk Wroc≈Çaw fans traveled to northern Poland to watch ≈ölƒÖsk play against Gwardia Koszalin, a team who has strong links with Arka Gdynia, the main rival of Lechia Gda≈Ñsk. During meetings between the two clubs there is no segregation between fans, as in normal football matches, with both sets of fans often being involved with displays of banners and tifo. ==TeamsLechia Gda≈Ñsk=== Founded in 1945 in Gda≈Ñsk after the expulsion of Poles in Lviv. Throughout their history they have mostly played in the top three tiers. The club had to restart in the lowest divisions after the club created a new club independent club a few years after the Lechia-Polonia Gda≈Ñsk merger in 2001. The team have been playing in the Ekstraklasa since 2008. The club have currently won the Polish Cup and the Polish SuperCup twice, winning both cups in 1983 and 2019. The team's highest position in the Ekstraklasa is third which it achieved in 1956 and 2019. ===≈ölƒÖsk Wroc≈Çaw=== Founded in 1947 in Wroc≈Çaw, ≈ölƒÖsk have been the more successful of the two teams, playing mostly in the top division since the 1960s. ≈ölƒÖsk last won promotion to the Ekstraklasa in 2008 and have been in the league since. ≈ölƒÖsk have won the Polish championship twice in 1977 and 2012, and finishing in either second or third a further six times. They have won the Polish Cup twice, the Polish SuperCup twice, and the Ekstraklasa Cup once. ==Three Kings of Great Cities== ≈ölƒÖsk fans in 2003. The \\"Trzej Kr√≥lowie Wielkich Miast\\" banner can be seen on the right The Three Kings of Great Cities alliance () was created in 1994 when Wis≈Ça Krak√≥w formed an agreement with ≈ölƒÖsk Wroc≈Çaw. Lechia and Wis≈Ça already had an agreement which dated back to 1973, with the two teams splitting from that agreement at least once. The friendship between the three teams was created to combat the large \\"The Great Triad\\" (), the alliance between Arka Gdynia, Cracovia and Lech Pozna≈Ñ. The alliance ended in 2016 with Wis≈Ça Krak√≥w intending to form a friendship with Ruch Chorz√≥w. This upset both Lechia and ≈ölƒÖsk fans as fans of Ruch Chorz√≥w and Widzew ≈Å√≥d≈∫ were involved in the murder of a ≈ölƒÖsk fan in 2003. The main Lechia Gda≈Ñsk fan group posted that the decision for Wis≈Ça to form a friendship with Ruch was unacceptable for the fans of Lechia, and that the friendship was to be terminated.

The following decades saw many racing drivers compete in various different racing chassis. Michael Varacins is the most successful driver in the class winning seven times, at five different tracks. Varacins also builds his own chassis. During the early years of the class the Zink were far superior winning five straight; the chassis won ten total championships. The Lynx chassis name was later changed to Caracal. The Lynx/Caracal chassis has won the most of any other chassis at twelve championships. Later in the class history, the introduction of the Vortech chassis in 2001 started an era of dominance. The chassis type won the race eight consecutive years in a row with three different drivers. ==Race winners== {  - ! Year !! Track !! Winner !! Car !!

The line of variations (LOV, uncertainty region) allows the asteroid to impact Earth or pass as far away as . Its diameter of 2‚Äì4 meters makes it approximately 100‚Äì1000 times less massive than the 20-meter Chelyabinsk meteor. An Earth- impact by this asteroid, assuming it is a common primitive chondrite, might rattle some windows after an airburst and/or drop pebble-sized meteorites on roof tops after dark flight. == Description == has a low 3.2¬∞ orbital inclination with respect to the ecliptic plane and an Earth-MOID of only 9700 km. Since the asteroid last approached Earth in November 2018 and has a 2.00 year orbital period, the asteroid will approach Earth again around 2 November 2020 (¬±3 days). Where Earth will be on a given date is known, but given the short observation arc and having not been observed since 2018 where precisely the asteroid will be on its orbit is not.

Large ground-based observatories take 10 hours to image a magnitude ~28 object. The Hubble Space Telescope needs 3 weeks of exposure time to image magnitude 31 objects. The November 2020 Earth approach will be hidden by the glare of the Sun due to the asteroid's low solar elongation in that time. Since the asteroid is only about in diameter it is too small to do more than create a bolide and common strewn field similar to the Sutter's Mill meteorite or 2014 AA. It is not categorized as a potentially hazardous object given the estimated size is smaller than the threshold for potentially hazardous objects which are estimated at more than 140 meters in diameter. == Notes  References  External links == * List Of Apollo Minor Planets (by designation), Minor Planet Center * * * IAWN: 2018 VP1 Geometry (2018 Approach) * Table of Asteroids Next Closest Approaches to the Earth ‚Äì Sormano Astronomical Observatory # Category:Minor planet object articles (unnumbered) Category:Potential impact events caused by near- Earth objects 20201102 Category:Astronomical objects discovered in 2018 ","title":"2018 VP1"},{"id":"61334803","text":"Kargala () is a rural locality (a village) in Surensky Selsoviet, Zianchurinsky District, Bashkortostan, Russia.

Under the administration of President Fidel V. Ramos, the farm was opened for joint development with the private sector and thegovernment-owned property was placed for bidding. The Gotianuns acquired the farm after it bested the bids of companies of the Ayala and Gokongwei families in a government-organized bidding. The project was started by the Filinvest Development Corporation (FDC) through its founder Andrew L. Gotianun Sr. FDC established the Filinvest Alabang, Inc. on August 25, 1993, for the purpose of entering a joint agreement with the government to develop the farm. The development was earlier known as the Filinvest Corporate City but was rebranded as Filinvest City to reflect a shift of the area as a mixed-use development from a primarily commercial venture. The master plan for Filinvest was revised in 2017 with the help of Singaporean firm AECOM. This led to the opening of the Spectrum Linear Park and the Northgate Cyberzone district cooling system, by early 2018. ==Management== Filinvest City is managed by Filinvest Alabang, Inc. which is a subsidiary of Filinvest Development Corporation and Filinvest Land Inc.. Under the joint agreement with the government, the FAI owned 74 percent stake in Filinvest City. ==Residential areas== Among the residential settlements in Filinvest City include Botanika Nature Residence, Vivant Flats, La Vie Flats, and the Bristol at Parkway Place. ==See also== *Araneta City *Bonifacio Global City *Makati Central Business District ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in Muntinlupa Category:Business parks of the Philippines ","title":"Filinvest City"},{"id":"61335005","text":"Josh Beckerman (performs as The Foodie Magician) is a mentalist, magician and comedian.

The events were organized and executed by a group of artists that included Mar√≠a Teresa Gramuglio, Nicol√°s Rosa, Juan Pablo Renzi, Le√≥n Ferrari, Roberto Jacoby, Norberto Puzzolo, and Graciela Carnevale. == Background == Their goal was to expose the situation in Tucum√°n Province, an impoverished province was one of the biggest sugar-producing regions in the country. The government had just closed the sugar refineries causing economic and social distress. The government had tried to use the region as an example of the soundness of its economic policy, calling it the \\"garden of the republic\\" in its propaganda. The artists sought to circumvent censorship efforts to expose the actual poverty and starvation. Because of this situation, Tucum√°n came to be an example of governmental hypocrisy and negligence. Out of the twenty-three Argentinean provinces, it ranked sixth in production but sixteenth in literacy, fifteenth in infant mortality and thirteenth in school retention. Juan Carlos Ongan√≠a, the head of the dictatorship chose the province as a place to represent the stability of his governmental policies. The government publicized a fictional industrialization plan and promoted the slogan ‚ÄúTucuman, the Garden of the Republic‚Äù accompanied by paradisal posters of the province. It was an orchestrated cover-up of the economic and political crisis. Camnitzer, Luis. Conceptualism in Latin American Art: Didactics of Liberation. Tucum√°n Arde- Politics in Art pg. 60-92. University of Texas Press, 2007. Also during 1968, Argentina witnessed an increase of rebellion by artists against the government. The brutal oppression of the military dictatorship and the limits enforced on the artists‚Äô freedom of expression developed into a crisis. == Overview == The artists' project unfolded in several phases, beginning with a research phase in which participants gathered information about the living and working conditions in the province. Then, the collective organized a series of exhibitions in three different cities--Buenos Aires, Santa Fe, and Rosario‚Äîto publicize their findings. To promote the exhibitions, they used graffiti and stickers all over the city. In August 1968, artists from Rosario, Santa Fe and Buenos Aires organized the ‚ÄúFirst National Meeting of Avant-Garde Art‚Äù to generate a form of art that would be completely new: ethically, aesthetically, and ideologically. With the help of sociologists, economists, journalists, and photographers, the group decided to start an operation of ‚Äúcounter-information‚Äù to counteract the government‚Äôs publicity about Tucum√°n and to reveal the real condition of the province. The artists aimed to become publicists and activists in the social struggle in Tucuman. This project came to be Tucum√°n Arde (Tucum√°n is Burning). It was the Rosario artists who dealt with the repercussions of the work. There were only two artists from Buenos Aires, Le√≥n Ferrari, and Roberto Jacoby. == Phases  First Stage === The artists gathered information--including statistics and firsthand accounts--on the Tucum√°n problem and the social reality of the province. This stage was completed with a prior fact-finding trip, to mark the essential aspects of the problem and establish the first connections. === Second Stage === This stage consisted of confrontation and verification of the Tucum√°n reality for which the artists traveled to Tucum√°n alongside a technical team of journalists, where interviews, reports, recordings were done to use them in the denunciation-exhibition. === Third Stage === The denunciation-exhibition was held to reveal the profound contradictions caused by the economic-political system based on hunger and unemployment and the creation of a false cultural superstructure. It was held in both Rosario and central Buenos Aires. In Rosario, the exhibition took place in the buildings of the Conferderacion General de Trabajadores de Los Argentinos (CGT, General Workers Confederation of the Argentines). Forty people contributed to the creation of the show. All the documented material from the trip was used in a montage of audio-visual media, including oral information to the public on the part of the artists, intellectuals and specialists who participated in the investigation. The exhibits included collected interviews with the people about living conditions in Tucuman, mural photographs, and research about the accumulation of wealth by the richer families. Walking into the exhibit the public stepped on the names of the owners of the sugar plantations. Additionally, the rooms were darkened every ten minutes to represent the frequency of deaths of children. Each time the facts were explained through loudspeakers in every room. The exhibition lasted two weeks in Rosario, but the similar exhibition in Buenos Aires was closed after two days. Police pressure on the unions became so strong that the CGT caved in rather than risk larger repercussions. The artists described the project as the pursuit of a cultural profile of the province. Using that they deceived the media and received favorable coverage for their project. === Fourth Stage === The fourth and last stage consisted of the closing of the information circuit on the Tucum√°n problem and comprised gathering and analysis of the documentation; publication of the results of the analysis; publication of bibliographic and audio-visual materials; and founding of a new aesthetic and evaluation. Bradley, Will, and Charles Esche. Art and Social Change: A Critical Reader. Tucum√°n Arde pg. 161-163. Tate Pub., 2007. Material from the original exhibition was included in documenta 12 and credited to the Grupo de Artistas de Vanguardia. === Analysis === Tucum√°n Arde was both a success and a failure. Despite the short duration of the events set an example for what the manifesto handed at the entrance of the exhibition called for, ‚Äúan art that modifies the totality of the social structure; an art that transforms, one that destroys the idealist separation between artwork and reality.‚Äù However, the participants only focused on the event and not on the broader strategy that could have generated other events. After Tucum√°n Arde , police and army repression increased and most of the artists who had been involved in the project stopped producing art for several years. Some went underground and joined the guerilla movement, some were ‚Äúdisappeared‚Äù and at least one of them died, Eduardo Favario. Galleries only showed apolitical and harmless traditional paintings. This period became known as the \\"Silence of Tucum√°n Arde\\". Tucum√°n Arde was fundamentally a political project because artists were responding to the reality of repression and awareness of socioeconomic inequality. These conditions triggered the intervention of art into politics. Even artists originally distant from social issues became politicized. Although Tucum√°n Arde was designed to affect the exploited people, who were supposed to become coauthors an change the course of the story, its main impact was on the elite which included artists who defined themselves as part of Avant-Garde. Due to this, one can say that Latin American conceptualism emerged as an aesthetic more concerned with reality than with abstraction. ==References== Category:Tucum√°n Province Category:Protests in Argentina Category:Argentine art Category:1968 in Argentina ","title":"Tucum√°n arde"},{"id":"61335025","text":"Eat Your Heart Out may refer to: ==Film and TV== *Eat Your Heart Out (film) *An episode of The Andy Griffith Show *An episode of Fat Friends *An episode of I Love Money *An episode of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills *An episode of Total Divas ==Music== *Eat Your Heart Out (band) *Eat Your Heart Out Records, founded by Alec Empire *An album by Klinik ===Songs=== *\\"Eat Your Heart Out\\" Walk the Moon discography *A song by Dio on The Last in Line *A song by Hungry Kids of Hungary on Escapades *A song by Kiss on Monster *A song by Lydia on Paint It Golden *A song by Molly Hatchet on Devil's Canyon *A single by Paul Hardcastle *A song by Prima Donna on Kiss Kiss *A song by Saint Motel on ForPlay *A single by Xavion ==Other uses== *Eat Your Heart Out: Food Profiteering in America, a book by Jim Hightower *A story by Richard Dean Starr ","title":"Eat Your Heart Out"},{"id":"61335049","text":"Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital is well known public hospital in Nepal.

It has been sold and used by a number of United States government agencies, including U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Orlando, Florida police, as well as private entities. == Capabilities == Rekognition provides a number of computer vision capabilities, which can be divided into two categories: Algorithms that are pre-trained on data collected by Amazon or its partners, and algorithms that a user can train on a custom dataset. As of July 2019, Rekognition provides the following computer vision capabilities. === Pre-trained algorithms === * Celebrity recognition in images * Facial attribute detection in images, including gender, age range, emotions (e.g. happy, calm, disgusted), whether the face has a beard or mustache, whether the face has eyeglasses or sunglasses, whether the eyes are open, whether the mouth is open, whether the person is smiling, and the location of several markers such as the pupils and jaw line. * People Pathing enables tracking of people through a video. An advertised use-case of this capability is to track sports players for post- game analysis. * Text detection and classification in images * Unsafe visual content detection === Algorithms that a user can train on a custom dataset === * SearchFaces enables users to import a database of images with pre-labeled faces, to train a machine learning model on this database, and to expose the model as a cloud service with an API. Then, the user can post new images to the API and receive information about the faces in the image. The API can be used to expose a number of capabilities, including identifying faces of known people, comparing faces, and finding similar faces in a database. * Face-based user verification == History and use 2017=== In late 2017, the Washington County, Oregon Sheriff's Office began using Rekognition to identify suspects' faces. Rekognition was marketed as a general-purpose computer vision tool, and an engineer working for Washington County decided to use the tool for facial analysis of suspects. Rekognition was offered to the department for free, and Washington County became the first US law enforcement agency known to use Rekognition. In 2018, the agency logged over 1,000 facial searches. The county, according to the Washington Post, by 2019 was paying about $7 a month for all of its searches. The relationship was unknown to the public until May 2018. In 2018, Rekognition was also used to help identify celebrities during a royal wedding telecast. ===2018=== In April 2018, it was reported that FamilySearch was using Rekognition to enable their users to \\"see which of their ancestors they most resemble based on family photographs.\\" In early 2018, the FBI also began using it as a pilot program for analyzing video surveillance. In May 2018, it was reported by the ACLU that Orlando, Florida was running a pilot using Rekognition for facial analysis in law enforcement, with that pilot ending in July 2019. After the report, on June 22, 2018, Gizmodo reported that Amazon workers had written a letter to CEO Jeff Bezos requesting he cease selling Rekognition to US law enforcement, particularly ICE and Homeland Security. A letter was also sent to Bezos by the ACLU. On June 26, 2018, it was reported that the Orlando, Florida police force had ceased using Rekognition after their trial contract expired, reserving the right to use it in the future. The Orlando Police Department said that they had \\"never gotten to the point to test images\\" due to old infrastructure and low bandwidth. In July 2018, the ACLU released a test showing that Rekognition had falsely matched 28 members of Congress with mugshot photos, particularly Congresspeople of color. 25 House members afterwards sent a letter to Bezos, expressing concern about Rekognition. Amazon responded saying the Rekognition test had generated 80 percent confidence, while it recommended law enforcement only use matches rated at 99 percent confidence. The Washington Post states that Oregon instead has officers pick a \\"best of five\\" result, instead of adhering to the recommendation. In September 2018, it was reported that Mapillary was using Rekognition to read the text on parking signs (e.g. no stopping, no parking, or specific parking hours) in cities. In October 2018, it was reported that Amazon had earlier that year pitched Rekognition to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. Amazon defended government use of Rekognition. On December 1, 2018, it was reported that 8 Democratic lawmakers had said in a letter that Amazon had \\"failed to provide sufficient answers\\" about Rekognition, writing that they had \\"serious concerns that this type of product has significant accuracy issues, places disproportionate burdens on communities of color, and could stifle Americans' willingness to exercise their First Amendment rights in public.\\" ===2019=== In January 2019, MIT researchers published a peer-reviewed study asserting that Rekognition had more difficulty in identifying dark-skinned females than competitors such as IBM and Microsoft. In the study, Rekognition misidentified darker-skinned women as men 31% of the time, but made no mistakes for light-skinned men. Amazon called the report \\"misinterpreted results\\" of the research with an improper \\"default confidence threshold.\\" In January 2019, Amazon's shareholders \\"urged Amazon to stop selling Rekognition software to law enforcement agencies.\\" Amazon in response defended its use of Rekognition, but supported new federal oversight and guidelines to \\"make sure facial recognition technology cannot be used to discriminate.\\" In February 2019, it was reported that Amazon was collaborating with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) on developing standardized tests to improve accuracy and remove bias with facial recognition. In March 2019, an open letter regarding Rekognition was sent by a group of prominent AI researchers to Amazon, criticizing its sale to law enforcement with around 50 signatures. In April 2019, Amazon was told by the Securities and Exchange Commission that they had to vote on two shareholder proposals seeking to limit Rekognition. Amazon argued that the proposals were an \\"insignificant public policy issue for the Company\\" not related to Amazon's ordinary business, but their appeal was denied. The vote was set for May. The first proposal was tabled by shareholders. On May 24, 2019, 2.4% of shareholders voted to stop selling Rekognition to government agencies, while a second proposal calling for a study into Rekognition and civil rights had 27.5% support. In August 2019, the ACLU again used Rekognition on members of government, with 26 of 120 lawmakers in California flagged as matches to mugshots. Amazon stated the ACLU was \\"misusing\\" the software in the tests, by not dismissing results that did not meet Amazon's recommended accuracy threshold of 99%. By August 2019, there had been protests against ICE's use of Rekognition to surveil immigrants. In March 2019, Amazon announced a Rekognition update that would improve emotional detection, and in August 2019, \\"fear\\" was added to emotions that Rekognition could detect. ===2020=== In June 2020, Amazon announced it was implementing a one-year moratorium on police use of Rekognition, in response to the George Floyd protests. == Controversy regarding facial analysis  Racial and gender bias === In 2018, MIT researchers Joy Buolamwini and Timnit Gebru published a study called Gender Shades. In this study, a set of images was collected, and faces in the images were labeled with face position, gender, and skin tone information. The images were run through SaaS facial recognition platforms from Face++, IBM, and Microsoft. In all three of these platforms, the classifiers performed best on male faces (with error rates on female faces being 8.1% to 20.6% higher than error rates on male faces), and they performed worst on dark female faces (with error rates ranging from 20.8% to 30.4%). The authors hypothesized that this discrepancy is due principally to Megvii, IBM, and Microsoft having more light males than dark females in their training data, i.e. dataset bias. In January 2019, researchers Inioluwa Deborah Raji and Joy Buolamwini published a follow-up paper that ran the experiment again a year later, on the latest versions same three SaaS facial recognition platforms, plus two additional platforms: Kairos, and Amazon Rekognition. While the systems' overall error-rates improved over the previous year, all five of the systems again performed better on male faces than on dark female faces. == See also == * Amazon Lex * Amazon Mechanical Turk * Amazon Polly * Amazon SageMaker * Amazon Web Services *Facial recognition system * Timeline of Amazon Web Services == References == Category:2016 software Rekognition Rekognition Category:Cloud infrastructure Category:Computer vision software Category:Data mining and machine learning software Category:Facial recognition software Category:Object recognition and categorization ","title":"Amazon Rekognition"},{"id":"61335115","text":"Abu Hena Bablu is a Bangladeshi Cinematographer.

The town was incorporated on August 16, 1899. Records from a contemporary Alabama newspaper, The Peoples' Journal, described the municipality as \\"the only municipality controlled and governed entirely by colored people anywhere in the United States.\\" The newspaper further commented, \\"The whole country will doubtless be interested in the result of this experiment.\\" Under the leadership of the first mayor, S. L. Davis, and the first police chief, James Duran, police protection was restored to the area. The town was named after Richmond P. Hobson, a white naval hero in the then-recent Spanish-American War and member of Congress. ==Death Threats== In the summer of 1919, the mayor of Hobson City, Alabama was Newman O'Neal. He served his community until he received death threats in the form of a \\"Black Hand Letter surmounted by a skull and crossbones.\\" He ignored the letter but he was assaulted by unknown aggressors and seriously injured forcing him north into exile in late July of 1919. The acting Mayor J.D. Kirksey also received an unsigned death threat letter. Author Cameron McWhirter says this was a typical tactic of the Ku Klux Klan. ==Aftermath== This uprising was one of several incidents of civil unrest that began in the so-called American Red Summer, of 1919. The Summer consisted of terrorist attacks on black communities, and white oppression in over three dozen cities and counties. In most cases, white mobs attacked African American neighborhoods. In some cases, black community groups resisted the attacks, especially in Chicago and Washington, D.C.. Most deaths occurred in rural areas during events like the Elaine Race Riot in Arkansas, where an estimated 100 to 240 black people and 5 white people were killed. Also occurring in 1919 were the Chicago Race Riot and Washington D.C. race riot which killed 38 and 39 people respectively, and with both having many more non-fatal injuries and extensive property damage reaching up into the millions of dollars. ==See also== *Washington race riot of 1919 *Mass racial violence in the United States *List of incidents of civil unrest in the United States ==Bibliography== Notes References * * \\\\- Total pages: 277 * * \\\\- Total pages: 368 * * Category:1919 in Alabama Category:July 1919 events Category:African- American history between emancipation and the civil rights movement Category:History of racism in Alabama Category:History of the United States (1918‚Äì1945) Category:Racially motivated violence against African Americans Category:Riots and civil disorder in Alabama Category:Year of birth missing Category:Year of death missing ","title":"Newman O'Neal"},{"id":"61335135","text":"\\"Taking It On\\" is a song written by Lynsey de Paul and Ron Roker, and originally published by ATV Music.

He was not selected to be in the poll but the rules did not require voters be readers of the news site; the votes were prompted by alt-right influencers, and media outlets like Breitbart where he worked. People of the Year In 2016, the Pulse nightclub attack victims were named People of the Year. LGBTQ Nation, and the other top five LGBTQ news websites, were criticized for the coverage of the forty-nine murder victims, most of who were LGBTQ, as well as people of color POC, mostly Latinx queer people. The coverage tended to ignore the intersectionality of the victims: emphasizing them being LGBTQ, while minimizing, or omitting their being POC; discussing security while ignoring historical oppression of LGBTQ, and POC communities by police, and security personnel; looking at LGBTQ romantic lives through a heteronormative focus; and ethnic imperialism, positioning POC, and immigrants as less evolved, or informed as White U.S. citizens. LGBTQ Nation was alone in not printing all the names, and photos, or other identifying information: this is relevant in that not all the victims were out to their families; and some were not legal immigrants; such information could affect other family members or trigger deportation processes. ==Notes== * * ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:2010 establishments in the United States Category:LGBT-related mass media in the United States Category:LGBT-related magazines published in the United States Category:LGBT-related websites ","title":"LGBTQ Nation"},{"id":"61335158","text":"Luch () is a rural locality (a village) in Tazlarovsky Selsoviet, Zianchurinsky District, Bashkortostan, Russia.

The transition period of the now-defunct Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) into the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) began when the Bangsamoro Organic Law was ratified in a two-part plebiscite held on January and February 2019. It is set to end after the first set of regular officials are elected in 2022. ==Background== The Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao was created after residents in then-existing Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao voted to ratify the Bangsamoro Organic Law in January 2019. Cotabato City and 67 barangays in Cotabato province also voted to join Bangsamoro in the second part of the plebiscite in February 2019. The initial members of the Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA) were sworn in by President Rodrigo Duterte on February 22, 2019 and the ARMM was officially turned over to the BARMM on February 26, 2019. The new Bangsamoro autonomous region was inaugurated almost a month later on March 29, 2019 when the BTA as the interim Bangsamoro Parliament also held its first session. The Bangsamoro transition plan was then adopted by the Bangsamoro Parliament on June 18, 2019. The transition work was hampered by financial constraints with members of the BTA only receiving their salaries on the first week of July 2019. By that time the BTA is still negotiating for a transition fund from the Department of Budget and Management and the slow transition work has led to President Rodrigo Duterte appointing Manny Pi√±ol who resigned from his post as Agriculture secretary as a point man for the national government in dealing with the Bangsamoro regional government. It is projected that the bureaucracy of the new Bangsamoro government be fully organized by the end of 2019 and the organizational structures of the defunct ARMM be phased out by January 2020. ==Transition plan and priority laws== The Bangsamoro Parliament convenes. During the transition period, the Bangsamoro Transition Authority as the interim parliament had obligations to complete. ===Transition plan=== The Bangsamoro Organic Law mandates interim Chief Minister Murad Ebrahim to submit to the BTA within the first 60 days of the transition period a transition plan containing the Bangsamoro government's \\"proposed organizational plan, as well as, the schedule for implementation therefor.\\" It also requires the approval or action of the BTA on the proposed plan within 10 days upon its submission. If there is failure to act upon the plan within 10 days, the plan would be automatically approved and implemented within 15 days. According to Murad the start of the transition period for the purpose of submitting the transition plan was on March 29, or the inaugural session of the interim parliament. The plan's deadline is stated to be on May 2018. The transition plan was then submitted to the Bangsamoro Parliament on June 17, 2019 and was approved by the legislature the following day. ===Priority laws=== The BTA as the interim Bangsamoro parliament is also required to pass into law \\"priority legislation\\" enumerated in the Bangsamoro Organic Law. Following the fourth session of the parliament, eight ad-hoc committees were formed to draft the priority legislations. These committees were eventually dissolved and by August 2019, the interim Cabinet are working on the drafts instead. These drafts are still to be reviewed for adoption by the parliament.https://www.rappler.com/nation/237363-bta-targets-bangsamoro- government-codes-end-2019 The first three of the six priority codes; namely the Administrative, Civil Service, and Local Government Codes were filed before the Bangsamoro Parliament on July 22, 2020. {  style=\\"text-align: center; font-size:95%;\\" width=30% - !Legislation !Status - align=leftBangsamoro Administrative Code  - align=leftBangsamoro Internal Revenue Code To be legislated - align=leftBangsamoro Civil Service Code  - align=leftBangsamoro Electoral Code To be legislated - align=leftBangsamoro Local Government Code  - align=leftBangsamoro Education Code To be legislated - } ==Inter-governmental relations bodies== The Bangsamoro Organic Law provides for the creation of Inter-governmental relations bodies (IGR) which would facilitate inter-governmental relations between the Bangsamoro regional government and the Philippine national government. Five IGRs including the National Government-Bangsamoro Government Intergovernmental Relations Body has been constituted as of September 2020. {  style=\\"text-align: center; font-size:95%;\\" width=100% - !width=70%Inter-governmental relations body !width=30%Foundation or First meeting - National Government-Bangsamoro Government Intergovernmental Relations Body December 16, 2020 - Intergovernmental Fiscal Policy Board May 29, 2020 - Intergovernmental Infrastructure Development Board Constituted (First meeting to be held on October 2020) - Joint Body for the Zones of Joint Cooperation June 26, 2020 - Intergovernmental Energy Board Constituted - Philippine Congress-Bangsamoro Parliament Forum To be constituted - Council of Leaders To be constituted - Bangsamoro Sustainable Development Board To be constituted - } ==Reorganization of government agenciesMinistries=== When the ARMM was succeeded by the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) in 2019, the regional departments of the former Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao were reconfigured into ministries of Bangsamoro. {  style=\\"text- align: center; font-size:95%;\\" width=100% - !width=70%Preceding agency or agencies !width=30%Ministry - Department of Agriculture, Department of Agrarian Reform  Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Agrarian Reform - Department of Education, Commission on Higher Education, Technical Education and Skills Development Authority  Ministry of Basic, Higher and Technical Education - Department of Environment and Natural Resources, Department of Energy  Ministry of Environment, Natural Resources and Energy - Department of Health  Ministry of Health - Department of Public Works and Highways  Ministry of Public Works - } ===Bangsamoro police=== The Police Regional Office Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (PRO ARMM) of the Philippine National Police (PNP) was organized sometime in 2019 as the Police Regional Office Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (PRO BARMM). Since the Bangsamoro autonomous region had a slightly larger scope than its predecessor, the new police regional office had to expand its jurisdiction as well. They were previous proposals to create an independent police force for the region, but did not materialized. By April 2019, the PRO BARMM had started its gradual takeover of additional areas. They started supervising the Cotabato City Police which is still administratively under the control of Police Regional Office 12. They also began planning on how to put the barangays in Cotabato that are part of Bangsamoro under their jurisdiction. An agreement was signed on July 5, 2019 that would allow former fighters of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) and Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) rebel groups to join the PNP with age, height, and education requirements waived. However applicants through this process must attain the necessary educational requirements within 15 years after joining the police force. ==Integration of local government unitsBarangays in Cotabato province=== Upon the effective foundation of the new Bangsamoro autonomous region, the 63 barangays in Cotabato province which voted to become part of Bangsamoro remained part of their parent municipalities. Their residents voted for municipal officials of their parent municipalities and Cotabato provincial officials in the 2019 Philippine general election. The barangays could be reorganized into one or more municipalities or merged with any of the neighboring municipalities of Maguindanao. These barangays were still not under the effective control of Bangsamoro as of July 2019 since they were not yet officially turned over to Bangsamoro regional government which was initially set to occur once a local government code is passed by the Bangsamoro Parliament. With the local government code still pending, the official turnover took place on November 20, 2019. The Sangguniang Panlalawigan of Cotabato has passed a resolution concerning the transfer. Amidst budgetary concerns, the barangays were assured that they will still receive their Internal Revenue Allocation directly from the Department of Budget and Management after the transfer takes place. By March 2020, the 63 barangays were already grouped into a Special Geographic Area of the Bangsamoro region.https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1097353 ===Cotabato City=== The formal turnover of Cotabato City to the Bangsamoro regional government has met opposition from Cotabato City Cynthia Guiani- Sayadi. Cotabato City voted in favor of its inclusion to the Bangsamoro region in the 2019 plebiscite but Sayadi had expressed intent to file electoral protest claiming irregularities in the conduct of the plebiscite in here city. A resident filed a protest. The Bangsamoro regional government has pushed for the formal turnover of Cotabato City to the region as soon as possible while Mayor Sayadi has formally requested President Rodrigo Duterte to defer the transfer of the city to Bangsamoro until June 30, 2022 when it is expected that the \\"BARMM bureaucracy would have been fully operational\\" or the formal end of the transition period. Sayadi was informed that the Department of Interior and Local Government has deferred the transfer to at least December 2020. ==Decommissioning of the MILF== A MILF fighter. Under the Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro signed between the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) and the Philippine national government in 2014, the rebel group would start to decommission its forces once the Bangsamoro autonomous region is set up. The decommissioning process is to be oversaw by the Independent Decommissioning Body in coordination with the Joint Normalization Committee and the Task Force for Decommissioned Combatants. The MILF started the first phase of the process when it submitted a list of its weapons and combatants for decommissioning to the government. The list accounts for 12,000 militants or a third of the MILF's forces. The MILF will field candidates in the 2022 local elections through its political wing, the United Bangsamoro Justice Party. ==Timeline== *January 21, 2019 ‚Äì First part of the Bangsamoro autonomy plebiscite where voters voted on the ratification of the Bangsamoro Organic Law. *January 25, 2019 ‚Äì The Commission on Elections announced that the Bangsamoro Organic Law is \\"deemed\\" ratified. *February 6, 2019 ‚Äì Second part of the Bangsamoro autonomy plebiscite to determined potential additional areas for the then-proposed Bangsamoro autonomous region. *February 22, 2019 ‚Äì First set of members of the Bangsamororo Transition Authority took oath. including first and interim Chief Minister, Murad Ebrahim. *February 26, 2019 ‚Äì Official turnover of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao to the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao. *March 29, 2019 ‚Äì Inauguration of the new Bangsamoro regional government., first ever session of the Bangsamoro Parliament. and appointment of Khalipa Usman Nando as first Wali of Bangsamoro. *June 18, 2019 ‚Äì Bangsamoro transition plan approved by the Bangsamoro Parliament. *November 20, 2019 ‚Äì Formal turnover of the 63 barangays in Cotabato to the Bangsamoro regional government. *December 16, 2019 ‚Äì National Government-Bangsamoro Government Intergovernmental Relations Body held its first meeting. *June 30, 2022 ‚Äì Last day of the Bangsamoro transition period. == Comparisons == {  style=\\"font- size:85%;\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\"  Body ! scope=\\"col\\"  Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao ! scope=\\"col\\"  Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"border-left-width:5px;\\"  (National government only) - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Constitutional document  ARMM Organic Act (Republic Act No. 6734)  Organic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region (Republic Act No. 11054)  style=\\"border-left-width:5px;\\"  Constitution of the Philippines - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Head of the region or territory  rowspan=\\"2\\"  Regional Governor of the ARMM  Wali of Bangsamoro  rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"border-left-width:5px;\\"  President of the Philippines - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Head of government  Chief Minister of Bangsamoro - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Executive  Executive departments of the ARMM  Bangsamoro Cabinet  style=\\"border-left-width:5px;\\"  Executive departments of the Philippines - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Legislative  Regional Legislative Assembly  Bangsamoro Parliament  style=\\"border-left-width:5px;\\"  Bicameral Congress (Senate and House of Representatives) - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Judiciary  None (under Supreme Court)  Bangsamoro Shari'ah court system (ultimately under Supreme Court)  style=\\"border-left-width:5px;\\"  Supreme Court - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Legal Supervisory or Prosecution  None (under Philippine government)  Planned (before 2016)  style=\\"border-left-width:5px;\\"  Department of Justice (DOJ) - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Police Force(s)  Police Regional Office Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (PRO ARMM) (under the Philippine National Police)  Police Regional Office Bangsamoro Autonomous Region (PRO BAR) (under the PNP)  style=\\"border-left-width:5px;\\"  Philippine National Police (PNP) - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Shariah law  colspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  Yes, for Muslims only  style=\\"border-left-width:5px;\\"  \\"Code of Muslim Personal Laws of the Philippines\\" issued in 1977 under Presidential Decree No. 1083 } ==References== Transition period Category:2019 in the Philippines Category:2020 in the Philippines Category:2021 in the Philippines Category:2022 in the Philippines Transition period ","title":"Bangsamoro transition period"},{"id":"61335261","text":"The Bhuyan (Also known as Bhuiya, Bhuiyan and Bhuinya) are an originally Non- Aryan Austro-Dravidian ethnic group found mainly in many districts of Odisha.

They are classified as a Scheduled Tribe by the Indian government. ==Etymology== The tribe is also called variously as Bhuiya, Bhuiyan and Bhuinya.The word Bhuyan and its alternate spellings are possibly originated from Sanskrit word for earth, Bhumi and possibly mean \\"belonging to soil\\". The word bhuiyan is used in many different contexts and does not always refer to the tribe. Some other tribes and some non-tribal landholders also use Bhuyan as title. ==History== Early history of the tribe is uncertain. But the Bhuyan was one of the most populous and widespread tribes in colonial india. The Northern Tributary States of Orissa were the principal stronghold of the Bhuyans. It is speculated that they were the oldest inhabitants of the states of Keonjhar, Bonai, Gangapur, Bamra and Singhbhum. They were also found in Bengal, Bihar, Chhotanagpur, Assam, the United Provinces, the Central Provinces, Central India Agency and the Madras Presidency. In the feudatory state of Keonjhar and Bonai the tribe was especially powerful. They had traditional rights to install the Raja of the state. ==Subdivisions== Broadly Bhuyans can be divided into two groups according to their general area of residence. Hill Bhuyans - Known as Pawri or Pauri Bhuyan, they generally live in the hilly and inaccessible forest areas. They have a more primitive mode of life and more economically disadvantaged, and traditionally engaged in Podu cultivation. They were however politically powerful and the rulers of the Keonjhar state were dependent on their support. Plains Bhuyans- Plains Bhuyans live among nontribal populations and are influenced by the Hinduism and its rituals. During British rule they were the organised militia of the Keonjhar state. Both of them held the lands on conditions of service and maintained themselves in a state of preparedness for taking the field at a moments notice to oppose their Raja or fight for him. == Culture == The Bhuyans usually live in small homogeneous and villages. Their family structure is mostly nuclear. A group of families with blood relations form the smallest social unit called or the lineage. Several agnatic constitute an exogamous clan called {{transloribonso or . All members of a are believed to have a common ancestor. Members of many different or the same form a village. Intra-village marriage was forbidden. Marriages by capture is practised is called ghichha. Other social sanctioned forms of marriage are marriage by elopement, by love and by negotiation. On death of a family member death pollution is observed for two to three days. At the end of it, the villagers are given a feast by the bereaved family. The Bhuyans have a mixed pantheon of deities. They worship deities of animism such as Badam, Gainsari, and Barahipat. They also worship deities derived from hindu theology such as Dharam Devata (Sun God) and Basukimata (Earth Goddess) and Hanuman.They traditionally take part in the Rathyatra at puri. Additionally they also celebrate festivals like Karama, Magh Porai, and Gamha Punai. In every Bhuyan village there is a traditional panchayat which meets at the darbar (community center) whenever required. The village headman or pradhan presides over the panchayat. A group of villages form a confederation called a pidha. The panchayat at this level is called the pidha panchayat, and there is a secular headman who presides over it is called the sardar. These councils handle their community matters. ==See Also== *Bhuiyan, Bengali title/surname * Keonjhar State * Bonai State ==References== Category:Scheduled Tribes of India Category:Social groups of Odisha Category:Scheduled Tribes of Odisha ","title":"Bhuyan"},{"id":"61335265","text":"The Most Gallant Order of Pahlawan Negara Brunei (), also translated as The Most Gallant Order of the Hero of the State of Brunei, is an order of Brunei.

He was the British Political Resident for the Persian Gulf from 1838 ‚Äì 1852 and described by Professor JB Kelly as: 'without doubt the greatest Political Resident Britain has ever had in the Persian Gulf.' == Early career == Samuel Hennell was tutored preparatory to entering service with the East India Company by Mr Williams of Edmonton. He was appointed Assistant Resident for the Persian Gulf, based in Bushire, in 1826, taking up his post six scant years following the British punitive expedition against the Al Qasimi at Ras Al Khaimah of 1819 and the conclusion of the subsequent General Maritime Treaty of 1820. He was appointed Political Resident in the Persian Gulf in 1838. == Maritime Truce == Hennell conceived the idea of a maritime truce between the Gulf Sheikhdoms which would cement the provisions already agreed in the 1820 General Maritime Treaty. The new treaty would run for the pearling season, between May and November and bind all of the Rulers to avoid hostilities at sea, give full redress for any infractions committed by their subjects, avoid retaliation but report incidents to the Resident, let the Resident know if any hostilities were intended at the end of the truce and in turn obliged the Resident to enforce the truce and act to obtain reparations for any injuries inflicted by one Ruler's subjects on another's.Britain and the Gulf Shaikhdoms, 1820‚Äì1971: The Politics of Protection - James Onley Center for International and Regional Studies Georgetown University School of Foreign Service The treaty effectively made the British the chief broker of peace in the region and was received with enthusiasm during a meeting at Basidu on the island of Qeshm, between Sultan bin Saqr Al Qasimi, Ruler of Ras Al Khaimah and Sharjah and Shakhbut bin Dhiyab Al Nahyan, Ruler of Abu Dhabi. The two Rulers approved of the idea and Hennell invited Obeid bin Said bin Rashid of Dubai and Rashid bin Humaid Al Nuaimi of Ajman to join them. The Truce as proposed by Hennell was signed by all four Rulers in Bushire on the 21 August 1835. Umm Al Quwain at the time was subject to Ras Al Khaimah and so did not sign independently. Although signed in August, the Treaty bound its signatories from May 1835 to November 1835. Hennell subsequently reported how news ‚Äúcame in from all quarters of the joy and satisfaction diffused amongst the inhabitants of the whole line of the Arabian Coast of the Gulf on the intelligence reaching them of the establishment of the Truce.‚Äù === Trucial States === Pronounced a great success, the Truce was to be renewed in subsequent years, becoming a year-round agreement from 1838 onwards. The series of truces led to the Sheikhdoms of the Lower Gulf becoming referred to as the 'Trucial States'. On 1 June 1843, a ten-year treaty was signed by the rulers. Hennell, buoyed by his success as a peacemaker between the Sheikdoms of the Lower Gulf, also concluded a treaty with Kuwait when, in 1841, Abdullah II of Kuwait signed a one-year naval truce with Hennell, which however expired and was not renewed. The truce prohibited Kuwait from undertaking any form of maritime offense as well as giving all mediation efforts in maritime disputes over to the British Empire. In 1853, the Perpetual Maritime Truce of 4 May 1853 prohibited any act of aggression at sea and was signed by Abdulla bin Rashid Al Mualla of Umm Al Quwain; Humaid bin Rashid Al Nuaimi of Ajman; Saeed bin Butti of Dubai; Saeed bin Tahnun Al Nahyan ('Chief of the Beniyas') and Sultan bin Saqr Al Qasimi ('Chief of the Joasmees'). This treaty was signed by Hennell's former deputy and now successor, Arnold Burrowes Kemball. == Marriage == On 28 November 1837, Hennell (then carrying the rank of Captain) married Anne Inman Orton, the eldest daughter of James Orton, the surgeon and Head of the Medical Board for the British East India Company in Bombay, at Bycullah. They had two sons, James Bruce Hennell, born in 1843 at Bushire and William Frederick Hennell, born in Bushire on 27 October 1850. Soon after, in 1852, the Hennells returned to England, where Hennell, retiring as a Colonel in the Grenadier Regiment of the Bombay Native Infantry, took up residence in Charlton Rings, Gloucestershire. Both of Anne and Samuel Hennell's sons travelled to serve in the Indian army and, in 1879, both were killed during the Afghan War. Hennell died, at the age of 80, the following year. == References == Category:1800 births Category:1880 deaths Category:British Indian Army officers ","title":"Samuel Hennell"},{"id":"61335280","text":"Pasha Syafiq Ali (born 19 January 1996) is a Malaysian cricketer who plays for the Malaysia national cricket team.

He made his debut in March 2010, and wrestles for Isegahama stable. He reached the top makuuchi division in March 2019 and has a special prize for Fighting Spirit. His highest rank has been Maegashira 3. ==Early life and sumo experience== Shoki was born on the same day and just 15 hours after the Great Hanshin earthquake which hit his local Hy≈çgo Prefecture. Because of this fact he was often called \\"earthquake boy\\" as a child by fellow schoolmates. Having been born on such a day he always felt he needed to do something great and unique with his life. In first grade of elementary school he would take up judo. In his third year of grade school his parents would get a divorce and it was decided that he would retain his father surname of Fukuoka, instead of taking his mother's maiden name of Kikui. Because of the divorce he was often closer to his grandfather, who was an avid sumo fan, and passed this on to Shoki. In his fourth year he would attend a local sumo tournament taking second. This would see him join the local sumo club to train. By the time he was in Junior High School he had placed in the best sixteen at the national championship. Shoki was not a very good student and had great attendance issues, skipping over thirty days of school one year even though he would still regularly attend his sumo club practices. With his dislike of school and his club coach having a connection to Isegahama Oyakata he would decide to join Isegahama stable right after junior high at fifteen years old. ==Career== He would make his debut in March 2010 along with the likes of Kagayaki and Takanosho. He initially failed his physical exam as he was merely 167cm tall and weighed 89kg, but would pass after taking the secondary physical exam. He was given the ring name Terutsuyoshi meaning \\"a strong light\\" by his stablemaster, wishing for him to be a bright light of hope to the survivors of the Kobe earthquake. Despite his small size he would make quick work of the two lowest jonokuchi and jonidan divisions. He would hit his first snag in the sandanme division posting his first make-koshi or losing record. He would spend a year here going back and forth with winning and losing records before making his makushita debut in March 2012. He initially struggled and bounced between sandanme and makushita for a year before becoming a third division mainstay. He would remain this way for three years from January 2013 until November 2016, when a 7-0 y≈´sh≈ç or tournament championship at makushita 9 earned him automatic promotion to the j≈´ry≈ç division and sekitori status. Making his j≈´ry≈ç debut in January 2017, he would initially struggle, managing just two winning records after a year in j≈´ry≈ç, before a disastrous 4-11 record at j≈´ry≈ç 9 would send him back down to makushita. In January 2018 at makushita 1 he would score 4-3 and manage immediate repromotion back up to j≈´ry≈ç. His second stint in j≈´ry≈ç was far better than his first. After just one make- koshi, on the back of four straight winning records he would get a 8-7 score at J≈´ry≈ç 1 gaining him promotion the top makuuchi division. Like with his other division debuts Terutsuyoshi would struggle, getting two back to back 6-9 records. He was somewhat fortunate to remain in the top division for the July 2019 tournament, but at the bottom maegashira 16 spot in July 2019 he would produce his first top division winning record. He would start out with five straight wins before losing on day six to veteran Sadanoumi. He would then go on another winning streak from day nine to day thirteen. On Day fourteen being a part of the leading group he was given a bout against maegashira 1 Hokutofuji, the only opponent he would face above maegashira 7, which he would lose giving him his third loss. On the final day he would face fellow 11-3 record holder Tomokaze who he would then beat by oshidashi giving him a final record of 12-3. After yokozuna Hakuh≈ç's loss to tournament winner Kakury≈´, Terutsuyoshi shared runner-up honours with Hakuh≈ç. He was also awarded the Fighting Spirit prize. Speaking to reporters after his final match he said, \\"\\"I wasn't really thinking about winning the championship, I just thought I should put everything into my sumo.\\" Terutsuyoshi has a habit during the pre-match rituals (but only on the final throw) of grabbing a huge handful of purifying salt and flinging it high into the air, reminiscent of former sekiwake Mitoizumi. ==Fighting style== Despite his small size, Terutsuyoshi prefers a direct attacking style, moving forward rather than attempting to sidestep or pull down his opponents. Terutsuyoshi is unusual in that he prefers a maemitsu grip on his opponent's mawashi or belt ‚Äì grabbing the front part directly below the stomach area. He is also fond of nage (throwing) techniques and has been known to pull off seldom seen techniques such as nekodamashi. However, most of his wins are by frontal push out or force out. His most common winning kimarite is oshidashi closely followed by yorikiri and shitatenage. ==Career recordSee also== *List of sumo tournament top division runners-up *Glossary of sumo terms *List of active sumo wrestlers ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:1995 births Category:Living people Category:Japanese sumo wrestlers Category:Sumo people from Hy≈çgo Prefecture ","title":"Terutsuyoshi Shoki"},{"id":"61335297","text":"The Most Honourable Order of Seri Paduka Mahkota Brunei (), also translated as The Most Honourable Order of the Crown of Brunei, is an order of Brunei.

In the ensuing years, but before 1979, there were three main sources of NASCAR telecasts: *ABC's Wide World of Sports, the sports anthology program, provided coverage of select NASCAR Winston Cup races in the 1970s. In 1971, it presented a 200-lap race at Greenville-Pickens Speedway in its entirety, the first such broadcast of a NASCAR race. Throughout the 1970s, ABC presented portions of the Daytona 500, Southern 500, and other important races. *In the late 1970s, CBS Sports Spectacular aired some races; like Wide World of Sports, they were taped and edited. *Car and Track, a weekly auto racing show hosted by Bud Lindemann, recapped all of NASCAR's top-series races in the 1960s and 1970s in a weekly 30-minute syndicated show. CBS Sports President Neal Pilson and motor-sports editor Ken Squier believed that America would watch an entire stock car race live on television. On February 18, 1979, CBS presented the first flag-to-flag coverage of the Daytona 500. Richard Petty won NASCAR's crown-jewel race for the sixth time, but the big story was the post-race fight on the track's infield between Cale Yarborough and Donnie Allison, who crashed together on the final lap while leading. The race drew incredible ratings, in part due to the compelling action both on and off the track, and in part because a major snowstorm on the East Coast kept millions of viewers indoors. ==List of races televised1970=== { class= - Date Event Network Lap-by-lap Color commentator(s) - 2/22 Daytona 500 ABC Bill Flemming Chris Economaki - 4/12 Alabama 500 (Talladega) ABC Bill Flemming Keith Jackson - 4/18 Gwyn Staley 400 (North Wilkesboro) ABC Keith Jackson Chris Economaki - 5/9 Rebel 400 (Darlington) ABC Jim McKay Ned Jarrett - 5/24 World 600 (Charlotte) ABC Keith Jackson Chris Economaki - 7/4 Firecracker 400 (Daytona) ABC Jim McKay Chris Economaki - 7/25 Nashville 420 ABC Jim McKay Chris Economaki - 9/7 Southern 500 (Darlington) ABC Bill Flemming Chris Economaki - 10/4 Wilkes 400 (North Wilkesboro) ABC Jim McKay Chris Economaki - 10/11 National 500 (Charlotte) ABC Jim McKay Chris Economaki } From 1962 to 1978, the Daytona 500 was shown on ABC's Wide World of Sports.

During the period on Wide World of Sports, the booth announcers typically served as roving pit reporters during the running of the race, as well as interviewing in victory lane.

He is the younger brother of Shah Razen Said, Amalul Said and the elder brother of Adi Said; all four are Brunei international footballers. ==Club career== In 2007, Ahmad Hafiz trained with the under-21 squad of DPMM FC who were a member of the Malaysia Super League at the time. The previous season, his brother Shahrazen became joint top-scorer in the league. Although the league rules at the time dictate that an under-21 player has to start a league match, head coach Yordan Stoykov preferred to utilise breakout star Azwan Saleh in advanced roles due to form and injuries. Ahmad Hafiz was released after DPMM left the Malaysian leagues for the S.League in 2009. Ahmad Hafiz moved to Majra FC of the Brunei Premier League, where a few of his other brothers were playing. He spent five years at the club, winning the League Cup in 2011, right until the club withdrew from the league in the middle of the 2014 season. Ahmad Hafiz transferred to Rimba Star FC along with two of his brothers in 2015. He served as the captain of the team until 2016. Ahmad Hafiz was signed for Lun Bawang FC for the 2018-19 Brunei Super League season, but left before the second round had started. ==International career== Ahmad Hafiz was called up by Kwon Oh-son for the 2008 AFC Challenge Cup qualification matches held in the Philippines in May 2008. At 19 years old, he made his international debut as a starter against Bhutan on 15 May in a 1‚Äì1 draw. He dropped to the bench in the next game against Tajikistan two days later, but came on in the 74th minute to replace Abu Bakar Mahari. The score was already 3‚Äì0 against the Wasps by then. In November 2011, Ahmad Hafiz was selected to compete at the Football at the 2011 Southeast Asian Games held in Indonesia, along with the Under-23s.

Composed of ultrasonically welded strips, Geocells are opened up on-site to form a 3D honeycomb-like matrix, which is then filled with granular soil material to create a soil stabilization / road reinforcement system. In addition to reinforcement of the subgrade, subbase or base layer of roads and railways, cellular confinement is also used for soil stabilization and erosion control in slopes, channels, retention walls, reservoirs and landfills. Neoloy Geocells are manufactured from Neoloy, a novel polymeric alloy (NPA).

Applicable for new road construction, as well as for rehabilitation, Neoloy Geocells are typically used to reinforce the base and subbase layers of pavement types, such as highways, railways, intermodal ports, storage yards and unpaved haul, access and service roads. One notable unpaved road project was undertaken by the UK Royal Engineering Corps Route Trident under difficult conditions in Afghanistan to create a secure patrol road for the benefit of troops and civilians alike. ==Design methodologies== Research includes the development of road design methodologies for Neoloy Geocells.Kief, O.

In particular, a Modulus Improvement Factor (MIF), verified in research and field demos was developed as a reliable method for quantifying the Neoloy Geocell contribution to a pavement structure. The MIF value obtained from field tests, laboratory tests and finite element studies varies between 1.5-5 dependent upon the material of infill, subgrade and location of reinforced layer. ==Sustainable transportation== Neoloy Geocells are considered a sustainable road construction methodPokharel, S.K., Norouzi, M., Martin, I. and Breault, M.

These lower quality materials include locally available but weak soils, sand; recycled and reclaimed construction materials, such as RAP and recycled concrete. Not only does the use of such materials in road construction conserve quarry resources and recycle waste. It also reduces quarry, haul and infill activities, which in turn decreases the amounts of fuel, pollution and the carbon footprint.Norouzi, M., Pokharel, S.K., Breault, M., and Breault, D. (2017). Innovative Solution for Sustainable Road Construction. Leadership in Sustainable Infrastructure Conference Proceedings. May 31-June 3, Vancouver, Canada. Neoloy Geocell reinforcement can also increase the lifespan of pavement structures, which means less repairs and maintenance, further enhancing sustainability. ==How it works== When Neoloy Geocells are deployed and compacted with soil/aggregate, a composite structure is created from the geotechnical interaction of the material, soil and geometry.Alexiew, D. and van Zyl, W. (2019). Cellular Confinement System Reinforcement ‚Äì Innovation at the Base of Sustainable Pavements. 12th Conference on Asphalt Pavements for Southern Africa, Johannesburg. Soil confinement retains infill materials in three dimensions providing high tensile strength on each axis. Under loading Neoloy Geocells generate lateral confinement while soil-to-cell wall friction reduces vertical movement. The high hoop strength of the cell walls, together with the passive earth and passive resistance of adjacent cells, also increases soil strength and stiffness. Aggregate abrasion is minimized by the cell confinement, thereby reducing attrition of the base material. Vertical loading on Neoloy Geocells with compacted infill creates a semi-rigid slab or \\"beam effect\\" in the structure.Vega, E., van Gurp, C., Kwast, E. (2018). Geokunststoffen als Funderingswapening in Ongebonden Funderingslagen (Geosynthetics for Reinforcement of Unbound Base and Subbase Pavement Layers), SBRCURnet (CROW), Netherlands. This distributes the load evenly and effectively over a wider area, thereby increasing bearing capacity and decreasing differential settlement. Research of the reinforcement mechanisms in geocells shows that the stiffness of the geocell material as well as geometry are the most important confinement parameters.Emersleben A., Meyer M. (2009). Interaction Between Hoop Stresses and Passive Earth Resistance in Single and Multiple Geocell Structures, GIGSA GeoAfrica 2009 Conference, Cape Town, South Africa, September 2‚Äì5 ==Environmental durability== Neoloy Geocells are a non- corrosive, inert engineering thermoplastic resistant to extreme environmental conditions, heat, cold, water, wind and dust. Effective service temperature is -60 ¬∞C to +60 ¬∞C, and they have been used in environments from deserts to saturated peat bogs to arctic tundra. Special additives and manufacturing processes provide Neoloy Geocells with long-term environmental durability from UV radiation / oxidation, during outdoor storage, installation and long-term project design-life. ==See also== * Cellular Confinement Systems (geocells) * Route TRIDENT * Geosynthetics ==References== Category:Geosynthetics ","title":"Neoloy Geocell"},{"id":"61335886","text":"Mari Griffith (1940‚Äì2019) was a Welsh radio announcer, as well as a singer, presenter, independent producer and novelist later on in life. Griffith was born to a Welsh-speaking family in Maesteg, the Llynfi Valley with a passion for music. She first appeared on All Your Own, a Sunday night BBC children's television programme, direct from London, singing with accompaniment by her harpist sister Anne. Griffith said about her childhood \\"Few people in Maesteg had TV sets in those days, so they all crowded into each other's houses to watch. They then crept shamefacedly into chapel late for the evening service, hoping the minister wouldn't notice.\\" In the mid-1960s she left Maesteg and went to college in Cardiff, later joining the Manchester-based BBC Northern Singers. She divided her time between presenting children's programmes and attending folk music concerts. She gained her own BBC Wales series, With A little Help. Griffith sung in both English and Welsh. After returning home, she worked with comedians Ryan and Ronnie, and Max Boyce, along with appearances on Disc a Dawn, Poems and Pints, and Music for your Pleasure. She took up work as a bilingual continuity announcer at BBC Wales. After starting with promotional work, she established her own production company, MovieJack. Moviejack filmed in the US and Bulgaria. Throughout her life, Griffith worked in the RTS and spent more than ten years as the secretary of the Wales Centre Committee. When she grew older, she started writing and successfully published two medieval romance novels, Root of the Tudor Rose and its sequel, The Witch of Eye. Griffith died on May 13, 2019, at Bridgend, at the age of 79. ==Root of the Tudor Rose== Root of the Tudor Rose is a 2014 historical novel written by Mari Griffith. It concerns Queen Catherine of Valois, widowed at 21 by the premature death of her husband King Henry V, shortly after which her father King Charles VI of France dies too. Catherine is now left adrift at the English court, defending her 10-month old son from political rivals, such as the ambitious Duke of Gloucester, who seeks the throne for himself. She manages to form a friendship with a young Welsh servant, Owen ap Maredudd ap Tudur. Gradually their friendship deepens, but as a widowed queen, Catherine is not allowed to marry another man, certainly not a servant. The book became a Number 1 best seller and became the Welsh Books Council's Book of the Month for July 2015. Griffith explained that her aim in writing the book was to explore the Welsh ancestry of the Tudor dynasty, stemming from Owen Tudor himself. The book was followed by a 2016 sequel, The Witch of Eye. == References == Category:Welsh radio presenters Category:Welsh singers Category:Welsh television presenters Category:Welsh novelists Category:1940 births Category:2019 deaths ","title":"Mari Griffith"},{"id":"61335950","text":"Donald Whitney Thompson (August 18, 1937 ‚Äì July 17, 2019) was a film director, producer and screenwriter of Christian films.

It is scored for five soloists (SATB and a baritone), mixed chorus and orchestra. A performance lasts about 62‚Äì75 minutes. ==History== Began in October 1835 to commemorate the death of Donizetti's friend and rival Vincenzo Bellini in Naples, the work was left unfinished (probably due to composer unable to conduct it in December, because he was not in the city). It was published in 1870 by Lucca in a vocal with organ arrangement. The first known performance took place the same year in Donizetti's native Bergamo, in the basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore, under Alessandro Nini. It was repeated in 1875 on the occasion of the translation of the remains of Donizetti and his teacher Simon Mayr to Santa Maria Maggiore; then on the centenary of Donizetti's birth (1897) and death (1948, under Gianandrea Gavazzeni). The manuscript is preserved in the Conservatorio di San Pietro a Majella (Naples). In 1974 Vilmos Lesk√≥ prepared a new Ricordi edition of the Requiem, and since then it came to be regarded as one of the most important non-operatic compositions by Donizetti.

His father Hamda was a stevedore on the harbors of the commercial port. Admired by trade union leader Farhat Hached, Hamda participated in the colonial port's social movements. He took an active part in setting up obstacles obstructing the Bizert Canal during the Bizerte crisis. That was when he lost his second son Mekki.

This episode is tragically experienced by the son who cannot mourn for his father and seeks, among other things by means of the book, to pay him the homage he did not do. The book, which takes the form of a set of letters, retraces in a first part the history of the neighborhood where the Fliss family lived as well as that of the city of Bizerte. This ends, particularly, on the episode of the Bizerte crisis in which the family lost one of his sons. Subsequently, the book goes back to the author's prison experience and the various vicissitudes encountered by the father during this period.

She won the World Ladies Snooker Championship in 1987, at the age of 16, and was runner-up in 1988 and 1999. ==Biography== Farren started playing aged seven, on a 4ft by 2ft snooker table that her father Hugh bought her. She left Chilwell Comprehensive School with one O-level, having prioritized snooker above her studies, and went into snooker as a career. She prepared for the 1987 world championship by practicing on a ¬£4,000 table her father installed for her in a specially built room in the garden. 56 players participated in the 1987 tournament. Farren progressed through to the final, where she played Stacey Hillyard. Farren achieved a 5‚Äì1 victory to take the prize of ¬£3,500 and the trophy, plus a double magnum of champagne that she was not old enough to drink, being only 16 years and 48 days old at the time. She was the second- youngest champion, the youngest being her beaten opponent Hillyard, who had won at the age of 15 in 1984. Farren was runner-up in the world championship in 1988 and 1989, losing both times to Allison Fisher, who was regarded as the dominant player of the era. When the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association opened membership for events to anyone over the age of 16 in 1990, Farren was one of six women to join, along with Allison Fisher, Stacey Hillyard, Georgina Aplin, Karen Corr, and Maureen McCarthy, whilst 443 men joined at the same time. Farren once modelled waistcoats alongside 1985 World champion Dennis Taylor on The Clothes Show. She started a media studies course at Newark and Sherwood College in 1994, with ambitions to become a journalist, and later joined the UK civil service. ==Titles and achievements== {  ! Outcome !!

Penrith coach Len Stacker gave Wolffe his first grade debut on the wing in his sides' 33-7 loss to the Newtown Jets at Penrith Park in round 14 of the 1979 season. He scored his first try in his sides' 19-8 loss to the Eastern Suburbs Roosters at Penrith Park in round 20 of the 1979 season. The early 1980s was a troubled period for the Panthers. They went on to finish with the wooden spoon in the 1980 season after winning only 2 games. In 1981, the Panthers won eight games and went on to finish 11th. Panthers coach Len Stacker was subsequently sacked from the coaching role at the end of the 1981 season. In 1982, John Peard replaced Stacker as head coach. Wolffe had his best season at the Panthers in the 1982 season when he finished the season with 8 tries, second only to Panthers newcomer Brad Izzard with nine. Despite these efforts, the Panthers went on to finish the 1982 season in 12th position. Peard's stint as coach ended at the conclusion of the 1983 season. In 1984, former Panthers player Tim Sheens took over the coaching role. The Panthers were a much more formidable outfit under Sheens' coaching. For the first time the club's history, they looked like making their first ever finals appearance in the 1984 season, when with just two rounds to go, they'd won 12 games, and were in 5th position, but they lost their last two games to the Canberra Raiders and Parramatta Eels in round 25 and 26 respectively, and subsequently missed out on finals qualification. The Panthers would eventually be finalists in the 1985 season. They defeated the Manly Sea Eagles 10‚àí7 in the playoff for fifth spot, but a few days later, they lost 38‚àí6 to the Parramatta Eels at the SCG. This was Wolffe's lone appearance in a finals match. Wolffe's stint with Panthers ended at the conclusion of the 1986 season. In 1987, Wolffe shifted to arch rivals and defending premiers the Parramatta Eels. He made only eight appearances with the Eels, before announcing his retirement at season's end. He finished his career having played 111 games, and scoring 31 tries. ==References== Category:1958 births Category:Australian rugby league players Category:Penrith Panthers players Category:Parramatta Eels players Category:People from Sydney Category:Rugby league players from New South Wales Category:Rugby league centres Category:Rugby league wingers Category:Living people ","title":"Ken Wolffe"},{"id":"61336094","text":"Anastasiya Kirpichnikova (born 24 June 2000) is a Russian swimmer.

He inherited a number of estates and properties from his father on the latter's death in 1409, but the one he coveted, Bothal Castle, had already gone to his younger brother. Robert, however, managed to obtain possession of it by a combination of force and cunning. He was elected to Parliament as knight of the shire to represent Northumberland in March 1416, 1419, 1420, December 1421, 1425 and 1435 and was pricked High Sheriff of Northumberland for 1417‚Äì18. He was appointed Constable of Wark Castle, Northumberland by 1419, of Berwick-upon-Tweed by 1423 to 1426, and Roxburgh by 1425 to his death in 1426. He married in 1399 Maud, the daughter of Sir Thomas Gray, with whom he had 3 sons and 4 daughters. He was succeeded by his eldest son Robert , who was created a baron. ==References== Category:1436 deaths Category:English MPs 1419 Category:English MPs 1420 Category:English MPs 1425 Category:English MPs 1435 Category:High Sheriffs of Northumberland Category:Knights Bachelor Category:Year of birth uncertain ","title":"Robert Ogle (MP)"},{"id":"61336204","text":"Ram√≥n Almengor a.k.a.

After dropping out of school, he started rapping in 2001 and then attended the music contest Akademi T√ºrkiye broadcast by atv television channel. Initially asked to sing pop music in the Akademi Turkiye contest, Ender refused to comply with the competition's request. Eventually, the Akademi introduced a rap course into its programme. Ender began a group with Erman Altƒ±noƒülu, known as Ender & Erman or Erman & Ender. After completing his military service, in 2010 Ender made a solo rap album called Inside Patlar. In 2012, he announced that he would release a new album. He gave concerts in ƒ∞zmir, Diyarbakƒ±r and Ankara to promote this album and started using the stage name Norm Ender for his solo releases. Ender became known on social media for his song \\"Eksik Etek\\". This song received about 40 million plays on YouTube in one month, making him the 17th most listened to Turkish artist of 2006. After a 5-year break from music, in 2016 Ender announced a new album under the EMI- Universal Music Turkey label. In July 2019, Ender returned with the track \\"Mekanƒ±n Sahibi\\" (Owner of the Venue), which satirised the Turkish rap scene and specifically took aim at rappers like Ezhel and Ben Fero, calling them 'babies', and featuring a chorus that aimed to establish Ender's dominance over newer and younger rappers: \\"The owner of the venue is back, let's take the babies off the track\\". In November 2019, the song was taken down by Spotify due to alleged copyright violations. The song was again restored on Spotify in the same month. == Discography  Albums === {  !Year !Album !Details - 2010 Enderground His first underground album, which he produced and released himself between 2002 and 2009. - 2010 ƒ∞√ßinde Patlar A video for \\"ƒ∞√ßinde Patlar\\" was released in 2010.

It had its origins in a Volunteer unit of the Royal Engineers (RE) formed in the 1890s. It provided the divisional signals for the 44th (Home Counties) Division and its duplicates in both World Wars, also seeing active service with 28th Division in World War I. Its successor continued in the postwar TA and Army Reserve. ==Origin== When the Volunteer Force was subsumed into the new Territorial Force (TF) under the Haldane Reforms in 1908, the former 1st Sussex Engineer Volunteer Corps provided the divisional engineers for the TF's Home Counties Division, including the Home Counties Divisional Telegraph Company with the following organisation:Westlake, p. 13.Lord & Watson, pp. 152‚Äì4.Morling, pp. 19 & 249.Nalder, p. 598.Monthly Army List, various dates.London Gazette', 20 March 1908. * Company Headquarters at 23 Gloucester Place, Brighton * No 1 Section at Brighton * No 2 (Surrey) Section * No 3 (Kent) Section * No 4 (Middlesex) Section Nos 2‚Äì4 Sections were attached to and largely manned by the three infantry brigades of the division. The Telegraph Company was redesignated a Signal Company in 1911. ==World War IMobilisation=== The Signal Company had been with the Home Counties Division on Salisbury Plain for its annual training when the order came to mobilise on 4 August 1914. The unit returned to Brighton and was embodied the following day. Shortly afterwards, TF units were invited to volunteer for overseas service. Early in September battalions of the Home Counties Division began to relieve Regular units at Gibraltar, then in October the infantry and artillery of the whole division embarked for garrison service in India. Although it did later receive a number (44th), the Home Counties Division never operated as a formation during the war: its units remained scattered in colonial garrisons or were attached to Indian divisions. The Divisional RE remained in England to support Regular formations: the Signal Company joined the 28th Division, which was forming at Winchester primarily from units returned from service in India.Becke, Pt 2a, pp. 49‚Äì54.44 Division at Long, Long Trail.Morling, p. 35. On 31 August, the formation of a reserve or 2nd Line unit was authorised for each 1st Line unit where 60 per cent or more of the men had volunteered for Overseas Service. The titles of these 2nd Line units would be the same as the original, but distinguished by a '2' prefix. In this way duplicate battalions, brigades and divisions were created, mirroring those TF formations being sent overseas. Later 3rd Line units were formed to supply drafts to the 1st and 2nd Lines.Becke, Pt 2b, p. 6. Formation sign of the 28th Division, a strip of red cloth on the shoulder strap. ===1st Home Counties Signal Company=== 1st Home Counties Signal Company joined 28th Division at Winchester on 5 January 1915 and provided its communications until beyond the end of the war.Becke, Pt 1, pp. 106‚Äì16.Lord & Watson, p. 222. The division embarked at Southampton 15‚Äì18 January, disembarking at Le Havre 16‚Äì19 January, and concentrated between Bailleul and Hazebrouck by 22 January. While on the Western Front it participated in the following actions: * Battle of Gravenstafel Ridge (22‚Äì23 April) * Battle of St Julien (24 April‚Äì4 May) * Battle of Frezenberg Ridge (8‚Äì13 May) * Battle of Bellewaarde Ridge (24‚Äì25 May) * Battle of Loos (27 September‚Äì5 October) At noon on 19 October 1915 the division was ordered to leave for an unknown destination within 48 hours. The Signals Company entrained on 20 October, embarked at Marseille on 24 October and arrived at Alexandria in Egypt on 29 October. The division then embarked again for the Macedonian front, the Signal Company arriving at Salonika on 16 December 1915, joining the division on the River Struma. An RE Signal Company at work on the Western Front. 28th Division spent the rest of the war on this front, where there were few major actions, but the troops suffered steady attrition through trench warfare casualties and sickness. A year after its arrival it took part in the occupation of Mazirko and the capture of Bairakli Jum'a. In May 1917 it captured Ferdie and Essex Trenches near Bairakli Jum'a, and in October it captured Nairakli and Kumli. Finally, on 18 and 19 September 1918, 28th Division took part in the Battle of Doiran and the subsequent pursuit of the defeated Bulgarian Army up the Strumica Valley. On 29 September Bulgaria concluded the Armistice of Salonica with the Allies. This was followed a month later by the Armistice of Mudros with the Turks. Early in November the 28th Division was sent to occupy Constantinople and the Dardanelles Forts, with Divisional HQ at Chanak (√áanakkale). 28th Division remained in these positions, though its units (including 28th Divisional Signal Company of the new Royal Corps of Signals) were progressively manned by Regulars after the remaining TF men were demobilised. In July 1922, 28th Division was moved to interpose between the Greek and Turkish armies (the Chanak Crisis). After a ceasefire was arranged, the British troops were progressively reduced. On 2 October 1923 the final evacuation took place, and 28th Division was disbanded. ===2nd Home Counties Signal Company=== 2nd Home Counties Signal Co was formed at Brighton and the 2nd Home Counties Division began to assemble around Windsor in November 1914. There was a shortage of equipment with which to train ‚Äì only a few old .256-in Japanese Ariska rifles were available. In July 1915 the units had to be reorganised as TF men who had only signed up for Home Service were transferred to Home Defence brigades (termed Provisional Brigades). A few Home Counties men probably joined 9th Provisional Signal Section in 9th Provisional Brigade, formed in Kent predominantly from East Lancashire units. The 2nd HC Division was redesignated 67th (2nd Home Counties) Division in August 1915 and the signal company became 67th (2nd HC) Signal Co. In November the division became part of Second Army, Central Force, and was quartered in Kent, the Signal Co HQ located with divisional HQ (DHQ) at Canterbury. On 19 January 1916 the sections left to join their respective brigades.Becke, Pt 2b, pp. 75‚Äì82.Morling, pp. 36‚Äì7. 67th (2nd HC) Division had the dual role of home defence and supplying drafts to units serving overseas. It was twice warned for service in Ireland and in April 1917 for service on the Western Front, but these deployments never materialised and the division spent the whole war in England. During the winter of 1917‚Äì18 the division moved to Essex, where it joined XXIII Corps. DHQ and Signals were at Colchester. The units maintained these dispositions until after the Armistice with Germany, when demobilisation began. In March 1919 the remaining RE units began to disband, and the process was soon completed. ==Royal Signals== When the TF was reconstituted as the Territorial Army (TA) in 1920‚Äì1, a new 44th (Home Counties) Divisional Signals was formed by the newly-formed Royal Corps of Signals (RCS). It combined the former 44th (HC) Signal Company, RE, with 10th Battalion, Middlesex Regiment. Headquarters was at Stamford Brook Lodge, Ravenscourt Park, West London (the former HQ of the 10th Middlesex), with 2 Company at Brighton and sections at New Southgate, Chatham and Hurstpierpoint. By the 1930s, 44th (HC) Signals also administered: * 226th Field Artillery Signal Section, Drill Hall, Gloucester Road, Brighton * 227th Field Artillery Signal Section, Drill Hall, Hurstpierpoint, later at Drill Hall, Bognor Regis * 203rd Medium Artillery Signal Section, Fort Pitt, Chatham The 4th Cadet Battalion of the Middlesex Regiment was also attached to the unit. ==World War IIMobilisation=== Following the Munich Crisis the TA was doubled in size. Once again, 44th (HC) Division formed a duplicate, 12th (Eastern) Division, with its own divisional signals. 44th (HC) Division was mobilised on 3 September 1939 and 12th (E) Division became active on 7 October 1939.Eastern Command 3 September 1939 at Patriot Files.Joslen, pp. 71‚Äì2.Joslen, p. 56. 44th (Home Counties) Division's formation sign. ===44th (Home Counties) Divisional Signals=== 44th (HC) Division embarked for France on 1 April 1940 to join the new British Expeditionary Force (BEF). Dunkirk When the German offensive in the west opened on 10 May, the BEF advanced into Belgium in accordance with 'Plan D'. 44th (HC) Division moved up to the Escaut, where it was in reserve.Ellis, France & Flanders, Chapter III. However, the German Army broke through the Ardennes to the east, forcing the BEF to withdraw again, and by 19 May the whole force was back across the Escaut.Ellis, France & Flanders, Chapter IV. 44th (HC) Division tried to hold the most dangerous point, but the Germans established bridgeheads across the Escaut at dawn on 20 May. The attack was renewed on 22 May and the division was badly chewed up, but there was no breakthrough: it was the deep penetration further east that forced the BEF to withdraw. Next day the BEF fell back to the 'Canal Line', and 44th (HC) Division was withdrawn into reserve.Ellis, France & Flanders, Chapter V.Ellis, France & Flanders, Chapter VI.Ellis, France & Flanders, Chapter VII.Ellis, France & Flanders, Chapter VIII. Royal Signals erecting cable poles in France, 1940. Cut off, the BEF fell back towards the coast, with 44th (HC) Division given the responsibility of defending the area round Hazebrouck. On 26 May the decision was made to evacuate the BEF through Dunkirk (Operation Dynamo). 44th (HC) Division was heavily attacked by German Panzer divisions on 27 May, but fought on doggedly until ordered to withdraw, by which time the enemy's advanced columns had penetrated between its widely-spread units. With its flanks 'in the air' after neighbouring French formations retreated during the night of 28/29 May, the divisional commander decided to withdraw some to Mont des Cats, a strong position held by the divisional artillery and some of the divisional RE acting as infantry, though only DHQ and scattered elements reached the Mont by dawn to join them. This rearguard was subjected to intense mortar fire next morning, then by dive-bombing, but held its position for 30 hours while the rest of the division withdrew. The remnants of the division reached the beaches for embarkation, reaching England on 1 June.Ellis, France & Flanders, Chapter IX.Ellis, France & Flanders, Chapter XI.Ellis, France & Flanders, Chapter XII.Ellis, France & Flanders, Chapter XIII.Ellis, France & Flanders, Chapter XIV. Home Defence On return to England, 44th (HC) Division was briefly in Southern Command, then until October in North East England with I Corps before returning to invasion-threatened South East England with XII Corps. In April 1942 the division came under War Office control preparatory to going overseas, and on 29 May it embarked for Egypt. North Africa 44th (HC) Division arrived in Egypt on 24 July, shortly after Eighth Army had retreated to the El Alamein position. On 15 August it was assigned to XIII Corps before General Rommel attacked the El Alamein line (the Battle of Alam el Halfa). The division held the Alam Halfa ridge when the attack came in on 30 August. Over the next two days the Panzers made repeated attacks but 44th (HC) Division held its position and by 3 September the division was counter-attacking.Playfair, Vol III, pp. 384‚Äì90. For Eighth Army's counter-offensive (the Second Battle of Alamein), 44th (HC) Division was to lead one of XIII Corps' thrusts through the enemy minefields on the first night, 23/24 October (Operation Lightfoot). A route was found through the first belt of minefields ('January') on the first night and 44th (HC) Division succeeded in passing the second minefield ('February') the next night, but the armour was unable to exploit beyond.Joslen, p. 570.Playfair & Molony, Vol IV, pp. 42‚Äì3, 46‚Äì7. The second phase of the offensive, Operation Supercharge, was launched on the night of 27/28 October. Eventually, the armour broke though, and next day came signs that the enemy was withdrawing. 44th (HC) Division took some part in the pursuit to El Agheila, collecting prisoners, but XIII Corps was short of transport and was left behind as Eighth Army drove westwards. Shortly afterwards 44th (HC) Division HQ was disbanded, and its units distributed.Playfair & Molony, Vol IV, pp. 92‚Äì3; 220. The personnel of 44th (HC) Divisional Signals were used to reinforce XXX Corps Signals, 7th Armoured Division Signals and No 4 Line of Communication (LoC) Signals. 12th (Eastern) Divisional sign. ===12th (Eastern) Divisional Signals=== In April 1940 three of the new duplicate TA divisions under training, including 12th (E) Division, were sent to France to act as labour troops to work on airfields and LoCs. Elements of the divisional signal unit went to France for the LoCs, but not the complete unit.Ellis, France & Flanders, Chapter II. On 17 May, after the BEF was forced to withdraw from the Dyle Line, 12th (E) Division was ordered to concentrate in the neighbourhood of Amiens. The infantry only had their personal small arms, and meagre artillery support had to be improvised. The following day the division was covering the important traffic centres of Albert, Doullens, Amiens and Abbeville together with two equally ill-equipped brigades of 23rd (Northumbrian) Division, all under the commander of 12th (E) Division, Maj-Gen R.L Petre and known as 'Petreforce'. Petreforce at the time was the only thing between seven advancing Panzer divisions and the sea. The raw Territorials held up the German advance for 5 hours, allowing the BEF to continue its retreat towards Dunkirk.Butler & Bradford, pp. 96‚Äì7, 106. The survivors of 12th (E) Division then made their way to the coast and got out of France through Dunkirk and other evacuation ports, the division finally reaching England on 8 June. Its casualties were so severe that it was broken up on 10 July, with the divisional signals sending reinforcements to 44th (HC) Signals and 1 Army Signal Training Regiment in the UK and to the Middle East, including No 3 LoC Signals and Sudan Signals. ==Postwar== When the TA was reconstituted in 1947, the unit reformed at Gillingham, Kent, as 44 (Home Counties) Divisional Signal Regiment with the following organisation: * Regimental HQ at Stamford Brook * 1 Squadron at Stamford Brook * 2 Squadron at Brighton * 3 Squadron at Chatham In 1957, 2 Sqn moved to Bromley, but E, F and G Troops remained at Brighton and a new K troop was formed at Richmond-upon- Thames. When the TA was reorganised in 1961, the division became 44th (Home Counties) Division/District and the regiment absorbed the district signal unit, 62 (Mixed) Signal Regiment (Cinque Ports). This had been formed in Anti- Aircraft Command in 1947 as 11th AA (Mixed) Signal Rgt from elements of the wartime 1 and 2 AA Group Signals. The subtitle 'Mixed' indicated that members of the Women's Royal Army Corps were integrated into the unit. After AA Command was disbanded in 1955 the regiment merged with 259 (Mixed) Heavy Anti- Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery, (Home Counties) (Cinque Ports). Based at Shorncliffe, the unit was numbered as 62 Signal Rgt in 1959 and adopted the 'Cinque Ports' subtitle the following year. The merged regiment also took this historic title, as 44 (Home Counties) Signal Regiment (Cinque Ports)Nalder, pp. 617‚Äì8. The merged regiment also took on administrative responsibility for two brigade signal sqns in 44 (HC) Division:Lord & Watson, p. 205. * 329 Sqn formed in 1959 at Bromley from 131 (Surrey) Infantry Bde Signals * 330 Sqn formed in 1959 at Tunbridge Wells from 133 (Kent & Sussex) Infantry Bde Signals When the TA was reduced into the Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve (TAVR) in 1967 the regiment became a single squadron (44 (Cinque Ports) Sqn) at Gillingham in 36 (Eastern) Signal Regiment. In March 1969 it formed 858 (Corps) Trp at Eastbourne and 859 Trp at Ilford, which moved to Eastbourne in 1970. The role of these Trps was to reinforce the Regular 22 Signal Rgt in British Army of the Rhine. These two Trps combined on 30 November 1977 to reform the disbanded 56 Signal Sqn.Lord & Watson, pp 168‚Äì70. In 1992 44 Sqn's HQ moved to Grays, Essex, and a sub-unit was formed at Prittlewell, Southend-on-Sea, from a troop from 70 (Essex Yeomanry) Signal Sqn, a platoon of 10th Battalion, Parachute Regiment, and part of 215 Transport Sqn, Royal Corps of Transport, giving the following organisation: * SHQ at Grays * 747 and 748 Trps at Grays * 746 and 749 Trps at Prittlewell Under the Strategic Review of Reserves in 2009, 36 (Eastern) Signal Rgt was reduced to 36 (Essex Yeomanry) Signal Sqn at Colchester, including 844 (Cinque Ports) Signal Troop. ==Commanding Officers== Unit commanders included the following: Home Counties Divisional Signal Co, RE: * Capt H.C.

Mezban (locally known as Mejjan) is one of the popular social festival of the Chittagong region in Bangladesh. The word \\"Mezban\\" in Persian means host and \\"Mezbani\\" means hosting or arranging a feast for the guests. Historically Mezbani is a traditional regional feast where people are invited to enjoy a meal with white rice and beef, besides a ton of other dishes are also served such as curry of Mung Bean, Liver Fry, etc. that depends on the event to event was held on the occasions such as death anniversary, birth anniversary, own successes, launching of a new business, entry into a new house, the birth of a sought after child in a family, marriage, aqiqah and circumcision, ear piercing of girls and naming of the newborn. The invitation of the Mezban ceremony generally remains open for all and various people to different places and neighborhoods convey the invitation for the feast. The invitation cards are printed and distributed among the guests only in urban areas. Usually, the consumption of food at Mezbani takes place from morning to afternoon. ==Etymology and history== Mezban is commonly called Mejjan in the local language of Chittagong. In the neighbouring Noakhali region of Chittagong, Mezbani is popular and widely known as Zeafat. Various poets and litterateurs from Chittagong region have composed numerous rhymes, poems, stories, and essays on the theme of Mezban, such as: :\\"Kalamanya Dhalamanya :Aner Ada Jira Dhanya :Ar Na Lagey Ilish-Ghanya :Goru Khashi Butor Dailor :Bosta Dekha Jay ‚Äì :Mezbani Khati Ay‚Ä¶.\\" ==Cooking techniques== Mezban cooking in Chittagong Traditionally Mezban is a beef-dominated meal and a symbol of social prestige. The rich and the poor arrange feasts on various occasions as much as circumstances allow them. It has a prominent style of cooking and proper Mezban meat demands a certain skill; for example: # Spicy beef cooked with a lot of red chilies # Less hot but sour and spicy broth made from the tubular bone of a cow, which is known as Nawla kanji # A kind of pulse which is cooked after peeling the skin of beans and then crushing them; it is called Bhuna dal # Food of slightly pungent taste made from chick-pea pulse, bone, fat, and meat. ==Hindu tradition== In the middle of the 18th century, Shamsher Gazi, who was a governor in the northern region of Chittagong (past Islamabad) in Feni district and Zamindar of Tripura, Chakla-Roshnabad dug a large pond after the name of his mother Koyara Begum and arranged a feast by bringing many fish from the neighboring ponds as well as those in Nizampur area of Chittagong. Fish is used instead of beef while cooking Mezban in Hindu tradition. Since the Hindu community of Chittagong organises Mezbani each year under the banner of \\"Chittagong Parishad\\", with curries made from fish, vegetable and dried fish. ==Celebrations== Mezban is now popular cuisine all over the country. The practice of Mezbani started in the capital city Dhaka in the late 60s, when National Professor Nurul Islam became the president of Chittagong Association, Dhaka for the term of 1968 to 1983. It has also proliferated in Sylhet, Khulna, and various countries of Europe, Americas, and Asia. ==References== Category:Culture in Chittagong Category:Chittagonian cuisine ","title":"Mezban"},{"id":"61336402","text":"Daria Andreyevna Vaskina (; born 30 July 2002) is a Russian swimmer.

The Prince Edward Fracture Zone (PEFZ) is one of the fracture zones located on the Southwest Indian Ridge in the Indian Ocean between Africa and Antarctica. The PEFZ is located west of Prince Edward Islands. The history of seafloor spreading between Africa and Antarctica since the breakup of Gondwana can be traced using magnetic anomaly lineations between the Mozambique Channel and the seafloor of Dronning Maud Land. Before the 1980s it was assumed that this spreading occurred continuously for 80 million years, from the Cretaceous to present, along the fracture zones flanking the mid- ocean ridge. In the mid-80s new magnetic lineations discovered near the PEFZ made it clear that a change in the spreading direction occurred 74‚Äì56 Ma.As the direction of spreading changed so did the phase. The largest offset along the Southwest Indian Ridge () is located west of the PEFZ and east of the Du Toit Fracture Zone (45¬∞S, 35¬∞E; 53¬∞S, 27¬∞E).

As his mother was Jewish, his father could not find any work under National Socialist regime. His father found a position at the school of Kees Boeke in Bilthoven. Later, Hermann von der Dunk visited the nearby University of Utrecht. There, he studied history under professor Pieter Geyl and later studied at the Leibniz Institute of European History in Mainz. In 1966 he finished his dissertation (in German) on \\"Der Deutsche Vorm√§rz und Belgien, 1930-1948\\" (\\"The German Vorm√§rz and Belgium, 1830-1848\\"). One year later, in 1967, von der Dunk became professor for modern and contemporary history as well as cultural history at the University of Utrecht and stayed in this position until 1990. His early retirement was (at least in part) a reaction to the commercialization and bureaucratization of the universities. He specialized in European and Dutch history, as well as Dutch-German relationships. Much of his work focused on \\"modernity and anti-modern responses\\", he wrote several monographs and regularly published articles in Dutch newspapers and journals.

The term SEC has now been adopted by several scientists. ==In vertebrates== The term \\"scavenger endothelial cell\\", first appearing in the scientific literature in 1999, was coined to distinguish a highly specialized subclass of endothelium in vertebrates that was observed to express a remarkably avid blood clearance activity. Blood borne waste macromolecules are known to be efficiently cleared from the blood circulation via scavenger receptors (stabilin-1, stabilin-2), the mannose receptor, and the Fc gamma receptor IIb2 of the mammalian liver sinusoidal endothelial cells. Ligands that are efficiently cleared from blood by receptor-mediated endocytosis in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells in mammals, are also avidly cleared by liver sinusoidal endothelial cells in birds, reptiles and amphibia, as in mammals. However, in bony fish (teleosts) the same macromolecules accumulate in either heart endocardium (e.g. in the Atlantic cod) or kidney sinusoids (e.g. in carp and salmonid fishes), but not in liver. Furthermore, in animal species of phylogenetically older vertebrate classes, i.e. cartilaginous (e.g. ray) and jawless (lamprey and hagfish) fishes, only specialized endothelial cells in gills exhibit the same active blood clearance capability as observed in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells in the four land-based vertebrate classes. In all these cases the clearance cells are not macrophages, but a special type of endothelial cells that have been named scavenger endothelial cells to distinguish them functionally from other types of vertebrate endothelia. Recently is was shown that the endothelial cells in the caudal vein plexus of the embryonic zebrafish, also exhibit characteristic scavenger functions. These SECs, but not macrophages, avidly and preferentially clear colloidal waste and viral particles, as well as endogenous exosomes that are specifically internalized in a dynamin- and scavenger receptor dependent pathway to be targeted to lysosomes for degradation. Anionic nanoparticles are primarily taken up by these zebrafish SECs by the scavenger receptor, stabilin-2 in this process, which is also a signature scavenger receptor of mammalian liver sinusoidal endothelial cells. ==Analogues in invertebrates== Although true endothelial cells are only found in vertebrates, insect hemocytes and nephrocytes have similar scavenger functions to vertebrate macrophages and SECs, sharing the task of waste clearance and defense against foreign intruders. Colloidal vital dyes, such as ammonia carmine and trypan blue, are rapidly and preferentially taken up by insect pericardial and garland nephrocytes. Nephrocytes, but not hemocytes of the common blow fly (Calliphora) avidly endocytose and degrade ligands that are also recognized by stabilin-2 of mammalian scavenger endothelial cells. In Drosophila, nephrocytes remove microbiota-derived peptidoglycan from systemic circulation to maintain immune homeostasis. Nephrocytes that strongly resemble insect nephrocytes are found in several other major invertebrate classes. ==The dual-cell principle of waste clearance== It appears that the major scavenger cell systems of vertebrates and invertebrates are based on a dual- cell principle of waste clearance. In vertebrates, distinct populations of scavenger endothelial cells represent the professional pinocyte, clearing the blood of a wide range of soluble macromolecules and small particles (<200 nm) by clathrin-mediated endocytosis, while the macrophage represents the professional phagocyte, eliminating larger particles (>200 nm). == See also == * Endothelial cell * Invertebrates * Reticuloendothelial system * Vertebrates == References == Category:Tissues (biology) ","title":"Scavenger endothelial cell"},{"id":"61337208","text":"Henry's Hard Soda is a Molson Coors line of hard sodas, made with cane sugar, that are 4.2 percent alcohol by volume. The brand was created with fun in mind, and inspired by Henry Weinhard, a \\"quirky, fun-loving\\" German-American brewer who opened a brewery in Portland in 1862. Due to the company's marketing muscle, Henry's Hard Soda was considered a serious competitor to the category leader, Not Your Father's Root Beer. The marketing campaign included advertising on primetime networks and high-profile cable partners such as ABC, FOX, TBS, Food Network, and Bravo, along with a custom digital presence in top pop culture sites, traditional print media support, dual-language public relations programming and influencer initiatives. The company noted the breakout success of its flavored malt beverage (FMB) Redd's Apple Ale in 2014. Bryan Ferschinger, MillerCoors senior director of innovation said, \\"FMB is something that has established itself and continues to grow, and we really believe that hard soda is the next segment to evolve.\\" Henry's was able to obtain the No. 1 slot in the flavored malt-beverage segment with 24 percent of the market, prompting the company to expand its offerings with a new cherry cola flavor, backed by a multipronged ad campaign, with Ferschinger noting, \\"We're keeping the foot on the gas.\\" ==Marketing== The hard sodas were marketed toward the Generation X and millennial generation audiences due to their affinity for soda, with Ferschinger remarking, \\"We know Gen-Xers have stuff to do tomorrow, which is why we created Henry's Hard Soda. Henry's provides just the right amount of fun, helping people embrace their 'Live Hard-ish' lifestyle.\\" In particular, the company sought to appeal to young parents. The company commission Mekanism to produce a commercial with the \\"Live Hard-ish\\" tagline, in which a group of Gen-Xers are drinking hard-ish beverages and cheering while watching a sports game when they suddenly subdue themselves upon hearing a baby crying on the baby monitor. In another commercial, the \\"-ish\\" part of the \\"hard-ish\\" is emphasized when a man puts a coaster under his drink, and slogans like \\"GO BUCKMILD\\", \\"RAISE HECK\\", and \\"PARTY SOME OF THE NIGHT LONG\\" appear, alongside other symbols of the live hard-ish lifestyle, such as medium salsa and high-SPF sunblock. ==Henry's Hard Sparkling== In 2017, Henry's Hard Soda released Henry's Hard Sparkling, debuting with Hard Sparkling Lemon Lime and Hard Sparkling Passion Fruit, with Josh Wexelbaum, MillerCoors marketing director for Henry's Hard Sparkling saying, \\"Henry's Hard Sparkling is perfect for those looking to treat themselves, lightly.

She is best known for her wrestling career, where she competed in both All Japan Women's Pro Wrestling (AJW) and Hyper Visual Fighting Arsion under her maiden name. == Professional wrestling career  All Japan Women's Pro Wrestling (1993‚Äì1997) === Fukawa was an amateur wrestler during her high school years and applied to join the All Japan Women's Pro Wrestling dojo upon graduation in 1992 at the age of 17. She passed the tryout and was accepted, joining as the smallest wrestler on the entire roster at just barely 5 feet tall. Fukawa made her in ring debut at Korakuen Hall on November 12, 1993. In only her second professional match, however, Fukawa fractured her right clavicle and was forced to miss the rest of 1993 and all of 1994. She did however remain active during her absence, working for AJW as a referee and continuing to hone her wrestling skills in the dojo. Fukawa returned to the ring on January 13, 1995, teaming with Kayo Noumi in a loss to Mari Mogami and Yuka Shiina. Fukawa began to gain popularity for her looks, and soon after redebuting she formed the tag team TakaFumi with Rie Tamada. As TakaFumi, the two captured the AJW Tag Team Championship on March 17, 1995. They held the belts for 272 days, defending them well into 1996 until they lost to Chikayo Nagashima and Sugar Sato in September. Despite her popularity, Fukawa achieved little success in AJW outside of the tag division. She received one shot at the AJW Championship in February 1997, but lost to Rie Tamada. On August 20, Fukawa's longtime partner Rie Tamada announced she would follow Aja Kong in leaving AJW. Fukawa later announced her intention to do the same, and all three were gone from the company shortly after. === Arsion (1998‚Äì2000) === After leaving AJW, Aja Kong announced the formation of a new promotion, to be known as Hyper Visual Fighting Arsion. Both Fukawa and Tamada were two of the first to sign on, and Yumi wrestled on the debut show at Korakuen Hall, going to a time limit draw with Candy Okutsu in front of a sell out crowd. She took part in the Twin Stars of Arsion league in October 1998, teaming with Michiko Omukai. They defeated Mariko Yoshida and Mika Akino, but were eliminated by Ayako Hamada and Tiger Dream. She also joined Michiko Omukai's Vogue Impact Poison (V.I.P) stable along with Etsuko Mita and Mima Shimoda. In March 2000, she took part in the Battlarts/Arsion Kings and Queens tournament, a 6 man mixed tag team tournament teaming male wrestlers from Battlarts with female wrestlers from Arsion. Fukawa was teamed with Alexander Otsuka and Mariko Yoshida, and the trio was able to go on to win the tournament, beating Yuki Ishikawa, Ai Fujita and Candy Okutsu in the final. She also took part in the P-Mix Grand Prix, teaming with New Japan Pro Wrestling's Minoru Tanaka. They made it to the final, where they lost to Ayako Hamada and her father Gran Hamada. After a match on July 16, 2000, Fukawa visited a doctor who diagnosed her with an acute subdural hematoma and subarachnoid hemorrhage. After this, Fukawa became inactive and officially retired in March 2001, losing to Mariko Yoshida in her retirement match. === Post retirement === Since retiring from wrestling, Fukawa has worked as an actress and tarento, frequently appearing on television, commercials and radio to this day. She also began teaching a basic physical fitness class at the U-File Camp, a martial arts gym owned by MMA legend Kiyoshi Tamura. One of her first students was current professional wrestler Kazuhiro Tamura. In 2013, she began mentoring Mika Iida, a young wrestler who she offered to train. Iida debuted for Pro Wrestling Wave in 2013. == Personal life == Fukawa met fellow professional wrestler Minoru Tanaka through Arsion/Battlarts' working relationship in 2000, and they began dating shortly after. After Fukawa retired in 2001, the two became engaged in January 2002 and married in June of the same year.Áî∞‰∏≠Á®îÔºÜÂ∫úÂ∑ùÂîØÊú™„ÉªÂ©öÁ¥ÑÁô∫Ë°®Ë®òËÄÖ‰ºöË¶ã Êñ∞Êó•Êú¨„Éó„É≠„É¨„ÇπÂÖ¨Âºè„Çµ„Ç§„Éà 2002Âπ¥1Êúà18Êó•Á•ù!Áî∞‰∏≠Á®îÔºÜÂ∫úÂ∑ùÂîØÊú™ ÁµêÂ©ö!

They were constructed between 1708 and 1829, used for storage, squatted in the 1990s and are now converted into apartments. Entrepotdok is the largest inhabited warehouse complex in Amsterdam. The canal runs between the Kadijksplein and Sarphatistraat, and is parallel to Hoogte Kadijk, Laagte Kadijk, Plantage Doklaan and Natura Artis Magistra zoo. ==Location== The northwest end of the canal connects to the eastern end of the Nieuwe Herengracht canal. Halfway along its length the Entrepotdok is drained by the Entrepotdoksluis (a lock), which connects the center of the canal to the Nieuwe Vaart. The southeast end of the canal connects to the eastern end of the Plantage Muidergracht. The center of the warehouse complex can be reached from the northeast by the Pelikaanbrug across the Nieuwe Vaart canal. From the southwest it is accessible to bicyclists and pedestrians through a bridge from Kadijken. The Nijlpaardenbrug (bridge no. 1907; drawbridge for bicycle and foot traffic from 1987) connects the south of Entrepotdok street with the Plantage Kerklaan and the Plantage Doklaan . == History  Warehouses === The oldest warehouses of the complex were built after 1708. In 1827 the warehouses came into the possession of the state. During the French period in the Netherlands, import and export duties had to be paid for transit goods on the Amsterdam market . When Amsterdam experienced a lot of competition in the following period, the Algemeen Rijksentrepot (General Government Warehouse) was set up here in 1827 to stimulate the transit trade. Until 1895, goods could be stored temporarily in this warehouse without having to pay import duties (a type of bonded warehouse). They only had to pay duty when the goods were put on the market. The complex was completely walled off for this reason. A wall was built on the Laagte Kadijk and a gatehouse was built on Kadijksplein. Warehouses were also added: the middle part of the warehouses came into use between 1830 and 1840. The Entrepotdok has 84 monumental warehouses. They were built between 1708 and 1829. They gave the city of Amsterdam a storage space of up to 300,000m¬≥, close to the center. Due to the establishment of the Rijksentrepot, the bridge over the Rapenburgergracht (now: Entrepotdok) and the connection between Korte Kerkstraat (now Tussen Kadijken) and Nieuwe Kerkstraat also disappeared. The dock lost its function as a warehouse for undeclared goods around 1890 due to construction of the Nieuwe Entrepotdok on the Cruquiusweg, and the buildings were empty for a long time. The complex fell into the hands of the municipality. There were still a few companies on the lowest floors, but the complex was deteriorating rapidly and several warehouses were in poor condition. Much was demolished in the area, especially at Kattenburg, Wittenburg and Oostenburg, but the Entrepotdok was declared a national monument, and so was saved from demolition. === Conversion into apartments for social rental housing === Warehouses in 1981 during conversion to apartments After decades of financial tug-of-war, in the early 1980s, when Jan Schaefer was an alderman, a plan for reuse was developed by the municipality of Amsterdam (land company), the housing association De Dageraad and the architectural firm Van Stigt. Architect Joop van Stigt devised a plan to hollow out the interiors, so that in the very long, dark warehouse spaces, apartments could be situated around a communal central courtyard. This gives the houses enough sunlight. New business premises are situated on the ground floor and first floor. The cellars are used as storage, and after number 52 also as a parking garage and business premises. The first homes were delivered in 1984, in warehouses 79 through 84 (still from 1708) and in the last warehouse, number 13 (also from 1708) in 1989. Unlike any other social housing, the residents could participate in decisions about things like the design of the kitchen and bathroom. The inner courts have been given the street name Binnenkadijk. For the first homes, between 300 and 400 guilders were paid in 1984. In 1984, the municipality offered the squatters in the Groote Keyser on the Keizersgracht apartments in the Entrepotdok and the squatters refused, since they considered it too far from the city center at that time. After completing this huge social housing project in a prime location in the city, the warehouses on the former GEB site between the Entrepotdoksluis and the Geschutswerf road to the southeast have been converted into apartments for sale in the private sector. The 'Kalenderpanden' (calendar buildings) were named after the months of the year and were squatted in the late 1990s. The municipality refused to negotiate a solution and evicted the buildings in late 2000. The squatters resisted the eviction with burning barricades, having looted two nearby construction sites. Fifteen police officers were injured and eighteen people were arrested. At a farewell party the night before, the writer Geert Mak had lamented that Amsterdam was becoming a place for only yuppies and the elderly. The buildings had become a symbolic point of struggle over the future of Amsterdam. The architectural firm Claus and Kaan created 42 homes here in the 12 buildings. An apartment cost more than ‚Ç¨ 800,000 in 2007. Since 2001, the Aquartis apartment building has been designed by Liesbeth van der Pol on the site of the former power station on the east side of the Entrepot dock. A piece of retaining wall from the original coal storage became part of the new building here.

It is the designation for two separate sections of the old U.S. Route 45 Alternate (US 45 Alt.) that the state continues to maintain. The Crawford section, designated in 2007, runs south to north from US 45 Alt. back to US 45 Alt. in Lowndes County. The other section's southern terminus is at US 45 Alt. south of Okolona in Chickasaw County and the northern terminus is at MS 145 in Shannon in Lee County. Along the way this section intersects MS 41 and the eastern terminus of MS 32 in Okolona. The section from Chickasaw County to Lee County was designated in 1998, after the completion of a four- lane bypass for US 45 Alt.. ==Route description== MS 245 is located in Lowndes, Chickasaw, and Lee counties. The route is legally defined in Mississippi Code ¬ß 65-3-3, and it is maintained by Mississippi Department of Transportation (MDOT) as part of the Mississippi State Highway System. In Lowndes County, MS 245 starts at its intersection with US 45 Alt., and it begins traveling northwestwards. After passing through a small area of trees, the road intersects Main Street and Tarlton Road, entering the city limits of the town. It then passes under a railroad and enters the outskirts of Crawford. MS 245 intersects multiple streets as it turns north towards US 45 Alt.. North of Long Street, the road begins to bend northeastwards, and it soon ends at US 45 Alt.. In Chickasaw County, MS 245 starts at US 45 Alt. south of Egypt. The road begins traveling northwestwards through farmland, intersecting County Roads 410 and 155 (CRD 410 and CRD 155, respectively). North of CRD 252, the route crosses Jolly Creek. MS 245 turns north at CRD 149 and enters Okolona at Filgo Road. Inside the city, the road is known as Church Street, and it enters travels through the residential areas around it. MS 245 meets MS 41 and the western terminus of MS 32 at Monroe Avenue. North of Okolona Elementary School, the road intersects Main Street, which leads to downtown Okolona. On the northern side of the city, MS 245 intersects the entrance to Okolona High School, and it leaves the city limits north of Rasberry Drive. The road turns northeastwards at that point, and it begins traveling through farmland. South of CRD 136, the route crosses over Tallabinnela Creek, and it enters Lee County at CRD 139. The road crosses the Tubbalubba Creek north of the intersection, and Chiwapa Creek north of CRD 506. Past Chiwapa Creek, MS 245 enters Shannon, and it is known as Romie Hill Avenue. The road intersects the entrance of Shannon Elementary School at Mobley Street. The route ends at MS 145 (Noah Curtis Street), and the road continues as MS 145. ==History== The sections that became part of MS 245 were previous part of several older designations. The first two designations, MS 23 and MS 25, were given by 1932, for a gravel road from Starkville to Shannon, and a gravel road from Macon to Tennessee‚ÄìMississippi state line, respectively. The section of MS 23 from Okolona to Shannon was paved by 1937. By 1939, the section of MS 25 from Brooksville to Mayhew was paved. Both designations were replaced by MS 45W around 1940. MS 45W was renumbered to US 45 Alt. by 1968. In 1998, a bypass around Okolona was opened, and US 45 Alt. was rerouted onto the newly constructed divided highway. This was planned as part of the 1987 Four-Lane Highway Program, and the section cost $18.7 million. MS 245 was the designation for US 45 Alt.'s old alignment, from Okolona to Shannon. In 2007, more parts of US 45 Alt. were upgraded to a four- lane highway, and Crawford was bypassed as a result. ==Major intersectionsSee also== * * ==References== 245 Category:Transportation in Lee County, Mississippi Category:Transportation in Chickasaw County, Mississippi Category:U.S. Route 45 Category:Transportation in Lowndes County, Mississippi ","title":"Mississippi Highway 245"},{"id":"61337385","text":"Robert Michael Kitchin\\"The Programmable City\\", CORDIS: European Research.

One year later to the day, it was also the first to die live in the history of French television, on Saturday, February 28, 1987 at midnight, five years before La Cinq (a clear stop for political reasons following the parliamentary elections in the spring of 1986, which were lost by the majority and won by the opposition represented by Jacques Chirac). The new government (the first cohabiting government) had decided to undo the audiovisual achievements and projects of its predecessors (and political opponents) and in particular to reallocate the owner of the sixth channel to M√©tropole T√©l√©vision, thus leaving TV6 very little time to build its programs and demonstrate its audience progress. A few hours after TV6's definitive disappearance, on Sunday, March 1, 1987, M6 broadcast its first live broadcasts. Despite a short broadcast period, TV6 has left its mark on the television genre with personalities such as Jean-Luc Delarue, Child√©ric Muller and Alain Maneval and a new tone, inventing the \\"free antenna\\" and music TV. TV6 has left a strong imprint on a whole generation. == History of the channel == In November 1984, L√©o Scheer, who designed and developed Canal+, left Havas and Andr√© Rousselet to join Publicis and Maurice Levy to implement a new commercial television project in partnership with Europe 1 Communications. In 1985, a little over a year before the parliamentary elections in France, the ruling left feared failure and wanted to create a new space, outside the institutional domain of public television, that would reach a large audience (unlike Canal+ encrypted) and provide an opinion relay for its ideas if it were to return to the opposition. The President of the Republic, Fran√ßois Mitterrand, then launched the idea of \\"an additional space of freedom\\" in a television interview on 16 January and asked Laurent Fabius' government to study the project. Lawyer Jean-Denis Bredin, commissioned by the Prime Minister to write a report on the opening of the \\"television space to private television\\", presented it to him on May 20. It recommended the creation of two national private free-to-air television channels financed by advertising and whose frequencies would be granted by the State in accordance with Article 79 of the Law of 29 July 1982 on audiovisual communication. On 31 July, Georges Fillioud, French Minister of State for Communication Techniques, presented a communication on the development of the audiovisual sector to the Council of Ministers. He announced a bill defining the creation by the spring of 1986 of two new private television channels with national broadcasting, one generalist, the other with a musical vocation, as well as local television channels, in the capital of which would be press groups, production, and advertising companies. Under the guise of an open audiovisual landscape, the choice of formats betrayed the political ulterior motives of the government project, with the generalist channel being able to become an excellent opinion relay for the entire population in the event of electoral defeat, and the music channel a relay more specifically geared towards young people, an important source of voice for the Socialist Party. Following the government's decision to create two new private national television channels and no longer just one, L√©o Scheer and the producer of Les Enfants du Rock, Jean-Martial Lefranc, were developing, under the direction of Maurice L√©vy, the project for a television channel adapted to a new wireless network, targeted at young people. Publicis, the largest advertising agency in Europe, then changed partners for its commercial television project and joined forces with the leaders in communication and the music industry such as NRJ, Gaumont, the Gilbert Gross communication agency and the three music publishing majors, Polygram, Sony and Virgin. This group, which in its form met the conditions laid down by the government's draft law, submitted its application for a public service concession contract to the High Authority for Audiovisual Communication. The project was simply called TV6, after almost being called TNT, Turbo 6, V 6, MV 6, Super 6 or NRJ 6. Three projects were competing for the award of the sixth network concession: CLT, the unsuccessful candidate for the fifth channel, which was still seeking to establish RTL Television in France, the Publicis/Gaumont/NRJ/Gilbert Gross consortium, and the Hit FM/RSCG consortium led by the incumbent's favourite advertiser, Jacques S√©gu√©la. On 28 January 1986, the government chose TV6, a company led by Publicis, to create the first French television channel devoted to youth and music. The 18-year public service concession contract between the State and TV6 was signed on the same day and the decree approving the contract and the specifications of the sixth channel was published on 21 February. The channel was required to devote at least 50% of its broadcasting time to music and, contrary to the specifications of La Cinq, was subject to the same obligations as public channels for the time between theatrical release and film screening and the quotas for broadcasting French films. It was also required to broadcast 350 hours of its own productions in the first year and produce 100 video clips. After the looping of a trailer on 22 February 1986 on TDF's new sixth terrestrial network, TV6, France's leading music television channel, began broadcasting on Saturday 1 March 1986 at 14:00. Faithful to its target audience, it called itself the youngest TV channel and devoted itself entirely to contemporary music. Each of the project's partners contributed to the project: Gaumont brought its catalog of films and television series, NRJ its animators and musical know-how and Publicis taking charge of the channel's management and advertising management. As a private commercial channel, TV6 would broadcast two minutes of advertising every twenty minutes. Following the parliamentary elections of March 1986, the right returned to power. Jacques Chirac was Prime Minister and asked his new Minister of Communication, Fran√ßois L√©otard, to implement the government's audiovisual policy: privatisation of TF1 and cancellation of the concessions of the two new private channels, La Cinq and TV6, which were too quickly awarded on pressure from the √âlys√©e without a real call for tenders. By Decree No. 86-901 of 30 July 1986, Jacques Chirac's government decided to reallocate this channel before the end of its concession. Following an appeal by TV6, this decree was annulled by the decision of the Conseil d'√âtat on 2 February 1987, because the Minister had not respected the legal deadline of the one-year concession. However, on 15 January 1987, the Commission nationale de la communication et des libert√©s (CNCL), which succeeded the Haute Autorit√© de la communication audiovisuelle on 30 September 1986, set out the general and specific obligations of \\"private national free-to-air terrestrial television\\" in Decisions No. 87-1 and 87-2. On 2 February 1987, Decree No. 87-51 terminated the concession contract for the sixth channel, which ended at midnight on 28 February 1987 and at the same time opened the call for applications for the reallocation of the network. The CNCL was hearing the M√©tropole T√©l√©vision project presented by Lyonnaise des Eaux in partnership with CLT, the producer Marin Karmitz (MK2) and the press group Amaury, the T√©l√© Fiction Musique group, as well as TV6, candidate for its own succession. To thwart the project M√©tropole T√©l√©vision de la Lyonnaise des Eaux and CLT, which was favored by the government (Jacques Chirac having already promised the sixth channel to his friend J√©r√¥me Monod, CEO of Lyonnaise des Eaux, as well as to CLT against an agreement on the Luxembourg vote on the common agricultural policy), Publicis then negotiated with Lyonnaise des Eaux to make a new round table involving both new and old operators, as Silvio Berlusconi had done a few days earlier with Robert Hersant for La Cinq. However, the negotiations did not succeed and on February 25 and 26, 1987, the CNCL allocated the sixth network to M√©tropole T√©l√©vision. Serge Gainsbourg, Johnny Hallyday, Eddy Mitchell and other personalities, called on the government in vain to try to save TV6. On February 28, 1987, TV6's headquarters, whose one-year concession had not been renewed, was stormed by young television viewers who invaded the Champs- √âlys√©es and improvised a demonstration with the artists (Francis Lalanne, Marc Lavoine, Myl√®ne Farmer, Patrick Bruel, etc.). Fifteen thousand over-excited teenagers went up the avenue to the Star. Child√©ric Muller, the star of the chain, had to climb a tree with a megaphone to disperse the crowd at the end of the demonstration. In the evening, TV6 broadcast its latest show from the set of the Tam-Tam show installed at VCF in Saint-Cloud in the presence of many artists and all the channel's hosts (Smicky, Jean-Luc Delarue, Isabelle Duhamel, Fr√©d√©ric Smektala, Fr√©d√©ric de Rieux, Childeric Muller and Alain Maneval who carried a sign with the words \\"y'en a qu'une, c'est la 6\\" (a reference to TF1's slogan at that time). The programme ended with a Star Wars parody clip in which Darth Vader (symbolizing the new right-wing government Chirac/Balladur) congratulates himself on the victory of the Empire (the Lyonnaise des Eaux/CLT group) over the rebellion (TV6 owned by Publicis/NRJ) and explodes the TV6 planet. The next day, March 1, 1987, M6 took over at 11:15 a.m. in the morning, on the same frequencies where its late competitor had turned off its transmitters at midnight. Benefiting from a network of transmitters mainly located in the major urban basins of France, M6 would nevertheless have to retain in its programming a certain musical dominance, inherited from TV6. == Organization  Executives === ;President *Maurice L√©vy ;General director *L√©o Scheer (Designer and operational manager of TV6) ;Deputy general director *Jean-Martial Lefranc ;Director of programming *Patrice Blanc-Francard === Capital === TV6's share capital was FRF 10,000,000,000, 25% held by Publicis, 25% by Gaumont, 18% by NRJ, 12% by Gilbert Gross, and the remaining 20% being divided between management, private individuals and the 'three majors' of music publishing: Polygram, Sony and Virgin. === Headquarters === TV6's registered office was located at 133 avenue des Champs-Elys√©es in the 8th arrondissement of Paris, the headquarters of its main shareholder Publicis. == Programming == From March to September 1986, TV6 opened its antenna every day at 2 p.m. and broadcast until midnight a schedule containing only music programs. From October 25, 1986, TV6 began broadcasting television series and a soap opera, as well as films, mainly from the Gaumont catalog and selected by G√©rard Jourd'hui. TV6 tried to differentiate itself from its competitors by the editorial choice made for films and series that could not be seen elsewhere. Dominique Duforest was in charge of selecting the video clips and their programming and on-air packaging. The musical jingles were made by producer-arranger Jean-Pierre Castelain. === Program grids === TV series are marked in green; TV movies in pink; shows in golden brown and movies in brown.

As broadcasts were retransmitted in SECAM with \\"line identification\\" to facilitate the transmission of new TV services of the time (Teletext, VPS, etc.), several households had to change antennas (Broadband) or TV receivers as a result of incompatibilities with the historical SECAM \\"frame identification\\" format (SECAM bottles (archive)) resulting in a black and white image on the stations concerned. These technical developments were to some extent an obstacle to the deployment of the sixth channel network in the country. As a private channel, TV6 had to finance the new transmitters installed by TDF, with the help of some local authorities wishing to meet the expectations of their citizens. TV6 was also relayed throughout France via the Telecom 1B satellite, which, thanks to La Cinq, would promote the deployment of parabolic equipment in France. == Audience == In 1987, TV6 reached more than ten million households (covering the √éle-de-France, Lyon and Marseille regions). However, its launch was compromised due to technical difficulties in receiving it (TV channels less powerful than those of TF1, Antenne 2, FR3, Canal+, and La Cinq). Due to the absence of a reliable audience measurement concerning it at the time (the audience rating did not concern La Cinq or TV6), the press and the media had treated it as marginal. Finally, the powerful cable television lobby (Lyonnaise des Eaux, Compagnie g√©n√©rale des eaux, France T√©l√©com), seeing in it a national thematic channel likely to hinder its development, did everything to minimize its success. From the beginning, the channel had a daily audience of 500,000 viewers, representing 0.3% of the audience, mainly teenagers. After a year of broadcasts, more than 14 million French people knew TV6. ==See also== * Publicis * Gaumont * NRJ Group * Virgin * NRJ 12 * M6 == References == Category:Companies disestablished in 1987 Category:Television channels and stations disestablished in 1987 Category:Defunct French television channels Category:Publicis Groupe Category:Defunct companies of France Category:Television channels and stations established in 1986 Category:1986 establishments in France Category:1987 disestablishments in France ","title":"TV6 (French TV channel)"},{"id":"61337400","text":"Christopher Eric Edward Higham (born 1930), is a male former athlete who competed for England. ==Athletics career== He represented England and won a silver medal in the 120 yards hurdles at the 1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Vancouver, Canada. ==References== Category:1930 births Category:English male hurdlers Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Games Category:Commonwealth Games medallists in athletics Category:Commonwealth Games silver medallists for England Category:Living people ","title":"Chris Higham"},{"id":"61337405","text":"Calliostoma bullatum is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Calliostomatidae. == Distribution == Fossil evidence indicates that this species formerly lived as far north as what is now the Mediterranean Sea, but presently it is only known from abyssal habitats off the coast of West Africa, where it largely lives among deep-water coral reefs. == Description and rediscovery == This species is notable for being described as a fossil well before live individuals were found.

With Theresa Wallach, she crossed the Sahara by 600cc Panther motorcycle, sidecar and trailer from London to Cape Town in 1934-5, making the return journey on her own in 1935-6. ==Early life== Florence Margaret Charlotte Blenkiron was born in Harmby, Yorkshire to John Blenkiron and Mary (n√©e Ainsley Atkinson). She had one older brother, John William Amiby Blenkiron (b.1900). Her father was grocer's assistant in 1901 census but by 1911 the family were living in Ellerton Abbey, Marrick, in the North Riding of Yorkshire, where the extended Blenkiron family had lived for generations. In 1911 her father was listed as living on private means. == Early working life == Blenkiron became Secretary to Robert Hadfield, owner of Hadfield's Steel Foundry in Sheffield, one of the largest foundries in the world. == Motorcycle racing == Blenkiron rode her first motorcycle at the age of sixteen. She joined in the first Ladies Race at Brooklands race course in 1928 which had been organised by Lady Malcolm Campbell. Her next race at Brooklands was on 30 September 1933 which is when it is thought she first met Teresa Wallach. On 18 October 1933, Blenkiron won her first race, the Three-lap All-Comer's Handicap, becoming the first woman to win a race open to both men and women. Blenkiron and Wallach joined various motorcycle groups and competed in competitions to improve their skills. They shared a house in south London and Wallach took to calling Florence \\"Blenk\\". On 14 April 1934, Blenkiron became the first woman to break the 100-mile per hour barrier on a motorcycle, riding a 500cc Grindlay-Peerless bike. She reached the speed of 102.06 mph and was awarded the British Motor Cycle Racing Club's Gold Star Award. Only two other women have ever received this award, Beatrice Shilling in August 1934 and Theresa Wallach in 1939. Blenkiron was interested in visiting family friends in Cape Town and after a joking conversation about getting there by motorcycle, the two women started to plan a trip in earnest. The planning took over a year, and sponsorship was hard to come by at first, until Phelon and Moore Ltd. became interested in the project, offering them a choice of model from their catalogue. They chose a 600cc Panther, registration number YG 7474. Other sponsors then emerged, including the provision of the trailer and sidecar by Watsonian, and Blenkiron proceeded to stress test the equipment at various events in 1934. == Journey to Cape Town - The Rugged Road == On 11 December 1934, Florence Blenkiron and Theresa Wallach set out from Crown House, Aldwych in London to Cape Town, South Africa, on their 600cc single- cylinder Panther motorcycle named \\"Venture\\" with sidecar and trailer, seen off by a crowd which included Lady Astor, the first woman MP, and the High Commissioner of what was then South Rhodesia. The event was widely reported in the press, as was their progress on the journey. In June 1935 the Woman Engineer Journal reported \\"Miss Wallach and Miss Blenkiron are now heading for Nairobi on their motorcycle combination; some of their more unpleasant adventures have included four nights in a tropical jungle without food or shelter, and capture by Tourags in the desert\\". The route they had planned took them through Folkestone, Boulogne, Paris, Marseilles, Algiers to Ghardaia, In Salah to Tamanrassat then via In Guezzam to Agadez. Leaving there on 4 March 1935, then travelled through to Katsina by 11 March then to Kano, and to Fort Archambault by 19 April. From there they travelled to Ekibondo by 30 April, passing Mt Ruwenzori to Kampala, then Nairobi arriving in Arusha by 5 June. They travelled past Mt Kilimanjaro, reaching Iringo by 11 June, then via Victoria Falls, through Bulawayo reaching Beitbridge by 11 July. They finally arrived in Cape Town on 29 July 1935, having recorded snippets of their journey on film and still photographs. == Return journey to London == Although the original plan has been for both women to ride the return journey Theresa Wallach left Cape Town for London by ship. Blenkiron left Cape Town alone on the \\"Venture II\\" motorcycle and sidecar on 18 September 1935. She is thought to have travelled through Salisbury, Nairobi, Faradje, Niangara, Bula, Fardje, Marouna and having to abandon travelling by motorcycle and tow it behind a bus from Kano as the local authorities were unwilling for her to travel alone due to the cost of a potential rescue mission. She reached Algiers by 10 February 1936 and completed the journey back to London by April 1936 where she arrived to meet the High Commissioned for (what was then) South Rhodesia at Rhodesia House and present him with a letter from the Prime Minister of South Africa. == After the journey == In an interview on her return, Blenkiron said she was planning to write a book about the experiences, but this never materialised. She published \\"Exclusive Graphic Story\\" in the Newcastle Sunday Sun on 3 May 1936, illustrated with some photographs of the journey. She was elected as an Associate Member of the Women's Engineering Society in 1938 in recognition of the journey to Cape Town and back, along with her considerable experience of the administrative side of steel production whilst working for the foundry firm Hadfields Ltd. In 1937 Blenkiron began to advertise her services as a chauffeur and tour guide. She placed an advert in The Woman Engineer journal for \\"Valet Motoring Go wherever you will, not where you must Private Tours at home and abroad arranged exclusively to please you and your friends Miss Florence Blenkiron experienced courier, with own 18 h.p. 7-seater de luxe saloon, will drive, conduct and attend to your personal requirements en route. Specialist in African Travel. Also hour, day or period hire, and sightseeing drives. Terms by arrangement 174, Holland Park Avenue, London W.11 Tel: Park 7330\\". In 1938 Blenkiron's chauffeuring business took her to Melbourne, Australia on board the SS Orcades as a chauffeuse and companion, touring the country. == World War Two == In December 1939, The Woman Engineer reported that Blenkiron \\"came back post haste from Australia when war was declared. She hopes to be allowed to do her \\"bit\\" without further delay\\" and by autumn 1940 it was able to share that \\"Miss Florence Blenkiron A.T.S. ... is to sail shortly for Kenya with the Mechanised Transport Corps.\\". Blenkiron wrote to the Women's Engineering Society from Pretoria in the summer of 1941 that \\"we are housed in most comfortable huts in the military quarters and have helped the transport workers generally, driving cars, six wheeled lorries etc ‚Ä¶ it is awfully difficult to know just how much one may say in a letter so I think perhaps I should wait until I can relate my experiences at the end of the war\\" and that she had just received marching orders to go North. == Marriage in India == In 1945 Blenkiron moved to Calcutta (Kolcata) in India to join the staff of the YMCA War Services Club, where she took charge of transport. She met Kenneth Malcolm Kingaby there whilst he was a serving army officer. In November 1945 she resigned her commission and they married in January 1946, moving to Bombay (Mumbai) where Florence took over running the YMCA War Services Club. Florence returned to Britain for a month arriving at Tilbury on 3 November 1947 on the ship Strathmore and leaving Liverpool for Bombay on the Empress of India on December 1947. Once the club closed and Kenneth was demobbed from the army, he worked for an American pharmaceutical and Florence project managed the restoration of a factory for his company, before they returned to Britain in 1955. They took up farming but Kenneth's health meant they had to give this up in 1959, and he became a farm accountant. == Death and Commemoration == Florence Kingaby died on 4 Mar 1991 in Thornhaugh, Peterborough. In 2018, a collection of previously unknown 66 Ilford Special Lantern Plate glass slides (8.3cn x 8.3 cm) in a Union Jack patterned box, showing the 'Venture' Panther motorcycle and sidecar, and scenes and countryside along the route of Florence and Theresa's journey from London to Cape Town were auction by Tooveys Auction House in West Sussex. They made ¬£1300. == References  Further reading == * Category:1904 births Category:1991 deaths Category:English motorcycle racers Category:YMCA leaders Category:Women's Engineering Society Category:Women engineers Category:People from Yorkshire Category:People from North Yorkshire Category:British motorcycle racers Category:Women motorcyclists Category:Members of the Women's Engineering Society ","title":"Florence Blenkiron"},{"id":"61337542","text":"View of the cemetery in 2013 Bad Ischl Friedhof is the town cemetery of Bad Ischl in Austria.

Based in Ravenscourt Park, West London, its part-time soldiers saw service at Gallipoli, in Palestine, and on the Western Front during World War I. After the war the battalion was amalgamated into a unit of the new Royal Corps of Signals. ==Origin== When the former Volunteer Force was subsumed into the new Territorial Force (TF) under the Haldane Reforms in 1908,Beckett, pp. 247‚Äì53.Dunlop, Chapter 14.Spiers, Chapter 10. the 2nd (South) Middlesex Volunteer Rifle Corps and the 4th Middlesex Volunteer Rifle Corps (The Kensington Rifles) were reorganised to form the 13th (Kensington) Battalion in the new London Regiment. This amalgamation, with its loss of traditions of their old unit, was not popular with the 2nd (South) Middlesex, and about 300 officers and men left to form the nucleus of the 10th Battalion, Duke of Cambridge's Own (Middlesex Regiment). This was considered a new unit, and was not allowed to retain the battle honour that detachments of the 2nd (South) Middlesex had won for service in the Second Boer War.Bailey & Hollier, p. 7.Westlake, Rifle Volunteers, p. 164. However, the 2nd Middlesex's Honorary Colonel, Lord Wolverton, and Regular Army adjutant, Captain J.F.C. Fuller, continued in their positions with the 10th Middlesex and helped to set up the new unit. (Fuller later became a noted military writer and theoretician, and claimed that his post with the 10th Middlesex inspired him to study soldiering seriously.)Beckett, p. 202.Fuller, pp. 10-21. The new battalion established its headquarters (HQ) with C‚ÄìH Companies at Stamford Brook Lodge, Ravenscourt Park; A Company was based at St John's College, Battersea, and B Company at St Mark's College, Chelsea, in King's Road. The St Pauls School Cadet Corps transferred its affiliation from the 2nd (South) Middlesex to the new unit.Monthly Army List, various dates.Lineage of London units at Stepping Forward.Drill Hall Register at Stepping Forward. Together with the 7th, 8th and 9th Bns, the 10th Battalion formed the Middlesex Brigade of the TF's Home Counties Division.Becke, Pt 2a, pp. 49‚Äì54.Middlesex Rgt at Long, Long Trail.44th (HC) Division at Long, Long Trail. ==World War IMobilisation=== When mobilisation orders arrived on 4 August 1914 about half of 10th Battalion were with the Home Counties Division at its annual training, marching from Aldershot to Salisbury Plain. The Middlesex Brigade was at Larkhill, and 10th Battalion had to lay out in the rain outside Amesbury Station before it could entrain at 05.30 on 5 August. It then returned to Ravenscourt Park and together with the men who could not attend camp it mobilised under Lieutenant-Colonel C.R. Johnson, TD, who had been its Commanding Officer (CO) since 27 July 1912. The battalion moved to its war station at Sheerness the same day, leaving an officer to enlist the 300 or so men required to bring the battalion up to its war establishment. This was quickly accomplished from the floods of volunteers coming forwards.Wyrall, Vol I, pp. 2, 67‚Äì9. On 10 August units of the Territorial Force were invited to volunteer for Overseas Service, and on 31 August, the formation of a reserve or 2nd Line unit was authorised for each 1st Line unit where 60 per cent or more of the men had volunteered. The titles of these 2nd Line units would be the same as the original, but distinguished by a '2/' prefix. The Home Service-only and under-age men, together with the recruits who were coming forward, remained at the depot to form the 2/10th Bn, which came into existence on 12 September under the command of Lt-Col Johnson and was almost at full strength by the end of October. Subsequently, 3/10th and 4/10th Battalions were formed.Becke, Pt 2b, p. 6.Wyrall, Vol I, pp. 69‚Äì72.Wyrall, Vol I, pp. 183‚Äì4. ===1/10th Battalion=== Two 1st Line TF battalions of the Middlesex Regiment left in early September 1914 to relieve Regular battalions in the Gibraltar garrison, then in October the rest of the Home Counties Division was ordered to India to relieve Regular troops there. The 1/10th Middlesex embarked at Southampton on 29 October in the transport Royal George, and disembarked at Bombay on 2 December. On arrival, the Home Counties Division was split up and the battalions were distributed to stations all over India. By May 1915, the 1/10th Bn was at Fort William (Calcutta), with 'hill parties' (convalescents and leave men) at Darjeeling. For the next four years the 1/10th Bn acted as a peacetime garrison, while suffering a steady drain of its best men to officer training and other duties. For example, on 5 November 1917 the battalion supplied a draft of 100 men to the 1/9th Middlesex to bring that battalion up to full strength to take part in the Mesopotamian campaign.Wyrall, Vol II, pp. 331‚Äì2, 335, 341. ===2/10th Battalion=== The 2/10th Battalion joined the 2nd Middlesex Brigade, which was close to full strength by 22 October 1914, and the 2nd Home Counties Division began to form in the Windsor area soon afterwards. Training was hampered by lack of modern arms and equipment ‚Äì only a few old .256-in Japanese Ariska rifles were available for the infantry. However, in this half-trained and -equipped state, the 2/10th Middlesex was sent on 24 April 1915to join the Welsh Border Brigade in the Welsh Division, which was preparing to go overseas. The Welsh Border Brigade had sent its 1st Line battalions to reinforce Regular divisions on the Western Front and was being reconstituted at Cambridge with 2nd Line Home Counties battalions; soon afterwards it was renumbered 160th Brigade when the division became the 53rd (Welsh) Division.Becke, Pt 2b, pp. 75‚Äì82.67th (2nd HC) Division at Long, Long Trail.Becke, Pt 2a, pp. 117‚Äì23.53rd (W) Division at Long, Long Trail. In May the division moved to Bedford to continue its training, and on 2 July was reported fit for service in the Mediterranean. The battalion entrained for Devonport Dockyard on 17 July and embarked on HM Transport Huntsgreen (formerly the German Norddeutscher Lloyd shipping line's Derfflinger). It disembarked in Alexandria on 1 August and moved to Port Said.Westlake, Gallipoli, pp. 179‚Äì80. Gallipoli The 53rd (W) Division was destined as reinforcements for the Gallipoli Campaign. After sailing to Lemnos and then Imbros, the battalion landed on C Beach at Suvla Bay at about midnight on 8 August under the command of Lt-Col C.H. Pank. It began beach fatigues under shellfire before moving to the western slopes of Lala Baba at nightfall on 9 August. The landing had been chaotic, but 53rd (W) Division was ordered to attack the W Hills the following day to recover the position. The first phase of the attack, on Scimitar Hill, was to be carried out by 159th (Cheshire) Brigade, after which 158th (North Wales) Bde reinforced by 2/10th Middlesex from 160th Bde would pass through to attack the Anafarta Spur. 2/10th Middlesex set off at dawn across a salt lake to join the firing line at Chocolate Hill, with no cover and under heavy shelling, machine gun and rifle fire, and from Chocolate Hill the firing line was unable to advance to Scimitar Hill. A second attack was ordered for 16.30, but the only troops to advance were two companies of the 2/10th, who went forward about before discovering that they were unsupported and fell back, having lost further casualties.Aspinall-Oglander, pp. 297‚Äì302.North, p. 174.Dudley Ward, pp. 34‚Äì41.Wyrall, Vol I, pp. 185‚Äì9. The companies were gathered during the night and the battalion was moved a few hundred yards to its left, where it dug in until relieved on 13 August. It then returned to the beach and fatigue duties until the end of the month, under continual shellfire during daylight hours.Dudley Ward, p. 41.Wyrall, Vol I, p. 189. From then on the battalion endured spells in the front line alternating with digging positions in the rear. By the end of October it was reduced by battle casualties and sickness to about half of its pre-landing strength. In November the 2/10th Middlesex was reinforced by four officers and 200 men from the 9th Bn Sherwood Foresters in 11th (Northern) Division. The battalion was evacuated to Lemnos aboard the El Kahirah on 13 December. Palestine From Lemnos the 53rd Division was shipped to Alexandria, and began a long period of rest and recuperation guarding the Nile Valley in Egypt. When the Turkish Army attacked the Suez Canal defences in August 1916, leading to the Battle of Romani, only part of 53rd Division was actually engaged, but the 2/10th Middlesex was present and so was later awarded the battle honour for Rumani.MacMunn & Falls, p. 156.Wyrall, Vol I, Ch. XXVI. The British opened the Sinai and Palestine Campaign in March 1917 when the Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF) advanced towards Gaza, with 53rd Division in the Desert Column. The 1st Battle of Gaza began at 03.30 on 26 March, when 160th Brigade started to cross Wadi Ghuzzee. Shortly afterwards, fog began to roll in from the sea, slowing the advance, but the attack began shortly after 11.45. By 13.30 the brigade had captured 'The Labyrinth', a maze of entrenched gardens, but 2/10th Middlesex's further advance was slowed up by four belts of barbed wire and at 15.30 it requested reinforcements and ammunition; two companies of 2/4th Queens (Royal West Surrey Regiment) arrived at 17.00. By 18.30 the whole position had been secured. But events had not gone so well elsewhere, and the brigade's advanced positions were still outflanked. At 19.00 the Middlesex's CO reported that unless reinforced, his position was untenable; nevertheless, he was ordered to consolidate. However 160th Bde was ordered to pull back at midnight, and by 04.30 on 27 March 2/10th Middlesex was back on its starting position behind Wadi Ghuzzee. The battalion's casualties amounted to four officers killed and five wounded, 14 other ranks (ORs) killed, 108 wounded and 22 missing.Bullock, pp. 44‚Äì5.MacMunn & Falls, pp. 279‚Äì315Wyrall, Vol II, pp. 309‚Äì13. A second attempt to take Gaza began on 17 April, and the 53rd Division attacked in the second phase on 19 April. The objective for 160th Brigade was Samson Ridge, and 2/10th Bn set out at 07.15 towards the right hand Redoubt on the ridge. The attack proceeded slowly, held up by machine gun fire, the top eventually being taken at the point of the bayonet. However, the attack elsewhere failed, and the troops dug in at the end of the day. The battalion had lost 2 officers killed and 7 wounded, 35 ORs killed or died of wounds, 6 missing and 132 wounded.Bullock, pp. 46‚Äì7.MacMunn & Falls, pp. 334‚Äì49.Wyrall, Vol II, pp. 313‚Äì5. There followed a pause of several months while the EEF was reorganised. The 2/10th Bn's CO, Lt-Col V.L. Pearson, was promoted to command 160th Bde and was replaced by Major A.P. Hohler. The battalion participated in a number of raids, including the capture of Sugar Loaf Hill on 15 August. It was then withdrawn from the line for intensive training. On 24 October it returned to take up outpost positions before the 3rd Battle of Gaza opened on 31 October. This operation involved other formations outflanking the Gaza‚ÄìBeersheba line, after which 2/10th Bn advanced its outposts on 1 and 2 November. 53rd Division was sent on 3 November to take the heights of Tel el Khuweilfe. 160th Brigade moved up a slight valley on the right, but found the enemy in strength, and holding the water supplies. The attack was renewed unsuccessfully the following day. The division kept up the pressure: on 6 November it fended off attack after attack on its advanced positions, quickly regaining them when pushed off; 2/10th Middlesex was in reserve for this action. Eventually the Turks were forced to evacuate the position after being outflanked elsewhere. 2/10th Battalion moved forwards to occupy the high ground during daylight on 13 and 14 November during the Action of El Mughar, for which it received the battle honour, though not actually engaged.Bullock, pp. 75‚Äì6.Falls, pp. 84‚Äì105, 125.Wyrall, Vol II, pp. 315‚Äì9. By early December the EEF was working round Jerusalem with 53rd (W) Division advancing towards Bethlehem as flank guard. 2/10th Middlesex and 2/4th Queen's were ordered to capture the hills at Beit Jala on 8 December and advanced under shellfire that was so accurate that the Middlesex had to pass one road junction by rushes by small parties. But the two battalions found the objective unoccupied. Jerusalem fell the following day.Falls, p. 251.Wyrall, Vol II, pp. 319‚Äì20. On 21 December, 160th Brigade carried out a minor operation at Ras ez Zamby near Jericho. At 05.00 2/4th Queens captured a Turkish post, and the Turks fell back to 'White Hill'. A company of 2/10th Middlesex, together with one of 2/4th Queen's, then took this position after fierce close fighting with bombs, bayonets, and clubbed rifles.Falls, p. 277.Wyrall, Vol II, pp. 321‚Äì2. On 27 December the Turks made a strong counter-attack towards Jerusalem; although 2/4th Queen's withdrew from White Hill, its machine guns prevented the Turks from holding it in force, and 2/10th Middlesex recaptured Ras ez Zamby. Meanwhile, a detached company of 2/10th Bn successfully held the Monastery at Deir Obeid for 12 hours against a separate Turkish attack, despite two Turkish field guns being brought up to breach the walls. Shortly afterwards the Turkish attackers were dispersed by British artillery, who also silenced another artillery attack the following day.Falls, pp. 281‚Äì2.Wyrall, Vol II, pp. 322‚Äì3. 160th Brigade was rested for the first 10 days of January 1918, but after returning to the front east of Jerusalem it carried out a small operation to advance the line on 18 January, with two platoons of D Company, 2/10th Middlesex, assisting 2/4th Bn Royal West Kent Regiment. The EEF began a new operation on 19 February with Jericho as its objective. 2/10th Middlesex moved out at 22.00 the previous night to secure a crossing over the Wadi Asa. When the attack began at 05.30 on 19 February, C Company launched the battalion's attack towards the village of Rammun, but was held up by a group of Turks with a machine gun. Two platoons of D Company were sent up as reinforcements, and the village and high ground as taken by 08.45. The battalion then held it during the day under heavy shellfire. The following night was quiet: patrols found no sign of the enemy, and on 21February Jericho was occupied by the EEF. The 2/10th Bn then advanced its positions under cover of bad weather. It then spent the first part of March roadmaking while the EEF advanced methodically towards the River Jordan.Falls, p. 307.Wyrall, Vol II, pp. 324‚Äì6. During the subsequent operations in the Judaean Hills, 53rd Division was ordered to capture Tell 'Asur. This led to further heavy fighting, with half of 2/10th Bn marching by night to drive off a Turkish counter-attack at 04.55 on 10 March. 160th Brigade forced its way steadily forward over broken ground on 11 March to reach the hills beyond. On 12 March C Company assisted 2/4th West Kents in an unsuccessful attempt to take an unreconnoitred position.Falls, pp. 314‚Äì321.Wyrall, Vol II, pp. 326‚Äì7. The EEF then prepared to cross the Jordan on 21 March. A platoon of 2/10th Middlesex with two machine guns was ordered to make a feint crossing at the Auja ford while 'Shea's Group' threw troops across at other points. While Shea's Group carried out its trans-Jordan raid, 2/10th Middlesex remained west of the river skirmishing against the Turkish cavalry screen on 29 and 30 March. Otherwise the battalion was engaged mainly in roadmaking. Further skirmishing occurred on 22 April, when the battalion pushed an outpost forwards to 'Round Hill', which overlooked the Jordan, on 2 May when C Company drive off an attack on 'Ide Hill', and on 22/23 May when A and B Companies carried out a night raid on 'Fife Knoll'.Wyrall, Vol II, pp. 327‚Äì9. The summer saw the battalion alternating between holding the line and being in reserve. Lieutenant-Col Hohler left to command 160th Bde and Maj C. Jarrett assumed command. By now the EEF was suffering a manpower shortage, and on 19 August 1918 the 2/10 Bn left 160th Bde and moved back to El Qantara, Egypt, where it was broken up to provide drafts for other units.Wyrall, Vol II, p. 329. ===3/10th Battalion=== The 3/10th Battalion was formed in May 1915 from details and surplus men from the 2/10th when that battalion was warned for overseas service. It was stationed at Ashford, then at Staines and Reigate, but real training began at Bulmer Camp, Brighton. By November 1915 it had joined 2nd Middlesex Bde (now numbered 201st (2/1st Middlesex) Brigade at Tonbridge. The 2nd Home Counties Division (now 67th (2nd Home Counties) Division) formed part of Second Army in Central Force. 67th (2nd HC) Division had the dual role of home defence and supplying drafts to units serving overseas. It was twice warned for service in Ireland and in April 1917 for service with the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) on the Western Front, but these deployments never materialised and the division spent the whole war in England. By September 1916 it was stationed with 201st Bde round Bourne Park and Barham in Kent.Wyrall, Vol I, p. 71. Few 3rd Line TF battalions saw service overseas, but in May 1917 the 3/10th Middlesex left 67th (HC) Division and embarked at Southampton for France. Landing at Le Havre on 1 June it moved to Hesdin where it joined 1st South African Brigade in 9th (Scottish) Division on 6 June. At first it was employed in the old German front line providing digging and wiring parties for the Royal Engineers (RE) constructing new defences. The companies then took turns in the front line for instruction in trench warfare, suffering a few casualties. On 23 July the battalion was attached to 4th Division in the Arras sector, and formally transferred to its 10th Bde on 2 August. The battalion carried out a few fighting patrols during the summer monthsBecke Pt 3a, p. 5.Becke, Pt 1, pp. 57‚Äì63.Wyrall, Vol II, pp 132‚Äì3. Ypres 4th Division now entered the Third Ypres Offensive. After 10 days' training, the battalion moved into camp at Elverdinghe in the Ypres Salient on 29 September. That night the camp was bombed, 7 ORs being killed and 42 wounded. On 3/4 October it moved up to the front line near Langemarcke, from which it was the division was to launch its attack (part of the Battle of Broodseinde) on 4 October. 10th Brigade attacked at 06.00 from Eagle Trench, with 3/10th Middlesex supporting 2nd Bn Seaforth Highlanders. The Seaforths attacked over difficult, heavily shelled ground, behind a 'very ragged' barrage, crossed 19 Metre Hill and got about 80 yards down its forward slope. 3/10th Middlesex was about 150 yards behind, and dealt with a concrete pillbox on the left flank. By 09.30 the advance had stalled. Lying out on the open forward slope, the Seaforths and Middlesex were raked by machine gun fire. Unable to advance, the advanced companies had to withdraw in the face of German counter-attacks at 15.00. 3/10th Middlesex held its line of shell- holes, but despite holding the enemy was unable to obtain any support or ammunition. Finally at 03.15 on 5 October some ammunition arrived, enabling the remnants of the two battalions to maintain their position through the day and following night. At 00.15 on 6 October the battalion was relieved, and the survivors carried their wounded out of action. The battalion had suffered casualties of 12 officers and 365 ORs out of 30 officers and 492 ORs who had gone into action. 10th Brigade was not engaged in the subsequent attacks made by 4th Division, though 3/10th Middlesex provided some carrying parties for the RE and Machine Gun Corps during the Battle of Broodseinde and suffering further casualties.Edmonds, 1917, Vol II, pp. 311, 336, 344.Wyrall, Vol II, pp. 133‚Äì42. After the terrible casualties of 1917, the BEF was forced to reduce the establishment of an infantry brigade from four to three battalions. On 20 February 1918 the bulk of 3/10th Bn was drafted to reinforce other battalions. The residue combined with those of the Household Battalion to form the 11th Entrenching Bn, which carried out labour duties until the men were required as reinforcement drafts.Wyrall, Vol II, pp. 182‚Äì3.Household Bn at Long, Long Trail.Entrenching Battalions, The National Archives, Kew, file WO 95/5494. ===4/10th Battalion=== Like the 3/10th Bn, the 4/10 Middlesex was formed in May 1915 with the role of training drafts for the battalions serving overseas. It moved to Cambridge, and was later stationed at Purfleet in Essex. On 8 April 1916 it was redesignated 10th Reserve Bn, Middlesex Regiment, and in September was absorbed into the 7th Reserve Bn. ==Disbandment== When the TF was reformed as the Territorial Army in 1920‚Äì21, 10th Bn Middlesex Regiment was merged with the Brighton-based former Home Counties Divisional Signal Company of the Royal Engineers to form 44th (Home Counties) Divisional Signals in the new Royal Corps of Signals. The new unit was based at the 10th Middlesex's drill hall at Stamford Brook Lodge, (though the original drill hall building may have been demolished in 1921) with a company at Brighton.Lord & Watson, pp. 152‚Äì3.Nalder, p. 598. ==Honorary Colonel== Frederick, 4th Lord Wolverton, who had been Honorary Colonel of the 2nd (South Middlesex) VRC since 29 August 1903, continued in that role with the 10th Bn Middlesex Regiment. ==Battle Honours== The 10th Battalion contributed the following Battle honours to the Middlesex Regiment: * 2/10th Battalion: Suvla, Landing at Suvla, Scimitar Hill, Gallipoli 1915, Rumani, Egypt 1917, Gaza, El Mughar, Jerusalem, Jericho, Jordan, Tell‚Äô Asur, Palestine 1917-1918 * 3/10th Battalion: Ypres 1917, Polygon Wood, France and Flanders 1917-1918 ==Memorials== There are World War I memorial plaques to the 1/10th, 2/10th and 3/10th Battalions inside St Nicholas Church, Chiswick, where the Regimental Colours of the 10th Bn (1910‚Äì21)Middlesex colours at Stepping Forward. and the King's colours presented to 2/10th and 3/10th Bns after World War I are displayed. The metal plaque to the 1/10th Bn (North Wall) lists 58 members of the battalion who died on service (though it is not clear how many of these were seconded to other units).IWM War Memorial Register, Ref 47683.Middlesex memorials at Stepping Forward. There are two plaques to the 2/10th Bn (South Wall): one is of stone, the other accompanying the battalion roll of honour is of wood and incorporates a small cross carved in 1917 by the soldiers from wood found on the Mount of Olives; this cross was used by their Chaplain for the rest of the war. The plaque to the 3/10th Bn (South Wall) is made of brass.

She studied psychology at the Universit√© de Montr√©al, earning a bachelor's degree in 1945 and a master's degree in 1947. She pursued clinical training at the Centre d'orientation in Montreal (1948), at the Children's Center in Boston (1948), and at the Centre m√©dico-p√©dagogique at the Universit√© de Paris (1948-1949). In 1949, she married the Canadian philosopher Vianney D√©carie. In 1949, Gouin-D√©carie returned to teach psychology and complete her dissertation at the Universit√© de Montr√©al, where she would remain for the rest of her career. She completed her PhD in 1960. She earned the title of full professor in 1965 and, after her retirement, professor emeritus in 1991. == Research == Gouin-D√©carie conducted research on children's development. Her dissertation, Emotional Intelligence in Young Children, reconciled the developmental theories of Jean Piaget and Sigmund Freud. This work was published as Intelligence and Affectivity in Early Childhood, and included a foreword by Piaget. It was later translated into several languages. In the 1960s, Gouin-D√©carie led a longitudinal study of children born to mothers who had taken thalidomide during their pregnancy. Her work assessed the psychological and emotional health of these children, and received international attention. Gouin-D√©carie's later research examined topics of early social development, including infants' responses to strangers and toddlers' perspective-taking skills. == Awards and honours == In 1969, Gouin-D√©carie was named a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada. She was named an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1971. She was named a Distinguished Fellow of the International Society for Infant Study in 1990.

Son of Francisco dos Santos and Maria Benedita de Lima Santos, he lived his childhood at the Coruputuba farm. He has shown interest in music since he was a child. When he turned six, her older sister, Fia, gave her a Beatles record, a simple compact, and he immediately began to sing along with a cousin. One day, in the farm hen, he made a battery of paint cans, broomstick mics, wooden guitars with strings of thin wire, and the puleiro made a grandstand and also a flap. In the 1980s, Dunga had many problems with drugs and drinks. But at the age of eighteen he returned to the Catholic Church and married. He grew professionally, becoming a professional mechanic. He was an animator of a prayer group, and at that time already married to Edin√©ia, he had his first son, Felipe. Today, the couple has two more daughters: Priscila and Ana Carolina. He received an invitation to live in Can√ß√£o Nova in 1991, beginning his career as a missionary of the Can√ß√£o Nova Community, where he gained a great deal of focus on dealing with youth, especially with the movement PHN (Por Hoje N√£o Vou Mais Pecar). According to the singer himself, the PHN arose from the experience acquired by him in the visits to prison, Casa Foundation, houses to support the HIV virus, in addition to his own life history. The idea grew stronger when Dunga heard a lecture in which Father Jonas Abib, founder of Can√ß√£o Nova, spoke to the young people.

STAR has been touted as Shanghai‚Äôs equivalent to America‚Äôs Nasdaq, with state media alluding to its goal as giving Chinese science and technology companies greater access to capital markets. As of July 2020, it is Asia‚Äôs most valuable stock market, valued at more than US $400 billion. == History  Proposal and Purpose === On November 5, 2018, Chinese President Xi Jinping delivered a speech, announcing that China will \\"launch a science and technology innovation board (‚ÄòSSE STAR Market‚Äô) and the pilot registration-based IPO system at the Shanghai Stock Exchange.\\" The delivery was made in the midst of the China‚ÄìU.S. Trade War. On July 22, 2019, the STAR Market began operations as a board of the Shanghai Stock Exchange, 7 months after the announcement of its creation. The purpose of the board is to support \\"sci-tech and innovative enterprises that align with national strategies, hold core and breakthrough technologies, and enjoy a high degree of market recognition\\" in raising capital. === Rules of Listing === To attract technology companies, STAR allows the listing of companies with multiple share classes, Red Chip companies already listed abroad, and currently unprofitable companies. As of August 2020, is viewed to be in a strong position to attract listings from the US, which is in a trade war with China and announced sanctions on Chinese companies such as Huawei and TikTok. The listing requirements in STAR is based on registration and disclosure rather than approval. Regulators are to have limited roles in the listing process, and would have no say over how shares are priced (e.g. as a multiple of the price to earnings ratio) or when they came to market, unlike other stock market in mainland China. A system based on registration and disclosure is seen as more market-oriented and more in line with the system in markets like the United States.Yan, Li, and Yang Gan. \\"The IPO Registration System in America Legal Regimes: Origin, Structure and Controversy‚Äî‚ÄîOn the Transplantation and Creation for Our Registration System Reform [J].\\" Journal of Comparative Law 6 (2014). Regulators hoped the experiment can offer Chinese companies more access to financing, thereby allowing the financial system to support and bolster the real economy. The Chinese government wanted STAR to experiment with the registration-based listing process as a pilot for potential reforms in the wider Chinese stock market. At the time, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) has the power to approve or reject IPOs in China. Requirements on size and sustained profitability meant that many Chinese companies are unable to list domestically and were forced to list abroad, particularly in the United States and Hong Kong. Since 1993, 354 Chinese companies have listed in the U.S., raising a total of $88.5 billion. In the period of January to August in 2020, Chinese companies raised $5.23 billion in U.S. initial public offerings. === Operation === In March 2019, the Shanghai Stock Exchange began accepting applications for the first round of STAR listings. Until July, 149 technology and science companies signed up to list their stocks on its debut, aiming to raise a total of RMB 128.8bn ($18.7bn). The first round of subscriptions took place between June 27 and July 21, with 25 listed companies, 264 institutional investors and over 3 million individual investors participating. The first 25 companies to list on the exchange raised Rmb 37 billion collectively, through the issuance of new shares that closed their first trading day on STAR Market. Among the first companies to list on its first day of trading were chipmakers Anji and Montage Technology. STAR Market allows investors to trade who have an account balance of at least Rmb500,000 ($73,000), and who have two years of trading history. The Shanghai Stock Exchange and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges permit main board stock prices to move 44 per cent on their first day of trading, after which they are limited to moves of up to 10 per cent. By contrast, the Star Market has no limits on share price movements during a stock‚Äôs first five days. Its shares surged by 520% in its debut. As of July 2019, the P/E multiple for the 30 Star stocks listed is over 100, seen as very high. Listings have slowed considerably since its debut, as regulators seek to avoid approving companies that could cause reputational damage to President Xi Jinping, who unveiled plans for the market. In March 2020, the Chinese Securities Law, which governs the issuance of securities, was amended. The new law will adopt a registration system for all IPOs after testing the system in STAR and deeming it to be successful. In July 2020, STAR hit a record level in the value of new listings. Companies raised more than US $7 billion in July 2020, a 46% increase compared with July 2019. Notable listings in July 2020 included publicly-held semiconductor manufacturer SMIC, which was China's biggest share sale in a decade. Ant Financial, a FinTech company and affiliate of Alibaba Group, has plans of an IPO in STAR. Ant Financial is reporting seeking to raise $30 billion, making it potentially one of the biggest IPOs in history. == References == Category:Stock exchanges in China Category:Shanghai Stock Exchange Category:2019 establishments in China ","title":"Shanghai Stock Exchange STAR Market"},{"id":"61337745","text":"PhytobiaLioy, P (1864) I ditteri distribuite secondo un nuovo metodo di classificazione naturale.

It was released in 1995.Offenbach, Jacques: Arias and Overtures, cond. Antonio de Almeida, RCA Victor Red Seal CD 09026681162, 1995 ==Recording== The album was digitally recorded on 16-18 December 1994 in the City Halls, Glasgow. ==Critical reception== Jacques Offenbach and his only son, Auguste, in 1865 The operetta critic Andrew Lamb reviewed the album in Gramophone in February 1996. Antonio de Almeida's anthology, he wrote, covered \\"a good cross-section of familiar and unfamiliar Offenbach\\". As well as music from the often staged La belle H√©l√®ne, La grande duchesse de G√©rolstein and La P√©richole, the album included excerpts from scores on the dustier shelves of opera houses' libraries. From La fille du tambour-major, for example, there was a martial number for the eponymous Drum-Major's daughter. From Pomme d'api, there were two mischievous songs for the maid-cum-mistress. And from Madame l'archiduc, there was the very obscure tour de force in which \\"the mystified heroine attempts to disentangle the letters 'S. A. D. E.' whispered to her by conspirators, and ends up reciting the entire alphabet\\". The album's soloist, Frederica von Stade, \\"[moved] with grace and majesty through these numbers written for a range of Offenbach's leading ladies\\", but she was more successful in some items than in others. She was outstandingly good in the \\"succulent\\" waltz-rondeau from La vie parisienne, and in the very well known \\"Amours divins!\\" from La belle H√©l√®ne. In \\"Ah! Que les hommes sont b√™tes!\\" from La P√©richole, however, she \\"[failed] to capture all the bite of the Meilhac and Hal√©vy text ... in the way of predecessors such as Suzanne Lafaye\\". The album's purely instrumental items were also performed well without quite attaining to perfection. It was good to have an opportunity to hear the overture to \\"La romance de la rose\\", which \\"begins with 'The last rose of summer' and develops into a lively allegretto\\". And the overtures to Barbe-bleue and La grande duchesse de G√©rolstein \\"[bubbled] along engagingly in their authentic original Parisian form\\". But de Almeida had shown that he could elicit even more \\"sparkle and excitement\\" from Offenbach's jeux d'esprit in an earlier anthology that he had recorded with Philips in 1988. All in all, though, his new collection was a disc of \\"considerable charm\\".Lamb, Andrew: Gramophone, February 1996, p. 105https://www.gramophone.co.uk/review/offenbach-arias-and-overtures BBC Music Magazine reviewed the album in 1998. \\"Von Stade has a special feeling for French music,\\" their critic wrote, \\"especially operetta, to which her light and graceful mezzo brings just the right touch of chic.\\"BBC Music Magazine, Vol. 6, 1998, p. 10 David Shengold reviewed the album in Opera News in 2016. \\"The all-Offenbach collection\\", he wrote, \\"...featuring de Almeida in strong, stylish support, shows anew von Stade's mastery of Gallic texts, here in an ever-shifting emotional range. All-Offenbach programmes can trap lesser artists: this collection is recommendable as an introduction to the composer.\\"https://www.operanews.com/Opera_News_Magazine/2016/12/Recordings/Frederica_von_Stade__The_Complete_Columbia_Recital_Albums.html ==CD track listing== Jacques Offenbach (1819-1880) Arias and Overtures La P√©richole (Paris, 1868; libretto by Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Hal√©vy) * 1 (2:39) Ouverture * 2 (3:18) La lettre de la P√©richole: \\"Oh! mon cher aimant, je te jure\\" * 3 (2:55) \\"Que veulent dires ces col√®res...Ah! que les hommes sont b√™tes!\\" * 4 (2:06) Griserie-ariette: \\"Ah! quel d√Æner je viens de faire\\" * 5 (3:07) Entracte La fille du tambour-major (Paris, 1879; libretto by Alfred Duru and Henri Chivot) * 6 (2:41) Chanson de la fille du tambour-major: \\"Que m'importe un titre √©clatant\\" La belle H√©l√®ne (Paris, 1864; libretto by Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Hal√©vy) * 7 (4:13) \\"Amours divins!

It relates the story of a serious saturation diving accident in 2012, when diver Chris Lemons had his umbilical cable severed and became trapped around 100 metres under the sea without heat or light, and with only the small amount of breathing gas in his backup tank. == Plot summary == The documentary uses genuine footage and audio recorded at the time of the accident on the divers' radios and body cameras, supplemented with interviews of several of the individuals involved, as well as some reconstructed footage, to tell the story of the accident. Chris Lemons, along with his colleagues Duncan Allcock and David Yuasa, were carrying out repairs 100m below the surface of the North Sea, supported by the support vessel Bibby Topaz. The vessel's dynamic positioning system failed, causing it to drift in rough seas, dragging the divers away from the area they were working and eventually snapping the umbilical tether that provided Lemons with heliox to breathe, as well as hot water to heat his suit, power for his light, and a radio link to the surface. He was left with only the few minutes of breathable gas contained in the cylinders he wore on his back. For reasons that are unclear to Lemons and his colleagues, but attributed in part to the cold water and having been breathing air with a high partial pressure of oxygen, Lemons survived for around 30 minutes while he was located by a remote underwater vehicle and then by Yuasa, who was able to pull him back onboard the diving bell. == Reception == Reviews of the documentary were mixed. Empire Magazine gave it 3 stars, describing it as 'a great story' but comparing it unfavourably to similar survival documentaries such as Touching the Void. The Financial Times awarded 4 stars, and called it a 'powerful documentary'. == Distribution == Last Breath was distributed in the UK by Dogwoof and was released simultaneously in cinemas and on Netflix on 5 April 2019. In France the documentary was distributed by Arte on 11 September 2019 with the title Le survivant des abysses. == References == Category:British documentary films Category:British films ","title":"Last Breath (2019 film)"},{"id":"61337827","text":"Daniel R. Lucey is an American physician, researcher, senior scholar and adjunct professor of infectious diseases at Georgetown University, and a research associate in anthropology at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, where he has co-organised an exhibition on eight viral outbreaks. Lucey comes from a military family in California. He graduated in psychology from Dartmouth College in 1977, and after gaining an M.D. in 1982, he worked with people in San Francisco who had a previously unknown disease, later known as HIV/AIDS. He subsequently gained a masters in public health from Harvard School of Public Health. He spent much of the 1990s studying HIV and vaccines. As chief of infectious diseases at the Washington Hospital Center, he had worked on preparations on what to do should there be an intentional release of an infectious agent. This came into operation when following the September 11 attacks of 2001, stockpiles of antibiotics were ready for the subsequent anthrax attacks. He later devised a staging system for inhalation anthrax and advocated the stockpiling of chest drains for its treatment should toxic fluid accumulate around the lungs. In 2003, Lucey was involved in a campaign to administer smallpox vaccinations to hundreds of thousands of workers. The following year, he gave testimony following reports of high lead levels in Washington DC's public water system. The 'Lead Free Drinking Water Act of 2004' was introduced the following month. He has analysed, monitored and responded to several emerging infectious diseases, including the SARS outbreaks of 2003 in China, Hong Kong and Canada, the subsequent H5N1 bird flu in South East Asia and Egypt, H1N1 flu in Egypt, nipah virus in Bangladesh, MERS in the Middle East and Republic of Korea, Ebola in Western Africa, Zika in Brazil, yellow fever in China, chikungunya in Pakistan, H7N9 in China and plague in Madagascar, followed by the 2018‚Äì20 Ebola epidemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease, caused by SARS-CoV-2, which began in 2019. His awards include the 2001 Walter Reed Medal, and the United States Department of the Army's Commander's Award for Public Service, for the care he gave to those injured at The Pentagon on September 11, 2001. ==Early life and education== Daniel R. Lucey was born at Castle Air Force Base, into a military family in Merced County, California and spent his childhood in various parts of the United States including Florida, Ohio, Virginia, South Carolina, Pennsylvania and North Dakota. In 1973, he joined Dartmouth College, from where he graduated in psychology in 1977.Lucey, Daniel R. (2015). Daniel R. Lucey: Curriculum Vitae. He then gained admission to study medicine at Dartmouth Medical School, now known as Geisel School of Medicine, when as a medical student in 1979, he spent two months at the Baragwanath Hospital, Soweto, South Africa, recalling later that this was his \\"first exposure to infectious disease\\". ==Early medical career== UCSF Medical Center He gained an M.D. in 1982, following which he began his early training at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), where he worked with people who were suffering from a previously unknown disease, later known as HIV/AIDS. In 1988 he gained a masters in public health from Harvard School of Public Health, where he had gained a fellowship of the Infectious Diseases Society of America. From 1988 to 1990 he was attending physician at United States Air Force, Wilford Hall Medical Center, San Antonio, Texas. From 1992 to 1998, he was attending physician in infectious diseases and internal medicine at the National Naval Medical Center, Bethesda. In 1993, while he was studying HIV at the National Institutes of Health campus, he became a fellow of the American College of Physicians, Three years later, he was appointed to work on biodefense vaccines, vaccines for hepatitis A and B, and vaccines for Lyme disease and HIV, at the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Subsequently, in 1998, he was appointed to HIV research as viral immunologist at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. ==Washington Hospital Center== In 2001, as chief of infectious diseases at the Washington Hospital Center during the September 11 attacks, he had worked on preparations on what to do should there be an intentional release of an infectious agent. ===Anthrax=== Inhalational anthrax, widening of mediastinum Lucey contributed to the preparedness of the hospital for the subsequent 2001 anthrax attacks by arranging stock piles of antibiotics. Several media companies and two U.S. senators had received letters containing anthrax spores, infecting 22 people in total, five of whom died. Of these cases, 11 involved the skin and 11 were in the lungs (inhalation anthrax). Antibiotics needed to be given quickly. Noting that the first case of anthrax presented with meningitis, Lucey emphasised that should a diagnosis of anthrax meningitis ever be made, a public health response should be triggered. He has published works on inhalation anthrax, particularly the staging of the disease which he divided into four: \\"asymptomatic, early-prodromal, intermediate- progressive and late-fulminant\\", with survival being more likely with earlier administration of antibiotics. Learning from the experiences of medical professionals who treated the victims of the 1979 anthrax outbreak in the city of Sverdlovsk, he developed an understanding of treating anthrax affecting the lungs by draining the resulting infected and toxic lung fluid, and injecting antibiotics directly into the pleural space. As a result, he has endorsed the stock-piling of items ready to perform pleural drainage should it be necessary. A later study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, showed the importance of detecting anthrax early and administering antibiotics within hours of a bioterrorist attack, as well as stockpiling chest drains to perform lung fluid drainage. ===Smallpox vaccination program=== Smallpox vaccine In 2003, Lucey was involved in a campaign to administer smallpox vaccinations to hundreds of thousands of workers. Despite the mounting cost of the campaign and doubts about it being necessary, Lucey in 2003, as director of the Center for Biologic Counterterrorism and Emerging Diseases at the Washington Hospital Center, endorsed the vaccination of healthcare workers and stated that \\"the threat is definitely real. This is a dangerous time,\\" and advised \\"for ourselves to be protected, and to then be able to take care of patients and contribute to a large-scale vaccination program.\\" ===Lead contamination=== In February 2004, a few days after starting work with biodefense at the Washington DC department of health, Lucey was present at a taskforce meeting on the high lead levels in Washington DC's public water system. He became involved in the subsequent investigations and gave testimony on April 7, 2004 to the Fisheries, Wildlife, and Water Subcommittee. The 'Lead Free Drinking Water Act of 2004' was introduced the following month. ==Georgetown University Medical Center== Georgetown University Medical Center Since 2004, as adjunct professor of medicine and infectious diseases at Georgetown University Medical Center (GUMC), he has taught students on bioterrorism and emerging infectious disease. In 2014, he became a senior scholar with the O‚ÄôNeill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University. In the same year, as an anthropology research associate, he co-organised an exhibition on epidemics at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History. Along with the Institute's team, he worked with 30 colleagues from around the world to produce an exhibit of eight viral outbreaks, beginning with the quote \\"our world is interconnected more than ever before ‚Äì by global travel and trade, technology, and even our viruses\\", and ending with \\"what's next is already here; we just haven't recognized it yet\\". ==Emerging infectious diseases== Science writer, Laura Stephenson Carter, wrote in the 2012 alumni album of Dartmouth College, that for over 30 years Lucey has been \\"chasing things you wouldn't want to catch\\". He coined the term \\"pan-epidemic\\", and between 2003 and 2016, he spent time researching infectious disease outbreaks in several countries. ===SARS 2003=== In 2003 he worked on the SARS outbreaks in Guangzhou China, Hong Kong and Toronto, Canada, where the affected hospitals came to be known as SARS hospitals. At the time, regarding personal protective equipment, Lucey stated that \\"getting all hospital workers to comply with standard infection control procedures‚Äîall the time‚Äîwas a key to stopping an outbreak of SARS in 2003 ... someone stood there and monitored you to make sure you followed, step by step by step, putting it on properly and taking it off.\\" ===Bird flu=== Subsequently, he worked on the H5N1 bird flu outbreak in Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam and Egypt, and the H1N1 flu in Egypt. ===MERS=== MERS Coronavirus Particle He worked on MERS in the Middle East and Republic of Korea. Having studied MERS, he considers it ‚Äúin terms of a super-spreading event rather than a super spreader‚Äù. ===Ebola in Western Africa=== He treated people with ebola during the ebola outbreak in Liberia, Guinea and Sierre Leone, where he helped in the isolation unit at Connaught Hospital in Freetown.Phillip, Abbey. Rise in new cases shows Ebola has not released its deadly grip. The Washington Post, June 12, 2015 ===Zika=== In 2016, in the Journal of the American Medical Association, Lucey and his colleague Larry Gostin called for the zika epidemic in the Americas to be announced a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), criticizing the WHO for not escalating their response sooner, and stating that \\"it is far better to be overprepared than to wait until a zika epidemic spins out of control\\". ===Nipah virus=== Lucey visited Bangladesh during its nipah virus outbreak of 2004, caused by the consumption of date palm sap contaminated by fruit bats. More than a decade later, when in 2018, nipah occurred in Kerala, India, where it had never previously emerged, he responded that ‚Äúthe medical and public health response in Kerala prevented it from becoming much worse‚Äù. His report in 2018, published in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases, called the incident in Kerala \\"a bellwether of that potential risk of a Nipah pandemic\\". He warned of a potential epidemic of nipah virus, and stated at the time that \\"immediate enhanced preparation measures should include training on personal protective equipment (PPE), infection prevention and control, diagnostic testing, and clinical management protocols\\". The report advocated the need for countries that had no past experience of nipah outbreaks, to make preparations. ===Yellow fever=== On the question of whether Asia will ever encounter an outbreak of yellow fever, Lucey showed concern when, in 2016, an outbreak in Angola led to several infected travellers reaching China. He worked on yellow fever during that outbreak, highlighting difficulties should mass quantities of vaccine be required. ===Other emerging infectious diseases=== Other involvements have included the chikungunya outbreak in Pakistan, H7N9 influenza in China and the plague in Madagascar. He was one expert who called for the 2018-20 ebola epidemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to be declared a PHEIC in July 2019. ===COVID-19 pandemic=== SARS- CoV-2 (yellow) (image via NIAID Rocky Mountain Laboratories (RML). Reporting on his views of the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease, caused by SARS- CoV-2, which began in 2019, Lucey recalled that \\"the SARS outbreak in Toronto in 2003 started with one missed case\\". The new coronavirus outbreak, reported by the World Health Organization on December 31, 2019 has been associated with the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, a wet market in Wuhan, China. When Chinese researchers published their report in January 2020 in The Lancet, on the first 41 confirmed cases of the new coronavirus, Lucey hypothesised that if the data was accurate, with 12 of the 41 with no direct link to the market and the earliest reported onset of symptoms being December 1, 2019, and with a calculated incubation period of up to two weeks, the virus may have already been quietly circulating among humans from at least November 2019 and \\"the virus came into that marketplace before it came out of that marketplace\\". His analysis of the Chinese report was published in a paper titled \\"Coronavirus ‚Äî Unknown Source, Unrecognized Spread, and Pandemic Potential\\" in Think Global in January 2020. ==Awards== In 1982, while at Dartmouth Medical School, he gained membership to the AOA Medical Honor Society. In 1988, he received the young investigator award from the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.Membership Directory: Awards. American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, p 131. For his work in preparing the city of Washington for the anthrax attacks, Lucey received the Walter Reed Medal in 2001. The following year the United States Department of the Army awarded him the Commander's Award for Public Service, for the care he gave to those injured at The Pentagon on September 11, 2001. In 2003, he received a Distinguished Service Award from the District of Columbia Hospital Association for Bioterrorism Preparedness. In the same year, the Medical Society of the District of Columbia awarded him their Meritorious Service Award. == Selected publications == * \\"Development and evaluation of a quantitative, touch-down, real-time PCR assay for diagnosing Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia\\".

Kromhout Museum is located on the Nieuwe Vaart. On this site, the Westkap is still used as a shipyard but the Oosthal is furnished as a museum. The Oosterkerk is also on the Nieuwe Vaart. ==Description== From the Kattenburgerplein, in front of the Maritime Museum, the canal runs in a southeastern direction between the Oostelijke Eilanden (Eastern Islands) on the north side and the Kadijken on the south side. The Eastern Islands are separated from the city by the Nieuwe Vaart and can only be reached via bridges over the Nieuwe Vaart. At the Dageraadsbrug, the Nieuwe Vaart connects to the Singelgracht and continues eastwards along the Cruquiskade and the Zeeburgerpad, to the Zeeburgersluis. This eastern part of the Nieuwe Vaart runs parallel to the Singelgracht and forms the southern boundary of the Eastern Docklands (Oostelijk Havengebied).\\"De Oostelijke Eilanden: Kattenburg, Wittenburg, Oostenburg\\", Theo Bakker's Domein Along the western part of the canal, on the north side (on the Eastern Islands), there is a street that changes name four times from northwest to southeast: Kattenburgerplein - Kattenburgergracht - Wittenburgergracht - Oostenburgergracht. Together they form the Eilandboulevard A street called Nieuwevaart runs along the northern part of the south side, along the southern part the Kruithuisstraat. Nieuwevaart 5-9 is the headquarters of the municipal Transport and Transport Infrastructure Department. The northern end of the Nieuwe Vaart is marked by the Kattenburger Bridge, which connects the Prins Hendrikkade with the Kattenburgerplein. Halfway the western part of the canal is a bridge called the Overhaalsgang. The Dageraadsbrug, part of a busy traffic square, is located at the point where the Nieuwe Vaart connects with the Singelgracht and turns to the east. There are three bridges across the eastern part of the Nieuwe Vaart, including the bridge in Panamalaan. There is also a railway bridge for the railway line between Amsterdam Centraal station and Amsterdam Muiderpoort railway station. ==History== The Nieuwe Vaart was created in the 17th century when the island of Kattenburg was built outside the dykes. The island crossed so much of the IJ that silting problems arose. The Nieuwe Vaart canal was dug in 1649 to ensure a good flow of water.\\"Typisch Amsterdam\\" - Oostelijke eilanden\\", Amsterdam.nl Originally there was only one bridge over the Nieuwe Vaart to the Eastern Islands. By lifting this Kattenburger bridge, the residents could shut themselves off from the outside world. This came in handy with the Bijltjesoproer, a riot in 1787 by Orangist ship carpenters in Kattenburg against the patriot city council. The Nieuwe Vaart also played a role in the 1917 Potato riots. A barge with potatoes was sent via the Nieuwe Vaart to the Entrepotdok on 30 June. A group of women followed the barge and started throwing stones, at which mounted police started shooting in the air.Mieke Krijger, \\"Het Aardappeloproer in 1917\\", Legermuseum The western part of the Nieuwe Vaart has been used for shipbuilding and repair since the 17th century. With the arrival of steam ships in the second half of the 19th century, more and more port activities were relocated there. The Nieuwe Vaart became the harbor basin for all large ships, so that most yards made way for warehouses.\\"Kattenburg/Wittenburg\\", Wijkcentrum Oostelijke Binnenstad The Nieuwe Vaart Association was established in January 2011. This association represents the interests of the residents of houseboats in the western part of the Nieuwe Vaart. The association was founded by houseboat residents as a result of redevelopment plans by the Centrum district where most of the berths for houseboats in the Nieuwe Vaart would disappear.Vereniging de Nieuwe Vaart File:Nieuwevaart, foto 12 Jacob Olie (max res).jpg The canal in 1895 File:Nieuwe vaart amsterdam 2.jpg The Nieuwe Vaart, looking in a southeastern direction.
