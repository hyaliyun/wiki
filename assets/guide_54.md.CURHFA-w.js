This old cable management technique, taught to generations of lineworkers, is still used in some modern applications since it does not create obstructions along the length of the cable, avoiding the handling problems of cables groomed by plastic or hook-and-loop cable ties. Cable lacing uses a thin cord, traditionally made of waxed linen, to bind together a group of cables using a series of running lockstitches. Flat lacing tapes made of modern materials such as nylon, polyester, Teflon, fiberglass, and Nomex are also available with a variety of coatings to improve knot holding. PABX with extensive cable lacing ==Styles== The lacing begins and ends with a whipping or other knot to secure the free ends. Wraps are spaced relative to the overall harness diameter to maintain the wiring in a tight, neat bundle, and the ends are then neatly trimmed. In addition to continuous or running lacing, there are a variety of lacing patterns used in different circumstances. In some cases stand-alone knots called spot ties are also used. For lashing large cables and cable bundles to support structures in telecommunications applications, there are two named cable lacing styles: the \\"Chicago stitch\\" and \\"Kansas City stitch\\". Some organizations have in-house standards to which cable lacing must conform, for example NASA specifies its cable lacing techniques in chapter 9 of NASA-STD-8739.4.See \\"External Links\\" section for these documents. ==Examples== File:Cable lacing close-up 2.jpgTraditional waxed cord lacing made with a series of running lockstitches based on the figure-eight knot Image:Cable-lacing-lockstitch-marline-hitching- ABOK-3115.jpgThis style of continuous lacing, also called \\"marline hitching\\", is based on a series of overhand knots.

Sporting a 1050cc 4-stroke three- cylinder engine, an alloy-beam frame and a single-sided swingarm, the Sprint ST competed effectively in the market against the Honda VFR800. In 2010 the Sprint ST was succeeded by the Triumph Sprint GT. ==Design and development955 cc (T695) === The Sprint ST was first introduced in 1999 as a complete redesign of the earlier Sprint 900 (1993‚Äì1998) styled by Rod Scivyer. It used the 955 cc straight-three engine similar to those found in the contemporaneous Speed Triple and Daytona models, only slightly detuned for smoother power delivery. Claimed power was , later increased to . The model's appearance remained mostly unchanged from its introduction in 1999. An engine revamp with the assistance of Lotus in 2002 increased output to at 9100rpm and of torque at 5100rpm from a lighter engine--the bike is dry. ===1,050 cc=== In 2005, Triumph introduced a redesigned Sprint ST based around the same inline triple, increased in stroke to yield a displacement of and with a new fuel injection system. Power output increased to (123 hp / 90 Kw @ 9250 rpm), with torque of (104 Nm / 77 ft-lb @ 5000 rpm). The 1050 ST redesigned chassis had a shorter wheelbase, the instrument cluster was modernised with miles-per-gallon and miles-to-empty displays, triple exhaust pipes were tucked under the seat, the headlights were completely redesigned and LED tail-lights added. Also, a range of options including pannier mounts and anti-lock brakes (ABS 2006 onwards) became available. In 2007 some changes were made to the standard trim of the Sprint ST, including colour-matched panniers, handlebar risers and an improved windscreen. In 2008 the original composite fuel tank was replaced by a steel item of the same size and shape to enable the use of magnetic tank bags. Other 2008 changes included a new headlamp design and new footrests with more durable rubber. The Sprint ST continued in production until 2010 , when it was replaced by the Sprint GT. ==Triumph Sprint GT== Triumph Sprint GT 1050 In 2010, the Triumph Sprint GT (Grand Tourer) was launched with a change of emphasis.Triumph Sprint GT Compared to the class-leading ST (Sports Tourer), the GT was more focused on two-up touring, with a longer wheelbase, more weight and a better pillion provision. The engine was a revised version of the 1050 triple with more power (128 hp / 96 kW @ 9200 rpm) and torque (108 Nm / 80 ft-lb @ 6300 rpm) though the peak torque was produced at significantly higher revs than before. The power changes were as a result of use of an uprated ECU, the elimination of the 1050 ST's signature triple under seat exhaust in favour of a side-mounted 3-into-1 exhaust, and a revised throttle body intake. The highest gear was made seven percent taller than the ST to allowing for more relaxed highway cruising, giving an engine speed at a steady 110 km/h (68 MPH) of just over 4,000 rpm. The GT chassis was nearly 6 inches longer than the ST, with an overall length of 2260mm (89.0 inches) compared to the ST with 2114mm (83.2 inches); and the GT's wheelbase is 1537mm (60.5 inches) compared to the ST's 1457mm (57.4 inches). The GT's front and rear suspension were Showa units. The front forks had stiffer springs to cope with the extra weight, while the rear suspension featured spring preload and rebound damping adjustability. These modifications added to the weight of the bike, which now had a hefty kerb weight of . The GT retained the 2008 ST headlamp design, and had the anti-lock brakes (ABS) that had been optional on the ST 1050. The longer chassis allowed pillion footpegs to be repositioned to be more accommodating for a passenger. Removing the ST's under-seat silencers to a conventional position allowed the reshaped pillion seat to be lower. Uprated hard panniers were a standard fitting, with a 55 litre top box available as a factory option. These panniers were more robust and much larger than the ST's: (31 litres each vs. 22 litres). The GT has changed little since its introduction in 2010, although a new SE Special Edition included as standard previously optional accessories such as a gel \\"Comfort Seat\\". After 2014 the GT was no longer available outside the UK , but as of 2017, the Triumph Sprint GT SE is still in production for the home Market. ==Reception== Motor Cycle News called the pre-2005 Sprint a \\"superb British all rounder which pipped Honda‚Äôs VFR800 simply by using a straight bat when the VFR tried all kinds of trick but ultimately unnecessary technology\\".

The pink line is the cubic nullcline and the yellow line is the linear nullcline. In this case I_{\\\\rm ext}=0.5, a=0.8, b=0.7. The FitzHugh-Nagumo model (FHN), named after Richard FitzHugh (1922-2007) who suggested the system in 1961 and J. Nagumo et al. who created the equivalent circuit the following year, describes a prototype of an excitable system (e.g., a neuron). The FHN Model is an example of a relaxation oscillator because, if the external stimulus I_{\\\\text{ext}} exceeds a certain threshold value, the system will exhibit a characteristic excursion in phase space, before the variables v and w relax back to their rest values. This behaviour is typical for spike generations (a short, nonlinear elevation of membrane voltage v, diminished over time by a slower, linear recovery variable w) in a neuron after stimulation by an external input current. The equations for this dynamical system read : \\\\dot{v}=v-\\\\frac{v^3}{3} - w + RI_{\\\\rm ext} : \\\\tau \\\\dot{w} = v+a-b w. The dynamics of this system can be nicely described by zapping between the left and right branch of the cubic nullcline. The FitzHugh-Nagumo model is a simplified 2D version of the Hodgkin-Huxley model which models in a detailed manner activation and deactivation dynamics of a spiking neuron. In the original papers of FitzHugh, this model was called Bonhoeffer-van der Pol oscillator (named after Karl-Friedrich Bonhoeffer and Balthasar van der Pol) because it contains the van der Pol oscillator as a special case for a=b=0 . The equivalent circuit was suggested by Jin-ichi Nagumo, Suguru Arimoto, and Shuji Yoshizawa. ==See also== *Autowave *Biological neuron model *Computational neuroscience *Hodgkin-Huxley model *Morris‚ÄìLecar model *Reaction‚Äìdiffusion *Theta model ==References== ==Further reading== *FitzHugh R.

The central goal of GLODAP is to generate a global climatology of the World Ocean's carbon cycle for use in studies of both its natural and anthropogenically-forced states. GLODAP is funded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the U.S. Department of Energy, and the National Science Foundation. The first GLODAP release (v1.1) was produced from data collected during the 1990s by research cruises on the World Ocean Circulation Experiment, Joint Global Ocean Flux Study and Ocean-Atmosphere Exchange Study programmes. The second GLODAP release (v2) extended the first using data from cruises from 2000‚Äì2013. The data are available both as individual \\"bottle data\\" from sample sites, and as interpolated fields on a standard longitude, latitude, depth grid. ==Dataset== The GLODAPv1.1 climatology contains analysed fields of \\"present day\\" (1990s) dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), alkalinity, carbon-14 (14C), CFC-11 and CFC-12.Key, R.M., Kozyr, A., Sabine, C.L., Lee, K., Wanninkhof, R., Bullister, J., Feely, R.A., Millero, F., Mordy, C. and Peng, T.-H. (2004). A global ocean carbon climatology: Results from GLODAP. Global Biogeochemical Cycles 18, GB4031 The fields consist of three- dimensional, objectively-analysed global grids at 1¬∞ horizontal resolution, interpolated onto 33 standardised vertical intervalsStandardised intervals are at 0, 10, 20, 30, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 200, 250, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000, 1100, 1200, 1300, 1400, 1500, 1750, 2000, 2500, 3000, 3500, 4000, 4500, 5000, 5500 m from the surface (0 m) to the abyssal seafloor (5500 m). In terms of temporal resolution, the relative scarcity of the source data mean that, unlike the World Ocean Atlas, averaged fields are only produced for the annual time-scale. The GLODAP climatology is missing data in certain oceanic provinces including the Arctic Ocean, the Caribbean Sea, the Mediterranean Sea and Maritime Southeast Asia. Additionally, analysis has attempted to separate natural from anthropogenic DIC, to produce fields of pre-industrial (18th century) DIC and \\"present day\\" anthropogenic CO2. This separation allows estimation of the magnitude of the ocean sink for anthropogenic CO2, and is important for studies of phenomena such as ocean acidification.Orr, J. C. et al. (2005). Anthropogenic ocean acidification over the twenty-first century and its impact on calcifying organisms. Nature 437, 681‚Äì686Raven, J. A. et al. (2005). Ocean acidification due to increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide. Royal Society, London, UK However, as anthropogenic DIC is chemically and physically identical to natural DIC, this separation is difficult. GLODAP used a mathematical technique known as C* (C-star)Gruber, N., Sarmiento, J.L. and Stocker, T.F. (1996). An improved method for detecting anthropogenic CO2 in the oceans, Global Biogeochemical Cycles 10:809‚Äì 837 to deconvolute anthropogenic from natural DIC (there are a number of alternative methods). This uses information about ocean biogeochemistry and CO2 surface disequilibrium together with other ocean tracers including carbon-14, CFC-11 and CFC-12 (which indicate water mass age) to try to separate out natural CO2 from that added during the ongoing anthropogenic transient. The technique is not straightforward and has associated errors, although it is gradually being refined to improve it. Its findings are generally supported by independent predictions made by dynamic models. The GLODAPv2 climatology largely repeats the earlier format, but makes use of the large number of observations of the ocean's carbon cycle made over the intervening period (2000‚Äì2013). The analysed \\"present-day\\" fields in the resulting dataset are normalised to year 2002. Anthropogenic carbon was estimated in GLODAPv2 using a \\"transit-time distribution\\" (TTD) method (an approach using a Green's function). In addition to updated fields of DIC (total and anthropogenic) and alkalinity, GLODAPv2 includes fields of seawater pH and calcium carbonate saturation state (Œ©; omega). The latter is a non- dimensional number calculated by dividing the local carbonate ion concentration by the ambient saturation concentration for calcium carbonate (for the biomineral polymorphs calcite and aragonite), and relates to an oceanographic property, the carbonate compensation depth. Values of this below 1 indicate undersaturation, and potential dissolution, while values above 1 indicate supersaturation, and relative stability. ==Gallery== The following panels show sea surface concentrations of fields prepared by GLODAPv1.1.

The band brought together musicians from different musical styles - folk, country-rock, classical, pop and rock - and theological traditions (Lutheran, Presbyterian and Methodist). The band's name derived from the German for \\"Children of Christ\\", reflecting the Lutheran roots of the lead singer, Robin Mann. It was formed at Scots Church (then Presbyterian) and played regularly in Lutheran, Presbyterian, Methodist, Baptist, Salvation Army, Catholic and Anglican churches, including the weekly student worship service at St Stephen's Lutheran Church, Adelaide. Kindekrist's music reflected both a concern for issues of social justice as well as expressing more spiritual and religious themes. In this, it paralleled the themes of the contemporary US Jesus Movement, which itself spawned the development of Jesus Music that later evolved into Contemporary Christian Music. Two of the band's members, Robin Mann and John Pryzibilla, were arrested during Australian protests against the Vietnam War, while the band's first drummer, Rev Rod Jepsen, was a leader of the Anti-Apartheid campaign against the 1971 Springbok Rugby Tour of Australia. With membership changing over the two decades of the band's life, the core performer and composer was Robin Mann.

Growing to tall by broad, it is an erect herbaceous perennial with slender racemes of white or occasionally pink or purple flowers in summer. ==Names and etymology== Other names and variants include Culver's-root, Culverphysic, Culver's physic, Bowman's root, black root. The Latin specific epithet virginicum means \\"of Virginia\\", referring to a historic definition covering the entire eastern USA and southeastern Canada, (which roughly corresponds to its current distribution). The name \\"Culver's root\\" derives from a certain Dr. Culver who was a pioneer physician of the 18th century and used its bitter roots for purgative purposes. ==Description== The stems are hairless and usually unbranched. The leaves are serrated and arranged in whorls of 3-7 around the stem. The inflorescence is erect with slender and spike-like racemes to about long, giving the flower cluster a candelabra-like appearance. The stamens are crowded and protrude in a brush-like fashion perpendicular to the raceme. The corollas are white and are roughly 2mm in length. These plants flower for about a month from mid-June to late August, depending on the latitude. ==Distribution== Veronicastrum virginicum is found from southern Maine to northwest Florida to northern Louisiana up through Minnesota and somewhat north of the Canada‚ÄìUS border. ==Habitat== Culver's root is frequently found in wet to wet-mesic prairies and sometimes moist upland sites. It is also found in a good number of prairie or native meadow restorations. ==Cultivation== Veronicastrum virginicum is cultivated as an ornamental for temperate gardens in the Eastern and Central United States around its native range. Most native plant nurseries commonly sell this easy and adaptable perennial. Even some conventional nurseries sell this plant, though it is not common yet in American landscapes and gardens. It is fully hardy down to at least , and grows in full sun to part shade and any moist, well-drained soil. It is easy to dig up, divide, and reset like a good number of standard perennials if they get too large or crowded. It stays as an upright clump and does not spread far. Plants rarely need staking; however, older clumps may require this. It can be pruned down in late May or dug up, divided, and reset. This plant does do some self-sowing with its tiny seed. In the UK the cultivar 'Lavendelturm', with lilac flowers, has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. ==Ecology== The larvae of the Culver's root borer moth feed on this plant. ==Notes== ==References== * * ==External links== * Category:Plantaginaceae Category:Flora of Ontario Category:Flora of the United States Category:Flora of the Great Lakes region (North America) Category:Flora of the Northeastern United States Category:Plants described in 1753 Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus Category:Flora of the Southeastern United States ","title":"Veronicastrum virginicum"},{"id":"9106026","text":"Clear Air Turbulence is the second studio album by British jazz rock band Ian Gillan Band, released in 1977 with cover by Chris Foss.

Since Blumenbach, many anthropologists have rejected his theory of five races, citing the enormous complexity of classifying races. The concept of a \\"Malay race\\" differs with that of the ethnic Malays centered on Malaya and parts of the Malay Archipelago's islands of Sumatra and Borneo. ==Etymology== Minangkabau men from West Sumatra, Indonesia The earliest records of the word Melayu or Malayu came from a Chinese record that reported a kingdom named Malayu had sent the envoy to the Chinese court for the first time in 645 CE. It was recorded in the book Tang Huiyao collected by Wang Pu during the Song dynasty.Muljana, Slamet, (2006), Srivijaya, Yogyakarta: LKIS, . Another Chinese source mentioned the kingdom of Malayu. Two books were written by a buddhist monk I-tsing or I Ching (Áæ©Ê∑®; pinyin Y√¨ J√¨ng) (634‚Äì713),Junjiro Takakusu, 1896, A record of the Buddhist Religion as Practised in India and the Malay Archipelago AD 671‚Äì695, by I-tsing, Oxford, London. in his journey from China to India in 671 wherein he reported: Another source dated from a later period mentioned the name Bhumi Malayu, written in the Padang Roco Inscription dated 1286 CE in Dharmasraya, and later in 1347 CE, Adityawarman edited his own inscription inscribed in the Amoghapasa statue, declaring himself the ruler of Malayupura.Muljana, Slamet, (2005), Runtuhnya Kerajaan Hindu-Jawa dan Timbulnya Negara-Negara Islam di Nusantara, Yogyakarta: LKIS, . The Majapahit record, Nagarakretagama dated 1365 CE, mentioned the lands of Melayu dominated by Majapahit\\"Brandes, J.L.A., (1902), NƒÅgarakrƒõtƒÅgama; Lofdicht van Prapanjtja op koning Radjasanagara, Hajam Wuruk, van Madjapahit, naar het eenige daarvan bekende handschrift, aangetroffen in de puri te Tjakranagara op Lombok. From these records the name Malayu seems to be identified with the area around the Batanghari river valley from estuarine to hinterland in present-day Jambi and parts of West Sumatra province. The people inhabiting the Eastern coast of Sumatra and parts of the Malay peninsula identified themselves as Malay with a common language called the Malay language. After the arrival of Europeans in the 16th century, the Europeans identified the native people living on both coasts of the Malacca strait as Malay people. This term extended to neighboring peoples with similar traits. Malays were once referred to as \\"Kun-lun people\\" in various Chinese records. Kunlun originally referred to a fabled mountain range believed to span parts of Tibet and India. It was used by the Chinese in reference to black, wavy-haired barbarians of mountains and jungles from the remote part of the geographically known world. The Champas and Khmers were called Kunlun people by the Chinese before the term was applied to the Malays or more accurately Austronesians as a whole. In 750, Jianzhen (688‚Äì765) noticed the presence of many \\"Brahmans, Persians and Kunluns in Canton\\". The Old Book of Tang reported that \\"every year, Kunlun merchants came in their ships carrying valuable goods to trade with the Chinese\\". ==Definitions== In his 1775 doctoral dissertation titled De generis humani varietate nativa (trams: On the Natural Varieties of Mankind), Blumenbach outlined four main human races by skin color, namely Caucasian (white), Negroid (black), Native American (red), and Mongolian (yellow). By 1795, Blumenbach added another race called 'Malay' which he considered a subcategory of both the Ethiopian and Mongoloid races. The Malay race belonged to those of a \\"brown color: from olive and a clear mahogany to the darkest clove or chestnut brown\\". Blumenbach expanded the term \\"Malay\\" to include the native inhabitants of the Marianas, the Philippines, the Malukus, Sundas, Indochina, as well as Pacific Islands like the Tahitians. He considered a Tahitian skull he had received to be the missing link; showing the transition between the \\"primary\\" race, the Caucasians, and the \\"degenerate\\" race, the Negroids. Blumenbach writes: ==Colonial influences== The view of Malays held by Stamford Raffles had a significant influence on English-speakers, lasting to the present day. He is probably the most important voice who promoted the idea of a ‚ÄòMalay‚Äô race or nation, not limited to the Malay ethnic group, but embracing the people of a large yet unspecified part of the South East Asian archipelago. Raffles formed a vision of Malays as a language-based 'nation', in line with the views of the English Romantic movement at the time, and in 1809 sent a literary essay on the topic to the Asiatic Society. After he mounted an expedition to the former Minangkabau seat of royalty in the Pagaruyung, he declared it was ‚Äòthe source of that power, the origin of that nation, so extensively scattered over the Eastern Archipelago‚Äô. In his later writings he moved the Malays from a nation to a race. ==Indonesia== Ethnic Malay among other ethnic groups in Indonesia. Ethnic Malay is one of the most widely distributed ethnicities in Indonesia. The Malay realm is described in green and other related sub-ethnicities are rendered in darker or lighter green. Malay ethnic groups are depicted as inhabiting the eastern coast of Sumatra and coastal Kalimantan. In Indonesia, the term \\"Malay\\" () is more associated with ethnic Malay than 'Malay race'. It is mostly because Indonesia has other Native Indonesian ethnicities that already consolidated and established their culture and identity who believed they had traditions and languages that are very different from coastal Malay people. Thus, making Malay just as one of myriad Indonesian ethnicities, sharing common status with Javanese (including their sub-ethnic such as Osing and Tenggerese), Sundanese, Minangkabau, Batak tribes, Bugis, Dayak, Acehnese, Balinese, Torajan, etc. The term 'Malay race' was first coined by foreign scientists in colonial times. During the Dutch East Indies era, natives were grouped under the category inlanders or pribumi to describe native Indonesians in contrast to Eurasian Indo people and Asian immigrants (Chinese, Arab and Indian origin). The concept of the Malay race shared in Malaysia and to some degree, the Philippines, also influenced and might be shared by some Indonesians in the spirit of inclusivity and solidarity, commonly coined as puak Melayu or rumpun Melayu. However, the idea and the degree of 'Malayness' also varies in Indonesia, from covering the vast area of Austronesian people to confining it only within the Jambi area where the name 'Malayu' was first recorded. Today, the common identity that binds Malay people together is their language (with variants of dialects that exist among them), Islam and their culture. ==Malaysia== In Malaysia, the early colonial censuses listed separate ethnic groups, such as \\"Malays, Boyanese, Achinese, Javanese, Bugis, Manilamen (Filipino) and Siamese\\". The 1891 census merged these ethnic groups into the three racial categories used in modern Malaysia‚ÄîChinese, ‚ÄòTamils and other natives of India‚Äô, and ‚ÄòMalays and other Natives of the Archipelago‚Äô. This was based upon the European view at the time that race was a biologically based scientific category. For the 1901 census, the government advised the word \\"race\\" should replace \\"nationality\\" wherever it occurs. After a period of generations of being classified in these groups, individual identities formed around the concept of bangsa Melayu (Malay race). For younger generations of people, they saw it as providing unity and solidarity against colonial powers, and non-Malay immigrants. The Malaysian nation was later formed with the bangsa Melayu having the central and defining position within the country. ==Philippines== In the Philippines, many Filipinos consider the term \\"Malay\\" to refer to the indigenous population of the country as well as the indigenous populations of neighboring Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and Brunei. This misconception is due in part to American anthropologist H. Otley Beyer, who had proposed that Filipinos were actually Malays who migrated north from what are now Malaysia and Indonesia. This idea was in turn propagated by Filipino historians and is still taught in many schools. However, the prevalent consensus among contemporary anthropologists, archaeologists, and linguists actually proposes the reverse; namely that ancestors of the Austronesian peoples of the Sunda Islands, Madagascar, and Oceania had originally migrated south from the Philippines during the prehistoric period from an origin in Taiwan. Although Beyer's theory is now completely rejected by modern anthropologists, the misconception remains and most Filipinos still conflate Malay with Austronesian identity, almost always equating the two. There is little knowledge of the fact that the term \\"Malay\\" refers specifically to the ethnic Malays in other Southeast Asian countries. The correct term \\"Austronesian\\" remains unfamiliar to most Filipinos. ==United States== In the United States, the racial classification \\"Malay race\\" was introduced in the early twentieth century into the anti-miscegenation laws of a number of western US states. Anti-miscegenation laws were state laws that prohibited marriage between European Americans and African Americans and in some states also other non-whites. After an influx of Filipino immigrants, these existing laws were amended in a number of western states to prohibit marriage between Caucasians and Filipinos, who were designated as members of the Malay race, and a number of Southern states committed to racial segregation followed suit. Eventually, 9 states (Arizona, California, Georgia, Maryland, Nevada, South Dakota, Utah, Virginia, and Wyoming) explicitly prohibited marriage between Caucasians and Filipinos.Pascoe, Peggy, \\"Miscegenation Law, Court Cases, and Ideologies of \\"Race\\" in Twentieth Century America, The Journal of American History, Vol. 83, June 1996, p. 49 In California, there was some confusion over whether pre-existing state laws prohibiting marriage between whites and \\"Mongolians\\" also prohibited marriage between whites and Filipinos. A 1933 Supreme Court of California case Roldan v. Los Angeles County concluded that such marriages were legal as Filipinos were members of the \\"Malay race\\" and were not enumerated in the list of races for whom marriage with whites was illegal. The California legislature soon after amended the laws to extend the prohibition against interracial marriage to whites and Filipinos. Many anti- miscegenation laws were gradually repealed after the Second World War, starting with California in 1948. In 1967, all remaining bans against interracial marriage were judged to be unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court in Loving v. Virginia and therefore repealed. ==See also== *East Indies *Greater Indonesia *Malay Archipelago *Malay Peninsula *Malay world *Malayness **Bumiputera **Pribumi *Maphilindo *Nusantara *Sinodonty and Sundadonty ==References== Category:Historical definitions of race ","title":"Malay race"},{"id":"9106042","text":"Aminishiki Ry≈´ji (born October 3, 1978, as Ry≈´ji Suginomori) is a retired Japanese sumo wrestler. He made his professional debut in 1997 and reached the top makuuchi division in 2000. He earned twelve special prizes and won eight kinboshi or gold stars for defeating yokozuna. He was twice runner-up in a tournament. The highest rank he reached was sekiwake. After more than 22 years as an active wrestler he retired in July 2019 at the age of 40. He is in the all-time top ten for a number of sumo records, including most career wins, most top division appearances and most tournaments ranked in the top division. He wrestled for Isegahama stable. ==Early life and sumo background== Aminishiki was born in Fukaura, Nishitsugaru District, Aomori Prefecture. He had an extensive sumo pedigree and background. His grandfather was a wrestler for Dewanoumi stable in the past, and his older brother was As≈çfuji who would proceed him joining Ajigawa stable (later renamed Isegahama). Both joined this stable because their father, an innkeeper and fisherman was the cousin of the stable's owner, the former Asahifuji. In his younger years, he was also inspired by the wrestler Kaih≈ç who was five years his senior and went to the same primary, junior and senior high school as he did. He excelled at sumo in ability and determination from very early on, and by the time he joined his stable he was already known as a wrestler with possibly greater potential than his older brother.Knee injury, adverse circumstances affecting Aminishiki's power, also talks of his childhood, page 1 of 2 Nihon Keizai Shinbun, April 20, 2013 Due to his naturally thin physique he found it difficult to put on weight at first and had to be monitored closely by his stablemaster to make sure he was eating enough. ==Career== He made his professional debut in January 1997. He reached the second highest j≈´ry≈ç division after three years in January 2000. He made the top makuuchi division just three tournaments later in July 2000. He won his first special prize in his debut top division tournament, for Fighting Spirit. In January 2003, he scored his first win over a yokozuna by defeating Takanohana, who announced his retirement the next day. He was a runner-up in the May 2003 tournament. In 2004, he briefly fell to j≈´ry≈ç after suffering an injury in the July tournament. Aminishiki has won the prestigious gin≈ç-sh≈ç or Technique Prize on six occasions, and has also earned eight kinboshi or gold stars for defeating yokozuna. Having come close on a number of occasions, Aminishiki finally made his san'yaku debut in November 2006, having chalked up an impressive 11‚Äì4 runner-up record at maegashira 3 rank the previous September. He fell short with 6 wins at komusubi, but remained in the upper maegashira ranks. In July 2007, he returned to komusubi and scored 8‚Äì7, winning his second successive shukun-sh≈ç, or Outstanding Performance Award. This earned him promotion to sekiwake for September 2007. It took him 43 top division tournaments to reach sumo's third highest rank, the fourth slowest rise ever. Aminishiki in May 2009, with his injured right knee taped He won his first eight bouts in his sekiwake debut, leading the race for the championship, although he faltered in the second week and finished with a 10‚Äì5 record. In the November 2007 tournament he won his last three bouts to preserve his sekiwake rank with an 8‚Äì7 score. In January 2008, however, he could win only five matches and fell back to the maegashira ranks. In March 2008 he defeated yokozuna Hakuh≈ç having injured his right knee the day before the match in a loss to Asash≈çry≈´.Ami's Knee ‚Äì Sumo Forum In May 2008 he scored an impressive ten wins and was the only man to defeat Koto≈çsh≈´, the winner of the tournament, which secured him his third Outstanding Performance Prize. Aminishiki returned to the sekiwake rank in January 2009 after winning his fourth Outstanding Performance Prize at komusubi in November 2008. However, he was still wearing a brace on his right knee when he faced yokozuna Asash≈çry≈´ on Day Eight. Asash≈çry≈´ shoved him out of the ring, at which point Aminishiki winced, collapsed and grasped his right knee. He forfeited the next day's bout against Kyokutenh≈ç, and pulled out of the tournament altogether after doctors pronounced he would require at least two weeks to heal. Falling back to the maegashira ranks for the March tournament, he produced a 9‚Äì6 score on his return. He earned his seventh kinboshi, and fourth from Asash≈çry≈´, during the May 2009 tournament. In July 2009 he scored eleven wins and won his fourth Technique Prize, guaranteeing him a return to san'yaku. In September he was ranked at komusubi but just failed to secure his kachi-koshi, falling to Kakury≈´ on the final day to finish 7‚Äì8. A strong performance in the January 2010 tournament saw him win eleven bouts and pick up his fifth Technique Prize. He returned to the komusubi ranking in March, and to sekiwake in May. Dropping to the maegashira ranks for July, he was forced to withdraw after injuring his right knee yet again in a win over Tochinoshin on Day 12. His withdrawal drew much attention in Japan because it meant on that day foreigners outnumbered native born Japanese in the top division for the first time ever (17 to 16). He remained an upper maegashira, and held on to the maegashira 3 rank in July 2011, despite only scoring 7‚Äì8 in the previous tournament, due to the larger number of forced retirements from the top two division in the wake of a match-fixing scandal ‚Äì his brother amongst them. In March 2012 he returned to the rank of sekiwake for the first time in ten tournaments, and although he fell just short of kachi-koshi with a 7‚Äì8 record, he remained in the san'yaku ranks at komusubi in May. On Day 1 he defeated Hakuh≈ç for the fourth time, handing the yokozuna his first opening day defeat since November 2008 ‚Äì and Aminishiki was the wrestler who beat him on that occasion as well. Aminishiki also beat ≈çzeki Baruto, Koto≈çsh≈´ and Kakury≈´ in the opening five days, but was defeated on the final day to fall to a 7‚Äì8 record and missed out on his fifth Outstanding Performance Prize. He returned to komusubi in July 2014 and won his sixth Technique Prize in September, which was his eleventh special prize overall, and first since 2010. Following the retirement of Kyokutenh≈ç in July 2015, Aminishiki had the most appearances in the top division of anyone on the banzuke, and he finished his career fourth on the all-time list. He defeated yokozuna Kakury≈´ on the third day of the January 2016 tournament, his eighth (and final) kinboshi and first since 2009. At 37 years and 3 months he was the fifth oldest wrestler to earn a kinboshi. He defeated every yokozuna he faced at least once. In May 2016 he competed in his 93rd top division tournament, equal fourth on the all-time list, but he tore his left Achilles tendon on the second day and had to withdraw. He missed the Nagoya tournament in July, which meant he dropped to the j≈´ry≈ç division in September for the first time since 2004. He continued to compete despite falling to j≈´ry≈ç, with 8‚Äì7 records in the September and November 2016 tournaments. In May 2017 he had the chance to win his first y≈´sh≈ç or championship in any division at the age of 38 but he was defeated on the last day by Nishikigi. In the September 2017 tournament he was one of four wrestlers to finish with a 10‚Äì5 record and took part in a playoff for the championship, but was eliminated at the semi-final stage. Nevertheless, he was promoted to the top division for the November 2017 tournament, becoming at 39 years of age the oldest man to return to makuuchi since the Japan Sumo Association began keeping records in the 1920s. In this tournament he secured his majority of wins against losses on the final day with a victory over Chiyosh≈çma and was awarded the Fighting Spirit prize, his first sansh≈ç since 2014 and his first Fighting Spirit Award since his debut top division tournament over 17 years previously. He missed three days of the January 2018 tournament with a knee injury, but returned from Day 10. After falling back to j≈´ry≈ç in March he returned to the top division again in May, extending his own record for the oldest wrestler to be promoted to makuuchi. ==Retirement from sumo== On July 16, 2019 Aminishiki announced his retirement at the age of 40 following a knee injury he suffered on the second day of the Nagoya tournament against j≈´ry≈ç newcomer Ryuko, which forced him to withdraw on the third day on and would have seen him demoted to the third makushita division. He is staying in sumo as a toshiyori or elder of the Japan Sumo Association under the name Ajigawa Oyakata. He was the last wrestler born in the 1970s active in sumo's top three professional divisions. His 907 career wins rank him eighth on the all-time list, and only two wrestlers (≈åshio and Kyokutenh≈ç) have fought more than his 1805 career bouts. He announced on his website that his danpatsu- shiki or official retirement ceremony will be held on October 4, 2020. ==Fighting style== Toyonoshima Aminishiki preferred to work on the mawashi rather than push his opponents, and specialized in throwing and tripping techniques. He was one of the few wrestlers in his time to employ soto-gake, or outer leg trip, winning with it 18 times in his career. His most common throw, and third most used move overall, was uwate-nage, or outer arm throw. In September 2018 he defeated maegashira Kotoyuki with the rare tokkurinage, a kind of neck throw (named after the flasks used to serve sake) that had not been seen in the top division since its addition to the list of official techniques in 2001. However, his two most common winning techniques were the straightforward yori-kiri or force out, and oshi-dashi, or push out. His favoured grip on the mawashi at the beginning of his career was the unusual mae-mawashi, a double-handed grip on the front of the belt at the opponent's stomach area. However, he moved to favouring a migi-yotsu grip, with his left hand outside and right hand inside his opponent's arms. Aminishiki was also known for employing henka, or sidestepping, to wrongfoot his opponents at the tachi-ai or initial charge. His victory over Hakuh≈ç in March 2008 was achieved in this manner. In his later years on the dohy≈ç he was restricted by a series of knee injuries and was one of the first wrestlers to wear a carbon fibre knee brace. ==Family== Aminishiki's older brother As≈çfuji was also a sumo wrestler. He made his debut three years before Aminishiki in 1994 but he spent only two tournaments in the top division, retiring in 2011 after having been found guilty of match-fixing. Their stablemaster, former yokozuna Asahifuji, comes from the same area of Japan and is a cousin of their father. Aminishiki is married with three children. His youngest child, and first son, was born in July 2017. ==Career record== ==See also== *List of sumo elders *List of sumo record holders *List of sumo tournament top division runners-up *Glossary of sumo terms *List of past sumo wrestlers *List of sekiwake ==References== ==External links== * *Official website Category:1978 births Category:Living people Category:Japanese sumo wrestlers Category:Sumo people from Aomori Prefecture Category:Sekiwake ","title":"Aminishiki Ry≈´ji"},{"id":"9106065","text":", previously known as Ama K≈çhei, is a retired sumo wrestler. He received his promotion to yokozuna, sumo's highest rank, on September 26, 2012. He is the third Mongolian and fifth overall non-Japanese wrestler to attain yokozuna status. He began his professional career in 2001 and reached the top makuuchi division in 2004. He has won ten special prizes for his achievements in tournaments. In November 2008 he became the seventh foreign-born wrestler in sumo history to reach the second-highest rank of ≈çzeki. In May 2009, he won his first championship, winning the natsu basho (summer tournament). He has won a total of nine top division championships, three of them with a perfect record. At , Harumafuji was the lightest man in the top division as of September 2015. He is noted for his technical skill. Harumafuji admitted to assaulting fellow Mongolian wrestler Takanoiwa during a regional sumo tour in late October 2017. He withdrew from the November 2017 basho shortly after the allegations surfaced. On November 29, 2017, his stablemaster, Isegahama, submitted Harumafuji's letter of resignation to the Japan Sumo Association. ==Early life and sumo background== Byambadorj is a native of Ulan Bator, Mongolia. His father was a Mongolian wrestler, holding a rank roughly equivalent to sumo's sekiwake. He appeared at the Naadam, a Mongolian games festival that includes wrestling, at the age of 15. He was scouted by Ajigawa- oyakata (former yokozuna Asahifuji) in July 2000 and subsequently joined Ajigawa stable (now Isegahama stable). ==Career== He took the fighting name Ama and made his first appearance in January 2001. He reached the top makuuchi division in November 2004, rising slowly to komusubi in May 2006. However, a disappointing 4‚Äì11 result in this tournament sent him back to the maegashira ranks. On the eve of the January 2007 tournament, Ama's father was killed in a traffic accident. Nevertheless, he turned in a strong 10‚Äì5 record there and earned promotion back to komusubi for March. In May 2007, he made his debut at sekiwake rank, becoming the ninth foreign-born rikishi to do so. He held his rank with an 8‚Äì7 record. Ama in May 2007 In September 2007, under the komusubi rank, Ama defeated yokozuna Hakuh≈ç on the opening day and also beat two ≈çzeki. He also memorably defeated newcomer G≈çeid≈ç with a spectacular technique known as okuritsuriotoshi or \\"rear lifting body slam.\\"this technique is illustrated here . He finished with a 10‚Äì5 score and won his first shukun-sh≈ç or Outstanding Performance award. He picked up his second Outstanding Performance award in November with another defeat of Hakuh≈ç, and earned promotion back to sekiwake. In the January 2008 tournament Ama was the only wrestler to defeat Hakuh≈ç, during Hakuh≈ç's successful bid for the tournament championship. This was also his third consecutive defeat of Hakuh≈ç, and this victory helped him to win his third shukun-sh≈ç in a row. However, he failed to score more than nine wins, denting his hopes for ≈çzeki promotion, which normally requires three consecutive double-figure scores. After a poor start to the March 2008 tournament, he had to win his last four matches to barely preserve his rank with an 8‚Äì7 record. On the 8th day at the May 2008 tournament, he amazed audiences by defeating Wakanoh≈ç with a perfectly executed utchari or spin throw on the bales. After the match, Wakanoh≈ç acted violently and was warned. On the 10th day, he also threw yokozuna Hakuh≈ç into the seats with an overarm throw, ending his winning streak. After the tournament Ama was awarded his third Technique prize. ==Promotion to ≈çzeki== In the July 2008 tournament, he achieved a double-figure score for the first time at sekiwake, and won another Technique prize. In the September 2008 tournament Ama finished with twelve wins, recording his second juny≈´sh≈ç (second-place finish, an informal designation), and was awarded his fourth Outstanding Performance award. The November 2008 tournament was the most successful yet for Ama, as he won 13 bouts (including his bout against Hakuh≈ç) and his thirty-five victories over the last three tournaments exceeded the thirty three generally required for ≈çzeki promotion. He reached a play-off against Hakuh≈ç as a result and lost the play-off, still, his promotion was now inevitable. He was awarded his fifth Technique prize and achieved another juny≈´sh≈ç. On November 26, 2008, Ama was promoted to ≈çzeki by the Sum≈ç Association, and on the occasion had his fighting name or shikona changed to Harumafuji. The name was chosen by his stablemaster, former yokozuna Asahifuji. ==≈åzeki career== Harumafuji's debut tournament as an ≈çzeki in January 2009 was inauspicious. Debuting a new name and a new, silver-colored mawashi, he lost his first four matches. On the fifth day he returned to the ring in his customary black mawashi, rallied, and by the end of the tournament secured an 8‚Äì7 majority of wins. He did better in the following tournament in March, defeating Asash≈çry≈´ and winning ten bouts. In May he went undefeated in his first twelve matches until he was beaten by Hakuh≈ç on Day 13 with a rare leg sweep, susoharai. Harumafuji recovered to defeat Asash≈çry≈´ the next day with an outer leg trip, sotogake. With Hakuh≈ç falling to Koto≈çsh≈´ on the same day, both men went into Day 15 with identical 13‚Äì1 records. Harumafuji defeated Koto≈çsh≈´ for a career-best 14‚Äì1 record while Hakuh≈ç was victorious over Asash≈çry≈´, setting up a playoff. Harumafuji defeated Hakuh≈ç with an under-arm throw, shitatenage, to win his first top division championship. He became the third Mongolian to win the Emperor's Cup, and the eighth foreigner overall. Harumafuji's mother was in the audience to see him awarded the trophy by Japanese Prime Minister Tar≈ç As≈ç. However, in the following July basho he recorded only a disappointing 9‚Äì6. He pulled out of the November 2010 tournament on Day 4 having injured his right ankle in a defeat to Tochinoshin. In July 2011, Harumafuji won his second championship, defeating Hakuh≈ç on the 14th day to win his fourteenth straight match and establish an unassailable two win lead over his rival. This stopped Hakuh≈ç's streak of consecutive y≈´sh≈ç at seven. It was also the first time since his first y≈´sh≈ç that he had won more than ten bouts in a tournament. Harumafuji commented after his victory, \\"I really wrestled the sumo of my life. I've had many troubles and injuries since becoming ≈çzeki but I kept training and got support from a lot of people.\\" He lost his final day match to Kisenosato to finish on 14‚Äì1. However, any chance of immediate promotion to yokozuna ended when he scored only 8‚Äì7 in the following tournament. ==Promotion to yokozuna== In a May 2012 tournament, Harumafuji finished with a nearly even record of 8‚Äì7. In his final match, he defeated Hakuh≈ç for his 8th win of the tournament, beginning a winning streak. He bounced back in July as he won his third championship without losing a bout, beating Hakuh≈ç on the last day for his first zensh≈ç-y≈´sh≈ç (winning every match in that tournament). Harumafuji got his chance to earn promotion to yokozuna for the third time in his career. In a September tournament, Harumafuji defeated Hakuh≈ç once again to win his fourth championship and another consecutive zensh≈ç-y≈´sh≈ç. Having won two successive tournaments, Harumafuji met the criteria for promotion to yokozuna. Following this performance, he was formally promoted to be the 70th yokozuna on September 26, 2012. This promotion made him the third consecutive Mongolian-born wrestler, following Asash≈çry≈´ and Hakuh≈ç, to achieve this rank. He attended a ceremony bestowing him the title, and said \\"With the awareness of what it means to be a yokozuna, I will devote my body and soul to the way of sumo.\\" He performed his first yokozuna dohy≈ç-iri (ring-entering ceremony) on September 28, 2012, in front of 3,000 people at the Meiji Shrine in Tokyo, with Aminishiki as the sword carrier and Takarafuji as the dew sweeper. After the two-minute ceremony was over he said \\"I aimed to carry out a beautiful dohyoiri\\". His stablemaster had coached him the previous day on how to do the ring-entering ceremony in the Shiranui-style, the style used by himself as an active yokozuna. ==Yokozuna career== Harumafuji's first tournament as a yokozuna in November 2012 was a disappointing one, as he gave up a kinboshi to Okinoumi on just the second day, and from 9‚Äì1 up finished with a 9‚Äì6 record. He became the first new yokozuna ever to lose his last five matches. Despite being criticized heavily for his lackluster debut at the rank of yokozuna, Harumafuji bounced back with a tremendous showing in the following tournament winning all 15 matches, for his third zensh≈ç-y≈´sh≈ç. He struggled again in March, giving up kinboshi to Takayasu, Chiyotairy≈´ and Toyonoshima and also losing his last three matches. He did slightly better in the May tournament, scoring 11‚Äì4, but was never in contention for the championship. In the November tournament of 2013, he won his second championship as a yokozuna with a 14‚Äì1 record, decided by a final-day victory over Hakuh≈ç. Harumafuji was not able to build on this success as he had to sit out the January 2014 tournament due to injury, and subsequently was not in contention for the championship on the final day of any tournament in 2014. Excluding the March tournament where he won his first 11 matches before losing three in a row, he was not a serious contender at all in any of the tournaments' second weeks, having dropped at least two matches before the midway point in three of them, and withdrawing from the September tournament due to an eye injury during the first week. Thus 2014 was his first year without a championship since 2010. Harumafuji was a runner-up in the opening tournament of January 2015 with an 11‚Äì4 record, his second runner-up performance as a yokozuna and first since March 2014. He withdrew from the July 2015 tournament in Nagoya on just the second day after injuring his right elbow, and the injury also kept him out of the following tournament in September. This means his title drought had extended to two years by the time he made his comeback at the November 2015 tournament in Kyushu. He was defeated on the second day by ≈åsuna-arashi, but won his next twelve bouts, including victories over his fellow yokozuna Hakuh≈ç and Kakury≈´, to enter the final day with a one match lead over Hakuh≈ç and the maegashira 10 Sh≈çh≈çzan. He lost to Kisenosato to end the tournament at 13‚Äì2 but claimed the championship when Hakuh≈ç was beaten by Kakury≈´ in the final match. Harumafuji commented \\"I wanted to win the championship with a victory but I am happy I could respond to expectations of the fans\\". In January 2016 Harumafuji defeated Hakuh≈ç on the final day to end with a 12‚Äì3 record which placed him in a tie for second behind the upset winner Kotosh≈çgiku. In March he posted a moderate 9‚Äì6 in a tournament which saw him struggling with a knee injury in addition to his chronic ankle problems. After a solid but unremarkable 10‚Äì5 in May he returned to his best at Nagoya in July. Despite giving up kinboshi to Okinoumi on day 3 and Yoshikaze on day 9 he won his last six matches to win his eighth top-division championship. He defeated his main challenger, Kisenosato, on day 13 and avoided a play-off by beating Hakuh≈ç by yorikiri in the last match of the tournament. After winning the Nagoya tournament for the third time he said \\"I‚Äôve been fortunate here. I love the people of Nagoya. The accumulated effort of each and every day got me to today. I focused on giving everything I had and leaving with no regrets. I‚Äôve been dealing with a lot of injuries lately, but I was able to win because of my stablemaster‚Äôs help and the support of sumo-loving fans. I felt like I could really put everything on the line in every bout, every day.\\" In the September tournament he was in contention for the title until losing to G≈çeid≈ç on the thirteenth day and ended in third place with a 12‚Äì3 record. Harumafuji was and Kisenosato were neck in and neck coming into the November 2016 for most victories in a calendar year since Hakuh≈ç sat out all of the September tournament. However Kisenosato prevailed getting the honor having gotten 69 wins, Harumafuji had 67 wins, and Hakuh≈ç had 62 wins. In the January 2017 tournament, Harumafuji gave away two kinboshi on Days 2 and 3, to Mitakeumi and Sh≈çh≈çzan respectively. With those losses Harumafuji has given away 32 kinboshi. Harumafuji won the next three days, but then pulled out on Day 7, citing an injury. In May 2017 he was the co-leader with Hakuh≈ç remaining unbeaten until Day 11 when he lost to Mitakeumi. He finished on 11‚Äì4. In this tournament he moved into the all-time top ten for top division victories, with 690. Harumafuji was the only other yokozuna apart from Hakuh≈ç to complete the July 2017 tournament, where he scored 11‚Äì4 again. His stablemaster indicated that he may need to undergo surgery on a persistent injury to his elbow, but Harumafuji later decided not to have the surgery. He was the sole yokozuna to enter the September 2017 tournament after Hakuh≈ç, Kakury≈´ and Kisenosato all withdrew through injury. He was defeated by maegashira Kotosh≈çgiku on Day 3 after he apparently stopped fighting after the initial charge, expecting the bout to be called as matta. He was criticized by the head of the Japan Sumo Association, Hakkaku, for giving up. However, he rallied after standing at 2‚Äì3 on Day 5 to win nine of his ten remaining bouts, including tournament leader G≈çeid≈ç on Day 15 to force a playoff with both men tied on identical 11‚Äì4 records. Harumafuji won the playoff to take his ninth career y≈´sh≈ç. His 11‚Äì4 record was the lowest to win a top division championship since 1996. ===Assault and subsequent retirement=== After Harumafuji lost his first two bouts of the November 2017 Tournament, Japanese newspaper Sports Nippon reported that Harumafuji assaulted fellow Mongolian wrestler Takanoiwa during a regional sumo tour in Tottori in late October. According to the report and other sources, Harumafuji was drinking with other sumo wrestlers, who included Hakuh≈ç, Kakury≈´ and Terunofuji as well as Japanese wrestlers, and was admonishing Takanoiwa over his behavior. Angered that Takanoiwa was looking at his cell phone at the time, Harumafuji struck him in the head with a beer bottle and punched him 20 to 30 times. Takanoiwa's head injury, which included a skull fracture, forced him to miss the entire November 2017 Tournament, which subsequently resulted in his demotion from maegashira #8 to j≈´ry≈ç #3. Harumafuji's stablemaster, Isegahama, admitted the incident to officials with the Japan Sumo Association. Harumafuji told the press that he sincerely apologized for causing trouble. He withdrew from the rest of the November 2017 Tournament, citing a left elbow injury. The Japan Sumo Association announced that they would investigate the incident, but any ruling or punishment would not be announced until the conclusion of the tournament. After Harumafuji flew back from Fukuoka to Tokyo, he was questioned by Tottori police as part of their own investigation. He was then questioned by the Sumo Association's crisis management panel, where he admitted to assaulting Takanoiwa. Tottori police were set to refer the incident to prosecutors by the end of the year. Mongolian yokozuna Hakuh≈ç, who was present at the incident, told the press before Day 5 of the tournament that he owed a \\"deep apology to the sumo world and the public.\\" Contrary to media reports, Hakuh≈ç insisted Harumafuji was holding a beer bottle, but it slipped out of his hands. Hakuh≈ç claimed that he broke up the fight and took Harumafuji out of the room. Conflicting reports over subsequent days suggested an ice pick, ashtray, microphone or karaoke remote control may have been used instead, while Harumafuji himself said he used only his bare hands. The day after the November 2017 Tournament ended, the Yokozuna Deliberation Council (YDC) convened at the Ry≈çgoku Kokugikan in Tokyo and agreed that an \\"extremely harsh punishment\\" be administered to Harumafuji. The YDC did not take any formal action, saying they would wait until the investigation by the crisis management panel has been completed. On November 29, 2017, Isegahama said that Harumafuji had decided to retire. He submitted Harumafuji's letter of resignation to the Japan Sumo Association, and Harumafuji held a press conference later that day in which he said, \\"as yokozuna I feel responsible for injuring Takanoiwa and so will retire from today.\\" He did not go into details about the incident but added, \\"I had heard that he was lacking in manners and civility and thought it was my duty as a senior wrestler to correct and teach him. But I went too far.\\" He also denied that he had been drinking to excess. On December 11 the Tottori police concluded their investigation and turned the case over to prosecutors. On December 20, 2017, the YDC said that they would have recommended Harumafuji's resignation had he not already retired, and that there needed to be a clear standard set for future cases. The chairman of the YDC said \\"Harumafuji, a yokozuna who should be a role model to all wrestlers, showed abusive behavior that led to injury. A yokozuna must bear this heavy responsibility.\\" Tottori prosecutors officially indicted Harumafuji on December 28, 2017 in Summary Court. Prosecutors felt that the public backlash over the incident, combined with Takanoiwa's desire to see Harumafuji punished, warranted a filing in Summary Court, rather than a higher court where there would have been a full trial with lawyer examinations. On January 3, 2018 Harumafuji was fined 500,000 yen (US$ 4,400). On October 4, 2018 Takanoiwa filed a lawsuit in Tokyo District Court seeking 24 million yen in damages from Harumafuji, after negotiations over an informal settlement broke down. Takanoiwa later dropped the suit, citing harassment his family was receiving back home in Mongolia. Since his retirement, Harumafuji has been working in an unofficial capacity as a coach at Isegahama stable. His danpatsu-shiki, or official retirement ceremony, was held on September 30, 2018 at the Ry≈çgoku Kokugikan. He has also opened a school in Mongolia, with Japanese style education. His memoir, Body and Soul, was released in January 2019. ===Rivalry with Hakuh≈ç=== His career record against Hakuh≈ç was 21 wins against 36 losses (22 wins against 37 losses if playoffs for the championship are included). He has more wins over Hakuh≈ç than any other wrestler. Harumafuji vs Hakuh≈ç was the final match of the tournament for ten consecutive tournaments from May 2012 until November 2013, the second longest streak after the 15 straight contested by Wajima and Kitanoumi. Harumafuji and Hakuh≈ç's 24 final matches of a tournament in total is second only to the 27 contested by Akebono and Takanohana. Hakuh≈ç was criticized by the Yokozuna Deliberation Council for expressing his hope that Harumafuji would return to sumo after his November 2017 tournament victory, and leading the crowd in banzai cheers. ==Fighting style== Harumafuji was a relative lightweight known for his speed, particularly at the tachi-ai, or initial charge. He was regarded as a technician, like many other Mongolian sumo wrestlers, specialising in throws and lifts. He used 42 different winning kimarite in his career. He was adept at both uwatenage (overarm throw) and shitatenage (underarm throw) as well as uwatedashinage (pulling overarm throw). He was also skilled at tsuki or thrusting techniques, and his second most common winning move after yorikiri was oshidashi, or push out. He sometimes used harite, or slaps to the face, a technique that was criticized by a member of the Yokozuna Deliberation Council. Weighing in at 133 kg in November 2012, Harumafuji became the first yokozuna since Chiyonofuji in 1982 to also be the lightest man in the top division. ==Personal life== Harumafuji married M. Battuul in Japan on October 10, 2011. The wedding ceremony was held according to sumo traditions, and the bride wore Japanese ceremonial clothes. Harumafuji and Battuul met in 2009, when Battuul graduated from Iwate University in northern Japan. They were engaged in September 2010. The wedding ceremony had been postponed due to upheavals in the sumo world over the match- fixing scandal. Their first daughter was born in December 2010.Famed Mongolian sumo wrestler gets married October 12, 2011 Their second daughter was born in May 2012. In June 2013 he revealed that in 2010, he had acquired the qualification to be a policeman in Mongolia through distance education, and that he had plans to go to Mongolia to publish his graduation thesis, which was about the differences between Mongolian and Japanese law. In 2014 he attended classes at the graduate school of Hosei University, studying the Mongolian economy and education system. He is a keen painter and in September 2018 around 20 of his paintings were exhibited in a gallery in Ginza to mark the opening of his school. ==Career record== ==See also== *List of yokozuna *List of sumo tournament top division champions *List of sumo tournament top division runners-up *List of sumo tournament second division champions *Glossary of sumo terms *List of past sumo wrestlers *List of non-Japanese sumo wrestlers ==References== ==External links== * *complete biography and basho results (Japanese) Category:1984 births Category:Living people Category:Mongolian expatriates in Japan Category:Mongolian sumo wrestlers Category:Yokozuna Category:Sportspeople from Ulaanbaatar ","title":"Harumafuji K≈çhei"},{"id":"9106083","text":"A Barani (barani) flip is an aerial maneuver consisting of a front flip and a 180 degree turn (half twist). This trick is performed in number of sports including but not limited to dancing, gymnastics, cheerleading, trampoline, cliff diving, aggressive inline skating, and freerunning. A barani is an aerial somersault flip, used as a trick for flyers, dancers, high divers and snowboarders. It is used as an official move in gymnastics, tumbling, and freerunning. The 180 degree turn is carried out usually halfway through the frontflip. The reason why it is used in so many sports is that it converts a regular frontflip (during which one can not see the ground or water for the landing) into a move in which one turns in time so that the last half of the flip is done in the same way as a backflip (during which one can see the ground or water). It therefore allows for greater control of the landing. In gymnastics, some coaches describe a Barani as a roundoff without hands or, mostly on beam, a front somersault with a half twist. It is named after Italian circus acrobat and tumbler Alfonso Baroni, who performed the trick around 1881.Wight Flyers Trampoline Club ==Similar tricks== *Misty Flip (snowboarding) *McTwist (skateboarding / snowboarding) *Roundoff (gymnastics) ==References== More professional info about the twisting direction Category:Aggressive skating Category:Roller skating elements Category:Trampolining Category:Gymnastics manoeuvres ","title":"Barani flip"},{"id":"9106096","text":"As≈çfuji Seiya (born January 17, 1976 as Kiyotoshi Suginomori) is a retired sumo wrestler from Fukaura, Nishitsugaru, Aomori, Japan. His highest rank was maegashira 13. He is the elder brother of Aminishiki. ==Career== As≈çfuji made his professional debut in January 1994. He joined Ajigawa stable, run by former yokozuna Asahifuji, who was also of Nishitsugaru District and a cousin of As≈çfuji's father. He took a long time to climb up the rankings, mainly due to his relatively light weight (barely 100 kg). He was even outperformed by his younger brother, who, though he joined the stable three years after As≈çfuji, had already reached sekitori status by 2000. As≈çfuji first reached the second highest j≈´ry≈ç division in September 2003, but lasted only one tournament before being demoted back to the third makushita division. He reappeared in the second division a year later and in November 2006 he finally made his top makuuchi division debut at the age of 30. He was the ninth oldest makuuchi debutant since the end of World War II. In that tournament, there were three sets of brothers (Asofuji and Aminishiki, Kitazakura and Toyozakura, and Roh≈ç and Hakurozan) in the top division simultaneously for the first and only time in sumo history. As≈çfuji could manage only a 6-9 score in his top division debut, and only four wins in the next tournament in January 2007. He fell back to the j≈´ry≈ç division for the March 2007 tournament and a 4-11 record in July sent him right to the bottom of the division. He held onto sekitori status with an 8-7 mark in September but could manage only five wins in January 2008 and fell back to makushita. He managed a 5-2 score in the March 2008 tournament which returned him immediately to the second division, but again he was unable to secure kachi-koshi (more wins than losses) and was demoted to makushita once more. He scored 5-2 again in July for another immediate return to j≈´ry≈ç for the September tournament, but fell back to the third division yet again, narrowly missing the kachi-koshi with a 7-8 score. However, a fine 6-1 score at the top makushita ranking in November 2008 ensured his return to the sekitori ranks once again. This was his sixth promotion to j≈´ry≈ç, putting him in equal third place on the all-time list. He remained in the j≈´ry≈ç division for the rest of his career, although he never won more than nine bouts in a tournament. ==Retirement from sumo== As≈çfuji was one of 23 wrestlers found guilty of fixing the result of bouts after an investigation by the Japan Sumo Association, and ordered to retire in April 2011. He considered filing a lawsuit against his dismissal, but chose to hand in his retirement papers on April 4. His danpatsu-shiki or official retirement ceremony was held at the Ry≈çgoku Kokugikan on May 29, 2011. After reportedly considering a career in mixed martial arts, he was hired privately by Isegahama stable as a trainer. ==Fighting style== As≈çfuji had a weight disadvantage against most of his competitors in the sekitori ranks, and had to rely on his technical skill. Among his favourite techniques were nage, or throws. His most common winning move over the six tournaments from July 2007 to May 2008 was uwatedashinage, or \\"pulling outer-arm throw\\", but he was also adept at shitatenage, or inner-arm throws. ==Family== As≈çfuji was married in December 2006. ==Career record== ==See also== *Glossary of sumo terms *List of past sumo wrestlers ==References== ==External links== * Category:1976 births Category:Living people Category:Japanese sumo wrestlers Category:Sumo people from Aomori Prefecture ","title":"As≈çfuji Seiya"},{"id":"9106115","text":"Aquinas College is one of the Residential Colleges of the University of Otago, named after St. Thomas Aquinas, located in the suburb of Dalmore.

He became famous in the post-war period, eventually rising to become undisputed world champion and a hero to many people in his home city. ==Boxing career== Born in Lancaster Street in north Belfast. Monaghan attended St Patrick's Christian Brothers' School in Donegall St. A noted fighter at boys' level, he entered the paid ranks in his mid-teens. After a short period of wartime service, Monaghan resumed his career and his burgeoning reputation drew huge crowds from all parts of his home city. In particular, bouts at Belfast's King's Hall were the highlight with that venue normally packed to the rafters. In October 1947, the National Boxing Association world crown became his after outpointing the American, Dado Marino at Harringay Stadium for the vacant title. The mantle of undisputed champion of the world rested on his shoulders after his defeat of the tough Scottish fighter Jackie Paterson on 23 March 1948. Paterson was to prove one of the Belfast man's major adversaries. By the time that a long-standing chest complaint forced his retirement as champion in 1950, Monaghan's trophy-cabinet contained the British, European, Commonwealth and World crowns. Of the 66 official bouts he fought during his illustrious career, he won 51, drew 6 and lost 9. Monaghan endeared himself to his supporters after his fights by singing When Irish Eyes are Smiling to the King's Hall audience, which joined in the singing. ==Life outside boxing== A part-time cabaret artist, Monaghan toured western Europe during World War II with other notables of the period including Vera Lynn, Gracie Fields and George Formby, and later formed his own band.\\"Boxing legend's life story\\" Irish News (Belfast newspaper), October 8, 2008, p. 3 His nickname \\"Rinty\\" came from his fondness for dogs.

He died at his home in Little Corporation St in March 1984, at the relatively young age of 65. He was buried in Belfast City Cemetery. To mark the influence of this \\"home-town hero\\", the Ulster History Circle and Belfast City Council provided a plaque in his honour at the King's Hall that was unveiled, in the presence of many of his family circle and friends, on 3 May 2007.

It is native to northeastern and north-central North America. It is an invasive plant in other parts of the continent and several areas worldwide, including Europe and Asia.Altervista Flora Italiana, Verga d'oro del Canad√†, Solidago canadensis L. photos, European distribution mapAtlas of Living Australia It is often grown as an ornamental in flower gardens. The plant is erect, often forming colonies. Flowers are small yellow heads held above the foliage on a branching inflorescence. ==Ecology and distribution== Solidago canadensis is sometimes browsed by deer and is good to fair as food for domestic livestock such as cattle or horses. It is found in a variety of habitats. It typically is one of the first plants to colonize an area after disturbance (such as fire) and rarely persists once shrubs and trees become established. It is found in very dry locations and also waterlogged ones. Although utilized by a variety of insects to some degree for its floral rewards, it is especially strongly favored as a nectar source by paper wasps, such as Polistes parametricus and Polistes fuscatus. Aside from wasps, it is also fairly popular with honeybees and bumblebees. It is generally passed over by monarchs and other larger-sized butterflies, in favor of other flowers. It can be extremely aggressive and tends to form monocultures and near-monocultures in parts of its native range, such as in Southwest Ohio clay loam. It often outcompetes competitive species in such habitat. It not only seeds a great deal but also spreads rapidly via running rhizomes. Its root system is very tough and plants that have been pulled out of the ground prior to freezing and left exposed atop soil have survived -14 Fahrenheit (-26C) winter temperatures. ==Invasive species== In many parts of Europe, Japan and China, it is established as an invasive weed. In eastern and southeastern China, particularly the provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Jiangxi and Shanghai, its invasion has caused widespread concern. It has been reported that the spread of invasive plants including Canada goldenrod has caused the extinction of 30 native plants in Shanghai.Jiangsu's battle with Canada Goldenrod (Chinese) In the city of Ningbo, Zhejiang, it has reduced local orange harvests.Jiaodianfangtan (Chinese) It is still spreading across China, and sightings have been reported in as far as Yunnan province. ==Medicinal uses== The stems and leaves of goldenrod have been dried and used in folk medicine. Its main use has been on the skin to treat wounds and as a diuretic. It has been used to get rid of kidney stones and other kidney ailments by flushing them out. Other uses have included as a mouth rinse and gargle, and treatment for inflammation, tuberculosis, allergies, gout, hemorrhoids, arthritis, asthma, internal bleeding.

The island is the site where the capital Conakry was built on. It is the site of the old city of Conakry while the new colonial city is located at Kaloum. It is linked to the peninsula by a causeway. The island was placed under a French protectorate by the king of Dubr√©ka on 20 January 1880. This step was aimed to counter the English influence growing in the region. On 24 December 1885, the Germans renounced to be established on the Island of Tombo and obtain a territory at the border between Togo and Dahomey. The island became a French territory after its acquisition on 8 June 1889. ==See also== * Islands of Africa ==References== * Category:Conakry Category:Extinct volcanoes Category:Islands of Guinea Category:Landforms of Guinea Category:Volcanic islands Category:Volcanoes of Africa Category:Islands of the North Atlantic Ocean ","title":"Tombo Island"},{"id":"9106229","text":"Ion RoatƒÉ (; also known as Ioan RoatƒÉ or Mo»ô Ion RoatƒÉ; 1806 in C√¢mpuri, Vrancea County ‚Äì 20 February 1882 in Gura VƒÉii) was a Moldavian, later Romanian peasant and political figure.

As owner of the Daily Mail and the Daily Mirror, he was an early developer of popular journalism, and he exercised vast influence over British popular opinion during the Edwardian era. Lord Beaverbrook said he was \\"the greatest figure who ever strode down Fleet Street.\\"Lord Beaverbrook, Politicians and the War, 1914‚Äì1916 (1928) 1:93. About the beginning of the 20th century there were increasing attempts to develop popular journalism intended for the working class and tending to emphasize sensational topics. Harmsworth was the main innovator. Northcliffe had a powerful role during the First World War, especially by criticizing the government regarding the Shell Crisis of 1915. He directed a mission to the new ally, the United States, during 1917, and was director of enemy propaganda during 1918. His Amalgamated Press employed writers such as Arthur Mee and John Hammerton, and its subsidiary, the Educational Book Company, published The Harmsworth Self-Educator, The Children's Encyclop√¶dia, and Harmsworth's Universal Encyclopaedia. ==BiographyEarly life and success=== Born in Chapelizod, County Dublin, the son of Alfred and Geraldine Harmsworth, he was educated at Stamford School in Lincolnshire, England, from 1876 and at Henley House School in Kilburn, London from 1878. A master at Henley House who was to prove important to his future was J. V. Milne, the father of A. A. Milne, who according to H. G. Wells was at school with him at the time and encouraged him to start the school magazine.H. G. Wells, An Experiment in Autobiography, Chapter 6 In 1880 he first visited the Sylvan Debating Club, founded by his father, and of which he later served as Treasurer. Beginning as a freelance journalist, he initiated his first newspaper, Answers (original title: Answers to Correspondents), and was later assisted by his brother Harold, who was adept in business matters. Harmsworth had an intuitive sense for what the reading public wanted to buy, and began a series of cheap but successful periodicals, such as Comic Cuts (tagline: \\"Amusing without being Vulgar\\") and the journal Forget-Me-Not for women. From these periodicals, he developed the largest periodical publishing company in the world, Amalgamated Press. Boyce (2004). His half-penny periodicals published in the 1890s played a role in the decline of the Victorian penny dreadfuls. Harmsworth was an early developer of popular journalism. He bought several failing newspapers and made them into an enormously profitable news group, primarily by appealing to the general public. He began with The Evening News during 1894, and then merged two Edinburgh papers to form the Edinburgh Daily Record. That same year he funded an expedition to Franz Joseph Land in the Arctic with the intention of making attempts to travel to the North Pole. Brice, Arthur Montefiore, and H. Fisher. \\"The Jackson-Harmsworth Polar Expedition, Notes of the Last Year's Work.\\" The Geographical Journal 8.6 (1896): 543‚Äì564. online On 4 May 1896 he began publishing the Daily Mail in London, which was a success, having the world record for daily circulation until Harmsworth's death; taglines of the Daily Mail included \\"the busy man's daily journal\\" and \\"the penny newspaper for one halfpenny\\". Prime Minister Robert Cecil, Lord Salisbury, said it was \\"written by office boys for office boys\\".Oxford Dictionary of Quotations, 1975 Harmsworth then transformed a Sunday newspaper, the Weekly Dispatch, into the Sunday Dispatch, then the greatest circulation Sunday newspaper in Britain. He also initiated the Harmsworth Magazine (later London Magazine 1898‚Äì1915), utilizing one of Britain's best editors, Beckles Willson, who had been editor of many successful publications, including The Graphic. During 1899 Harmsworth was responsible for the unprecedented success of a charitable appeal for the dependents of soldiers fighting in the South African War by inviting Rudyard Kipling and Arthur Sullivan to write the song \\"The Absent-Minded Beggar\\".Cannon, John. \\"The Absent-Minded Beggar\\", Gilbert and Sullivan News, March 1987, Vol. 11, No. 8, pp. 16‚Äì17, The Gilbert and Sullivan Society, London. Harmsworth also initiated The Daily Mirror during 1903, and rescued the financially desperate Observer and The Times during 1905 and 1908, respectively. During 1908, he also acquired The Sunday Times. The Amalgamated Press subsidiary the Educational Book Company published the Harmsworth Self- Educator, The Children's Encyclop√¶dia, and Harmsworth's Universal Encyclopaedia. Boyce (2004). He brought his younger brothers into his media empire, and they all flourished: Harold Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Rothermere, Cecil Harmsworth, 1st Baron Harmsworth, Sir Leicester Harmsworth, 1st Baronet and Sir Hildebrand Harmsworth, 1st Baronet. ===Ennobled=== Harmsworth was created a Baronet, of Elmwood, in the parish of St Peters in the County of Kent during 1904. During 1905, Harmsworth was raised to the peerage as Baron Northcliffe, of the Isle of Thanet in the County of Kent, and during 1918 was created Viscount Northcliffe, of St Peter's in the County of Kent, for his service as the director of the British war mission in the United States. ==Marriage== Alfred Harmsworth married Mary Elizabeth Milner on 11 April 1888. She was appointed Dame Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire (GBE) and Dame of Grace, Order of St John (D.St.J) during 1918. They did not have any children. ===Children=== Lord Northcliffe had four acknowledged children by two different women. The first, Alfred Benjamin Smith, was born when Harmsworth was seventeen years old; the mother was a sixteen-year-old maidservant in his parents' home.Taylor The Great Outsiders pp.10‚Äì11 Smith died during 1930, allegedly in a mental home.Taylor The Great Outsiders p. 222 By 1900, Harmsworth had acquired a new mistress, an Irishwoman named Kathleen Wrohan, about whom little is known but her name; she bore him two further sons and a daughter, and died during 1923.Taylor The Great Outsiders pp. 47‚Äì48 and p. 222. ==Political influence== By 1914 Northcliffe controlled 40% of the morning newspaper circulation, 45% of the evening and 15% of the Sunday circulation in Britain.Tompson, \\"Fleet Street Colossus\\" p. 115. June, 1917 Northcliffe's ownership of The Times, the Daily Mail and other newspapers meant that his editorials influenced both \\"the classes and the masses\\". That meant that in an era before radio, television or internet, Northcliffe dominated the British press \\"as it never has been before or since by one man\\". Northcliffe's editorship of the Daily Mail in the years just before the First World War in which the newspaper displayed \\"a virulent anti-German sentiment\\" caused The Star to declare, \\"Next to the Kaiser, Lord Northcliffe has done more than any living man to bring about the war\\". His newspapers, especially The Times, reported the Shell Crisis of 1915 with such zeal that it helped to end the Liberal government of Prime Minister H. H. Asquith, which forced Asquith to form a coalition government (the other causal event was the resignation of Admiral Fisher as First Sea Lord). Northcliffe's newspapers propagandized for creating a Minister of Munitions, which was held first by David Lloyd George, and helped to bring about Lloyd George's appointment as prime minister in 1916. Lloyd George offered Northcliffe a job in his cabinet, but Northcliffe refused and was instead appointed director for propaganda. Boyce (2004). Such was Northcliffe's influence on anti-German propaganda during the World War I that a German warship was sent to shell his house, Elmwood, in Broadstairs, in an attempt to assassinate him. His former residence still bears a shell hole out of respect for his gardener's wife, who was killed in the attack. On 6 April 1919, Lloyd George made an excoriating attack on Harmsworth, terming his arrogance \\"diseased vanity\\". By then, Harmsworth's influence was decreasing. Northcliffe's enemies accused him of power without responsibility, but his papers were a factor in settling the Anglo-Irish Treaty in 1921, and his mission to the United States in 1917 has been judged successful by historians.John Cannon, ed., The Oxford Companion to British History (2002) p. 454. Northcliffe's personality shaped his career. He was monolingual and not well-educated and knew little history or science. He had a lust for power and for money, while leaving the accounting paperwork to his brother Harold. He imagined himself Napoleon reborn and resembled the emperor physically and in terms of his enormous energy and ambition. Above all, he had a boyish enthusiasm for everything. Norman Fyfe, an intimate friend, described him: > Boyish in his power of concentration upon the matter of the moment, boyish > in his readiness to turn swiftly to a different matter and concentrate on > that.... Boyish the limited range of his intellect, which seldom concerns > itself with anything but the immediate, the obvious, the popular. Boyish his > irresponsibility, his disinclination to take himself or his publications > seriously; his conviction that whatever benefits them is justifiable, and > that it is not his business to consider the effect of their contents on the > public mind.Hamilton Fyfe, Northcliffe an Intimate Biography (1930) p. 106. ==Sport== In 1903 Harmsworth initiated the Harmsworth Cup, the first international award for motorboat racing. ===Motoring=== Harmsworth was a friend of Claude Johnson, chief executive of Rolls-Royce Limited, and during the years preceding the First World war became an enthusiast of the Rolls- Royce Silver Ghost car. ==Death== Lord Northcliffe circa 1921 driving a Fordson tractor at Henry Ford's farm near Dearborn, Michigan. Northcliffe was on a world tour at the time, trying to recover his health, but he died in 1922. He had been closely involved in the purchase of Fordson tractors by the British government during the First World War. Monument to Northcliffe at St Dunstan-in-the-West Lord Northcliffe's health declined during 1921 due mainly to a streptococcal infection. His mental health collapsed; he acted like a madman but historians say it was a physical malady.Brendon (2003) pp 53‚Äì62. He went on a world tour to revive himself, but it failed to do so. He died of endocarditis in his London house, No. 1 Carlton House Gardens, on 14 August, 1922. Retrieved 23 November 2013. He left three months' pay to each of his six thousand employees. The viscountcy, barony, and baronetcy of Northcliffe became extinct. A monument to Northcliffe at St Dunstan-in-the-West, Fleet Street, London, was unveiled in 1930. The obelisk was designed by Edwin Lutyens and the bronze bust is by Kathleen Scott. His body was buried at East Finchley Cemetery in North London. ==Legacy== Historian Ian Christopher Fletcher states: A. J. P. Taylor, however, says, \\"Northcliffe could destroy when he used the news properly. He could not step into the vacant place. He aspired to power instead of influence, and as a result forfeited both.\\"A.J.P. Taylor, English History 1914-1945 (1965) p 27. P. P. Catterall and Colin Seymour-Ure conclude that: The A. Harmsworth Glacier in North Greenland was named by Robert Peary in his honour. Harmsworth had gifted Peary expedition ship \\"Windward\\" following a lecture on Polar exploration he gave at the Royal Geographical Society in 1897.Daniel E. Harmon, Robert Peary. 2013 ===Promotion of Group Settlement Scheme=== Through his newspaper career, Northcliffe promoted the ideas which resulted in the Group Settlement Scheme. The scheme promised land in Western Australia to British settlers prepared to emigrate and develop the land. A town founded specifically to assist the new settlements was named Northcliffe, in recognition of Lord Northcliffe's promotion of the scheme. Northcliffe lived for a time at 31 Pandora Road, West Hampstead ‚Äì this site is now marked with an English Heritage blue plaque. ==See also== * Daily Mail aviation prizes ==References== ==Further reading== * Bingham, Adrian. \\"The Daily Mail and the First World War\\" History Today (Dec 2013) 63#12 pp 1-8. * Boyce, D.

This belief, supported by the concept that God's will controls everything and that no event should be considered truly impossible, is used by local communities to deal with occasional cases of pregnancy in women with absentee husbands, a frequent situation in the modern era due to the large number of males working as immigrant labor in Europe. This folk belief is used to dismiss an accusation of adultery and the consequences that such an accusation would bring. This belief was acknowledged by traditional Islamic legislation in Morocco, and is still given as an explanation by some divorced or separated women expecting their ex-husbands to acknowledge the paternity of a child born up to twelve months after the separation. Article 154 of the current Mudawana in Moroccan law stipulates that a child born up to one year after the separation is considered as fathered by the ex-husband. The storyline of L'Enfant endormi (2005), a Belgo- Moroccan movie by Yasmine Kassari, is built around this theme. ==See also== * Mudawana, the personal status and family code in Moroccan law ==References== * Jo√´l Colin, L'enfant endormi dans le ventre de sa m√®re, Etude √©thnologique et juridique d'une croyance au Maghreb, Presses universitaires de Perpignan, 1998. * Sleeping children: the view of a traditional Moroccan midwife Category:Superstitions of Africa Category:Moroccan culture Category:Human pregnancy ","title":"Sleeping child"},{"id":"9106281","text":"Spizzico is a chain of franchised quick-service pizzerias owned by the Italian-based multinational catering company Autogrill.

The model debuted in 2001, and since 2011 it has been in its third generation. It was launched in India by Maruti Suzuki as Maruti Zen Estilo in 2006, Maruti Zen Estilo was discontinued in 2009 and renamed as Maruti Estilo. The vehicle's name is somewhat misleading, as it does not sport a rear mid-engine, rear-wheel drive layout (which is often abbreviated as RMR, or more commonly, MR). However, the name \\"Moco\\" was changed in some countries because of the Spanish language meaning of the word \\"moco\\" (\\"snot\\" or \\"booger\\"). __TOC__ == First generation == Suzuki MR Wagon, 1st generation (pre-facelift) Nissan Moco, 1st generation The first generation model went on sale on December 4, 2001, featuring Suzuki's K6A kei car engine, in either naturally aspirated () or turbocharged () versions, available with either front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive. Torque figures are respectively. In all versions, the transmission was a four-speed transmission with column shift. A hydrogen-powered fuel cell vehicle based on the first-generation MR Wagon was presented in 2005, using technology co-developed with General Motors. Later turbocharged versions develop the maximum allowed by kei car regulations, and have of torque. The Nissan Moco version was presented as a concept car on the 35th Tokyo Motor Show in October 2001 and then went on sale on April 10, 2002. The basic engine, drive and transmission choices were the same as for the Suzuki. The major difference between the Nissan and Suzuki versions was the Nissan's \\"wing\\" grille resembling that of the contemporary Nissan Primera P12. The sales of the Nissan version stabilized at about 3,000-4,000 units a month, actually exceeding the MR Wagon's sales. ===Indian market=== The first generation model went on sale in India in December 2006 as the Maruti Suzuki Zen Estilo, supposedly to increase differentiation from the Maruti Suzuki Alto. The Zen Estilo was powered by the larger F10D 1.1-litre four-cylinder 16-valve single overhead camshaft MPFI engine with and that also powers the Wagon R in the Japanese market. 2009 facelift A facelifted variant was released in August 2009 as the Maruti Suzuki Estilo, losing the Zen moniker entirely. This transition has brought about a steady decline in sales, though the facelift brought significant improvements in performance and styling over the car's Japanese variants. The facelifted model featured refreshed styling and the Suzuki K10B 1.0-litre three-cylinder (12-valve) MPFI engine, producing a maximum power output of at 6200 rpm and of torque at 3500 rpm. This model also sported a slightly stiffer rear three-link suspension setup in an effort to curb body roll and improve stability at high speed. Features such as rear fog light, rear defroster, new instrument console and new interior colours were also added to enhance appeal. In February 2014, the Estilo was discontinued in order to make room for the upcoming Maruti Suzuki Celerio hatchback.

Sales began in 2007 with the units imported from Maruti Suzuki India. A facelifted variant was released in late 2009. Sales of the Karimun Estilo were discontinued in late 2012. In October 2013, the Karimun Wagon R replaced the Karimun Estilo.

None of those would eventually make it to the actual MR Wagon, which went on sale on January 20 (Moco on February 1) the following year, while on the other hand the model features the new keyless entry and start system. The engine, drive and shifter choice remained the same, with the same availability in both Nissan and Suzuki versions, but the gear shifter is now located on the instrument panel. As with the first generation, the cars are almost identical in outside appearance, but have different front end designs. This generation of the MR Wagon has the MF22S chassis code; the engines remain the K6A family units. This generation was not built or marketed outside of Japan. ==Third generation== The third generation of the MR Wagon was launched in Japan on January 20, 2011. It carries the MF33S chassis code. A month later the Nissan Moco followed. It has the all new Suzuki R engine, which features variable valve timing and an unusually high compression ratio (11.0:1 for the naturally aspirated version). As of 2013 the engines have been modified, and now features stop-start and other technology intended to lower consumption and emissions. This is the most fuel efficient wagon in the Kei class. In July 2013 the MR Wagon Wit, a better equipped model with a more traditional chromed grille, was introduced. The turbo engine is now restricted to the Wit TS, with all other versions offering the NA engine (L, X, Wit LS, Wit XS). In December 2015, Suzuki announced that the MR Wagon would end its production. Sales of the MR Wagon ended on March 31, 2016, but the Nissan Moco sales ended on May 31, 2016.

It was ported to the Commodore 64, then later released for the Nintendo Entertainment System, Game Boy, Game Gear, and Game Boy Color. Maclean's first commercial game, Dropzone is similar in gameplay and style to the arcade game Defender and borrows many elements, including the same style of font, aliens, and title screen. ==Plot== On the surface of Jupiter's moon, Io, a human scientific research base is under attack by aliens. The player dons a jetpack armed with a laser, a cloaking device and three smart bombs, to rescue the scientists and return them to the base. ==Gameplay== The gameplay is in the style of Williams Electronics' Defender, with some influences from Scramble and Robotron: 2084. Players control the hero trying to rescue the scientists on a horizontally-scrolling game field. Players must elude or engage various aliens--some slow, others faster--and return the scientists to the base's eponymous dropzone. The aliens capture scientists walking along the ground. The player must shoot the enemy aliens and catch the falling scientists. Sometimes the aliens will carry lethal androids instead, which must be avoided. The ranks awarded to players at the end of a game are: # Not Listed - practice recommended # Dextral Dodger # Trekie # Moon Cadet # Planetsman # Ace # Planet Marshal # Planet Lord # Star Warrior # Solar Prodigy # Megastar - mission completed There are 99 levels of gameplay, each increasingly difficult. After level 99, the levels repeat starting level 95. ==Development== Maclean purchased an Atari 800 as soon as they were officially launched in the UK in 1981 and started writing what would eventually evolve into Dropzone. Maclean converted the game to the Commodore 64 himself: The name Dropzone was not settled on until shortly before the game went gold. Maclean entered into a publishing deal with U.S. Gold for the European distribution of the game. After 18 months, however, they stopped paying him royalties claiming that the game was no longer selling. In addition, Maclean saw it for sale in areas outside of Europe and even in the United States. Four years of legal wrangling with the publisher followed, until they finally settled out of court for copyright infringement. With the proceeds from the settlement, Maclean bought his first Ferrari. ==Reception== The Commodore 64 version of the game was awarded a Gold Medal in issue 3 of Zzap!64 magazine, with an overall rating of 95%. ==Legacy== The sequel, Super Dropzone, added new weapon types and end-level bosses. It is available for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (titled Super Dropzone on all packaging, but only Dropzone on the title screen), Game Boy Advance and PlayStation.

He moved to New Zealand in the 1870s, settling in the south-west at Lake Te Anau in 1883 where he worked as a handyman, rabbiter, shepherd, taxidermist, boat-builder, explorer and guide, while studying the birdlife. He also began to write articles on natural history for the Otago Witness and other publications. By 1891 public and governmental concern that introduced mustelids were having a devastating effect on New Zealand's birdlife led to the gazettal of Resolution Island in Fiordland as a reserve. In 1894 Henry was appointed curator and caretaker of Resolution Island,https://www.nzgeo.com/stories/resolution-for-richard-henry/ Resolution for Richard Henry - New Zealand Geographic a position he held for the next 14 years. Over this period he transported numerous flightless birds, including kakapo, weka and kiwi to Resolution Island, with the hope that they would be safe there. Unfortunately, the attempted translocation of kakapo was in vain as stoats reached the island around 1900 and kakapo did not survive there. During the Great War the New Zealand government came and took the iron off Henry's shed. In 1908 increasing concern about Henry's welfare, due to his age and his isolated position on Resolution, led to his being offered the caretakership of Kapiti Island, a post which he accepted and occupied for the next three years, eventually retiring from government service in 1911. In 1912 he moved to Katikati in the Bay of Plenty where he lived until 1922 before moving for the last time to Helensville, north of Auckland. He died in 1929 of senile decay and heart failure. Only the local postmaster attended the funeral.

His wife was the celebrated male impersonator Vesta Tilley. ==Early life== Abraham Walter de Frece was one of four sons of Henry (Harry) de Frece, of the Gaiety Music Hall in Camden Street, Liverpool, who was a prosperous agent in the Roscoe Arcade, a prominent theatrical manager, and a pioneering actors' agent from a large theatrical family. Henry de Frece had his sons educated well in order to keep them out of theatre, with Walter attending the Liverpool Institute and a school in Belgium. However, by the time Walter returned home, his elder brother Jack was managing the Alhambra Wooden Theatre in Manchester Street, Liverpool, and Isaac managed the old Theatre Royal in Clayton Square, Liverpool. Walter's younger brother, Lauri de Frece, later became a celebrated comedian. ==Theatre career== By 1889, Walter was apprenticed with a notable Merseyside architect, when his father's Gaiety Theatre engaged the 25-year-old Tilly Ball as principal boy in pantomime that Christmas. Known professionally as Vesta Tilley (the 'Matchless' little Tilly), as the daughter of the former chairman of the St. George's Hall in Nottingham, Harry Ball, she had been on the stage since the age of four. By 1889 she was well known on the tour circuit as a male impersonator. Walter fell for Tilly, and against romantic competition that included Sir Oswald Stoll, managed to take Tilly to a dance and secure a kiss. This inspired Walter to resign his apprenticeship, and leaving home secured himself a job in the office of Warner's Theatrical Agency. Walter married Tilley at Brixton Register Office on 16 August 1890. accessed 15 January 2008 Noting the decline in popularity of melodrama, and the increase in music hall revenues, de Frece secured the lease on the Metropole Theatre at Camberwell. Leaving Warner's, he turned it into the Camberwell Empire, a modern music hall. After this success, he began building a tour circuit by buying out the leases of other theatres which had fallen on hard times, including: the Grand Theatre, Margate; the Grand Theatre, Colchester; the Prince of Wales, Southampton; and a theatre at Boscombe managed by his brother-in-law, Harry Ball, junior. All were refurbished and renamed \\"Hippodromes,\\" with music hall productions run by his company \\"The South of England Hippodromes, Ltd.,\\" where his wife Tilley was a regular performer. He later added new Hippodromes in both Portsmouth and Southend. After taking over the lease of the Empire Palace, Wolverhampton (later renamed the Hippodrome), in 1906 he joined the board of directors at the Manchester Palace. He then opened the New Tivoli Theatre of Varieties in Lime Street, Liverpool, in December 1906, but being so close to the Empire Palace of Moss and Stoll, the New Tivoli never made a profit. After this setback, in 1908 he bought the old Metropole in Birkenhead, renamed The New Birkenhead Hippodrome, with an opening night that was topped by his wife. He then built his northern chain at a far quicker pace, acquiring the Bolton Hippodrome and then building the new Oldham Palace, which couldn't be named Hippodrome as there already was one in the town. After the death of fellow impresario Thomas Barrasford in 1910, de Frece acquired most of his Barrasford Halls, having formed the holding company \\"Variety Theatres Controlling Company Ltd\\" in partnership with Alfred Butt. By 1914 this also controlled 18 theatres across both Southcoast Hippodromes Ltd and Barrasford Halls Ltd but during World War I, audience taste changed again, and with the advent of moving pictures, many theatres were being converted either in part or whole to new format cinemas. Resultantly, at the end of hostilities and after his knighthood in the 1919 King's Birthday Honours List, de Frece resigned all of his positions, allowing Charles Gulliver to succeed him as managing director of the Variety Theatres Controlling Company. ==Political career== After his decision to concentrate on a career in politics, Vesta Tilley made her last performance in 1920 at the Coliseum Theatre, London, at the age of 56. For the rest of her life she lived as Lady de Frece, and from the mid-1920s the couple made their home on the French Riviera, to assist with her declining health. Sir Walter was first elected as MP for Ashton-under-Lyne at a by-election in 1920, after the constituency's Conservative MP Sir Albert Stanley was elevated to the peerage. Sir Walter was re-elected at the 1922 general election and at the 1923 general election, when his majority was cut to only 239 votes. At the 1924 general election he did not stand again in Ashton-under-Lyne, but moved to the more promising Blackpool constituency, where he was returned with a majority of over 7,000 votes. He held the seat with a similar majority in 1929. He represented Blackpool between the two wars; it was claimed by John Cryer, the Labour MP for Leyton and Wanstead, during a House of Commons debate, that Sir Walter only visited the United Kingdom twice a year, once for the Budget speech and again for Ascot and that he had managed to convince his electorate that he was representing their interests by signing a stack of House of Commons notepaper every time he returned. His secretary, claimed Mr Cryer, would then write responses to each letter from his constituents on the signed notepaper, making it appear to voters that they had received a personal response. It was suggested that although he was once a national MP for Blackpool, he actually never went near the place: \\"in fact he couldn't find it on a map\\". However, based on entries in Hansard, Sir Walter did make a number of contributions to debates in the House of Commons, initially representing his constituents in Ashton-under-Lyne (from 1920 to 1924), and latterly those in Blackpool from (1924 to 1931). ==Later life== The grave of Walter de Frece and his wife Vesta Tilley at Putney Vale Cemetery, London in 2014 In light of the poor health of his wife, he retired from the House of Commons at the 1931 general election, and went to live in the home they had in Monaco. Walter died before his wife, at the age of 64. He is buried in Putney Vale Cemetery, where his wife, who died in 1952 at the age of 88, was later laid to rest beside him. A black granite memorial marks the spot. == References == * * ==External links== * * Category:Theatre people from Merseyside Category:English Jews Category:People educated at Liverpool Institute High School for Boys Category:Impresarios Category:English theatre managers and producers Category:Conservative Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies Category:UK MPs 1918‚Äì1922 Category:UK MPs 1922‚Äì1923 Category:UK MPs 1923‚Äì1924 Category:UK MPs 1924‚Äì1929 Category:UK MPs 1929‚Äì1931 Category:English expatriates in Monaco Category:Burials at Putney Vale Cemetery Category:1870 births Category:1935 deaths Category:Knights Bachelor Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for Ashton-under-Lyne Category:Jewish British politicians ","title":"Walter de Frece"},{"id":"9106500","text":"The Menomonee Falls Guardian was a tabloid published in the mid-1970s by Street Enterprises (based in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin) that reprinted humor comic strips from the United States and the UK.

From 1576 to 1616 he was Rector of Wollaton 1576-1616, and from 1 May 1578 to 1616 Vicar of St Mary's Church, Nottingham. He was the last Vicar of St Mary's Nottingham to have the Crown as patron until 1973. It was in 1598, during the incumbency of Robert Aldridge, that the Crown sold the patronage of St Mary's to Sir Henry Pierrepont. On 26 July 1592, Thomas Clerke, of Nottingham, faced a charge in the Archdeaconry court, hee is presented for fightinge in the church with Robert Whitcombe. On 29 July he appeared and answered that upon a sondaie a fourtnight or three weekes sins in the church of saint Marie this respondent and others were ringinge of the belles and then and there this respondent did take a possie of flowers from Roberte Whitecombe the sextone, which Whitcombe demaunded them, and he denieinge to restore them the said sexton spake to him thus: thou shalt have my lief before thou have theim. and with that the sexton pulled this respondentes hat over his head and gave him a blowe on the eare with his hand. Whereuppon this jurate resisted him and others cominge upon theim at whose hand hee feared hurte, hee drawe his dagger and with it strake the sexton over the arme because he held him this jurate by the bosome and would not let him go. And then the judge, accepting this confession, as he was and is bound, pronounced the said Clerke to have ipso facto incurred the sentence of excommunication by virtue of the statue in that case provided. Then Mr Gymney, by virtue of order of the judge, absolved the said Thomas Clarke from the sentence of excommunication pronounced on account of his contempt of court. John Darrell, of Queens' College, Cambridge, was appointed by Robert Aldridge as curate. Darrell already had a reputation for being involved in cases of exorcism. Before long, he was involved again, this time in the case of William Sommers, who suffered from fits, or, as Darrell claimed, demonic possession. Darrell was accused of fraudulent exorcism and removed from his position by John Whitgift, Archbishop of Canterbury. From the archdeaconry court records for 2 August 1606, William Little Feere and Marmaduke Gregorie, churchwardens of St Mary's Church, Nottingham were warned to see that the church of St. Mary, Nottingham was duly decorated in due form with the sentences of the Holy Scriptures before Michaelmas. The churchwardens were also under pressure to repair the chancel, damaged by a storm in 1588. The repairs seem to still be outstanding as late as 1632. There are frequent entries in the Archdeaconry Records and include charges against the Vicar. From the Churchwardens' Presentment Bills for April 21, 1612. St. Maries in Nott. *We the Churchwardens, here undernamed, do find that our chancell is in decay, but in whose defaulte we cannot lerne perfitly. *Item we present Mr. Robte. Alderidg Clarke and our Vicar for selling a grave stone from the chancell. *Item we present Mr. Robte. Alderidg, for burying nottoris fellons in the chancell. On the same day in the Archdeaconry Court, a licence was granted to John Sherot to read prayers in St. Mary, Nottingham and to teach children the alphabet (cum licentia ad decendum pueros Abcedarios). The Register shows that Robert Aldridge was buried in the church, but his memorial has perished. ==References== *Muriel Clara Bradbrook, Shakespeare: the poet in his world, Taylor & Francis, 1980, , p. 195 *Benjamin Brook, The lives of the Puritans: containing a biographical account of those divines who distinguished themselves in the cause of religious liberty, from the reformation under Queen Elizabeth, to the Act of uniformity in 1662, Volume 2, J.

His grandson, Saen Phu, ruler of the Lanna Kingdom, founded Chiang Saen in 1325 or 1328. The city was sacked by Chao Kawila of Chiangmai during the reign of Rama I, because it had been the Burmese base of operations in the preceding years. The city was deserted, while its inhabitants resettled in other Bangkok-allied Lanna cities such as Lampang and Chiang Mai. Several ancient ruins are found in the old cities. For example, Wat Pa Sak hosts a well-preserved Lanna-style phrathat. The mueang was converted into a district at the beginning of the 20th century in the Thesaphiban reforms, with an additional branch or minor district (king amphoe) also named Chiang Saen covering the central area. The minor district was abolished in 1925. The minor district was recreated two years later, then named Chiang Saen Luang (‡πÄ‡∏ä‡∏µ‡∏¢‡∏á‡πÅ‡∏™‡∏ô‡∏´‡∏•‡∏ß‡∏á). In 1939 the minor district was renamed Chiang Saen, while the former district Chiang Saen became Mae Chan. The minor district was upgraded to a full district on 6 April 1957. ==Geography== The Mekong River borders the north end of the district, forming the boundary with Laos. Other important rivers are the Kok and the Ruak River, tributaries of the Mekong.

The area around the confluence of the Mekong with the Ruak River is known as the Golden Triangle. This boundary region with Laos and Myanmar is now a popular tourist area, with several casinos on the Burmese side. ==Administration== The district is divided into six sub-districts (tambons), which are further subdivided into 72 villages (mubans).

It will occupy 3,139 rai in three Chiang Saen sub-districts: Wiang, Pa Sak, and Yonok. The site will include zones for luxury holiday facilities, and with what Trin calls a world-class health centre, condominiums, a premium shopping complex, souvenir shops, an international convention centre and community and local product OTOP stores. The project is expected to create over 10,000 jobs, ranging from labourers to service professionals and industry experts. The Chiang Saen District is to be the site of the world's tallest flagpole when it is completed in 2020. The pole, to be 189 m tall, the equivalent of a 63-storey building, will take about a year to complete at a cost of from 250 million baht to two billion baht. The originator of the project, Mr Trin Nilprasert, aims to promote \\"Thainess\\" and Thai identity. The flagpole is to be set in a park complete with a museum and a learning centre. It will fly a Thai flag measuring 60 metres wide by 40 metres and will be visible from 20 kilometres away. ==References*Chiang Saen data (Thai) *amphoe.com *Birdwatching in Chiang Saen on thaibirding.com *Yonok Wetlands near Chiang Saen ‚Äî Chiang Saen ","title":"Chiang Saen District"},{"id":"9106544","text":"Karen McCluskey (n√©e Simonds) is a fictional character from the ABC television series Desperate Housewives. The role was played by Kathryn Joosten, who won the Primetime Emmy Award twice for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series in 2005 and 2008. In the series finale, Karen succumbs to cancer. This was agreed upon between Marc Cherry and Kathryn, as she was battling cancer in real life, as well. Kathryn Joosten died 20 days after the series finale aired. ==HistoryPast=== Karen Simonds was born in 1943, quickly wed and gave birth to a son in the 1960s. In season six she reveals to Robin Gallagher (Julie Benz) that she was in the sex trade business and modeled for Sears Roebuck, which put her through college. She was the second wife to Gilbert McCluskey (John Harnagel) since the year 1963. They moved into Fairview, 4358 Wisteria Lane in 1982. Gilbert neglected to update his pension files leaving all of his assets to his first wife, to whom he was only married for two years. He died in 1997 and since then Karen kept his body in a freezer in her basement for the next 10 years. She has two sisters, Gale - mentioned in the third season - and Roberta Simonds (Lily Tomlin). ===Season 1=== Karen McCluskey is introduced in the series as a neighborhood nemesis of Lynette Scavo. In the season one episode Live Alone and Like It (episode 19) we learn that she suffers from severe arthritis and how Lynette helped her when she collapsed soon after they became good friends. Known as the bickering old woman of the neighborhood, Mrs. McCluskey can be constantly known for bickering and causing ruckus. However, deep down Mrs. McCluskey is a really good woman full of love. It was revealed that she had a son that died at age twelve. She offered to babysit the Scavo kids only to be sent home because Lynette found her to be 'ancient'. ===Season 2=== One time, Mrs. McCluskey accidentally tasered Lynette's co-worker Stu when she believed he was trying to \\"abduct\\" Lynette's kids. She was reported to have seen Matthew Applewhite and Danielle Van de Kamp making out at the county park. In episode 15 of season 2, she found Bree passed out on the front lawn. She subsequently alerted Lynette that Bree was drinking while babysitting her kids. Bree's drinking problems inadvertently improved Mrs. McCluskey's relationship with Lynette, as she now frequently babysits the Scavo kids. Towards the end of Season 2 she supported Lynette, who followed Tom Scavo to Atlantic City in a bid to find out the truth behind Tom's supposed infidelity. ===Season 3=== She has emerged as a more prominent and visible character in Season 3, often involved in social roles with members of Wisteria Lane and even forming a friendship with Edie Britt. It has also been notable that due to the very separate story that Bree Hodge has this season, Mrs. McCluskey is often seen gathering with the other three main housewives Lynette Scavo, Gabrielle Solis and Susan Mayer. Recently, Mrs. McCluskey gave Mike Delfino his toolbox back (which later got him arrested despite her hiding it), and helped form the protest against the suspected pedophile Art Shephard. In the episode \\"Liaisons\\", it was revealed that Mrs. McCluskey has her own secret: she has the dead body of her husband, Gilbert, stored in a chest freezer in her basement. In the following episode, \\"God, That's Good\\" Karen breaks her arm, and is taken to hospital. In the meantime, first Parker Scavo, then Ida Greenberg discovers Gilbert's dead body. Karen manages to persuade Parker to keep quiet, but Ida goes to the police, and Karen is later put into jail. Mrs. McCluskey is the talk of the town after the news spreads about her husband's body being found in the freezer. She becomes hassled by local kids, who throw eggs at her house, and paint 'Witch' on her door. Lynette also changes baby sitters to keep her away from her children, but Parker continues to defend her and tells Mrs. McCluskey to just tell the truth to make it stop. She goes to Travers' birthday party while the other Wisteria Lane residents are cleaning up and reveals her actions. She explains that she came home at 2 am from a weekend away to find Gilbert had died. Waiting until morning to call the Funeral Home, she checks his pension plan to see he had signed everything off to his first wife. Mrs. McCluskey, in fear of losing everything, kept his body in the freezer and kept cashing the checks. Lynette then hires Mrs. McCluskey back as her babysitter. Lynette tells Mrs. McCluskey the family missed her, and Mrs. McCluskey says she missed them too. As she walks into her house Mrs. McCluskey says that she will need a raise as she has a lot of money to pay and holds up bills. ===Season 4=== Mrs. McCluskey asks to speak to Carlos and complains to him about the garbage he left out being late and almost foils Edie's fake suicide plan but notices her at the last minute. Later at Katherine Mayfair's barbecue, she questions Katherine as to why she left town twelve years ago without saying any goodbyes to anyone and Katherine is shocked that she remembers so much.Season 4 episode 1 It is revealed that Karen used to babysit Dylan Mayfair, and knew something about her father, even though Dylan insists her father left her when she was a baby.Season 4 episode 2 Karen later gives her opinion on new neighbors Bob and Lee's water fountain by saying it's \\"crap\\". When Katherine and Lynette both run for the job of the leader of the home owners association Karen casts her vote for Lynette although Katherine wins anyway.Season 4 episode 5 In \\"Something's Coming\\", Mrs. McCluskey reluctantly invites Lynette Scavo and her family to take shelter in her house because of a tornado. But when she invites Ida Greenberg and her pet cat Toby to also take shelter, things get complicated as Lynette's husband Tom is allergic to cats. So Lynette tries to smuggle Toby out of the house. When Karen catches Lynette smuggling Toby from the basement, Lynette angrily accuses her of choosing a cat over Tom. Suddenly the door blows open and Toby escapes. As Karen tries to get Toby back into her house, Lynette catches her and then they see the tornado coming. They try to get back into the house, but when things block their way, they enter Lynette's house and take refuge in the bathtub. Later, when the tornado ends, they step outside, only to find Mrs. McCluskey's house in ruins.Season 4 episode 9 In \\"Welcome to Kanagawa\\", Mrs. McCluskey sees Lynette's children and husband recovered safely from the ruins of Karen's house. But unfortunately, Ida didn't survive the tornado. As Lynette and Karen pack Ida's belongings, they think of spreading the ashes inside a baseball stadium, but things get complicated as Ida's niece and nephew take the urn back to Omaha, Nebraska, not knowing that Ida's ashes were replaced by dust from a vacuum cleaner inside the urn. Later that night, Mrs. McCluskey and Lynette break into the baseball stadium and spread Ida's ashes around the field, but get caught by the police. The police let Mrs. McCluskey and Lynette off with a warning. Karen almost had her third strike as she and Lynette know that it wouldn't be enough. In the season finale \\"Free\\" the show skips five years later and by this time Karen would be 69. Five- year jump Karen McCluskey is shown to still be a gossip-loving resident on Wisteria Lane, and is also shown to be very healthy (much to Edie's shock). ===Season 5=== After the five-year leap for the fifth season, Karen is shown to be alive and well. When Edie returns to Fairview with her new husband, Dave Williams, Karen welcomes her back and teases her like they used to do. When Edie gets upset, Dave asks Karen to stop, but she refuses. Later, Toby the cat goes missing. Karen asks Dave to help her look for him, but he won't. When Karen refuses again to apologize to Edie, she suspects that Dave took Toby. Karen apologizes to Edie and asks her to tell Dave she did so. That night, Toby is back. Karen's suspicions of Dave grow, and she enlists the help of Katherine to find out more information. A few episodes later, it's Karen's 70th birthday and the residents organize a surprise party for her at Susan's house. However, when Dave breaks into Karen's house and moves stuff around in order to annoy her, Karen arrives at the party with a baseball bat and goes to attack Dave but is stopped and taken away in an ambulance. In the hospital, Edie visits her and Karen apologizes, saying her pills had made her attack Dave. After Edie leaves, Karen reveals it was all an act and calls her sister Roberta, asking her to come over. Together they try to find out about Dave's past, and they discover he was a patient of a psychiatrist, Dr. Heller. When they visit, however, the doctor is not there (he was actually killed by Dave the episode before), and Roberta tells Karen she cannot help anymore and leaves. In the eighteenth episode of the season, Karen hangs out with Edie, who tells Karen about how Dave lost his wife and daughter in a car accident. Karen apologizes, saying she wouldn't have done what she did to Dave if she knew that as she lost a child herself and knows what it can do to a person. In the following episode, Edie dies due to being electrocuted. Karen, along with Susan, Gabrielle, Bree and Lynette, is asked by Dave to take her ashes to her son Travers. When they tell Travers about the death, he is not visibly upset, saying Edie was not a good mom and did not even attempt to raise him. Angry, Karen tells Travers about how some years back, Edie comforted Karen on the anniversary of her son's death and told her that she wanted Travers to be brought up properly and she knew she wouldn't have been a good mother to him. Travers then becomes upset over her death and tells the ladies to take the ashes. Karen, being the closest to Edie, tries to figure out what to do with the ashes when suddenly her front door gently blows open. Karen comes up with the idea to spread Edie's ashes through the neighborhood. In the fifth-season finale, Karen and Roberta again try to find out more information about Dave by breaking into Edie's house after Roberta gets a call from Dr. Heller's receptionist saying he died in the fire. Karen and Roberta are caught by the police and taken to the station, where they discover Dave's ex-wife and daughter were killed in the accident that involved Mike and Susan. Roberta then mentions how freaky it was that Dave changed his name and went to live near the people who were involved with his loved ones' deaths. ===Season 6=== Karen is given a love interest this season named Roy Bender. When Gaby offers to collect Karen from the grocery store, Karen spends the whole time in the car talking about her sex life with Roy. She later watches as Julie Mayer fights with her new neighbor Danny Bolen on the street. The first time Karen McCluskey met Roy Bender she smiled at him to her surprise. The next time they met, Roy smiled back. They then continued to flirt for a week until they decided to sleep together. They went out for weeks until one day Karen decided she needed to know how he felt while they were out for a walk, Karen told Roy that she loved him. Roy didn't respond until Karen urged him on. He was about to tell her he loved her when he noticed Julie Mayer unconscious in a garden. Karen then screamed at the top of her voice, informing Wisteria Lane of Julie's brutal attack. Later Karen tells Roy that she doesn't know whether she should tell the police that she saw Julie and Danny Bolen fighting on the street a few days previous. She tells him that she doesn't want to point fingers. Roy then tells her she should tell them because she doesn't have to do it alone. He then tells her that he would be sad if Karen got hit by a bus but when Karen says that he will have to shower alone tonight, Roy tells her that he loves her. Karen later watches as Danny is arrested. She later visits Katherine Mayfair at the mental hospital she is staying to encourage her to come back to Wisteria Lane. She later brings the housewives with her to convince her to come back. In the sixth-season episode, \\"The Chase\\", Karen gets engaged to Roy, and learns she has lung cancer. However, two episodes later in \\"My Two Young Men\\" we learn that Karen has already beaten cancer, and Roy throws a party for her, which all the neighbors of Wisteria Lane attend. ===Season 7=== Karen alerts the women of Paul Young's return in the first episode \\"Remember Paul?\\". In the fourth episode, Karen is concerned when Paul asks her to sell him her house because she might die soon. Later Karen tells Beth Young about Martha Huber and how everybody believed Paul had killed her. Roy returns in \\"A Humiliating Business\\" where it is revealed that he and Karen have now married, making him her second husband. She is knocked down in the Riot, and is helped up by Lynette. She then lets Porter and Preston live at her house when Lynette tells them to find a place of their own, however their time is short lived as Karen kicks them out after they have a house party. In \\"The Lies Ill-Concealed\\" Karen is visited by Felicia Tilman and is shocked to learn that she has moved next door. Felicia talks about the night she fled from Wisteria Lane and Karen recalls that she saw her and decided to keep the fact that Paul did not actually murder Felicia to herself. Later, Karen visits Felicia where she is surprised to learn that Beth was Felicia's daughter. She agrees to help Felicia keep an eye on Paul. ===Season 8=== Karen and Roy have an argument, and she kicks him out of the house, so Roy stays in Gabrielle's house. Soon, both of them realize that they miss each other, but Gabrielle wants to keep Roy in her house because he can control Juanita and Celia. Meanwhile, Karen is diagnosed with terminal lung cancer and decides not to tell Roy because he has lost a wife before. He eventually finds out and chides her for thinking he wouldn't be strong enough to handle this again, and they reunite. In the series finale, Karen is preparing to head to a hospice, but the women of the Lane insist on taking care of her themselves, making Karen realize how much they care for her. When she overhears Gabrielle and Carlos talking about Carlos killing Gabby's abusive stepfather, Karen decides to pay her friends back. She goes on the stand at Bree's murder trial and confesses to killing Alejandro herself, using details she overheard from Gaby and Carlos to convince the jury. While doubtful of Karen's story, the district attorney realizes the damage is done. The case is thrown out, and no charges are pressed against Karen due to her age and illness. Karen dies at home, listening to the song \\"Wonderful! Wonderful!\\" sung by Johnny Mathis. Then her spirit is seen joining those who have died over the years on Wisteria Lane. She is seen in the final scene of the show reunited with her son. ==Behind the scenes== *Kathryn Joosten mentioned on the talk show The View and subsequent interviews that Marc Cherry promised her not to kill off her character. Joosten explained that Marc Cherry felt badly about all her previous characters being killed off. In a subsequent interview Kathryn said, \\"Marc (Cherry) did not vow to not kill Karen because she was 'loved.' He and I made that agreement when I came on the show because I'd just been killed off on a bunch of shows and I didn't want that to happen again.\\"'Interview with Kathryn Joosten' MetroSeeker.com retrieved March 12, 2012 Joosten reported that Cherry came to her and asked her if she minded if he broke his promise and change her fate for the very last episode of the series. She did not, but she mentioned to him that she wanted her opinion considered on the way it would be done. Her character, Karen, was eventually killed off but lasted until the series final episode \\"Finishing the Hat.\\" *After frequently appearing as a guest star for the first five seasons, Kathryn Joosten was promoted at the start of Season 6, listed as \\"also-starring\\", but still is only credited for the episodes that she appears in. Due to a relapse of cancer, Joosten was absent for several episodes during the first half of the sixth season. Kathryn Joosten was promoted yet again, and starting with Season 7 is credited as \\"starring\\", but still only in the episodes she appears. For the eighth and final season, Joosten has returned to her previous status as \\"also-starring\\". *Kathryn Joosten was a two-time lung cancer survivor and was the national spokesperson for the Lung Cancer Profiles campaign on behalf of Pfizer.'Interview with Kathryn Joosten' MetroSeeker.com retrieved March 12, 2012. *Kathryn Joosten herself died of lung cancer just 20 days after the final episode of Desperate Housewives was broadcast. Her character died of the same disease. *Kathryn Joosten won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series in 2005 and 2008, and received another nomination in 2010. In 2012, Joosten received her first Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series nomination, which was also her last Emmy nomination before she died. ==References== Category:Desperate Housewives characters Category:Television characters introduced in 2005 Category:Fictional housewives Category:Fictional characters with cancer ","title":"Karen McCluskey"},{"id":"9106554","text":"Kazys Bizauskas House in Kaunas where Kazys Bizauskas lived in 1933‚Äì1940 Kazys Bizauskas (1893, PƒÅvilosta, Courland Governorate ‚Äì 26 June 1941) was a Lithuanian statesman, diplomat, author, and one of the twenty signatories of the Act of Independence of Lithuania. Bizauskas first emerged as a writer while attending secondary school in Kaunas; he issued a hand-written periodical, Ateitis (The Future). He studied law at Moscow University from 1913 to 1915. After returning, he taught secondary school in Panevƒó≈æys. During the Conference of Vilnius he was elected to the Council of Lithuania as its secretary, and signed the Act of Independence in 1918. In 1920 Bizauskas was elected to the Constituent Assembly as a representative of the Christian Democratic Party. During the summer of 1920 he served as secretary-general at the negotiations that led to the formalization of the Soviet-Lithuanian Treaty of 1920. He held a number of diplomatic posts during the 1920s and 1930s, serving as Lithuanian envoy to the Vatican, the United States, the United Kingdom, Latvia, and the Netherlands. He also authored a secondary school textbook, contributed numerous articles to periodicals, and co-founded the Society of Bibliophiles and the publishing house ≈Ωinija. After the first Soviet occupation of Lithuania in 1940, he returned to his farm near Ukmergƒó, where he was arrested and held in prison until Nazi Germany declared war on the USSR on 22 June 1941.

They powered a number of military aircraft types of the First World War. Le Rh√¥ne engines were also produced under license worldwide. Although not powerful (the largest wartime version produced ), they were dependable rotary engines.Le Rhone Rotary Engine Retrieved on 18 February 2009. The Le Rh√¥ne 9 was a development of the Le Rh√¥ne 7, a seven-cylinder design. Examples of nine-cylinder Le Rh√¥ne rotary engines are on public display in aviation museums with several remaining airworthy, powering vintage aircraft types. ==Operation== In most respects the Le Rh√¥ne engines were typical rotary engines, so that the crankshaft remained stationary in operation, with the entire crankcase and its attached cylinders rotating around it as a unit. The copper induction tubes had their crankcase ends located in different places on the versions; the 80 hp versions had them entering the crankcase in a location forward of the vertical center-line of each cylinder, while the 110 hp version had them located behind the cylinder's center-line. This resulted in the 80 hp version's intake plumbing being \\"fully visible\\" from the front, while the 110 hp version had the lower ends of its intake tubes seemingly \\"hidden\\" behind the cylinders. A complicated slipper bearing system was used in the Le Rh√¥ne engine. The master rod was of a split- type, which permitted assembly of the connecting rods. It also employed three concentric grooves, designed to accept slipper bearings from the other cylinders. The other connecting rods used inner-end bronze shoes, which were shaped to fit in the grooves. The master rod was numbered as number one and the shoes of numbers two, five and eight rode in the outer groove, the shoes of three, six and nine in the middle groove and four and seven in the inner groove. Although this system was complex, the Le Rh√¥ne engines worked very well.Gunston 1989, p.93. The Le Rh√¥ne engines used an unconventional valve actuation system, with a single centrally-pivoting rocker arm moving the exhaust valve and the intake valve. When the arm moved down it opened the intake valve and when it moved up it opened the exhaust valve. To make this system work a two-way push-pull rod was fitted, instead of the more conventional one-way pushrod. This feature required the cam followers to incorporate a positive action, a function designed in by using a combination of links and levers. This design prevented valve overlap and so limited power output, but as the engine structure and cooling arrangements would not have been adequate at a higher power output, this should not be considered a significant design fault. ==Production== As well as production by Soci√©t√© des Moteurs Gnome et Rh√¥ne, which had bought out Soci√©t√© des Moteurs Le Rh√¥ne in 1914, the Le Rh√¥ne was produced in Germany (by Motorenfabrik Oberursel), Austria, the United Kingdom (by Daimler), Russian Empire and Sweden. le Rh√¥ne engines were made under license in the United States by Union Switch and Signal of Pennsylvania, and the Oberursel Ur.II rotary engine used by Germany in World War I, in such famous fighters such as the Fokker Dr.I triplane, was a close copy of the le Rh√¥ne 9J version. ==Variants== Data from : Oberursel Ur.II, a clone of the Le Rh√¥ne 9J ;Le Rh√¥ne Type 7A :(1910) , seven-cylinder rotary engine ‚Äî twenty built for use on Borel Monoplanes and Sommer Biplanes. ;Le Rh√¥ne Type 7B :(1911) , seven-cylinder rotary engine ‚Äî Thirty-five prototype engines built. ;Le Rh√¥ne Type 7B2 :(1912) , seven-cylinder rotary engine ‚Äî 350 built at Societe Moteurs le Rh√¥ne. ;Le Rh√¥ne Type 7Z :40hp ;Le Rh√¥ne Type 9C :(1916) , nine-cylinder rotary engine. ;Le Rh√¥ne Type 9J :(1913) , nine-cylinder rotary engine. ;Le Rh√¥ne Type 9Ja :(1915) , nine-cylinder rotary engine. ;Le Rh√¥ne Type 9Jb :(1916) , nine-cylinder rotary engine. ;Le Rh√¥ne Type 9Jby :(1916) , nine-cylinder rotary engine.

The Oberursel Ur.II was a straight copy of the Le Rh√¥ne, but the Le Rh√¥ne was preferred over the Oberursel due to the materials used in the French product. However, by July 1918 there was a shortage in Germany of castor oil, a plant-derived lubricant that the rotaries required, as it could not be easily dissolved into the fuel and because it possessed lubrication qualities superior to mineral oils of the day.General rotary engine lubrication information from Gnome Monosoupape Type N Rotary Retrieved on 18 February 2009. A new Voltol-based lubricant, derived from mineral oil, was substituted and was blamed for engine failures on German fighters such as the Fokker E.V, which used the Oberursel Ur.II. It has been suggested that without proper lubricants, the Le Rh√¥ne rotary would have been equally failure-prone. A reproduction of the Oberursel has been manufactured by The Vintage Aviator Company in New Zealand in very limited numbers by reverse engineering an original Oberursal engine, presumably for their own project aircraft. The engine has been test-run and is described at http://thevintageaviator.co.nz/projects/oberursel-engine/oberursel-ur-ii- rotary-engine-build-history. ===Le Rh√¥nes still flying today=== Several enthusiasts are using original Le Rh√¥ne engines for World War I replica aircraft today. A flying example can be seen at the Pioneer Flight Museum, Kingsbury Texas in a replica Fokker Dr 1. pioneerflightmuseum.org The engine had previously been flown in an original Thomas Morse Scout, which is now under restoration with another Le Rh√¥ne 80 hp engine planned for that flying aircraft. There are other reproductions of Dr 1's flying original Le Rh√¥ne engines, as well as the restored Thomas Morse Scouts in the United States. ==Applications== Le Rh√¥ne 9J mounted in the front of a Cierva C.6 autogyro replica, displayed in \\"Museo del Aire\\", Cuatro Vientos, Madrid, Spain A Le Rh√¥ne radial engine on display at the Frontiers of Flight Museum * Adamoli- Cattani fighter * Airco DH.5 * Avro 504 * Bristol M.1 * Bristol Scout * Caudron G.3 * Caudron G.4 * Hanriot HD.1 * Fokker Dr.I * Cierva C.6, autogyro, 1924 * Macchi M.14 * Morane-Saulnier N * Mosca MB 2 bis * Nieuport 10 * Nieuport 11 \\"Bebe\\" * Nieuport 16 * Nieuport 17, 21 & 23 * Nieuport 24 & 24bis * Nieuport 27 * Sopwith Camel * Sopwith Pup * Standard E-1 * Texas-Temple prototype * Thomas-Morse S-4C ==See also== *Clerget aircraft engines *Gnome Monosoupape *Gnome et Rh√¥ne ==ReferencesNotes=Bibliography=== * * Gunston, Bill.

The horseshoe vortex model is a simplified representation of the vortex system of a wing. In this model the wing vorticity is modelled by a bound vortex of constant circulation, travelling with the wing, and two trailing wingtip vortices, therefore having a shape vaguely reminiscent of a horseshoe.Millikan, Clark B., Aerodynamics of the Airplane, Figure 1.35McCormick, Barnes W., Aerodynamics, Aeronautics, and Flight Mechanics, Chapter 3 A starting vortex is shed as the wing begins to move through the fluid, which dissipates under the action of viscosity, as do the trailing vortices far behind the aircraft. The trailing wingtip vortices are responsible for the component of the downwash which creates induced drag.McCormick, Barnes W., Aerodynamics, Aeronautics, and Flight Mechanics, Chapter 4 The horseshoe vortex model is unrealistic in that it implies uniform circulation (and hence, according to the Kutta‚ÄìJoukowski theorem, uniform lift) at all sections on the wingspan. In a more realistic model, the lifting- line theory, the vortex strength varies along the wingspan, and the loss in vortex strength is shed as a vortex sheet all along the trailing edge, rather than as a single trail at the wing-tips.McCormick, Barnes W., Aerodynamics, Aeronautics, and Flight Mechanics, Figure 4.21 Nevertheless, the simpler horseshoe vortex model used with a reduced effective wingspan but same mid- plane circulation provides an adequate model for the flows induced far from the aircraft. The term horseshoe vortex is also used in wind engineering to describe the flow pattern created by strong winds around the base of a tall building. This effect is amplified by the presence of a low-rise building just upwind. This effect was studied at the UK Building Research Establishment between 1963 and 1973Penwarden, AD. Wise, AFE. Wind environment around buildings, cover illustration and the cause of the effect is described in contemporary wind engineering text books.Cook, NJ. The designer's guide to wind loading of building structures, Part 1, Figure 8.7 In hydrodynamics, a form of horseshoe vortex forms around bluff bodies in the flowing water, for instance around bridge piers. They can cause scouring of bed materials from both upstream and downstream of the pier. In nature, a horseshoe vortex can cause a horseshoe cloud to form. ==Notes== ==References== * Anderson, John D.

He was Vicar of Croft and Kirkby-on-Bain, Lincolnshire from 1719 to 1722, and Vicar of St. Mary's Church, Nottingham from 2 October 1722 to 1729/30.Illustrations of the Literary History of the Eighteenth Century. Volume 6. John Bowyer Nichols. He was the first of four John Disneys; father of John Disney of Lincoln, grandfather of John Disney (Unitarian) (1746‚Äì1816), and great-grandfather of John Disney (1779‚Äì1857) the barrister and antiquarian. ==Life== He was born in Lincoln, the son of Daniel Disney of Swinderby. He began his education at Lincoln Grammar School, but his parents were dissenters and he moved school to a private college, also in Lincoln. Despite his upbringing, he was confirmed in the Church of England, sometime before 1698. In May of that year, he married Mary Woodhouse. He entered the Middle Temple in order to study law, but with no intention of practising at the bar. He gained sufficient knowledge to act as a competent magistrate and more than once was publicly complimented by the judges of the circuit for being efficient and impartial. As a supporter of the Societies for the Reformation of Manners, he was working on a publication Corpus Legum de Moribus Reformandis shortly before his death. Until the age of 42 he worked as a lay churchman and then he entered holy orders, encouraged by the Archbishop of Canterbury, William Wake, who had been bishop of Lincoln in Disney's early days. He was ordained priest in Lincoln Cathedral in 1719 by the bishop of Lincoln, Edmund Gibson, and immediately took the nearby livings of Croft and Kirkby-on-Bain. He resigned in 1722 to become vicar of St. Mary's Church, Nottingham. The story for which Disney is remembered involves the buccaneering Archbishop Blackburne performing confirmation in St. Mary's. At the end of the proceedings, the archbishop sent out his messenger to fetch his pipe, tobacco and some ale. The messenger, returning laden up the aisle, was ejected by the Rev. John Disney with the words Neither Bishop nor Archbishop shall make a tippling house of St. Mary's so long as I am its Vicar. ==Death and legacy== Upon his death in 1729-30, he left a widow and eight children, five sons and three daughters. The entry for his death in the parish registers is followed by the abbreviation \\"Aff.\\". This was in accordance with the law passed in 1678, which demanded an affidavit that the bodies had been buried in woollen shrouds. His eldest son, John Disney of Lincoln, was High Sheriff of Nottinghamshire in 1733. His writing mostly relating to the Societies for the Reformation of Manners was prolific, but he also found time to research and publish The Genealogy of the most Serene and Illustrious House of Brunswick- Lunenburgh, the present Royal Family of Great Britain in 1714. ==References== *Dictionary of National Biography Category:Vicars of St Mary's Church, Nottingham Category:1677 births Category:1730 deaths Category:People from Lincoln, England Category:18th-century English Anglican priests Category:People educated at Lincoln Grammar School ","title":"John Disney (priest)"},{"id":"9106589","text":"Barkarby Trading place Barkarby is a district of J√§rf√§lla Municipality, Stockholm County, Sweden and part of the contiguously built-up Stockholm urban area.

(retrieved 25 Sept 2011) == Background == Naiche, whose name in English means \\"meddlesome one\\" or \\"mischief maker\\", is alternately spelled Nache, Nachi, or Natchez. He was the youngest son of Cochise and his wife Dos-teh-seh (Dos-tes-ey, - \\"Something-at-the-campfire-already-cooked\\", b. 1838), His older brother was Tah-zay aka Chief Taza. Naiche was described as a tall, handsome man with a dignified bearing that reflected the Apache equivalent of a royal bloodline as the son of Cochise (leader of the Chihuicahui local group of the Chokonen and principal chief of the Chokonen band of the Chiricahua Apache) and Dos-teh- seh, daughter of the great Warm Spring/Mimbre√±o Chief Mangas Coloradas. Britton Davis described him as being 6'1\\" in height, which was tall for an Apache. He had three wives, Haozinne, E-Clah-he, and Na-deh-yole, and six children. == Career == Upon the death of his father Cochise in 1874, Naiche's brother Taza became the chief; however, Taza died a few years later in 1876, and the office went to Naiche. In the 1880s, Naiche and Geronimo successfully went to war together. In 1880, Naiche traveled to Mexico with Geronimo's band, to avoid forced relocation to the San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation in Arizona. They surrendered in 1883 but escaped the reservation in 1885, back into Mexico. Officially the leader of the last band of renegade Apaches in the Southwest, Naiche and Geronimo surrendered to General Nelson Miles in 1886. Naiche and other Apaches requested to return to Arizona, while still imprisoned in Fort Marion. The US did not allow their return, but Kiowa and Comanche tribes offered to share their reservations in southwestern Oklahoma with the Chiricahua, so Naiche and 295 members of his band moved to Fort Sill, Oklahoma, where they became the Fort Sill Apache Tribe. In 1913, Naiche moved to the Mescalero Indian Reservation in New Mexico. Naiche's painting Naiche had the reputation of being the finest Indian artist of that period. He painted his pictures on deer skin in color. His subjects were flowers, deer, other wild animals, turkey, and various objects of nature, as he saw them. He also carved canes from wood and painted them in different colors. == Death == Naiche died of influenza on March 16, 1919 in Mescalero, New Mexico. Among his descendants: * Elbys Onea Naiche Hugar * Silas Cochise == In fiction == Naiche is one of the central characters in the novel Cry of Eagles by William W. Johnstone.

She was married to Rem Koolhaas and best known as one of the co-founders of the Office of Metropolitan Architecture (OMA) in the early 1970s (together with Rem Koolhaas and Elia Zenghelis and Zoe Zenghelis). Vriesendorp would often create visuals and graphics for OMA in the early years. == Biography == Madelon Vriesendorp was born 1945, Bilthoven, Netherlands. She attended Rietveld Academy in Amsterdam in 1964. In 1969, she attended classes at St. Martin‚Äôs School of Art in London. For many years Vriesendorp contributed to Office of Metropolitan Architecture (OMA) by providing graphics and illustrations for the publications of their theoretical concepts. Her painting \\"Flagrant Delit\\" (English: Flagrant Crime) (1978) is recognizable and was used as the cover image for Delirious New York, written by Rem Koolhaas and first published in 1978. Flagrant Delit features the Empire State building and the Chrysler building of New York City, post coitus in bed together while outside the window an armless version of the Statue of Liberty looks sad. Vriesendorp noted that both buildings were built in the 1930s in New York City and were competing to be the tallest in the skyline, however the Empire State building appeared more masculine when compared to the Chrysler building. Koolhaas suggested she add in the Rockefeller Center catching the two buildings in the act, as a reference to Modernity. Her largest artwork was a mural (1987‚Äì2015) on the stage tower of the Netherlands Dance Theatre in The Hague, however in 2015 the building and the mural was demolished. \\"The World of Madelon Vriesendorp: Paintings/Postcards/Objects/Games\\" was a 40-year retrospective exhibition of the artist's career, curated by Shumon Basar and Stephan Tr√ºby.

It was accompanied by a richly illustrated catalogue, and had contributions from Beatriz Colomina, Douglas Coupland, Hubert Damisch, Teri -Damisch, Zaha Hadid, Charles Jencks, Charlie Koolhaas, Hans Ulrich Obrist, Brett Steele and Fenna Haakma Wagenaar. In 2018, she was awarded the Architectural Review, Ada Louise Huxtable Prize for her contributions to the architectural industry.

The school directress is Irene Ferrer. ICA is a non-stock, non-profit elementary and secondary school owned and directed by the Missionary Sisters of the Immaculate Conception, a Canadian-founded congregation of women religious by Delia Tetreault. ICA caters to Chinese Filipino female students. ==History== ICA traces its foundation in 1933-1936 when the Chinese families in Binondo requested the MIC sisters to open a school so that their children who have been baptized in the Catholic Church could be followed up in the practice of living out of their faith. The school moved seven times to accommodate its growing population, partly due to influx of Chinese immigrants escaping the Sino-Japanese War as well as the damage of school buildings as a result of the shelling of Manila by the Americans and the Japanese during World War II. The close ties between ICA and its neighboring exclusive school for boys and co-member of the EDSA-Ortigas Consortium (EDSOR), Xavier School, that can be seen today can be traced to the 1950s. At the invitation of the Jesuits who were then building Xavier School in 1958 in the newly opened subdivision in Greenhills, the MIC Sisters also constructed a building that was completed in 1960; thus, the Sisters were ready to receive the Chinese Filipino students from ICA-Intramuros, which continued to operate the elementary department and kindergarten. In 1975, ICA- Intramuros was fused with ICA-Greenhills. At present ICA-Greenhills has a population of 3,381 with 1,009 in the high school department. Originally, ICA was considered an Anglo-Chinese school with a double curriculum (Chinese and English). In 1954, ICA became a Filipino school offering the Chinese Language Arts program as an essential part of the curriculum. While majority of the student population is Chinese Filipino, Chinese heritage is not a main criterion for admission to ICA; a majority of ICA's students have fathers, siblings and other male relatives who are studying or have matriculated in Xavier School. ICA undertook the accreditation process of Philippine Accrediting Association of Schools, Colleges and Universities or PAASCU in SY 1983-84 and received full-accredited status in 1986.

Open knowledge is a set of principles and methodologies related to the production and distribution of how knowledge works in an open manner. Knowledge is interpreted broadly to include data, content and general information. The concept is related to open source and the Open Knowledge Definition is directly derived from the Open Source Definition. Open knowledge can be seen as being a superset of open data, open content and libre open access with the aim of highlighting the commonalities between these different groups. ==HistoryEarly history=== Similarly to other 'open' concepts such as open data and open content, though the term is rather new, the concept is old. For example, one of the earliest printed texts of which we have record is a copy of the Buddhist Diamond sutra produced in China around 868 AD, and in it can be found the dedication: \\"for universal free distribution\\". ===Twentieth century=== In the early twentieth century a debate about intellectual property rights developed within the German Social Democratic Party. A key contributor was Karl Kautsky who in 1902 devoted a section of a pamphlet to \\"Intellectual Production\\" which he distinguished from material production: :\\"Communism in material production, anarchy in the intellectual that is the type of a Socialist mode of production, as it will develop from the rule of the proletariat‚Äîin other words, from the Social Revolution through the logic of economic facts, whatever might be: the wishes, intentions, and theories of the proletariat.\\" This view was based on an analysis according to which Karl Marx's Law of value only affected material production, not intellectual production. With the development of the public Internet from the early 1990s, it became far easier to copy and share information across the world. The phrase 'information wants to be free' became a rallying cry for people who wanted to create an internet without the commercial barriers that they felt inhibited creative expression in traditional material production. Wikipedia was founded in 2001 with the ethos of providing information which could be edited and modified to improve its quality. The success of Wikipedia became instrumental in making open knowledge something that millions of people interacted with and contributed to. What is open knowledge?

Digby was also appointed a commissioner of assessment for Warwickshire. He was accounted a member of the Country Party, but never took his seat, as he died on 29 December of that year.

He was a pioneer settler in Wisconsin Territory, early elected official in the state of Wisconsin and founded the first Norwegian language newspaper to be published in the United States.The Norwegians of Wisconsin (Phillips, Wisconsin Times Newspaper. April 2, 1905) ==Background== Reymert was born in Farsund, in the county of Vest-Agder, Norway. Several generations of his forefathers were in succession the pastors of the same church at the S√∏gne Parish from 1636 to 1738. His father, Christen Reymert, had been a ship owner and merchant in Leith, Scotland and later a customs officer in Farsund. His mother, Jeanette Sinclair Denoon, had been born in Scotland. At age fifteen young Reymert left home to complete a course of study at a commercial college at Christiania. Later he went to Scotland, where he entered the commercial house of John Mitchell and Company at Leith, spending four years there. He studied law and literature at Edinburgh in the law offices of Murdoek and Spencer. He was under the guardianship of his uncle, the Reverend James Young, a Presbyterian minister.James Denoon Reymert and the Norwegian Press(by Martin L. Reymert (Norwegian-American Historical Association. Volume XII: Page 79) ==Career== Reymert migrated to the United States during 1842 and in 1844 he married fellow Norwegian immigrant Anna Caspara Hensen. They settled down in the Muskego Settlement in Wisconsin. In 1847, James D. Reymert, Even Heg and S√∏ren Bache agreed to start the Norwegian-language newspaper Nordlyset (The Northern Light). Reymert continued to serve as editor the paper until 1850, when it was sold and was moved to Racine, Wisconsin. In 1852, Reymert founded the village of Denoon on the shores of Lake DeNoon. The town was built around the first two-boiler sawmill in America. The town prospered, but was abandoned following a cholera epidemic. Reynert was also credited with getting a plank road built from Janesville to Milwaukee.The Diary of S√∏ren Bache, 1839-1847 (translated and edited by C. A.

He served in 1849 as a Free Soil member of the Wisconsin State Assembly from Racine County, and as a member of the County's board of supervisors.Western Historical Company. The history of Racine and Kenosha Counties, Wisconsin Chicago: Western Historical Company, 1879; p. 315 As a Democrat, he was elected to Wisconsin State Senate from the 10th District from 1854‚Äì1855, and, again served in the Assembly from Milwaukee County's 9th Assembly district in 1857. He also served as district attorney, superintendent of schools, and served as vice-consul for Sweden and Norway. He was appointed receiver of the United States General Land Office and disbursing agent for the northwestern states as well as variety of other public positions. Reymert held public office in Wisconsin until 1860. Through an acquaintance with Stephen A. Douglas, Reymert became a nominee for Wisconsin's 2nd congressional district in 1860 on the Democratic ticket, but lost to Luther Hanchett.Reymert, James De Noon 1821‚Äì1896 (Dictionary of Wisconsin History. Wisconsin Historic Society) == After Wisconsin == In 1861, Reymert opened a law office in New York City and shortly afterward organized Hercules Mutual Life Assurance Society. Because of failing health in 1873, he relocated for a time to a farm on the Bio-Bio River near Mulchen, Chile. He returned to the United States, arriving in San Francisco in 1876. He had been contacted by former Wisconsin governor, Coles Bashford who had been appointed to political office in the Arizona Territory. Reymert subsequently relocated to Pinal County. Here he organized the Reymert Silver Mines, built a mining and smelting operation and established the mining towns of DeNoon and Reymert, Arizona. Reymert published the weekly Pinal Drill, and at the same time he was also practiced law. James Denoon Reymert died in the spring of 1896 in Alhambra, California.James Denoon Reymert (The Phrenological Journal and Life Illustrated. February 1872, Volume LIV, No. 2.

Developed and produced by Ranald Graham, the series was loosely based on the novels by William Leonard Marshall. A single season of thirteen episodes was produced by Yorkshire Television and broadcast on ITV from January 13th to April 7th, 1990. The series starred Ray Lonnen as principal character Alex Vale, with Bruce Payne, Robert Taylor, Doreen Chan, Tzi Ma, Mark McGann and Catherine Neilson also appearing as detectives in the series. The series was well received by viewers and critics alike, despite only lasting one season. However, the series also received negative press, with Matters Criminous stating that \\"The series chiefest goal seemed to have been to explore just how very badly a dramatisation can corrupt and befoul the ideas and characters of a book.\\" The series was also celebrated for the use of state-of-the-art technology involved with the production, including becoming one of the first series on British television with stereo sound.http://www.impactonline.co/television/1755-yellowthread-street- revisited/ The Daily Mail claimed that at the time of broadcast, the series' cult following led to an unexpected wave of purchases of hi-fi stereo speakers. Notably, the series has never been released on D.V.D. ==Novels== In the Yellowthread Street novels, the detectives of the Yellowthread Street police station are based in the fictitious Hong Bay, Hong Kong. Four principal characters are featured in the novels; DCI Harry Feiffer, of European heritage but third generation born and brought up in the Colony, Senior Inspector Christopher O'Yee, a half-Chinese American and the ever-bickering team of Inspectors Auden and Spencer, who attempt to find the rational basis for inexplicable and seemingly bizarre crimes. One of the most notable novels is 1988's Out of Nowhere, in which Feiffer must figure out why in the pre-dawn hours, four people in a plate-glass-filled van with Chinese opera blaring out of the tape deck were driving on the wrong side of a deserted motorway, miles from the nearest on-ramp, before dying in a violent collision with an oncoming lorry. Sixteen novels were published between 1975 and 1998: Yellowthread Street (1975), The Hatchet Man (1976), Gelignite (1976), Thin Air (1977), Skulduggery (1979), Sci-Fi (1981), Perfect End (1981), War Machine (1982), The Far Away Man (1984), Roadshow (1985), Head First (1986), Frogmouth (1987), Out of Nowhere (1988), Inches (1994), Nightmare Syndrome (1997) and To The End (1998). ==Cast== * Ray Lonnen as Chief Inspector Alex Vale * Doreen Chan as Detective Jackie Wu * Bruce Payne as Detective Nick Eden * Robert Taylor as Detective Peter Marenta * Tzi Ma as Detective Eddie Pak * Mark McGann as Detective CJ Brady * Catherine Neilson as Detective Kelly Lang Recurring Cast * Kenny Chan as Detective Chan * Diego Swing as Frankie Ku * Ming-Yang Li as Blind Beggar * Christopher Leung as Szi Tai * Winnie Tang as Jei ==Episodes== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"width:100%;\\" - style=\\"color:#fff;\\" ! 87319F;\\" Episode ! 87319F;\\" Title ! 87319F;\\" Written by ! 87319F;\\" Directed by ! 87319F;\\" Original airdate } ==References== ==External links== * Category:1990s British drama television series Category:1990 British television series debuts Category:1990 British television series endings Category:British crime television series Category:ITV television dramas Category:Television shows based on Australian novels Category:1990s British television miniseries Category:Television series by ITV Studios Category:Television series by Yorkshire Television Category:English-language television shows Category:Television shows set in Hong Kong ","title":"Yellowthread Street"},{"id":"9106948","text":"Petras Klimas Petras Klimas (, February 23, 1891 - January 16, 1969) was a Lithuanian diplomat, author, historian, and one of the twenty signatories of the Act of Independence of Lithuania.

The house was constructed in several phases during the 18th century and completed in circa 1780. The palace is designed in the Baroque style, although its ornamentation is of a more severe form In respect of what is generally accepted as Sicilian Baroque. The tall windows of the piano nobile are decorated with alternating pointed and segmented pediments, while the windows of the lower and upper floors are much smaller, almost cell like, indicating a more modest function of the rooms they belong. In this way the architecture could be said to be more Renaissance than Baroque. In 1750 the interior was created in true Sicilian Baroque style by Marianna Valguarnera, with special furniture in the very ornate style, created by local craftsmen. The creation of the house took so long that the Baroque style passed out of fashion in favour of the neoclassical style, and it was during this era that the large circular and domed dining room was created with its painted panels on the dome by Giuseppe Velasco. In 1963 the palazzo, and most memorably its ballroom, were the setting for Luchino Visconti's film' Il Gattopardo (The Leopard). Today, while the famous ballroom may be hired for events, the rest of the house is still used as a private residence. == References == * Category:Baroque architecture in Palermo Category:Palaces in Palermo Category:Houses completed in 1780 ","title":"Palazzo Valguarnera-Gangi"},{"id":"9107056","text":"Yevgeny Primakov's Cabinet (September 11, 1998, - May 12, 1999) was the seventh cabinet of government of the Russian Federation, preceded by Sergei Kiriyenko's Cabinet fallen as a result of the 1998 Russian financial crisis and followed by Sergei Stepashin's Cabinet. It was led by Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, proposed by President Boris Yeltsin on September 10, 1998, as Viktor Chernomyrdin had failed to be approved by the State Duma twice by September 7 (August 31: 94 in favor, 252 against, nobody abstained, September 7: 138 in favor, 273 against, 1 abstained) ; According to the Constitution of Russia, if parliament rejects the president's nomination three times, then parliament must be dissolved and a general election held. On September 11 Primakov was approved by the Duma as Prime Minister (317 in favor, 63 against, 15 abstained) and appointed Prime Minister by the President. In the State Duma only Vladimir Zhirinovsky's Liberal Democratic Party of Russia was both in favor of Chernomyrdin and against Primakov. Fourteen ministers of the government out of thirty-one held positions in the previous cabinet: Primakov (Minister for External Affairs), Maslyukov (Minister of Industry and Trade), Bulgak (Minister of Science and Technology), Adamov, Stepashin, Gazizullin, Shoigu, Sergeyev, Aksyonenko, Semyonov, Generalov, Frank, Zadornov, Krasheninnikov (the same positions). According to the Russian legislation, the ministers were appointed by the President. On May 12, 1999 Yeltsin sacked the government and Prime Minister and claimed that Primakov had failed to improve the economy after the 1998 Russian financial crisis. By then Primakov had become the most popular Russian politician. The real reason of the government reshuffle was considered linked to the upcoming start of impeachment hearings against Yeltsin in the State Duma (Primakov refused to fire ministers belonging to the Communist Party). ==Ministers== { align=\\"left\\" border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"6\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"margin: 0 0 0 1em; background: #ffffff; border: 1px #aaaaaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; text-align:left; font- size: 95%;\\" -

Oplan Paglalanse is an adventure story arc of the Philippine comic strip series Pugad Baboy, created by Pol Medina Jr. and originally published in the Philippine Daily Inquirer. This particular story arc lasts 23 strips long and ran in during the month of January 1994. In 1996, the story arc was reprinted in Pugad Baboy 7, the seventh book compilation of the comic strip series. This marks the first appearance of the Walang Payat Gang, a vigilante group formed by Utoy, Paltik, Joma, and Polgas. The Walang Payat Gang again makes an appearance in a later story arc, Kulto. ==Synopsis== The officers at the Left Turn Police District's inflow of bribes are slowing down as many motorists are beginning to obey traffic rules. Patrolman Gagancho tells his colleague Patrolman Durugas that it is just the Filipino trait of ningas cogon because abiding the law may be one of the motorists' New Year's resolutions and they may later revert to their old ways. The district chief Colonel Magti then launches Oplan Paglalanse to make sure the motorists will. Oplan Paglalanse is done as follows: Traffic lights are reprogrammed so the yellow light will not light up. One-way and two-way streets are reassigned. Parking and No Parking zones are redesignated, and so are tow-away zones. Fees in the use of pay parking areas are also hiked. All of this are done without any notice to the motorists to confuse them. This will be implemented for three months, after which when the motorists get used to the new rules, the rules are changed again. The new \\"project\\" pays off as bribe collection is on the rise again. To add insult to injury to the motorists, Colonel Magti even tells his men that rather than buying more tow trucks, they will use wheel boots so the vehicles to be towed will not go anywhere while the tow trucks are busy. However, the district officers are beginning to be victims of their own scheme. ===Payback=== One day, Patrolman Gagancho parks his jeep in front of a fire hydrant, which is not allowed. While his back is turned, his jeep is towed away to a place called Radium in the suburb of San Andres Bukid. When the tow truck leaves the jeep there, some scrupulous men take the jeep apart, leaving only its chassis. Meanwhile, Patrolman Oonse drives the wrong way in a one-way street when he feels his jeep's tires have been punctured. He stops to see iron spikes on his jeep's path. He leaves the jeep to call for help, but when he returns, he is surprised to see wheel boots installed on his jeep's tires. In another part of town, Patrolman Durugas is driving home drunk with his car sirens on. In fact, he is so drunk that he is not paying attention to any traffic light or intersection. From a vehicle driving behind the officer's car, a shadow (Polgas) shoots a taser pistol to the officer's car. The car's body is negatively charged, so when the positively charged taser goes into contact with the car, it electrocutes the car (driver and all) and short- circuits its electrical system in the process. The three affected police officers report to the station to air what happened to Colonel Magti only to find out the colonel is not spared as his family car and those of his wife and eight children have been towed and impounded in several different stations. The culprit also leaves him a note, which tells him that everybody must follow the law; and that includes law \\"enforcers.\\" Infuriated by the note, Colonel Magti orders his men to find and \\"arrange\\" the note's author, known only as \\"WPG.\\" One day, Patrolman Gagancho once again parks his new jeep in front of a fire hydrant and stakes out the location. Not long after, a pick-up truck laden with \\"balikbayan boxes\\" (large boxes used by Filipino migrants to send and/or bring gifts to loved ones) passes by. Patrolman Gagancho immediately apprehends the truck and talks to its driver. While he is thinking of what violation he can charge to the driver, the policeman does not sense his new jeep is being towed away. He finally proceeds to unload one box from the truck, charging the driver with overloading. But as he turns his back, he finds his jeep gone, and when he turns again, the truck has also driven off, leaving the boxes behind. When he opens the boxes, he finds, to his horror, garbage from Malaca√±an Palace inside. The trickery played against the Left Turn police officers go on with success until Patrolman Durugas catches a boy (Paltik) installing wheel boots on his jeep. He starts shooting at the boy (without warning) as another (Utoy) uses a specialized Swiss army knife to shoot a capsule of liquid nitrogen on Durugas' hand. The policeman's hand is suddenly frozen to his gun. The confrontation then takes place between Durugas and a group known as \\"WPG\\" or \\"Walang Payat Gang\\" (walang payat is Filipino for \\"none thin\\") composed only of four members: Polgas, Utoy, Paltik, and Joma. However, only a question and an introduction are exchanged in that encounter. Patrolman Durugas reports the matter to Colonel Magti, but since the colonel is \\"busy\\" reading a newspaper, he tells the patrolman to file his report. So Durugas, still with his right hand frozen in liquid nitrogen, types an action-packed, yet fictitious account of the encounter, hoping a movie producer will be interested in his life story. ===The Bust=== Days later, Colonel Magti calls his men to tell them of his plan to catch the WPG. Currently, their bribes are collected by jeepney barkers, dispatchers, and cigarette vendors. So the colonel sets up his plan: an honesty lane wherein the motorist will just throw money into a drum just to use the lane. The colonel is sure the WPG will confiscate the drum so Patrolman Gagancho is tasked to hide inside the drum so he can arrest the group on the spot. So the honesty lane plan goes underway. Four days later, the WPG takes the drum away to Smokey Mountain, a garbage dump in suburban Manila. The group intends to donate the money inside to the child scavengers there. But as the group is about to give the drum of coins, Patrolman Gagancho comes out from inside the drum and takes a child hostage, forcing the WPG to surrender. Colonel Magti, along with Patrolmen Oonse and Durugas, come to Gagancho's aid and confiscate several items from the group. Unknown to them, Utoy is still holding his Swiss army knife while his arms are still raised. He then shoots out a capsule of sodium to a spot near the base of the drum, igniting the garbage there. As Oonse is about to take Utoy's Swiss army knife, the coins and the drum become so hot Gagancho shoots out of the drum. Suddenly, \\"in one fluid motion,\\" the WPG attacks the three other police officers. Even the child scavengers join in the act with one of them hitting Patrolman Oonse with a car battery. It doesn't take long before Paltik and Utoy subdue Colonel Magti with a scissor lock. Utoy even opens the colonel's face mask to let him smell the stench of the dump. The colonel hangs tough, but after eight seconds, he finally confesses to heading the anomalous \\"Oplan Paglalanse.\\" The confession is even recorded on tape by Joma. Polgas then shows the police officers the tape which contains the confession and all the activities involved in Oplan Paglalanse and he tells the colonel that he will make copies of it and the group will expose Oplan Paglalanse if the officers keep up with the anomalous acts. Colonel Magti asks if the group will show the video to the Senate; Polgas answers that he won't because Senate inquiries don't get resolved anyway. Instead, he will show it to several media outlets, columnists, the Alex Boncayao Brigade, and even the writers of the TV show Abangan... ang Susunod na Kabanata. So the officers promise to stop Oplan Paglalanse and do their jobs. Indeed, the officers of Left Turn Police District keep their promise to reform themselves. Even Dagul, one of Patrolman Durugas' \\"victims\\" is surprised to see the officer reminding him to buckle his seatbelt instead of asking for bribes. Truly, the police officers have become good, hardworking, and responsible law enforcers. The only thing still troubling Colonel Magti is how he will support his four wives and eighteen children. ==Story teaser== When the arc was published in Pugad Baboy 7, this line about the arc is found in the back. It goes as follows: Gluttony, greed, sloth... You name it, they're guilty of it. They're the country's most sinful. And they're on the right side of the law. Under the lines, the WPG is shown facing away from the reader toward the colonel and the three officers. However, there is an error: when the group is pictured to have five members when it is clear that there are four. The reader can deduce that the mystery fifth member may be either an unlikely Bong, who never appears in the arc at all but will become a victim himself of another money laundering case the WPG investigate two books later (in Kulto) or a doppelganger for either Utoy or Paltik and Medina may just added him for symmetry in the group's formation. ==Character information== The name of Patrolman Durugas, already a recurring character in the strip, is derived from the word mandurugas (one who cheats). So it is appropriate that his fellow officers Patrolmen Gagancho and Oonse's names are also derived from Filipino slang words associated with cheating and fraud (mang-oonse and mangagantso). Colonel Magti is based on Magtanggol Gunigundo, who was chairman of the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority at the time the arc was first published.

It was a founding member of the Cambridge Theological Federation, an ecumenical body of theological colleges in Cambridge which is affiliated to but independent of the University of Cambridge. ==History== The college was founded and endowed by Michael Gutteridge, a Methodist businessman in Naples, well known in Italy for philanthropy.

The full range is -0.5 through just less than +7.5. Negative numbers enables scRGB to encompass most of the CIE 1931 color space while maintaining simplicity and backward compatibility with sRGB without the complexity of color management. The cost of maintaining compatibility with sRGB is that approximately 80% of the scRGB color space consists of imaginary colors. Large positive numbers allow high dynamic range images to be represented, though the range is inferior to that of some other high dynamic range formats such as OpenEXR.\\"High Dynamic Range Image Encodings\\". Greg Ward. Retrieved 2010-10-25. == Encoding == Two encodings are defined for the individual primaries: a linear 16 bit per channel encoding and a nonlinear 12 bit per channel encoding. The 16 bit scRGB(16) encoding is the linear RGB channels converted by 8192 x + 4096. Compared to 8-bit sRGB this ranges from almost 2¬Ω times the color resolution near 0.0 to more than 14 times the color resolution near 1.0. Storage as 16 bits clamps the linear range to -0.5 .. 7.4999. The 12-bit scRGB-nl encoding is the linear RGB channels passed through the same opto- electric conversion function as sRGB (for negative numbers use -f(-x)) and then converted by 1280 x + 1024. This is exactly 5 times the color resolution of 8-bit sRGB, and 8-bit sRGB can be converted directly with 5 x + 1024. The linear range is clamped to the slightly larger -0.6038 .. 7.5913 A 12-bit encoding called scYCC-nl is the conversion of the non-linear sRGB levels to JFIF-Y'CbCr and then converted by 1280 Y' + 1024 and 1280 Cx + 2048. This form can allow greater compression and direct conversion to/from JPEG files and video hardware. With the addition of an alpha channel with the same number of bits the 16-bit encoding may be seen referred to as 64 bit and the 12-bit encoding referred to as 48-bit. Alpha is not encoded as above, however. Alpha is instead a linear 0-1 range multiplied by 2^n-1 where n is 12 or 16. == Usage == The first implementation of scRGB was the GDI+ API in Windows Vista. At WinHEC 2008 Microsoft announced that Windows 7 would support 48-bit scRGB (which for HDMI can be converted and output as xvYCC). The components in Windows 7 that support 48-bit scRGB are Direct3D, the Windows Imaging Component, and the Windows Color System and they support it in both full screen exclusive mode and in video overlays. == Origin of sc in scRGB == The origin of the sc in scRGB is shrouded in mystery. Officially it stands for nothing. According to Michael Stokes (the national and international leader of the International Electrotechnical Commission, or IEC, group working on scRGB), the name appeared when the Japanese national committee requested a name change from the earlier XsRGB (excess RGB). The two leading candidates for meaning are ‚Äúspecular RGB‚Äù because scRGB supports whites greater than the diffuse 1.0 values, and ‚Äústandard compositing RGB‚Äù because the linearity, floating-point support, HDR (high dynamic range) support, and wide gamut support are ideally suited for compositing. This meaning also implicitly emphasizes that scRGB is not intended to be directly supported in devices or formats, since by definition scRGB encompasses values that are beyond both the human visual system and (even theoretically) realizable physical devices.Essential Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), by Chris Anderson, p.227 == References == == External links == * The standard IEC 61966-2-2 * Annex B: Non-linear encoding for scRGB : scRGB-nl * A working draft of IEC 61966-2-2 is available online. * PCMag.com: Defining scRGB Category:Color space Category:High dynamic range ","title":"ScRGB"},{"id":"9107165","text":"VasiliaGorochov (1988) In Medvedev, LN & Striganova [Ed.] Fauna i ekologiya nasekomykh Vetnama [The fauna and ecology of insects of Vietnam] 11 is an Asian genus of crickets in the tribe Landrevini.

The hospital is managed by the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust. ==History== The hospital opened in 1920. The United States Army constructed nissen huts on the site during the Second World War to create a temporary base for soldiers preparing to take part in the Normandy Landings. The hospital has played its part in the history of The Troubles. On 15 December 1980, Sean McKenna, one of the original seven hunger strikers was moved to Musgrave Park Hospital. On 2 November 1991, a bomb planted by the Provisional IRA exploded in the Military Wing at Musgrave Park hospital. Two soldiers were killed (one Royal Army Medical Corps, named Phil Cross, the other Royal Corps of Transport, named Craig Pantry) and 11 other people were injured, among them a five-year-old girl and a baby of four months.

Cavendish-Bentinck and Ruth Cavendish-Bentinck, grandson of George Cavendish-Bentinck, and great-grandson of Major General Lord Frederick Cavendish-Bentinck, fourth son of the 3rd Duke of Portland, the young Cavendish-Bentinck was educated at Eton and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, passing out in 1910. He was commissioned into the 60th Rifles and was posted to Malta and British India before seeing active service in the European theatre of the First World War, which left him severely wounded. He then took up a posting as assistant adjutant at the Royal Military College. After the war, his main sphere of activity was in East Africa, where he served as Private Secretary to the Governor of Uganda (1925‚Äì1927), Chairman of the Agricultural Production and Settlement Board for Kenya (1939‚Äì1945), Timber Controller for East Africa (1940‚Äì1945), Member of the Government of Kenya for Agriculture and Natural Resources (1945‚Äì1955), and Speaker of the Kenya Legislative Council (1955‚Äì1960).\\"Portland, 8th Duke of\\" in Who Was Who (A. & C. Black) He was a Delegate to the Delhi Conference of 1940. He became the heir presumptive of his third cousin, William Cavendish-Bentinck, 7th Duke of Portland, after the deaths of the latter's brother Lord (Francis) Morven Dallas Cavendish-Bentinck (1900-1950) and half-uncle Charles Cavendish- Bentinck (1868-1956). The previous duke's lands came to stay with the descendants of the 7th Duke and never passed to the distantly related 8th Duke in 1977. In the early 20th century the usual tail male arrangement of the entailed largest landholdings became deprecated by powerful statutes as it tended to leave noble daughters with little. The 6th Duke, before dying in 1943 broke the entails and set up a trust which saw as his son the future 7th Duke left no son Welbeck Abbey and other large holdings would go to his granddaughters in turn including Lady Anne Cavendish-Bentinck. No viable family court case could ensue as the fee tail was abolished as a recognised entity in the abstract (in law) under the Law of Property Act 1925 and any remote, entailed beneficiaries could be disinherited under the Settled Land Acts. The new Duke of Portland continued to live in Nairobi. Elizabeth II shares an ancestor, in the 3rd Duke of Portland, through her maternal grandmother Cecilia Cavendish-Bentinck, and is thus a third cousin, once removed, of the 8th Duke of Portland. ==Family == In 1912, he married Wentworth Frances (d 1964), daughter of William James Hope-Johnston. They divorced in 1950 without issue. In 1950, he married Gwyneth Ethel (d 1986), daughter of John Lesley Edwards and widow of Colonel David A.J. Bowie. Again, this marriage produced no issue.

Digby was a younger son of Kildare Digby, 2nd Baron Digby, and Mary Gardiner. He was privately educated by a clergyman, William Rawlins, at the family estate of Coleshill, Warwickshire, before matriculating on 1 July 1674 at Magdalen College, Oxford. He was admitted to Lincoln's Inn in 1676, and succeeded his elder brother, Robert, as Baron Digby in December 1677. At the October 1679 election, Digby stood as a court candidate for Coventry, but was outpolled by all the other candidates. From 1679 to 1680, he was a commissioner of assessment for Warwickshire, and a deputy lieutenant of the county from 1680 on. A devout and scrupulous man (he rarely gambled, and donated any winnings to the poor), he took particular pains in exercising the advowson of Coleshill. He ultimately appointed John Kettlewell, then known as the author of The Measures of Christian Obedience, to the vicariate there in December 1682. On 27 August 1683, he married Lady Frances Noel, daughter of Edward Noel, 1st Earl of Gainsborough, and Lady Elizabeth Wriothesley (herself daughter of Thomas Wriothesley, 4th Earl of Southampton). They had one daughter; Lady Digby died in childbirth, and was buried at Coleshill on 4 October. *Hon. Frances Digby (29 September 1684 ‚Äì 3 May 1729), married James Scudamore, 3rd Viscount Scudamore, and had one daughter. At the 1685 election, he was returned as Member of Parliament for Warwick, presumably, like his elder brother, with the support of Lord Brooke. He was quite active in Parliament, serving on several committees, and was so strenuous and effective a speaker against a standing army as to be numbered among the opposition, and named to the committee which wrote the address against employing Roman Catholic officers. However, this activity was not long to continue: Digby died on 19 January 1685/6 at Coleshill, and was buried there. Kettlewell preached his funeral sermon, as he had for Lady Digby.

Incidents  On August 23, 1987, N93012 was caught by crosswinds during a landing at Beaver County Airport near Pittsburgh. Landing too far down the runway, the plane rolled off the end of runway, crashed through a fence and power pole, and came to rest down a ravine. Landing gear, chin and ball turrets, bomb bay doors, Plexiglass nose, nacelles, wings, and fuselage all sustained damage. There were no fatalities, however three of the twelve people on board were injured. Repair work by volunteers and Air Heritage Aircraft Restoration Inc., supported by donations, brought N93012 back to airworthy condition. On July 9, 1995, N93012 was again damaged, this time near Norfolk, Nebraska, when her landing gear would not fully deploy and she was forced to make an emergency landing, causing some damage to the fuselage and at least one propeller.

The console typically displays reports, charts, and graphs of that information, often in real time. Some software agents can incorporate local filters to reduce and manipulate the data that they send to the server, although typically from a forensic point of view you would collect all audit and accounting logs to ensure you can recreate a security incident. The security console is monitored by an administrator who reviews the consolidated information and takes action in response to any alerts issued. The data that is sent to the server to be correlated and analyzed are normalized by the software agents into a common form, usually XML. Those data are then aggregated in order to reduce their overall size. ==Terminology== The terminology can easily be mistaken as a reference to the whole aspect of protecting one's infrastructure from any computer security breach. Due to historic reasons of terminology evolution; SIM refers to just the part of information security which consists of discovery of 'bad behavior' by using data collection techniques. The term commonly used to represent an entire security infrastructure that protects an environment is commonly called information security management (InfoSec).

The current structure built in 1874 as the Church of the Ascension was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. In the late 1940s, the Church of the Ascension merged with the nearby St. Agnes Episcopal Church and adopted its present name, under which it has continued as an active parish in the Episcopal Diocese of Washington.Episcopal Diocese of Washington: Find a church ==History== On May 7, 1844, several residents of northwest Washington who had previously attended services at St. John's Episcopal Church in the Lafayette Square neighborhood met to begin forming their own parish. The church was formally established March 1, 1845, and the territory of St. John's was split between the two churches. While the church raised funds to construct a building, the members met in a schoolhouse on 9th Street. Parishioner Martha Burnes was the owner of 600 acres of Washington real estate, which she had inherited. In 1802, she married John Peter Van Ness, who was a prominent banker and later became Mayor of Washington. Among Mrs. Van Ness's philanthropic endeavors was the Washington Orphan Asylum, which she established and supervised. Mrs. Van Ness expressed a desire to help the building effort, but died before this could happen. In accordance with her wishes, Mr. Van Ness donated land on H Street NW between 9th and 10th to Ascension Parish, and the cornerstone was laid September 5, 1844. The Gothic Revival brick structure was complete enough to use by December 1844, and the first services were held December 14. The debt the parish incurred for construction was repaid by 1853, and the church was consecrated May 23 of that year. Throughout the 1850s, however, the parish continued to experience difficulties, which included the ill health of its rector, Levin I. Gilliss, resignation of his successor, a decline in the number of communicants and Sunday school attendees, and continued financial problems. The congregation sought the Rev. William Pinkney, who was then rector of St. Matthias Church in nearby Bladensburg, Maryland, to become the next rector. After initial reluctance, Pinkney agreed and the parish stabilized. In 1859, he oversaw building renovations that included expanding the capacity for approximately 600 additional worshipers. As many parishioners had friends and relatives in both the Northern and Southern states, their feelings and loyalties boiled over in the church during the period leading to and during the Civil War. This division was evident in the clerical ranks also as the rector, Mr Pinkney, sympathized with the South while Maryland Bishop William Whittingham was a Unionist. In March 1862, Bishop Whittingham requested parishes to say a special prayer of thanksgiving for the late (Union) victories; Mr. Pinkney refused. The Saturday following Pinkney's refusal, Washington's Provost Marshall notified him that the authories would assume control of the church to prevent a disturbance. Ascension became a military hospital to house casualties from the Peninsula Campaign, as did Epiphany Church and Holy Trinity in Washington. After their church was seized by the government, the parish was without a home. The problem was solved by member William Corcoran, a prominent banker and partner in the firm of Corcoran and Riggs, later known as Riggs Bank. Corcoran offered the use of a building he owned on H Street NW between 13th and 14th Streets. The congregation returned to its permanent home after the war, but by 1870, the structure proved too small and not grand enough for what was now one of the most affluent areas of the city. After much debate, leaders decided to erect a new structure and began soliciting funds. William Corcoran donated a site at the northwest corner of Massachusetts Avenue and 12th Street and $100,000 of the $205,000 construction costs. The congregation engaged the Baltimore firm of Dixon and Carson, and the cornerstone was laid June 9, 1874. The new building was constructed of white marble quarried near Cockeysville, Maryland with accents of pink Ohio sandstone. Designed in the Victorian Gothic style, it reached a height of with a tower and spire that was visible across much of the city. The interior featured cast iron columns and timber trusses and was illuminated by gas lamps. Despite the gift of William Corcoran, the church continued to have financial problems and by 1877 was facing the possibility of dissolution. After a plea to its members, the church was able to raise needed funds and received a challenge gift of $10,000 from Corcoran. The construction debt was finally retired in 1885. In 1895, the Diocese of Washington was created from the Diocese of Maryland and included the District of Columbia and Charles, Montgomery, Prince George's, and St. Mary's Counties in Maryland. St. Mark's Church was chosen as the cathedral in 1896. In 1902, Annunciation assumed that role until 1908 when the parish leaders voted to terminate the relationship with the diocese. Although the official designation ceased, the church continued to be used as the pro-cathedral for important occasions until 1912 while the Washington National Cathedral was under construction. After World War I, membership began to decline, and in 1925 the congregation merged with nearby St. Stephen's to help stabilize the group. This worked briefly until the onset of the Great Depression. This downturn continued through 1947, and the diocese considered selling the building to another congregation when the Vestry received a proposal to merge from St. Agnes Church. The interior was redecorated and a mural was added above the chancel. The nave windows and window above the organ gallery were replaced between 1965 and 1975 with faceted glass and epoxy designs created by the Willet Studios of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Today, the church offers worship services, concerts, and a number of outreach groups for members and nearby residents. ==The parish== The current parish is a diverse, urban congregation from both the downtown area and the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area. Some parishioners come from Baltimore, Annapolis, and Richmond. It has a 20s and 30s group, including students from nearby Virginia Theological Seminary, who also attend services there. ===Services=== The main Sunday service is Solemn Mass and sermon with choir and organ, at 10:30 am. Sunday low mass is at 8:00 a.m. Between the two services, adult education and the Rosary are offered at 9:00 am. During the week, Evening Prayer and Low Mass are offered on Wednesdays at 6:40 pm and Eucharistic adoration and Low Mass are offered on Thursdays beginning at 6:30 am.Church of the Ascension and Saint Agnes ===Ministries=== The ministries of the parish include the following: *Community Groups: Ascension and St. Agnes has two weekly community groups where individuals from the parish and outside come together for a meal and conversation. *Alpha Course: Alpha Course is a ten-week course introducing the basics of Christianity. Designed for both non- believers and those who would simply like to refresh their faith, it has been taken by some eleven million people worldwide. *Catechumenate: Catechumenate is the course of preparation used by the church since the 4th century to prepare new Christians for baptism. The course runs from October through April and serves as instruction for those wishing to be baptized, confirmed or received into the Episcopal Church. *Theology Book Club: A monthly group which studies and discusses various theological works. *Benedictine cell: Serves as a group to engage those wishing to explore monastic spirituality. *Bible Study: Bible study is held Sunday mornings at 9:00 a.m. * Outreach programs: The Parish helps subsidize Christ House, a hospital for the inner city poor and homeless. Christ House is a United Way charity. The parish also participates in the mission of N Street Village, which offers programs for homeless women and low-income families. In addition, Ascension and St. Agnes runs an annual mission trip to San Juan de Oriente, Nicaragua. ==See also== * Paul Callaway ==References== ==External links== *Church of the Ascension and St Agnes *Christ House *List of Anglo-Catholic Devotional Societies * Mystery Worshiper's report Category:Episcopal churches in Washington, D.C.

Gallstones may develop in the gallbladder as well as elsewhere in the biliary tract. If gallstones in the gallbladder are symptomatic, surgical removal of the gallbladder, known as cholecystectomy may be indicated. Gallstones form when the tenuous balance of solubility of biliary lipids tips in favor of precipitation of cholesterol, unconjugated bilirubin, or bacterial degradation products of biliary lipids. For cholesterol gallstones, metabolic alterations in hepatic cholesterol secretion combine with changes in gallbladder motility and intestinal bacterial degradation of bile salts to destabilize cholesterol carriers in bile and produce cholesterol crystals. For black pigment gallstones, changes in heme metabolism or bilirubin absorption lead to increased bilirubin concentrations and precipitation of calcium bilirubinate. In contrast, mechanical obstruction of the biliary tract is the major factor leading to bacterial degradation and precipitation of biliary lipids in brown pigment stones. About 104 million new cases of gallbladder and biliary disease occurred in 2013. ==Risk factors Pregnancy === During pregnancy when female sex hormones are naturally raised, biliary sludge (particulate material derived from bile that is composed of cholesterol, calcium bilirubinate, and mucin) appears in 5% to 30% of women. Resolution frequently transpires during the post-partum period: sludge disappears in two-thirds; small (<1 cm) gallstones (microlithiasis) vanish in one-third, but definitive gallstones become established in ~5%. Additional risk factors for stone formation during pregnancy include obesity (prior to the pregnancy), reduced high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and the metabolic syndrome. ===Hormonal contraceptives === Women are almost twice as likely as men to form gallstones especially during the fertile years; the gap narrows after the menopause. The underlying mechanism is female sex hormones; parity, oral contraceptive use and estrogen replacement therapy are established risk factors for cholesterol gallstone formation. Female sex hormones adversely influence hepatic bile secretion and gallbladder function. Estrogens increase cholesterol secretion and diminish bile salt secretion, while progestins act by reducing bile salt secretion and impairing gallbladder emptying leading to stasis. A new 4th generation progestin, drospirenone, used in some oral contraceptives may further heighten the risk of gallstone disease and cholecystectomy; however, the increased risk is quite modest and not likely to be clinically meaningful. A retrospective (historical) cohort study was performed on a very large data base including 1980 and 1981 Medicaid billing data from the states of Michigan and Minnesota in which 138,943 users of OCs were compared with 341,478 nonusers. Oral contraceptives were shown as risk factors for gallbladder disease, although the risk is of sufficient magnitude to be of potential clinical importance only in young women. The 1984 Royal College of General Practitioners' Oral Contraception Study suggests that, in the long-term, oral contraceptives are not associated with any increased risk of gallbladder disease, although there is an acceleration of the disease in those women susceptible to it. Newer research suggests otherwise. A 1993 meta-analysis concludes that oral contraceptive use is associated with a slightly and transiently increased rate of gallbladder disease, but laters confirms that modern low-dose oral contraceptives are safer than older formulas, though an effect cannot be excluded. A 2001 comparative study of the IMS LifeLink Health Plan Claims Database interpreted that in a large cohort of women using oral contraceptives, there was found a small, statistically significant increase in the risk of gallbladder disease associated with desogestrel, drospirenone and norethisterone compared with levonorgestrel. No statistically significant increase in risk was associated with the other formulations of oral contraceptive (etynodiol diacetate, norgestrel and norgestimate). === Menopausal hormone therapy === While some observational studies had suggested that estrogens increase the risk for gallbladder disease by as much as twofold to fourfold, such an association had not been reported consistently. More recent randomized clinical trial data among postmenopausal women now support a causal role for oral menopausal hormone therapy estrogens. Confirming the positive finding of another large study, the landmark Women's Health Initiative (WHI) reported very significant increases (p < 0.001) for risk of gallbladder disease or surgery attributed to treatments with both estrogen alone (conjugated equine estrogen; CEE) and estrogen-plus-progestin (conjugated equine estrogen with medroxyprogesterone; CEE+MPA ). Specifically, a 67% increase (CEE versus placebo) and 59% increase (CEE+MPA versus placebo) among healthy postmenopausal women that reported either having had a hysterectomy (n = 8376) or not (n = 14203) prior to randomization, respectively. === Other factors === A prospective study in 1994 noted that body mass index remains the strongest predictor of symptomatic gallstones among young women. Other risk factors are having over four pregnancies, weight gain, and cigarette smoking. Alcohol was shown to have an inverse relationship between use and gallbladder disease. == Xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis == Xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis is a rare form of gallbladder disease which mimics gallbladder cancer although it is not cancerous. It was first discovered and reported in the medical literature in 1976 by J.J. McCoy, Jr., and colleagues. ==See also== *Gallbladder polyp ==References== == External links == *Gallstones - Topic Overview *Cholecystectomy: Surgical Removal of the Gallbladder *Surgery Questions on gallbladder Category:Gallbladder disorders ","title":"Gallbladder disease"},{"id":"9107331","text":"In a distributed system, failure transparency refers to the extent to which errors and subsequent recoveries of hosts and services within the system are invisible to users and applications. For example, if a server fails, but users are automatically redirected to another server and never notice the failure, the system is said to exhibit high failure transparency. Failure transparency is one of the most difficult types of transparency to achieve since it is often difficult to determine whether a server has actually failed, or whether it is simply responding very slowly.Tanenbaum, Andrew S. and Maarten van Steen, Distributed Systems: Principles and Paradigms, Prentice Hall, Second Edition, 2007. Additionally, it is generally impossible to achieve full failure transparency in a distributed system since networks are unreliable. There is also usually a trade-off between achieving a high level of failure transparency and maintaining an adequate level of system performance. For example, if a distributed system attempts to mask a transient server failure by having the client try to contact the failed server multiple times, performance of the system may be negatively affected. In this case, it would have been preferable to have given up earlier and tried another server. == References == ==See also== *Byzantine fault tolerance *Intrusion Tolerance *Capillary routing *Cluster (computing) *Data redundancy *Elegant degradation *Error detection and correction *Fail-safe *Fault-tolerant design *Fault- tolerant system *Progressive Enhancement *Separation of protection and security *Transparency (computing) Category:Distributed computing ","title":"Failure transparency"},{"id":"9107339","text":"Kiril Dzhorov (; born 12 August 1975) is a retired Bulgarian footballer who played as a defender. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1975 births Category:Living people Category:Bulgarian footballers Category:First Professional Football League (Bulgaria) players Category:FC Vihren Sandanski players Category:F.C.

After qualifying as a solicitor, and then serving in the British Army in the Second Boer War, he was a Unionist Party member of the first Parliament of the Union of South Africa from 1910 to 1914. After further army service in the First World War and in Ireland in the 1920s, he was the Liberal Party Member of Parliament (MP) for Blackpool in the UK from 1923 to 1924. ==Early life== Meyler was born near Taunton, in Somerset, where his father was the town clerk. He was educated at King's College, Taunton and Allhallows Grammar School, Honiton, and then studied at the University of London. He qualified as a solicitor in 1898, briefly working in partnership with Herbert Byard Sheppard in Taunton. He was also an officer in the 2nd Volunteer Battalion of the Somersetshire Light Infantry. ==South Africa == Meyler left Taunton to serve in the Second Boer War, enlisting with the Imperial Yeomanry and serving with the Rhodesian Field Force in 1899 and early 1900. While in the field, he was commissioned into a regular army unit as a second lieutenant in the Middlesex Regiment on 5 May 1900, and served in the 2nd battalion of that regiment, where he was promoted to lieutenant on 29 March 1901. He took part in operations east of Pretoria in the Transvaal during Summer 1900, and later served with Mounted Infantry in the Orange River Colony.Hart‚Ä≤s Army list, 1903 After the end of the war in June 1902, he left Cape Town for the United Kingdom four months later on the SS Orient. For his service, he was awarded the Queen's South Africa Medal, the King's South Africa Medal, and the Union of South Africa Commemoration Medal. He resigned his commission in the regular army in 1903, and joined the reserve of officers, and then resigned from the reserve in 1911. He provided the British army with intelligence services during the Natal Rebellion in 1906, but his application for the Natal Native Rebellion Medal was declined. He married the daughter of Major General Alexander Lyon Emerson, and returned to South Africa to become a lawyer in Natal. He campaigned for the Colony of Natal to join the Union of South Africa, and was elected as a Unionist member of the House of Assembly in the first Parliament of South Africa in 1910, defeating Frederick Robert Moor, Prime Minister of Natal. ==First World War== He returned to England in 1914 to serve in the First World War, rejoining the Middlesex Regiment as a captain, and serving in France from January 1915. He was gassed at Bellewarde near Ypres in 1915 and awarded the Military Cross in June 1915. He transferred to the Border Regiment in October 1915, and then joined the Royal Flying Corps in March 1916, first as wing adjutant and then training as a balloon observation officer. He served as an observer in France with No.5 and No.8 Kite Balloon Company, in vulnerable hydrogen-filled balloons, and became flight commander in August 1916. Promoted to temporary major in June 1917 and temporary lieutenant colonel in November 1917, he commanded 2nd Balloon Wing. Despite his rank, he continued observing, and was injured in a parachute descent in September 1918, recording 123 hours of flying time in all. He was mentioned in despatches in June 1915 and December 1918. He was awarded the Belgian Croix de Guerre (with palm) and the Croix de Chevalier (5th class) of the Belgian Order of Leopold II (with swords and palm) in August 1917, and the Distinguished Service Order in January 1919. He was also awarded the 1914-15 Star, the British War Medal and the Victory Medal (known as Pip, Squeak and Wilfred). ==Post-war career== Meyler stood for Parliament in the 1918 general election, coming third in the Bethnal Green South West constituency, with 23.4% of the votes. He remained in the army, rejoining the Border Regiment and serving as a Legal Officer in Ireland. He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in January 1923. At the 1922 general election, he stood in the more promising Blackpool constituency, where he lost by only 166 votes to the sitting Conservative MP Leonard Molloy. Molloy did not contest the 1923 general election, and Meyler won the seat with a majority of over 3,000 votes, and he retired from the army. However, at the 1924 general election, Sir Walter de Frece retook the seat for the Conservatives. Meyler did not stand for Parliament again. He continued to speak in public, particularly on issues relating to South Africa. He became a \\"poor man's lawyer\\" in Westminster and Pimlico, but his legal practice did not prosper, and he shot himself in 1929. == References == * * * Magnificent lawyers in flying machines, Law Gazette, 8 July 2015 * Old Aluredian Club News, January 2015 * Dix Noonan Webb auctioneers, 25 March 2015 * Medical card, Lt Col H.M.

It has six vertices, 15 edges, 20 triangle faces, 15 tetrahedral cells, and 6 5-cell facets. It has a dihedral angle of cos‚àí1(), or approximately 78.46¬∞. The 5-simplex is a solution to the problem: Make 20 equilateral triangles using 15 matchsticks, where each side of every triangle is exactly one matchstick. == Alternate names == It can also be called a hexateron, or hexa-5-tope, as a 6-facetted polytope in 5-dimensions. The name hexateron is derived from hexa- for having six facets and teron (with ter- being a corruption of tetra-) for having four-dimensional facets. By Jonathan Bowers, a hexateron is given the acronym hix. == As a configuration== This configuration matrix represents the 5-simplex. The rows and columns correspond to vertices, edges, faces, cells and 4-faces. The diagonal numbers say how many of each element occur in the whole 5-simplex.

The cause was found to be small fatigue cracks in the rails and joint bars, not detectable by the inspection routines then enforced by Canadian Pacific. ==Derailment== At about 1:37 a.m. CST, 30 cars of a Canadian Pacific train derailed about four miles west of the city center, in a development called Terracita Vallejo in Harrison Township in Ward County. Five tanker cars carrying anhydrous ammonia ruptured, releasing a cloud of caustic, poisonous gas over the city. Soon after the derailment, a large area around the derailed train was evacuated, and residents in the remainder of the city were told to stay indoors. The accident killed one person, caused serious injuries to 11 more (including both of the train's crew members), and caused minor injuries to 322 others. ==Response== Dispatchers told residents to close doors and windows, boil water, and cover their faces with wet cloths to counteract the ammonia. Emergency response to the disaster was disorganized. Local emergency managers did not activate the city's radio-based Emergency Alert System. The public siren system failed during the event and the 911 telephone system became overloaded. Because it was the middle of the night, there were few people at local radio stations, all operated by Clear Channel with mostly automated programming. No formal emergency warnings were issued for several hours while Minot officials located station managers at home. North Dakota's public radio network, Prairie Public Broadcasting, was notified and did broadcast warnings to citizens. The incident has been cited as an example of the physical dangers of media consolidation and the cost-cutting practice of not keeping overnight staff at stations. Even without activation of the Emergency Alert System, a live announcer would still have been able to warn citizens of the emergency via the traditional means of the broadcast signal and an on-air microphone. As local stations were running in automated mode, there was nobody on-site to interrupt programming and issue warnings concerning the disaster.Klinenberg, Eric. Fighting for Air: The Battle to Control America's Media. Holt: New York, 2008. By the morning of January 18, the cloud was dissipating, but covered a wider area of the city. Governor John Hoeven arrived on a North Dakota National Guard helicopter to survey the disaster, landing near Dakota Square Mall for a brief press conference. ==Investigation== The accident was investigated by the National Transportation Safety Board. The NTSB determined that the train crew was operating their train at the appropriate speed through the region and adhering to operating procedures, and did not have alcohol or drugs in their system. Therefore, crew training or operation were ruled out as factors. The NTSB found evidence at the derailment site of fatigue cracking on the rail and on joint bars used to connect sections of track together. The joint bar failed, followed by failure of the rail itself, causing the train to derail. The NTSB determined that the railway was using visual inspection to inspect tracks in the area, and that this was inadequate to identify small fatigue cracks. As a result, the NTSB determined the probable cause of the derailment to be ineffective Canadian Pacific inspection and maintenance procedures, which resulted in failure to replace cracked joint bars before they fractured. ==Coverage and aftermath== The derailment made national news in the United States and Canada, though the CP involvement perhaps encouraged broader coverage in the latter. CBC reporters were on the scene the day of the disaster, and filed reports on the aftermath on the national news programs throughout the week, while ABC News provided only a short clip the day of the disaster. Cleanup operations began around 24 hours after the wreck, as soon as the gas cloud had dissipated enough to allow workers to safely get near the train. As part of the operations, CP removed ammonia-contaminated ice from the Souris River to avoid further environmental damage. After the disaster, CP opened a claims office in Minot to avoid a larger lawsuit. Residents were offered several hundred dollars as a settlement, waiving their rights to pursue a claim in court. The NTSB estimated that the accident caused over $2 million in damages, and another $8 million in environmental cleanup costs. Following the incident, the Minot city council imposed a speed limit on trains passing through the city. ==References== Category:Minot, North Dakota Category:Derailments in the United States Category:Railway accidents in 2002 Category:Transportation disasters in North Dakota Category:Rail transportation in North Dakota Category:Accidents and incidents involving Canadian Pacific Railway Category:2002 in North Dakota Category:January 2002 events in the United States ","title":"Minot train derailment"},{"id":"9107521","text":"Harris County High School is a public high school serving grades 9 through 12.

The film explores the recesses of the human conscious. It stars Oduvil Unnikrishnan in the lead with actors Narain, Murali, Sukumari, Reeja, Nedumudi Venu, Vijayaraghavan, Jagathi Sreekumar and Tara Kalyan in supporting roles. It premiered at the Venice Film Festival in the Orizzonti section and received critical acclaim. The film was awarded the FIPRESCI Prize at the festival. Cahiers du Cinema hailed the film as \\"the most poetic film this year in Venice\\". ==Overview== The title of the film Nizhalkuthu (Shadow Kill) refers to a popular play Nizhalkuthu Attakatha, adapted from the Mahabharata, about the inherent unjustness of certain punishments. In the play, the Kauravas force a witch hunter to kill the Pandavas by stabbing their shadows. However, the witch hunter's wife finds this out and is enraged. To punish her husband by making him feel what Kunti, the mother of Pandavas must feel, she kills their child in the same way. The film reflects that death penalty is probably in the same vein. We may---like the witch hunter's wife---be handing out punishments that are equally ridiculous under the false perception that we are doing justice, if not being directly criminal like the witch hunter. Adoor's usual cinematographer Mankada Ravi Varma filmed half of the project. But he was later replaced by Sunny Joseph, since the former fell ill and was later found to be suffering from Alzheimer's disease. ==Plot== The plot is set in the 1940s in a village of Travancore, British India. Kaliyappan, the last hangman of Travancore dynasty is dragging his remaining life by consuming alcohol and worshipping the Mother Goddess. The reason for this self-destruction is the remorse born out of the feeling that the last man he hanged was an innocent. While pulling on his life by boozing, worshiping the Goddess and treating ailing people with the ash obtained by burning the hanging rope, one day the King's messenger once again arrives with the King's order of appointing him for executing a convict termed as 'a killer, proved beyond doubt'. He leaves to the jail with his Gandhian, freedom fighter son to assist him in his job. As a tradition, the hangman has to spend the eve of the execution awake. When alcohol fails to keep Kaliyappan awake, the jailer starts telling a 'spicy tale' to keep him awake, the tale of a 13-year-old girl raped and killed by her own brother-in-law and an innocent musician boy convicted for this charge. When Kaliyappan comes to know the condemned person he is about to hang is that very same musician boy, he breaks down. The job of executing the convict is passed on to his assistant, his son. The Gandhian, freedom fighter son completes the job. His motivations are not spelt out, but the choice of title hints that the son perhaps punishes the father by reminding him that any of his prior executions may have been a farce just like this one. Just like the witch hunter's wife in Mahabharata, the son's sense of punishment completely ignores the innocent victim who would be executed. We are reminded that what we think of something as just may not always be so. ==Cast== *Oduvil Unnikrishnan as Kaliyappan the executioner *Sukumari as Marakatam, his wife *Mallika(Reeja) as Mallika , the younger daughter *Thara Kalyan as Madhavy, the older daughter *Murali as Vasu, Madhavy's Husband *Sivakumar as Mallika's Lover *Shivaji *Narain (actor) as Muthu, Kaliyappan's son *Nedumudi Venu as Jailer *Vijayaraghavan as Jailer *Jagathy Sreekumar as Maharajah's Officer *Indrans as Barber *Kukku Parameshwaram as Woman seeking treatment in Kaliyappan ==Crew== Sound Recording: N.

Richard Phillips of World Socialist Web Site said, \\"Shadow Kill provides an accurate and disturbing glimpse of the state apparatus created by the British colonial rulers and their local Indian agents and the treatment of those at the bottom of the pecking order. It is a dark and disturbing film with strong performances by its experienced cast. Oduvil Unnikrishnan as Kaliyappan is particularly noteworthy.\\" Laura and Robin Clifford of Reeling Reviews rated the film C+ and said, \\"While beautiful to look at, the film is slow moving and oddly sadistic.\\" Gautaman Bhaskaran of The Hindu stated, \\"Adoor Gopalakrishnan's latest celluloid creation is a profound statement on capital punishment. At the core is the human emotion of guilt which tests and tortures the hangman and gives the picture a poignantly novel angle.\\" The reviewer of Rediff.com concluded, \\"Nizhalkuthu, in the final analysis, comes across as a masterwork; a film that seeps in through the eyes and envelops the mind and doesn't let go\\". ==Awards== ;National Film Awards * National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Malayalam - Adoor Gopalakrishnan ;Others * Bombay International Film Festival - FIPRESCI Prize ; Kerala State Film Awards * Best Actor - Oduvil Unnikrishnan * Second Best Actor - Jagathy Sreekumar * Best Costume Designer - S.

New software, techniques and cloud services now makes it possible to extract the songs played on the radio and digitally save them on separate audio tracks. Available techniques make it possible to rip the music from Internet radio broadcasts, satellite radio broadcasts and FM radio broadcasts. Ripping is more than simply recording the audio. The key aspect of ripping is disambiguation. When ripping songs from any source, the songs should be split into separate tracks or files, and the songs should be tagged. Otherwise, one is simply recording or dubbing the audio. ==Internet radio== Popular audio formats for Internet radio include AAC, AAC+, and MP3. Many AM/FM stations simulcast online use the more efficient AAC format while Internet-only streams more typically use MP3. The Shoutcast database featured 34,281 online radio stations covering almost every conceivable music genre. Cloud recording services such as DAR.fm, Quick Record can record from all of these formats. Most PC based Internet radio ripping software is built for Shoutcast-style of streams as this MP3 based protocol offers the widest selection of Internet radio stations. Such wide selection of music is one of the major advantages for recording songs from Internet radio compared to FM and satellite radio as well as the fact that it works with cloud services that do not require a separate audio receiver. The disadvantages may include fairly low audio quality in the saved MP3s, which varies from stream to stream. To begin the recording process, the software connects to the audio stream over TCP. The stream is then buffered 15‚Äì30 seconds ahead. Some Internet radio ripping software, utilize special metadata that are being sent along with actual song content. These programs are generally more successful in determining the boundaries of songs (providing for a cleaner MP3 cut) as well as correctly identifying the song in question. Such metadata, however, are available for only a subset of Internet streams, commonly associated with the Shoutcast standard. The existence of open directories of Shoutcast-compliant radio stations such as Shoutcast enables Internet radio rippers to provide an abundant selection of recordable radio stations that are reasonably expected to emit detailed song metadata. The metadata also help avoid commercials from being recorded along with the songs. ==Satellite radio== TimeTrax has developed software that can record the audio broadcast on XM satellite radio. The software saves songs as individual MP3 files after identifying the name and the artist. TimeTrax is both a software and hardware solution: the TimeTrax software can interface with any PC-compatible satellite receiver, and the adapter box is necessary to allow certain receivers to interface with a PC. The XM PCR was the first device to allow audio stream ripping from XM radio. The device itself is simple enough: an XM \\"can\\" (the actual receiver and decoding hardware) is enclosed in a box with a USB interface chip and audio connector. The PCR plugs into a PC USB port and line-in jack. TimeTrax, or some other similar software, then controls the radio and records the incoming audio. After a legal battle, the TimeTrax software is no longer being sold. To end the problem for good, XM discontinued the XM PCR receiver. However, TimeTrax almost immediately released a hardware companion product that turned virtually any device capable of receiving XM satellite radio and its primary competitor at the time, Sirius Satellite Radio. Timetrax went on to also include the ability to rip and tag music from the online music streaming services that were being provided by both XM and Sirius. Notably, TimeTrax went on to extend its technology in a seamless package for FM radio, and further, any music source. It developed this portion of its technology hardware and software offering with Swedish company PopCatcher. TimeTrax was the first company that offered music ripping (a.k.a. audio disambiguation, ripping and tagging, de-aggregation) for the three largest and widespread music distribution methods: satellite radio, Internet streaming and traditional broadcast. The original TimeTrax software was developed by a Canadian, Scott MacLean. Its popularity resulted in a corporation and formal management team along with funding focused on MacLean's work. The company was led by business executive Elliott Frutkin. ==FM radio== There are three ways of ripping songs from an FM broadcast. ===Radio Data System=== Some FM receivers are capable of receiving a data stream known as Radio Data System or RDS. This provides artist and title information that can be shown on the display of a compatible FM receiver. A compatible receiver, connected to the computer, can tag saved audio streams with these data. The disadvantage of RDS is that the title may change before or after the song itself changes, causing the recording process to miss part of the beginning or end of the song. Some stations also use their display text as a secondary means of advertising themselves or a sponsor and might refuse outright to display title/artist text. In the near future RDS will include a new feature called RT+ or Radio Text Plus. As well as providing discrete text fields for Artist, Album & Track Title, RT+ includes 'item running' and 'item toggle' bits which can be used to accurately mark the track transitions and DJ/commercial interruptions, aiding the process of recording, filenaming and ID3 tagging. ===Separating music from non-music=== Swedish company PopCatcher has patented a technology that enables distinguishing between music, chatter and commercials. It is a self-learning process that first identifies the broadcasting habits of a given radio station. PopCatcher is designed to automatically exclude commercials and DJ patter from the recording, which results in \\"cleaner\\" audio files. The process is fully independent from the Internet. However, it does not recognize the names and the artists of the recorded songs. ===Manual tagging=== Certain recording packages allow the user to set markers in the file, which the user can use later to split the file into separate tracks. This process can be tedious and time consuming, but has the advantage of being the only truly reliable way to ensure that the song is captured as accurately as possible without cutting off the beginning or end of a track. ==Legal issues== This expanding way of ripping music may lead to 'strong legal debates' in a near future, even if it is permitted to record music from the radio for private use in most countries. In Germany it is allowed. There even is a campaign to put focus on it. It is called TauschNix, which in essence stands for: no need to download via filesharing. See link below. ===European context=== The European Union passed in May 2001 the Information Society Directive which has since then been transposed into the national laws of most of the Member States. Article 5 ‚Äì 2/b of the directive states that \\"[Member States may provide for exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right provided for] in respect of reproductions on any medium made by a natural person for private use and for ends that are neither directly nor indirectly commercial, on condition that the rightholders receive fair compensation which takes account of the application or non-application of technological measures referred to in Article 6 [ie. Digital Rights Management ] to the work or subject-matter concerned\\". In short, copying music from the radio for private use is permissible if the artists receive a \\"fair compensation\\". In case of a lawsuit against radio music ripping technologies, the whole debate will be about the meaning of the term \\"fair compensation\\". It can be argued that Radio stations are already paying a \\"fair compensation\\" to artists as they know their songs might be copied. Moreover, in an increasing number of EU member states, importers are charged a private copying levy on the purchase of recordable media (MP3 players, writable CDs or DVDs). The tax or levy is usually administrated by copyright collectives. However, at the time of digital copies, the outcome of such a lawsuit is far from being certain if it should occur. ===UK context=== Beginning in 1981, the British Phonographic Industry began a campaign against so-called \\"home taping\\", or recording songs from the radio onto cassettes, due to fears that home taping would decrease album sales. Iconic of the campaign is a picture of the silhouette of a cassette tape, with two crossed bones underneath, with the words \\"HOME TAPING IS KILLING MUSIC\\" written across the top, and the words \\"AND IT'S ILLEGAL\\" printed in smaller letters at the bottom. ===US context=== Traditionally, the recording industry expressed little or no concern with individuals who recorded music from the radio on a cassette recorder. However, the digital format in this case changes the whole issue since it does not degrade over time and can be easily copied. The Audio Home Recording Act also lays out certain legal rights on the part of consumers. ==References== Category:Copyright law Category:Audio storage Category:Internet radio Category:Ripping ","title":"Radio music ripping"},{"id":"9107656","text":"State Highway 251 (SH 251) is a Texas state highway running between Olney and Newcastle.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. The correct pronunciation of the tower is debated. The Heublein family came from Germany, where they pronounced it HOY- bline, but after immigrating to the United States, over the years it was pronounced HIGH-bline. After Heublein Inc. was bought by the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company in 1982, advertising was run on the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson, who pronounced it HUGH-bline. ==HistoryOrigin=== Gilbert Heublein was a magnate in the area of food and beverage, most notably as manufacturer of A.1. Steak Sauce and Smirnoff vodka; he founded Heublein Inc. While hiking with his then-fianc√© Louise M. Gundlach on Talcott Mountain, he promised her that one day he would build her a castle there. ===Construction=== Designed by Smith and Bassette to survive winds, and built by T. R. Fox and Son in 1914, the Heublein Tower served as Gilbert Heublein's summer home and retreat. Smith and Bassette also designed the north and south wings of Governor's Mansion in 1916. Truly an architectural marvel, Mr. Heublein modeled this structure after buildings in his native homeland of Bavaria. Standing tall and situated above the Farmington Valley, one can see for several dozen miles in all directions from the top floor observation lounge. The structure consists of a steel frame of girders anchored into the bedrock of the mountain ridge. The four columns in the four corners extend up to the second level and are made of reinforced concrete. A system of cross- girder braces adds strength to the shaft and cross-beams support the floors. It is also the site of the first home elevator in Connecticut. ===Ownership=== In 1943, the tower was purchased by The Hartford Times, and Heublein Tower became known as the Times Tower. The plan was to use the tower as a broadcasting location for a radio station owned by the paper, but this didn't work out. However, the tower was a place for parties and social gatherings hosted by the newspaper for nearly 20 years. The view of Hartford from atop the tower ==Restoration efforts== The Heublein Tower is managed by the State of Connecticut Department of Energy & Environmental Protection. Restoration and support of the Tower interior is funded in large part by the work of the non-profit organization, The Friends of Heublein Tower. The Friends' organization was established in 1985 and is dedicated to preserving and restoring the Heublein Tower and its surrounding estate. Most recent restoration activities include the installation of a white oak parquet floor in the observation room (known as the ballroom in Gilbert Heublein's day) designed in the same pattern as the original. ==Historical significance== Due to anti-German sentiment in the United States during World War I, rumors circulated that Gilbert Heublein was using a spotlight on top of the tower's cupola to inform German ships of the location of Allied vessels. In order to stop the rumors, Heublein offered the use of the tower to the state and federal governments, both of which declined. Several famous people have been guests at the tower. The Republican Party asked General Dwight D. Eisenhower to run for president there, an event which was also attended by Prescott Bush, father of George H. W. Bush. Ronald Reagan also visited the tower in the 1950s while he was president of the Screen Actors Guild. Others included Admiral Charles Nimitz, General Omar Bradley, architect Frank Lloyd Wright, opera singer James Melton, and actress Tallulah Bankhead. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Hartford County, Connecticut ==References== ==External links== * Friends of Heublein Tower Category:Buildings and structures in Simsbury, Connecticut Category:Towers in Connecticut Category:Buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in Connecticut Category:Tourist attractions in Hartford County, Connecticut Category:Metacomet Ridge, Connecticut Category:Museums in Hartford County, Connecticut Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1914 Category:National Register of Historic Places in Hartford, Connecticut ","title":"Heublein Tower"},{"id":"9107692","text":"Hairless, also known as H, is a well-characterized Drosophila gene. Many mutations to hairless are embryonic lethal; however, there are several viable hairless mutants. Hairless is involved in the Notch signaling pathway in Drosophila, acting as a suppressor of Notch signaling. Hairless (H) encodes a hydrophilic protein. The protein is composed of 1076 amino acids, with a molecular weight of 110 kDa. The H protein is reported in insects and is found in nearly all of the family Drosophilidae. The H protein is also found in the family Culicidae as well as the orders Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera and Coleoptera. In Drosophilia, NSP, or notch signaling pathway, allows for communication intercellularly during embryo development and also physiological activities of adult organisms.

They are currently members of the and play at the Dunscar Sports Complex. The club are affiliated to the Lancashire Football Association. The club's colours are yellow shirts and dark blue shorts. ==History== The original Eagley FC was formed in 1874. It was one of the first clubs in Lancashire playing under association football rules. The club was one of the founder members of the Lancashire County Football Association in 1878, and in 1878‚Äì79 it was the first recorded opponents of Preston North End, later to become the first ever English football champions. That season Eagley was the winner of the Turton Football Club Challenge Cup, the first football cup played for in Lancashire, and entered the FA Cup for the first time. In 1879‚Äì80, Eagley was one of the competitors in the first Lancashire Cup competition. With the rise of professional football, the original Eagley FC was disbanded. Many years later it was revived as Eagley Mills FC, which played in the Manchester League and in 1959‚Äì60 was the winner of the Lancashire Amateur Shield. The club declined in the 1970s until 1980 when a group of local enthusiasts stepped in to try to revive Eagley to some of its former glories. In 1981, the club appointed the ex-Walker Institute player Paul Thompson as manager with Peter Conroy as his assistant. This led to a further period of success in the Combination plus a Lancashire Junior Shield Final appearance, losing 3‚Äì2 to Latham & Burscough and a 2‚Äì1 Hospital Cup Final victory over Little Hulton. A new phase of the club's history was entered into on joining the West Lancashire League for the 1988‚Äì89 season. After two seasons settling into the league, the club appointed Terry Finney as team manager. Soon after, the club had success, being promoted to the Premier Division as champions. Finney's success continued over the next eight seasons with the club making appearances in the West Lancashire Presidents and Richardson's Cup finals, along with four Hospital Cup finals, winning two. However, during this period the club suffered a major blow when the clubhouse was completely destroyed by fire in August 1992. The Football and Cricket Clubs joined together to build a new clubhouse which is still used today.

It was the fifth final of the world's oldest football competition, the Football Association Challenge Cup (known in the modern era as the FA Cup). Wanderers had won the Cup on two previous occasions. The Etonians were playing in their second consecutive final, having lost in the 1875 final. Both teams had conceded only one goal in the four rounds prior to the final. In the semi-finals Wanderers defeated Swifts and the Etonians beat the 1874 FA Cup winners Oxford University. The match finished in a 1‚Äì1 draw, the second time an FA Cup Final had finished all-square. John Hawley Edwards scored for Wanderers, but the Etonians equalised with a goal credited in modern publications to Alexander Bonsor, although contemporary newspaper reports do not identify him as the scorer. A week later, the replay took place at the same venue. The Etonians were forced to make a number of changes due to players being unavailable, and the revised team was no match for the Wanderers, who won 3‚Äì0. Charles Wollaston and Thomas Hughes scored a goal apiece in a five-minute spell before half-time, and Hughes added the third early in the second half. ==Route to the final== Old Etonians, the team for former pupils of Eton College,Warsop, p. 21 had reached the 1875 final but been defeated by Royal Engineers. Wanderers had won the competition in both 1872 and 1873 but had not progressed beyond the quarter- finals in the subsequent two seasons. Both teams entered the 1875‚Äì76 competition at the first round stage and were allocated matches at home. Wanderers defeated a team from the 1st Surrey Rifles regiment 5‚Äì0, and the Etonians overcame Pilgrims 4‚Äì1. In the second round Wanderers defeated Crystal Palace (not the current professional club) 3‚Äì0 and the Etonians had an easy win over Maidenhead, scoring eight goals without reply. At the quarter-final stage, Wanderers took on the world's oldest football club, Sheffield F.C. and won 20, and the Etonians gained a 1‚Äì0 victory over Clapham Rovers. Both semi- final matches took place at Kennington Oval in London, as stipulated in the original rules of the competition. The Etonians beat the 1874 FA Cup winners Oxford University 10 in the first semi-final, and a week later Wanderers clinched their place in the final, defeating the Slough-based club Swifts 21. ==MatchSummary=== Etonian player Alfred Lyttelton also played first- class cricket, as depicted in this caricature published in Vanity Fair in 1884 Three sets of brothers played in the match. Francis and Hubert Heron lined up for the Wanderers, while the Etonians' team included Hon. Edward Lyttelton and his brother Hon. Alfred Lyttelton and Albert Meysey-Thompson and his brother Charles. The latter pair's surname had been simply Thompson until it was changed in 1874, and for the final Albert played under the name Thompson and Charles under the name Meysey.Warsop, p. 45 This is the only occasion that two or more pairs of brothers have played in the same FA Cup Final. Later that year, Francis Birley married Margaret, sister of his teammate Jarvis Kenrick.Warsop, p. 64 The Etonian team also included Julian Sturgis, who had been born in the U.S. and was the first foreign-born player to appear in the Cup Final (discounting those born to British parents in the British Empire),Warsop, p. 128 as well as Arthur Kinnaird, who had captained Wanderers to victory in the 1873 FA Cup Final.Warsop, p. 93 Wanderers began the match with two full-backs, two half-backs and six forwards, while the Etonians opted for one full-back, two half-backs and seven forwards. Wanderers won the coin toss and chose to start the game defending the Harleyford Road end of The Oval. The crowd was estimated at 3,500, the largest for an FA Cup Final up to that point.Warsop, pp. 40‚Äì45 The match was played in a strong wind, to the extent that when Frederick Maddison took a corner kick for Wanderers, the gale blew the ball back out of play. The Wanderers dominated the early stages of the game, but the Etonians kept them at bay for around 35 minutes until Charles Wollaston eluded Thompson and passed the ball to John Hawley Edwards, who kicked it narrowly under the crossbar of the Etonians' goal to give Wanderers the lead.Warsop, p. 33 In the second half the Old Etonians had the wind in their favour and had the better of the play. Around five minutes after the interval, a corner kick to the Etonians led to a \\"scrimmage\\" (a term in common use at the time to describe a group of players struggling to gain possession of the ball) in front of their opponents' goal, which resulted in the ball and a number of players being forced over the goal-line, uprooting the goalposts in the process. Modern sources credit the goal to Alexander Bonsor, but contemporary newspaper reports in The Sporting Life and Bell's Life in London do not mention his name, merely noting that the goal was scored \\"from a scrimmage\\". Neither team could manage to score another goal, and the game finished with the scores level, meaning that for the second successive season a replay would be needed to determine the winners of the competition. ===Details=== { width=100% -   } { width=\\"100%\\" valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"50%\\" { style=\\"font-size: 90%\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" colspan=\\"4\\"Wanderers: - !width=25 !!width=25 - GK  W.

The Wanderers fielded an unchanged team, but the Etonians had to make a number of changes, as Meysey was injured and three other players were unavailable due to other commitments. One of the replacements, Edgar Lubbock, had not long recovered from a bout of illness and was noted as being out of practice, and Kinnaird was still suffering the after-effects of an injury sustained in the original match. The weather on the day of the match was extremely cold, with the threat of snow. The Etonians began the match playing in a rough manner, and there were also many appeals from the players for handball, which disrupted play. After around half an hour, the Wanderers' forwards surged towards their opponents' goal and Charles Wollaston got the final kick which sent the ball past goalkeeper Quintin Hogg, one of the replacement players brought in for the replay.Warsop, p. 34 Almost immediately afterwards, another massed attack by the Wanderers led to Thomas Hughes doubling the lead. Soon after half-time, Hawley Edwards, Francis Heron and Jarvis Kenrick combined in a skilful attack and set up Hughes to score his second goal of the game. Although the Wanderers' goalkeeper, W. D. O. Greig, was called into action several times, the Etonians were unable to get the ball past him, and the match finished 3‚Äì0 to the Wanderers. The winning team's captain Francis Birley was praised for his performance by the press, as were both Lyttleton brothers for the Etonians. ===Details=== { width=100% -   } { width=\\"100%\\" valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"50%\\" { style=\\"font-size: 90%\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" colspan=\\"4\\"Wanderers: - !width=25 !!width=25 - GK  W.

It was inactivated in 2014.64th Air Expeditionary Group Deactivated, Published 9 May 2014 The group was first activated in December 1940 as the 64th Transport Group, a year before the Attack on Pearl Harbor. During the Second World War it fought primarily with Twelfth Air Force, earning a Distinguished Unit Citation. ==History== The 64th Air Expeditionary Group is a provisional unit and uses the emblem of the inactive 64th Flying Training Wing. ===World War II=== Constituted as the 64th Transport Group on 20 November 1940. Activated on 4 December 1940. Used Douglas C-47s for training and flying transport missions in the US. Redesignated 64th Troop Carrier Group in July 1942. Moved to England in August 1942 and received additional training. Became part of Twelfth Air Force. Moved to the Mediterranean theater, November‚ÄìDecember 1942. Flew first mission on 11 November, landing paratroops at Maison Blanche Airport. Dropped paratroops to capture airfields during the battle for Tunisia. Released paratroops near Gela and Catania when the Allies invaded Sicily in July 1943. Dropped paratroops near Avellino during the invasion of Italy in September 1943 to destroy a bridge on the enemy‚Äôs supply line to Salerno. Participated in the assault on southern France in August 1944 by releasing gliders and paratroops in the battle zone. Supported the partisans in northern Italy early in 1945 by dropping paratroops, supplies, and propaganda leaflets behind enemy lines. When not engaged in airborne combat operations, the group continually transported men and supplies to the front lines and evacuated wounded personnel. Most of the group was on detached service in the China Burma India Theater from April‚ÄìJune 1944, while a skeletal remnant remained in Sicily. With its squadrons operating from separate bases in India, the group aided the Allied offensive in Burma. It was awarded a Distinguished Unit Citation for flying unarmed over rugged enemy territory to carry food, clothing, medical supplies, guns, ammunition, and mules to the combat zone and to evacuate wounded personnel. The group moved to Trinidad in June 1945. Assigned to Air Transport Command. Inactivated on 31 July 1945. Activated in the United States on 19 May 1947. Not manned during 1947‚Äì1948. Inactivated on 10 September 1948. ===Cold War=== The 64th performed airlift and airdrop/airlanding of troops and cargo, routinely and during frequent maneuvers, 1952‚Äì1953. It began phasing down for inactivation in mid-October 1953, at which time tactical operations passed to 63d Troop Carrier Wing. In February 1954, however, the wing began building up again in preparation for an overseas movement, but was inactivated instead. ===Flying training=== From the implementation of the Objective Wing organization until 1997, the group served as the flying arm of the 64th Flying Training Wing. ===Expeditionary operations=== The 64 AEG/AEW operated out of Camp Snoopy at Doha International Airport, Qatar from 1996 until 2004. In 2005, the group was activated for defense of personnel and assets in Southwest Asia. It provided force protection and support services for the installation in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia known as Eskan Village, replacing the former 320th Air Expeditionary Group. The group was made up of about 300 security forces, support airmen, and civilians in two squadrons: the 64th Expeditionary Security Forces Squadron and the 64th Expeditionary Support Squadron. Their mission was to stand guard, provide integrated defense, emergency response, and combat support for the base, which houses military and host-nation tenant agencies. Most days the airmen fought the Global War on Terrorism in extreme temperatures of more than 100 degrees Fahrenheit.U.S. Air Force News Service ==Lineage== Group * Constituted as the 64th Transport Group on 20 November 1940 : Activated on 4 December 1940 * Redesignated: 64th Troop Carrier Group on 1 July 1942 : Inactivated 31 July 1945 * Activated on 19 May 1947 : Inactivated on 10 September 1948 * Redesignated: 64th Troop Carrier Group, Medium on 3 July 1952 : Activated on 14 July 1952 : Inactivated on 21 July 1954 * Redesignated 64th Military Airlift Group on 31 July 1985 * Redesignated: 64th Operations Group on 1 May 1991 : Activated on 15 May 1991 : Inactivated on 30 September 1997 * Redesignated as 64th Air Expeditionary Group, converted to provisional status and assigned to Air Combat Command to activate or inactivate as needed on 4 December 2001 :: Activated December 2001 :: Inactivated unknown :: Activated 2005 :: Inactivated 1 May 2014 ===Assignments=== * Fourth Air Force, 4 December 1940 * 50th Transport Wing, 31 March 1942 * 51st Transport Wing (later 51st Troop Carrier Wing), 1 June 1942 * Eighth Air Force, 18 August 1942 * 51st Troop Carrier Wing, 1 September 1942 * Twelfth Air Force, 4 September 1942 * 51st Troop Carrier Wing, 25 October 1942 * 52d Troop Carrier Wing, 15 June 1943 * 51st Troop Carrier Wing, 11 July 1943 (air echelon attached to Tenth Air Force, c. 7 April ‚Äì c. 15 June 1944) * Air Transport Command, 25 May 1945 ‚Äì 31 July 1945 * Tactical Air Command, 19 May 1947 ‚Äì 10 September 1948 * 64th Troop Carrier Wing, 14 July 1952 ‚Äì 21 July 1954 (attached to 443d Troop Carrier Wing, 19 July ‚Äì 16 October 1952; 63d Troop Carrier Wing, 15 October 1953 ‚Äì 15 February 1954) * 64 Flying Training Wing, 15 May 1991 ‚Äì 1 April 1997 * Air Combat Command to activate or inactivate any time after 4 December 2001 :: December 2001 ‚Äì unknown :: 379th Air Expeditionary Wing, 23 September 2005 ‚Äì 1 May 2014 ===Stations=== * Duncan Field, Texas, 4 December 1940 * March Field, California, c. 13 July 1941; * Hamilton Field, California, c. 1 February 1942 * Westover Field, Massachusetts, c. 8 June ‚Äì 31 July 1942; * RAF Ramsbury, England, August‚ÄìNovember 1942 * Blida Airfield, Algeria, December 1942 * Kairouan Airfield, Tunisia, 28 June 1943 * El Djem Airfield, Tunisia, 26 July 1943 * Comiso Airfield, Sicily, 29 August 1943 * Ciampino Airfield, Italy, 10 July 1944 * Rosignano Airfield, Italy, 10 January ‚Äì 23 May 1945 * Waller Field, Trinidad, 4 June ‚Äì 31 July 1945 * Langley Field (later Langley Air Force Base), Virginia, 19 May 1947 ‚Äì 10 September 1948 * Donaldson Air Force Base, South Carolina, 14 July 1952 ‚Äì 21 July 1954 * Reese Air Force Base, Texas 15 May 1991 ‚Äì 1 April 1997 * Doha International Air Base, Qatar (1997‚Äì2005) * Eskan Village, Saudi Arabia, 23 September 2005 ‚Äì 1 May 2014 ===Components=== Squadrons * 16th Transport Squadron (later 16th Troop Carrier Squadron): 4 December 1940 ‚Äì 31 July 1945, 19 May 1947 ‚Äì 10 September 1948 * 17th Transport Squadron (later 17th Troop Carrier Squadron): 4 December 1940 ‚Äì 31 July 1945, 19 May 1947 ‚Äì 10 September 1948, 14 July 1952 ‚Äì 21 July 1954 * 18th Transport Squadron (later 18th Troop Carrier Squadron): 4 December 1940 ‚Äì 31 July 1945 * 33d Flying Training Squadron: 15 December 1991 ‚Äì 1 October 1992 * 35th Transport Squadron (later 35th Troop Carrier Squadron, 35th Flying Training Squadron): 4 December 1940 ‚Äì 31 July 1945, 19 May 1947 ‚Äì 10 September 1948, 15 December 1991 ‚Äì 31 July 1996 * 52d Flying Training Squadron: 15 December 1991 ‚Äì 1 April 1997 * 54th Transport Squadron (later 54th Flying Training) Squadron: 1‚Äì11 June 1942; 15 December 1991 ‚Äì 1 April 1997 * 64th Expeditionary Security Forces Squadron 23 September 2005 ‚Äì 1 May 2014 * 64th Expeditionary Support Squadron 23 September 2005 ‚Äì 1 May 2014 * T-1A Flying Training Squadron, Provisional, attached 15 December 1991 ‚Äì 1 October 1992 ===Aircraft=== * Douglas C-47 Skytrain, 1940‚Äì1945 * C-82 Packet (1952‚Äì1953) * C-119 Flying Boxcar (1953‚Äì1954) * T-37 Tweet (1991‚Äì1997) * T-38 Talon (1991‚Äì1997) * T-1 Jayhawk (1992‚Äì1997) ==See also== ==ReferencesNotes=Bibliography=== * * * ==External links== * * Photo gallery * Joe's USAF Blue Book * 64th AEG welcomes new commander * 064 Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 2014 Category:Saudi Arabia‚ÄìUnited States relations ","title":"64th Air Expeditionary Group"},{"id":"9107843","text":"SelTrac is a digital railway signalling technology used to automatically control the movements of rail vehicles. It was the first fully automatic moving-block signalling system to be commercially implemented. What is now branded as SelTrac was originally developed in the 1970s by Standard Elektrik Lorenz (the \\"SEL\\" in the name) of Germany for the Krauss-Maffei Transurban, an automated guideway transit system proposed for the GO-Urban network in the Greater Toronto Area in Canada. Although the GO-Urban project failed, the Transurban efforts were taken over by an Ontario consortium led by the Urban Transportation Development Corporation (UTDC), and adapted to become its Intermediate Capacity Transit System (ICTS). This technology was first used on the SkyTrain network in Vancouver, British Columbia and the Scarborough RT in Toronto, Ontario. SelTrac was primarily sold and developed by Alcatel, through a subsidiary. SelTrac is now sold by Thales from their Canadian unit, after it purchased many of Alcatel's non-telephony assets. New versions were made for different markets, and today SelTrac is used for rolling stock control around the world. ==DescriptionCommunication=== The original SelTrac system was based on inductive loops that provided a communications channel as well as positioning information. Normally an inductive loop is used solely as a communications system, with electromagnets on the vehicles or stations inducing currents in the loop that can be read at a distant location. In the case of SelTrac, the central computer sent data to the vehicles at 1200 bit/s on a 36 kHz carrier while the vehicles had 600 bit/s on a 56 kHz carrier. Separate pair of antennas is used for transmission and another pair is used for reception. The two-wire inductive loop system was prone to vandalism and, in newer versions of SelTrac, the control signal is transmitted inside the running rails at radio frequency using IEEE 802.11 (WiFi) access points. ===Position keeping=== SelTrac uses the twisted-loop concept developed by Siemens in the 1950s., see LZB. SelTrac's loops cross every 25 meters to form lozenge-shaped areas. The communications system on the vehicles can detect a phase change in the signal caused by these crossover points, allowing them to place themselves within a single one of these sub-loops. Position within the loop can be further measured by counting axle revolutions. The vehicles broadcast this position information into the loops, along with IDs, speed, direction and other data. This system is not accurate enough for positioning within a station. Further accuracy is provided by \\"station alignment boards\\" which the train attempts to capture directly beside a sensor. When approaching a station, the vehicle is slowed to allow the board to be captured by the onboard sensors, and the vehicle automatically brakes to a stop at a constant speed when it is seen. If the train passes the board, due to ice on the rails for instance, the train has to be manually reversed to capture it again. The stopping position of the train is especially important when the platform doors are used. Both sets of doors, train doors and platform doors must be precisely aligned, with just a few cm tolerance, to avoid the obstruction for passengers (specifically on wheelchairs). Platform doors are widely used on stations with expected large crowds of passengers such as in Shanghai Metro, Mekkah, Dubai and others. ===Traffic control=== In traditional train control, the railway is split into control \\"blocks\\" with signals in each one. Blocks are sized to allow the heaviest or fastest trains to stop fully within them. That way if a train is stopped in the next block, the following train will always have time to fully stop before reaching it. Careful tuning of block spacing is needed; if they are signals that are placed too close from each other, train speeds have to be reduced so they can still stop in time, but spacing them out further means the trains are also spread out and the route capacity drops. SelTrac automatically maintains headway between vehicles through a moving block system. In this system the start and end points of the blocks are not fixed, and move along with the trains. This allows the central control system to calculate a point on the track where every train can safely move without further instruction‚Äîin a fixed block system this would be the next set of signals, but with SelTrac it is constantly being updated. In theory this system could eliminate the \\"brick wall\\" criterion and allow the trains to run as close together as the communications speed would allow, but in practice a further spacing is typically imposed (for instance 50 m in the case of the Docklands Light Railway). ===Speed control=== When originally being designed, computers were expensive and data storage was limited. In keeping with this model, the original SelTrac used on the ICTS centralized all control. After receiving location information from a vehicle, the blocks and safe target points for each were calculated, and this information was then broadcast back out through the inductive loop to be received by the vehicles. Onboard controllers used this information to calculate a safe speed to approach the next target point, and modified its current speed appropriately. The system was designed to reduce the complexity, and thus cost, of the vehicle controllers as much as possible. In modern systems, much more information can be stored in the vehicle controllers. These now know the layout of the track, speed limits and various other data. This allows the controllers to make much better decisions about setting their speed‚Äîspeeding up before an incline for instance. == Product family == SelTrac is offered in two ways: 1\\\\. A complete integrated solution in which movement authority and interlocking are integrated within wayside zone controllers; this reduces equipment and potential interfacing issues. Integrating the management of the interlocking with train location information, as communicated through the CBTC system, allows faster response times, more tightly controlled movements, and easier expandability and adaptability. Interfaces within the zone controller are more easily designed than those between subsystems. The integrated system knows the position of each train to a high degree of accuracy. It can control the behavior of the train at all times and, in response to changing conditions, can modify the behavior to ensure safety of the system while offering maximum service. It can adapt its algorithms to take advantage of individual train behavior, and change parameters to ensure optimum use of resources, such as platform availability and traction power. The limit of movement authority setting logic has a high impact on the end system performance, i.e. managing the interlocking in an integrated manner. Interlocking and switch control logic is optimized using position reports of communicating trains. The integrated design includes: * Unattended and driverless train operation and cab-signalling modes * Moving-block technology * Automatic performance modification * Fully redundant train to wayside configurations * Data communication option (loop or radio) * Automatic route setting * Quick-start reset * Solid-state interlocking and remote point machine control * Automatic coupling/uncoupling 2\\\\. A 'progressive' overlay solution: (a) Speed and signal safeguard: it vitally supervises speed profiles and signal adherence and provides all the functions of an intermittent ATP (automatic train protection) (b) Continuous automatic train protection: provides the added value of improved headway while maintaining safe train separation, without depending on axle counters or track circuits. The system will automatically generate movement authorities based on actual locations of moving and fixed obstacles. It is used in conjunction with external interlockings and provides a replacement for automatic separation signals between interlockings. It can operate seamlessly with existing track circuits, which provides an inherent mechanism to operate mixed-mode traffic. (c) Automatic train operation (ATO) offering automatic train movement allowing a driver to operate \\"hands-off\\" and thereby improve running performance. Moving to fully automatic operation (FAO) provides an excellent means to match train supply to passenger demand. == Data communication == Data communication is provided with either low frequency inductive loop or a high bandwidth, open-standards wireless system incorporating spread-spectrum radio technology. === Data Communication System (DCS) === * Open-standard single integrated network providing communication between all train control subsystems and consists of three major elements: ** free-space radio link (to/from all trains) ** wayside network ** security system. * Ethernet IP network is based on the IEEE 802.3 standard. * Radios, compliant with the IEEE 802.11 standard, are deployed at measured intervals along the trackside and are used to provide a wireless link to the trains. * Each train has a mobile radio at each end used to provide an interface to the vehicle on-board computer and to complete the wireless link to the trackside. * All equipment used to create the DCS system is commercial off-the-shelf (COTS). == SelTrac installations == SelTrac is installed in many railways around the world, including the following: * Ankara Metro Line M1 1997 SelTrac CBTC DTO * Beijing Subway Line 4 2009 SelTrac CBTC/R (radio) ATO with Attendant * Busan‚ÄìGimhae Light Rail Transit 2011 SelTrac CBTC/R UTO * Canadian Pacific Railway - BC North Line 1990 ATCS Radio-Based Train Protection * Detroit People Mover 1987 SelTrac CBTC UTO * Dubai Metro ‚Äì Red and Green Lines 2009/2011 SelTrac CBTC UTO * Edmonton Light Rail Transit 2014 SelTrac CBTC/R ATP * Guangzhou Metro **Line 3 2009/10 SelTrac CBTC DTO **Line 9 2017 SelTrac CBTC DTO **Line 14 2017 SelTrac CBTC DTO **Line 21 2017 SelTrac CBTC DTO * Hong Kong International Airport APM 2014/15 SelTrac CBTC/R UTO * Hong Kong MTR ** West Rail Line 2003 SelTrac CBTC DTO ** Ma On Shan Line 2004 SelTrac CBTC DTO ** Disneyland Resort Line 2005 SelTrac CBTC/R UTO ** Kowloon Southern Link (West Rail Line) 2009 SelTrac CBTC DTO * Hyderabad Metro Rail (Lines 1, 2, 3) 2017 SelTrac CBTC/R STO * Incheon Subway Line 2 2014 SelTrac CBTC/R UTO * Istanbul Metro M4 Kadikoy-Kartal Line 2012 SelTrac CBTC STO * Jacksonville Skyway ASE 1998 SelTrac CBTC UTO * John F.

It was the seventh final of the world's oldest football competition, the Football Association Challenge Cup (known in the modern era as the FA Cup). Wanderers had won the Cup in the previous two seasons and on four previous occasions in total, including the first FA Cup Final, in 1872, in which they defeated the Engineers. The Engineers had also won the Cup, having defeated Old Etonians in the 1875 final. Wanderers, who were considered firm favourites to win the Cup for the third consecutive season, took the lead after only five minutes through Jarvis Kenrick, but the Engineers quickly equalised. The cup-holders regained their lead before half-time and added a third goal after the interval to secure a 3‚Äì1 victory. Under the original rules of the competition, the Cup was retired and presented to the club on a permanent basis to mark their third straight win, but the Wanderers returned the Cup to The Football Association on the condition that it never again be won outright by any club. ==Route to the final== Wanderers were the reigning cup holders and had also won the tournament in 1872, 1873 and 1876. In the first of these victories they had defeated the Royal Engineers. The Engineers had won the competition in 1875. Both teams entered the competition at the first round stage. Wanderers were allocated a home tie against Panthers and easily defeated their opponents 9‚Äì1, proceeding to the second round where they were paired with High Wycombe and again recorded a high-scoring victory, winning 9‚Äì0. Their opponents in the third round, Barnes, proved stronger opposition, particularly as key players such as Hon. Arthur Kinnaird were unavailable for the cup-holders.Cavallini, p. 50 The match ended in a 1‚Äì1 draw necessitating a replay, which Wanderers (back to full strength) won 4‚Äì1. In the quarter-finals Wanderers defeated Sheffield 3‚Äì0 and then, with an uneven number of teams remaining in the competition, the team received a bye into the final. The Engineers' scheduled first round opponents were Highbury Union, but they withdrew from the competition, giving the Engineers a walkover victory. The \\"Sappers\\", as the Royal Engineers regiment is traditionally nicknamed, went on to defeat Pilgrims 6‚Äì0 and Druids 8‚Äì0, with hat-tricks in both matches from Lieut. Robert Hedley,Warsop, pp. 84‚Äì85Collett, p. 528 to reach the quarter-finals where their opponents were 1874 cup-winners Oxford University. The initial match finished in a 3‚Äì3 draw, and the replay also finished without a victor, ending 2‚Äì2. Finally, the Engineers emerged victorious in a second replay, winning 4‚Äì2. This set up a semi-final match against Old Harrovians, the team for former pupils of Harrow School. The match was played at Kennington Oval and the Engineers reached the final by defeating the Harrovians 2‚Äì1. ==MatchSummary=== Lovick Friend was in goal for the Engineers. Wanderers, who were considered the firm favourites by the book-makers, won the coin toss and chose to defend the Harleyford Road end of The Oval. The match drew a crowd estimated at 4,500 spectators, the highest yet recorded for an FA Cup Final.Warsop, pp. 40‚Äì48 Both teams played with two full-backs, two half-backs and six forwards; the team captains were the Hon. Arthur Kinnaird and Lieut. Robert Hedley. The cup-holders immediately dominated the game and Kinnaird quickly had an unsuccessful shot on goal. After only five minutes Henry Wace crossed the ball from a wide position and Jarvis Kenrick kicked the ball past the Engineers' goalkeeper Lieut. Lovick Friend to give the Wanderers the lead.Warsop, p. 35 Approximately ten minutes later, Wanderers goalkeeper James Kirkpatrick suffered a broken arm during a tussle on the goal-line, but managed to keep the ball out of the goal, and went on to play the remainder of the match despite his injury. In the 20th minute of the game, the Engineers scored an equalising goal. Some modern sources state that Lieut. William Morris scored the goal, however contemporary newspaper reports in The Field, The Sporting Life and Bell's Life in London all state that Morris took a throw-in which led to a \\"scrimmage\\" or \\"bully\\" in front of the Wanderers' goal, out of which the ball was forced over the goal-line.Warsop, p. 36 Towards the end of the first half, the Wanderers were awarded a free kick. Kinnaird took the kick, which led to a second goal for the cup-holders. Modern sources list Kinnaird as the goalscorer, but some contemporary reports suggest that, following his free kick, another \\"scrimmage\\" ensued in front of the Engineers' goal before the ball was forced over the line. Shortly after the half-time break, the Engineers' captain Robert Hedley appeared to have scored a goal, but it was disallowed due to an infringement of the offside rule. After around twenty minutes of the second half, Kenrick scored his second goal following some skilful play by Hubert Heron, giving Wanderers a 3‚Äì1 lead which they retained until the end of the game. ===Details=== { width=100% -   } { width=\\"100%\\" valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"50%\\" { style=\\"font-size: 90%\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" colspan=\\"4\\"Wanderers: - !width=25 !!width=25 - GK   James Kirkpatrick - FB   Alfred Stratford - FB   William Lindsay - HB   Hon.

No substitutes. ==Post-match== As was the norm until 1882, the winning team did not receive the trophy at the stadium on the day of the match, but later in the year at their annual dinner.Warsop, p. 53 Under the original rules of the competition, if a team won the Cup three times in succession, it would be retired and become their \\"absolute property\\". Wanderers secretary C. W. Alcock, however, returned the Cup to The Football Association on the condition that the rule be removed and no other team permitted to win the Cup outright.Cavallini, p. 51 The only other team to win the Cup in three successive seasons to date is Blackburn Rovers, who won it three times in a row in the 1880s. On that occasion the club was presented with a commemorative shield. Three weeks after the Cup final, Wanderers played Scottish Cup winners Vale of Leven at Kennington Oval in a match for the unofficial \\"championship of Britain\\". In front of a crowd of around 2,000 spectators, Wanderers turned in what was regarded by the press as a sub-standard performance and were defeated 3‚Äì1. ==Notes== :A.

The landing of the British expeditionary force under Sir Ralph Abercromby was intended to defeat or drive out an estimated 21,000 remaining troops of Napoleon's ill-fated invasion of Egypt. The fleet commanded by Baron Keith included seven ships of the line, five frigates and a dozen armed corvettes. With the troop transports, it was delayed in the bay for several days by strong gales and heavy seas before disembarkation could proceed. Under General Friant, some 2000 French troops and ten field guns in high positions took a heavy toll of a large British force disembarking from a task-force fleet in boats, each carrying 50 men to be landed on the beach. The British then rushed and overwhelmed the defenders with fixed bayonets and secured the position, enabling an orderly landing of the remainder of their 17,500-strong army and its equipment. The skirmish was a prelude to the Battle of Alexandria and resulted in British losses of 730 killed and wounded or missing.

Sherborne Castle, Dorset Digby was the son of Hon. Edward Digby, son of William Digby, 5th Baron Digby. His mother was Charlotte Fox, daughter of Sir Stephen Fox and sister of Henry Fox, 1st Baron Holland. He was a close connection of the Foxes, and from 1744 on regularly attended their annual shooting-party in Wiltshire. On 13 June 1751, he was returned at Malmesbury on Henry Fox's interest after the death of James Douglas. Around this time, he was appointed a Groom of the Bedchamber to George, Prince of Wales. On 27 November 1752, he succeeded his grandfather William as Baron Digby, an Irish peerage which did not oblige him to vacate his seat in the Commons. He resigned his bedchamber office in 1753 as a result of his succession, by which he inherited Sherborne Castle in Dorset. Digby intended to contest Dorset, where he had large estates, in the next general election and asked for the support of the Duke of Newcastle, but when George Trenchard nominated him at the county meeting of gentlemen in August 1753, there was no enthusiasm for his candidacy and he dropped the plan. Instead, Fox had him returned for Wells at the 1754 election on a joint interest with Charles Tudway. As befitted a connection of Fox, Digby was a Whig, but took relatively little interest in politics. His health was poor, and he hoped to obtain a higher peerage, either a British title or an Irish earldom, an object left unfulfilled. In 1756, he was operated on for kidney stones by Dr. Adair Hawkins. He survived the surgery, but the wound was slow to heal, and he was left an invalid until he died on 30 November 1757. Digby was known for acts of great benevolence. In particular, he was known to visit the Marshalsea Debtors' prison at least twice annually, at Christmas and Easter, and each time secure the release of a number of prisoners by paying off their debts. He would then take the newly freed individuals to George Inn in Borough for dinner.The Penny Story-Teller, 2 January 1833. Digby never married and was succeeded in the barony by his younger brother Henry, who was created Earl Digby in 1790. ==References== Category:1730 births Category:1757 deaths Category:Barons in the Peerage of Ireland Category:Members of the Parliament of Great Britain for English constituencies Category:British MPs 1747‚Äì1754 Category:British MPs 1754‚Äì1761 Category:Whig (British political party) MPs Edward ","title":"Edward Digby, 6th Baron Digby"},{"id":"9107962","text":"The 1880 FA Cup Final was contested by Clapham Rovers and Oxford University at the Kennington Oval.

The ball hit the Oxford crossbar with a shot from Edward Ram and Harold Brougham shot just over the same bar. In the second half, six minutes before the close of time, the deadlock was broken when Francis Sparks conducted the ball to within \\"about six yards of the University goal\\". Although Oxford's Charles King attempted to stop the ball with a weak mis-kick, Lloyd-Jones, \\"who had followed well up shot it between the posts.

Then, he lost two full seasons (1955‚Äì56) to service in the United States Navy. When his pro career began in earnest in , Roach hit .304 in 107 games in the high minors. After his early-August recall by the 1957 Braves‚Äîen route to the world championship‚Äîhe sat on the bench as a seldom-used pinch hitter and backup infielder. He appeared in only six regular-season games, and was idle during the 1957 World Series. In , Roach made the Braves' roster out of spring training and an early-season injury to centerfielder Bill Bruton opened a spot for Roach as the right fielder in the Milwaukee lineup (with Baseball Hall of Famer Hank Aaron switching from right- field to Bruton's position). Roach started three games and collected seven hits in 15 at bats (.467), but when the roster had to be trimmed from 28 to 25 players in mid-May, Roach was optioned to Triple-A Wichita, where he appeared in 20 games over a full month before getting recalled to majors. Over the next two months he got into 39 games, largely as a backup to Hall of Fame second baseman Red Schoendienst, and was hitting .309 with 42 hits and three home runs on August 3 when Daryl Spencer of the San Francisco Giants slid hard into Roach at second base, badly injuring Roach's left knee. He underwent surgery, missing the remainder of 1958 (and the 1958 World Series), and the first two months of the campaign. Although the knee injury didn't end Roach's career, as had been initially feared, his diminished infield range damaged his chances of regular second base duty.

It was stationed at Ali Air Base, Iraq, until the closure of the base on 16 December 2011. It was activated as part of the 332d Air Expeditionary Wing due to Military intervention against ISIL at Ali Al Salem Air Base, Kuwait, and Ahmad al-Jaber Air Base, Kuwait. The 407 AEG provided air operations support for coalition air dominance, battlespace control, and security to advance the stabilization of southern Iraq. It provides coalition tactical airlift support with aerial port operations. The 407 AEG was the first Air Force unit to stand up combat operations within Iraq during Operation Iraqi Freedom.

Its subordinate squadrons at that time included the 632d, 633d, 634th and 635th Bombardment (Dive) Squadrons. The air echelon was attached to Eleventh Air Force in Amchitka, Alaska, from 19 July to 15 August 1943, where it performed combat operations against the Japanese in the Aleutian Islands. The 407th was redesignated the 407th Fighter-Bomber Group on 15 August 1943. At that time, the 632d, 633d and 634th were redesignated the 515th, 516th and 517th Fighter- Bomber Squadrons, respectively, and the 635th was disbanded. In 1943, the 407th flew the Douglas A-24 Banshee dive bombers; North American A-36 Invader dive bombers, P-51D Mustangs, and the P-47 Thunderbolt from 1943 to 1944 as part of the Army Air Forces School of Applied Tactics. In October 1943 the group moved the Lakeland Army Airfield, Florida, and then to Galveston Army Airfield, Texas in November where it trained for combat, and functioned as a replacement unit until 1 April 1944, when it was disestablished. ===Strategic Air Command=== Emblem of the 407th Strategic Fighter Wing (SAC) Republic RF-84K-20-RE Thunderflash 52-7265, 91st SRS, 1955 Flight of four 407th SFW RF-84F Thunderstreaks, Great Falls AFB, Montana, 1955 407th SFW F-84F Thunderstreak 52-7043, Great Falls AFB, Montana, 1955 The 407th was reactivated as the Strategic Air Command 407th Strategic Fighter Wing at Great Falls AFB, Montana in 1953. While it was established on 23 March 1953 it was not activated until 18 December 1953. The wing was assigned to the Fifteenth Air Force and composed of the 407th Air Refueling Squadron with KB-29 Superfortress tankers and the 515th, 516th and 517th Strategic Fighter Squadrons, equipped with the Republic F-84G Thunderjet. Also assigned to the wing in \\"attached\\" status was the 91st Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron (20 December 1954 ‚Äì 17 July 1955) with RF-84Ks. In 1955 KC-97s replaced the KB-29s. Delays in delivery of the F-84Gs to the wing led to operational training not commencing until June 1954. Once operational, from August to November 1954, the 407th deployed to Misawa Air Base, Japan, where it provided air defense of northern Japan. In doing so, from 8 August to 10 November 1954 it was attached to the 39th Air Division (Defense). Returning to the United States, the wing sent its straight-winged F-84Gs to AMARC, and was re-equipped with newer and faster swept-wing F-84F Thunderstreaks. From Great Falls, the 407th provided long-range fighter escort and refueling for B-36 Peacemaker and B-50 Superfortress bombers. The wing had a short life, as the strategic fighter doctrine was phased out of use beginning in 1956. The 407th SFW was inactivated on 1 July 1957. ===Twenty-first century=== The 407th was redesignated the 407th Air Expeditionary Group and later activated at Tallil Air Base (known as Ali Base), Iraq, on 14 April 2003 as a subordinate to the 332d Air Expeditionary Wing, which was stationed at Al Jaber AB, Kuwait. Throughout the summer of 2003, the mission at Ali Base (Tallil AB) expanded. The flightline became home to A-10s, C-130s and Predators. The 332d AEW then transferred from Al Jaber AB, Kuwait, to Ali Base on 5 August 2003. During that period, the wing's A-10s destroyed more than 1,100 targets during major combat operations of Operation Iraqi Freedom. It was also here that U.S. Special Forces staged and planned the rescue of Army Private 1st Class Jessica Lynch, and where the private was flown out of Iraq. In addition to its operational commitments, the 407 AEG was the Senior Airfield Authority at Ali Air Base, and was responsible for the defense, control, operations and maintenance of the airfield, land and facilities whose proximity affected airfield operations Ali Air Base was fully vacated by all U.S. Forces on 16 December 2011, and the 407th AEG was inactivated.

He was one of the founding members of the Association of Americans and Canadians in Israel (AACI), wherein he later served as executive director. Under his directorship, the AACI flourished; Greenfield pioneered and established loan funds, a mortgage company, and a variety of housing projects in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, and kibbutzim. Greenfield was always involved in public service, but the cause to which he dedicated the most time to was rescuing Ethiopian Jewry; he was volunteer director for seven years of the American Association for Ethiopian Jewry (AAEJ). In 1981, Greenfield founded Gefen Publishing House, later taken over by his sons, Dror and Ilan. After Dror‚Äôs passing in 2003, Ilan continued to run the company.

Blackburn included England internationals, Fred Hargreaves and his brother, John, and Jimmy Brown. The Old Boys dominated the early stages of the match but Rovers defended well until, according to the match report in Gibbons' \\"Association Football in Victorian England\\", \\"following an expert through ball by Dunn, Macaulay steered the ball between the Blackburn goalposts to secure a well-deserved half-time lead\\". However, a tribute in The Times (1937) states Macaulay was fond of recalling he outpaced the Blackburn players and helped towards the goal, without claiming to have scored it. Other reports identify the scorer differently: Bell's Life in London, The Field and The Times stated it was Anderson, the first two detailing the ball had been successively passed to him by Macaulay and Dunn, while The Sporting Life stated the ball was centred \\"to the front of the posts\\" by Novelli before it was kicked \\"out of a brief and loose bully\\" (i.e. a scrimmage) by an unnamed player.Warsop, writing later than Gibbons, names Anderson as the definite scorer in the match summary on page 52. Also varied is the time at which the goal was reportedly scored: eight minutes from the start by Bell's Life, ten minutes by The Sportsman, and \\"a quarter of an hour's play\\" by The Sporting Life.Warsop considers eight minutes the official time in match summary on page 52. The Old Etonians were able to prevent Blackburn from scoring in the second half, thus claiming the cup for the second time in three years. ==Match details== { width=92% -   } { style=\\"width:100%\\" - style=\\"vertical-align:top;width:40%\\" { style=\\"font-size:90%\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" - !width=\\"25\\" !!width=\\"25\\" - GK  John Rawlinson - DF   Thomas French - DF   Percy de Paravicini - MF   Hon Arthur Kinnaird - MF   Charles Foley - MF   Philip Novelli - FW   Arthur Dunn - FW   Reginald Macaulay - FW  Harry Goodhart - FW   John Barrington Chevallier - FW   William Anderson } valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"50%\\" { cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" style=\\"font-size:90%;margin:auto\\" - !width=\\"25\\" !!width=\\"25\\" - - GK   Roger Howarth - DF   Hugh McIntyre - DF   Fergus Suter - MF   Fred Hargreaves - MF   Harold Sharples - MF   John Hargreaves - FW   Geoffrey Avery - FW   James Brown - FW   Thomas Strachan - FW   Jimmy Douglas - FW   John Duckworth - } } ==Aftermath== In May 2013 a programme from the game sold at auction at Sotheby's for ¬£35,250, a world record for a football programme. ==Bibliography== *\\"The Association Challenge Cup-Final Tie\\", Manchester Guardian, 27 March 1882 ==References== 1882 Category:1881‚Äì82 in English football Category:1882 in London Category:Blackburn Rovers F.C. matches Category:March 1882 sports events ","title":"1882 FA Cup Final"},{"id":"9108020","text":"The Kumho BMW Championship is a single make racing series based in the UK. Exclusively for BMWs, the championship is run by the BMW Racing Drivers Club in conjunction with the British Automobile Racing Club (BARC). The championship is a BARC registered, BMW-exclusive motorsport series. ==Introduction== The Championship is open to any production BMW sold in the UK. It provides close competition in four classes split by a power-to-weight ratio. The aim of the championship is to provide a closely competitive series for drivers, having a low cost entry class where cars can be competitive running standard engines, and a ladder of increasing cost and performance accommodating the latest vehicles. In 2009, 46 contenders scored points in the championship with the race victories shared between 9 drivers across the four classes. ==History== The BMW Car Club Championship was started in 1987 by husband and wife team, John and Linda McVicker. The Championship was an amateur club series, for BMW owners who wished to race their BMW's at all the national circuits in the UK. The championship was open to all types of BMW from 2002s to CSLs, Bat Mobiles, new or old. The first race meeting took place on a cold and overcast Saturday at Silverstone where it the club managed to field a full grid. The Championship continued under the BMW Car Club banner until late 1999, where the championship was renamed to the BMW Racing Drivers Club. The championship became the ‚ÄòDrivers Club‚Äô where the all the drivers had a say in how the organisation was run, and it is continues in that fashion to this day. The series is established as one of the fastest road tyred (treaded) championships in the country, but it is not necessary to use the latest models, or to run at the front to be competitive. *The championship has its own driving standards policed by the competitors' own BMW Racing Drivers Club, membership of which is a requirement of entry. This is in an attempt to eliminate the damage caused by modern tactics of blocking, weaving and tapping (or as it used to be known, driving into one another). Do not however think that this makes for a gentle series. Racing is getting ever closer as drivers become confident that these undesirable tactics are removed from the sport, allowing competitors to trust one another to not take out the opposition. Some founder members remain at the club today. These include Evelyne Buanic, Stuart Laws who compete in Class B and the club's president, Trevor Ford. ==The Kumho BMW's Today== 2012 marked the 25th anniversary for the Kumho BMW Championship, and also the 15th Anniversary of successful sponsorship from Kumho Tires. The championship is made up of four classes split by a power-to-weight ratio. There are also a number of strict regulations which all cars must adhere to. These can be viewed here. The championship currently competes at many famous circuits in the UK, including Brands Hatch, Silverstone, Snetterton, Thruxton and Croft. The championship usually has a 14-race calendar, with 7 race weekends being double-headers (two races, one per day). ==Previous Results2010=== Overall Championship Points Table Overall Table Class Points Table Class Table Brands Hatch ...

It was the showpiece match of English football's primary cup competition, the Football Association Challenge Cup (better known as the FA Cup), it was the 13th Cup final. It was the first time that a Scottish team reached the final of the tournament, with Queen's Park knocking out the previous holders of the trophy en route. Both teams received protests from the defeated teams following the semi-final matches, but each were turned down by the Football Association. By the time the match was played, Queen's Park had already been awarded the Scottish Cup after Vale of Leven declined to participate in the final. Prior to the match there were temporary stands built at the Oval as the Pavilion was reserved for members of the Surrey County Cricket Club. There was a record breaking attendance at the match, with between 10,000 and 12,000 fans attending making it the most attended match in London and special trains were laid on by the railways to transport spectators from Lancashire. The final coincided with a Scotland v Wales international match which took place in Glasgow on the same day, with the many Scottish internationals in the Queen's Park team opting play for their club team rather than their country. In the event, Scotland won the international comfortably by a scoreline of 4 goals to 1. Despite Queen's Park entering the match as favourites, it was Blackburn Rovers who won the game by two goals to one with goals from Jimmy Douglas and Jimmy Forrest; Robert M Christie scored for Queen's Park. The Scottish team had a goal disallowed during play, and the referee later said that they had scored once more but as the players did not attempt to claim it, he had not bothered to award it. The two teams met once more in the final of the following FA Cup final in 1885. ==Route to the finalQueen's Park=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;margin- left:1em;float:right\\" !scope=colRound ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:120px;\\" Opposition ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:50px;\\" Score ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:140px;\\" Venue - !scope=row  1st align=\\"left\\" Crewe Alexandra  10‚Äì0 align=\\"left\\" Crewe (a) - !scope=row  2nd align=\\"left\\" Manchester F.C.  15‚Äì0 align=\\"left\\" Glasgow (h) - !scope=row  3rd align=\\"left\\" Oswestry  7‚Äì1 align=\\"left\\" Oswestry (a) - !scope=row  4th align=\\"left\\" Aston Villa  6‚Äì1 align=\\"left\\" Glasgow (h) - !scope=row  Quarter-final align=\\"left\\" Old Westminsters  1‚Äì0 align=\\"left\\" Kennington Oval (a) - !scope=row  Semi-final align=\\"left\\" Blackburn Olympic  4‚Äì1 align=\\"left\\" Nottingham (n) } Queen's Park were invited to compete in the 1883‚Äì84 FA Cup, despite being from Scotland. They had previously been invited on several occasions from the 1871‚Äì72 competition onwards, but ultimately withdrew on each occasion. Their most successful runs had been in both 1871‚Äì72 and 1872‚Äì73 when they reached the semi-final each time before withdrawing. On each occasion since, they had withdrawn from the cup without playing any matches. Queen's 1883‚Äì84 FA Cup campaign began on 6 October 1883 with a 10‚Äì0 victory over Crewe Alexandra in the first round in front of a crowd of 2,000 spectators. The second round saw their first home game, and a 15‚Äì0 victory against Manchester F.C. on 1 December. It was the first time that an English cup match had been played in Scotland, and drew 6,000 fans. However the match was a one-sided affair, with Queen's Park dominating throughout to the extent that their goalkeeper was never required to handle the ball. They defeated the Welsh team from Oswestry in the third round, 7‚Äì1. They were drawn at home against Aston Villa in the fourth round, but the match was called into doubt when it was scheduled to take place on the same date and location as Queen's Park's match against Hibernian F.C. in the Scottish Cup. But Queen's and their Scottish opponents agreed to postpone the match for two weeks. There was a great deal of interest by the spectators from Birmingham, and three special trains were laid on to transport them to Glasgow for the game with more than 1200 of them travelling north of the border. Around 10,000 fans filled the ground where they watched Queen's Park defeat Aston Villa 6‚Äì1. The fifth round was their lowest scoring game of the campaign, where they won away to Old Westminsters 1‚Äì0 at the Kennington Oval in London. In the semi-final they defeated Blackburn Olympic 4‚Äì1 to set up a final against the other Blackburn-based team; the match was played at a neutral venue in Nottingham. Olympic subsequently complained to The Football Association as the crowd invaded the pitch to cause disruption for their team; the complaint was not upheld. ===Blackburn Rovers=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;margin-left:1em;float:right\\" !scope=colRound ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:120px;\\" Opposition ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:50px;\\" Score ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:140px;\\" Venue - !scope=row  1st align=\\"left\\" Southport Central  7‚Äì1 align=\\"left\\" Leamington Street (h) - !scope=row style=\\"text- align:center\\" 2nd align=\\"left\\" South Shore  7‚Äì0 align=\\"left\\" Blackpool (a) - !scope=row  3rd align=\\"left\\" Padiham  3‚Äì0 align=\\"left\\" Leamington Street (h) - !scope=row  4th align=\\"left\\" Staveley  5‚Äì1 align=\\"left\\" Leamington Street (h) - !scope=row  Quarter-final align=\\"left\\" Upton Park  3‚Äì0 align=\\"left\\" West Ham Park (a) - !scope=row style=\\"text- align:center\\" Semi-final align=\\"left\\" Notts County  1‚Äì0 align=\\"left\\" Birmingham (n) } Blackburn Rovers also started their campaign in the first round, where they won their first game at home against Southport Central 7‚Äì1. The second round saw them drawn away to South Shore at Blackpool resulting in a further victory by a margin of 7‚Äì0. They defeated Padiham 3‚Äì0 in the third round, once again at their home ground of Leamington Street, and in the fourth round against Staveley 5‚Äì1 in a match which was dominated by Rovers and in front of a crowd of 3000 spectators. Rovers won once again in an away game against Upton Park at West Ham Park by a scoreline of 3‚Äì0 in the fifth round. The match was more competitive than the scoreline might suggest, as Blackburn were a goal down at half time but won the game after a goal by John Inglis and two by Joe Lofthouse in the second half. At Birmingham in a neutral venue, they defeated Notts County in the semi-final 1‚Äì0. As with Olympic against Queen's Park, Notts also complained of events that took place during their semi-final. They argued that Rovers had illegally fielded Inglis, a player from Glasgow who had played for Glasgow Rangers and was only drafted it to the Blackburn team to improve their cup performance. A letter was produced by Rovers to show that he had been expelled from Rangers because he continued to play for the English team instead. Notts wanted the match to be replayed without Inglis, but the FA did not uphold the complaint. ==Pre-match== Prior to the match, Queen's Park and Blackburn Rovers had met on three occasions; each time the game ended in a draw. Queen's went into the match as the favourites, being the most successful club in Scotland at that point and having developed a style of play involving short passing which was not in use in England. They had been awarded the Scottish Cup earlier in the season after Vale of Leven declined to participate in the final due to illnesses suffered by a number of their players. Blackburn Rovers were seeking to emulate the success of rivals Blackburn Olympic, who were the current holders of the trophy, and the team that Queen's Park defeated in the semi-final. Rovers had previously reached the FA Cup final, in 1882, where they were defeated by Old Etonians. Blackburn trained during the week prior to the game by conducting practise games and going for walks. They departed for the London area by train on the day before the final; a large crowd of local supporters gathered at the train station in Blackburn to wish them well as they left. The team stayed in Richmond the night before the match and made their way into the city at lunchtime on the Saturday. For the second year in succession, special trains were laid on for the final to transport fans down from Blackburn. However, due to issues with the Olympic fans from the previous year destroying tea-rooms at stations on the route, the railway instead closed all refreshment rooms on the line on the day of the match. Additional stands were built at the Oval for the match at both the Gasometre end and on the west side, as the Pavilion was reserved for members of the Surrey County Cricket Club. ==Match== The Kennington Oval (here pictured in 1891), venue for the match The match was refereed by Major Francis Marindin of the Royal Engineers, who was also President of the Football Association. His two umpires were Charles Wollaston of Wanderers and C. Crump of the Birmingham Football Association. According to initial estimates, there were around 10,000 to 12,000 spectators, breaking previous records for attendances in London. This was unexpected, and so there was not enough staff at the stadium to prevent the crowd from rushing through the turnstiles without paying. The weather was described as \\"bright and seasonable\\". Queen's won the coin toss and chose to defend the gasometer end. Rovers kicked off, but play quickly turned in the Scottish team's favour and they made the first two attacks. The work of Inglis and Sowerbutts saw Rovers take control of the match briefly, but Queen's Park were awarded an indirect free kick for handball inside the Blackburn half. The ball was shot straight into the Blackburn net without touching another player, and so no goal was awarded. Rovers quickly gained a corner kick but failed to score. Queen's went on the attack once again, with Christie going on a run but losing possession to Hargreaves. After around 30 minutes of play, Hargreaves passed the ball to his teammate Douglas who went on to score Rovers' first goal. Queen's Park then committed the second handball of the game, giving Rovers a free kick. Brown took the ball up the wing, and centred it towards Forrest, who turned the ball into the back of the Queen's Park goal and put Blackburn two ahead. In response, Queen's Park's attacks on the Blackburn defence increased, and they scored through Christie before half time. Queen's Park took the advantage early on in the second half, and a series of rapid attacks followed the break. The Scottish team were only prevented from scoring in one goal mouth scramble by the teamwork of Arthur and Suter. Rovers appeared to have switched to a defensive posture, and conceded a further corner kick, but nothing came of it as Gow kicked it behind the goal. A further handball just inside the Queen's Park half resulted in a solitary attack for Blackburn, ending in Brown sending the ball over the crossbar. Further attacks Queen's Park followed, but one further attack from Blackburn led to a shot from Brown which many in the crowd thought crossed the line before Gillespie cleared it. Blackburn dominated the final five minutes of the game, and the match ended 2‚Äì1; all three goals were scored in the first half. The medals and trophy had been expected to be awarded by Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany, however due to his death on the day before the final, they were not presented publicly. Instead, Major Marindin handed them over in the dressing rooms. ===Match details=== { width=92% -   } { width=\\"100%\\" valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"50%\\" { style=\\"font-size: 90%\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" colspan=\\"4\\" - !width=\\"25\\" !!width=\\"25\\" !!width=\\"200\\" !! -  GK Herby Arthur -  FB Fergus Suter -  FB Joe Beverley -  HB Hugh McIntyre (c) -  HB Jimmy Forrest -  RW Joe Lofthouse -  RW Jimmy Douglas -  LW John Hargreaves -  LW James Brown -  FW Joe Sowerbutts -  FWJohn Inglis } valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"50%\\" { style=\\"font-size: 90%\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" align=\\"center\\" colspan=\\"4\\" - !width=\\"25\\" !!width=\\"25\\" !!width=\\"200\\" !! -  GK George Gillespie -  FB John Macdonald -  FB Walter Arnott -  HB Charles Campbell (c) -  HB John Gow -  RW William Anderson -  RW William Watt -  FW William Harrower -  FW Dr. John Smith -  LWRobert M Christie -  LWDavid Allan } } Match rules 90 minutes. 30 minutes extra-time if scores are level, at captains' discretion.

Queen's Park would ultimately become the only Scottish club to reach the final of the FA Cup, although they returned the following year where they again faced Blackburn Rovers. Following their victory in the FA Cup final, Blackburn Rovers played Blackburn Olympic in the final of the Lancashire Association Cup where Rovers won once again 2‚Äì1. The 1884 FA Cup was the first of a winning streak for Rovers, with the team retaining the trophy for the following two seasons, by first defeating Queen's Park again in 1885 and then West Bromwich Albion following a replay in 1886. This run was ended in the second round of the 1886-87 FA Cup when Rovers played another Scottish team, Renton. After an initial 2‚Äì2 draw played at Queen's Park's ground at Hampden Park, Renton were victorious in the replay. ==References== ==External links== *Match report at www.fa-cupfinals.co.uk 1884 Category:1883‚Äì84 in English football FA Cup Final Category:Blackburn Rovers F.C. matches Category:Queen's Park F.C. matches Category:1883‚Äì84 in Scottish football Category:March 1884 sports events ","title":"1884 FA Cup Final"},{"id":"9108089","text":"Leslie Roy Marston was an American Bishop of the Free Methodist Church of North America, elected in 1935.

He was the son of St John Hutchinson, KC, and his wife, Mary Barnes,Debrett's Peerage and Baronetage (Kelly's Directories, 2000), p. 869. and was descended from the regicide Colonel John Hutchinson of Owthorpe. Standing as a Labour candidate in the 1945 General Election, he finally entered Parliament as a life peer in 1978, eventually voting with the Liberal Democrats. ==Education== Hutchinson was educated at Stowe School and Magdalen College, Oxford, where he graduated with a Master of Arts in Modern Greats (now called Philosophy, Politics and Economics). ==Career== Hutchinson was called to the Bar in the Middle Temple in 1939 and served in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve during World War II, surviving the torpedoing of the destroyer HMS Kelly in 1941. He was the Labour Party candidate for the constituency of Westminster Abbey at the 1945 general election; he canvassed 10 Downing Street and when informed that the \\"tenant\\" (Prime Minister Winston Churchill) was out of the country, he addressed the staff. He worked on the defence team in the Lady Chatterley trial in 1960 and became a Queen's Counsel in 1961. He was a Bencher, Recorder of Bath and of the Crown Court between 1963‚Äì1988. He also led the defence of the art thief Kempton Bunton in 1965. He led the defence of director Michael Bogdanov in 1982 against a charge of gross indecency in the play The Romans in Britain by Howard Brenton. The private prosecution by Christian morality campaigner Mary Whitehouse was defeated when the chief witness against Bogdanov, Whitehouse's solicitor, Graham Ross-Cornes, revealed under cross-examination that he had been sitting at the back of the theatre when he saw what was claimed to be a penis.Mark Lawson \\"Passion play\\", The Guardian, 28 October 2005 The prosecution withdrew after Hutchinson demonstrated that Ross-Cornes could have witnessed the actor's thumb protruding from his fist and the case was ended after the Attorney-General entered a nolle prosequi. Hutchinson was a member of the Committee on Immigration Appeals and of the Committee on Identification Procedures. Hutchinson was Vice-Chairman of the Arts Council of Great Britain and a Professor of Law at the Royal Academy of Arts. At the Tate Gallery, he was first a trustee and then Chairman. On 16 May 1978, Hutchinson was created a life peer with the title Baron Hutchinson of Lullington, of Lullington in the County of East Sussex. He later took leave of absence from the House of Lords, and on 3 October 2011; he became one of the first two peers to retire from membership under a newly instituted procedure. Following the death of Edward Short, Baron Glenamara, in May 2012, Hutchinson became the oldest living life peer. Hutchinson was four years older than Lord Carrington, who was the oldest sitting member of the House of Lords. ==Personal life== Hutchinson was married first to actress Peggy Ashcroft, between 1940‚Äì1965, with whom he had two children:The Peerage, entry for Lord Hutchinson of Lullington * Hon Eliza Hutchinson (born 1941) * Hon Nicholas St John Hutchinson (born 1946) He later married June Osborn; she died on 26 September 2006.

The band had some difficulties finding a permanent drummer, so a friend of theirs, Johan, filled in as a session drummer. Shortly after that, Robin S√∂rqvist joined the band on bass. Impious recorded their debut demo in the summer of 1995, called Infernal Predomination. Shortly after the recording session, drummer Johan had to quit the band due to lack of time, since he had to do military service. Finding a permanent drummer turned out to be harder than they expected. No drummer was found, so another friend, Marko, filled in, also just as a session drummer. In May 1996 the band recorded their second demo, titled The Suffering, at Los Angered Recording with Andy La Rocque. Shortly after the recording, a permanent drummer was finally found. Ulf Johansson accepted the job and this was the first time the band had a complete lineup. In the summer of 1997, Impious recorded their third demo called Promo '97. This demo never got to be released. At the same recording session, the band covered a Sepultura song for the tribute album Sepulchral Feast. Impious covered the song \\"Inner Self\\". \\"Promo '97\\" resulted in a record deal with Swedish label Black Sun Records, and in December 1997, Impious recorded their debut album, Evilized, in Sunlight Studios with producer Tomas Skogsberg. The album was released in the summer of 1998. In October 1998, the band entered Los Angered Recording once again, but this time to cover a Metallica song for the tribute album Metal Militia III. The song \\"One\\" was covered. In January 2000, the band recorded their second album in Studio Mega with engineer Chris Silver. Unfortunately, it took almost a year for Black Sun to release the album. In the summer of 2000, Impious decided to make drastic line-up changes. Martin, who had always sang and played the guitar, quit playing the guitar to concentrate on vocals. Robin switched from bass to lead guitar. There was now no bass player, so Erik Peterson was asked to join the band, and he accepted. In March 2001, Impious recorded a four-song promo in Studio Mega. The promo was sent to different labels with the intention to get a new deal. Impious then decided to sign a deal with Hammerheart Records. In February 2002, drummer Ulf Johansson left the band, just five weeks before the recording of the new album. Impious hired in Mikael Nor√©n, and in a few weeks he had learned all 10 songs for the new album. In March 2002, the band recorded their third album, The Killer, once again at Studio Mega with Chris Silver. Also an MCD was recorded later that year, including \\"The Deathsquad\\" from the album The Killer, plus a re-recorded version of \\"Extreme Pestilence\\" from Evilized, plus three covers from Metallica, Running Wild and M√∂tley Cr√ºe, along with two songs from their \\"Promo 2001\\". This MCD was released in January 2003 when the band went on a European tour together with Necrophobic and Satariel. In February 2004, Impious paid respect to the fathers of death metal, Possessed, by appearing on the tribute album Seven Gates of Horror together with bands as Cannibal Corpse, Sadistic Intent, Vader, Sinister, Angel Corpse and Amon Amarth. Also in February 2004, Impious signed a worldwide deal with Metal Blade Records. During the time between May and July, Impious recorded their fourth album Hellucinate at Studio Mega, except all vocals and solos which were recorded at Valle Adzic's own Deadline Studio. ==Line-up== *Valle Adzic ‚Äì Guitar *Martin √Ökesson ‚Äì vocals *Robin S√∂rqvist ‚Äì Lead guitar *Mikael Nor√©n ‚Äì drums *Erik Peterson ‚Äì Bass ==Discography== * Infernal Predomination (Demo) ‚Äì 1995 * Let There Be Darkness (Demo) ‚Äì 1995 * The Suffering ‚Äì 1996 * Evilized ‚Äì 1998 * Terror Succeeds ‚Äì 2000 * The Killer ‚Äì 2002 * The Deathsquad EP ‚Äì 2002 * Hellucinate ‚Äì 2004 * Born To Suffer (Compilation) ‚Äì 2004 * Holy Murder Masquerade ‚Äì 2007 * Death Domination ‚Äì 2009 ==External links== * *Official MySpace page Category:Swedish death metal musical groups Category:Swedish thrash metal musical groups Category:Musical groups established in 1994 Category:1994 establishments in Sweden ","title":"Impious"},{"id":"9108276","text":"A Sikh man wearing a turban A Sikh boy wearing a rumƒÅl In Sikhism, kesh (sometimes kes) is the practice of allowing one's hair to grow naturally out of respect for the perfection of God's creation. The practice is one of The Five Kakaars, the outward symbols ordered by Guru Gobind Singh in 1699 as a means to profess the Sikh faith. The hair is combed twice daily with a kanga, another of the five Ks, and tied into a simple knot known as a joora or rishi knot. This knot of hair is usually held in place with the kanga and covered by a turban. The 52 commands of Guru Gobind Singh written at Hazur Sahib at Nanded in the state of Maharashtra, mention that the kesh (hair) should be revered as the form of the Satguru (eternal guru) whom they consider as the same as god. For this reason by practitioners they are kept with the utmost respect. This includes regular maintenance of hair which includes but is not limited to combing at least twice daily, washing regularly and not allowing for public touching. ==Significance== Kesh is a symbol of devotion to God, reminding Sikhs that they should obey the will of God. Bhai Nand Lal, who was a well respected poet in the court of the 10th Guru, Guru Gobind Singh, wrote in Persian : > NishƒÅn-e-Sikhƒ´ ast ƒ´n Panj harf-e kƒÅf, Hargiz na bƒÅshad azƒ´n panj muƒÅf, > Kara, Karad, Kacha, Kanga bidƒÅn, Bina kesh hƒìch ast jumla nishƒÅn. [These five letters of K are emblems of Sikhism. These five are most incumbent; Steel bangle, big knife, shorts and a comb; Without unshorn hair the other four are of no significance.] By not cutting hair, Sikhs honour God's gift of hair. Kesh combined with the combing of hair using a kangha shows respect for God and all of his gifts. So important is Kesh that during the persecution of Sikhs under the Mughal Empire, followers were willing to face death rather than shave or cut their hair to disguise themselves. The people are devout; not cutting their hair is/has been an emblem of their goodwill. ==Modern trend== A Sikh boy wearing a patka In modern times the trend of short hair has encroached upon this tradition. It is estimated that half of India's Sikh men have abandoned the turban and cut their hair. Reasons include simple convenience (avoiding the daily combing and tying), because their parents cut their hair and they decided to get their hair cut as well, and social pressure from the mainstream culture to adjust their appearance to fit the norm.Young Men Get Haircuts, Annoying Their Elders.

Balbir Singh Sodhi, a Sikh living in Mesa, Arizona, was shot to death on September 16, 2001, when he was mistaken for a Muslim. In 2007, an 18-year-old Pakistani, Umair Ahmed, forcibly cut the hair of a 15-year-old Sikh boy Harpal Vacher in a US school. In 2008, he was convicted by the jury of \\"second-degree menacing as a hate crime, second-degree coercion as a hate crime, fourth-degree criminal possession of a weapon, and third-degree harassment,\\"Pakistani faces 4 years in jail for cutting Sikh's hair and was sentenced to probation, community service, and completion of a tolerance program.Elmhurst teen avoids jail for cutting off Sikh‚Äôs hair In 2009, Resham Singh, a Punjabi student in Melbourne, Australia, was attacked by a group of teenagers who tried to remove his turban and cut his hair. In 2010, Basant Singh, a Sikh youth in Penang, Malaysia woke up discovering his hair was cut by 50 cm when he was asleep in his dormitory while serving the Malaysian National Service Training Programme. The incident traumatised the youth and is under probe ordered by the Defense Ministry.

A soldier of Italy's Folgore Brigade. 1st Paratroopers Carabinieri Regiment \\"Tuscania\\", also from Italy. The maroon beret in a military configuration has been an international symbol of airborne forces since the Second World War. It was first officially introduced by the British Army in 1942, at the direction of Major-General Frederick \\"Boy\\" Browning, commander of the British 1st Airborne Division. It was first worn by the Parachute Regiment in action in North Africa during November 1942. Although coloured maroon, the beret of the British Parachute Regiment is often called the \\"red beret.\\" ==Origins== The first British army unit to adopt the beret was the Armoured Corps in 1924 (for more information see black beret). During World War II some British Army units followed the lead of the Armoured Corps and adopted the beret as a practical headgear, for soldiers who needed a hat that could be worn in confined areas, slept in and could be stowed in a small space when they wore steel helmets. A popular story is that the maroon colour was chosen by Major-General Frederick Browning, after his wife, Daphne du Maurier, suggested that he use the colour which made up part of his horse racing colours. However, in a letter, now in the British Airborne Assault Archive, she wrote that it was untrue. Whatever its origin, the maroon beret was adopted by the British paratroopers in July 1942. Initially it was adorned with an Army Air Corps badge. This was replaced with the Parachute Regiment badge in 1943. It was during the Western Desert Campaign (1940‚Äì1943) that the Germans in the Africa Korps began to refer to members of the British Parachute Brigade as Rote Teufel (Red Devils) after their maroon berets and their fighting skills. ==Afghan Armed Forces== Afghan National Army commandos The maroon beret is worn by members of the Afghan National Army Commando Brigade. ==Austrian Armed Forces== The maroon beret is worn by all members of the 25th (Airborne) Infantry Battalion (J√§gerbataillon 25) of the Austrian Armed Forces (Bundesheer), which is a mixed airborne/air assault unit.

In addition, the Austrian coat of arms is only used as cap badge until the successful completion of the basic selection course (Jagdkommandogrundkurs), after which Jagdkommando members wear a cloth version of the Kommandoabzeichen (=\\"commando badge\\"). ==Australian Army== Maroon (also referred to as Dull Cherry) berets were worn by parachute qualified members of the 3 RAR Parachute Battalion Group from 1985 ‚Äì 2012, when the parachute role was performed by 3 RAR.

It featured non- volatile magnetic core memory and was housed in a heavy-duty metal cube-shaped box which was designed to fit through a 25-inch circular hatch. In 1972, in response to the proliferation of small computer types in the Navy's inventory, the Chief of Naval Material mandated the use of the AN/UYK-20(V) in systems requiring a small digital processor.\\"HISTORY OF THE AN/UYK-20(V) DATA PROCESSING SYSTEM ACQUISITION AND ITS IMPACT ON TACTICAL SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT,\\" US Navy Document# NPS-36J876091, September 1976 On March 27, 1974 the AN/UYK-20 received service approval and by late 1974 they were in use in the development of tactical systems. Programmers and operators colloquially referred to this computer as the \\"Yuck Twenty.\\" In addition to various uses throughout the fleet, the system was used to train the U.S. Navy's Data Systems Technicians (DS) on digital computer theory and application. The 9-month course had 4 phases and phase 3 was UYK-20. Phase 3 was broken into the following sections: *Microinstructions *Macroinstructions *Processor/Emulator *Memory *Input/Output *Graded Troubleshooting (Mids)- MIDS was the last week of Phase 3 where as the class started at 2300 hours and finished at 0630. Each night a series of faults was inserted into the UYK-20 for troubleshooting purposes. The student had to use diagnostic routines, troubleshooting techniques, and skill to find and fix the faults. The student had to pass with a majority of faults identified and fixed to move on to phase 4. Phase 3 for some was the toughest part of Data Systems A School at Mare Island, CA. I know this, because I attended A School as a DS from SEP 89 - MAY 90. Phase 2 used the training computer called the COMTRAN 10 aka \\"Comtrash 10\\". After the dissolution of the Navy's DS rate, the primary maintenance responsibility was moved to the Electronic Technicians (ET), as the UYK-20 was already being used in several of their systems primarily the NAVMACS system. The AN/UYK-20 is still currently in use, but has been largely supplanted by the AN/UYK-44, which uses a 'superset' of the UYK-20 instruction set, meaning the UYK-44 will execute all of the UYK-20 instructions, as well as several new instructions specific to the UYK-44. ==See also== * AN/AYK-14 * AN/UYK-44 * CMS-2 programming language == References == == External links == *AN/UYK-20 drawing *AN/UYK-20 photograph *Sperry Univac AN/UYK-20 Technical Description Category:UNIVAC hardware Category:Military computers Category:Military electronics of the United States ","title":"AN/UYK-20"},{"id":"9108375","text":"Namul () refers to either a variety of edible grass or leaves or seasoned herbal dishes made of them. Wild greens are called san-namul (, \\"mountain namul\\"), and spring vegetables are called bom-namul (, \\"spring namul\\"). On the day of Daeboreum, the first full moon of the year, Koreans eat boreum-namul (, \\"full moon namul\\") with five-grain rice. It is believed that boreum namuls eaten in winter help one to withstand the heat of the summer to come. == Preparation and serving == bap (cooked rice), guk (soup), kimchi, pyeonyuk (meat slices), and three namul banchans (spinach namul, brakenfern namul, and balloon flower root namul) For namul as a dish, virtually any type of vegetable, herb, or green can be used, and the ingredient includes roots, leaves, stems, seeds, sprouts, petals, and fruits. Some seaweeds and mushrooms, and even animal products such as beef tendons are also made into namuls. Although in most cases the vegetables (and non-vegetable namul ingredients) are blanched before being seasoned, the method of preparation can also vary; they may be served fresh (raw), boiled, fried, saut√©ed, fermented, dried, or steamed. Namul can be seasoned with salt, vinegar, sesame oil and perilla oil, regular soy sauce and soup soy sauce, doenjang (soybean paste), gochujang, and many other spices and condiments. Namul are typically served as banchan (Î∞òÏ∞¨, a side dish accompanying the staples, usually bap). It is possible to have more than one type of namul served as a banchan at a single meal. Each namul dish may named depending on the main ingredients and the methods of preparation. For example, a seasoned chamnamul dish is most likely called chamnamulmuchim (literally \\"seasoned chamnamul\\"), since the name of the vegetable already contains the word \\"namul\\" in it. A namul dish made of raw radish is called musaengchae (\\"Î¨¥ÏÉùÏ±Ñ, seasoned raw radish\\"), since it is usually the namul dish made with cooked radish that is called munamul (\\"radish namul\\"). == Main ingredients of namul  Vegetables = Seaweeds = Mushrooms = Others === ==Gallery== File:Bangpung (Peucedanum japonicum).jpgbangpung-namul File:Chamnamul muchim (Pimpinella brachycarpa).jpgChamnamul File:Korean cuisine-Namul-06.jpgChwinamul File:Korean cuisine-Namul-03.jpgGoguma-sun-namul File:Gondre.jpgGondre-namul File:Gosari.jpgGosari-namul File:Kongnamul muchim (soybean sprouts).jpgKongnamul File:Miyeokmuchim.jpgMiyeok-namul File:Paraemuchim (seasoned parae) (Monostroma nitidum).jpgParae-namul File:Korean cuisine- Pyogo namul-01.jpgPyogo-namul File:Sigeumchinamul (seasoned spinach side dish).jpgSigeumchi-namul File:Korean cuisine-Sukjunamul-01.jpgSukjunamul File:Sebalnamul (Spergularia marina).jpgSebalnamul File:Totmuchim (tot with tofu and doenjang).jpgTot-namul File:Doraji-namul.jpgDoraji-namul File:Ssukgat-namul.jpgSsukgat-namul File:Siraegi-namul.jpgSiraegi-namul File:Korean food-Bibim ssambap ingredient-01.jpgVarious namuls for bibimbap File:Korea-Sokcho-Sanchae jeongsik-Namul-01.jpgSanchae table d'h√¥te == See also == * Sansai * Saag ==References== ==External links== *Life in Korea: Korean seasoned vegetables Category:Korean cuisine ","title":"Namul"},{"id":"9108380","text":"Peter Benson (born 1956)\\"Peter Benson ‚Äì About the Author\\", Foyles. is the author of novels, plays and short stories, and has been described by the London Evening Standard as having \\"one of the most distinctive voices in modern British fiction\\".

With the treaty, Mestwin gave some of his possessions to the margraves, and had them returned as a fief. Excluded from the return was the Bia≈Çogard (Belgard) area, including ≈öwiecie (Schwetz), which remained under direct Brandenburgian rule. In turn the margraves financed the duke, e.g. for the marriage of Mestwin's daughter Catherine with Pribislaw II of Parchim-Richtenberg (part of Mecklenburg). Through this treaty, Brandenburg gained direct access to the Baltic Sea. The signing of the treaty provoked a rebellion by the nobility of the region who were opposed to the Brandenburgians. Likewise, Mestwin's brother Warcis≈Çaw of Gda≈Ñsk (Danzig), and his uncle, Sambor II took the opportunity to try and depose Mestwin. However, Warcis≈Çaw died in 1270 while Sambor was defeated with the help of the Polish duke Boles≈Çaw the Pious. In 1273 Mestwin found himself in open conflict against the margraves who refused to remove their troops from Gda≈Ñsk, Mestwin's possession, which he had been forced to temporarily lease to them during his struggles against Warcis≈Çaw and Sambor. Since the lease had now expired, through this action, the Margrave Conrad broke the treaty and subsequent agreements, in the hopes of capturing as much of Mestwin's Pomeralia as possible. Mestwin, unable to dislodge the Brandenburgian troops himself called in the aid of Boles≈Çaw the Pious, whose troops took the city with a direct attack. The war against Brandenburg ended in 1273 with a treaty (possibly signed at Drawno Bridge), in which Brandenburg returned Gda≈Ñsk to Mestwin while he rendered feudal homage to the margraves for the Lands of Schlawe and Stolp. In a subsequent treaty of 1282, the Treaty of Kƒôpno signed with the Polish duke (later, king) Przemys≈Ç II, Mestwin transferred the suzerainty over all of Pomeralia and Gda≈Ñsk Pomerania, including S≈Çupsk (Stolp) and S≈Çawno (Schlawe) to Poland. Przemys≈Ç took control over the area but was murdered by agents of Brandenburg in 1296.

The chain closed in 1999. ==History== Steinbach was originally founded in 1870 by the Steinbach brothers, John, Henry, and Jacob in Long Branch. The brothers expanded to the Asbury location four years later. In the early 20th century, Steinbach's was considered to be the \\"world's largest department store.\\" The company was at one time affiliated with the Kresge-Newark department store in downtown Newark. In the 1960s, the chain was purchased by Supermarkets General Corporation (SGC), and continued to operate as a standalone company. SGC also purchased the Howland chain in Bridgeport, Connecticut (which had previously merged the Genung's chain of stores into itself), along with the two-store Goerke's department store based in Elizabeth, New Jersey. Howland also continued to run as a stand-alone chain, while the Goerke's stores became part of the Steinbach chain, and in turn were rebranded Steinbach. In the 1970s, the chain opened three full line branches at shopping mall locations along the growing Jersey shore, including the chain's largest, a unit at the Shore Mall near Atlantic City. In 1976, a fourth mall location was opened at the Seaview Square Mall, near its downtown Asbury Park store. The Seaview Square location was opened as the chain's most upscale store, and a number of departments were originally not part of the merchandise mix. This changed when the downtown Asbury Park location was closed in 1979, and Seaview Square was modified to include all departments that were carried at the former downtown store. The Asbury Park location burned town in 1989. ==Ownership changes== In the late 1970s, SGC merged the two chains together under the corporate name Howland- Steinbach. Each chain retained its original name, but were operated by a single corporate office. SGC sold the chain the 1980s to Netherlands-based Amcena Corporation, the owners of the New York City-based Ohrbach's chain. Amcena in turn converted most of its Ohrbach's stores to Steinbach stores. The parent company also converted all of the former Howland stores to the Steinbach nameplate, and closed the former Ohrbach's flagship location in New York. By the late 1980s, Amcena opted to sell the chain, Value City purchased some of the stores, and Detroit based Crowley Milner and Company purchased some others. The chain was liquidated with the rest of Crowley Milner in 1999. ==Flagship store== Steinbach flagship store following its 1979 closure Steinbach had been a fixture in Asbury Park since the late 19th century, and by the turn of the 20th century, a new flagship store was planned and built on Cookman Avenue, billed as \\"The world's largest resort department store.\\" This building initially contained five floors (basement level through fourth floor), and by the 1930s, a fifth floor and clock tower were added. As the Northern sections of the New Jersey shore started to suburbanize, Asbury Park and Steinbach became a focal point. The downtown Steinbach remained popular even after several nearby shopping centers opened, but the race riots during July 1970 cast a shadow over downtown, and shoppers started to avoid the area. Ownership changes also affected Steinbach, and in 1978, Steinbach's then- corporate parent, SGC, opened a new consolidated office building in White Plains, New York to serve as the headquarters for its department store holdings. This cost downtown Asbury Park over 100 jobs, and diminished the role of the downtown building. SGC also refocused Steinbach as a more value- oriented chain. This location, and all future locations, used mahogany wood for all fixtures and showcases. In spring 1979, it was announced that the downtown Steinbach would close after a liquidation sale, with the store's closing on July 14, 1979. The public entrances were padlocked, and the remaining display windows were boarded up. Steinbach continued to use the building as a base for its maintenance staff for a few years, before abandoning the building entirely. In the late 1980s, an arson fire nearly destroyed the entire building, but did result in the removal of the clock tower and fifth floor. Sackman Enterprises, which purchased the building in 2001, announced on March 1, 2007 that the first of 63 apartments was ready for rent following a complete renovation of the building. The ground floor now contains of retail space. The four floors above are loft-style apartments. ==References== ==External links== * Steinbach Building * asburyboardwalk.com History of Asbury Park and the Boardwalk * The Steinbach building at side o' lamb Category:Defunct department stores based in New Jersey Category:Asbury Park, New Jersey Category:Retail companies established in 1936 Category:Retail companies disestablished in 1999 Category:1936 establishments in New Jersey Category:1999 disestablishments in New Jersey ","title":"Steinbach (store)"},{"id":"9108426","text":"The dorsal radioulnar ligament (posterior radioulnar ligament) extends between corresponding surfaces on the dorsal aspect of the distal radioulnar articulation. == References == Category:Ligaments of the upper limb ","title":"Dorsal radioulnar ligament"},{"id":"9108429","text":"The palmar radioulnar ligament (volar radioulnar ligament, anterior radioulnar ligament) is a narrow band of fibers extending from the anterior margin of the ulnar notch of the radius to the front of the head of the ulna.

Motion and gesture file formats are widely used today in many applications that deal with motion and gesture signal. It is the case in domains like motion capture, character animation, gesture analysis, biomechanics, musical gesture interfaces, virtual surgery. Those formats are low-level formats, i.e. formats close to the signal produced by the capture system. ==Existing formats that encode gesture and motionBVA and BVH file formats=== BVH stands for Biovision Hierarchical Data, which was developed by a motion capture company called Biovision. The BVA format (also developed by Biovision) is an older format which was the precursor to BVH. The BVH format is mainly used as a standard representation of movements in the animation of humanoid structures. It is currently one of the most popular motion data formats and has been widely adopted by the animation community (probably because of its simple specifications). ===MNM file format=== This file format allows renaming the segments of a BVH file to match the convention used in Autodesk 3D Studio Max. The name defined by the user is associated to the predefined label for the biped segment. eg. Humerus = L UpperArm This file format also allows renaming the markers of a CSM file to match the convention used in Autodesk 3D Studio Max. A name defined by the user is associated to the predefined label expected by Character Studio. eg. LeftShoulder = LSHO ===MVNX format=== The MVNX format is a human-readable open XML based format for storing Xsens MVN motion capture data. The format contains the 3D positions and orientations of all segments captured with Xsens MVN. In addition, the format includes several other variables to be exported such as joint angles, segment velocity and free acceleration, center of mass trajectory and calibrated sensor data of the individual motion trackers. MVNX data can also be imported into leading software programs including MATLAB and Excel. ===ASK/SDL file format=== The format is a variant of the BVH file format developed by Biovision. The ASK file (Alias Skeleton) only contain information concerning the skeleton and, as a result, does not contain any information about the channels or the movement. The offset coordinates are absolute, unlike the BVH in which they are relative. The SDL file associated to the ASK file contains the data of the movement but it can contain much other information concerning the scene than the very samples of the movement. ===AOA file format=== Adaptative Optics is a company dedicated to the creation of hardware support for the motion capture. This ASCII file format simply describes the captors and their position at each sampling period. ===ASF/AMC file formats=== This format was developed by Acclaim, a video game company. Once entered in the public domain it has been used by Oxford Metrics (Vicon Motion Capture Systems). The Acclaim format is composed of two different files, one for the skeleton and the other one for the movement. The separation between these two types has been done because the same skeleton is often used for numerous distinct movements. The file containing the skeleton description in the ASF file (Acclaim Skeleton File) and the file containing the movement data is the AMC file (Acclaim Motion Capture data). ===BRD file format=== The format is uniquely used by the motion capture system Ascension Technology ‚ÄúFlock of Birds‚Äù developed by LambSoft. It allowed stocking the data coming from a magnetic motion capture system. ===GRC file format=== The GRC file format is file format to store motion capture data from Synertial mocap system. GRC includes RAW data from inertial sensors (such as rotation, acceleration, and magnetic field strength), skeleton details, absolute position of the skeleton root and various metadata (notes, TimeCode, ..). Thanks to the fact that the RAW data from this file are read by Synertial SDK and the skeleton structure is recomputed each time they are needed, the file format is memory efficient. GRC file format data are compatible and can be exported into BVH and FBX file formats using Synertial software tools. ===HTR and GTR file formats=== The HTR format (Hierarchical Translation Rotation) has been developed as a native format for the skeleton of the Motion Analysis software. It has been created as an alternative to the BVH format to make up for its main drawbacks. A HTR variant exist which is called the GTR format (Global Translation Rotation) and is the same format less the structural information. === TAK file format === The Tak, pronounced \\"take,\\" file format is used by the Motive software developed by OptiTrack. The file can contain information on: * Marker position and residual error * Skeleton information and 6DoF Rigid Body position and rotation * Force Plate Data * Auido * General information on capture, like frame rate, calculation properties of markers, camera filters, synchronization method, recording system data/time * SMPTE Timecode * Recorded Camera Data ===TRC file format=== The TRC file format is another file format from Motion Analysis. It contains not only the raw data from the full body motion capture system they developed but also the output data coming from their face tracker. The TRC file format, conversely to most others, is not skeleton-based. ===CSM file format=== The CSM format is an optical tracking format that is used by Character Studio (an animation and skinning plug-in for 3ds Max) for importing marker data. ===V/VSK file format=== The V file format is a binary motion data format developed by Vicon Motion Systems. This file is normally used in conjunction with a VSK file also developed by Vicon Motion System. The VSK file contains the skeleton Hierarchy. The V file can contain the following data: \\\\- Marker data \\\\- Global segment translation and rotation data \\\\- Local rotation data (with root translation data) ===C3D file format=== The C3D file format is a public domain, binary file format developed in the mid-1980s at The National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. It stores 3D coordinate information, analog data and associated information used in 3D motion data capture and subsequent analysis operations. At the time of its development all 3D motion capture systems stored their data in multiple files, each with a different proprietary format, making the exchange of data between various biomechanics and gait analysis laboratories very difficult. With the introduction and adoption of the C3D file format by all major 3D motion capture companies all necessary 3D information, analog data and parameters describing the data can be seamlessly transferred between researchers and laboratories, regardless of the hardware or environment used to collect the data. The major features of the C3D file format are listed below: * The ability to store 3D positional and analog data in both processed and unprocessed form. * Store information describing the physical design of the laboratory such as EMG channels used, force plate positions, and marker sets, etc. * Store Trial information relating to the circumstances of the test session such as sample rates, filenames, dates, EMG muscles recorded, etc. * Store subject information e.g. ID, age at trial, with physical parameters such as weight, leg length, etc. * Store calculated analysis results such as gait timing, cycle information and related information. * Extensibility - the C3D format provides the ability to store new information without making older data obsolete. * The public specification and description of the C3D format allows anyone to access data without depending on a manufacturer for information. Prior to the introduction of the C3D file format almost all biomechanics and gait analysis software was written for each specific 3D system manufacturers file format. As a result, researchers and clinicians were restricted to either writing their own analysis software or else using only the software provided by with their 3D data collection system. The introduction of the C3D format resulted in the availability of a substantial body of third-party software and freed the research community from dependence on any individual 3D data system manufacturer. The C3D file format, conversely to most others, is not skeleton- based, and is binary. ===GMS file format=== The GMS (Gesture and Motion Signal) format is a low-level, binary, minimal, but generic, format for storing Gesture and Motion Signals in a flexible, organized, optimized way. The GMS format takes into account the minimal features a format carrying movement/gesture information needs: flexible dimensionality for the signals, versatile structuration, flexible types of the encoded variables, and spatial and temporal properties of gesture and motion signals. GMS received the support of the FP6 Network of Excellence IST-2002-002114 ‚Äì \\"Enactive Interfaces\\". The GMS file format, conversely to most others, is NOT skeleton- based, and is binary. ===HDF file format=== A closed binary file format developed by House of Moves for use in their proprietary software called (at the time) Diva.

The Arabic word Fitr means the same as iftar, breaking a fast, and it comes from the same root word as Futoor which means breakfast. Zakat al Fitr is a smaller amount than Zakat al-Mal. ==Classification== Sadaqat al-Fitr is a duty which is wajib (required) of every Muslim, whether male or female, minor or adult as long as they have the means to do so. According to Islamic tradition (Sunnah), Ibn 'Umar said that the Islamic Prophet Muhammad made Zakat al-Fitr compulsory on every slave, freeman, male, female, young and old among the Muslims; one Saa\` of dried dates or one Saa\` of barley. The head of the household may pay the required amount for the other members. Abu Sa'eed al-Khudree said: > On behalf of our young and old, free men and slaves, we used to take out > during Allah's Messenger's (upon whom be God's peace and blessings) lifetime > one Saa\` of grain, cheese or raisins\\". ==Significance== The significant role played by Zakat in the circulation of wealth within the Islamic society is also played by the Sadaqat al-Fitr. However, in the case of Sadaqat al-Fitr, each individual is required to calculate how much charity is due from themselves and their dependents and go into the community in order to find those who deserve such charity. Thus, Sadaqat al-Fitr plays a very important role in the development of the bonds of community. The rich are obliged to come in direct contact with the poor, and the poor are put in contact with the extremely poor. This contact between the various levels of society helps to build real bonds of kinship and love within the Islamic community and trains those who have, to be generous to those who do not have.citation needed ==Purpose== The main purpose of Zakat al-Fitr is to provide the poor which they can celebrate the festival of breaking the fast (\`Eid al-Fitr) along with the rest of the Muslims. Every Muslim is required to pay Zakat al-Fitr at the conclusion of the month of Ramadan as a token of thankfulness to God for having enabled him or her to observe the obligatory fast. Its purpose is: # As a levy on the fasting person. This is based on the hadith: The Prophet of Allah said, \\"The fasting of the month of fasting will be hanging between earth and heavens and it will not be raised up to the Divine Presence without paying the Zakat al-Fitr.\\" # To purify those who fast from any indecent act or speech and to help the poor and needy. The latter view is based upon the hadith from Ibn \`Abbas who related, ‚ÄúThe Prophet of Allah enjoined Zakat al-Fitr on those who fast to shield them from any indecent act or speech, and for the purpose of providing food for the needy. It is accepted as Zakah for the one who pays it before the \`Eid prayer, and it is sadaqah for the one who pays it after the prayer.‚Äù[Abu Dawood - Eng. transl. vol. 2, p. 421, no. 1605 - rated Sahih] ==Conditions== Zakat al-Fitr is Wajib and must be distributed during a particular period of time. If one misses the time period without a good reason, they have sinned and must make it up. This form of charity becomes obligatory from sunset on the last day of fasting and remains obligatory until the beginning of Eid prayer (i.e., shortly after sunrise on the following day). However, it can be paid prior to the above-mentioned period, as many of the Sahabah (companions of the Prophet) used to pay Sadaqah al-Fitr a couple days before the \`Eid. After the spread of Islam the jurists permitted its payment from the beginning and middle of Ramadan so as to ensure that the Zakat al-Fitr reached its beneficiaries on the day of \`Eid. It is particularly emphasized that the distribution be before the \`Eid prayers in order that the needy who receive are able to use the fitr to provide for their dependents on the day of \`Eid. Nafi\` reported that the Prophet's companion Ibn 'Umar used to give it to those who would accept it and the people used to give it a day or two before the \`Eid. [Bukhari - Arabic/English, Vol. 2, p.339, no. 579] Ibn 'Umar reported that the Prophet ordered that it (Zakat al-Fitr) be given before people go to perform the (\`Eid) prayers. One who forgets to pay this Zakat al-Fitr on time should do so as soon as possible even though it will not be counted as Zakat al-Fitr. ==Rate== The amount of Zakat is the same for everyone regardless of their different income brackets. The minimum amount is one sa\` (four double handfuls) of food, grain or dried fruit for each member of the family. This calculation is based on Ibn 'Umar's report that the Prophet made Zakat al-Fitr compulsory and payable by a sa\` of dried dates or a sa\` of barley. The Hanafi school permits paying Zakat al-Fitr in the form of cash, equivalent to the above amount, while this is not permitted Maliki, Shafi'i and Hanbali schools. Using cash as a form of payment became the adopted position by many official fataw councils around the world. A companion of Mohammed, Abu Sa\`eed al- Khudree said, \\"In the Prophet's time, we used to give it (Zakatal-Fitr) as a sa\` of food, dried dates, barley, raisins or dried cheese\\".[Bukhari - Arabic/English vol. 2, p. 340, no. 582] (According to the majority of Sunni scholars One Sa'a is approximately between 2.6 kg to 3 kg.) The distribution of Zakat al-Fitr is the same as that of Zakah, and is included within its broader sense. Those who may receive Zakat al-Fitr are the eight categories of recipients mentioned in Surat Al-Tawbah, [9: 60]. They include: # the poor, # the needy, # collectors of Zakah, # reconciliation of hearts, # freeing captives / slaves (fee al-Riqab), # debtors, # those fighting for a religious cause or a cause of God (Fƒ´ Sabƒ´lillƒÅh) or for Jihad in the way of Allah,T.W. Juynboll, Handleiding tot de Kennis van de Mohaamedaansche Wet volgens de Leer der Sjafiitische School, 3rd Edition, Brill Academic, pp. 85‚Äì88 # the traveler. Zakat al-Fitr must go to the above-mentioned categories. The Zakat al-mal cannot be used for any other such things either. ==References== ==External links== * Zakaah al-Fitr * Zakat al Fitr * Zakat al-Fitr Book * The divergence concerning the validity of payment of the zakat ul fitr in money (at-tawhid.net) * About Saa\` in Arabic Wikipedia * Zakat al Fitr - Zakat Fitrah Category:Ramadan Category:Zakat Category:Islamic terminology ","title":"Zakat al-Fitr"},{"id":"9108502","text":"Pan Yue (; born April 1960) is executive vice president of the Central Academy of Socialism in Beijing (rank equivalent of minister).

Born in Hitchin, Hertfordshire, Blindell was first elected as the constituency's MP at a by- election in March 1929, caused by the death of the Conservative MP Arthur Dean. At the time he was managing director of a boot manufacturing business. Blindell overturned a Conservative majority of nearly 5,000 to win with a majority of 3,706. His victory was the last Liberal by-election gain until Torrington in 1958. Blindell was re-elected as a Liberal at the 1929 general election, but in 1931 he was one of the Liberal MPs who broke with their party to support Ramsay MacDonald's National Government, eventually forming the National Liberal Party. He was re-elected as a National Liberal at the 1931 general election and at the 1935 general election. In both elections, the Conservatives (who also supported the National Government) did not field a candidate against him, and he was returned with large majorities. Blindell was knighted in 1936. He was killed in a car accident in 1937 in Stickford, near Spilsby, Lincolnshire. The car overturned when the driver swerved to avoid dogs in the road. Sir James died within five minutes of massive head injuries. Lady Blindell survived the accident with minor injuries.

The man's mouth is slightly agape giving the impression that he is singing along with the music that the young girl is playing. This suggests that there is a relationship between the two figures and the idea of love and music being bridged together. This was a common theme among Netherlandish art in this time period. Vermeer consistently used the same objects within his paintings such as the draped rug, the white water jug, various instruments, tiled floor and windows that convey light and shadows. This is one of few paintings produced by Vermeer which were kept in his home until his death in 1675 when his family was forced to sell them. It became a part of the Royal Collection, and it is currently on display in the Picture Gallery at Buckingham Palace in London. ==Provenance== The picture was sold in May 1696 in Delft, part of the collection of Jacob Dissous, which included many Vermeers. It was later acquired by Venetian artist Giovanni Antonio Pellegrini in 1718, with Pellegrini's collection later being bought by Joseph Smith. The Music Lesson has been part of the Royal Collection of Great Britain since 1762, when King George III bought Smith's collection of paintings. When the painting was acquired it was believed to be a work by Frans van Mieris the elder because of a misinterpretation of the signature. It was not correctly attributed to Vermeer until 1866 by Th√©ophile Thor√©, though some scholars were skeptical whether it was Vermeer or not. It has at various times been kept at both Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle, and is depicted in Charles Wild's Windsor Castle: the King's Closet, 1816, a watercolour prepared for William Pyne's History of the Royal Residences. ==Painting materials== The painting was investigated by Hermann K√ºhn in 1968Kuhn, H.

Some small off-site facilities of the Cyprus Prisons Department have been declared as prisons, for use when there is a need to keep a prisoner separate from the general population. The Nicosia Central Prison was built by the British in 1894 and was in use until 1955 as a place of detention of those condemned by the courts to imprisonment, but also as a place of temporary detention of persons under judicial decree. During the Turkish invasion of Cyprus (1974) battles raged around the Central Jail of Lefkosia. Vastly outnumbered, the Cypriot national guardsmen - aided by corrections officers - managed to fight off the Turks and keep the prison from being captured. The prison has a mix of single-person cells, cells for two inmates, and larger shared rooms for recreational activities. Prisoners on remand are kept separate from convicted prisoners, and prisoners under 21 and female prisoners have their own blocks. There is a \\"Special Observation Block\\" for prisoners deemed to be at risk of self-harm or other vulnerabilities. The prison is divided into three sections. The Closed Prison is used to house prisoners in high-security conditions. The Open Prison, which is intended for prisoners who have served a quarter to one-third of their sentences and who have shown good conduct, has lax conditions with all prisoners having their own cells. The Guidance Centre for out of Prison Employment and Rehabilitation of Prisoners, which houses prisoners who have shown good conduct and are within twelve months of release, has extremely lax conditions, and prisoners held there work outside the prison.https://www.cyprusnet.com/article/cyprus- prisons- department.htmlhttps://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/684733/Cyprus___Prisoner_Pack.pdfhttp://www.euro- cides.eu/esm2/upload/cyprus_prison_department_general_information.pdf A variety of workshops, kitchens, and a farm exist in the prison, where prisoners work as cooks, tailors, carpenters, electricians, barbers, mechanics, gardeners, and farmers. Unless given a medical exemption or over retirement age, all prisoners are expected to work. Vocational classes are offered to inmates, including approved correspondence courses. The prison has television rooms, gymnasiums, a theatre for live shows performed by prisoners, a church, a mosque, school, library, facilities for football, volleyball, and basketball games, and two visiting areas where family and friends may visit prisoners. The prison has two medical facilities. The prison is also the location of the Imprisoned Graves, where 13 EOKA fighters who lost their lives during the Cyprus Emergency, nine of whom were executed by the British in the prison, three were killed in action, and one died in hospital from battle wounds, are interred. A section of the prison grounds where the Imprisoned Graves are located along with the nearby condemned cells and gallows room where EOKA prisoners condemned to death were held and executed has been converted into a museum open to the public. ==See also== * B√ºy√ºk Han ==References== ==External links== Category:Prisons in Cyprus Category:Buildings and structures in Nicosia ","title":"Central Jail of Nicosia"},{"id":"9108691","text":"Domaslavice may refer to: * Doln√≠ Domaslavice, a village in Fr√Ωdek-M√≠stek District, Czech Republic * Horn√≠ Domaslavice, a village in Fr√Ωdek-M√≠stek District, Czech Republic ","title":"Domaslavice"},{"id":"9108703","text":"Fujiwara no Asatada, from the Ogura Hyakunin Isshu.

Malinauskas was born to a Lithuanian family of nobility and educated in Vilnius. Later he moved to study at the Agricultural Academy in Tabor, Bohemia, where he supported Czech nationalist movements among the student body. After graduation, he returned to the family estate near Trakai and became involved with various political and charitable causes. He was part of a group referred to as one of the \\"Twelve apostles\\". Their objectives included a campaign to allow the use of the Lithuanian language in Roman Catholic services in Lithuania, which at the time required the use of either Latin or Polish, and the establishment of the Lithuanian Central Relief Committee. His work at this Committee led to his election to the Council of Lithuania and the signing of the Act of Independence in 1918. During the Interwar period Malinauskas served as a diplomatic envoy to Czechoslovakia and Estonia. He conducted a search for the remains of Vytautas the Great, going so far as to have a silver coffin constructed in Czechoslovakia to contain these, if and when they were found. The search focused on Vilnius Cathedral, which most historic sources pointed to as the most probable location. Malinauskas was deported to Russia on June 14, 1941.

Such notes may be used when the interpreter is working in \\"consecutive mode.\\" Interpreting notes are not part of any conventional graphic system, and practitioners are free to develop their own techniques. However, some basic rules facilitate the recording of details in order to aid the interpreter in coping with large amounts of information. ==Theory== The purpose of interpreting notes is not to transcribe the speech verbatim. Interpreting notes are not a form of shorthand. Their purpose is to write minimal notes which will, at a quick glance, elicit in the interpreter's mind the intent of an oral communication so that it can be re-expressed in a different language. It is not appropriate to document a speech in shorthand, as this would result in task duplication. ==Practice== Typical interpreting notes. The interpreter should listen with utmost concentration to the speaker and write only the information which he judges sufficient to render the meaning. Numbers, names, and the titles of persons must be retained in the interpretation. Interpreting notes are typically written in a notebook with each note being separated from the others by a horizontal line. After interpreting a sentence with the aid of a note, some interpreters might make a slash over it, if they have the time. This has an important psychological effect ‚Äî it is similar to erasing data on a computer. Others might consider it too time-consuming to do so when a fast pace of interpretation is required or they might think that it detracts from the pace of their delivery. The interpreter is required to decipher his notes and to re-express their content in the target language. Following analysis of the speech, the interpreter may write the information in abstract form. ===Ideograms=== Ideograms are an important tool used by interpreters. For example, the letter ‚ÄúE‚Äù laid on its side (like the Cyrillic letter sha, –®) may represent Europe. Then one can specify whether eastern, western, or central Europe is meant by slashing the relevant upward leg. A horizontal bar with two vertical bars beneath it might represent a table, which would indicate a meeting or a conference. A bracket before an action indicates that the action will take place in the future, and vice versa. These ideograms are linked by a system of arrows and brackets that show the structure of a sentence that is to be interpreted. Using this system, one can note, for instance, that a sum has increased or decreased by a certain percentage (according to the arrow‚Äôs direction). For example, the notes in the illustration might be interpreted to mean : > We are particularly glad to inform you about an important increase in our > company‚Äôs revenues, which rose by 10 percent from 3.5 to 3.85 billion > dollars.(*) This derives from huge sales of helicopters. The United States > of America bought 50 and South Africa 20 of them. On the other hand, we must > relocate parts of our production in these countries. (A billion (bn) is > called a milliard (mrd or Md) in some languages.)* Some interpreters have devised complete systems of abbreviations, which include all academic titles, administrative titles, military ranks, etc. Such a system has the drawback that, like shorthand, it may be useful only for a particular language. ==Bibliography== * Andres, Dorte: Konsekutivdolmetschen und Notation. 2000, *Farwick, Judith: Between the Signs.

Working in Rome, Venice and finally his native Lucca, he was a follower of Caravaggio to whose work he responded in a very personal manner. He founded an Academy in his hometown, which formed the next generation of painters of Lucca.Mark MacDonnell, Pietro Paolini, Portrait of a Young Page at Dorotheum ==Life== Pietro Paolini was born in Lucca, as the youngest son of Tommaso Paolini and Ginevra Raffaelli. His family was well-off as his mother was a descendant of a prominent Lucchese family. The card sharps Paolini‚Äòs father sent his son to Rome to the workshop of Angelo Caroselli when he was 16 years old.Memorie e documenti per servire alla storia di Lucca, Volume VIII, p. 136-143 Angelo Caroselli was a follower of Caravaggio who worked in an eclectic style.Renate M√∂ller. \\"Caroselli, Angelo.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 28 May 2016 Whereas in the past the relationship between Caroselli and Paolini was regarded solely as that of a master and apprentice, more recently discovered materials point to a more complex relationship, more akin to that of collaborators and characterised by the sharing of themes. Caroselli was continuously absent from Rome from June 1616 until February 1623 so it would have been impossible for Caroselli to be Paolini's master. Paolini‚Äôs documented presence in Lucca in 1626, at least for the period June‚ÄìOctober further limits the period of their interaction.Patrizia Giusti Maccari, Pietro Paolini, Pandora at Dorotheum In Caroselli's workshop Pietro Paolini had the opportunity to study the various schools and techniques, which is reflected in the stylistic flexibility of his work. In Rome Paolini was exposed to the influence of the second generation of naturalist painters in the Caravaggesque tradition whose principal representative was Bartolomeo Manfredi and also included Cecco del Caravaggio and Bartolomeo Cavarozzi.Pietro Paolini, 1603 Lucca - 1681, zug., Musikantenpaar, at Hampel Fine Art Auctions Munich The ages of life From c. 1629-1631 he lived for two years in Venice where he had the opportunity to admire the works of Paolo Veronese and Tintoretto. He returned to Lucca, where he lived the remainder of his life. His parents had died in previous years and he needed to support his many siblings. After establishing a successful studio in Lucca he specialised in cabinet pictures often including allegorical or musical subjects and still lifes, a genre which he introduced to the city.Pietro Paolini, The Cardsharps at Jean Luc Baroni Ltd He received multiple commissions from religious institutions in Lucca as well as prominent local citizens. On 25 November 1651 Paolini married Maria Forisportam Angela di Girolamo Massei, by whom he had two sons: Andrea, who became custodian of the Public Archives, and Giovanni Tommaso.Elisabetta Giffi, PAOLINI, Pietro at Dizionario Biografico Around 1652 (or possibly even earlier) Paolini founded the 'Academy of Painting and Drawing of Lucca', at which he helped train many painters. The Academy contributed to a particularly lively artistic environment in Lucca in the second half of the 17th century. Numerous artists, such as Girolamo Scaglia, Simone del Tintore (a still-life painter) and his brothers Francesco and Cassiano, Antonio Franchi, Giovanni Coli and Filippo Gherardi were trained at the Academy.Pietro Paolini, A young lady holding a compass at Sotheby's Pietro Testa may also have been a pupil of Paolini.Rudolf Wittkower, Art and Architecture in Italy: 1600 to 1750,The Pelican History of Art, New York, Viking, 1973, p. 323 Paolini owned a collection of coins and plaster casts taken from ancient models as well as a collection of ancient and modern weapons that were used as models and props in the Academy. Paolini later almost entirely abandoned painting in order to devote himself to teaching.Pietro Paolini, Pittore caravaggesco a Lucca at Finestre sull'Arte He died in Lucca in 1681. ==WorkGeneral=== Allegory of the Five Senses Only two works in Paolini's oeuvre can be dated with any certainty. They are the Mystic Marriage of Saint Catherine signed and dated 1636 and the Birth of Saint John the Baptist commissioned the following year for Santa Maria Corteorlandini. These are both dateable to immediately after the artist's return to Lucca. The rest of his body of work is largely undocumented.Pietro Paolini, called il Lucchese (Lucca 1603-1681), A young man holding bagpipes standing beside a table with a lute, a tambourine and a book of music at Bonhams The principal themes of Paolini's work were the subjects popularized by Caravaggio in Roman painting around the turn of the 17th century. They included depictions of low-class people such as fraudsters, charlatans, hawkers, prostitutes and musicians. He typically only placed a few figures in a scene. Characteristic of Paolini's work are the balanced, simple division of the canvases, the plasticity of the figures, the enigmatically vague expressions, the smooth, radiant complexion of the figures as well as the accuracy in which he rendered materials and objects such as musical instruments. Paolini also painted religious and mythological compositions during his early days and a few ones on commission when he was back in Lucca. These religious compositions form only a small part of his oeuvre.Patrizia Giusti Maccari, Pietro Paolini, 1603/ 1681 at Sacrum Luce An example of a mythological composition is the early work Achilles among the Daughters of Lycomedes (1625-1630, J. Paul Getty Museum). The thesis that Paolini was a painter of still lifes because he was the master of a leading still-life painter like Simone del Tintore is not well supported. In the few compositions in which his hand is clearly recognizable it is clear that Paolini limited his intervention to the figures. ===Allegorical paintings=== A number of his paintings have allegorical meanings such as the Allegory of the Five Senses (The Walters Art Museum). This composition depicts a darkened inn with a number of low-life persons engaged in music making and drinking. Each person is an allegorical representation of one of the five senses. Sound is represented by the woman with a lute, at center; taste, by the man emptying a flask of wine; smell, by the young man with a melon; sight, by the man on the right holding a pair of spectacles; and touch, by the two people who are fighting. This painting dates from his early years in Rome and shows the realism and strong chiaroscuro typical of Caravaggio and his followers.Pietro Paolini, Allegory of the Five Senses at The Walters Art Museum The Concert His works often took direct inspiration from Caravaggio's compositions. Examples are two concert paintings, The Concert (c. 1620-1630, formerly in the J. Paul Getty Museum, Malibu) and the Bacchic Concert (c. 1625-30, Dallas Museum of Art), from his early days in Rome. The two works represent the artist's reaction to Caravaggio's The Musicians, which he may have seen in the collection of Cardinal del Monte. The general features of The Concert and several of its details, such as the still life of the violin and open part- book with an upturned page, are directly derived from Caravaggio's composition. Paolini replaced Caravaggio's androgynous youths in loose-fitting blouses with three women in contemporary dress, one of whom plays a cittern while the others play lutes. The individualized physiognomies suggest portraits and Paolini clearly intended to suggest an actual performance. Portrait of a man Trios of female musicians achieved considerable fame in this period. The inclusion of Cupid, who replaces Caravaggio's self-portrait with a cornetto, shows that the picture was intended as an allegory of Love and Music presented in the guise of an actual concert. This was a common theme in the pictorial tradition of the 16th century, which depicted Love as being born from Music, or Love as always being in the company of Music\\". The red carnation proffered by Cupid to one of the women is a pointed allusion to this relationship between Love and Music. The gesture may also imply that the three women are offering their love to the viewer, a theme of many 16th-century paintings with musical subjects.Keith Christiansen, A Caravaggio Rediscovered, The Lute Player, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1990, p. 24-25 and p. 70-73 ===Portraits=== Paolini created a number of portraits, often with an allegorical meaning and depicting persons engaged in a certain profession or activity. These works are all datable between the third and fourth decades of the 17th century. A young lady holding a compass An example is A young lady holding a compass (At Sotheby's 9 December 2009, London, lot 28). It depicts a young woman holding a compass in her right hand who appears to be drawing geometric designs for an arch on a piece of paper she holds in her left hand. As it was highly unusual at the time to show a woman engaged in architectural design, it has been suggested that the work may be an allegorical portrait representing Architecture. On the other hand, the figure's highly naturalistic physiognomy is rather too specific for an 'allegorical' or 'idealised' portrait. The expression of the model appears observed from a specific person and she is wearing contemporary dress. The blending of the real and the ideal is characteristic of Paolini's male portraiture as well. His Man holding a mask, despite its emblematic overtones, shows a youth whose features are rendered like those of a real person. This blending of fidelity to life and idealisation, the mysterious and fascinating is also present in a group of five oval paintings that date to the first half of the 17th century. They include a Portrait of a Young Page, a Lute Maker, a Violin Maker, an Old Woman Sewing and an Old Woman Spinning. These portraits are genre paintings likely conveying an allegorical meaning on the subject of harmony. Paolini also made a few portraits of actors among which there are two of the actor Tiberio Fiorilli as Scaramouche. Paolini may have met the actor in Rome or in Tuscany when Fiorilli was living there.Gianni Papi, Pietro Paolini (Lucca, 1603 - Lucca, 1681) Portrait of Tiberio Fiorilli as Scaramouche at Michel Descours galerie peintures et dessins ==References== Portrait of Tiberio Fiorilli as Scaramouche ==External links== * Category:1603 births Category:1681 deaths Category:People from Lucca Category:17th-century Italian painters Category:Italian male painters Category:Italian Baroque painters Category:Lucchese painters ","title":"Pietro Paolini"},{"id":"9108902","text":"Gangsters 2: Vendetta is a 2001 PC video game. It was developed by Hothouse Creations, with Eidos Interactive as publishers. Gangsters 2 was designed by both Peter Moreland and Rob Davies. The game is the sequel to Gangsters: Organized Crime also published by Eidos. ==Story== Set from late 1928-early 1929, the game follows a character called 'Joey Bane'. Bane's father is murdered at the beginning by a mob controlling most of the state, with the capital of Temperance (the fictional state where the games are set). The leader of the mob is Frankie 'Hammer' Constantine. Bane is aided by his father's younger brother, who escaped the killings and gives the player advice on how to build an organized crime racket. During the first mission, Bane kills the men who actually murdered his father, only to learn they were pawns in a grander scheme. Bane progresses through the state, building up his power by eliminating gangsters in various communities connected to the killing of his father, as well as forging alliances with gangsters who are also at war with Constantine. ==Style== The game is very heavily a strategy game, utilizing a point and click interface. Each gangster ('hood') the player controls can have four subordinates that will help the character in a firefight. Players can use vehicles to reach targets faster, attempt drive-bys and transport goods. Weapons can be upgraded, including those of your 'hoods'. Business must be bought, sold and taken over from rival gangs, players must set up many types of illegal businesses to make the most money e.g. gambling dens, breweries and brothels. The player is given objectives to fulfill. They range from setting up illegal businesses, claiming the enemies' business, kidnapping, and murder. ==Features== Players can purchase a number of different automobiles, business specialists and other \\"specialists\\" including hitmen. There are five different cars for purchase as well as a range of guns: revolver, dual pistols, rifle, shotgun and the tommy gun. Bombs can also be purchased, but only by a gangster with the bomb skill. Skills can be leveled up before starting each mission, by a limited amount, from leveling your hoods combat or stealth skill, to their special abilities, unique to each hood. There is bombing, bank robbing, getaway driving, or kidnapping skills. You can also level up Specialists's business skill, increasing their profits. ==End Scenes== The game was noted for having end scenes for cases of losing. Icons dependent on the game's outcome would then be placed in the high score section dependent on the losing scene, with the exception of a \\"Victory\\" icon should the player win the game. *Execution: Bane is sent to the electric chair if the player is arrested and the crimes committed are acute enough to warrant a death sentence. *Death: If the player is killed by rival gangsters, Bane's tombstone is shown in a thunder and lightning storm. *Imprisonment: If the player is arrested but not to the severity of execution, Bane is shown being locked away as the sounds of shouting prisoners is heard. *Bankruptcy: If the player exhausts all capital to the point the hoods desert, Bane is shown angrily leaving an empty office as a picture of his father falls to the floor. ==Reception== Daniel Erickson reviewed the PC version of the game for Next Generation, rating it two stars out of five, and stated that \\"Another bad stab at a goodfella's idea.\\" The game achieved mediocre success with critics, with it given a 5.4/10 rating by GameSpot,http://uk.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/gangsters2vendetta/review.html Gamespot's Gangsters 2 page 53/100 by GameSpyhttp://archive.gamespy.com/reviews/july01/gangsters2/ Gamespy's Gangsters 2 review page while PC Zone magazine gave it a 5.5/10.http://www.computerandvideogames.com/game.php?id=2666 PC Zone Magazine's Gangsters 2 page ==References== ==External links== *Eidos page *Trygames page Category:2001 video games Category:Eidos Interactive games Category:Organized crime video games Category:Video game sequels Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Windows games Category:Windows-only games ","title":"Gangsters 2"},{"id":"9108903","text":"The Sounds of '66 is a 1966 live album by Sammy Davis, Jr., accompanied by the Buddy Rich Big Band.

Some Swiss challenges also allow the entity which submitted the unsolicited bid itself then to match or better the best bid which comes out of the Swiss challenge process. Indian journalist Vinayak Chatterjee describes it as \\"one of the lesser known and even lesser-used methods of public procurement for core and social infrastructure projects\\".Swiss Challenge, Indian Style in Business Standard 7 December 2015, accessed 3 April 2016 == Swiss Challenge System == A Swiss Challenge System is a bidding process designed to elicit private sector initiative in core sector projects. It's an offer made by the original proponent to the government ensuring his process to be best (in terms of effectiveness including both the factors cost and time) by his initiative as a result of his own innovative approach or on the demand of the government to perform certain task. The Swiss challenge system, like the bonus system, further allows third parties to make better offers (challenges) for a project during a designated period with simple objective to discourage frivolous project, or to avoid exaggerated project development costs. Then accordingly, the original proponent gets the right to counter-match any superior offers given by the third party. == System == There are two different patterns which the commissioning entity may adopt: # The government may purchase the intellectual property rights for a project concept from the proponent or then award the project through a competitive bidding process in which no bidder has a predefined advantage. # The government can offer the original proponent an advantage in a competitive bidding process. In this case the government should create rewards that satisfy the original proponent while still allowing a truly competitive process. However, it has been observed that in both bonus and Swiss challenge systems it is not easy to find the right balance between incentives to propose beneficial projects and incentives for third parties to submit counter proposals. In Korea and the Philippines, however, very few projects have been successfully challenged. In Chile the probability of a successful challenge appears to be high, though experience is limited. In an effort to find the right balance, some countries (such as Argentina) have begun to explore hybrid systems combining elements of the bonus system and the Swiss challenge system. However, in some countries the proposer does have certain advantages. Unlike, the lowest bidder will not be given the work order for the project. Instead, the participant who floats the design and concept for the project will have the first right of refusal. There are various attributes, which the government takes into account while dealing with the Swiss challenge system it includes: 1\\\\. Offering cost reimbursement Some countries such as Chile and South Africa allow reimbursement of original project proponents for their project concept or project development costs. The advantage given to the original proponent in the bidding is usually intended to compensate for use of the project concept. In addition, the bidding documents sometimes specify reimbursement for project development costs by the winning bidder or the government. Other countries (such as Korea and the Philippines) allow no reimbursement of project development costs. Advantage of offering cost reimbursement maintains private sector interest during the development phase of an infrastructure project, helps to ensure that the source of ideas is not limited to large investors with deep pockets, and encourages proponents to allocate the resources needed to ensure that projects are professionally developed. 2\\\\. Setting time limits Government often sets time limits on the approval and bidding phases. Time constraints on counter proposals give an obvious competitive advantage to the original project proponent. The proponent has already spent much time and effort preparing the project and thus is much more familiar with its characteristics. By contrast, a challenger may have as little as 60 days in some countries (such as the Philippines) to prepare a counterproposal. Many potential challengers may be unwilling to compete without sufficient time to prepare. ==Adoption== The Swiss Challenge system is utilised in Bangladesh to procure infrastructure development through public-private partnerships. The technique was used for the development of Mega Film City Venture by the Jaipur Development Authority (JDA). The JDA - a Rajasthani public authority - is planning to fund the venture using the Swiss Challenge philosophy. In 2017 Indian Railways also adopted Swiss challenge for inviting tenders for renovation of its 23 railway station. == Problems == The questions relating to legal validity of using the Swiss challenge system when a counterproposal contains different specifications than the original proposal was always being raised. The problem was being observed at the time of construction of International Passenger Terminal 3 in Manila's Manila International Airport, where several issues relating to validity of system were being raised. The challenger was eventually awarded the concession. Concerns are also raised that unsolicited proposals (or the Swiss Challenge) may be actively discouraged as they bring information asymmetries in the procurement process and result in lack of transparency and in the fair and equal treatment of potential bidders. ==References== ==External links== *Unsolicited Proposals - Competitive Solutions for Private Infrastructure from World Bank *General Guidelines for Unsolicited Proposals in the Philippines Category:Government procurement ","title":"Swiss challenge (procurement)"},{"id":"9108937","text":"Midrash Samuel (Hebrew: ◊û◊ì◊®◊© ◊©◊û◊ï◊ê◊ú) is an aggadic midrash on the books of Samuel. ==Names== It is first quoted by Rashi, who calls it by several names: \\"Midrash Shmuel\\",Rashi, commentary on I Samuel 2:30 \\"Aggadat Midrash Shmuel\\",Rashi, commentary to Genesis 36:3 \\"Aggadah deShmuel\\",Rashi, commentary to I Chronicles 10:3 and \\"Midrash 'Et la-'Asot la-Adonai\\"Ha-Pardes (ed. Constantinople, p. 24b), quoting Midrash Shmuel 17:1 (ed. S. Buber, p. 48a) \\\\- the last name probably derived from Psalms 119:126, with which the midrash begins. It is also called \\"Aggadat Shmu'el\\".Rashi, in his commentary on Sukkah 53b, s.v. \\"Ahaspa\\"; Tosafot So·π≠ah 42b, s.v. \\"Me'ah\\"; et al. The name \\"Shocher Tov\\" has been erroneously given to it,In the editions of Zolkiev, 1800, and Lemberg, 1808 and 1850 the error is because in the Venice edition of 1546 the midrash was printed together with Midrash Tehillim, whose title \\"Shocher Tov\\" was taken to refer to both works. == Contents of the midrash == The midrash is divided into 32 chapters. Chapters 1-24 cover I Samuel, and chapters 25-32 cover II Samuel. The midrash contains aggadic interpretations and homilies on the books of Samuel, each homily being prefaced and introduced by a verse taken from some other book of the Bible. It resembles most of the other aggadic midrashim in diction and in style; in fact, it is a collection of teachings found in such midrashim and referring to the books of Samuel. The editor arranged the teachings in the sequence of the Scripture passages to which they refer. The midrash, however, does not entirely cover the Biblical books; but as it contains all the passages quoted from it by other authorities, it may be assumed that (with two exceptions added by later copyists: chapter 4:1ed. S. Buber, p. 27b; compare note 7 and chapter 32:3 et seq.Compare ed. Buber, notes 9, 17, 19) it never contained any more than it does now, and that its present form is that into which it was cast by its compiler. The author has collected these teachings from the Mishnah, Tosefta, Mekhilta, Sifre, Yerushalmi, Bereshit Rabbah, Leviticus Rabbah, Shir ha-Shirim Rabbah, Kohelet Rabbah, Eichah Rabbah, Ruth Rabbah, Midrash Esther, Midrash Tehillim, Pesikta de-Rav Kahana, Pesikta Rabbati, and Tanhuma. Only once10:10 [ed. Buber, p. 26a] does he quote a teaching from Talmud Bavli (Eruvin 64a), which he introduces with the words \\"Taman amrin\\" (They say there).Compare Buber, Einleitung, p. 4a, note 1 This, as well as the fact that all the amoraim mentioned in this midrash lived in the Land of Israel, justifies the assumption that its compiler lived there as well. His name and the time at which he lived can not be definitely determined. Zunz assigns him to the first half of the 11th century, although the reasons which he gives for this assumption have been refuted by S. Buber.Einleitung, p. 4b indicate that the work was composed much earlier than the 11th century (although later revised), since it is cited by Samuel ben Hofni, Nissim Gaon, and other early sources. == Editions == A manuscript of this midrash is in the Parma Library.Codex De Rossi, No. 563 The first printed edition appeared at Constantinople in 1517. In 1546 it was printed again in Venice, and subsequently at various places and times. An 1893 edition was produced by Solomon Buber, with introduction and notes (Cracow). == Bibliography == *.

Brynithel RFC is a member of the Welsh Rugby Union and is a feeder club for the Newport Gwent Dragons. ==Club history== The club was formed on 1 December 1974 at the Mount Pleasant Inn, Brynithel, after a meeting of local men who were at the time playing for teams from the Mount Pleasant Inn and T9 face at Six Bells colliery. They played six matches at the end of the 1974/75 season captained by Robert Williams. The first official game was against Bargoed 2nd XV in which Brynithel opened the scoring but ended up being beaten by 50-5. The first full season for Brynithel was 1975/76 with 3 wins and 29 losses. However the club continued to prosper and its first taste of success came as they finished as runners up in the old second division of the Gwent Districts and qualified for a playoff against Hollybush RFC. The game was played in atrocious conditions with Hollybush winning by scoring the only try of the game in the second period of extra time. Brynithel again reached this final in 1984, this time hosting the game against Cwm RFC and winning it by 19 pts to 0. Over the ensuing years Brynithel had their problems as did other clubs but were able to provide some shocks in the Cyrus Davies Cup against some very good sides, notably against RTB Ebbw Vale, shortly before they gained Welsh Rugby Union status. In 1992 Brynithel reached their first Cyrus Davies Cup final losing in the final to Holybush RFC. The following year Brynithel got their revenge, winning the cup through tries by Dean Slimmon and Lee Howells. Michael Hurn was voted Man of the Match. Brynithel failed to reach the final in 1994 losing at the semi-final stage. However, that was the last game they lost in this competition being champions for the next four years before becoming members of the WRU in 1998. Brynithel were put into Division 7, however, in the ensuing period, they have made steady progress and won promotion to Division 2 East in 2004/2005 under skipper Gareth John Davies of Treowen. During their time in the Districts, several players gained international honours for the Welsh Districts XV; Carl Mogford, Eugene Glastonbury, Mike Hurn, Mike Peck, Ashley Perry & finally Ieuan Brooks who became one of the youngest players capped at this level.

In Great Britain, it is only present in north-western Scotland and is confined to the south-western part of Ireland. It is present in all of northern Eurasia. In Western Europe, it is present in alpine areas and wherever a suitable habitat can be found. It is found in the Rila mountains of Bulgaria. ==References== Category:Corduliidae Category:Dragonflies of Europe Category:Insects described in 1840 ","title":"Northern emerald"},{"id":"9109113","text":"Jacques Doyasb√®re (Villeneuve-Saint-Georges, Val-de-Marne, December 26, 1919 Paris, 3 November 1969, aged 49) was a French thoroughbred racing jockey.L'Express (France), 1969 \\"D√©c√©d√© : Jacques Doyasb√®re, 49 ans, le 3 novembre, √† Paris, des suites d'une maladie.

His best known work is in Children's Programmes, and Christmas activities for needy children. ==Early life== The youngest of three surviving children, Frans (Francis) was born to Mary n√©e Brincat and Publio Said, a merchant. His birth took place at the administrative manager's residence of the ‚ÄúTa‚Äô Braxja‚Äù Cemetery. His maternal family had been the owners of the plot and adjacent land where the British had built a cemetery for non-Catholic Christians, mainly British servicemen stationed in Malta. His mother had been staying for a few months with her family. Brought up in Floriana, Malta, his family had suffered greatly during the Second World War and were impoverished due to enemy actions. It was during the war and still a child that Frans Said started his literary career. After the war he sat for a competitive examination to enter The Lyceum which at that time was the leading secondary school in Malta. Only a few students could be accepted. From thousands of candidates who sat for the post war examination he placed sixth. ==Broadcasting and the stage== Both in The Lyceum and also in the town association, Frans joined drama groups. At school he used to take part in the yearly Shakespeare production, while in his group, he not only took (a leading) part, but more often than not, also wrote the script of the plays and comedies. His father died on the 12 February 1948, by which time Frans had already initiated the fledgling children's programme on the local cable radio. He was thus one of the few pioneers in Maltese broadcasting. Even though at a relatively young age he was invariably the producer and planner of those programmes which from once weekly soon developed into a daily production. He soon became known as Uncle Frans (Iz-Ziju Frans). In conjunction with these programmes, he wrote many original works in Maltese, and carried out translations of a number of classical works. With his translations the children of Malta were introduced to many of the great classics. The radio management noticed his potential and he was sent to study, initially, at the BBC in London, and later on with RAI in Rome and the Happy Station Show in the Netherlands. On his return to Malta, Frans had become the brains and driving force behind the Children's Programmes and what was originally a weekly half hour was eventually extended to a daily afternoon magazine edition. With the assistance of others he pioneered children's radio drama in Maltese. During the years, the children's drama encompassed a wide spectrum from comedy, adventure, thrillers, musicals, up to pure drama. As a corollary from this he started to organise Christmas Parties, initially for the many children of the drama group and later on for the needy children of the islands. ==The Christmas Parties== From a modest 300 needy children in 1952, these parties grew to big proportions, so that after 19 years (the last party was held in 1970) more than 40,000 children had been entertained. (This represents 12% of the population at that time of the Islands). Due to his eventual connections with the British Forces, he managed to obtain assistance from the armed forces. In 1960 the aircraft carrier HMS Ark Royal (R09) was specifically brought to Malta to host 2000 children. In later years, these parties were held under the alternate auspices of the three UK services serving in Malta. ==Other Programs== For five years from 1961 onwards he organised and presented a weekly ‚ÄúRound Malta Quiz,‚Äù which enjoyed great popularity. He also organised large variety shows, tickets for which were sold within hours. In the sixties he took over the full organisation of the daily Children's Programmes. All this work was done on a part-time basis as he had his own full-time employment. For two years he was also involved in TV productions. For his work he received a number of awards. He retired from broadcasting in 1979, after nearly 32 years active service. ==Civic Activities== As secretary to the Floriana Civic Council, he had also been active in civic affairs and was the co-founder of the Confederation of Civic Councils of which he had also been elected Secretary and was the founder of ‚ÄúMidalja tal-Meritu‚Äù (The Medal of Merit) (1968) (that preceded the ƒ†ieƒß ir- Repubblika award) that for a number of years used to be awarded annually by the Confederation of Civic Councils. ==Personal life== In 1957, Frans met his future wife Enoe (n√©e Calleja) daughter of Maestro Abele Calleja. They were married on 24 January 1960. They had three children, namely Adrian, Giuseppe and Oliver. ==Career== In 1952, having passed his matriculation examinations, Frans entered the Royal Air Force in Malta as a junior civilian clerk. Considering that he was Maltese, his progress in the British RAF was rapid. The RAF sent him on a number of courses and training sessions in UK. Within five years he was posted to the RAF Headquarters where he received a number of promotions to senior positions. Eventually he attained the equivalent rank of Squadron Leader. He enjoyed full security clearance and was also awarded, honoured and mentioned in dispatches. He retired from the RAF in 1967 when he joined the fledgling local industry. With his meticulous approach to life, he had already prepared himself for the positions he hoped to attain having taken a number of specialised courses, invariably obtaining a diploma or certificate of competence. He held a number of managerial positions reaching the grade of General Manager. Due to various factors, including the political upheaval of the 70's, Frans sought work in Libya. His first position was as Special Projects Manager in Marsa El Bregha (with Exxon); and later, as consultant and advisor with the National Oil Corporation and other oil companies in Tripoli. ==Return to Malta== In 1989, Frans was invited to return to Malta and offered the position of Chief Executive Officer of Medserv Ltd. (a parastatal company that ran a specialised port and provided support services to the offshore oil industry). He was later also appointed Managing Director. In 1993, the employees of the company nominated him, and a special government committee selected him, as The Worker of Year. During that period he was offered the position of Maltese Ambassador to the UN Agencies in Geneva, Switzerland. Due to many personal commitments he declined but eventually accepted to act as Honorary Consul of Croatia in Malta. In December 1997, due to certain intrigues and political machinations he was accused of corruption and bad management. It took eight years (until 2006) for the Law Courts to reach a decision, in which Frans was completely exonerated and declared fully innocent. The Magistrate stated that all actions had been based on blatant lies and instigated due to jealousy, vindictiveness and intrigue. Eventually, the highest Law Court in Malta under its Constitutional jurisdiction declared that all the actions against Frans Said were frivolous and vexatious and awarded him appropriate damages. This judgement was further confirmed and enforced by The European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) in Strasbourg which also awarded further damages. During his tenure of office, Frans represented Malta in many international fora mainly connected with ‚Äúoil‚Äù. He was a fellow and also served on the Council of the UK Institute of Petroleum and on the Permanent Council of the World Petroleum Congresses. He also organised a number of major conferences and exhibitions including MOEX and Clean Seas which also included the Clean Seas International Awards. In partnership with the University of Malta he established The Mediterranean College of Petroleum Studies (MECOPS) which was set up in association with The Petroleum College, Oxford, and P.I.T.S. of Alberta Canada. ==Literary works== On and off, Frans never stopped writing. During his sojourn in Libya he tried his hand at poetry, among other genres. After retirement, Frans wrote five full-length novels in English and was also a member of the team that translated the acquis communautaire (the EU Laws and Court Sentences) of the European Union into Maltese. Frans alone translated more than 40,000 pages (representing 33% of the full task) dealing with every topic under the sun. He is also still active in producing articles for Maltese and foreign newspapers and magazines. During his sixty-six years of writing, Frans produced more than 1000 pieces of literary works both in Maltese and English. These works have been donated to the people of Malta, and are now kept in the Maltese National Archives in Rabat, Malta. ==Latest ventures== He has collected all the known √Üsop's Fables and similar anecdotes (over 2000 fables), which he translated into Maltese. These started being published on a daily basis on the Maltese Newspaper L-Orizzont from 1 January 2006. He also personally read many of these fables on Radio Malta as part of the programme \\"Newsline\\". In 2018 he started researching and collecting the international famous Panchantantra Indian Fables. It is expected that these will also be published in L-Orizzont on the same basis as happened with Aesop's Fables. Even at the advanced age of 87 he is currently translating into Maltese the complete work by Jeoffrey Chaucer, a 455 page marathon, namely The Canterbury Tales. The work is still in progress. ==National honour== At the age of 82 years and a career extending to 67 years, Frans received the Maltese National Honour for services rendered to the Republic. The investiture was made by the President of Malta on Republic Day, 13 December 2014. Eventually his portrait was included in the National Portrait Gallery housed in Imdina, Malta's historic old capital. The inauguration was part of further presentation of his works, including the collection of Aesop and other fables to the National Archives. ==References== * The Sunday Times (of Malta) 7 September 2003; * The Sunday Times (of Malta) 27 February 2005; * The Sunday Times (of Malta) 17th & 24 December 2006; * The Sunday Times (of Malta) 25 February 2007; * The Sunday Times (of Malta) 16 September 2007; * The Sunday Times (of Malta) 21 September 2008; * The Times (of Malta) 11 May 2007; * The Times (of Malta) 7 May 2009; * L-Orizzont (Malta) 30 December 2006 et seq.; * It-Torca (Malta) 21 September 2008; * Il- Mument (Malta) 21 September 2008; * http://www.education.gov.mt/employment/ind_relations/haddiem_sena.htm; * www.timesofmalta.com (archives Frans H Said); * Medal of merit; * The National Library (Bibliotheca), Valletta, Malta; * The National Archives, Rabat, Malta; * The Malta Government Gazette No. 19,357 (13 December 2014) * L-Orizzont (Malta) 28 February 2015 Category:1932 births Category:Living people Category:Maltese male writers Category:Translators to Maltese ","title":"Frans Said"},{"id":"9109135","text":"Pitshill is a Grade II* listed house built in the neoclassical style and is located within the Parish of Tillington a couple of miles west of Petworth.

It is built in limestone ashlar with rusticated ground floor and a balustraded parapet over the side portions. The remaining elevations are brick and render decorated to match the east front and were constructed in the 1790s to plans influenced but not completed by Sir John Soane. Further substantial works were carried out to the house in the 1830s as well as the later Nineteenth Century additions of a veranda and conservatory, these being removed in the 1950s leaving a classical style rectangular building. The main house is augmented by two nineteenth century lodges, an 1840s stable block, a shell house, probably late eighteenth century, all Grade II listed and standing within a Grade II listed park. in addition there is an ice house, also probably 18th century, and a late nineteenth century tower.

Altering Ki-67 expression levels did not significantly affect cell proliferation in vivo. Ki-67 mutant mice developed normally and cells lacking Ki-67 proliferated efficiently. Furthermore, it is associated with ribosomal RNA transcription. Inactivation of antigen KI-67 leads to inhibition of ribosomal RNA synthesis. == Use as a marker of proliferating cells== Ki-67 immunostaining of a brain tumour with a high proliferative rate. The Ki-67 protein (also known as MKI67) is a cellular marker for proliferation, and can be used in immunohistochemistry. It is strictly associated with cell proliferation. During interphase, the Ki-67 antigen can be exclusively detected within the cell nucleus, whereas in mitosis most of the protein is relocated to the surface of the chromosomes. Ki-67 protein is present during all active phases of the cell cycle (G1, S, G2, and mitosis), but is absent in resting (quiescent) cells (G0). Cellular content of Ki-67 protein markedly increases during cell progression through S phase of the cell cycle. In breast cancer Ki67 identifies a high proliferative subset of patients with ER-positive breast cancer who derive greater benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy == Antibody labeling == Ki-67 is an excellent marker to determine the growth fraction of a given cell population. The fraction of Ki-67-positive tumor cells (the Ki-67 labeling index) is often correlated with the clinical course of cancer. The best-studied examples in this context are prostate, brain and breast carcinomas, as well as nephroblastoma and neuroendocrine tumors. For these types of tumors, the prognostic value for survival and tumor recurrence have repeatedly been proven in uni- and multivariate analysis. === MIB-1 === Ki-67 and MIB-1 monoclonal antibodies are directed against different epitopes of the same proliferation- related antigen. Ki-67 and MIB-1 may be used on fixed sections. MIB-1 is used in clinical applications to determine the Ki-67 labelling index. One of its primary advantages over the original Ki-67 antibody (and the reason why it has essentially supplanted the original antibody for clinical use) is that it can be used on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections, after heat-mediated antigen retrieval (see next section below). File:Positive immunohistochemistry of KI-67 in invasive breast cancer.jpgHigh Ki-67 expression in an invasive breast cancer, with cancer nuclei being stained (brown).

To count as positive, a nucleus should be homogenously darkly stained (not just stippled), at least half within the field of view, be large enough, and not be located in the stroma. === Original Ki-67 antibody === The Ki-67 protein was originally defined by the prototype monoclonal antibody Ki-67, which was generated by immunizing mice with nuclei of the Hodgkin lymphoma cell line L428. The name is derived from the city of origin (Kiel, Germany) and the number of the original clone in the 96-well plate. == Interactions == Ki-67 (protein) has been shown to interact with CBX3. ==See also== *PCNA - Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen, expressed during the DNA synthesis. ==Additional images== Image:Mouse NT antibody NF Ki67.jpgImmunofluorescent antibody staining against neurofilament (green) and Ki-67 (red) in a mouse embryo 12.5 days after fertilization.

Balkhash (; ) is a city in Kazakhstan, located on the northern shore of the Lake Balkhash, on the Bay Bertys, and in south of Kazakh Uplands. Population of the city: Balkhash was founded in 1937 as an industrial city centred on the mining and smelting of copper, and presently copper is still exploited there. The city lies approximately 500 km west of the Chinese border on the north side of the lake at an altitude of 440 m. The history of the city is closely connected with mining of deposits of copper and development of a smelting plant. ==History== On 11 April 1937, a small worker's settlement \\"Pribalhashstroy\\", designed in connection with the construction of a copper factory - BGMC, was transformed into the city of Balkhash by decision of the Central Executive Committee of the Kazakh SSR. In this way, the copper factory effected the city's appearance. On 9 November 1932, the first school was established in the city - school No. 1. The school educated a few children of the builders of the city that time. Among these children was Maria Nicolaevna Guseva (Halova). This school became a matter of her life: firstly she was one of the first pupils. Later, she became a teacher. In 1935, a section for parachuting was opened. Its first director was Dyusembayev. During the Great Patriotic War (Russian term for World War II), most of the male population was conscripted into the military service and women replaced them in the copper factory. After World War II, Japanese war prisoners took part in the building of the city. In particular, they built buildings, the \\"Palace of Metallurgists\\" and the local airport. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, between 1992 and 1996, the city and its residents, like most former Soviet citizens, experienced an acute crisis, including power outages, weak central heating and intermittent operation of the copper factory. Some people cooked on fires in their yards; in winter they heated their apartments with potbelly stoves. Summer cottages served as an additional source of foodstuffs, contributing to the populace's survival. In the late 1990s, the city's and country's economies stabilised. A new neighborhood was built in the city, the so-called \\"Canadian cottages\\". All schools, medical facilities and the college started to function normally. ==Administration and directorates== Due to the appointment of former Mayor Kadyrzhan Teylyanova as Chairman of the Committee of Fisheries of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Republic of Kazakhstan, Nurlan Erikbaevich Aubakirov (born 29.12.1975) has been the mayor of Balkash since 29 May 2012. Balkhash's city government also administers the urban-type settlements of Sayak (3669 people), Gulshat and Chubar-Tubek (625 people). In May 1997, the city of Balkhash was transferred from Dzhezkazgan Region to Karaganda Region due to a boundary change. ==Population== The combined population of the city and its urban area is 75,453 people (2010).

From its plan and scope, it is apparently an incomplete collection of the rich aggadic material which has been produced on the Book of Esther. == Structure == Except in the Vilna and Warsaw editions with their modern and arbitrary divisions, this Midrash consists of six \\"parashiyyot\\" (chapters, sections; singular = \\"parashah\\") introduced by one or more proems. These chapters begin respectively at Esther 1:1, 1:4, 1:9, 1:13, 2:1, 2:5. In the Venice edition of 1545, each chapter has at the end the words \\"selika parashata...\\" This division was probably based on the sections of the Esther scroll, as indicated by the closed paragraphs (◊°◊™◊ï◊û◊ï◊™); such paragraphs existing in the present text to 1:9, 1:13, 1:16, 2:1, 2:5, etc. The beginning of 1:4, as well as the lack of a beginning to 1:16, may be due to differences in the division of the text. It may furthermore be assumed that a new parashah began with the section Esther 3:1, where several poems precede the comment of the midrash. From Esther 3:1 onward, there is hardly a trace of further division into chapters. There is no new parashah even to Esther 4:1, the climax of the Biblical drama. As the division into parashiyot has not been carried out throughout the work, so too the running commentary to the Biblical text is much reduced in chapters 7‚Äì8, and is discontinued entirely at the end of chapters 8. The various paragraphs that follow chapter 8 seem to have been merely tacked on. ==Sources and dating== The Book of Esther early became the subject of discussion in the schoolhouses, as may be seen from Megillah 10b et seq., where long aggadic passages are joined to single verses. Esther Rabbah is variously connected with these passages. The author of Esther Rabbah often draws directly upon the Yerushalmi, Bereshit Rabbah, Wayikra Rabbah, Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer, Targumim, and other ancient sources. Bereshit Rabbah or Vayikra Rabbah may also have furnished the long passage in parashah 1, in connection with the explanation of the first word (◊ï◊ô◊î◊ô). Parashah 6 shows several traces of a later period: especially remarkable hereed. Venice, 45c, d; ed. Wilna, 14a, b is the literal borrowing from Yosippon, where Mordechai's dream, Mordechai's and Esther's prayers, and the appearance of Mordechai and Esther before the king are recounted.Compare also the additions in the LXX. to Esther 1:1 and 4:17 However, these borrowings do not justify assigning to the midrash (as S. Buber does) a date later than Yosippon, such as the mid-10th century; for as early as Azariah dei RossiMe'or 'Enayim (ed. Wilna, p. 231) they have been noted as later interpolations. According to , the midrash may be considered to be composed of two different parts which were combined in the 12th or 13th century. # An older part characterized by non-anonymous proems, originating in Palestine around 500 CE, which draws material from Talmud Yerushalmi, Genesis Rabbah, and Leviticus Rabbah. This part is then itself cited in such works as Ecclesiastes Rabbah and Midrash Psalms. # A younger part drawing from Yosippon, which may be dated to the 11th century. In any case, this midrash may be considered older and more original than the Midrash Abba Gorion to the Book of Esther. The Yalkut Shimoni quotes many passages from the latter midrash, as well as from another aggadic commentary.Edited by Buber in the collection Sammlung Agadischer Commentare zum Buche Esther, Wilna, 1886 The midrash here considered is entitled \\"Midrash Megillat Esther\\" in the Venice edition. Nahmanides quotes it as the Haggadah to the Esther roll. It may be assumed with certainty that it is of Judean origin. ==References== * . The JE cites the following works: ** Zunz, G.

Borman is an American quantitative methodologist and policy analyst. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Chicago in 1997 and is currently the Vilas Distinguished Achievement Professor at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, Director of the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison‚Äôs federally funded Predoctoral Interdisciplinary Research Training Program, and a Senior Researcher with the Consortium for Policy Research in Education at the Wisconsin Center for Education Research. ==Activities and interests== Borman's main research interests revolve around social stratification and the ways in which educational policies and practices can help address and overcome inequality. His primary methodological interests include the synthesis of research evidence (or meta-analysis), the design of quasi-experimental and experimental studies of educational innovations, and the specification of school-effects models. Borman's scholarship has contributed to understanding how federal education programs have reduced the persistent achievement gaps in American society. His 2001 book, Title I: Compensatory Education at the Crossroads (Borman, Stringfield, & Slavin, 2001), discussed the history, student achievement effects, and future of the federal government's largest investment in elementary and secondary education: Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (most recently reauthorized as the No Child Left Behind Act of 2002). His article \\"National Efforts to Bring Reform to Scale in High-Poverty Schools: Outcomes and Implications\\",http://www.education.wisc.edu/elpa/people/faculty/Borman/Borman2005Reform_to_Scale.pdf traced the history and academic effects of America's investments in elementary and secondary education over the period 1965-2001 (Borman, 2005). His work has demonstrated how randomized controlled trials (RCTs) can be applied to studying the large-scale effects of educational policies and programs implemented on a widespread basis in field settings. Over the past ten years, Borman has led or co-directed twelve major randomized controlled trials, which have included randomization and delivery of educational interventions at the student, classroom, school, and district levels. One notable example is his recent RCT, \\"Final Reading Outcomes of the National Randomized Field Trial of Success for All\\" (Borman, Slavin, Cheung, Chamberlain, Madden, & Chambers, 2007), which estimated the effects of a popular nationally disseminated reading program for young children from high-poverty schools.http://www.education.wisc.edu/elpa/people/faculty/Borman/Borman_et_al_FinReadOutcomes2007.pdf When asked by Education Week reporter Deb Viadero about the study, the director of the Institute of Education Sciences of the U.S. Department of Education, Grover Whitehurst, was quoted as saying: \\"It's a sophisticated study that uses everything the evaluation field has come to recognize as high quality\\" (May 11, 2005, p. 2, 15). Borman has been appointed as a methodological expert to advise many national research and development projects, including the National Research Center on the Gifted and Talented and three of the nation‚Äôs regional educational laboratories funded by the Institute of Education Sciences. He serves on the editorial boards of six academic journals, including the American Educational Research Journal, Research Synthesis Methods, and Elementary School Journal. He is a Principal Standing Panel Member of the Education Systems and Broad Reform Research Review Panel of the U.S. Department of Education, Institute of Education Sciences and was named to the 15-member Urban Education Research Task Force established to advise the U.S. Department of Education on issues affecting urban education. His research has been funded by a variety of organizations, including the National Science Foundation, U.S. Department of Education, Office of Educational Research and Improvement, Institute of Education Sciences, American Educational Research Association Grants Program, Spencer Foundation, Open Society Institute, and Smith-Richardson Foundation, among others. ==Awards and honors== He was the recipient of a 2002 National Academy of Education/Spencer Postdoctoral Fellowship Award, the 2004 Raymond Cattell Early Career Award from the American Educational Research Association, the 2004 American Educational Research Association Review of Research Award,http://www.aera.net/AboutAERA/Default.aspx?menu_id=20&id;=237 and the 2008 American Educational Research Association Palmer O. Johnson Award. When he received the American Educational Research Association Early Career Award in San Diego on April 14, 2004 at the Awards Presentation and Presidential Address of the American Educational Research Association Annual Meeting, Stephen Raudenbush, the Lewis-Sebring Professor in Sociology at the University of Chicago and the Chair of the Award Committee, stated that his \\"books and numerous articles have established Geoffrey Borman as one of the nation's premier researchers on federal education policy for children living in poverty.\\" In 2009, Dr. Borman‚Äôs significant contributions to the field of education research were recognized by his nomination and selection as a Fellow of the American Educational Research Association. ==Select bibliography== Borman, G.D., & Dowling, N.M.

Though not listed in any extant Irish genealogies, the Annals of Innisfallen record his death at the battle of Mag Femen in the kingdom of Brega in 446. Almost uniquely, this otherwise unverifiable reference is corroborated by an Ogham inscription on a stone near Slane in the neighbouring County Louth. It reads MAQI CAIRATINI AVI INEQAGLAS, which translates as [the stone] of Mac Cairthinn grandson [or perhaps descendant] of Enechglass. This would make him a contemporary of Niall Noig√≠allach. The Irish annals, recording the battle of Mag Femen, say of Mac Cairthinn, \\"[s]ome say he was of the Cruithni\\". This appears to be based on the false assumption that his father was the eponymous ancestor of the D√°l nAraidi sept of U√≠ Ch√≥elbad. Other unreliable and late sources may have linked Mac Cairthinn with the U√≠ N√©ill, by making his father C√≥elbad a son of Niall. ==Early historic Leinster== According to D√°ibh√≠ √ì Cr√≥in√≠n the above demonstrates \\"how far north Leinster's territorial claims once extended\\" and that warfare between the Laigin and the emerging U√≠ N√©ill occurred in the north of Brega and on the plains of what is now County Meath and County Westmeath. All these territories would be lost to the U√≠ N√©ill in the following century. ==Date of Cath Mag Femen== The date of the battle of Mag Femen is given as 446 in the Annals of Ulster and 447 in the Annals of Inisfallen. However, Devane (p. 189, 2005) proposes that the date has been misplaced, as a result of \\"the original source of the entries being wrongly entered by one, if not indeed two, cycles in the Irish 84-year cycle, by the which the Irish and British churches until the sixth century reckoned the date of Easter. A discrepancy of one calendar cycle would push the date of the battle of Femen forward to the year 530, which ... would lend weight to the argument that it was the son or sons of Coirpre, and not Coirpre himself who defeated the Ui Enechglaiss at the battle of Femen.\\" ==References== * Byrne, Francis John, Irish Kings and High-Kings Batsford, London, 1973. * Charles-Edwards, T.M., Early Christian Ireland, pp. 453-458\\\\. * Ireland, 400-800, pp. 188, by D√°ibh√≠ √ì Cr√≥in√≠n A New History of Ireland, Vol.I, (edited √ì Cr√≥in√≠n). * Carbury, Co.

They ran for over 70 years, many of which as the town's leading club and were one of the early pioneers of football in the area. ==History== Eastleigh Athletic FC were formed by workers at the Eastleigh Railway Depot sometime in the early 1890s and were originally known as Eastleigh LSWR (London & South Western Railway). The club owned their own sports ground at Dutton Lane in the town, which over the years was developed with an oval cycling track and grandstand for spectators. In 1896 they adopted their best known identity of Eastleigh Athletic and were one of the eight founder members of the Hampshire League. On 5 September 1896 they took part in an historic match against Freemantle - the first ever game of the new competition. On a glorious sunny afternoon, the two teams provided plenty of entertainment for the large crowd with the match receiving full coverage from the Hants & Dorset press. Eastleigh narrowly lost that day 4-5 and fielded the following team: Collins, Dexter, Brocklehurst, Silverman, Bull, Service, Jeffcote, Bastock, Woodhouse, Knox and Sharp. Eastleigh finished the season in 4th place. During the course of the AGM on 26 July 1897, it was mentioned by the Assistant Hon. Secretary, William Powley, that the colours of the club would be changed to chocolate and blue. This decision was to prove inspirational as in 1897‚Äì98, they were league champions and Hampshire Senior Cup winners, after a 2-1 victory against the 2nd Gordon Highlanders (Aldershot). The final was played at the County Ground, Southampton in front of a large crowd. In order to generate a full fixture list, in those days it was not uncommon for clubs to enter more than one league during the same season and in 1897‚Äì98 Eastleigh also entered a side in the Western League (Professional Section). Also playing in this eight-team Division were Swindon Town, Reading, Bristol City and Bristol Rovers - Eastleigh finished in 7th place. The following season they then joined the Southern League Division 2 (South West Section), finishing 5th out of six clubs, but on the scrapping of this short-lived division the main focus switched back to the more realistic Hampshire League. In 1903 the league was divided into regional sections with Eastleigh placed in the South Division where they consolidated, however, they still maintained a strong cup pedigree. Eastleigh Athletic were regular entrants in the national competitions and in 1902‚Äì03 enjoyed their best run in the FA Cup when they reached the 4th Qualifying Round, losing 1‚Äì3 away to Whiteheads, the Dorset League champions. 1908‚Äì09 was another milestone season, when the Southampton FA was formed with Eastleigh becoming founder members, and entering Reserve sides in the Associations' newly formed league. There was further cup glory when they recorded a fine double by again winning the Hampshire Senior Cup after a 2‚Äì0 victory against the 2nd Cameron Highlanders (Tidworth) and also the inaugural Southampton Senior Cup after a 2‚Äì0 victory over Winchester City (both games were played at The Dell, Southampton). The 1910‚Äì11 season saw the 'Railwaymen' reach another two finals; the Hampshire Senior Cup was won for the third and final time after a 4‚Äì2 success against Kings Royal Rifles Corps (Gosport) at Fratton Park, Portsmouth :www:Hampshire Senior Cup but they were denied a cup double after losing 1‚Äì3 against Bitterne Guild, in the Southampton Senior Cup. The early twenties saw Eastleigh yo-yo between the county league's two divisions, winning the West Division title in 1922‚Äì23. In 1925, after a poor season, they opted to join the less demanding Southampton League, where they soon found their feet again as they consecutively won the Junior 3, Junior 2 and South Hants Division titles during the final three seasons of the decade. In 1930 the club returned to the Hampshire League Division 2 under the name of SR Eastleigh Athletic (S.R. stood for Southern Railway, the owner of the locomotive works in Eastleigh) and the team soon re-established themselves as they pushed for promotion. After several near misses they were champions in 1938‚Äì39 only to have their progress halted by the outbreak of World War II. In 1947 Eastleigh again returned to the county League when they were placed in Division 3 East. Until this point they had been the town's senior club, but the post war era saw the emergence of local rivals Pirelli General, Eastleigh Spartans and Swaythling Athletic in the Hampshire League and this saw increased competition for the area's best players. British Rail took over the works in 1949 and this saw the club's name amended to BR Eastleigh Athletic, and after several steady seasons their fortunes gradually improved. In 1956‚Äì57 they won promotion as Division 3 runners-up and remained a steady Division 2 side for a number of years until 1961 when they had to leave the competition. A year later they returned, and were placed in Division 3, but after several seasons of struggle they finished bottom in 1964‚Äì65 and were consequently relegated back to the Southampton League. Worse was to follow when Eastleigh Athletic then unexpectedly lost the use of their ground during the 1966‚Äì67 campaign, when the Railway Goods Yard was expanded ‚Äì this prompted the club to withdraw from the league and inevitably fold. ==Honours== *Hampshire League **Champions 1897/98 *Hampshire League Division 2 **Champions 1938/39 **Runners-up 1931/32 *Hampshire League Division 3 **Runners-up 1956/57 *Hampshire League West Division **Champions 1922/23 *Hampshire League South Division **Runners-up 1919/20 *Southampton League Junior Division 2 **Champions 1927/28 *Southampton League Junior Division 3 **Champions 1926/27 *Southampton League South Hants Division **Champions 1928/29 *Hampshire FA Senior Cup **Winners 1897/98, 1908/09 and 1910/11 *Southampton FA Senior Cup **Winners 1908/09 **Finalists 1910/11 *Hampshire FA Junior 'A' Cup **Winners 1932/33 (Reserves) *Southampton FA Junior 'A' Cup **Winners 1929/30 (Reserves) *Southampton FA Junior Consolation Cup **Winners 1929/30 (Reserves) ==Playing Records League === { class=\\" collapsible collapsed\\" style=text-align:center !Season !Division !Position !Significant events -

Hurricane on the Bayou is both a documentary of Hurricane Katrina's effects and a call to restore Louisiana's wetlands, rebuild New Orleans, and honor the culture of the city. The film is narrated by actress Meryl Streep and driven by a jazz-, blues-, Cajun-, and gospel-fueled soundtrack featuring Tab Benoit, Amanda Shaw, Mavis Staples, and Allen Toussaint. It was originally a \\"what-if\\" scenario about a major hurricane impacting New Orleans - prior to Hurricane Katrina. The film debuted at the Entergy IMAX in New Orleans, on the one-year anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, several months before being shown elsewhere. ==Plot== The film begins in the bayou itself, as a family of alligators frolic in the water to the tune of the Cajun classic \\"Iko Iko\\". The story then sets off on an historical exploration of how New Orleans rose up hundreds of years ago out of an untamed swampland ‚Äì and went on to become celebrated around the world as \\"The Big Easy\\", a place where a feeling of joyful freedom permeated the music, the food and the city's inimitable talent for turning \\"good times\\" into an art form. Here, a spicy gumbo of African, Native American, Cajun, Creole and Southern influences forged a completely unique culture. Louisiana's coastal location (the state contains 40% of all the coastal wetlands in the continental U.S. according to the National Wetlands Research Center) was both a boon and a bane to the city. New Orleans evolved into the busiest port in the U.S., but after engineers diverted the Mississippi River, depleting the wetlands, the city became increasingly vulnerable to the killer winds and rising waters of seasonal hurricanes. Today, the situation grows more and more dangerous as every year Louisiana loses enough land to make up the island of Manhattan. Setting out for the mystery-tinged bayous with Tab Benoit and Amanda Shaw, Hurricane on the Bayou reveals how in the last 50 years, the natural coastal buffer that once sheltered New Orleans from severe storms has drastically deteriorated, endangering many unique animal and plant species and leaving the city wide open to Mother Nature's ferocious forces. Spectacular flights over the Gulf of Mexico reveal the shocking reality that every half an hour, Louisiana loses a section of wetlands the size of a football field. Meanwhile, a side-trip into the vibrant swamplands probes how the bayou provides a fragile home to a family of alligators with newborn babies. Here, Tab Benoit explains that hope for New Orleans' future will lie in concerted efforts to not only preserve but restore these wetlands by redirecting the Mississippi River's silt and re-planting vital foliage. Ultimately, the story builds to the monster storm that was Katrina and the crisis it brought to New Orleans, causing families to be separated, homes to be lost and one hundred square miles of wetlands and marshes to be destroyed by saltwater (including damaged caused by Hurricane Rita). Visceral, state-of-the-art CGI effects created by Hollywood specialists Sassoon Film Design recreates the fury of the storm, when fierce winds tore off the roof of the Superdome. Then, haunting, never-before-seen 70mm footage of the storm's aftermath provides a shocking reminder of just how vast the storm's devastation really was. Finally, returning to New Orleans in the bittersweet 2006 Mardi Gras season, the film reveals a city in the first throes of recovery ‚Äì and reunites Allen Toussaint, Amanda Shaw, Chubby Carrier and Marva Wright for a passionate performance of a resonant modern hymn (written by the film's composer Steve Wood) in the oldest Cathedral in North America, New Orleans' elegant St. Louis Cathedral. ==Soundtrack== The music, produced by the Audubon Nature Institute, includes performances of the jazz, blues and gospel that appeared in the film, as well as samples of Dixieland and other pieces by Fats Domino, Chubby Carrier, and the Neville Brothers. Proceeds go to the Audubon Nature Institute. Though the film does not have a designated soundtrack, the film uses music samples from each of the musicians in the film. Iconic south Louisiana songs, such as \\"Iko Iko,\\" are also used in the documentary to place more emphasis on how cultured south Louisiana is. A Cajun theme generally influences each song. Hurricane on the Bayou introduces four New Orleans musicians: singer, songwriter, pianist, producer, and Rock 'n Roll Hall of Fame inductee Allen Toussaint; Cajun Blues guitarist and wetlands activist Tab Benoit; teenaged fiddling virtuoso and rising musician Amanda Shaw; and the man who discovered Amanda and helped produce her first album, Zydeco accordionist Chubby Carrier. Each has a story to tell about their love for Louisiana and their loss during Katrina. ==Awards== In 2007, Hurricane on the Bayou was nominated for a Golden Reel Award in Sound Editing. ==See also== * Audubon Nature Institute (based in New Orleans in the US) * Bayou ==References*Hurricane on the Bayou - A MacGillivray Freeman Film * * Category:2006 films Category:2006 documentary films Category:American documentary films Category:American films Category:Documentary films about Hurricane Katrina Category:IMAX short films Category:Short films directed by Greg MacGillivray Category:MacGillivray Freeman Films films Category:IMAX documentary films ","title":"Hurricane on the Bayou"},{"id":"9109347","text":"Ralph Young (July 1, 1918 ‚Äì August 22, 2008)Palm Springs Cemetery District \\"Interments of Interest was an American singer and actor.

Young retired at age 65 to spend more time with his family. Sandler, who was 16 years younger, continued to perform, and the two occasionally reunited for concerts, the last one when Young was in his mid-80s in Palm Springs in an All Stars Concert ‚ÄòLet Freedom Ring‚Äô in honour of the victims of 9/11.

This constituency existed from 1908 to 1967. It was the riding of Premier James T.M. Anderson. The riding was created for the 1908 election to separate the rapidly growing city of Saskatoon from the original riding of Saskatoon, which was renamed Saskatoon County. During the 15th Saskatchewan Legislative Assembly (from 1964 to 1967), an amendment to the Representation Act divided Saskatoon City into several electoral divisions: * Saskatoon City Park-University * Saskatoon Mayfair * Saskatoon Nutana Centre * Saskatoon Nutana South * Saskatoon Riversdale From 1921 to 1967 Saskatoon City was one of three districts in the province that elected more than one representative to the Legislature.

Cohen. The film premiered in April 1985 in the United States.New York Times It was executive produced by Roger Corman. == Plot == A peaceful barbarian village prepares to celebrate the wedding of Queen Amethea (Lana Clarkson) to Prince Argan (Frank Zagarino). During preparations for the wedding ceremony, the forces of Lord Arrakur (Arman Chapman) attack the village, taking Argan and Amethea's younger sister Taramis (Dawn Dunlap), whom they gang-rape, along with several others prisoner and slaughtering the remaining villagers. Amethea, her handmaiden Estrild (Katt Shea) and the female warrior Tiniara (Susana Traverso) survive the attack and set out for Arrakur's city to rescue the others and seek revenge for the destruction of their village. Along the way the three women come across a small encampment of Arrakur's forces. Amethea and Tiniara ambush and kill the men, discovering Taramis captive inside the camp, who has seemingly been traumatized by her experience and acts withdrawn. On the outskirts of Arrakur's realm the women meet members of an underground resistance force who agree to help smuggle Amethea's party into the city, but refuse to take up arms with them against the tyrannical Arrakur. Inside the city gates, Amethea discovers Argan and the other men taken from her village are being forced to fight as gladiators in the arena at the center of town. Meanwhile, Taramis notices Arrakur leading a procession of troops into his palace and approaches him. Arrakur recognizes Taramis from the camp and allows her to accompany him inside, while in another part of town Estrild is attacked and raped by two of Arrakur's guards. Amethea and Tiniara come to her defense, but the women are overpowered and taken prisoner. Estrild is made into one of the harem girls who serve the desires of the gladiators, where she is reunited with Argan, telling him of their failed rescue attempt. Amethea and Tiniara are interrogated separately; Tiniara dies in an escape attempt, while Amethea is sent to the dungeon to be tortured. Arrakur and his new concubine Taramis visit Amethea in the dungeon, where she has been stripped naked save for a leather collar and thong, to find her being stretched on the rack by the chief torturer (Tony Middleton). Taramis pretends to not know Amethea, while Arrakur demands information about the rebels who helped Amethea into the city. Amethea refuses to speak, and Arrakur demands answers by the morning, taking his leave. Meanwhile, Argan, the other gladiators, and Estrild plot an uprising against Arrakur. The torturer later rapes Amethea, but she uses her feminine strength to squeeze his manhood painfully during the assault, forcing him to release her from the rack, whereupon Amethea hurls him into a pool of acid and escapes the dungeon. Finding Estrild, the two women flee the castle and regroup with the rebels, who agree to help in the planned overthrow of Arrakur's forces led by Argan during the gladiatorial games. Amethea and the rebels join with the gladiators in the attack. Amethea fights Arrakur in one-on-one combat during the melee, but is defeated and disarmed by him. Before Arrakur can deliver the killing blow, however, Taramis stabs him in the back, killing him. Amethea and Argan are reunited and celebrate the liberation of the city from Arrakur's tyranny. == Cast == * Lana Clarkson as Amethea * Katt Shea as Estrild * Frank Zagarino as Argan * Dawn Dunlap as Taramis * Susana Traverso as Tiniara * V√≠ctor B√≥ as Strymon * Arman Chapman as Arrakur * Andrea Barbieri as Zoraida (as Andrea Barbizon) * Tony Middleton as Zohar * Andrea Scriven as Dariac * Robert Carson as Shibdiz * Matilde Mur as Eunuco * Eddie Pequenino as Vendedor (as Eddie Little) * Patrick Duggan as Shaman * Lucy Tiller as Orellia * Ivan Green as Karax * Theodore McNabney as Cerus (as Theo McNabney) * Richard R.

CBS News, May 7, 2004. == Release == Barbarian Queen had a limited theatrical release on April 26, 1985.Variety, Wednesday, April 3, 1985, pg. 7. Vestron Video originally released two versions of the film on VHS: the R-rated theatrical cut, and an unrated edition that contained an extended version of the dungeon sequence. All subsequent DVD releases only contained the R-rated cut.Manion, Dominique and James Ursini. The Modern Amazons: Warrior Women On- Screen. Pompton Plains: Amadeus Press, 2006, pg. 342. The Shout!Factory DVD release contains the unrated material as a bonus feature. == Reception == B-movie critic Joe Bob Briggs gave the film a tongue-in-cheek positive review, writing, \\"It's no Conan the Barbarian II, but it's got what it takes, namely: Forty-six breasts, including two on the male lead. Thirty-one dead bodies. Heads roll. Head spills. Three gang rapes. Women in chains. Orgy. Slave-girl sharing. One bird's-nest bra. The diabolical garbonza torture. Sword fu. Torch fu. Thigh fu (you have to see it to believe it).\\"'Barbarian Queen' B.q. Is No Conan, But She's About As Good As Argentina Gets. Orlando Sentinel May 5, 1985 Roman Martel of DVD Verdict wrote that the film is enjoyable but problematic for its misogyny.DVD Verdict R. L. Shaffer of IGN called it an unintentionally funny Conan the Barbarian ripoff. TV Guide rated it 2/5 stars and wrote that despite the film's exploitative content, Olivera \\"inject[s] some style and pace to the rather silly goings-on\\". Stuart Galbraith IV of DVD Talk wrote that the film \\"isn't all that terrible\\" and appeals to its target audience. Several critics have commented upon the ambiguity of the film's seemingly feminist narrative and the exploitative nature of its many scenes of female rape, nudity, and bondage. Variety‚Äôs review of the film suggested the \\"Concept of female warriors besting male opponents on the battlefield is unconvincing as presented, with the gals more effective as sex objects‚Ä¶Emphasis on rape and torture is overdone.\\"Film Review: Barbarian Queen. Variety, Wednesday, December 18, 1985, pg. 16. In The Modern Amazons: Warrior Women On-Screen, Dominique Mainon and James Ursini note the film follows a \\"pseudo-feminine empowerment storyline‚Ä¶In the course of the quest, however, Amethea is caught, stripped down to a pair of thong panties, and bound to a torture device for an unusually long portion of the movie.\\"Mainon and Ursini, pg. 342 That the movie's centerpiece is the extended sequence of the supposedly empowered Amethea's topless, BDSM-inflected torture/interrogation has prompted readings of the film as \\"a delicate postfeminist balance of three discordant elements: a timid rape-and-bondage spectacle, an incoherent feminism, and a very patriarchal plot structure...a feminist narrative arc ostensibly motivates rape imagery.\\"Andrews, David. Soft in the Middle: The Contemporary Softcore Feature in its Contexts. Columbus: Ohio State University Press, 2006, pg. 101. Rikke Schubart suggests the culmination of the dungeon sequence ‚Äì in which Amethea literally crushes the torturer's penis with her pelvic muscles ‚Äì represents a genuine \\"feminist dislocation\\" of gender codes, which takes images \\"of the female rape-victim as weak and helpless and relocates them‚Ä¶as rape-victim being dangerous and lethal.\\" However, Schubart's discussion also implies that the feminism is at least partially mitigated by the sequence's eroticized use of bondage imagery and the objectified presentation of Clarkson's nudity: \\"Men have no problem identifying with men as victims and women as castrators if this happens in an erotic context where it is obvious that the woman is there to be looked at.\\"Schubart, Rikke.

Jefferson: McFarland, 2007, pg. 228-229. ==Sequels Barbarian Queen II === A follow- up film, Barbarian Queen II: The Empress Strikes Back was billed as a sequel, when in actuality neither the plot nor the characters had anything to do with the original Barbarian Queen film apart from featuring Lana Clarkson in the title role, and including a protracted sequence where her character is captured, stripped, and tortured on a rack. Principal photography took place in Mexico in 1988; however the film was not released in the U.S. until 1992, when it went straight-to-video.\\"Focus on Latin America: Films Shot in Mexico in 1988.\\" Variety May 10, 1989, pg. 476.\\"1992 U.S. Film Releases.\\" Variety Feb. 24, 1992, pg. 16 ===Wizards of the Lost Kingdom II=== Lana Clarkson reprised the role of Amethea as a supporting character in the PG-rated Wizards of the Lost Kingdom II (1989), which features recycled footage of battle scenes from Barbarian Queen. Despite this, there is no apparent connection to the plot of Barbarian Queen, and the Amethea that appears in Wizards of the Lost Kingdom 2 is arguably not the same character that Clarkson played in Barbarian Queen. ===Proposed third film=== In 1990 it was announced that Barbarian Queen III: Revenge of the She-King would film in Bulgaria; however the project was never completed.\\"East Bloc Film Makers Have Liberty to Say What They Truly Mean.\\" New York Times, April 30, 1990. == Legacy == Roger Corman reportedly claimed in later years that the title character was an inspiration for Xena: Warrior Princess.‚ÄúWoman found dead in home of Phil Spector identified as B-movie actress.‚Äù Associated Press, Feb. 5, 2003. == References == == External links == * * *film page at Lana Clarkson website *Barbarian Queen II review at Entertainment Weekly *Barbarian Queen II at TCMDB Category:1985 films Category:1980s fantasy films Category:American films Category:American fantasy films Category:Argentine fantasy films Category:Argentine films Category:Spanish-language films Category:Films scored by Christopher Young Category:Films directed by H√©ctor Olivera Category:Films about rape Category:American multilingual films Category:Argentine multilingual films Category:1980s multilingual films ","title":"Barbarian Queen"},{"id":"9109463","text":"PLADES (meaning \\"Labor Program to Development\\" as an acronym in Spanish) is an NGO from Peru.

A 3D-animated film about Bhai Taru Singh was released globally on 27 April 2018. ==Biography== Bhai Taru Singh was born around 1720 into a Sandhu Jat family in Amritsar during the reign of the Mughal Empire. He was raised as a Sikh by his widowed mother and had one sister, Tar Kaur. Singh was engaged in agriculture at Poolha, Kasur, Lahore District, where he had a small farm and grew maize. Upon witnessing Sikh fighters save a poor girl from the clutches of the Mughal oppressors, Bhai Taru Singh decided to become initiated into the Khalsa. During this time, Sikh revolutionaries were plotting the overthrow of the Mughal governor of Punjab, Zakaria Khan. Singh and his sister gave food and other aid to the gursikhs (devout Sikhs of the Guru). An informant reported them to Zakaria Khan and the two were arrested for treason. Some sources, however, say that a mahant (akin to a 'great priest') was the one to have tipped off Mughal authorities because Bhai Taru Singh was harboring Sikh fighters. Though his sister's freedom was bribed for by the villagers, Singh refused to seek a pardon. After a period of imprisonment and torture, Bhai Taru Singh was brought before the Khan and asked him where he got his powers from to undergo all of the agony. His reply was through his keshas ('unshorn hair') blessed by Guru Gobind Singh. Zakaria Khan then gave him the choice of either execution or conversion to Islam and having his hair cut off as an offering. Upon his refusal to forsake his religion, in a public display, Bhai Taru Singh's scalp was cut away from his skull with a sharp knife to prevent his hair from ever growing back. According to prominent early Sikh historian Ratan Singh Bhangu, in response to having his scalp torn off, Taru Singh cursed Zakaria Khan, saying he would be killed by his shoes. According to Sikh sources, after cutting Singh's scalp, Zakaria Khan was stricken with unbearable pain and the inability to urinate. As a last resort, Khan sent an apology to the Khalsa Panth for his persecution of Sikhs and begged for forgiveness. It was suggested that if Khan hit himself with Singh's shoes, his condition might be lifted. Although it would cure Khan of his condition, he died 22 days later from having hit himself with the shoes, just as Singh predicted. Upon hearing that he had outlived the Khan, Bhai Taru Singh died on 1 July 1745. ==Legacy== In AD 1762, the Bhangi Sikh Sardar army conquered Lahore and took over the public square where Singh was scalped. The Abdullah Khan Mosque adjacent to the square was also occupied and converted into Shaheed Ganj Gurdwara.Masjid Shahid Ganj Mosque vs Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak ... on 2 May 1940 On the location today, Gurudwara Shaheed Bhai Taru Singh in Naulakha Bazaar, marks the place where Singh's scalp and hair was removed. === Pop culture === * A print representing Singh's martyrdom is present in the 2007 film The Darjeeling Limited, in a scene set in a Sikh temple.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xc0rHJ3zY7A * A 3D-animated film about Bhai Taru Singh was released globally on 27 April 2018, directed by Vismaad Singh. ==See also== * Gurudwara Shaheed Bhai Taru Singh * List of Sikhs * Sikh holocaust of 1746 ==References== ==External links== * Bhai Taru Singh - Animated Film Category:Sikh martyrs Category:Punjabi people Category:1720 births Category:1745 deaths Category:Executed Indian people Category:People executed for refusing to convert to Islam ","title":"Bhai Taru Singh"},{"id":"9109482","text":"Lumsden was a provincial electoral division for the Legislative Assembly of the province of Saskatchewan, Canada.

It was not ported to any home systems. ==Gameplay== The player uses a four-position joystick to maneuver a dog through a maze and avoid several wandering squid. The maze is filled with gates of varying sizes that slow the player's movement while passing through them. The player must pick up fish as they appear, then press a button to drop them and lure the squid toward the gates. Tunnels allow the player to move from the left side to the right and vice versa; some tunnels are permanently open, while others have barriers that periodically open and close. When a squid eats a fish, it increases in size. If a squid comes to a gate that is too small for it to fit through, it becomes stuck for a short time, during which the player can destroy it by running into it. Doing so causes a small cabin to appear near the center of the maze. The player must then touch this cabin, causing it to disappear and revealing a portion of a picture in the large center square. Once the entire picture is revealed, the player moves on to the next level. One life is lost if the dog touches a squid not caught in a gate. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1982 video games Category:Arcade games Category:Arcade-only games Category:Maze games ","title":"Devil Fish (video game)"},{"id":"9109515","text":"Straight from the Heart may refer to: ==Music== * Straight from the Heart (David Houston and Tammy Wynette album), 1971 * Straight from the Heart (Patrice Rushen album), 1982 * Straight from the Heart (Peabo Bryson album), 1984 * Straight from the Heart (The Gap Band album), 1988 * Straight from the Heart: The Very Best of Bonnie Tyler, 1995 * Straight from the Heart (Daryle Singletary album), 2007 * \\"Straight from the Heart\\" (The Allman Brothers Band song), 1981 * \\"Straight from the Heart\\" (Bryan Adams song), 1983 * \\"Straight from the Heart\\" (Doolally song), 1998 * \\"Straight from the Heart\\", a song by S Club from the album Seeing Double, 2002 ==Film== * Straight from the Heart (1935 film), American drama film directed by Scott R.

He currently plays in British rock trio Guy McCoy Torm√© with former Gillan/Ozzy guitarist Bernie Torm√© and Bruce Dickinson/Sack Trick drummer Robin Guy. He is also an accomplished guitar, drum, trumpet, cello, and double bass player. Nearly as well known as his music is his appearance: he is always pictured wearing sunglasses, with the striking contrast of bald head and robust chin beard. Along with guitarist Vic Elmes and ZZebra colleague Liam Genockey on drums, McCoy can also be heard playing in the intro and end titles theme of the 1970s cult TV series Space: 1999. ==Early career== In the 1960s, when he was 13, whilst still at school, McCoy began playing as lead guitarist with a working beat group, The Drovers. In 1966 he responded to an advertisement in the Yorkshire Post newspaper for a guitarist to join a band called Mamas Little Children who were about to begin touring Germany. McCoy went to audition only to find they had just given someone else the position, but still needed a bass player. He auditioned on a spare bass that was there and was given the job. In 1968 he was forced to resign from the band because he was working illegally underage. On his return to Britain, he went to London where he found work as a session musician with former Drifters member Clyde McPhatter touring the UK. In 1974, McCoy was playing with London-based band Scrapyard when they recruited Irish-born lead guitarist Bernie Torm√©. Although Torm√© eventually left to form his own punk rock band, the two were later reunited in former Deep Purple singer Ian Gillan's band. On 18 July 2009, John McCoy performed at the Furnace in Swindon Wiltshire, England Performing in a group G.M.T with Bernie Torm√© (guitar legend formerly with Gillan, and Ozzy Osbourne) Robin Guy (former drummer with Iron Maiden's Bruce Dickinson and Faith No More). More recently John has played with the Tyler Gang, appearing on a live album recorded in Sweden. John McCoy later went on to release, \\"Trash Basket and Tip-Toe Titters,\\" in a famed attempt to crack into the experimental bass genre. ==Career with Gillan== In July 1978, the jazz-rock fusion Ian Gillan Band were altering direction, under the influence of keyboards player Colin Towns in a return to Ian Gillan's hard rock roots. Towns had begun writing new material, and Gillan gave him the task of recruiting the new line-up. Towns recruited session drummer Liam Genockey, McCoy and guitarist Richard Brampton, who was replaced by Steve Byrd - a former colleague of McCoy's from ZZebra - almost immediately. Within a month of their formation the band had recorded their first album, Gillan, and they made their live debut at the Reading Festival on 16 August 1978. They were originally listed there as the Ian Gillan Band but, in a move away from the jazz-rock connotations, they renamed the band, Gillan. Gillan underwent a further three line-up changes, but McCoy remained as bass player until the band eventually split acrimoniously in 1982. ==Mammoth== Post-Gillan, McCoy recruited session drummer Vinnie \\"Tubby\\" Reed, guitarist \\"Big\\" Mac Baker and vocalist Nicky Moore to form a band initially called Dinosaur. The name was already in use by a Californian band, so McCoy renamed his new band Mammoth. The name was also a tongue-in-cheek reference to the large size of the band members: McCoy weighed , Reed , Baker , and Moore . The band toured with Whitesnake and Marillion and were well received by fans. They released one single, \\"Fatman\\", and two albums, Mammoth and Larger And Live. In 1988, the entire band appeared in the film Just Ask For Diamond, playing the henchmen. Musically, commercial success eluded them however and the band eventually split in 1989, with McCoy becoming an independent producer. ==Equipment== McCoy usually uses a traditional four string fretted Fender Precision bass and predominantly Marshall amplification in various configurations.

In his later years, he turned from Marxist socialism to the libertarian socialist doctrine of anarcho-communism. He is best remembered as the father of the term \\"anarcho-syndicalism\\". == Biography  Early years === Known to his contemporaries as Sam, Mainwaring was born 15 December 1841 in Penrhiwtyn, Neath, Wales. He was a native speaker of Welsh and retained an affinity for the tongue throughout his life.Mat Kavanagh, \\"Some Little Known Anarchists: Sam Mainwaring,\\" Freedom, 1934. Reprinted in KSL: Bulletin of the Kate Sharpley Library, no. 9 (1997). Mainwaring was raised by his family as a Unitarian. He developed into a quiet yet persuasive public speaker and a tireless worker for activities which he believed important. Mainwaring was a member of the Amalgamated Engineering Union.Tom Mann, Tom Mann's Memoirs. London: Labour Publishing Co., 1923; pg. 47. === Political career === Late in the 1870s, Mainwaring joined the East London Labour Emancipation League and was an early member of the Social Democratic Federation. However, this group proved to be a disappointment, failing to garner support of an appreciable section of the working class and was believed by many members to overly dominated by the intellectual pretensions and nationalist political views of its patriarch and patron, Henry Hyndman. In 1885, there came a split in which Mainwaring joined with Eleanor Marx, Ernest Belfort Bax and his friend William Morris in forming the Socialist League. Mainwaring was a foreman of a shop which employed Tom Mann and exerted a political influence upon him. Over time, Mainwaring's views gradually evolved from revolutionary socialism to those of anarcho-communism. In 1891, Mainwaring moved to Swansea and there started the Swansea Socialist Society. He became associated with the fledgling anarchist newspaper Liberty, edited by J. Tochatti, formerly of the Hammersmith branch of the Socialist League. In September 1903 and March 1904, Mainwaring published two issues of a short-lived newspaper called The General Strike, a publication which made detailed criticisms of the \\"officialism\\" of union bureaucracy and which publicised strikes in Europe making use of syndicalist tactics.\\"The Great Dock Strike of 1889,\\" Direct Action #47,\\" August 11, 2009. Retrieved March 8, 2010. === Death and legacy === In his later years, Mainwaring lived in London. On Sunday, 29 September 1907, while addressing a meeting on Parliament Hill Fields, Mainwaring was stricken by faintness and subsequently died. He was 55 years old at the time of his death. Mainwaring is credited with coining the phrase \\"anarcho-syndicalism\\" and it is for this he is best remembered. Mainwaring was cited as a major intellectual inspiration by the radical British labour leader Tom Mann. In his 1923 memoirs, Mann credited Mainwaring with having been \\"one of the very first to understand the significance of the revolutionary movement, and the first, as far as my knowledge goes, to appreciate industrial action as distinct from parliamentary action\\". Mainwaring was the namesake of a nephew whom he adopted, Sam Mainwaring Jr., himself an important radical activist in the international labour movement.Ken John, \\"Sam Mainwaring and the Autonomist Tradition,\\" Llafur, vol. 4, no. 3 (1986). == Footnotes == == Further reading == * Kenneth John. \\"Anti-Parliamentary Passage: South Wales and the Internationalism of Sam Mainwaring (1841‚Äì1907)\\".

There is no Palestinian constituency of consequence that would agree to the renunciation of this right. There is also no Jewish constituency of consequence in Israel that would accept the return of millions of Palestinian refugees... The challenge for the Israeli and Palestinian national leaderships is to arrive at a formula that recognizes refugee rights but which does not contradict the basis of a two-state solution and an end to the conflict.\\"Statement of Principles on the Palestinian Refugee Issue ATFP website. ==Humanitarian efforts== ATFP launched the Palestinian Humanitarian Fund appeal in May 2006. On January 23, 2007, ATFP launched a humanitarian medical program in the West Bank. ===American charities for Palestine=== In June 2007, members of the ATFP Board of Directors established a sister organization, American Charities for Palestine (ACP). ACP is pioneering a new approach for distributing secure donations to worthy causes that will help build both peace and Palestine. ACP is designated by the IRS as 501 (c) (3) nonprofit organization. In August 2008, ACP signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) ensuring that all recipients of ACP donations in Palestine are fully vetted and approved by USAID. This is the first such agreement between USAID and any private organization, and it was described by USAID Administrator Henrietta Fore as a ‚Äúhistoric step.‚Äù ACP donors are therefore assured that their generosity will be distributed in full compliance with US law as well as reaching truly deserving recipients. ACP focuses primarily on the fields of health and education. These two sectors are not only central to the immediate improvement of the quality of life for Palestinians, but also indispensable for laying the foundations of a viable future Palestinian state to live alongside Israel. In targeting these two sectors, ACP hopes to advance the cause of peace based on two states ‚Äì Israel and Palestine ‚Äì and to support efforts by the United States government to realize this crucial policy goal. In its humanitarian projects, ACP works directly with Palestinian and international charities, as well as USAID and Palestinian Authority agencies. Since signing its partnership agreement with USAID, ACP has started three charitable initiatives benefiting Palestinians in the West Bank, with amounts totaling $605,000 in contributions. ACP is committed to making a strategic impact on the quality of education and health care delivery to Palestinians. ACP's partnership with USAID has created a mechanism that reassures donors, vets recipients and provides accountability and transparency. This unique package of safeguards, partnerships and services is particularly suited to attract donors who have an interest in promoting peace and security. ACP believes there is an intimate connection between improving living conditions and providing hope and the reality of a secure peace between Israel and Palestine. ==Publications== In 2006, ATFP published a volume summarizing its efforts and positions to date, Principles and Pragmatism: Key Documents from the American Task Force on Palestine, edited by board member Saliba Sarsar, associate vice president of Monmouth University, and Hussein Ibish, a senior fellow at the task force. The task force had previously issued its ‚ÄúPalestine ‚Äì Israel 101‚Äù power-point slideshow on the history of the conflict and prospects for peace in the region. ATFP has also created a brief video on the history of Palestinian Americans, ‚ÄúSnapshots of Palestinian Americans.‚Äù In 2009, ATFP Senior Fellow Hussein Ibish published the book What‚Äôs Wrong with the One-State Agenda? (ATFP, 2009). It offers a critique from a pro-Palestinian point of view of the idea of creating a single state for all Israelis and Palestinians instead of the goal of ending the occupation and forging a negotiated peace agreement with Israel. ATFP has also published numerous issue and policy analysis papers. ==Criticism== In a July 20, 2007, article published by The Electronic Intifada, Palestinian commentator Osamah Khalil called for a boycott of officials and institutions associated with the Palestinian Authority, \\"including diplomatic fronts like the American Task Force on Palestine, a group that boasts among its slim record of 'achievements,' sponsoring polo matches and hosting a speech by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.\\"Reclaiming Palestine Accessed August 4, 2007 Khalil viewed the Palestinian Authority as fundamentally antithetical to the goal of Palestinian liberation. In March 2005, dozens of organizations representing Palestinian refugee communities signed a statement in response to statements made by ATFP president Ziad Asali \\"declaring that various statements and false representations by the president of the Washington-based \\"American Task Force on Palestine\\" (ATFP) Dr. Ziad Asali nullifying the Palestinian right to return and demeaning the Palestinian and Arab people are reprehensible and entirely outside the consensus of our people.\\" The statement alleged that \\"voices such as Asali's are part of a larger concerted effort to introduce a false veneer of moderation as a replacement for the legitimate inalienable rights of the Palestinian and Arab people, represented by their right to return, sovereignty and self-determination.\\".Palestinian Associations Worldwide Condemn Ziad Asali's Statements Accessed August 5, 2007 In 2007, ATFP answered many of its most persistent criticisms in an issue paper addressing a wide range of attacks against the organization. ==Board of directors== * Ziad J.

In 1823 he obtained his doctorate in Paris, where he subsequently worked as a hospital surgeon. Following the death of Alexis de Boyer (1757-1833), he was appointed chair of clinical surgery, a position he maintained until his death in 1867.

Among his better known written efforts was a work on obstetrics, titled Trait√© elementaire de l‚Äôart des accouchements: ou, Principes de tokologie et d'embryologie (1829). Shortly afterwards, it was translated into English and issued as \\"An elementary treatise on midwifery: or Principles of tocology and embryology\\" (1831).

Written by Philippe Labro, the article was titled \\"La Peur qui vient du futur\\" (\\"The Fear from the Future\\") and told the story of two American families who had been exposed to high levels of radioactivity after breaking a pill. He jotted down a number of notes about the proposed story: :A bottle (or some other object) containing a deadly substance (atomic pills? See Marie-France) has been carried off (by mistake) by someone. Tintin pursues the fellow and finds him just as the substance in question is about to unleash its damaging effects. He turned the project over to staff at Studios Herg√© to work on, with the cartoonist Greg developing two plot synopsis for two stories, Les Pilules (\\"The Pills\\") and Tintin et le Thermoz√©ro (\\"Tintin and the Thermozero\\"). Herg√© took the latter project and produced eight pages of pencil drawings for it. However, Herg√© was uncomfortable with working on a story already plotted out by someone else, commenting that: :I felt like a prisoner in a straitjacket unable to get out. Personally, I need to be constantly surprised by my own inventions. Besides, my stories are always created in the same way. I know my starting point, and I know more or less where I want to end up, but the route I take to get there depends on my whim of the moment. According to Herg√© biographer Beno√Æt Peeters, the problem with Greg's outlines was that he had \\"absorbed the style of The Adventures of Tintin to the point of imitating it.\\" Unwilling to abandon a good idea, Herg√© planned to make Le Thermoz√©ro the plot of the third filmed adventure of Tintin but once again, this did not take place. Bob de Moor, Herg√©'s assistant, was asked to change the synopsis and make it the sixth Jo, Zette and Jocko adventure. After a few sketches were made this project fell through as well, as Herg√© asked Bob de Moor to modernize The Black Island instead. Herg√© then turned his attention to The Castafiore Emerald, which saw book publication in 1963. In March 2014 it was revealed that de Moor had indeed written a complete script for Le Thermoz√©ro and that more pages had been pencilled before the project was shelved. Tintin's publisher Casterman also announced plans to publish an edition of Le Thermoz√©ro, possibly in the same vein as the other unfinished Tintin adventure Tintin and Alph-Art.Akhtar, Zainab. \\"Tintin Thermoz√©ro: everything you need to know about the 'new Tintin',\\" Comics & Cola (26 March 2014). ==Synopsis== On a rainy day, Haddock, Tintin and Calculus have a car accident with a German they had had words with a few minutes before. Tintin, ready to help people, draws him out of his car and covers him with his coat. Surprisingly, many people try to put the man in their own car before the ambulance arrives. He hides an object in Tintin's coat without anyone's knowledge. Finally, the ambulance arrives and everyone goes home. Back at the hotel, Calculus decides to bring Tintin's coat to the laundry. A few days later, Tintin and the Captain discover that everyone present at the accident has been burgled. Apparently, the people behind all this are looking for an item that previously belonged to the victim. The next day, Haddock is kidnapped and the message for the ransom is \\"Haddock for the item\\". A meeting is set in Berlin. Though unaware of what the item is, the heroes travel to Germany to get Haddock back. With a case in his hand, Tintin meets the kidnappers. A few minutes later they are all jailed, as Tintin's case carried a transmitter. Back in Marlinspike, Calculus discovers the item (an explosive that functions in spaces without oxygen) cannot work as one ingredient is missing. == Pastiches == There are several partly completed versions of the unfinished album. Today, the most famous is page 4 of Yves Rodier. ‚Ä¢ Ralph Edenbag Edenbag has already drawn several pastiche comics around Tintin and Co. At the beginning of the 2000s, he inked and coloured pages 2 to 7 according to Herg√©'s designs. He also drew several cover versions. ‚Ä¢Studio Juhis Inked version of page 5, but without text. The \\"Studio Juhis\\" also drew a cover for this story. ‚Ä¢Yves Rodier Rodier inked page 4 at the end of the 1990s. Meanwhile, Rozier's page is also available in color. ‚Ä¢Jiv√©hem Jiv√©hem is a good friend of Rodier. In 2017, he was the first to release the Thermoz√©ro story as an album with a preface by Yves Rodier. ==ReferencesFootnotes=Bibliography=== * Category:1960 comics debuts Category:Tintin books Category:Unfinished books ","title":"Le Thermoz√©ro"},{"id":"9109829","text":"The Lavoisier Group is an Australian organisation formed by politicians and dominated by retired industrial businesspeople and engineers.\\"The global warming sceptics.\\" Theage.com.au.

Ian Webber, Ray Evans, Harold Clough (current Director of Institute of Public Affairs),https://ipa.org.au/people/harold-clough  Harold Clough ipa.org.au Robert Foster and Bruce Kean, with an opening address by supporter Hugh Morgan.The Lavoisier Group: 'Opening Address' by Hugh Morgan Secretary Ray Evans describes the 90-odd Lavoisier members as a \\"dad's army\\" of mostly retired engineers and scientists from the mining, manufacturing and construction industries, such as Garth Paltridge and Ian Plimer. The annual subscription fee is 50 dollars, and the annual budget is 10,000 dollars. ==Aims== The Lavoisier Group lists its aims as: # To promote vigorous debate within Australia on greenhouse science and greenhouse policy; # To ensure that the full extent of the economic consequences, for Australia, of the regime of carbon withdrawal prescribed by the yet-to-be-ratified Kyoto Protocol, are fully understood by the Australian community; # to explore the implications which treaties such as the Kyoto Protocol have for Australia's sovereignty, and for the GATT/WTO rules which protect Australia (and other WTO members) from the use of trade sanctions as an instrument of extraterritorial power. ==Views== Walsh has blamed politics for the current consensus on global warming. The group claims that many scientists choose to endorse prevailing theories of global warming to protect their research funding by the government, a view that is held by French climatologist and author Marcel Leroux, and was the subject of the book Meltdown: The Predictable Distortion of Global Warming by Scientists, Politicians, and the Media by Patrick Michaels. A supporter, former minister Tony Staley, has characterised global warming as a form of \\"political correctness\\". ==Responses== Author Clive Hamilton, in his book Scorcher, says that one can find the following arguments in the various papers promoted by the Lavoisier Group: *There is no evidence of global warming. *If there is evidence of global warming, then it is not due to human activity. *If global warming is occurring and it is due to human activity, then it is not going to be damaging. *If global warming is occurring and it is due to human activity, and it is going to be damaging, then the costs of avoiding it are too high, so we should do nothing. Critics of the group have pointed out its ties to greenhouse gas emitters. The group's top members have denied receiving compensation from industry, unlike some global warming skeptics in the United States, who have admitted to receiving compensation by fossil fuel companies. ==References== ==External links== * The Lavoisier Group website * Sourcewatch The Lavoisier Group Category:Climate change denial Category:Organizations established in 2000 Category:Organizations of environmentalism skeptics and critics Category:Political advocacy groups in Australia ","title":"Lavoisier Group"},{"id":"9109831","text":"Davide Marchini (born 23 February 1981) is an Italian footballer who plays for SPAL in Prima Divisione. ==Career== Marchini joined Chievo in 2003 on free transfer after the bankrupt of Alzano.

It took the group all over North America to spread the news of their \\"Family Values\\" platform to hordes of fans at special \\"fan conferences\\" that were organized at every stop along the tour route. Korn chartered a jet, which took them to record stores in such cities as Riverside, CA, Mt. View, CA, Sacramento, Seattle, Minneapolis, Chicago, Detroit, Philadelphia, Boston, New York City, Toronto, Atlanta, and Dallas. The band talked to fans at every stop, answered questions during the special \\"fan conferences\\" and signed autographs. Jim Rose hosted the entire \\"Korn Kampaign\\" tour. Celebrities at various stops included Ice Cube and Todd McFarlane. == Success == The 1998 edition of the Family Values Tour was highly successful. The DVD sold over 1,100,000 copies and achieved platinum record status according to the RIAA. Korn helped to promote then-unknown acts. The results were very promising. Rammstein's album Sehnsucht achieved platinum certification in the United States, also Orgy's debut Candyass achieved similar success. Limp Bizkit enjoyed even greater success which helped them establish themselves as one of the leading acts of the nu metal wave at that time, and enjoyed enormous commercial success. ==Track listing== The DVD release does not feature any of Incubus' songs, unlike the CD release. # \\"Cambodia\\" - Limp Bizkit # \\"Counterfeit\\" - Limp Bizkit # \\"Faith\\"George Michael Cover Song \\\\- Limp Bizkit # \\"Jump Around\\"House of Pain Cover Song \\\\- Limp Bizkit # \\"Check Yo Self\\" - Ice Cube # \\"Fuck Dying\\" - Ice Cube # \\"It Was a Good Day\\" - Ice Cube # \\"Fuck Tha Police\\" - Ice Cube # \\"Blue Monday\\" - Orgy # \\"Stitches\\" - Orgy # \\"Revival\\" - Orgy (feat.

She grew up singing with her musician parents and performing in the school choir. She taught herself guitar, and began writing songs that blend tense, trance-like arpeggios with warm vocals and meditative lyrics about family and nature. Her first recordings were self-released in 2003 as Forest Parade. Her first solo public appearances were at the invitation of fellow Nevada City native Joanna Newsom. She also did a stint in the Nevada City band Black Bear before continuing with her solo pursuits. ==Career== Diane in Tivoli De Helling, 2009 The songs for her album The Pirate's Gospel were written on a trip to Europe. They were recorded in her father‚Äôs studio and were initially self-released in 2004, in paper and lace sleeves with hand lettering. The album was issued in revised form by Holocene Music in October 2006, and received widespread critical acclaim. A new song, \\"Dry Grass and Shadows\\", was issued on a compilation of Nevada City artists, and five more new songs were issued on a limited-edition 10\\" vinyl pressing, Songs Whistled Through White Teeth, released in the United Kingdom in October 2006.

Little is known of the first manor house at Eshott save that in 1310 Roger Mauduit was granted a licence to crenellate his moated house there and that the fortified and moated house was owned by Sir John Heron in 1415. The sparse remains of the moat and some masonry footings have Scheduled Ancient Monument status. In the mid 16th century, the Manor of Eshott passed to the Carr family of Etal, and in about 1660 William Carr built a new manor house to a Palladian style, designed by architect Robert Trollope, about half a mile south of the old manor house. The Carrs were ruined by financial extravagances and in 1792 the estate was sold to Thomas Adams. In 1877, the Hall and estate of some were bought by Emerson Bainbridge, the founder of the Bainbridge Department Store in Newcastle upon Tyne (which later became part of the John Lewis Partnership). In 1881, Bainbridge significantly enlarged and improved the hall. The previous owner, Ho Sanderson, was a great grandson of Bainbridge. Beginning in 1997, he carried out major restoration works and brought the building back into use. It is now operated commercially as a stately home offering accommodation, weddings and conferencing. The present owners are Robert and Gina Parker. ==References== * * Keys to the Past * Daily Telegraph- Hotel Guru ==External links== * Eshott Hall website Category:Grade II listed buildings in Northumberland Category:History of Northumberland Category:Country houses in Northumberland Eshott Castle ","title":"Eshott Hall"},{"id":"9109875","text":"Gustavo Saibt Martins (born 20 July 1979), known as Gustavo Papa or simply Gustavo, is a Brazilian retired footballer who played as a striker, and is a manager. ==Playing career== Gustavo played for Juventude, Internacional and S√£o Caetano in the Campeonato Brasileiro S√©rie A.

Discovered on August 23, 1906, it was named after August Kopff who discovered the comet. The comet was missed on its November 1912 return, but was recovered on its June 1919 return. The comet has not been missed since its 1919 return and its last perihelion passage was on May 25, 2009. Close approaches to Jupiter in 1938 and 1943 decreased the perihelion distance and orbital period. 22P/Kopff‚Äôs next perihelion passage is 18 March 2022. ==Observations== { class= style=\\"text-align:center; font-size:11px; float:right; margin:2px\\" - bgcolor= style=\\"font-size: smaller;\\"  colspan=\\"8\\" style=\\"text- align:center;\\"Perihelion distance at different epochs - !

Kopff analyzed photographic plates which he exposed on August 20, 1903, against pre-discovery images of the same region. On August 23, 1903, Kopff concluded it to be a comet with an estimated apparent magnitude of 11. On mid-September 1906, the short-period nature of the comet was recognized by a team headed by Kiel Ebell of the Berkeley Astronomical Department. The comet was missed when it made a return on November 25, 1912, however on June 25, 1919, astronomers recovered the comet. The comet was located less than three days from the predicted position. Over the next several returns to Earth, none were notable until the 1945 comet‚Äôs return when the comet peaked at magnitude 8.5. The increase in brightness was a result of Jupiter altering the comet‚Äôs orbit between the years of 1939 to 1945. This change in orbit brought the comet closer to the Sun. The 1951 return was unique due to the comet being 3 magnitudes fainter than what was expected when recovered in April 1951. But the comet still reached magnitude 10.5 in October 1951. A very close pass to Jupiter in 1954 increased the comet‚Äôs perihelion distance to 1.52 AU and increased the orbital period to 6.31 years. On November 30, 1994, Carl W. Hergenrother was able to recover the comet at a stellar magnitude of 22.8 using the 1.5-m reflector at the Catalina Sky Survey. The comet reached magnitude 7 during the 1996 perihelion passage. The comet nucleus is estimated to be 3.0 kilometers in diameter with an albedo of 0.05. The nucleus is dark because hydrocarbons on the surface have been converted to a dark, tarry like substance by solar ultraviolet radiation. == References == == External links == * Orbital simulation from JPL (Java) / Ephemeris * Elements and Ephemeris for 22P/Kopff ‚Äì Minor Planet Center * 22P/Kopff at CometBase * 22P ‚Äì Gary W.

The by-election was caused by the resignation on 7 November 1921 of the town's Conservative Party Member of Parliament (MP) Sir Eric Geddes, who had held the seat since 1917, and had come under criticism as Minister of Transport for the scale of nationalisation he had overseen, and over charges of departmental inefficiency. He chose to resign as both cabinet minister and MP. The result was a comfortable victory for the new Conservative candidate Sir George Newton, who held the seat until his elevation to the peerage in 1934 as Baron Eltisley. The election nonetheless saw a sharp fall in the Conservative share of the vote (by over one third) since the 'khaki election' of 1918, although the Conservative vote only actually fell by 656, and Newton's fall in vote share is mainly attributable by a slight rise in the Labour vote, and the appearance of the first Liberal candidate to contest the seat since 1910. Of the two unsuccessful candidates, Hugh Dalton was a Cambridge-educated LSE lecturer in economics who went on to be an MP from 1924, and became Labour's Chancellor under Clement Attlee; and Sydney Cope Morgan was a Cambridge- educated barrister who went on to contest the seat again for the Liberals with an increased vote at each of the next two general elections. All three candidates were contesting the seat for the first time, and Dalton would not contest the seat again. ==Result of the previous general election in Cambridge== ==Result of 16 March 1922 by-election== == References == * == See also == * List of United Kingdom by-elections * Cambridge constituency * 1934 Cambridge by-election * 1967 Cambridge by-election * 1976 Cambridge by- election Category:1922 in England Category:1922 elections in the United Kingdom By-election, 1922 By-election, 1922 Category:By-elections to the Parliament of the United Kingdom in Cambridgeshire constituencies Category:20th century in Cambridge ","title":"1922 Cambridge by-election"},{"id":"9109932","text":"Fyodor Reshetnikov may refer to: *Fyodor Grigoryevich Reshetnikov (1919‚Äì2011) - Soviet physicist and metallurgist *Fyodor Mikhaylovich Reshetnikov (1841‚Äì1871) - Russian writer and novelist *Fyodor Pavlovich Reshetnikov (1906‚Äì1988) - Soviet painter ","title":"Fyodor Reshetnikov"},{"id":"9109945","text":"Sneakin' Sally Through the Alley is the debut solo album by Robert Palmer, released in 1974.

Some later sources confuse the two R√≥n√°ns, but historian Francis John Byrne notes that the earliest sources do not.Francis J.Byrne, Irish Kings, p. 137. ==U√≠ Cheinnselaig king== The first was R√≥n√°n mac Colm√°in (died 624)all dates per The Chronology of the Irish Annals, Daniel P. McCarthy He was King of the U√≠ Cheinnselaig and was the son of Colm√°n mac Cormaicc of the Sil Chormaic sept.Byrne, Irish Kings, table 10. The historian Francis John Byrne believes he was the one who was King of Leinster. His death is mentioned in both the Annals of Tigernach and the Annals of Ulster.Annals of Ulster AU 624.1; Annals of Tigernach AT 625.1. The later Leinster king Crundm√°el Erbuilc mac R√≥n√°in (died 656) was his son. Other sons were Blathmac (died 658) and Cummascach, a King of U√≠ Cheinnselaig. He was succeeded as king of U√≠ Cheinnselaig by Crundm√°el Bolg Luatha mac √Åedo (died 628). ==U√≠ D√∫nlainge king== The second R√≥n√°n mac Colm√°in (died 613) belonged to the U√≠ D√∫nlainge and was the son of Colm√°n M√°r mac Coirpri.Byrne, Irish Kings, table 9. The Annals of Tigernach includes his death obit with the title King of Laigin.Annals of Tigernach, AT 613.4. These annals interpolated dates for some Leinster kings in this period from the king lists. ==Fingal R√≥n√°in saga== R√≥n√°n mac Colm√°in of the U√≠ D√∫nlainge appears in the Fingal R√≥n√°in (The Kinslaying of R√≥n√°n), also known as Aided M√°ele Fothartaig meic R√≥n√°in (The Killing of M√°el Fothartaig mac R√≥n√°in), a Middle Irish language verse tale of the 10th century. The story survives in the Book of Leinster. The protagonist of the tale is named R√≥n√°n mac √Åedo, but genealogies have R√≥n√°n mac Colm√°in as the father and killer of M√°el Fothartaig.A certain R√≥n√°n Crach mac √Åedo D√≠bchine of the U√≠ M√°il of Leinster existed at this time as well. Professor Dan Wiley notes: \\"After R√≥n√°n's death, his line of the family became extinct. Subsequent U√≠ D√∫nlainge kings of Leinster all trace descent from his brother F√°el√°n mac Colm√°in.\\"Dan M. Wiley, \\"Fingal R√≥n√°in\\" , The Cycles of the Kings. According to the saga, R√≥n√°n's first wife was Eithne ingen Chummascaig by whom he had a son named M√°elfothartaig. On Eithne's death he remarried to the daughter of Eochaid Iarlaithe (d. 666) of D√°l nAraide. The new queen was very young and attempted to seduce her stepson. So Maelfothartaig went into voluntary exile in Scotland to avoid this. Eventually he returned home but the queen continued her advances which were refused and she tricked the king into having his son murdered. ==Notes== ==See also== *Kings of Leinster ==References== * Annals of Ulster at CELT: Corpus of Electronic Texts at University College Cork * Annals of Tigernach at CELT: Corpus of Electronic Texts at University College Cork * Byrne, Francis John (2001), Irish Kings and High-Kings, Dublin: Four Courts Press, * Book of Leinster,Rig Laigin at CELT: Corpus of Electronic Texts at University College Cork * MacKillop, James, A Dictionary of Celtic Mythology.

Buh, who settled in Trarza in the 1870s, developed a following in St. Louis, and began a pattern of visits to the peanut basin and river valley. During the last two decades, he gave invaluable service to the administration, service that Dudu Seck, as a functionary, could hardly perform. (Marty 1915‚Äì1916). It was in the late 1860s that Buh established ties with the French administration who were busy in their venture to conquer the Senegalo-Mauritanian zone. At this point he was less than 20 years old. He became a dominant figure in a configuration of teachers, schools and zawiyas (lodges) that stretched across the Sahel and Sahara. He had a huge network of disciples and relations which made him very popular with the French administration for he enjoyed prestige and respect across the frontiers of language, social status and even religious identity. Al Hajj Umar Tal had sought support from Buh's father, however the latter a traditional Qadiriyya and Fadiliyya rejected the hostility and violence that jihad entailed and refused to support Tal's cause. Sheikh Saad Buh was to perform many services for the French including at numerous times saving French explorers from the hands of local bands. He rescued Paul Soleillet, Blanchet and Fabert. Soleillet was rescued from a local band who pillaged his possessions. Buh advised the traveller not to attempt to journey any further into the dangerous Sahelian zone. Buh had ties with the French for more than 50 years. He would go on diplomatic missions for them- such as trying to convince Lat-Dior to let the French build their railway, or to dissuade Ma Ba from warring with the French- he would counsel them as best how to advance in their conquest and he would become an intermediary between the French colonial government and his disciples (talibes). Whenever the French had difficulty in establishing their authority they would call upon him. In return for his aid to the French Buh would seek services from them such as free travel, gifts and aid for his camps in Mauritania. He gained permission from the French to tour Senegal (which was comparatively richer than Mauritania) in order to collect gifts, alms which he re-distributed to his disciples in Mauritania. In 1910 he wrote a letter of counsel to Ma El Inin urging him not to wage war on the French and pointing out that French stability had allowed Islam to spread and acquire stability in the region. This letter would later become famous. He very cleverly used sources from the Koran to demonstrate that Islam should be a pacifist religion and his example would set a precedent to all those marabouts to follow him, who would indulge in similar tactics to prove their allegiance to the French. As a person it is said that he was extremely fat, at times disgruntled but very smart indeed. ==Sources== *Behrman, L.C., Muslim Brotherhoods and Politics in Senegal, Cambridge, 1970. *Kingsbury, K.A., Doctoral Thesis on the Mourides of Senegal, to be published 2009.

The Government's Industrial Research Association invested some effort in adapting the tunnels and galleries for the storage of critical chemicals like tetra- ethyl-lead (petroleum anti-knock). 1937‚Äì1940: Wifo phases I and II to extend the tunnels were completed, and the site stored oil, gasoline, and chemicals; as well as stockpiles of chemical poisons. 1943 July (mid): A production planner for Gerhard Degenkolb (i.e., the A-4 Special Committee), Paul Figge, determined that the site seemed ideal for A-4 production, but Hermann G√∂ring initially forbade the use for missile production (Hitler overruled). 1943 August (end): The Armaments Ministry seized the facility from Hermann G√∂ring's Four-Year Plan organization. 1943 November (late): Mittelwerk GmbH leased the Kohnstein mine from Wifo, the owner. 1943 September early: Albin Sawatzki, Arthur Rudolph, and about ten engineers moved to the Nordhausen plant from Peenem√ºnde. 1943 September: Conversion of tunnels for V-2 rocket production was started. 1944 Spring: Ventilation and heating construction was completed. 1944 May or June: Mittelwerk had to compress all its facilities into tunnels 21-46, disrupting production. 1945 April 11: After previously entering the Nordhausen plant from the North through the Junkers Nordwerke, 3rd US Armored and 104th Infantry Divisions reached the town of Nordhausen on 11 April 1945 and discovered the dead and sick of the Boelcke Kaserne barracks at Mittelbau- Dora. 1945 June: The US Army left the Nordhausen plant as required by JCS Directive 1067/14, with parts, machine tools, and documents (including blueprints for the projected A-9/A-10 intercontinental missile) left for the Soviets. 1948 Summer: The Soviet army demolished both of the entrances of the tunnel system 1995: A new entrance tunnel was dug to former rail Tunnel A. Subsequently, a section of 710 m of the tunnel system was opened for visitors. After the 1990 reunification of Germany, the tunnels were frequently looted by treasure seekers who gained access via the private mine in the north of the Kohnstein. Large parts of the system are flooded by ground water, while other parts have collapsed. Willi Kramer, a German archaeologist and scientist who dived in the tunnel system in 1992 and 1998, estimated that 70 tons of material was stolen. Access through these entrances was secured not until 2004, when the mine went into insolvency. == Tourism and walking == In 1366 the Hohnstein counts had the Schnabelsburg (a castle, later a daytrippers restaurant) built on the Kohnstein. At Maienkopf there was an open-air stage from 1934 which had 500 seats. In more recent times the Kaiser Way (an old military road or Heerstra√üe) runs along the Kohnstein. Nearby is the Karst Trail. Around 550 metres east of the summit and about 600 metres northwest of the former Mittelbau-Dora concentration camp is an open area in the woods where several trails meet and known as the Kom√∂dienplatz. The Kom√∂dienplatz hosts the May festivals of Nordhausen Grammar School (Nordh√§user Gymnasium), founded in 1835; schoolchildren put on Latin comedies. ==References and notes== Category:Hills of Thuringia Category:Nordhausen Category:Mittelbau- Dora concentration camp ","title":"Kohnstein"},{"id":"9110066","text":"Franz Otto Knabe (June 12, 1884 - May 17, 1961), also known as \\"Dutch\\", was an American Major league second baseman from Carrick, Pennsylvania, who played for four teams.

Centered mainly on the actions of the Coalition Provisional Authority, within the Green Zone of Baghdad, Chandrasekaran details the events from the end of the invasion phase of the war until the official transfer of power to the Iraqis and the growing insurgency in the country. In the prologue to the book, Chandrasekaran states that his work does not take a side for or against the United States' invasion of Iraq, simply treating it as a given, and instead focuses purely on examining how the post-invasion occupation was handled. ==Awards== The book was chosen as one of the best non-fiction books of 2006/2007 by Entertainment Weekly, The New York Times and the Los Angeles Times. The book also won the 2007 Samuel Johnson Prize for Non-Fiction and the 2006 Overseas Press Club of America award, and was shortlisted for the Guardian First Book Award 2007. == Film adaptation == The nonfiction book has been adapted into a fictional thriller written by Brian Helgeland and directed by Paul Greengrass.

Already at the age of 11, he was working as an apprentice chef at the local \\"La Croce Bianca\\" restaurant, although his duties were confined to non-cooking odd jobs such as potato peeling and dealing with the trash. He later learned more restaurant skills as an immigrant in Paris and London. On May 9, 1914, at the age of 16, he arrived at Ellis Island aboard La Lorraine, a ship of French registration. ==Career== Boiardi followed his brother Paolo to the kitchen of the Plaza Hotel in New York City, working his way up to head chef. He supervised the preparation of the homecoming meal served by Woodrow Wilson at the White House for 2,000 returning World War I soldiers. His entrepreneurial skill became polished and well known when he opened his first restaurant, Il Giardino d'Italia, whose name translates as \\"The Garden of Italy\\", at East 9th Street and Woodland Avenue in Cleveland, in 1926. The patrons of Il Giardino d'Italia frequently asked for samples and recipes of his spaghetti sauce, so he filled cleaned milk bottles. In 1927, Boiardi met Maurice and Eva Weiner who were patrons of his restaurant and owners of a local self-service grocery store chain. The Weiners helped the Boiardi brothers develop a process for canning the food at scale. They also procured distribution across the United States through their grocery's wholesale partners. Boiardi's product was soon being stocked in markets everywhere ‚Äì the company had to open a factory in 1928 to meet the demands of national distribution. After sauce, their next product was closer to a complete pasta meal, including a canister of grated Parmesan cheese, a box of spaghetti, and a jar of pasta sauce, held together in cellophane plastic wrap. Already then, the company was the largest importer of Italian Parmesan cheese, while also buying tons of olive oil, according to niece Anna Boiardi. Touting the low cost of spaghetti products as a good choice to serve to the entire family, Boiardi introduced his product to the public in 1929. In 1938, production was moved to Milton, Pennsylvania, where they could grow enough tomatoes to serve the factory's needs, which reached 20,000 tons of tomatoes per season at peak production; they also began growing their own mushrooms on location in the plant. Boiardi sold his products under the brand name \\"Chef Boy-Ar-Dee\\" because non-Italians could not manage the pronunciation, including his own sales force: he was quoted as saying that \\"everyone is proud of his own family name, but sacrifices are necessary for progress\\". For producing rations supplying Allied troops during World War II, he was awarded a Gold Star order of excellence from the United States War Department. After struggling with cash flow, compounded by internal family struggles over the ownership and direction of the company in managing rapid internal growth, he sold his brand to American Home Foods, later International Home Foods, for about $5.96 million. Investing the funds in steel mills to produce goods for the Korean War was, in hindsight, an unwise business decision, amid a nationalization and privatization argument. Both steel mills and the government wanted ownership of the steel industry during war production. Boiardi lost money after arguing with the War Department over compensation for the wear and tear on the steel mills. Nonetheless, the American Home investment became profitable, because Chef Boy-Ar-Dee became the leading canned food brand name in the US market. Boiardi appeared in many print advertisements and television commercials for his brand in the 1940s through the 1960s. His last appearance in a television commercial promoting the brand aired in 1979. Boiardi continued developing new Italian food products for the American market until his death in 1985, at which time the Chef Boyardee line was grossing $500 million per year for International Home Foods. Surviving commercials with Boiardi from 1953 are on most Kinescopes of the US soap opera Love of Life from that year. ==Death== Boiardi died of natural causes on June 21, 1985, at age 87 in his home of Parma, Ohio, survived by his wife Helen and son Mario.\\"Mario J. Boiardi\\". The Baltimore Sun. November 27, 1997. He had two grandchildren. He is buried at All Souls Cemetery in Chardon Township, Ohio. ==Legacy== In June 2000, ConAgra Foods acquired International Home Foods. The company continues to use his likeness on Chef Boyardee-brand products, which are still made in Milton, Pennsylvania. ==References== ==Further reading== *Bellamy, Gail Ghetia (2003).

It is long and drains an area of . It drains into Lac Saint-Jean at Pointe-Taillon National Park and is the largest tributary of this lake. The town of P√©ribonka is located on the north shore of Lac St-Jean at the river's mouth. Forestry is the main economic activity in this valley; recreational tourism activities, second; hydroelectricity, third. The surface of the P√©ribonka River is usually frozen from the end of November to the beginning of April, but it is generally safe to drive on the ice from mid-December to the end of March. ==Geography== The Peribonka River springs a short distance west of the Otish Mountains in a swampy area on the granite and muskeg of the Canadian Shield. From there it flows south until Lamarche, forming the boundary between the Maria-Chapdelaine and Le Fjord-du-Saguenay Regional Counties. From Lamarche, it flows west to Lac Saint-Jean. Its basin of comprises about one-third of the entire Saguenay River basin. The P√©ribonka river takes its source from an unidentified small lake, on the southwest side of the Otish Mountains. This source is located south of Naococane Lake, southeast of Lac Conflans, Southeast of Jules-L√©ger Lake, North of P√©ribonka Lake and North of the mouth of the P√©ribonka river. This source is located on the southern slope of the watershed; the other slopes of this line are: * East side: Rivi√®re aux Outardes, * West side: Eastmain River, * North side: Otish River. From its source, the course of the P√©ribonka river descends on entirely in forest zones, according to the following segments: Upper course of the P√©ribonka river (segment of ) * first towards the south-east, then south, up to the P√©ribonka East River (coming from the North-East); * towards the south- east by collecting the √âpervanche River until the outlet of a lake (coming from the North-West); * south to the Savane river (coming from the North); * south to the Grande Loutre River (coming from the North-East); * south-east to a stream (coming from the east); * south-east to the north shore of Onistagane Lake; * towards Ssd-est crossing Onistagane Lake (length: ; altitude: ), to its mouth.

Intermediate course of the P√©ribonka river, downstream of the Manouane River (segment of ) * south to the Sault River (coming from the North-West); * south to the Sec Canal River (coming from the East); * towards the south in a deep valley and bypassing several islands especially at the beginning of the segment, by collecting the Malek River (coming from the East) as well as by collecting the Savard River (coming from the West) until the river narrows; * to the south, forming a slight curve towards the East in the beginning of a narrower segment, up to Langelier stream (coming from the east); * to the south by collecting the Banc de Sable river (coming from the North-West, via Banc de Sable bay), bypassing Br√ªl√©e Island and collecting the Br√ªl√©e River to the mouth of Tchitogama Lake (coming from the East). Lower course of the P√©ribonka river (segment of ) From the mouth of Tchitogama Lake, the course of the river descends on: * towards the south by forming two successive large S, up to the Hay Bay where it collects the Bernab√© river (coming from the North-West), then towards the West to Barnab√© Island; * to the southwest, then to the west by collecting the Belley River (coming from the North) to the Chute du barrage Devil. Note: the surrounding areas of this segment include wetlands; * towards the northwest crossing the Devil's Falls, collecting the discharge (coming from the North) from Morel and Paradis lakes and forming a large S at the end of the segment; * to the south in a widening of the river, collecting the Alex River (coming from the North), the Saint-Ludger River (coming from the North-West), the Michel River (coming from the North-West), the Yellow stream (coming from the Northeast), the Morel stream (coming from the east) and Adric stream (coming from the east); * south-west to the route 169 bridge in the village of Sainte- Monique; * towards the southwest by collecting the Noire River (coming from the East), passing in front of the village of P√©ribonka (north bank), bending towards the south at the end of the segment where it collects the Little P√©ribonka River (coming from the North), to the mouth of the river. Note: in this segment, route 169 crosses the north shore; the Pointe-Taillon National Park extends on the south shore (peninsula leading to the mouth of the P√©ribonka river. The village of P√©ribonka is on the edge of this river, very close to Lac Saint-Jean. The P√©ribonka River flows onto the north shore of lac Saint-Jean at the end of Pointe Taillon; √éle Bouliane blocks the mouth of the P√©ribonka River, at: * to the south-west of the dam \\"Chute du Diable\\" erected upstream on the P√©ribonka river; * north of the dam on the P√©ribonka river upstream of the village of Sainte-Monique; * north-east of the mouth of the Mistassini River (confluence with the Lac Saint-Jean); * north-west of the mouth of lac Saint-Jean (confluence with the Grande D√©charge); * north-west of downtown Alma; * west of downtown Saguenay (city); * west of the mouth of the Saguenay River. From the mouth of the P√©ribonka River, the current crosses Lac Saint-Jean east on , then follows the course of Saguenay River on east to the height of Tadoussac where it merges with the St. Lawrence River. ===Tributaries=== The major tributaries of the Peribonka are (in upstream order): * Little Peribonka River * Alex River * Br√ªl√©e River * Serpent River ** √âtienniche River * Brodeuse River * Lake Peribonka ** Carp River (√† la Carpe) * Saint-Onge River * Cocoumenen River * Bonnard River ** Modeste River * Grande Loutre River ** Michel River ** Courtois River * √âpervanche River * P√©ribonka East River ==History== Historically the Innu indigenous people lived in this area and traveled the river by canoe. By the second half of the 17th century, the river was used by Europeans as an access route to James Bay. The first official reference to the river is from April 16, 1679, in the Register of missions, stating \\"juxt√† fluvium Perib8ka ad lacum Peok8agami\\" (near the river Peribouka at Lake Peokouagami (old name of Lac Saint-Jean)) priest Fran√ßois de Crespieul baptized two children. In October of that year, after investigating the state of English positions on Hudson Bay, Louis Jolliet returned to Quebec City via this route and called it P√©riboca in his manuscript. The spelling changed to Periboaka on Laura's map of 1731 and Periboac on Nicolas Bellin's map of 1755. In 1825, Pascal Tach√© identified it as P√©ribonka and subsequently this name, together with Peribonca, came in general use. While trappers and traders made relatively little use of the Peribonka in the 17th and 18th centuries, the river gained importance in the 19th century. Logging camps were established within its watershed and the river was used to drive logs downstream, and starting in 1887, the first colonizers settled near its mouth. In 1928, the Peribonka River overflowed its banks and flooded several villages. Major development came in the 1940s when Alcan, a leading aluminum producer, needed adequate hydro-electric power supply. From 1941 to 1943, the Chute-des-Passes Dam was built at the south end of Lake P√©ribonka that became a vast reservoir. This was followed by two other dams were built downstream: the Chute-du-Diable from 1950 to 1952, and Chute- √†-la-Savane from 1951 to 1953. The classic novel Maria Chapdelaine by French writer Louis H√©mon is set on the shores of the Peribonka River. == Road access == The route 169 gives access to the north bank of the lower reaches of the P√©ribonka river, between its mouth and the village of Sainte-Monique. The roads of 9th range, 10th range and 12th range serve the peninsula of Sainte- Monique, either opposite the mouth of the Alex River (P√©ribonka River). Route Unifor√™t and Chemin Price Brothers serve the area southeast of the mouth of Tchitogama Lake. The Chute-des Passes path (forest road R0250) gives access to the zec des Passes up the Alex river valley, ie the valley to the West the P√©ribonka River; while the forest road R0253 serves the eastern part of this valley. ==Hydroelectric development== There are 4 hydroelectric power stations on the Peribonka River, 3 of which privately belong to Alcan aluminum smelter: *Chute-du-Diable - built in 1952, 240 MW *Chute-√†-la-Savane - built in 1953, 231 MW *Chute-des-Passes - built in 1959, 854 MW The fourth, the Peribonka Power Station, built and operated by Hydro-Qu√©bec, is directly upstream from the confluence with the Manouane River. It was completed on March 9, 2008, and has a capacity of 385 MW. The dam is high and long, creating a reservoir with an area of .Hydro-Qu√©bec - Am√©nagement hydro√©lectrique de la P√©ribonka. Retrieved 2010-11-26 == Toponymy == The name is derived from the Montagnais word pelipaukau, meaning \\"river digging through the sand\\" or \\"where there is moving sand\\". Certainly known to the Amerindians, who had to fish and hunt in the region, the P√©ribonka river was mentioned for the first time in an official document, the Mission Register, on April 16, 1679. On that day, \\"juxt√† fluvium Perib8ka ad lacum Peok8agami ‚Äù(near the P√©ribonka river at Lac Saint-Jean), Father Fran√ßois de Crespieul baptizes two children. In October of the same year, after investigating the state of the English positions at Hudson Bay, Louis Jolliet returned to Quebec on this route. The famous Canadian explorer also drew the outline on a handwritten map also dating from 1679. He then named the P√©riboca River. This designation remains on the map of Guillaume Delisle (1703), but turns into Periboaka on that of Father Laure (1731) and in Periboac on that of Nicolas Bellin (1755). In 1825, Pascal Tach√© identified the river by Peribonka. Thereafter, this name and the P√©ribonca variant will generally be used. Way of penetration relatively little frequented by trappers and merchants of the XVII and XVIII century, the P√©ribonka sees arriving, in XIXth century, the colonists and the workers of the industry forest. One establishes building sites in its basin and one uses its course for the descent of the logs and, in 1887, the first inhabitants settle near its mouth. In 1928, the river emerged from its bed and flooded, with Lake Saint-Jean, several villages. However, this drama does not prevent the region from thriving. Alcan, a major aluminum producer, is developing P√©ribonka to be more adequately supplied with hydroelectric power. From 1941 to 1943, the Chute-des-Passes dam was built at the southern end of P√©ribonka Lake which became a vast reservoir. Two other dams were erected downstream during the 1950s (Chute-du-Diable from 1950 to 1952 and Chute-√†-la-Savane from 1951 to 1953). The French writer Louis H√©mon (1880-1913) mentions the P√©ribonka river several times in his novel Maria Chapdelaine, written shortly before his death and published in 1916. The Chapdelaine house is also located near the bank of this course of water.Book: \\"Names and places of Quebec\\", work of the Commission de toponymie du Qu√©bec, published in 1994 and 1996 in the form of a printed illustrated dictionary, and in that of a CD made by the Micro-Intel company, in 1997, from this dictionary.

The story concerns a group of Royal Marines and convicts in a penal colony in New South Wales, in the 1780s, who put on a production of The Recruiting Officer. It was first staged at the Royal Court Theatre, London, on 10 September 1988, directed by Max Stafford-Clark. It ran on Broadway in 1991. == Background == In the 1780s, convicts and Royal Marines were sent to Australia as part of the first penal colony there. The play shows the class system in the convict camp and discusses themes such as sexuality, punishment, the Georgian judicial system, and the idea that it is possible for \\"theatre to be a humanising force\\". As part of their research, Stafford-Clark and Wertenbaker went to see a play performed by convicts at Wormwood Scrubs, which proved inspiring: \\"in prison conditions, theatre can be hugely heartening and influential and indeed in prison your options are so limited you can become a born-again Christian, a gym-queen constantly working out, a bird watcher or you become passionate about theatre.\\" The convicts were, at least momentarily, civilized human beings, and they had taken their work very seriously: > The convicts knew their lines absolutely because they had nothing else to do > and they didn't want to waste time with pleasantries; as soon as you came > into the room they started rehearsing. The two hours were very intense > because the time was so valuable and we saw immediately how doing a play > could become absolutely absorbing if you were incarcerated. Most of the characters in the play are based on real people who sailed with the First Fleet, though some have had their names changed. Wertenbaker was able to read the journals of First Fleet members in order to portray them accurately. == Synopsis == In the hold of the convict ship Sirius, the convicts witness an (off-stage) flogging and express fear about their future. In Sydney Cove, an unnamed Aboriginal Australian witnesses the arrival of the first fleet. Throughout the play, he comments on the British settlement's effect on the indigenous populations, reacting with curiosity, confusion, and finally fear. Some time after arriving in Sydney, Governor Arthur Philip, Captain David Collins, Captain Watkin Tench, and Midshipman Harry Brewer debate the purpose of prison: should it be to punish or rehabilitate?; and the nature of criminal tendencies: are they innate or acquired? When Tench mentions that the convicts consider hanging to be \\"entertainment,\\" Philip wonders if they could be offered something else. He suggests that the convicts could stage a play, but nevertheless orders Harry to find a hangman and execute three men who have been convicted of stealing food. After hanging two of the thieves, Harry is plagued by guilt, especially as one of the thieves, Handy Baker, was Harry's rival for the affection of Duckling Smith, a young convict woman. Harry tells Second Lieutenant Ralph Clark about the Governor's idea to have the convicts stage a play and Ralph decides to take this project on, hoping to get the Governor to notice him. Ralph chooses George Farquhar's restoration comedy The Recruiting Officer and holds auditions. Some of the convicts who audition are Meg Long, an aged prostitute; Robert Sideway, a flamboyant pickpocket; the shy Mary Brenham; her more outspoken friend Dabby Bryant; and the hardened criminal Liz Morden. Ralph offers Mary the main female role of Silvia and reluctantly agrees that Dabby can play Rose. Liz Morden is offered the role of Melinda. One evening, the officers discuss theatre, punishment, criminality and morality, and debate the value of Ralph's project. Major Ross, his acolyte Captain Campbell, and the pragmatic Captain Tench express conservative opinions and oppose the play, which is defended vehemently by Philip, Collins and Ralph Clark. Collins conducts a vote and with the majority in favour, Ralph is allowed to start rehearsals. Duckling complains that Harry is always watching her, leaving her no freedom. To appease her, he says that he will let her take part in the play. Dabby and Mary start learning their lines. Mary feels inadequate to play a noble lady, as she is ashamed of having sold herself to a sailor on the ship for food. Dabby argues that Mary was no virgin and that she might otherwise not have survived the voyage. Liz interrupts them and demands to be included, but Dabby becomes resentful when it becomes clear that Liz can't read. Their fight is broken up by James ‚ÄúKetch‚Äù Freeman, the hangman. Freeman visits Ralph in his tent, claims that he is innocent of the murder that got him transported to Australia. He explains why he agreed to take on the office of hangman; having been convicted for stealing food, he was told ‚Äúhang or be hanged‚Äù. He finally begs Ralph for a part in the play. A Jewish convict, John Wisehammer, engages Mary in a conversation about the meanings and sounds of words; she suggests he also take part in the play. At the first rehearsal, two actors, Kable and Arscott, are missing; Sideway overacts, and Liz can't act at all. A convict named Black Caesar arrives and asks to play a servant. The rehearsal is interrupted by Ross and Campbell, who inform Ralph that Cable and Arscott have escaped. Ross arrests Caesar, who initially went with the escapees but came back. He also arrests Wisehammer, because Cable was last seen near Wisehammer‚Äôs hut; and Liz, accused of helping Cable steal food from the stores. The rehearsal is left in shambles. In prison, Liz tells Wisehammer her life story. Wisehammer protests that he is innocent. Caesar dreams of making another escape attempt and returning to Madagascar. John Arscott, who has been recaptured, desperately cries out that escape is impossible. Sideway, Duckling and Mary arrive in prison so they can continue to rehearse. Ralph tells Philip that, because half of his actors are in prison, he wants to stop the play, but Philip exhorts him to continue trying, making Ralph see the much larger meaning that the play has for the colony. Philip especially advocates for Liz Morden, as he wants to make an example of her ‚Äì through redemption. In his tent, Harry Brewer sees the ghosts of the two men he hanged, including his rival Handy Baker. He shouts for Duckling, but when she arrives, he cannot trust her, saying that the \\"ghost\\" told him that Handy and Duckling had been on the beach together. On Philip‚Äôs orders, Ross brings Wisehammer, Caesar, and Liz to the second rehearsal. Nobody feels comfortable rehearsing in Ross's presence and Ralph tries to get him to leave. This just infuriates Ross. He starts humiliating the convicts, forcing Sideway to show his flogging scars, Dabby to imitate a dog and Mary to show the tattoo high up on her inner thigh. As the rehearsal continues, Sideway and Liz begin to enter more fully into their parts, boldly using the full length of the room and interacting with the others. The words of the play take a double meaning highly significant to the situation. In response, Ross orders Campbell to flog Arscott as punishment for his escape; the sounds of the flogging and Arscott's cries end the rehearsal. Liz has been sentenced to death for stealing food. Freeman reluctantly measures her for hanging. Harry, who oversees the process, still hears the ghosts of the dead. It becomes clear that Liz did not defend herself at her trial, but just as 'Ketch' and Harry are about to leave, she asks Harry to tell Ralph that she did not steal the food. As they question her as to why she didn't speak up, Harry collapses. As Kable is not back, Ralph has taken over his part in The Recruiting Officer. It is clear by now that Wisehammer and Ralph are rivals for Mary‚Äôs affection, just as they are for Silvia‚Äôs in the Farquhar play. Dabby complains that she can't relate to her character, but Wisehammer argues that a play should teach you something new. Arscott remarks that the play allows him to forget about own situation, contrasting with Dabby, who wants to play herself. The arrival of Ketch Freeman ends the rehearsal, as the others refuse to act with a hangman. In Harry Brewer‚Äôs tent, Duckling promises love and fidelity to Harry, only to discover that he has just died. She collapses. Mary is rehearsing on her own. Ralph joins her. Reciting their lines in the play, they end up confessing their love. Philip, Ross, Collins, Campbell and Ralph discuss Liz Morden one more time. Collins is afraid of a miscarriage of justice, as the evidence against her is flimsy. Liz is given a last chance to defend herself. She finally speaks, saying that she knew Cable wanted to steal the food, but she wasn‚Äôt present when he did. Collins orders a retrial. Despite her situation, Liz surprises everyone present by politely promising to perform her role in the play. Backstage before the performance, the actors attempt to console Duckling. They also discuss the future: Dabby plans to escape that night; Sideway wants to start a theatre company; Liz and Freeman want to join Sideway's company as actors and Wisehammer as playwright; Mary and Ralph plan their lives together. Caesar is very drunk and suffering from stage fright; only ludicrous threats from his fellow actors convince him to go on stage. Wisehammer reminds Ralph of the prologue he wrote for the play and reads it. Although pleased, Ralph does not dare to use it, because it is too political. The play begins: Arscott and Caesar go onstage while as the rest of the cast listens in trepidation. The first speech of the play is met with tremendous applause. == Characters  Use of doubling === The play has been written with the idea of doubling in mind, needing only 10 actors for 22 roles. It is typically performed with performers changing costumes on stage; a wig and military uniform jacket marking the only differences between an officer and a convict. Ralph Clark is the only character that has to be played by an actor without a second role; every other actor plays at least one convict and one officer, with three actors even taking three roles. The following table shows the list of characters with all roles typically (as done by the original production and imitated by most later productions) taken by one actor in the same horizontal line. === Overview of characters === * Captain Arthur Phillip, RN: The real Arthur Phillip had been called out of retirement to take on the position of Governor of the first fleet to Australia. He is a calm and controlled leader, contrasting Major Robbie Ross's leadership. He shows an obvious patience and understanding towards the convicts, especially Liz Morden. Throughout the play he refers to historical people and situations, such as famous thespians Garrick and Kemble. He is intellectual, understanding, and authoritative. * Major Robbie Ross, RM: The real Major Robbie Ross had previously been on the losing side of the American War of Independence. In the play, Ross makes a reference to this, \\"This is a profligate prison for us all, it's a hellish hole we soldiers have been hauled to because they blame us for losing the war in America.\\" (Act Two, Scene Ten) The fact he feels he is being blamed may account for some of his bitterness. He is a vile, power obsessed man, who intimidates the convicts and believes that the convicts' punishment should be severe. He is completely against the play The Recruiting Officer being put on, and constantly ridicules Ralph Clark for it. * Captain David Collins, RM: Collins was appointed as the colony's judge on arrival at Botany Bay in 1788 and as such, his contribution to conversations at hand are generally from a legal perspective. He approaches subjects with the other officers very logically and justifies all of his comments. He fully supports Ralph's decision to stage a play and conducts a vote amongst the officers to find out who agrees with them. The real David Collins went on to found the first settlement in Tasmania. * Captain Watkin Tench, RM: Tench is an officer who dislikes all of the convicts for the simple fact that they are convicts. Whenever he has a comment to make about them, it is always a sarcastic aside. He does not believe in the redemption of the convicts, nor in the fact that they can be converted from their criminal ways. He regards all of the convicts as barbarians, stating that hanging is \\"their favourite form of entertainment\\" (Act One, Scene Three). * Captain Jemmy Campbell, RM: A follower of Ross. There is great debate among productions as to his sobriety and while he is often played as drunk, there is nothing ever mentioned in the script to confirm this thought. He tends to copy Ross's views on everything though finds himself amused by the idea of the convicts performing a play. * Reverend Richard Johnson: The first clergyman in the Australian Penal Colony at Port Jackson, Johnson was to be a moral guide to both the convicts and officers of the camp, but seems more concerned with the play propagating Christian doctrine than any more pressing matters at hand. The Real Reverend Johnson was given a patch of land on which he planted oranges and lemons from Rio de Janeiro. It is said that he sold his 'Farm' for a fair profit when he left the colony. * Lieutenant William Dawes, RM: The colony's astronomer, who couldn't care less about matters on earth. He agrees to the play if he doesn't have to come and watch it. * Lieutenant George Johnston, RM: An officer most famed for his \\"compassion, if not to say passion\\" (Act One, Scene Six) for the convict women. The real Johnston lived with a convict named Esther Abrahams and later took part in the Rum Rebellion. * Second Lieutenant Ralph Clark: Ralph is struggling as a lower officer. He desperately wants promotion, and when he hears through Harry Brewer that Arthur Phillip has suggested a play be put on by the convicts, he jumps to set about doing it. You see his transformation in the play as he turns from a man who is extremely nervous and uneasy around women, even ridiculed for not having a woman convict for himself on the voyage to Australia, to a man in love with the convict Mary Brenham. He is influenced, to changing his feelings towards the convicts, by Arthur Phillip, giving them respect in the end, apologising to Liz Morden for interrupting her line in a rehearsal. The real Ralph Clark later had a daughter with Mary Brenham, whom he named Betsey Alicia ‚Äì for his wife in England. * Second Lieutenant William Faddy: He opposes the play simply because he doesn't like Ralph. His dislike is never really explained, but all of his comments in his only scene (Act One, Scene Six) are sarcastic snides or even insults directed at Ralph. * Midshipman Harry Brewer: Harry Brewer is an officer alongside the other army men, but is the lowest of ranks, Midshipman Harry Brewer struggles to find his place. Tormented by the apparent ghost of Handy Baker, a man who he had hanged, and other ghosts, he seeks reassurance in Ralph. Since in Australia, he and convict Duckling Smith have been together. He is a very jealous man, and is always keeping a watchful eye on Duckling, much to her dismay. He dies, with Duckling at his side in despair. * John Arscott: John Arscott's hopelessness as a convict becomes apparent in Act Two, Scene One. He says, 'There's no escape I tell you.' His utter hopelessness becomes more apparent when it is revealed that his compass he bought from a sailor is actually a piece of paper with 'North' written on it. Depending upon the delivery, this line can be full of humour or full of pathos. He eventually becomes most lost in the play, claiming that he doesn't have to think about reality when he plays Kite, finding a different way of \\"escape\\" through the theatre. The real John Arscott never actually tried escaping and got rich enough after his liberation to return to England. * James \\"Ketch\\" Freeman: Transported to Australia for the killing of a sailor who broke a strike, Freeman is made the hangman of the colony when he is told 'hang or be hanged'. Despised by many of the other convicts for being a hangman, in particular Liz Morden, Ketch struggles to be accepted. He exchanges words with Ralph in Act One, Scene Nine. He explains how he came to be in his situation, blaming a mix of reasons including leaving Ireland where his guardian angel was. You see also in this scene his desperation to be an actor in the play. * John Wisehammer: Transported to Australia for stealing snuff, he continues to claim his innocence. He is Jewish and struggles against slight (Liz) and strong (Ross) anti-semitism. His large knowledge is self-taught and he says of himself that he \\"like[s] words\\" (Act One, Scene Ten). He writes a new prologue to the play, which Ralph doesn't want to use on the first night, as he considers it too political. In the end, Wisehammer wants to stay in Australia, as \\"no one has more of a right than anyone else to call [him] a foreigner\\" (Act Two, Scene Eleven), and to become an author there. He and Mary Brenham exchange words, literally, in Act One, Scene Ten, where Wisehammer's slight intellectualism is explained. The real Wisehammer would get married and become a merchant after his release. * Black Caesar: Originally from Madagascar, Caesar wants to join the play and gets the (silent) parts of Worthy's servant and Kite's drummer more or less written for him. Stage fright gets the better of him in the end and he is only made to perform after the most ludicrous threats from his fellow actors. The real John Caesar was described as one of the most troublesome convicts and would be one of the colony's first bushrangers before being killed in 1796. * Robert Sideway: A London pickpocket, severely punished on the transport ship for insulting an officer, Sideway tries to act as a cultured gentleman in front of Ralph, but keeps falling into cant when upset. He claims to have seen many theatre pieces, but his acting is completely over the top and one of the major sources of humour in the first rehearsal scene, when he accompanies near every word with a gesture. He says that he wants to found a theatre company in the last scene, which, according to the epilogue in Thomas Keneally's novel, the historical Sideway actually did. * Mary Brenham (Branham): A very shy girl, whose love for \\"A.H.\\" turned her into a thief, she gets as good as dragged to the audition by Dabby Bryant, but is offered a part by Ralph after having heard her read only a few lines. She opens up gradually, but remains slightly naive in comparison to the people around her. She finally falls in love with Ralph and dreams of a future with him. Brenham and Clark would indeed have a daughter, but Clark would leave both of them behind upon returning to England. * Dabby Bryant: Mary's friend who constantly dreams of returning to Devon. Although she did sell Mary for food on the ship, she obviously cares for her. Although she seems to enjoy the play, she thinks the content and especially her character, Rose, are stupid and argues for a play that is more relevant towards their current situation. In the final scene, she reveals that she has plans for escaping that night. The real Mary Bryant would indeed become famous for a daring escape in 1791. * Duckling Smith: A young thief and prostitute, sentenced to death at only 18 years of age. Harry Brewer is hopelessly in love with her, a feeling that for a long time does not appear to be mutual. She only admits to loving Harry once he is close to dying and later says that she never told him about her love as she feared he might become cruel towards her. Keneally lists her real name as Ann, but none of the three women named \\"Ann Smith\\" on the First Fleet fit her description. * Liz Morden: One of the most troublesome women, Governor Phillip wants to make an example out of her: through redemption, which is why he wants her in the play. Liz is accused of stealing food, but does not defend herself at her trial. The play makes her care enough about herself to defend herself when given the last chance in Act Two, Scene Ten, where she claims that before, speaking wouldn't have mattered. In Keneally's novel, her name is Nancy Turner. Neither name can be found on the list of First Fleet convicts. * Meg Long: Nicknamed \\"Shitty Meg\\", she acts as a madam for the other women convicts. She has a short but humorous appearance in the audition, where she completely misunderstands Clark's call for women. * An Aboriginal Australian: He describes the British settler's efforts with curiosity and later with fear. Depending on how prominent his appearances are made in a given staging, the subject of colonisation may become more and more central to the play. == Educational use == In England, the play is used by the exam board AQA and Edexcel as a set text for Advanced Level Theatre Studies and as a set text to use in comparison essays for GCE. It has also been used in universities' performing arts and English departments. It has been performed across Europe as part of GCE candidates' final performances. It is also used at AS level in English Literature studies, as well as a set text in the OIB administered by CIE and is also commonly used in English speaking English Literature classes for the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme. == Productions == The play's first production was at the Royal Court Theatre, London, on 10 September 1988, directed by Max Stafford-Clark. The production starred David Haig as Ralph Clark, Jim Broadbent as Harry Brewer, John Arscott and Captain Campbell, Linda Bassett as Lieutenant Will Dawes and Liz Morden, and Ron Cook as Captain Arthur Phillip and John Wisehammer.Shane, Emma.

It was led by Prime Minister Sergey Kiriyenko, appointed acting Prime Minister on March 23 and proposed to the State Duma for approvement on March 27, 1998. On April 10 and April 17 Duma disapproved him as Prime Minister twice (April 10: 143 in favor, 186 against, 5 abstained, April 17: 115 in favor, 271 against, 11 abstained), but on the third time on April 24 he was approved by the State Duma (251 in favor, 25 against) and appointed Prime Minister by the President. According to the Constitution of Russia, if the State Duma rejects the President's nomination three times, it must be dissolved and a parliamentary election held. According to the Russian legislation, the ministers were appointed by the President. On August 23, 1998 Yeltsin sacked the government after the 1998 Russian financial crisis had taken a dramatic turn on August 17, replaced Kiriyenko with Viktor Chernomyrdin as acting Prime Minister, although he had been neither a deputy nor even a member of the cabinet of Kiriyenko as required by law, and reappointed all the other ministers as acting ministers.

The chapters may be summarized as follows: :1: On parchment and other writing-material; language, and translation of the Jewish Scriptures; the Septuagint; persons who are qualified to prepare books; leaves and pages; open and closed paragraphs. :2: Spaces between letters, words, lines, pages, and books; space-lines; number of columns to the leaf, and lines to the column; width and height of the scrolls; rollers; sewing; mending; final letters. :3: Writing several books on a single scroll; verse- marks in the scroll of the Law; superscriptions; palimpsests; procedure in regard to incorrectly written scrolls; rolling and unrolling; manner of rolling and reading; respectful handling of the scroll of the Law; careful use of food as a gift of God. :4: The names of God and the interdiction against erasing them; Masoretic enumeration of such names; the sinfulness of profanely using any of them. :5: Sacrosanct writing of the names of God; scribal errors in such and in the lines of the sacred scroll; the Divine Name on vessels and utensils; preservation of scrolls and other writings which have become useless; use of loaned writings. :6: Points written in the Torah; textual variations in the ancient scrolls used in the Temple at Jerusalem; Masoretic textual and orthographical variants. :7: Masoretic combination of the Qere and Ketiv. :8: Textual variants in Psalms 18 and II Samuel 22, and in Isaiah 36-39 and II Kings 18-20 :9: Capital letters in the Torah; written words for which others must be substituted in reading; passages which are neither read nor translated. :10: General laws of Torah reading; number of readers; number of persons requisite for public religious functions; kaddish and barekhu. :11: Order of Torah reading and of the translations to be read; errors in Torah reading :12: Method of reading the curses, the songs, and the Ten Commandments; the Torah reading on the Rosh Hodesh of Hanukkah; mode of writing the songs in Exodus 15, Judges 5, and Deuteronomy 32, as well as the order of reading Deuteronomy 32. :13: Method of writing the Hagiographa in general and the scroll of Esther in particular; blessings in connection with the Maf·π≠ir and the reading of the Torah. :14: Blessing on reading the Hagiographa in general and the scroll of Esther in particular; liturgical observances prefatory to the reading; persons authorized to read and to officiate as ·∏•azzanim; individuals qualified to read the scroll of Esther; reading the other smaller scrolls; sanctity of the scroll of the Law; phylacteries and mezuzot. :15: Sanctity of other religious writings; diversity of the rabbinical sciences; occupations to be taught to children. :16: Value of the study of the Torah; the aggadah; manifold interpretations; scholarship of the ancient teachers; sections of the Pentateuch; chapters of the Psalms; the Kedushah prayer. :17: General laws on the sections prescribed for the festivals; assistants at the sacrifice and their prayers; lessons and psalms for Rosh Hodesh. :18: Daily and festival psalms; order of prayer for the anniversary of the destruction of Jerusalem; observances for the Yom Kippur. :19: Further regulations regarding the psalms for festivals; formulas of prayer for the festivals; eulogy on announcing the new moon; benedictions for weddings and funerals. :20: Kiddush levana; lighting the Hanukkah candles; blessings and Torah reading for Hanukkah; the Kedushah prayer on holidays; \\"Hallel.\\" :21: Nisan, the month of rejoicing; Purim and its observances; the blessings of the Torah and the Megillah at Purim; Haggadah of the Jewish Patriarchs.M√ºller, Masseket Soferim, etc., pp. 37 et seq. == Divisions == Soferim may be divided into three main divisions: chapters 1‚Äì5, 6‚Äì9, and 10‚Äì21, the last of which is subdivided into two sections, 10-15 and 16:2-21. The tractate derives its name from its first main division (chapters 1-5), which treats of writing scrolls of the Law, thus conforming to the ancient custom of naming a work according to its initial contents.Compare Blau, Zur Einleitung in die Heilige Schrift, pp. 31 et seq., Strasburg, 1894 According to Zunz, \\"the little work is now badly disarranged, as is shown by the confusion of the two principal themes [i.e., the preparation of scrolls, and the rituals of Torah reading and prayers], and the position and character of the aggadah.\\"G. V. 2d ed., p. 100, notes a,b; he provides the following elaboration: \\"Rules for writing and for the Masorah are found in 1 (1-6,9-14); 2; 3 (1-9, 10a, 11, 12, 13 [in part], 14-16); 4-8; 9 (1-7); 12 (8b, 9-12); 13 (1-4, 6a, 7); 15 (1-5); 17 (1); synagogual ritual in 9 (8-11); 10; 11; 12 (1-7, 8a); 13 (5, 8-14); 14; 15 (12,end); 17 (2-11); 18-20; 21 (1-8); aggadah in 1 (7-8); 3 (10b, 13 [in part]); 13 (6b, 10); 16 (1-11, 12a); 21 9\\" Zunz likewise shows the relationship existing between this work and later aggadot. This lack of system, however, is not the result of careless copying or other negligence, but is due to the nature of the tractate's redaction; for it is a composite of at least three works, and the systematic order of the earlier part has evidently been disarranged by interpolations. In its present form the tractate is intended more for Torah readers and hazzanim than for scribes: it is in great part confined to ritual laws, although it must be borne in mind that the same person doubtless combined the functions of scribe and reader. ===First part=== This first part is the earliest component of the work, and is extant also as an independent \\"minor tractate,\\" entitled Massekhet Sefer Torah;Edited by Raphael Kirchheim 1851 in this form it is a systematic work, but as incorporated in Soferim, although its division into chapters and paragraphs has been retained, its order has been disarranged by interpolations. A comparison of the two texts shows in an instructive way how ancient Jewish works developed in the course of time. The minor tractate Sefarim, edited by Sch√∂nblum, is not earlier (as he assumes) but rather later than Masseket Sefer Torah, from which it is an extract. The name \\"Sefarim\\" (= \\"books\\") is merely the plural of \\"sefer,\\" designating the Torah as \\"the book\\" par excellence. ===Second part=== Chapters 6 to 9 constitute a separate part, containing Masoretic rules for writing; the first four paragraphs of chapter 6 and some passages of chapter 9 are of early date. This portion was undoubtedly added by Masoretes of Tiberias; and the main portion of the modern Masorah, which also contains the passages in question, likewise originated in the same school. The first two parts of Soferim are acknowledged to be Judean, and were intended for the scribes; the last three halakhot are a kind of appendix relating to the reading of certain words and passages. ===Third part=== The third division is chiefly devoted to rules concerning the order of Torah reading, together with liturgical laws. It is not a uniform composition, although the first section (chapters 10-15) is concerned almost entirely with the sequence of Torah readings, while the remaining part (chapters 16-21) contains liturgical laws. The contents of 16:1 apparently form the conclusion of the portion of the work which precedes it. The third part of Soferim is likewise Judean in origin, as is shown by its sources; nor is this view contradicted by the phrases \\"our teachers in the West\\" (◊®◊ë◊ï◊™◊ô◊†◊ï ◊©◊ë◊û◊¢◊®◊ë, 10:8) and \\"the people of the East and the people of the West\\" (◊ë◊†◊ô ◊û◊ñ◊®◊ó ◊ï◊ë◊†◊ô ◊û◊¢◊®◊ë at 10,end; 13:10), since either a Palestinian or a Babylonian might have used such expressions, although these passages may be interpolations. The second section of the last portion (16:2-21) was added latest of all. It contains passages from the Babylonian Talmud, mentioning the \\"teachers of the land of Israel\\" (no longer ◊û◊¢◊®◊ë, as in 21:1) in 17:4, and speaking of the Nazarenes (◊†◊ï◊¶◊®◊ô◊ù = Christians) in 17:6, while a passage from Pirkei De-Rabbi EliezerPirkei De-Rabbi Eliezer 17,end is cited on the authority of R. Eliezer b. Hyrcanus (19:12). These peculiarities indicate that its date is relatively late, even though these last passages are in the main also Judean in origin, as is shown by the use of the name \\"Nazarene.\\" ==Place of composition== Many details of the text indicate detailed knowledge of the Jerusalem Talmud and the custom of the Land of Israel, and thus point to an origin there (rather than in Babylonia): * The customs of Jerusalem are also mentioned (18:5, 21:6) in a way which indicates an acquaintance with them and points to an author who may have been from Tiberias, but was not from Jerusalem. The names of the school, teachers, and countries also confirm this view. * Hai Gaon knew nothing of the liturgical observance mentioned in 19:11M√ºller, l.c. p. 277, note 67 * The controversy regarding the mode of reading (21:7) is taken from the Jerusalem Talmud,Taanit 4:3, end, and Megillah 4:2 not from the parallel passage in the Babylonian Talmud.Megillah 22a, where Rav and Samuel of Nehardea discuss the same question. The long passage which follows is a direct quotation from the Jerusalem Talmud. * The Babylonian amora Rav Yosef is designated as \\"Rabbi,\\" and not as \\"Rav\\" (13:7) * The assumption that there are weekly sections which do not contain 21 verses (11:4) applies only to the triennial cycle of the Land of Israel * Soferim 13:3-5 parallels the Jerusalem Talmud, Megillah 3:7 (74b). The hypothesis that Soferim is based on Palestinian sources agrees with the ancient tradition (Nahmanides and others) that all the small tractates are Palestinian in origin;Orient, 1851, p. 218 and modern scholars, except for I.H. Weiss, also accept this view.J.L. Rapoport, in Kerem ·∏§emed, vi. 247; Zunz, G. V. 2d ed., p. 322; Steinschneider, J√ºdische Literatur, pp. 369 et seq., and Henry Malter's Hebrew translation, Sifrut Yisrael, p. 44, Warsaw, 1897; Kirchheim, preface to his edition of Masseket Soferim; Br√ºll's Jahrb. i. 4 There were scholars in Palestine even after the final redaction of Jerusalem Talmud,Zunz, l.c. p. 322, note a and the Bible was still the chief subject of study. == Date of composition == The evidence of all these facts makes it very probable that this tractate was finally redacted about the middle of the 8th century, an assumption which is supported by the statement of Rabbeinu Asherc. 1300, in Hilkhot Sefer Torah that Soferim was composed at a late date. At that period written prayer-books were doubtless in existence and were probably produced by the scribes, who combined the offices of communal chazzan and reader. It was natural, therefore, that in tractates intended for the scribes all the regulations should be collected which concerned books, the Masorah, and the liturgy. It is practically certain that few copies of the Talmud were made at that time, and those without special rules; consequently no allusions to them are found in Soferim. The fact that no sources are given for a number of the regulations in the first part points to an early date of composition.Compare 1:3,13; 2:4,6,8; 3:4,6-9a,10-12a; 4:4,5,8,9; 5:1,2; in 1:7, also, M√ºller cites no authority; compare, however, Shabbat 115a and Megillah 18a, and see Blau, l.c. pp. 70 et seq. Similarly, in the third part (chapters 10-21), which is later, no sources are assigned for a number of halakhot;15:3 may, however, be based on Yerushalmi Shabbat 15c, 25 so that care must be taken not to assign the compilation of this longest portion to too recent a date. Both the form and the content of those passages in which authorities are not mentioned point to a Judean origin; they may have been derived from the lost portions of Yerushalmi and various midrashic works, which, indeed, they may be regarded as in part replacing. Only certain interpolations, as well as the aggadic passage at the end of the tractate (or, in several manuscripts, at its beginning), may have been added much later. The division of the last part into sections (\\"perakim\\") seems to have been intended to secure a uniform size for the several sections; for 16:1 belongs to the end of chapter 15, and 19:1 to the end of 18, their separation being due to external reasons. == Notable laws == As the substance of the tractate has been incorporated in later works on orthography, the Masorah, and the liturgy, only a few points peculiar to it need be mentioned here. In 1:13 occurs the maxim \\"He who cannot read is not allowed to write.\\" Custodians seem to be mentioned in 2:12.Based on Yerushalmi Megillah 1:9; compare Machzor Vitry, p. 689, note The first notice in Jewish literature of the codex in contradistinction to the scroll occurs in 3:6,Compare Machzor Vitry p. 691 a passage which is to be translated as follows: \\"Only in a codex [may the Torah, the Prophets, and the Writings be combined]; in a scroll the Torah and the Prophets must be kept separate\\"; while the following section describes a scroll of the Law as being divided into verses (doubtless by means of blank spaces), or as having the initial portion of its verses pointed. Among the ancients the beginning (\\"resh pasuk\\") of a verse rather than the end (\\"sof pasuk\\") was emphasized, since the former was important mnemonically. There were scribes, therefore, who marked the initial of the verse, although there is no trace of such points in the present Masorah and system of accentuation. The earliest passage referring to \\"dyed leather\\" (parchment) is 3:13, although it is possible, in view of 2:10, that originally ◊ë◊¢◊ï◊®◊ï◊™ ◊¶◊ë◊ê◊ô◊ù (with deer leather) stood in place of ◊ë◊¢◊ï◊®◊ï◊™ ◊¶◊ë◊ï◊¢◊ô◊ù (with dyed leather). Even if that be true, however, this is still the first reference to colored parchment for synagogal scrolls; for nothing else could be implied by these words in the received reading. The skin of game was a favorite writing-material; so that while it was forbidden to use half leather and half parchment, half leather and half skin of game were allowable.2:10 It was forbidden, moreover, to cut the edges of books (5:14). A scribal term which does not occur elsewhere is found in 5:1,2 (◊û◊¢◊õ◊ë, variant reading ◊û◊ó◊ò◊ë). There were generally 72 lines to the column in a scroll of the Law (12:1). The passage 13:1 refers to the stichic writing of the Psalms; Book of Job, and Proverbs; and the remark \\"A good scribe will note\\" shows that the passage was written at a time when this detail was no longer generally observed.Compare M√ºller, ad loc., and Machzor Vitry, p. 704 Soferim is the first work to distinguish between the three grades of inspiration in the Bible: Torah, Neviim (\\"divrei kabbala\\"), and Ketuvim (\\"divrei kedushah\\").Soferim 18:3,end == Halakhic authority == Because Soferim belongs to the Minor Tractates, and is not part of the Babylonian Talmud nor the Jerusalem Talmud, later generations of Jews have not always accepted its rulings (in whole or in part) as authoritative. There are a few points of halakha which rabbis have decided straight from Soferim, since they are not mentioned in the Talmud. For example, many Rishonim and the Vilna Gaon rule that a berakha must be recited before the reading of the megilloth Song of Songs, Ruth, Lamentations, and Ecclesiastes; this berakha is mentioned in Soferim, though not in the Talmud. Similarly, Rabbi S. S. Boyarski ruled that a berakha must be recited before reading the other books of Kethuvim; this berakha, too (different in text from the one for the megilloth) is mentioned only in Soferim, and not in the Talmud. However, these rulings have not been accepted by all groups of Jews. == References == It has the following bibliography: *Vitry Ma·∏•zor, ed.

While a regent, he was a strong proponent of the admission of women to the University of Michigan. He introduced an unsuccessful motion to that effect in 1869, but was successful on January 5, 1870, when the Board passed his resolution stating that \\"the board of regents recognize the right of every resident of Michigan to the enjoyment of the privileges afforded by the university, and that no rule exists in any of the university statutes for the exclusion of any person from the university who possesses the requisite literary and moral qualifications.\\" Willard was a member of the Michigan State House of Representatives in 1866 and 1867. He was a member of the State constitutional convention in 1867 and a delegate to the Republican National Convention in 1872. He was elected as a Republican from Michigan's 3rd congressional district to the 43rd and 44th United States Congresses, serving from March 4, 1873 to March 3, 1877. He was not a candidate for re-nomination in 1876. George Willard resumed newspaper work in Battle Creek, serving as editor and owner of the Battle Creek Journal until his death. He was interred in Oak Hill Cemetery. == Notes == == References == * ==External links== *The Political Graveyard Category:1824 births Category:1901 deaths Category:Members of the United States House of Representatives from Michigan Category:Members of the Michigan House of Representatives Category:Regents of the University of Michigan Category:Michigan Republicans Category:Republican Party members of the United States House of Representatives Category:19th-century American politicians ","title":"George Willard"},{"id":"9110236","text":"Susan B.

Originally planned as a broad gauge (7 ft 0¬º in, 2,140 mm) feeder to the Bristol & Exeter Railway, it became part of a battle between the broad gauge group and the standard gauge railway interests. In this context, standard gauge lines were often described as narrow gauge. The original construction in the middle of the nineteenth century was significant in giving rail connection to the important, but remote towns of North Devon that had hitherto relied on the packhorse and coastal shipping. The Exeter to Barnstaple section followed the rivers Yeo and Taw, passing through pleasing countryside, and meandered with the valleys, but passing only very small settlements. It remains open between Exeter and Barnstaple, and passenger trains on the route are branded the Tarka Line for marketing purposes. The northern extremities turned south to Bideford and Torrington following the coast of the Bristol Channel before turning inland. Part of this section is now a cycleway known as the Tarka Trail. ==Plans and debatesParliamentary battles=== In the 1830s, it began to be apparent that railways could substantially improve the prospects of connected towns. Most existing transport was by coastal shipping, by rivers and canals, or by pack horse. In 1831 promoters in Crediton decided that rail connection to a dock on the tidal River Exe at Exeter was needed, and Parliamentary powers were obtained by Act of 23 June 1832. However no construction actually took place and the powers lapsed. A public meeting at Barnstaple came to a corresponding conclusion for their town, and proposed a railway to Fremington, and to construct a dock there, avoiding the difficult passage of the River Taw to their town. They obtained the Taw Vale Railway and Dock Act on 11 June 1838, but this scheme too resulted in no actual construction. However, there was enough interest to get the Taw Vale Amendment Act on 21 July 1845 extending the powers and authorising certain additional works. The Bristol and Exeter Railway (B&ER;) reached Exeter, opening on 1 May 1844, putting the city directly in rail communication with London. At this time it was realised everywhere that railways were needed to connect with the beginnings of a national network. High dividend distributions among the earlier companies provoked a vast number of railway schemes, at a time when it was believed that any district could only support a single railway, and the frenzy this created is known as the railway mania. At the same time, the Great Western Railway (GWR) and its ally the B&ER; were built using the broad gauge, while nearly all large competing companies used the standard gauge (often referred to as the narrow gauge in contrast). If a new independent local scheme was being promoted, securing its chosen gauge to be broad or narrow also secured its allegiance to one or the other of the larger companies, and in turn this might secure further territorial exclusivity for the winner. This continuing process became known as the gauge wars. In 1845 the railway mania resulted in a huge number of competing schemes being proposed in Parliament, which arranged for a Railway Commission led by Lord Dalhousie to review competing proposals and recommend a selected scheme for each area. The commission was informally referred to at the time as the Five Kings. In addition, because of difficulties in operating a national network with railways using different gauges, a Gauge Commission was set up to propose policy on the gauge question. Schemes put forward for the consideration of Dalhousie's included a new Exeter and Crediton Railway (to join Crediton to the B&ER; at Exeter) and a North Devon Railway to run from Crediton to Barnstaple. The Commission rejected all other proposals for the area, and in a report dated 4 March 1845 they recommended postponement of a decision on these two in order to appraise an alternative route suggestion, to run from Tiverton to Barnstaple instead of Exeter to Barnstaple. The Taw Vale Dock and Railway from Barnstaple to Fremington was of course already authorised. Crediton had observed the arrival of the B&ER; at Exeter and developed a scheme to run from their town to join the B&ER; at Cowley Bridge. Surprisingly in view of Dalhousie's recommendation, they got their Act of Parliament on 21 July 1845, with authorised capital of ¬£70,000. The track gauge was not specified. The new Company intended to lease their line to the B&ER.; ===The plans take shape=== With the Taw Vale line (from Barnstaple to Fremington) and the Exeter and Crediton line authorised, thoughts turned more urgently to connecting Barnstaple to the emerging national network; two projected lines sought to do this in the 1846 session of Parliament, and they polarised in their obvious allegiance to other lines. A North Devon Railway Company was promoted to build a broad gauge line from Tiverton, where the B&ER; was building a branch line, via Bampton and Dulverton to Barnstaple and Bideford. Several directors of the B&ER; and Great Western Railway were on the provisional committee, together with the Lord Lieutenant of Devonshire and other worthies; and the scheme became inflated with lines to Taunton and Plymouth, and the estimated cost rose to ¬£1.75 million. Isambard Kingdom Brunel was the engineer. However the deposited plans were submitted to Parliament late, and the Bill was rejected as not complying with Standing Orders; no more was heard of this North Devon Railway and ¬£38,668 had been expended on surveys and designs fruitlessly. The second was the Taw Vale Railway Extension and Dock Company. The capital was to be ¬£700,000, to build from Barnstaple to Crediton; in effect the route of the 1845 North Devon Railway that had been postponed by decision of Dalhousie's committee. The difference from the previous scheme was that the London and South Western Railway (LSWR) was heavily supporting the proposed line, seeing the chance to capture a large area of territory. The engineer was Joseph Locke, the engineer of the LSWR. This was evidently a long-term aim, for at this time the LSWR Was still building its Salisbury branch, 90 miles away. The TVER was to take over the Taw Vale Railway works, and to have new capital of ¬£533,000, and it got its authorising Act of Parliament on 7 August 1846. The new Company was usually referred to as the Taw Vale Extension Railway, (TVER), or simply the Taw Vale Railway. The following session saw the TVER get an authorising Act (on 22 July 1847) for branches to Bideford and South Molton. ===The B&ER; loses influence=== When the broad gauge interest lost their proposed North Devon Railway, they lost no time in negotiating with the TVER promoters, and provisionally agreed a lease of the line to the B&ER; there was already a corresponding provisional agreement for the B&ER; to lease the Exeter and Crediton line. These provisional leases had to be ratified by shareholders, and the allegiance to the B&ER; and the broad gauge, or to the LSWR and the narrow gauge, was a contentious issue. It was known that many E&CR; shares had been bought up by persons favourable to the LSWR and at the E&CR; shareholders' meeting on 11 January 1847 the provisional lease was rejected. A week later the provisional TVER lease had to be put to its shareholders' meeting for ratification, and it was rejected unanimously. A more favourable lease to the LSWR was negotiated and ratified by shareholders on 18 January 1847. The Exeter and Crediton line needed to lease its line, and the shareholders now ratified a lease to the TVER on 24 February 1847. This was to be guaranteed by the LSWR and was in effect a lease to them. J W Buller was chairman of the E&CR; board and he and other directors aligned to the B&ER; were in the majority; but it was very plain that the huge majority of shareholders favoured the LSWR. To frustrate further alignment to the narrow gauge, Buller signed a two-year contract with a George Hennett to work the line on 7 April 1847. The minority Taw Vale directors called an Extraordinary General Meeting on 12 April 1847, and proposed removal of Buller and three other B&ER; directors, and proposed prohibiting the opening of the line on the broad gauge. Buller as Chairman declared the proposition to be illegal but it was carried. Amid angry scenes and a scuffle, Buller and his friends departed the meeting, taking the minute book with them. At subsequent legal hearings, the takeover by the Taw Vale directors was declared to be legal, and a director called Thorne was properly the chairman of the company. Complaints were made to the Railway Commissioners, and they found that the LSWR had improperly funded share purchases by local individuals to gain a majority at the votes, but the B&ER; had done a similar thing over the E&CR; vote. ==Construction startsTaw Vale and Exeter & Crediton construction=== While all this had been going on, some actual construction had also been worked on. The Taw Vale had started construction on 5 January 1846, and the Exeter and Crediton had started work at the end of 1845. In fact at the shareholders' meeting of 24 February 1847 referred to above, Buller had reported that the line was complete and ready, excepting the connection to the B&ER; at Cowley Bridge, near Exeter, which could not be made until some formal agreement with the B&ER; had been made. By March 1847 the original Taw Vale line from Barnstaple to Fremington was substantially complete, and the first sod of the extension was dug, and contracts for it let. However the financial collapse following the railway mania led to scarcity of money, and in November work on the Extension had to be suspended. ===The gauge question comes to a head=== The authorising Act for the Taw Vale Extension had left the crucial question of the gauge of the new line to be determined by the Board of Trade. The TVER now on 27 August 1847 asked for approval for laying standard gauge track. Following the rejection of the E&CR; lease to the B&ER;, the directors of the E&CR; now saw themselves as aligned to the LSWR. The railway had been fully completed, except for the connection to the B&ER; at Cowley Bridge. Believing that this connection was now impossible, on 3 December 1847 the Board ordered the broad gauge track to be converted to narrow gauge. Reaching Exeter over the B&ER; would be impossible, so they started work on a station at Cowley Bridge near the turnpike road: Cowley Bridge was to be their railhead for Exeter. This arrangement would be hugely inconvenient, for traffic from Barnstaple and North Devon, as well as Crediton. The Railway Commissioners of the Board of Trade now on 8 February 1848 gave their decision on the gauge of the TVER: it was to be on the broad gauge, because of the dominance of the broad gauge on the main lines in the area: the B&ER; and the South Devon Railway, open from Exeter to Totnes, and building on to Plymouth. The decision only applied to the TVER: the section from Crediton to Barnstaple. The E&CR; and the original Taw Vale line to Bideford had been authorised without the requirement to get Board of Trade approval for their gauge. Four days later, on 12 February 1848 the E&CR; directors announced that they had changed the gauge of their line to \\"the national gauge\\". They had now exceeded their authorised capital and borrowings, so they obtained authority in an Act of 10 June 1850 to increase the capital by ¬£20,000 in what would nowadays be called a rights issue. Their Act also authorised enlargement of their Cowley Bridge station. Finally the LSWR had promoted, with its allies, a line from Salisbury to Exeter, which was approved, but on 28 June 1848 a link line from its independent Exeter station to reach Cowley Bridge was rejected. For the time being the E&CR;, and therefore all the North Devon lines, were isolated. ===Achievements to 1850=== With work on the TVER at a standstill for lack of cash, and the double track E&CR; line completed but not operating, there was little to show for all the frenzied activity, and huge expenditure, of the preceding years. In fact the sole tangible outcome was that the original Taw Vale line from Barnstaple to Fremington had opened on the narrow gauge in August 1848; it was operated by horse traction, for goods traffic only. His lease expired on 18 May 1850 and the Taw Vale board did not permit its allocation because of damage to the track by horses. ==OpeningsThe E&CR; opens=== For the time being, the broad gauge interest was the only network with the resources to assist the North Devon lines. The E&CR;, chaired by William Chapman, who was also the Chairman of the LSWR, obtained the shareholders' approval on 28 February 1851 for a lease of their line to the B&ER; the B&ER; would do everything necessary to work the line; and the lease would expire seven years after the opening of the Crediton to Fremington line. The E&CR; was to reinstate broad gauge on one line of the double track, and pay the B&ER; to install the essential junction at Cowley Bridge. This was quickly done, with the second narrow gauge line being left disconnected. Captain Mynne of the Board of Trade inspected the line and approved it, and a ceremonial opening took place on 12 May 1851. A passenger service of seven trains each way started immediately. The stations were St Cyres and Crediton; the Cowley Bridge station was not now required and was never opened. ===Opening from Crediton to Barnstaple=== The iron railway bridge over the River Taw south of Barnstaple in 1854The TVER had suspended work due to lack of cash, and it was now time for it too to reappraise the situation. 20% of the shares had been forfeited, but many landowners had been induced to accept shares for the purchase of necessary land; it was proposed to return to Parliament to reduce the capital of the company and to authorise numerous deviations, so that the line could be opened as a single broad gauge line. This was approved and the Act was obtained on 24 July 1851, and the company's name was changed to the North Devon Railway & Dock Company, generally referred to as the North Devon Railway (NDR). ¬£50,000 in new shareholdings was required and the directors exerted themselves considerably to canvass for this, finally being successful in December 1851. The first sod of the new construction was cut on 2 February 1851; Thomas Brassey was the contractor, and the line was to be leased to him, but hiring in rolling stock from the B&ER.; On 30 June 1854 Captain Tyler of the Board of Trade made his inspection of the Crediton to Barnstaple section; it was not proposed to open the Barnstaple to Fremington line until the continuation to Bideford was ready. (In fact the powers for this had not been renewed, and they lapsed.) He made some comments regarding signal positions and observed that the track was broad gauge on cross sleepers \\"with double I rails\\": flat bottom rails. It was single line broad gauge throughout, with the electric telegraph installed throughout the line. Opening ceremony of the North Devon Railway at BarnstapleA ceremonial opening from Crediton to Barnstaple took place on 12 July 1854, but due to Tyler's requirements, the full public opening was delayed until 1 August 1854. There were four trains each way on weekdays, and two on Sundays. The stations were: * Yeoford * Copplestone * Morchard Road * Lapford * Eggesford * South Molton Road * Portsmouth Arms * Umberleigh * Chapelton siding; became a passenger station 8 June 1857, and closed 19 April 1860. Reopened 1 March 1875. There have been several alternate spellings, including Chapeltown and Chappletown. * Barnstaple Brassey operated the line, at first using the B&ER; rolling stock contracted in by the NDR directors, but after 28 July 1855 he provided his own stock. Engines were changed at Crediton on through trains. ===Bideford Extension Railway=== As the North Devon Railway had allowed the powers for the Bideford line to lapse, that town now was at a disadvantage. Commercial interests in the town formed the Bideford Extension Railway themselves, getting powers on 4 August 1853; the line opened on the broad gauge on 2 November 1855, worked by the North Devon company. As a result, the Barnstaple to Fremington section of the original Taw Vale Railway now got its passenger service for the first time. The Bideford station was at East the Water, somewhat north of the town bridge and on the opposite side of the River Torridge from the town. ==Narrow gauge againThe LSWR reaches Exeter=== Yeoford station in 1969The LSWR had long had designs on securing territory in Devon and it had been extending westwards from Salisbury. On 18 July 1860 it reached Exeter with its main line from Yeovil, terminating at its own Exeter station, referred to as Queen Street, and much later renamed Exeter Central. That station was much more convenient for the city than the Bristol and Exeter company's St Davids station. Public services started the following day. Hostility between the LSWR and the broad gauge companies had subsided, so that it was possible to negotiate access for the LSWR to the North Devon lines, which lay the other side of the B&ER; main line. Agreement was reached, and ratified by Parliament in the London & South Western Railway (Exeter & North Devon) Act of 3 July 1860. This authorised the construction of a connecting line from Queen Street to St Davids; the laying of mixed gauge track on the B&ER; from there to Cowley Bridge Junction; the leasing by the LSWR of the E&CR;, NDR and Bideford Extension lines and to mix their track gauge. The B&ER; Was to retain powers to run goods trains to Crediton. The E&CR; shareholders ratified a seven-year lease to the LSWR, from 1 January 1862; narrow gauge trains ran to Crediton from 3 February 1862. The North Devon Railway and the Bideford Extension Railway extended their lease to Brassey until 31 July 1862; from the next day the LSWR took over the leases and ran trains from Bideford to Exeter. As the NDR and Bideford Extension were still broad gauge, the LSWR leased Brassey's rolling stock for a year. Col Yolland of the Board of Trade inspected the Queen Street to St Davids connection on 27 January 1862 and passed it. Being informed that the LSWR proposed to operate narrow gauge trains to Crediton from the 3 February he objected, on the basis that there had been no inspection for narrow gauge running. The LSWR started their narrow gauge service notwithstanding, but Yolland inspected the line on 19 February. He found it satisfactory, but commented adversely on the curve at Cowley Bridge, which had been sharpened considerably when the first viaduct over the River Exe there had been reconstructed. Copplestone station in 1969Yolland made a further inspection, this time of the North Devon and the Bideford Extension lines, following their conversion to mixed gauge. He reported on 26 February 1863 that the original standard of engineering had been poor, and the long period of inactivity had led to deterioration; and he commented adversely on the switching arrangements for transferring narrow gauge trains from one side of the broad gauge line to the other at station platforms. The LSWR attended to the specific items and gave assurances regarding general maintenance, and were able to run narrow gauge trains between Crediton and Bideford from 2 March 1863. Brassey's lease of the Exeter & Crediton expired in July 1862; the LSWR had taken over the Exeter & Crediton and laid mixed gauge on it. It ran narrow gauge passenger trains from Exeter Queen Street to Crediton, from 1 February 1862; remarkably also broad gauge through coaches operated from Bideford to Paddington and Bristol, on the broad gauge of course, operated west of Exeter by the LSWR as successor to Brassey. The Bristol & Exeter continued to run broad gauge goods trains to Crediton until 20 May 1892. ===Amalgamation of the Devon lines=== The North Devon Railway & Dock Company and the Bideford Extension Railway were now ready to be absorbed by the LSWR, and amalgamation took effect on 1 January 1865, authorised by Act of 25 July 1864. This meant that the LSWR was now supreme in North Devon, and could use the lines as a launching pad to push on to Plymouth and Cornwall; but the Exeter and Crediton Railway was left independent, although most of the shares were owned by the LSWR and B&ER; together. ==Onward from the North Devon RailwayOn to Plymouth=== Coleford Junction signal box in 1970Already on 17 July 1862 the Okehampton Railway, supported by the LSWR, had obtained Parliamentary authority for a standard gauge railway to Okehampton, leaving the North Devon line west of Yeoford, at Colebrook. The following year an Act of 13 July 1863 authorised extension to Lidford on the newly authorised Launceston and South Devon Railway, and this was followed up with an Act of 23 June 1864, altering the site of the junction to Yeoford station, changing the Okehampton company's name to the Devon & Cornwall Railway. The LSWR made arrangements to lease the line. It was opened to the public as far as North Tawton on 1 November 1865. On 17 May 1876 the line reached Lidford (old spelling) on the broad gauge Launceston line. Narrow gauge rails had been installed on the relevant portion of that line, and LSWR trains could now reach Plymouth and Devonport over the mixed gauge from Lidford. These trains used the Exeter and Crediton line, greatly improving its profitability from the toll charges. ===Torrington=== As part of the tactics of gaining control of parts of the West Country, the LSWR had given a parliamentary undertaking in 1865 to extend the line from Bideford to Torrington. It tried to evade this responsibility, calculating that the declining importance of the town of Great Torrington ‚Äì the \\"Great\\" was never acknowledged by railway usage ‚Äì did not justify the expense of the line, but it was forced to comply with its obligations. It opened to a new passenger station at Bideford, immediately east of the town bridge, on 10 June 1872; the original terminus was unsuitable for use on the extension, and became the town's goods station. Onward from Bideford to Torrington was opened on 18 July 1872. ===Ilfracombe=== Barnstaple Junction in 1960With the rise of seaside holidays, and with the LSWR wishing to encourage the development of resorts that catered to that, and which brought the fruits of seaside industries as well, an extension to Ilfracombe became obvious. The Barnstaple and Ilfracombe Railway was incorporated on 4 July 1870, supported by the LSWR, it opened its line on 20 July 1874, and as worked by the LSWR. It crossed the River Taw by a curved bridge there and provided a new Barnstaple Town station ‚Äì the original station was on the south side of Barnstaple Bridge, and was referred to as the Old Station, but became formally known as Barnstaple Junction. As first offered to the Board of Trade Inspector, Lt Col Hutchinson, the old station necessitated changing passengers to cross the line on the level; a footbridge was required and duly provided. ===Broad gauge from Taunton=== In 1873 a broad gauge railway reached Barnstaple; it was the Devon and Somerset Railway (D&SR;), which ran from a junction near Taunton to an independent, unconnected station at Barnstaple. Because of the attraction of Ilfracombe, road coaches conveyed passengers between the D&SR; station and the resort. The Great Western Railway (as successor to the Devon and Somerset Railway) contemplated building its own independent line from the Devon and Somerset station at Barnstaple onwards to Ilfracombe, but in fact it proved possible to come to an agreement with the LSWR for through running. Accordingly, the GWR obtained Parliamentary authority to build a connecting line at Barnstaple. At first this was to run direct from the approaching Taunton line, by-passing the existing GWR station, but at a late stage this was altered to run between the GWR station and the LSWR Junction station. Through trains from Taunton therefore required to reverse at the GWR station.Until 1905 when the direct spur was commissioned. The line opened on 1 June 1887, and through coaches to Ilfracombe started to run. At first the GWR insisted on the through coaches conveying passengers from GWR stations to Ilfracombe only, and not to other LSWR stations, but the restriction was later removed. ==Modernising== Umberleigh station in 1970The original North Devon line was signalled using disc and crossbar signals. With a considerable network in Devon now open or in course of completion, there were greatly increasing traffic volumes, and the LSWR decided to modernise the signalling. On 1 October 1873 most of the stations from Copplestone to Umberleigh were equipped with semaphore signals and block instruments using Preece's three wire system. Single track had become a serious limitation, and the LSWR took powers to double much of the line, including the Exeter and Crediton section and the junction approach at Cowley Bridge, and the provision there of a new signal box in addition to the B&ER; one. The portion to Crediton was still mixed gauge, so the doubling was mixed as well, and numerous bridge needed to be reconstructed. The loop at Cowley Bridge was opened on 11 November 1874, followed by the line from there to St Cyres on 23 February 1875. The short section from the Cowley Bridge loop to the B&E; junction was opened on 2 June 1875, and St Cyres to Crediton was opened as double track the same day. From Crediton to Yeoford was doubled on 1 June 1876. The LSWR was able to remove the obligation to maintain broad gauge tracks beyond Crediton; this had been used by a single daily broad gauge goods train for several years. The last broad gauge train beyond Crediton ran on 30 April 1877. Following this, the line from Yeoford to Coleford Junction (the point of divergence of the Lidford line) was doubled in standard gauge only on 16 May 1877. The LSWR continued the doubling towards Lidford, completing it on 22 December 1879. The Act of 13 July 1876 authorising the doubling by the LSWR of the Exeter and Crediton section had also permitted purchase of the line, and after some delay this was concluded on 26 June 1879. The valuation of the E&CR; was ¬£217,687 of which the LSWR already owned 60%. Great Western Railway goods trains continued to run to Crediton for the time being, but in 1892 the GWR converted all its remaining broad and mixed gauge track to standard gauge. During the period of intensive work, on 22 May 1892 the GWR ran a standard gauge night mail train from Paddington to Plymouth over the LSWR route while its own line was being worked on. Meanwhile, double track from Coleford Junction to Copplestone was opened on 4 November 1883. This was followed by doubling from Umberleigh to Pill Bridge, a location about a mile south of Barnstaple Junction. Pill Bridge was a substantial crossing of the tidal River Taw; there were three spans of over 80 feet, and when the bridge had been completed for double track, this last section to Barnstaple Junction, opened as double track on 27 July 1891. The intermediate section from Copplestone to Umberleigh was also to be doubled, and powers were obtained and a contract let; however at this time the LSWR concluded a traffic pooling agreement with the GWR and decided not to proceed, cancelling the contract; earthworks and some bridgeworks had been executed, and ¬£75,640 expended, but the section was never doubled. ==From 1923== Following the exhaustion of the railways of Great Britain in the First World War, Parliament decided to force amalgamation of most of the railways into four new companies. This was brought about by the Railways Act 1921 and is usually referred to as the grouping. The LSWR became part of the new Southern Railway from 1923. The Southern Railway became especially effective in marketing, and the train service from London to the Devon lines was given a boost when the principal express from London, leaving Waterloo at 11 a.m., was named the Atlantic Coast Express. The train conveyed portions for the respective branches in Devon, detached successively at junction stations; at the busiest summer period the train ran in multiple portions throughout from London. ===South of Torrington=== At Torrington the line met the Torrington and Marland Railway, a narrow gauge line opened in 1880 to carry ball clay. In 1925 part of this line was converted to standard gauge and extended to Halwill Junction station as the North Devon and Cornwall Junction Light Railway. ==Twentieth century train service== As a rural railway, the North Devon group originally had the light train service that was normal. Development of the North Devon seaside towns as holiday resorts took place towards the end of the nineteenth century, although they remained far less important than their southern counterparts. As the rural manufacturing and shipping importance of the area declined, the significance of Crediton, Fremington and Bideford waned also; ball clay however gained importance at Torrington. Barnstaple became the most significant market town in the region, and Ilfracombe became the dominant holiday destination on the North Devon network The train service in 1938 was eight trains each way daily, calling at all or most stations. In addition there were two through trains from London Waterloo, the Atlantic Coast Express and an unnamed train. The local trains took 80 minutes or so for the journey from Exeter to Barnstaple. The expresses were in truth portions of multiple portion trains; the front portion was detached at Exeter Central and ran non-stop from Exeter St Davids to Barnstaple Junction, dividing there with portions for Ilfracombe and Torrington. Journey time from Waterloo to Barnstaple was typically 4 hrs 20 mins, for a distance of 211 miles (340 km). The best time from Exeter St Davids to Barnstaple Junction in 1938 was 57 minutes for the 39 miles (63 km). On Sundays there were two local trains and the two expresses. The line from Barnstaple to Torrington had 13 daily trains calling at both intermediate stations, and 7 each way on Sundays. In addition, the original Exeter & Crediton section and the short length to Coleford Junction, carried all the Plymouth traffic. Economic stagnation in North Devon in the twentieth century meant that the train service failed to develop, and the North Devon lines remained single track. The through London services disappeared with the rationalisation of West Country operations, and in 1964Working Time Table, Section P, Winter 1964/65, British Railways Western Region there were ten stopping trains each way daily from Exeter to Ilfracombe. Barnstaple Junction to Bideford kept nine trains daily, and both routes retained a Sunday service. The Beeching Axe started to impose its cuts, and in 1965 the Torrington branch closed to passengers, in 1970 the Ilfracombe line was closed, and the freight- only Barnstaple to Torrington and Meeth section in 1982. Currently (2012) there are 14 daily trains each way between Exeter St Davids and Barnstaple, calling at all or most stations and taking between 65 and 76 minutes. There are seven trains on Sundays. ==Stations and routeExeter & Crediton Railway=== * Cowley Bridge Junction (with the Bristol & Exeter Railway) * St Cyres; renamed Newton St Cyres 1913 * Crediton ===North Devon Railway=== Eggesford * from E&CR; Crediton station * Yeoford * Coleford Junction; Okehampton line diverges * Copplestone * Morchard Road * Lapford * Eggesford * South Molton Road (Renamed Kings Nympton in 1951; South Molton was away and had a Devon & Somerset Railway station) * Portsmouth Arms * Umberleigh * Chapeltown (Renamed Chapelton 1875) * Barnstaple Note: Barnstaple station was named Barnstaple Junction between 1874 and 1970, but Cobb dates the addition of \\"Junction\\" at 1855.

Most of the locomotives were bought from the Bristol and Gloucester Railway (B&GR;), but a few were also built by him at his Canada Works in Birkenhead. Brassey's locomotives continued to operate on the line after the London and South Western Railway bought the line, until it was converted to narrow gauge. ===Bristol and Gloucester 2-2-2=== Five 2-2-2 locomotives originally built by Stothert & Slaughter for the B&GR.; These had 6 ft 6 in driving wheels and 3 ft. 6 in. carrying wheels with cylinders of 15 in. dia. √ó 21 in. stroke. * Barum (1855‚Äì1870) Previously B&GR; Berkeley, named after the medieval Latin for Barnstaple ‚Äì Barumensis. * Exe (1856‚Äì1870) Previously B&GR; Bristol, named after the River Exe which follows the railway into Exeter. * Mole (1855‚Äì1870) Previously B&GR; Stroud, named after the local River Mole. * Star (1855‚Äì1877) Previously B&GR; Cheltenham. * Tite (1856‚Äì1870) Previously B&GR; Gloucester.The architect William Tite had been Chairman of the North Devon Railway. ===Bristol and Gloucester 2-4-0=== Another Stothert & Slaughter locomotive from the B&GR;, where it was named Industry, this one was a 2-4-0 with 5 ft. 0 in. driving wheels and cylinders of 15 in. dia. √ó 18 in. stroke. * Venus (1856‚Äì1870) ===Bristol and Gloucester 0-6-0=== The final two locomotives obtained from the B&GR; were two 0-6-0 goods locomotives built by the Vulcan Foundry.

For many years they played in the Hampshire League but were forced to close in 1972 - just three years after winning the title, following the loss of their ground. ==History== Thornycroft Athletic FC were formed in 1900, as the works side of the Thornycroft vehicle manufacturing company, and three years later they became founder members of the Basingstoke League where they twice won the title. In 1912 Thornycroft Athletic joined the North Division of the Hampshire League but in their first two seasons they twice finished bottom but were re-elected each time. After the horrors of the Great War they were placed in the County Division (later to become Division 1) and in 1921 they finished runners-up, and also reached the final of the Hampshire Senior Cup where they beaten by Southampton Reserves. Thornycrofts remained a steady side in the top flight before being relegated as bottom club in 1931‚Äì32 and after finishing mid-table in Division 2 the following season the side withdrew from the competition to join the Southern Amateur League, winning the Senior Division 3 title in 1934-35.http://www.southernamateurleague.co.uk/ When normal football resumed after World War II, Thornycrofts returned to the Hampshire League and were placed in Division 1. The post-war era saw the club remain a steady force in the league and were regular entrants in the qualifying rounds of the FA Cup but relegation in 1950‚Äì51 saw a decline in fortunes. After several years of re-building Thornycrofts won the Division 2 title in 1955‚Äì56 and returned to Division 1 where they remained for three seasons before again being relegated. The early sixties saw Thornycrofts alternate between Divisions 1 and 2 but after winning promotion back as runners-up in 1963‚Äì64 their fortunes dramatically took off.https://www.nonleaguematters.co.uk/nlmnet/Aarg3E/Ham60.html Back in the top flight, Thornycrofts became a powerful force and after some encouraging seasons they won the title in 1968‚Äì69, three points clear of local rivals Basingstoke Town ‚Äì with whom they fought many an epic battle, often in front of large crowds. Also at this time Thornycrofts also enjoyed some good runs in the qualifying rounds of the FA Cup and FA Trophy.http://www.fchd.info/THORNYCA.HTM In 1969, the parent company relocated to Watford but the football team continued, enjoying further successes, but this was brought to an abrupt end in the summer of 1972 when the sudden loss of their ground forced the club to withdraw from the county league and fold. ==Honours== *Hampshire League Division 1 **Champions 1968/69 **Runners-up 1920/21 *Hampshire League Division 2 **Champions 1955/56 **Runners-up 1963/64 *Southern Amateur Football League Senior Division 3 **Champions 1934/35 *Hampshire FA Senior Cup **Finalists 1920/21 *Hampshire FA Russell Cotes Cup **Winners 1924/25 and 1966/67 *North Hants FA May Cup **Winners 1919/20 and 1920/21 *Basingstoke & District League **Champions 1911/12 *Basingstoke Junior Cup **Winners 1911/12 ==Playing Records League === { class=\\" collapsible collapsed\\" style=text-align:center !Season !Division !Position !Significant events -

His height was 197 cm and his weight was 166 kg. He left Edo to fight in Osaka sumo. In Osaka, he debuted at west ≈çzeki in 1737. It is said that he lost only two bouts in his career. He is considered to have been a strong wrestler but it has not been proven that he was awarded a yokozuna license. In honor of him, the house of Yoshida Tsukasa allowed him to be their disciple from August 1749 but this did not confer him the status of yokozuna. However, there are tales told that he wore a black-and-white rope. Though it was not a traditional shimenawa, Masahiko Nomi conjectured that it may have been related to the shimenawa. Maruyama died in Nagasaki while an active sumo wrestler on November 14, 1749 possibly from dysentery. His grave lies in Nagasaki, Nagasaki Prefecture. A statue of him stands in Yoneyama, Tome, Miyagi. It was not until over 150 years after his death that Maruyama was recognised as the third yokozuna by later yokozuna Jinmaku when he was compiling a formal list for a monument.

Due to the extended reshuffling of the structure for the 2008 campaign, survival in Divisions 1A and 1B, was much more precarious--with four relegation places in these divisions, the bottom two teams were relegated to Division 3, and the teams finishing in 5th place and 6th places were relegated to Division 2. Donegal won the 2007 National Football League by securing the Division One title, a historic achievement and their first National Football League title. They were unbeaten throughout the competition. Meath won the Division Two title. The Dublin vs. Tyrone match was the first Gaelic football match held in Croke Park under floodlights. ==FormatDivision One=== The top two teams from both division one A and B go on to qualify for the league semi finals and then the winning team goes on to qualify for the final. The winner of the final game are the football league champions. The bottom two teams in Division one A and B are relegated to Division three of the next format for 2008. The teams who finish in fifth and sixth place in Division A and B are relegated to Division two in the new 2008 format. The teams in first, second, third and fourth position in both Division A and B qualify to play in the new 2008 format in Division One. ===Division two=== The top two teams from Division two A and B go on to qualify for the division two semi finals. The winners of the semi final go on to play in the Division two finals and the winner becomes the 2007 Division two champions. The top two teams in Division 2A and 2B go on to play in Division 2 in the 2008 format. The teams that finish in third and fourth position go on to play in Division 3 of the 2008 format and the bottom four teams will play in Division four of the 2008 format. ===Scoring Difference=== All of the final positions in the league will be determined by each team's scoring, there will be no playoffs in the 2007 National Football League. If two teams finish the league on the same points, the scores are then taken into consideration and the team with the best average go to the higher position. If the teams remain equal after the scores have been averaged out, the result of the game which involved the two teams will be seen as the deciding factor between the teams. ==Division OneDivision 1A Table=== { style=border- collapse:collapse border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5 - align=center bgcolor=#efefef !Team !Pld !W !D !L !F !A !Diff !Pts !Notes - align=center E8FFD8;\\" style=\\"text-align:left;\\"Donegal 7 6 1 0 10-79 8-64 +21 13rowspan=2Advance to NFL semi-final - align=center E8FFD8;\\" style=\\"text-align:left;\\"Mayo 7 6 0 1 8-72 5-66 +15 12 - align=center FFFFFF;\\" style=\\"text-align:left;\\"Kerry 7 4 1 2 3-786-62 +7 9rowspan=2Remain in Division 1 - align=center FFFFFF;\\" style=\\"text-align:left;\\"Tyrone 7 3 1 3 3-68 6-69  ‚Äì10 7 - align=center FFFACD;\\" style=\\"text-align:left;\\"Dublin 7 3 0 4 6-73 2-66+19 6rowspan=2Relegated to Division 2 of the 2008 NFL - align=center FFFACD;\\" style=\\"text-align:left;\\"Cork 7 3 0 4 7-614-70 +10 6 - align=center FFCCCC;\\" style=\\"text-align:left;\\"Limerick 7 1 1 56-678-73 ‚Äì12 3rowspan=2Relegated to Division 3 of the 2008 NFL - align=center FFCCCC;\\" style=\\"text-align:left;\\"Fermanagh 7 0 0 7 4-53 8-81  ‚Äì40 0 } ===Division 1B Table=== { style=border- collapse:collapse border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5 - align=center bgcolor=#efefef !Team !Pld !W !D !L !F !A !Diff !Pts !Notes - align=center E8FFD8;\\" style=\\"text-align:left;\\"Galway 7 5 0 2 6-68 2-66 +1410rowspan=2Advance to NFL semi-final - align=center E8FFD8;\\" style=\\"text-align:left;\\"Kildare 7 4 2 1 2-77 4-66 +510 - align=center FFFFFF;\\" style=\\"text-align:left;\\"Derry 7 4 1 2 6-826-66 +16 9rowspan=2Remain in Division 1 - align=center FFFFFF;\\" style=\\"text-align:left;\\"Laois 7 3 3 1 6-79 4-71  +149 - align=center FFFACD;\\" style=\\"text-align:left;\\"Westmeath 7 3 0 4 4-67 6-69‚Äì8 6rowspan=2Relegated to Division 2 of the 2008 NFL - align=center FFFACD;\\" style=\\"text-align:left;\\"Armagh 7 3 0 4 5-622-81 ‚Äì10 6 - align=center FFCCCC;\\" style=\\"text-align:left;\\"Louth 7 2 1 48-777-86 ‚Äì75rowspan=2Relegated to Division 3 of the 2008 NFL - align=center FFCCCC;\\" style=\\"text-align:left;\\"Down 7 0 1 6 2-73 8-79  ‚Äì241 } ===Semi-Finals=== \\\\---- ===Final=== ==Division two== ==Division 2A== { style=border-collapse:collapse border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5 - align=center bgcolor=#efefef !width=165Team !width=20Pld !width=20W !width=20D !width=20L !width=20Pts diff !width=20Pts - align=center style=\\"background:yellow;\\" style=\\"text-align:left;\\"Monaghan 7 7 0 0 +40 14 - align=center style=\\"background:yellow;\\" style=\\"text-align:left;\\"Roscommon 7 5 0 2 +17 10 - align=center style=\\"background:white;\\" style=\\"text-align:left;\\"Longford 7 3 1 3 +31 8 - align=center style=\\"background:white;\\" style=\\"text- align:left;\\"Leitrim 7 4 0 3 +8 8 - align=center style=\\"background:red;\\" style=\\"text-align:left;\\"Offaly 7 3 1 3 +18 6 - align=center style=\\"background:red;\\" style=\\"text-align:left;\\"Clare 7 3 0 4 -5 6 - align=center style=\\"background:red;\\" style=\\"text- align:left;\\"Carlow 7 1 0 6 -51 2 - align=center style=\\"background:red;\\" style=\\"text-align:left;\\"London 7 0 0 7 -58 0 } Yellow - Qualified for Division Two semi-finals White - relegated to Division Three Red - relegated to Division Four ===Round One=== \\\\---- \\\\---- \\\\---- \\\\---- ===Round Two=== \\\\---- \\\\---- \\\\---- \\\\---- ===Round Three=== \\\\---- \\\\---- The result was declared null by the GAA;

He has shown work internationally in many exhibitions including solo shows ‚ÄúThe Furnishers‚Äù at White Columns in New York City, ‚ÄúGalleon and Other Stories‚Äù at the Saatchi Gallery in London, ‚ÄúEngland Their England‚Äù at Laden fur Nichts in Leipzig, ‚ÄúBeck's Futures 2004‚Äù at the ICA in London and the CCA in Glasgow, Cell Project Space, London, 2004, Studio Voltaire London, 2009, Piper Keys, London and Hospitalfield House, Arbroath in 2017. Simon Bedwell spent most of his art career as a member of the London-based collective BANK,Art in America review of BANK, February 1999.since the group‚Äôs 2003 split becoming a successful artist in his own right. His most widely known works combine second-hand posters with carefully selected slogans produced using WordArt, stencils and spray paint. This strand of Bedwell‚Äôs practice is typical of his methods; the juxtaposition of found imagery with purpose built text creates an often funny, politically apposite, yet highly convincing brand-new object. His work functions via a critique of advertising, logoism, signs and signifiers; picking holes in means of representation favoured by the mass media to discover the limits of tolerance and relevance of ‚Äòrebellious‚Äô acts, and believability, within a given context. Following the solo exhibition Gents: A Melodrama with 2 Acts at Platform, London in 2005, Bedwell's work has featured a mix of more complicated subject matter and concerns. As Matthew Higgs wrote for Bedwell press release for 2007's White Columns show, 'In his works Bedwell often collides conflicting aesthetics and visual languages, which variously include soft-porn imagery, the popular gothic (often in the form of horror movie posters), institutional and bureaucratic architecture(s), advertising, modernist painting, and sardonic sloganeering. Seen together, Bedwell‚Äôs interventions establish a complex narrative that both engages with and confuses contemporary political and social mores. With a deft humor his work both conflates and disrupts issues of class, race, sexual politics and art.' Throughout July 2011 he curated The Hole, a series of 5 'long weekend' exhibitions in a newly built space off Walworth Road, London, featuring new work from Katrina Palmer, Lucy Clout, Phillip Lai, Tom Benson, Alice Channer, Leah Capaldi and Claire Carter, alongside work from Merve Kaptan and Laure Prouvost and others, in configurations changing daily and all featuring performances. Photography and film was banned, and each weekend had its own numbered publication. From 2011 to date, Bedwell has been concentrating on ceramic sculpture. BANK consisted of Bedwell and other artists ‚Äì Dino Demosthenous, David Burrows, John Russell, Milly Thompson and Andrew Williamson ‚Äì who, throughout the 1990s and up until 2003, were a consistent presence on the London art-scene. BANK regularly hosted shows in their own warehouse space which combined the work of the group with that of other, often very well known, artists in schizophrenic installations where it was often impossible to tell where one work ended and another began. The group also regularly produced art-world-baiting material in the form of satirical exhibition invitations, provocative show titles, their own tabloid newspaper ridiculing the excesses of the London scene and a campaign to improve gallery press releases that involved returning said documents to galleries with corrections to grammar and tips for improvement. ==References== ==External links== *Simon Bedwell at ArtFacts.Net *Simon Bedwell ‚Äì Saatchi Gallery Category:English artists Category:Living people Category:1963 births Category:People from Croydon ","title":"Simon Bedwell"},{"id":"9110425","text":"School Days may refer to: == Film and fiction == * School Days (1920 film), American comedy starring Larry Semon * School Days (1921 film), American comedy starring Wesley Barry * School Days (1995 film), a Taiwan teen drama * School Days (novel), 2005 by Robert B.

He is considered one of the most important writers from Silesia.Hierowski 1947, 97. ==Biography== In 1891, Morcinek was born in Karvin√° into a poor family, the youngest of four siblings. In 1892, his father J√≥zef died and his mother was forced to provide for the family. Augustyn started work in the coal mine at the age of 16, which was quite late compared to the standard of those times. When he was 19, miners raised money for his education and he started attending a teachers' seminary in Bia≈Ça Krakowska, from which he graduated in 1914. In 1914 he was drafted into the Austro-Hungarian Army and after 1918 served briefly in the Polish Army. In 1920, when Cieszyn Silesia was divided between Poland and Czechoslovakia, his hometown Karvin√° fell to Czechoslovakia. Morcinek was a pro-Polish activist and thus decided to stay in Poland. In the 1920s and 1930s he worked as a teacher in Skocz√≥w. ===Interwar period=== During the interwar period, Morcinek published many articles in various Silesian press. He wrote his most important books in the late 1920s and early 1930s becoming the only notable Silesian Polish-language prosaist of the interwar period. His works concentrate mostly on coal mining and Silesian themes. Morcinek shows miners' work and life in a realistic way and accentuates the class character of national oppression of Polish miners.Hierowski 1947, 81. Morcinek spent the years 1936-1939 abroad, in Western Europe. ===World War II=== He returned to Poland shortly before the outbreak of World War II. Morcinek was arrested by the Gestapo on 6 September 1939. He was initially imprisoned with W≈Çadys≈Çaw Dworaczek and the rest of people belonging to the Polish intellectuals from Silesia. Gustaw spent the whole war in the German concentration camps Skrochowitz,Village of Skrochovice is a part of the Brumovice municipality near Opava, Silesia, Czech Republic. During the war it was a part of Germany. Sachsenhausen and Dachau.Hierowski 1947, 193. The supposed reason given for his arrest was his \\"anti-German activity\\" before the war and the fact that a dog in one of his novels (\\"WyrƒÖbany chodnik\\") was called \\"Bismarck\\". When he was in concentration camps, he was given a choice to sign a Volksliste but refused.A Volksliste was a document introduced by the Nazi authorities; a non- German citizen declared that he had some German ancestry by signing it. Refusal to sign this document could lead to deportation to a concentration camp. Non-German citizens from territories belonging to Nazi Germany were forced to sign it. ===After the war=== Monument to Gustaw Morcinek in Skocz√≥w Since his release until November 1946 Morcinek resided in France, Italy and Belgium and cooperated with Polish √©migr√© press there.Hierowski 1947, 79-80. He then returned to Silesia, Poland, and settled in Katowice. He was then actively supported by new authorities. Morcinek resumed his writing and continued to concentrate on Silesian issues but widen his scope to books for children and also epistolography. He received many recognitions and literary awards for his work and many of his books were translated and published abroad. Gustaw Morcinek died of leukemia on 20 December 1963 in Krak√≥w and was later buried at Communal Cemetery in Cieszyn. ==Political activity== Morcinek was politically active from a young age. He was an active advocate of joining whole Cieszyn Silesia to Poland. During the interwar period when he was an anti-German activist, some critics accused him of spreading hatred. After the war, he was a supporter of Polish United Workers' Party and was a member of the Sejm (parliament) from Katowice electoral district (1952‚Äì1957). ==WorksNovellas and novellas collections=== * Noc listopadowa (1927) * W kwietniowƒÖ noc (1928) * Zgaszony p≈Çomyk (1928) * O te ≈õwiƒôtƒÖ ziemeczkƒô (1929) * Serce za tamƒÖ (1929) * Cisza (1930) * Mi√≥d w sercu (1930) * Chleb na kamieniu (1931) * Na bieda-szybie (1932) * Sze≈õƒá dni (1932) * Dzieje wƒôgla (1933) * Kataryniarz (1933) * W zadymionym s≈Ço≈Ñcu (1933) * U≈õmiech na drodze (1935) * Go≈Çƒôbie na dachu (1936) * Po kamienistej drodze (1936) * W najm≈Çodszym lesie (1937) * Maszerowa (1938) * Miasteczko nad rzekƒÖ (1938) * Kr√≥lewski d≈Çug (1939) ===Short story collections=== * Byli dwaj bracia (1930) * WyrƒÖbany chodnik (1931‚Äì32) * In≈ºynier Szeruda (1937) * Wyorane kamienie (1939) * Dziewczyna z P√≥l Elizejskich (1946) * Listy z mojego Rzymu (1946) * Wr√≥≈ºbita (1946) * Dwie korony (1948) * Zagubione klucze (1948) * Pod gongiem (1949) * Pok≈Çad Joanny (1951) * W Nysie na rynku (1952) * Odkryte skarby (1953) * Ondraszek (1953) * W Wiergulowej dziedzinie (1953) * Viktoria (1954) * Wskrzeszenie Herminy (1956) * Z mojej ziemi (publicystyka) (1956) * Judasz u Monte Sicuro (1957) * Czarna Julka (1959) * Siedem zegark√≥w kopido≈Ça Joachima Rybki (1960) * Opowie≈õci o ludziach z pociƒÖgu (1963) * G√≥rniczy zakon (1964) ===Fairy tales collections=== * Jak g√≥rnik Bulandra diab≈Ça oszuka≈Ç (1961) * Przedziwne ≈õlƒÖskie powiarki (1961) * Przedziwna historia o zb√≥jniku Ondraszku (1963) ===Books for children=== * Narodziny serca (1932) * Gwiazdy w studni (1933) * ≈Åysek z pokladu Idy (1933) * Ludzie sƒÖ dobrzy (1935) * Miasteczko nad rzekƒÖ (1938) ===Other works=== * ≈ölƒÖsk (1933) * Listy spod morwy (1945) * Listy spod morwy (1946) * Zab≈ÇƒÖkane ptaki * Urodzaj ludzi * Ziemia cieszy≈Ñska ==Footnotes== ==References== * * * Category:1891 births Category:1963 deaths Category:People from Karvin√° Category:Austro-Hungarian military personnel of World War I Category:Polish Austro-Hungarians Category:Polish military personnel Category:Polish male writers Category:Polish educators Category:Polish communists Category:Polish people from Zaolzie Category:Recipients of the Order of Polonia Restituta Category:Deaths from leukemia Category:Deaths from cancer in Poland Category:Sachsenhausen concentration camp survivors Category:Dachau concentration camp survivors Category:Members of the Polish Sejm 1952‚Äì1956 ","title":"Gustaw Morcinek"},{"id":"9110487","text":"Vadim Milov (born 1 August 1972) is a Swiss grandmaster of chess. ==Early life== Born in Ufa,Vadim Milov.

In addition to airing in syndication, the show was carried nationwide over Superstation WGN, which aired the show at 2 PM ET until its final weeks when they moved the show to 2 AM ET. The network replaced the show with The Steve Wilkos Show in the slot following its final episode. The show was also streamed on the Sony website. ==Show format== Stand-up comedian and writer Greg Behrendt presided over a show that more often than not discussed relationship problems with couples of all types. Other episodes included makeover shows (called \\"Greg-overs\\" on the show) and confrontations about other issues not related to a relationship. In each and every episode, the following segments aired: * The Uncomfortable Phone Call: Greg and a guest would speak with someone on the phone (who could be heard in the studio) and discuss a problem that the guest and that person had. * Greg Behrendt Undercover: Towards the end of every episode, a hidden camera segment featuring Behrendt would focus on something in a humorous manner (e.g., how a supermarket is really a haven for any kind of sexual fetish you might have). ==Ratings history== Behrendt's show was one of four syndicated talk shows to debut in the fall of 2006 (Rachael Ray, Dr. Keith Ablow, and The Megan Mullally Show were the other three), and much like every series except for Rachael Ray suffered in the ratings.

The mistletoebird eats mainly the berries of the parasitic mistletoe and is a vector for the spread of the mistletoe's seeds through its digestive system.del Hoyo, J. et al., eds. (2008). Handbook of the Birds of the World 13: 388. . ==Taxonomy and evolution== The mistletoebird is one of 44 species of the flowerpecker family Dicaeidae. The flowerpeckers are considered to be nearest in avian evolutionary relationship to the sunbird family Nectariniidae. Both the flowerpeckers and sunbirds are thought to be early offshoots of the early passeroid radiation that occurred 20-30 million years ago. The sunbirds are found mainly in Africa and Asia and the flowerpeckers throughout Asia. The mistletoebird is a geologically recent arrival into Australia from South-East Asia. It is thought to have started colonizing Australia from about two million years ago. The mistletoebird is a mistletoe- feeding specialist and mistletoe-feeding specialists have evolved independently in eight of the world's avian families. This extreme dietary specialization has evolved in non-passerine species, as well as sub-oscine and oscine passerines. Early scientific research had the mistletoe and mistletoebird mutually co-evolving with a high dependence on each other through their evolutionary development. As the mistletoe has been in Australia for a long time and mistletoebirds for a relatively short time, the mistletoe seed was distributed originally by non-specialized frugivore birds like the honeyeater. Even though the mistletoebird has evolved into a very efficient local distributor of mistletoe seeds, the mistletoebird needs the mistletoe but the mistletoe does not need the mistletoebird. Molecular-based scientific methods have been used recently to evaluate generic taxonomy within the flowerpecker family. The flowerpecker genetic subdivision is based on a single morphological character ‚Äî the length of the outermost primary wing feather. Most flowerpeckers are sexually dichromatic, have stouter bills than sunbirds and display a broad variety of tongue structure. Genetic analysis of mitochondrial DNA of 70% of flowerpecker species showed that the mistletoebird and the red-capped flowerpecker (D. geelvinkianum) to be each other's closest relative. The specific epithet hirundinaceum derives from the name of the swallow (Hirundo) and refers to its long and pointed swallow-like wings. ===Subspecies=== There are four recognised subspecies, which differ in geographical location and plumage details, primarily of the males: *Dicaeum hirundinaceum hirundinaceum Shaw & Nodder, 1792 ‚Äî Australia (extensive red on throat and chest; flanks grey) *Dicaeum hirundinaceum keiense Salvadori, 1874 ‚Äî Watubela archipelago, Indonesia (red on chest limited) *Dicaeum hirundinaceum ignicolle G. R. Gray, 1858 ‚Äî Aru Islands, Indonesia (flanks yellow-buff) *Dicaeum hirundinaceum fulgidum P. L. Sclater, 1883 ‚Äî Tanimbar Islands, Indonesia (flanks buff, red on chest limited, and throat pale buff) ==Description== The mistletoebird is small, long and weight. The male is glossy blue-black above, with a red chest and a slight red under-tail, and a black center stripe running down its white belly. The female is dark grey above, with a white throat, light grey underparts, and just a touch of pinkish-red under the tail. The eyes, bill, and legs are black; the bill is just over a centimeter long, slender, slightly down-curved and sharply pointed. Immature birds are similar to the female, but have an orange-pink bill instead of black. There is a variance in size and color across their distribution. The adult mistletoebird is smaller in the north of its distribution and females in the north have lighter colored underparts compared to darker ones in the south. The mistletoebird has long pointed wings and a short square tail with a slight notch at the tip. They usually occur singularly or in twos but occasionally in small family groups or flocks and very occasionally in mixed-species flocks when food is in abundance. Their flight is swift and they are usually seen flying above or high in the tree canopy on distinctively pointed wings. Their posture is usually upright when perched but adopt a more horizontal, swaying posture when alarmed. They have a variety of vocalizations but their most familiar is a short, sharp, high- pitched tzew or dzee whistled mainly on the wing. Songs while perched include a whistled wissweet wissweet uttered repeatedly. The male mistletoe bird can be mistaken for a scarlet robin (Petroica boodang) or flame robin (Petroica phoenicea), but it has no spot on the forehead and has a black streak on the white belly. Due to the combination of size, shape, behaviour, and plumage the mistletoebird is unlikely to be mistaken for any other Australian passerine; however, the pardalote and thornbill are the closest in size and shape. ==BehaviourHabitat=== Mistletoe in Eucalyptus woodland. Central New South Wales. Mistletoebirds are nomadic where movement is generally local and is associated with the fruiting of mistletoe. Mistletoebirds mostly occur in forests and woodlands dominated by any species of Eucalyptus from the dry interior to the coastal rain forests, but they do not frequent high altitude areas in winter as they adopt a torpid state when cold. Mistletoebirds are more likely to occur in mature stands where trees are larger and more likely to have become infested with mistletoe, rather than in regenerated areas. There are over 1300 species of mistletoe around the world and about 100 in Australia, where a common variety in the drier climates is the grey mistletoe (Amyema quandang). All mistletoes share a common growth form where water and nutrients are obtained from their host tree via a specialized vascular attachment, but as mistletoe manufacture their own carbohydrates using photosynthesis, they are referred to as 'half parasitic'. Although common on the mainland of Australia, there are no mistletoes in Tasmania. Less specialized fruit-eating species, such as the honeyeater, source much of their protein from arthropods. To source the arthropods, the honeyeaters venture far and, therefore, are a conduit for long distance mistletoe seed dispersal, while the mistletoebirds generally concentrate on and limit their feeding to local mistletoe infestations. Recent ecological studies have found the mistletoe producing a rich biodiversity in areas where it proliferates. The litter-fall under mistletoe infestation, where there is a high turnover of rich mistletoe leaves, has a diverse animal and plant life. Also, the denseness of the mistletoe bush and the characteristics of its leaves makes it a cool and safe place for birds to rest, hide, and nest. In a recent study in southern Australia, 217 species of Australian arboreal birds were reported nesting in mistletoe, including the mistletoebird. === Feeding === The mistletoebird is a specialist frugivore that primarily eats the berries of mistletoes. Foraging time takes up 25% of the mistletoebird's daytime activities in summer and 29% in winter. The increased fruit consumption in winter could be related to the bird's increased thermo-regulatory costs during the cold of winter. Mistletoe fruit dominates the mistletoebird's diet accounting for 85% of foraging observations. Arthropods formed 13% and the remainder was from nectar, insects, and other berries. The only other known frugivore with a similar degree of dietary specialization is Pesquet's parrot (or vulturine parrot) of New Guinea that feeds almost exclusively on strangler figs. In becoming frugivore specialists, both these birds live off the fruit of parasites that germinate in the canopy of host trees, where the fruit of the parasite has specific seed placement requirements on host branches and resists consumption by frugivore nonspecialist birds. The mistletoe plant minimizes opportunistic consumption of their berries by less specialized dispersal birds by producing few, inconspicuous fruits over a long period. Specialist frugivorous birds, by eating mainly fruit, have a diet rich in carbohydrates and poor in protein. To increase the protein level, which is particularly important for reproduction and molting, the mistletoe bird has to eat large quantities of the mistletoe fruit. === Feeding adaptations === Deposited mistletoe seed. Sticky, to facilitate propagation in the host tree. The mistletoebird has a small muscularized stomach and short alimentary canal, where the amount of mechanical grinding and chemical digestion is minimized. This enables a clear passage and quick exit of the mistletoe fruit seeds through the mistletoebird's digestive system. In comparison, the non- specialized fruit-eating birds that they compete with for the mistletoe berry, such as the spiny-cheeked honeyeater (Acanthagenys rufogularis), have a more complex digestive system that takes longer for the fruit seeds to pass, and in the process the seeds are subjected to more mechanical and chemical action in the gut. It takes between 4‚Äì25 minutes for the mistletoe seed to pass through the mistletoebird. In a scientific study in South Australia with the grey mistletoe (Amyema quandang), it took 2.3 times longer for the mistletoe seeds to pass through the digestive system of a spiny-cheeked honeyeater (A. rufogularis) than it did through the mistletoebird and five months after seed deposit, 43% more seedlings had established from seeds defecated by mistletoebirds than from seeds passed by the honeyeater. The mistletoebird's modified gastrointestinal tract is in the same plane. This facilitates rapid passage of the large number of berries consumed. Comparing the frugivore mistletoebird with a similarly sized insectivore the inland thornbill (Acanthiza inornata), where both their body masses are approximately . The mean length of the gizzard in the mistletoebird is and in the thornbill. The mean length of the small intestine is in the mistletoebird and in the thornbill. The mistletoebird has a large gape relative to the size of its head and its total body size. This allows grasping and swallowing the mistletoe fruit, which are about long by in diameter. These are large berries relative to the diminutive mistletoebird. Efficiency of mistletoe fruit dispersal by the mistletoebird is increased by the way the bird perches on a branch to defecate. They sometimes stand facing along the host tree branch depositing seeds in a string on the perch. Honeyeater-dispersed seeds, in contrast, fall randomly and less efficiently onto substrates below the defecating bird. The texture of the defecated seed with the mistletoebird is stickier than other bird's feces to facilitate a strong bond with the host tree branch. ===Breeding=== Mistletoebirds conduct elaborate courtship and nuptial displays where, with a horizontal body, the male sways from side to side fluttering its wings, flicking its tail and displaying flashes of red. The female flies to a nearby branch where she flutters her wings. The male flies to her, mates and immediately they depart together. Mistletoebird pairs nest solitarily and raise up to 3 broods per season. The breeding season is from August to April depending where in Australia, but usually coincides with the fruiting of mistletoe. The nest can be found in many different plants but especially in eucalyptus, mistletoe, and acacia trees where it is suspended from an outer twig or thin horizontal branch and concealed among foliage. The nest is pear shaped with a slit side entrance and is usually made of plant down, wool, spider webs and spider egg sacs. The outside of the nest is coated with dry plant material like leaves, bark and lichen. The nest is built by the female, but accompanied by the male who assists very occasionally. Incubation is by the female but it has been recorded that males do sit the nest while the female is away. She will lay a clutch of three or four white eggs, each measuring , oval in shape. Incubation period is between 10‚Äì12 days and the young remain in the nest for approximately 15 days. The fledglings are fed by both parents but mainly by the female. Newly hatched birds are initially fed arthropods, after which mistletoe berry pulp is then gradually introduced into their diet. After about two weeks, when they are ready to fledge, the mistletoe berry pulp comprises 80% of food intake of the young mistletoebird. Both parents remove the fecal sacs left by the young in the nest. Image:Mistletoebird0696e.jpgFemale mistletoebird feeding young in a nest in southern Western Australia. Image:Mistletoebirds2819e.jpgThree young mistletoebirds in their nest waiting to be fed. Image:Mistletoebird3208e.jpgFledgling leaving its nest for the first time. === Other characteristics === The longevity of a mistletoebird has been recorded in southern Queensland, where a banded adult male was recaptured near the banding site after 9 years. Mistletoebirds vocally mimic other birds. Heard in all seasons and given by both sexes, they have been recorded mimicking the mulga parrot ( Psephotus varius), as well as more than 25 different species of passerines. Predators known to have taken mistletoebird nestlings are the grey shrike-thrush (Colluricincla harmonica), pied butcherbird (Cracticus nigrogularis), pied currawong (Strepera graculina), and the Australian raven (Corvus coronoides). Nests have also been parasitized by a number of cuckoo species, including Horsfield's bronze-cuckoo (Chrysococcyx basalis) and the fan-tailed cuckoo (Cacomantis flabelliformis). == Threats and human interaction == There was an ecological balance between the parasitic mistletoe and their host trees before this balance was disturbed with excessive forest clearing. Land clearing to accommodate farming practices and population growth created an imbalance that resulted in excessive infestations of mistletoe in some areas leading to forest degradation, and a total lack of mistletoe in other areas. Mistletoe density in Eucalyptus forests in Australia ranges from 0 to over 100 plants per hectare, where this high value is from highly damaged and perturbed habitat. From natural intact forests there are typically less than 10 plants per hectare. Avian richness increases with mistletoe density until a threshold of approximately 20 plants per hectare is reached after which heavy grazing and degradation sets in. Areas of excessive infestation of the parasite mistletoe badly damages or kills the host trees. The reaction to this was to try and eradicate the bird seen as spreading the parasite, the mistletoebird. One farmer in Australia in the 1930s claimed to have destroyed over 1200 mistletoebirds in a 6-year period, but they are no longer actively persecuted. ==References== Category:Dicaeum Category:Birds of Australia Category:Birds of the Maluku Islands Category:Birds described in 1792 ","title":"Mistletoebird"},{"id":"9110568","text":"The Southwest Cup is an open soccer tournament to Native American tribal teams in the Southwest United States.

The parish lies within the Forest of Bowland Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and contains the villages of Caton, Brookhouse, Caton Green, Littledale and Townend. ==History== The original settlement of Caton was renamed Brookhouse after Brookhouse Hall and is separated from modern Caton, originally Town End, by Artle Beck.\\"The History of Caton-with- Littledale\\", Caton Village Evidence of the Roman occupation in the area is from a mill stone, eight feet long found in Artle Beck in 1803, bearing the name of the Emperor Hadrian; and further engraved stone found some time later. Archaeological, place name and other evidence attests that Norse invaders settled in the area in the tenth century (Wainwright 1975). Caton is supposedly named from the Norse personal name Kati (Ekwall 1960), meaning 'cheerful' and ton. Geoffrey Hodgson (2008) argues that the Viking invasion of the area accounts for the relatively high frequency of the Hodgson surname in Caton and elsewhere in Lonsdale. In late 18th century five mills were built in Town End. Low Mill cotton mill was built for cotton weaving in 1783 on the site of a 13th-century corn mill. it was built by Thomas Hodgson (1738‚Äì1817), a slave-trader and son of a Liverpool merchant.(Hodgson 2008) It was powered by a millrace from the Artle Beck at Gresgarth. Water power was replaced by steam in 1819. In the mid 19th century there were two silk mills, two cotton mills, and a flax mill. In 1846 Ball Lane Mill was burnt down. Rumble Row Mill and Forge Mill operated until the 1930s and Willow Mill and Low Mill closed in the 1970s. In 1826 coal and slate were worked in Littledale and bobbins for the mills were made. In 1858 Adam Hodgson built a house which is now the Scarthwaite Hotel. ==Governance== Caton was a chapelry composed of four districts; Brookhouse, Caton Green, Littledale, and Town-End, and a township in the ecclesiastical parish of Lancaster in the Lonsdale hundred in Lancashire. ==Geography== Caton is 5 miles north-east of Lancaster on the road to Hornby in the valley of the River Lune. It covers over 8,000 acres of which 4,000 were moorland where stone was quarried. The township is hilly, Caton Moor in the east rises to over 1,000 feet (361 metres) above sea level and to the south rises to Clougha Pike at 1,355 feet (413 metres) and Ward's Stone at 1,841 feet (561 metres). The Artle Beck flows in a northerly direction towards the wider flatter valley of the River Lune. ==Transport== A turnpike road from Lancaster to Hornby and Kirkby Lonsdale, the A683, was constructed in 1812, bypassing the old route through Brookhouse and Caton Green. This road connects Caton to the M6 motorway to the west. Caton railway station was opened in 1850 on the \\"Little\\" North Western Railway between Wennington and Lancaster and closed in 1966. The section between Caton and Lancaster is now a popular cycle and pedestrian path. Former station building in 1986 ==Economy== The village was home to SJ Bargh haulage, including a Scania garage and repair plant, until the firm moved to Caton Road, Lancaster in 2015. The village of Caton has a health centre, pharmacy, Co-operative store, petrol station, Ford dealership, funeral director, the Station Hotel and the Ship Inn. It is also home to a cake shop specialising in custom-made cakes and other bakes. The village of Brookhouse has a Chinese fish and chip takeaway, a convenience store, a bridal shop and a hair salon, previously a florist and The Black Bull Inn public house. Specialist Bobbin maker T. Wildman & Sons operated in Copy Lane from 1859‚Äì1973..Lancashire County Council Accession number LANMS.1973.49 ==Landmarks== St Paul's Church An ancient oak tree, known as the Caton Oak, stands near the Ship Inn, on which the monks of Cockersand Abbey are supposed to have hung fish for sale. ==Religion== The original chapel built in about 1245 was rebuilt in the 1500s with a square tower. The present Church of St Paul is the parish church and, with the exception of the tower, was rebuilt between 1865-67 by Edward Graham Paley retaining some Norman features. There are other places of worship including Our Lady Immaculate Roman Catholic Church, Caton Methodist Church, Caton Baptist Church in and Brookhouse Methodist Church. There is a memorial to the younger Thomas Hodgson inside St Paul's Church, displaying the family's coat of arms. ==Cultural references== The beauty of the area was captured by the artist J M W Turner and described by the poet William Wordsworth. The poet Thomas Gray wrote, \\"every feature which constitutes a perfect landscape of the extensive sort is here not only boldly marked, but in its best position\\". When John Ruskin first saw the Lune Valley, he declared, \\"I do not know in all my country, still less France or Italy, a place more naturally divine or a more priceless possession of the true Holy Land...\\" ==Twinning== On 12 April 2008, a formal twinning agreement was signed with the village of Socx in France. ==See also== *Listed buildings in Caton-with-Littledale == References == Bibliography * Ekwall, Eilert (1960) The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-Names (Oxford: Clarendon Press). * Hodgson, Geoffrey M.

When Pleasureland closed in 2005, the ride was dismantled and moved to its current location where it has operated since. The original ride featured a red track with teal supports, however the track has since been repainted Persian Blue and the supports Midnight Blue . The ride has operated (both in its original and new form) since 1999 and cost a total of ¬£8 million to construct. ==Aesthetics== Infusion's structural support. Infusion was built and manufactured by Vekoma Rides Manufacturing based in the Netherlands. It is one of many 689m standard model SLC's found in amusement parks around the world. Riders are seated in eight rows of two for a total of 16 passengers per train with 2 trains being operated at any given time. Most Vekoma SLC's are capable of running up to 10 cars on each train however Vekoma modeled Infusion with only 8 to make the ride both smoother and faster. The ride can carry up to 832 riders per hour when both trains are in operation. The ride is decorated with water jets and fountains and at night is illuminated by floodlighting. Infusion can be found to the right of the Big Dipper on the Watson Overpass and guests must be between 132 cm and 200 cm to ride. ==Design & Layout== The ride begins with the train climbing a lift hill before arching into a steep curved incline. The train rises up into a butterfly loop- two half loops connected by a corkscrew - before pulling upwards into a banked apex. From here the train drops sharply into a sidewinder - a loop that transitions into a corkscrew. A tight helix follows, providing a near miss with the Big Dipper, before the train straightens itself and pulls into a double inline twist. From here the train rolls into a 90 degree turn before pulling downwards and ascending into the brakes. Two 90 degree turns return the train to the station. ==Marketing & Reception== The ride was the subject of a large marketing campaign and featured on BBC Newsround, the Daily Star and Daily Express newspapers and GMTV.

They are attached to Carrier Air Wing Three (CVW-3) while deployed aboard . The squadron nickname is the Screwtops. ==Squadron History== The history of VAW-123 begins in 1945 with the commissioning of Composite Squadron Twelve (VC-12), redesignated Carrier Airborne Early Warning Squadron Twelve (VAW-12), in 1956. On 1 April 1967, VAW-12 was disestablished and Carrier Airborne Early Warning Wing Twelve (CAEWW-12) was formed to command all Atlantic Fleet AEW efforts and all E-2A detachments were established as independent squadrons. ===1960s=== As a result of the reorganization, CAEWW-12, Detachment 59 was commissioned as Carrier Airborne Early Warning Squadron 123 on 1 April 1967, at NAS Norfolk, Virginia. The commissioning date of 1 April 1967, makes VAW-123 one of the oldest VAW Squadron in the United States Navy. In June 1967 VAW-123 set sail aboard for Vietnam, thus becoming the first East Coast VAW squadron to go to war. On 29 July 1967, while serving in the Gulf of Tonkin, USS Forrestal suffered an onboard fire resulting in the death of 134 crew members, 161 injured, 21 aircraft damaged or destroyed and millions of dollars in damage to the ship. USS Forrestal returned to Norfolk with VAW-123 and the rest of the ship's crew and Airwing. VAW-123 had no loss of any personnel or have any personnel injured in the fire but some of the squadrons E-2A aircraft had very minor damage from the fire and explosions aboard the ship. ===1970s=== VAW-123 E-2B lands on in 1972 Initially attached to CVW-17 aboard USS Forrestal, the squadron became an integral part of CVW-3 aboard and remained there throughout the 1970s. In 1972 VAW-123 again made an extended cruise to Vietnam waters in the Tonkin Gulf before returning to Norfolk in 1973. ===1980s=== In October 1980, the squadron transferred to CVW-11 (NH) aboard . Following a 1981 Indian Ocean deployment which saw the squadron and USS America make their only visit to Perth/Fremantle, Western Australia from 25-31 August 1981, VAW-123 transferred to CVW-1 (AB) on 12 November 1981. Since that time, the squadron made several extended Indian Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, and North Atlantic deployments as part of CVW-1/CV-66, until the decommissioning of USS America in 1996. The squadron participated in the 1986 Gulf of Sidra operations off the coast of Libya and was directly involved in the first combat use of the AGM-88 HARM and Harpoon weapon systems. ===1990s=== VAW-123 E-2C in flight 1991 Throughout the years, VAW-123 has received eleven Battle \\"E's\\" and nine \\"Safety S's,\\" the eleventh Battle \\"E\\" being awarded for 1999. Highlights of the command's history include the successful employment of the E-2C in 1973 and the first operational deployment of the E-2C ARPS (Advanced Radar Processing System) in 1978. In March 1996, they became the first E-2 squadron on the East Coast to transition to the E-2C Group II aircraft, with its significantly upgraded avionics and engines. In November 1998, they became the first operational squadron on the East Coast to accept delivery of the Navigation Upgrade E-2C Group II's. VAW-123 supported Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm and were the only E-2 squadron to operate in both the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf. The squadron also flew in support of Operations Deny Flight and Deliberate Force over Bosnia-Herzegovina and Operation Southern Watch over Iraq. The squadron, along with the rest of Carrier Air Wing One (CVW-1), attached to for one deployment cycle, returning home on 2 April 1998. On 18 May 1998, Carrier Air Wing One transferred from USS George Washington to . During July and August 1998, VAW-123 detached to Naval Station Roosevelt Roads, in support of the United States' ongoing efforts to stem the flow of narcotics through the Caribbean. In November and December 1998, the squadron detached to the newly commissioned in support of her shakedown cruise and Orange Air operations against Battle Group. ===2000s=== VAW-123 E-2C launches from Deploying in August 2003 with , VAW-123 became the first carrier-based Navy squadron to operate an expeditionary detachment in support of special warfare units. Under combat conditions with hostile fire in Northern Afghanistan, the squadron provided airborne command control to coalition aircraft and time sensitive targeting coordination to special operations forces for Operation Mountain Resolve. In that same deployment, VAW-123 supported conventional units as well as special operations forces deployed to Iraq in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. In March 2006 and 2007, VAW-123 again deployed with Carrier Air Wing One and USS Enterprise in support of the Iraq War and Enduring Freedom. ===2010s=== In 2011, the squadron deployed with Carrier Air Wing One on a six-month deployment in support of Operation Enduring Freedom and New Dawn. After an eight-month turnaround, the squadron deployed once again in March 2012 for eight months with Carrier Air Wing ONE on board USS Enterprise in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, flying 562 sorties and 1,935 mishap-free flight hours. Throughout 2012, the squadron participated in a variety of high-profile exercises with US Air Force, British Air Force, and Air National Guard. In 2013 VAW-123 received the Airborne Command Control and Logistics Wing \\"Top Hook\\" Award for having the best aircraft carrier landing grades of all East Coast E-2 squadrons. The squadron was deployed aboard USS Enterprise prior to the decommissioning of the ship in 2013 and then transferred to Carrier Air Wing 3, which is assigned to USS Dwight D. Eisenhower. On 1 January 2020, the squadron was redesignated as Airborne Command and Control Squadron 123 along with the other 8 USN E-2 squadrons to reflect the expanded role and responsibilities of the aircraft outside its original AEW focus. ==See also== * History of the United States Navy * List of United States Navy aircraft squadrons ==References== ==External links== * VAW-123 Official Page * US Navy Patrol Squadrons Category:Early warning squadrons of the United States Navy Category:Military units and formations in Virginia ","title":"VAW-123"},{"id":"9110645","text":"Thomas & Friends merchandise has been produced to capitalize on the success of the television series Thomas & Friends (formerly Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends). Whilst merchandise was produced alongside due to the popularity of the first of The Railway Series books by the Rev. W. Awdry since 1945, and the original broadcast of the television series in 1984 in the United Kingdom, large numbers of manufacturers have sought to produce Thomas-branded items after the television series was broadcast in America and Japan. The most popular and wide-ranging items of merchandise are the models of the characters, which have been produced in many different ranges, some including accompanying railway systems. The Rev. W. Awdry created the original toy model of Thomas the Tank Engine, which inspired the character, soon after the first book of stories was complete. In 1927, while still at school, he built Annie, and in 1948, he built Clarabel. Other popular products include videos, books and magazines, and computer games. 'Thomas' merchandise has also included such diverse items as: audiobooks, annuals, colouring and activity books, jigsaws, board games, stationery, clothing, cutlery, household items such as curtains, duvet covers and lampshades, and soft drinks and Spaghetti shapes. Thomas & Friends ranked number one in the preschool toys category in the U.S. and made the top 10 for the entire U.S. toy industry in 2010. In January 2011, Thomas & Friends ranked as the number-one preschool toy property in the U.K. for the 11th year in a row. Thomas is also a top-selling toy property in Australia, Germany, Japan and Korea. While the total traditional toy industry in the United States increased 1.9 per cent in 2010, overall Thomas & Friends toy sales increased over 47.1 per cent. In 2016, a version of the Nabi SE Android tablet themed after the series received FCC certification and was to be released alongside the American Girl, Barbie and Hot Wheels tablets, but as of no mention of such a device was made on Nabi or the series' official website. In 2015, Mattel made Thomas & Friends Minis to celebrate the 70th anniversary of Thomas. In 2016, the brand was so popular it was around for longer. ==CompaniesPre-Cut Model Engine Book=== The first commercial models released alongside The Railway Series, in 1957, were 'Pre-cut Model Engine Books'. These were full-colour printed cardboard kits whose pieces could be pressed out, folded and glued together to make fairly realistic models. They were produced through the 1960s. Four titles were published: *\\"Thomas, with Annie the Coach\\" *\\"Percy, with Clarabel the Coach\\" *\\"Gordon the Big Engine and his Tender\\" *\\"James the Red Engine and his Tender\\" The advertisements on the back of the Railway Series books promised, \\"Other models are being prepared\\", although, even if ever prepared, they were never published. A 12-page Thomas the Tank Engine Press-out Model Book () by the Rev. W. Awdry and Ken Stott, was released in September 1987. In 1994, a new range of press-out models was released, this time drawn by Ken Stott instead of C. Reginald Dalby. Each book came with accessories, track and a station. The range comprised the following characters: Thomas, Percy, James, Toby, Annie, Clarabel, Bertie the Bus, Harold the Helicopter. ===Meccano=== In 1965, Meccano Ltd released a train set featuring a clockwork model of Percy the Small Engine with some trucks ‚Äî a yellow open wagon and a red closed van ‚Äî and a circle of blue track. The model of Percy was a fair likeness of the pictures in the books and was about the size of an O gauge engine. The box featured special artwork by Peter Edwards and included the title, \\"Percy the Small Engine, brought to life by Meccano\\". The plastic track was advertised as: \\"Gauge O track that clicks together and includes Brake Rail for automatic braking. Rails specially designed to make it easy to put train on the track.\\" In practice, although it was advertised as 'Gauge O', this only indicated the size of the model, since the track design was not compatible with anything else (the models were effectively 'flangeless'). Adverts for the set, which showed the model train 'emerging' from the book Percy the Small Engine, appeared in Meccano Magazine and on the back of the dust-covers for several of The Railway Series books in print at the time. The train set was only produced in 1965, and is now extremely rare. It is notable as the last O Gauge train to be made at Meccano's famous Binns Road factory in Liverpool, where the Hornby tinplate trains were made. Photographs of the set and the adverts may be found here and a close-up of Percy may be found here. ===Ertl Company=== Ertl was the first company to manufacture Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends characters and sets from 1985 in the UK and from 1989 in the US. Production ceased for the US market in 2002, and for the UK market in 2005 after RC2 Corporation acquired Ertl and discontinued the ranges to avoid conflict with the then existing Thomas license held by Learning Curve Brands, which produced the similar Take Along Thomas & Friends system. Die-cast range The most notable of the Ertl Company's Thomas ranges was a line of die-cast models and playsets. The range was very popular in the UK, and the nature of the subject matter encouraged collecting. Thomas, Henry, and James were the first models to be released. The original Thomas featured a decal sticker sheet which allowed him to have different expressions. Percy, Toby, Annie and Clarabel, and Bertie followed in late 1985, with updated versions of Thomas, Henry, and James with red buffer beams to replace the older white ones. Edward and Gordon came out in 1988. In 1990, characters were updated with fixed plastic faces as the \\"sticker-face\\" models were prone to losing their faces. New vehicles were produced on a near- yearly basis, such as recently introduced characters to tie-in with their Television series appearance, as well as characters who had only appeared in The Railway Series books. In later years, special vehicles were created, such as metallic variants of engines, a Gold Thomas to celebrate the 50th Anniversary of The Railway Series, and a Millennium Silver Thomas in 2000. The vehicles first used pin hook couplings to couple up and create trains. Locomotives had a moulded coupling 'eye' at each end, while rolling stock had one 'hook' coupling and one 'eye' coupling on the other end. In 2002, the vehicles were updated to use U-hook couplings, with less 'give', but they were more prone to breakage. The majority of locomotive models and some road vehicles had a diecast metal body with a moulded plastic chassis and plastic wheels. The bodies were fully painted and lined. They were free-wheeling although the chassis was rigid (locomotives were not fitted with separate bogies), and a steam locomotive's tender was part of the same moulding as its body. Models of coaches and trucks were assembled from self-coloured plastic mouldings, with some surface detail (such as coach sides) being applied using self-adhesive labels. Sets and destinations were produced for the vehicles. The original playsets composed of playmats with illustrations of scenery and rails and moulded destinations. Later sets consisted of a grey connectable track system, with additional add-on destinations and pieces of track included with engines. The track system was updated in 2002 with detailed rail stickers and a green border. The Ertl die-cast range was discontinued in the United States in 2002. It was effectively replaced by Learning Curve's Take-Along range. Thomas Mini World Miniatures was a Thomas line released in 1991. It featured main characters with sticker faces which were previously used in the die-cast range. Included with the character was a connectable block base in the form of a destination, such as a turntable, windmill, level crossing, or viaduct, made from plastic components to insert into the base, and an indented track section which requires adhesive stickers to be placed. The destinations can be connected to form a playset. Characters were also sold individually, and in multi-packs of three. The range was discontinued in 1992. The engines were later re-released as Keyrings. In 2004, the line was re- released as Thomas Mini World. The characters were updated with moulded faces, and the bases were updated to a style similar to LEGO where the track pieces and buildings can be placed in different positions. Gold Rail Series Gold Rail Series was a Thomas line released in 1993. The products were from the Thomas Engine Collection Series made in Japan by Bandai. The vehicles have magnetic couplings which can connect to other vehicles using a connected switch. The playsets have a moulded section for track with self-adhesive labels for detail, have ramps on the edges for the engines to exit the destination, and feature detailed trackside accessories. Large versions Large Motorized versions of Thomas and Percy were released in 1985. These used the same designs as the die-cast versions, and can move when pulled back. A Remote Control Thomas and a Personalized Money Box was also released in 1985, similar in design to the Motorized version. Wind-Up versions A range called Pull Back and Go! featuring pullback versions of Thomas, Percy, Toby, and Bertie were released under Shining Time Station. A large wind-up Sir Topham Hatt was also produced, and later a Wind-Up series with Thomas, Percy, James, Henry, Bill, Ben, and Bertie. Collector Cards Sets containing eight collector cards of vehicles were made from 1996 to 1999, similar to the existing cards on the packaging design from those corresponding years which could be cut out. ===Merit=== Merit produced several push-along toys to tie-in with the TV series. These included a sit-on Thomas built for toddlers which had a black handle on the rear which enabled it to be pushed along by the parent, large push along versions using hook couplings of Thomas, Annie, and Clarabel and Percy with Troublesome Trucks, a small push along version of Thomas, Annie, and Clarabel using stronger pivot couplings, a Thomas toy with shaped holes and a set of blocks which could be inserted into the correct holes on the Thomas, and some larger scale battery-operated toys. ===Hornby Railways=== In 1985, Hornby Railways produced a series of 00 gauge model engines, track, accessories, and sets, based on Thomas & Friends, designed to be compatible with other Hornby trains, thus allowing an easy migration to more prototypical modelling. The range mainly utilised modified versions of existing Hornby engines, rolling stock and lineside accessories. Over the following years, the range expanded to include some of the main characters and rolling stock as well as train sets. During the 1990s, very few new products were made, and some vehicles discontinued. Some characters were gradually reintroduced towards the end of the decade, and more new items including major and minor characters were released from 2000. New sets were also made using a themed radio control operating system and a Trak-Mat system that sets in Hornby's existing lines used, were customers are encouraged to buy additional track packs, scenery packs, and other scenic materials to create the full printed layout. In 2005, the range revamped due to the 60th Anniversary of The Railway Series and two characters only seen in the book series were introduced, Flying Scotsman and Bear. Several pieces of rolling stock, most seen in Season 8 were also introduced, including a circus series with a total of twelve wagons, as well as three tents and stalls. The sets were redesigned using the regular analogue controllers, and a range of resin buildings seen in the television series designed for adult collectors were introduced. New items were introduced during the next three years to tie in with recent seasons of the television series and the special, The Great Discovery. In 2008 and 2009, new sets were made with the updated Midi-Mat system, replacing the Trak-Mat. From 2010, more items were again discontinuing due to their poor sales. The range was retired in 2014, but was relaunched in December 2015, albeit with only Thomas, Edward, Henry, Gordon, James, and Percy as locos, and limited rolling stock consisting of Troublesome Trucks, Annie and Clarabel, freight wagons, and James and Gordon's coaches. The other parts of the range were not reintroduced due to declining sales. The models are designed for somewhat older children than most Thomas toys, as placing them correctly on the rails requires a certain degree of dexterity, and the plastic-bodied rolling stock may break if dropped. However, the level of detail is more basic than the 'real' models produced by the company, with the result that the trains can be handled safely by inexperienced hands without fear of damaging delicate parts. Other products made by Hornby apart from the OO scale range was a range of clockwork 'Playtrains'. The range first featured Thomas and Percy in sets using 00 track. A new range was then released featuring Thomas, Percy, Toby, Bill and Ben, Annie and Clarabel, and Troublesome Trucks, which ran on red track. The track system also used a playmat similar to a Trak-Mat where additional track and buildings could be placed on the mat illustrations. A battery-powered set featuring Thomas, Annie, Clarabel and Bertie the Bus was also released, which allowed a story recreation of Thomas and Bertie's race. Thomas was unpowered, being pushed along by a motor in Annie. ===Fisher-Price=== Thomas & Friends Wood Thomas & Friends Wood, formerly called Thomas & Friends Wooden Railway (known to many fans as Thomas Wooden Railway) is a wooden railway system designed and created by Learning Curve. It is one of two Wooden Railway lines that feature the characters from Thomas & Friends. The other is BRIO. However, this is the only line to feature characters from The Railway Series. In 1992, Learning Curve created the line with the help of Roy Wilson. In February 1993, the line was first released during American International Toy Fair. One of the first sets for the line was the 22 piece starter set. This set and many of the earlier sets had generic track until 1995, which is the year that Learning Curve patented the \\"Clicketyclack\\" track design. The models at this time were made from painted wood, with plastic being added for the wheels and faces. Metal was used for the magnets and axles. These models got upgraded. The wooden smokeboxes were replaced with plastic smokeboxes. These also include more realistic funnels. These models would not last long, because they got revamped again in 2002. These models had more detailed, newer faces. The battery-powered line of characters were first released in the 1990s. The second version of these models got released in the 2000s. Learning Curve created new track in the 2000s, so that this line of characters could use the track. Like many other brands, Learning Curve faced a recall around the time of the economic downturn. The models involved in this recall had red or yellow paint, and were sold between January 2005 and June 2007. Tests with these models indicated there was the presence of lead. Hence, there was a risk of lead poisoning. Learning Curve was also responsible for the creation of the Talking Railway Series in 2008. This series of engines and destinations could interact with each other through gold magnets found on the engines. In 2009, this line was affected by the takeover of the Thomas franchise by Mattel's preschool division Fisher Price. Now, this line was creating the new characters from the CGI series, and re-releases of the originals with CGI faces. Learning Curve (RC2) got acquired by TOMY, who continued making the line until they gave up the rights to Fisher Price. In 2013, Fisher Price acquired the Thomas Wooden Railway line from TOMY. The models from TOMY would continue to be made although over time these models began to evolve. They introduced rounder corners to the models, so that children would not injure themselves. In 2017, the line went through a complete overhaul under the name Thomas Wood. The engines were made smaller to cut production costs, and the track system was rendered incompatible with the standard wooden track design. For a brief time the toys were half-painted, leaving exposed wood in many sections, again to cut production costs. After backlash by consumers and fans, Fisher Price resumed fully painting the engines in 2019. Take-n-Play Thomas & Friends Take-n-Play Thomas & Friends (formerly Take Along Thomas & Friends) is a series of die-cast 'Thomas' models made by Learning Curve and designed for preschool children. The models have superseded the Ertl die-cast models range, which has now been discontinued. The two ranges are incompatible as the new models use special 'two-way' magnets instead of the hook-and-loop couplers provided on the Ertl models. First released at the start of 2002, the models are generally much chunkier, and considerably less accurate, than the Ertl range. Many items in the Ertl range were passable as 'scale' models of the TV Series characters, but the Take Along products are much more obviously toys. The range includes all the major and minor characters from the TV series and Movies, plus Mike, Culdee, and D199 from The Railway Series. The rolling stock models include many of the 'special' (non-speaking) trucks that have featured in single episodes, and the vehicles include the members of The Pack. As well as the individual characters, a number of play-sets have been produced, either containing two or more characters, or a single engine with play scene and DVD. Some specials have been produced with a metallic finish, and a few models are fitted with sound chips and lights. In 2006, two playsets called Train Yard Set and Working Hard Set were introduced. These were\`much bigger than other playsets, being more than 1√ó1 metres. Original sets were less than 30√ó30 centimetres. In 2010, Take-Along was bought by Mattel and became a Fisher-Price line and renamed Take-n-Play. New characters were released and the old models were re-released with upgraded paints and faces. In 2013, the production of the Take-n-Play models was relocated to Thailand (whereas all prior models were manufactured in China, as were the Ertl range models). Coinciding with the move, further changes were made to the models, including redesigned wheels, updated faces that more closely resemble those of the CGI series rather than the model series, and other additional changes. In 2017, Mattel retooled the line into Thomas Adventures. There are characters from Journey Beyond Sodor and other recent Thomas movies in this line as well as the models recycled from Take-n-Play. Some of these are just the Collectable Railway models repackaged. All of these models have hook couplings similar to Mattel's own trains that they made for Hot Wheels and Matchbox. The line was discontinued in December 2018 and was retooled to work with the TrackMaster range. Thomas TrackMaster In 2007, HIT Entertainment's subsidiary HIT Toy Company picked up the license to produce the Thomas Motor Road and Rail range. The TrackMaster engines were compatible with Tomy's Motor Road and Rail merchandise. TrackMaster's light brown coloured track was easily connected to the previous blue track from TOMY by track adapters, which were included in every set until new releases after 2008. An innovation in this range was special editions of certain engines, including remote-controlled and face changing variations. In 2010, the rights were put under the ownership of Fisher Price. In 2014, Mattel decided to take TrackMaster and completely reinvent it. The trains from this range would now be faster and be able to go up tall hills. This range also saw the track made more realistic. The coaches and rolling stock didn't receive that treatment - they were made smaller so that the engines could go up hills without struggling because of big rolling stock. ==Thomas Motorized== Motorized is a battery-operated toy system manufactured by Fisher-Price, Mattel in the US and was launched in 2020. It is a rebrand of the 2014 TrackMaster line and is virtually identical to it, although with new products being released alongside re-released older ones and an aim to be more simplistic with packaging and sets similar to the previous line before it. ===Tomy=== Tomy have made several ranges of 'Thomas' models. This line was later reworked into Plarail, a Japanese version of Tomy. Tomy did many models, the most odd choice was Oliver only being released in UK-JPN but not in the US. Thomas had many variations, including a talking variant. You can tell the engines apart from Trackmaster because early Trackmaster has grey Traction Tyres, while Tomy has peach-coloured. Tomy got cancelled when Hit toy company took over in 2007. Thomas Motor Road and Rail See Thomas Motor Road & Rail below. Capsule Plarail In 1997, Tomy made a range of wind-up models that 'have an action when you wind them up'. The range was small and included only a few of the 'major' characters. In 2006, another range was introduced. More characters were modelled than previously, and some had moving side rods. Additional models from the range were released in Japan. Tomix From 1998 onwards, a significant range from Tomix has been introduced providing an electric N gauge Thomas system which was still unique in 2007 and which then included 4 locomotives: Thomas, Percy, James and Henry. Some of the rolling stock looked similar to Graham Farish items. Traction Tyres (Tomy and Trackmaster) Tomy and Plarail have Peach-Coloured Traction Tyres, While Trackmaster has Grey-Coloured Traction Tyres. ===Golden Bear=== My First Thomas & Friends My First Thomas & Friends is a range of chunky plastic toys, produced by British toy company: Golden Bear Toys. The range started in 1994, and was advertised for young infants who enjoyed the series. The models were safe for younger fans to play with. The range started with only a dozen or so models, and has now grown to around 40‚Äì45, the range was (for a short-lived amount of time) available in America, under the company Tomy. The toys are still available in many good retail toy shops all around the UK, and despite speculation that perhaps the range has discontinued, after the absence of three years without new products; brand new models have started to appear on Amazon. The range included most of the major and minor characters from the TV Series. This brand name was used in the Oscar-winning short film Logorama. ;Talking My First Thomas & Friends The talking versions of the My First models were first released in the year 2000. The models are more complex than the basic ones, their eyes move, and they speak familiar phrases from the original stock narrations of Ringo Starr and Michael Angelis. ===Bandai=== Thomas Engine Collection Series A large number of die-cast vehicles released resembled the \\"Gold Rail\\" models made by Ertl. However, this series had more characters, although none from The Railway Series. Most characters from Seasons 1‚Äì5 were made. The last new model, to date, is Jack the Frontloader. There have been 4 sets made for this range. Other than this Bandai had made small plastic toys (as big as an index finger) labelled \\"Pocket Thomas.\\" There is another series where plastic models (as big as the die-casts) are sold mostly at convenience stores along with candy such as mints and feature more minor characters such as the Mailvan. ===Bachmann Industries=== In 2002, Bachmann USA made their own HO-scale electric Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends range for the US and Canada markets. The models are made with new body tools, to resemble the characters in the TV series. So far over two dozen models have been produced, along with character-themed train sets. Unlike Hornby's products, Bachmann's models have moving eyes. In January 2009, Bachmann announced that, in an agreement with HiT Entertainment, a line of large scale Thomas electric trains will be produced, under the title \\"Large Scale Thomas & Friends\\". In 2015, Bachmann announced a line of Narrow Gauge HOn30 Scale trains. In February 2019, Bachmann announced that, they will introduce a brand new N Scale Thomas & Friends range, similar to the Tomix N Scale Thomas & Friends already sold in Japan. ===Marklin=== M√§rklin, a German model train maker, released a limited range of Thomas & Friends merchandise in HO scale. Because of copyright reasons (using Hornby's toolings), they were only available in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, but they did leak out to other countries. They are designed for young children as they have metal frames and plastic shells. They are compatible with the rest of the M√§rklin range, but are extremely basic and have no extra features. They were only released in 2006. ===LEGO=== In 2005, LEGO introduced the first sets in their Duplo 'Thomas' series. Four sets were made, featuring: James the Red Engine, Thomas the Tank Engine, a Troublesome Truck, Toby the Tram Engine, and Percy the Small Engine. Subsequently, in line with usual Lego practice, new sets had been released each year, featuring different scenes and characters, until Mega Bloks picked up the license in 2010 and have produced Thomas sets of their own. Duplo is designed for very young children, so the sets have relatively few pieces (between 7 and 62) to assemble. ===MV Sports=== In 2006, MV Sports made their own self-assembly Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends engines and buildings. The range consists of the following models: *Thomas, Toby and Mavis Three Pack Set *Percy Track Set *James and Station Set *Edward and Engine Shed Set ===Mega Bloks=== In 2009, Mega Bloks made buildable Thomas & Friends models such as Percy, Thomas and Diesel and sets too. This line was ended in 2017. In 2017, Mega Bloks made larger versions of Diesel, Thomas Percy, James and a few others in their attempt of \\"preschoolizing\\" the toys. They made new sets to go along with these. ==Video games== A number of different educational software packages and video games, all based on a 'Thomas' theme, have been released for a variety of different computer platforms. * Thomas the Tank Engine, or Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends, is a 1990 video game published by Alternative Software for many computers.

The story revolves around Hideaki Eda, who is enjoying a life in the country somewhere in Japan. His childhood friend moves from the city he used to live in to where he lives now and starts attending his school. She adapts to a rural life quickly and soon things start to become noisier as Hideaki begins to hang out with more girls from his school. Other versions of the game followed, which were playable as a DVD TV game, and on FOMA mobile phones. The Windows version has been updated several times, ending with version 1.10 on September 29, 2006. Three light novels based on Orange Pocket were released between October 2003 and April 2004 written by J≈çji Kamio. ==Gameplay== The gameplay requires little interaction from the player as most of the duration of the game is spent on simply reading the text that will appear on the screen; this text represents either dialogue between the various characters, or the inner thoughts of the protagonist. Every so often, the player will come to a \\"decision point\\" where he or she is given the chance to choose from options that are displayed on the screen, typically two to three at a time. During these times, gameplay pauses until a choice is made that furthers the plot in a specific direction, depending on which choice the player makes. There are ten main plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience, one for each of the heroines in the story. Eight heroines are from the original game, and the last two come from the console versions, though both versions only get one of those two heroines; therefore, there are nine heroines in the Dreamcast and PlayStation 2 versions. In order to view the plot lines to their entirety, the player will have to replay the game multiple times and choose different choices during the decision points in order to further the plot in an alternate direction. ==Plot== Orange Pocket's story takes place in a rural area in Japan near a large mountain and river. The protagonist, Hideaki Eda, is attending and is experiencing an enjoyable life. One day, Hideaki's childhood friend Nazuna Ayase returns from the city and starts attending his school. She adapts to a rural life quickly and soon things start to become noisier as Hideaki begins to hang out with more girls from his school. ==CharactersMain characters=== ; :Hideaki is the protagonist of the story, and is the person the player assumes. As a child, he lived in the city, which is where he met Nazuna Ayase. His parents were transferred due to their jobs, and he had to leave the city for a rural area. Soon after moving, he becomes close friends with Kazan, Madoka, Eru, and Sakino. After moving, Hideaki became very carefree due to his new friends and the laid-back nature of the town. ; :Voiced by: Minami Hokuto :Nazuna is a childhood friend of Hideaki and at the beginning of the story transfers schools and comes to attend the same school as him. Her appearance, since she grew up in the city, gives her a contrast to those who grew up in the rural area where the story takes place, but she is very sociable and cheerful. After meeting Hideaki's circle of friends for the first time, she easily is able to blend in with them and gets along smoothly. She has excellent reflexes and always gets above-average grades in school. ; : :Minori is in a grade below Hideaki, and is a close friend to Eru Kurosaki. She is very gentle and quiet, liking to do things at her own pace. She has the special skill to go to sleep anywhere, so she always carries around her favorite pillow. She often rests after school in the school library. Despite her small build, she has the largest breasts of any of the heroines in the game. ; : :Madoka is Hideaki's friend, and is one of his classmates. She has a bright, active personality, and is able to set the mood wherever she goes. She is an only child and is very well known around the area where she lives. She has good reflexes, but does not do very well in academic studies. While Madoka appears at ease on the outside, internally she has various insecurities and is unhappy. She is childhood friends with Sakino, and is very close with her. ; : :Eru is in a grade below Hideaki, and acts like his younger sister. Whenever his parents are not home, Eru, who lives in the same neighborhood, comes over to perform domestic chores like cooking and cleaning. She has an obedient and generally quiet personality, but likes to joke with her friends. She is close friends with Minori Nanao, who is the same age as her. ; : :Sakino is Hideaki's friend, and another ones of his classmates. She is childhood friends with Madoka, and is very close with her. She has a serious personality, wears glasses, and constantly tries to get Madoka to settle down and do her work. Sakino dislikes physical exercise, unlike Madoka. She sometimes is a shy person, but is able to become more sociable, though still generally dislikes speaking to others. This gives her a gloomy appearance, but she is just constantly thinking about things. ; : :Kiriko is one of Hideaki's classmates, though she does not appear in the beginning of the story. This is due to her liking to be alone and thus gives her a cool type of personality. She does have some friends at school, but she is basically alone most of the time. Kiriko enjoys photography, and often carries around her camera. Her grandfather owns a watch store which she lives above and works at as a part time job. ; : :Haya is an upperclassman at Hideaki's school. She has a short build which is in contrast to her otherwise strong personality, though she has been known to act timidly at times. She is actually very lonely, and she acts childishly. Haya is a typical tsundere character. ; : :Y≈´ki is a younger girl living next door to Hideaki. She often refers to Hideaki as . ; : :Arika is another upperclassman at Hideaki's school. She is a close friend of Haya's, and is a serious, level-headed type of person. Arika looks after both Haya and Hideaki as an older-sister would. She hides the fact that she plays the guitar, likes to sing songs as she plays, and wants to become a professional musician. She was a minor character in the original game, but was given a scenario in the PlayStation 2 version. ; : :Korune is in a grade below Hideaki. Her parents own a bakery in town. She generally has a cheerful personality, though when around men she will act like she is in a hurry and will attempt to run away quickly. She only makes an appearance in the Dreamcast version of the game. ===Supporting characters=== ; : :Kazan is Hideaki's best male friend. He comes from an old family, and is an only child. He has an honest and diligent personality and will always show courtesy to others. He had respect for his grandfather while he was still alive; he was a martial arts master. His grandfather had taught him this skill, which gave him a roughneck label at one point. After Hideaki initially moved, Kazan and him were at odds with each other, but gradually they became good friends. Hiiragi Tachibana is his fianc√©, and he loves her dearly. ; : :Hiiragi is one of Hideaki's friends, and is Kazan's future wife-to-be. Like Kazan, she too comes from an old family and has adopted an older way of thinking about the world. She takes great pride that she is Kazan's fianc√©, and does not hesitate to profess this fact. She is generally gentle and quiet, but she too has learned the same martial arts style as Kazan, and it is hinted at that she is better than he is at the art. ; : :Tomika is a young teacher at the school Hideaki attends, and is his homeroom teacher. She has a bright personality and will always help her students with problems. She is popular with the students, who will often refer to her as \\"Tomika-chan\\" as a term of endearment. ; :Sh≈çzan was Kazan's late grandfather. He was the head of Kazan's family, and was a martial arts master, along with being intellectual. He had a great influence on Kazan's character as he grew up. In his last years of life, he wrote a novel under the pen name . ==DevelopmentRelease history=== Orange Pocket was first introduced in Japan on June 13, 2003 as a CD-ROM playable on a Microsoft Windows PC.

In 1959, he won the Nobel Prize in Literature \\"for his lyrical poetry, which with classical fire expresses the tragic experience of life in our own times\\". Along with Giuseppe Ungaretti and Eugenio Montale, he was one of the foremost Italian poets of the 20th century. == Biography == Quasimodo was born in Modica, Sicily, to Gaetano Quasimodo and Clotilde Ragusa. He spent his childhood in Roccalumera. In 1908 his family moved to Messina, as his father had been sent there to help the local population struck by a devastating earthquake. The impressions of the effects of natural forces would have a great impact on the young Quasimodo. In 1919 he graduated from the local Technical College. In Messina he also made friends with Giorgio La Pira, future mayor of Florence. Salvatore Quasimodo was introduced to the Scottish Rite Freemasonry. by his father, who was a member of the Masonic Lodge ‚ÄúArnaldo da Brescia‚Äù. The Grand Orient of Italy has recognized Quasimodo as one of his most notable brothers. In 1917 Quasimodo founded the short-lived Nuovo giornale letterario (\\"New Literary Journal\\"), in which he published his first poems. In 1919 he moved to Rome to finish his engineering studies, but poor economic conditions forced him to find a work as a technical draughtsman. In the meantime he collaborated with several reviews and studied Greek and Latin. In 1929, invited by Elio Vittorini, who had married Quasimodo's sister, he moved to Florence. Here he met poets such as Alessandro Bonsanti and Eugenio Montale. In 1930 he took a job with Italy's Civil Engineering Corps in Reggio Calabria. Here he met the Misefari brothers, who encouraged him to continue writing. Developing his nearness to the hermetic movement, Quasimodo published his first collection, Acque e terre (\\"Waters and Earths\\") in that year. In 1931 he was transferred to Imperia and then to Genoa, where he got acquainted with Camillo Sbarbaro and other personalities of the Circoli magazine, with which Quasimodo started a fruitful collaboration. In 1932 he published with them a new collection, Oboe sommerso, including all his lyrics from 1930‚Äì1932. In 1934 Quasimodo moved to Milan. Starting from 1938 he devoted himself entirely to writing, working with Cesare Zavattini and for Letteratura, the official review of the Hermetic movement. In 1938 he published Poesie, followed by the translations of Lirici Greci (\\"Greek Poets\\") published by Corrente di Vita in 1939. Though an outspoken anti-Fascist, during World War II Quasimodo did not take part in the Italian resistance against the German occupation. In that period he devoted himself to the translation of the Gospel of John, of some of Catullus's cantos, and several episodes of the Odyssey. In 1945 he became a member of the Italian Communist Party. In 1946 he published another collection, Giorno dopo giorno (\\"Day After Day\\"), which made clear the increasing moral engagement and the epic tone of the social criticism of the author. The same theme characterized his next works, La vita non √® sogno (\\"Life Is Not a Dream\\"), Il falso e il vero verde (\\"The False and True Green\\") and La terra impareggiabile (\\"The Incomparable Land\\"). In all this period Quasimodo did not stop producing translations of classic authors and collaborating as a journalist for some of the most prestigious Italian publications (mostly with articles about the theatre). In the 1950s Quasimodo won the following literary awards: Premio San Babila (1950), Premio Etna-Taormina (1953), Premio Viareggio (1958) and, finally, the Nobel Prize for Literature (1959). In 1960 and 1967 he received honoris causa degrees from the Universities of Messina and Oxford, respectively. Quasimodo's grave at the Cimitero Monumentale in Milan in 2015 In his last years the poet made numerous voyages to Europe and America, giving public speeches and public lectures of his poems, which had been translated in several foreign languages. In June 1968, when he was in Amalfi for a discourse, Quasimodo was struck by a cerebral hemorrhage. He died a few days later in the hospital in Naples. He was interred in the Cimitero Monumentale in Milan. == Poetic language == Traditional literary critique divides Quasimodo's work into two major periods: the hermetic period until World War II and the post-hermetic era until his death. Although these periods are distinct, they are to be seen as a single poetical quest. This quest or exploration for a unique language took him through various stages and various modalities of expression. As an intelligent and clever poet, Quasimodo used a hermetical, \\"closed\\" language to sketch recurring motifs like Sicily, religion and death. Subsequently, the translation of authors from Roman and Greek Antiquity enabled him to extend his linguistic toolkit. The disgust and sense of absurdity of World War II also had its impact on the poet's language. This bitterness, however, faded in his late writings, and was replaced by the mature voice of an old poet reflecting upon his world. == References == == External links == * Salvatore Quasimodo ‚Äì Parco letterario Salvatore Quasimodo * Salvatore Quasimodo ‚Äì Official website * including the Nobel lecture on December 11, 1959 \\"The Poet and the Politician\\" * Strada di Agrigento in English translation * Salvatore Quasimodo poems * Salvatore Quasimodo and Agrigento * Salvatore Quasimodo reading his poems in Italian at the Library of Congress, Apr. 22, 1960 - Category:1901 births Category:1968 deaths Category:People from the Province of Ragusa Category:People from Gela Category:Italian male poets Category:Italian literary critics Category:Italian translators Category:Sicilian writers Category:Nobel laureates in Literature Category:Communist writers Category:Communist poets Category:Italian communists Category:Italian Nobel laureates Category:Milan Conservatory faculty Category:Italian Communist Party politicians Category:20th-century Italian politicians Category:Burials at the Cimitero Monumentale di Milano Category:20th-century translators Category:20th-century Italian poets Category:Italian Freemasons ","title":"Salvatore Quasimodo"},{"id":"9110751","text":"Riky≈´ may refer to: * Sen no Riky≈´, the 16th century Japanese master of the tea ceremony * Rikyu (film), the 1989 Hiroshi Teshigahara film about the later years of Sen no Riky≈´'s life * Riky≈´ crater, on Mercury ","title":"Riky≈´"},{"id":"9110768","text":"Alice Parker (born December 16, 1925) is an internationally renowned American composer, arranger, conductor, and teacher.

He explained that he had done more than one hundred flights with this machine under the cover of darkness. Tillinghast stated that he began flying under cover of darkness two months prior to his announcement, his first flight being between Worcester, Massachusetts, and New York City, New York, a distance of approximately 300 miles, where Tillinghast and his crew claimed to have circled the Statue of Liberty at 4,000 feet. At one point, the engines were said to have shut off, and the contraption glided through the air for forty- eight minutes while the mechanics made repairs. After which, they made their way back to Worcester, by way of a route taking them through Boston. ==Sightings== Between December 12, 1909, and February 1910, New England newspapers were filled with \\"sightings\\" of the aircraft purportedly designed by Tillinghast and two unnamed mechanics.Whalen, S. & Bartholomew, R. E. (September 2002), \\"The Great New England Airship Hoax of 1909\\". The New England Quarterly, 75(3), p.466.

The author H. P. Lovecraft witnessed a mass sighting of Tillinghast in Providence, Rhode Island on December 24, 1909. While the crowds of people on the street believed they were viewing Tillinghast's airship, Lovecraft identified the object as the planet Venus.H. P. Lovecraft, ed. S. T. Joshi, Collected Essays, Volume 3: Science (New York City: Hippocampus Press, 2005), pp. 99-100 Tillinghast never offered his craft for public viewing or inspection, and the media grew more skeptical, explaining the sightings were most likely Venus or fire balloons. ==References== ==Sources== *Whalen, Stephen and Robert E.

The service's chief fire officer is Neil Odin.Statutory FRS/area covered ==History== Until the Second World War, local towns had their own fire services. In 1941, these were combined into the National Fire Service. The Fire Services Act 1947 disbanded the National Fire Service and created county- level fire services. Hampshire Fire Brigade was formed on 4 April 1948. Many meetings and discussions were held prior to the service's creation in 1948 by the Hampshire fire service committees, to discuss who would be appointed the role of chief fire officer and how the service would be structured. With ongoing expansion, the service was under increasing pressure to open a service HQ. The FRS was originally hoping to use and acquire North Hill House in Winchester for usage as the headquarters ‚Äì a building still desired by the Admiralty at the time and therefore the service was not allowed to buy it. In May 1948; the admiralty gave up the premises and allowed the service to operate it. However twenty years later in 1968, the service HQ moved to a floor of Ashburton Court, The Castle, Winchester as well as the control room. In 1974, the service absorbed the Southampton and Portsmouth fire services and changed its name to Hampshire Fire Service. In 1997, responsibility for the service was transferred from Hampshire County Council to the newly formed Hampshire Fire and Rescue Authority. Following the Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004, the service changed its name to Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service. HFRS are now headquartered in Eastleigh. Since late 2015, it has shared its headquarters with Hampshire Constabulary.http://www.hantsfire.gov.uk/incidents-news-and- events/news/2015/police-begin-groundbreaking-move-to-fire-headquarters/ == Fire Stations/Appliances == { class= - valign=bottom !

Currently, 21 areas have been identified as having a greater need for ambulance cover. Annually, the service attends over 13,000 medical emergencies supporting the ambulance service. The aim of a co-responder is to preserve life until the arrival of either a Rapid Response Vehicle (RRV) or an ambulance. Co-Responder Vehicles are single manned by a specially trained firefighter, who will take the vehicle to his or her workplace/home and will respond from there when alerted to an incident via pager. Each vehicle is equipped with: * Defibrillator * Bag and mask resuscitator * Oxygen * Airways * Suction units * Standard first aid equipment * Entonox (analgesic gas) In addition to co-responding, the service has also rolled out the Immediate Emergency Care (IEC) program which has resulted in all front line fire appliances being equipped with more advanced medical equipment. This includes a defibrillator, Entonox and patient monitoring equipment. As of October 2016, all appliances and front line crews had received the IEC training and equipment. == Operations  Firefighting cover === HFRS provides fire cover according to a system of four risk categories which have traditionally been used across the UK, where every building is rated for its risk on a scale from 'A' down to 'D'. The risk category determines the minimum number of appliances to be sent in a pre- determined attendance (PDA). Category 'A' includes areas with a high density of large buildings, specific high risk sites, and/or population, such as docklands, ports, oil refineries, fuel storage facilities, hospitals, prisons, and some commercial and industrial complexes and factories. Two fire engines are to arrive within five minutes, and a third within eight minutes. An aerial high-reach appliance is also sent on many 'A' risk PDAs. Category 'B' areas have a medium density of large buildings and/or population, such as multi- storey residential blocks, shops and factories, and will generally be classified as 'B' risk. Two fire engines will be deployed, with the first to arrive within five minutes and the second within eight minutes. Category 'C' covers lower density, suburban areas and detached properties usually found in smaller towns and villages. One fire engine should arrive at a 'C' risk incident within ten minutes, and a second within twenty minutes. Category 'D' covers more rural areas not covered by the first three categories. One fire engine should arrive at 'D' risk incidents within 20 minutes, with any further assistance available on-request by the on-scene officer in charge. HFRS also has fire cover for the ports of Southampton and Portsmouth, including HMNB Portsmouth, and the airports of Southampton and Farnbrough.  Mutual assistance  The Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004 gives the UK fire services the ability to call upon other services or fire authorities in what is known as mutual assistance.Fire and Rescue Act 2004 Hampshire Fire and Rescue gives mutual aid to the following services: * Dorset & Wiltshire Fire and Rescue Service * Surrey Fire and Rescue Service * Royal Berkshire Fire and Rescue Service * West Sussex Fire and Rescue Service * Isle of Wight Fire and Rescue Service HFRS also mobilises to support airport firefighters at Southampton Airport and Farnbrough Airport. === Control === HFRS have their own control, stationed in the HQ, they mobilise appliances for Hampshire and Isle of wight. The service uses Networked Fire Services Partnership, so if need be, in spate conditions, mobilise on behalf of Dorset & Wiltshire and Devon & Somerset FRS, and vice versa. ==Future== In 2015, Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service carried out a risk review to determine how to reduce costs to match a ¬£16m funding gap that would develop by 2020 due to funding cuts.http://www.hantsfire.gov.uk/about-us/a-safer-hampshire/the-challenge/ Following a public consultation in late 2015, the final proposals confirmed that none of the 51 fire stations in Hampshire would close and there would be no compulsory redundancies. Costs would be saved by reducing the number of operational firefighters at stations, including allowing some engines to respond to minor incidents with a smaller crew.http://www.hantsfire.gov.uk/EasySiteWeb/GatewayLink.aspx?alId=8716 The second major change was to introduce smaller engines at some stations. Until 2015, all Hampshire engines were a similar size and design.http://www.hantsfire.gov.uk/EasySiteWeb/GatewayLink.aspx?alId=8716 The changes designated three types of fire engine: Enhanced Capability engines, which are similar in size to a traditional fire engine; Intermediate Capability appliances, which are slightly smaller; and First Response Capability appliances, which are much smaller. in 2019, the service scrapped the idea for first response capability appliance due to weight distribution and performance issues, instead would be getting 49 intermediate capability appliances and 24 enhanced capability appliances. (73 new appliances in total) == 3S Fire == 3S fire is wholly owned by Hampshire Fire and Rescue Authority with 100% of all profits being returned to the Authority to assist with running the Fire and Rescue Service. ==See also== *Fire service in the United Kingdom *Fire engine *Fire apparatus *FiReControl *List of British firefighters killed in the line of duty ==References== ==External links== * Category:Fire and rescue services of England Fire ","title":"Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service"},{"id":"9110821","text":"The Unjust Angel (, translit.

In December 1992, Blissett was acquitted of GBH after challenging for an aerial ball with Torquay United player John Uzzell in an away game at Plainmoor 12 months earlier. It was alleged by Uzzell that Blissett had deliberately elbowed him in the face, fracturing his eye socket, although the court did not agree with this. Blissett has always maintained that the incident was an accidental collision and video evidence of the challenge was deemed to show that Blissett kept his eyes on the ball and, furthermore, that in jumping to head an aerial ball, a player would typically raise one or both arms to gain height. Blissett was a prolific scorer in the lower divisions of English football, scoring 210 league goals in 10 seasons (an average of 21 goals per season) for Crewe and then Brentford before being sold to Wimbledon in the summer of 1993. He had picked up a Third Division title medal with Brentford in 1992. He was a semi-regular player in four seasons at Wimbledon, making 67 FA Premier League appearances and scoring 24 goals. He had a loan spell with Wycombe Wanderers during that time, and also a loan spell back at Crewe, before leaving Wimbledon in 1997 for a brief spell with Sembawang Rangers in Singapore. He then completed his playing career with a four-year spell in Germany playing for SV Elversberg.

At the height of her fame, however, Fedora withdrew to a private island near Corfu and refused to be seen in public, leading to vast speculation on what became of her. All are shocked when it is confirmed that Fedora has committed suicide by throwing herself in front of a train. One of her mourners at her funeral is aging has-been Hollywood producer Barry \\"Dutch\\" Detweiler, who was once Fedora's lover. Dutch recalls visiting Fedora two weeks before her death at her villa near Corfu in order to convince her to come out of retirement for a new screen adaptation of Anna Karenina. Dutch is suspicious when Fedora seems confused, disheveled, and unable to remember details of their love affair. Fedora tells him she is a prisoner on the island, held captive by the elderly Polish Countess Sobryanski, her overprotective servant Miss Balfour, her chauffeur Kritos, and Dr. Vando, who seemingly was responsible for keeping the one-time star looking so young. Dutch attempts to help Fedora flee the island, only to be knocked unconscious by Kritos. He awakens a week later to discover that Fedora has killed herself. Dutch suspects that she might have been murdered by the countess for revealing that she was being held captive. At the funeral, Dutch accuses Vando and the countess of murdering Fedora. The countess reveals that in fact she is Fedora with whom Dutch had the affair. The woman who died was her daughter Antonia, who had taken her mother's place for years after one of Fedora's plastic surgery treatments disfigured her face. Antonia resembled her mother to a shocking degree but was a much better actress, causing people to believe that Fedora herself had become more skillful with age. The deception went undetected until Antonia fell in love with actor Michael York while making a film with him. She begged her mother to be allowed to tell Michael the truth, but the scandal would have ruined both Antonia's career and Fedora's legacy. Unable to trust Antonia, Fedora arranged for Antonia's \\"retirement\\" and kept her prisoner on the island. The loss of both her career and her true love caused her to turn to drugs, which destroyed both her looks and her sanity. Fedora realized that she never could allow her daughter to leave the island because the media frenzy that would accompany \\"Fedora's\\" return would destroy the last of Antonia's fragile mental health. Consumed with guilt over the predicament she had caused, Fedora tended Antonia until Dutch's appearance reminded Antonia of the life she had lost, and she killed herself. Horrified by the revelation, Dutch considers revealing the sordid story to the press, but realizes he still has feelings toward Fedora and decides she has been punished enough by the loss of her career and her guilt over her daughter. Dutch says goodbye to the elderly Fedora, who dies six months after they part. ==Cast== ==Production== Wilder's The Front Page had been released four years earlier, and had been a critical failure. Furthermore, two more recent Hollywood-based films, Gable and Lombard and W.C. Fields and Me (both released in 1976), had failed to engender any interest at the box office. As a result, executives at Universal Pictures were hesitant to offer Wilder his usual deal. Instead, they paid Wilder and Diamond to write the screenplay with the understanding the studio had 45 days following its submission to decide if it wanted to proceed with the project. The studio ultimately put it in turnaround, and Wilder began shopping it to other studios with no success. An infusion of capital from German investors enabled him to proceed with the film.Sikov, Ed, On Sunset Boulevard: The Life and Times of Billy Wilder. New York, New York: Hyperion 1998. , pp. 551‚Äì53 Wilder originally envisioned Marlene Dietrich as Fedora and Faye Dunaway as her daughter Antonia, but Dietrich despised the original book and thought the screenplay was no improvement. Sydney Pollack invited Wilder to a pre-release screening of Bobby Deerfield, in which former fashion model Marthe Keller had a featured role. Wilder decided to cast her as both mother and daughter in Fedora, but the actress had suffered such severe facial nerve injuries in an automobile accident that she was unable to endure wearing the heavy makeup required to transform her into the older character, so he cast Hildegard Knef in the role.Sikov, pp. 553‚Äì54 After viewing a rough cut of the film, Wilder realized to his horror that neither Keller nor Knef could be understood easily, nor did their voices sound very much alike, which was crucial to the film's plot. He hired German actress Inga Bunsch to dub the dialogue of both women for the film's English-language release. Keller eventually recorded the voices for both characters in the French version, and Knef did likewise for the German release.Sikov, pp. 559‚Äì60 Filming took place at the Bavaria Studios in Munich and the Billancourt Studios in Paris with extensive location shooting around Corfu and the smaller island of Madouri. The film's sets were designed by the art director Alexandre Trauner, who had previously worked with Wilder on Kiss Me, Stupid and The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes. Allied Artists dropped its deal to distribute the film after it was screened at a Myasthenia Gravis Foundation benefit in New York City and the audience response was unenthusiastic. The film was picked up by Lorimar Productions, which planned to peddle it to CBS as a television movie. Before the network could agree to the offer, United Artists stepped in. After cutting 12 minutes of the film based on studio recommendations, Wilder previewed the film in Santa Barbara, California. Halfway through it the audience began derisively laughing at all the wrong places. Dejected by the response and despondent from all the problems he had encountered up to this point, the director refused to make any more edits.Sikov, pp. 560‚Äì61 On May 30, 1978, the film had its world premiere at the Cannes Film Festival as part of a retrospective of the director's work.Cannes Film Festival archives Afterward, it was released in only a handful of select American and European markets with little fanfare, prompting an insulted Wilder to claim the studio spent \\"about $625 on a marketing campaign.\\"Sikov, pp. 560‚Äì61 It was later shown as part of the Cannes Classics section of the 2013 Cannes Film Festival. Both Henry Fonda and Michael York make appearances as themselves, although Fonda is only credited as \\"The President of the Academy.\\" In the film, Fonda is the president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences who presents a lifetime achievement award to Fedora, but he never actually served as AMPAS president. Fedora was a re- teaming of Wilder with Holden, who had collaborated on Sunset Boulevard, and like the earlier film, it harshly criticized Hollywood's often shabby treatment of its most prominent talent. However, unlike Sunset Boulevard, what Fedora attacked was Hollywood's youth-oriented culture, not the apparent disposability of perceived has-beens. ==Critical reception== In her review in The New York Times, Janet Maslin called it \\"old-fashioned with a vengeance, a proud, passionate remembrance of the way movies used to be, and a bitter smile at what they have become. It is rich, majestic, very close to ridiculous, and also a little bit mad. It seems exactly what Mr. Wilder wants it to be, perfectly self-contained and filled with the echoes of a lifetime; no one could mistake this for the work of a young man. Indeed, it has the resonance of an epitaph. That, too, seems a part of Mr. Wilder's design...The compactness and symmetry evident in Fedora aren't easily achieved these days without a good deal of self-consciousness. Mr. Wilder achieves them naturally.\\"New York Times review Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times wondered \\"Should you see it? I dunno. If you do, go with a clear mind and a slight grin on your face and a memory for the movies of the 1940s. Accept the dumb parts, and the unsurprising revelations, as part of the film's style instead of as weaknesses. Trust Wilder to know what he's doing, even during the deliberate clich√©s. See it like that, and I bet you'll like it. See it with a straight face, and you'll think it's boring and obvious. Fedora's odd that way: It leaves itself up to the audience.\\"Chicago Sun-Times review TV Guide describes it as \\"defiantly and proudly old-fashioned both in style and content, weaving an (intentionally) campy melodrama about the mysterious suicide of a faded movie queen into a spellbinding meditation on cinema and the price of manufactured illusions...Fedora is a marvelous lesson in classical storytelling and the pleasures to be had from an absorbing narrative. It's almost as if Wilder is bidding adieu to the Golden Age of Hollywood, utilizing opulent sets, elegant crane shots, ultra-slow dissolves, and a flourish of voice-overs and flashbacks-within-flashbacks in a final demonstration of virtuoso scenario construction, only to tear it down at the end and show it was all a lie...The film is not perfect, and would have undoubtedly been better still had Wilder been able to persuade Marlene Dietrich to play the Countess, but it's still a worthy late addition to the work of a master.\\"TV Guide review Time Out London calls it \\"a shamefully underrated film...and one of the most sublime achievements of the '70s...it has a narrative assurance beyond the grasp of most directors nowadays: finely acted, mysterious, witty, moving and magnificent.\\"Time Out London review In his Chicago Reader review, Dave Kehr stated \\"Its spare classical style, its sense of character, and its occasional romantic excesses are all very much Old Hollywood...but the deliberate and sometimes dismaying anachronisms are signs of a deep, unshakable commitment to a personal aesthetic ‚Äì a commitment that is sometimes more moving than anything in the film itself.\\"Chicago Reader review Variety wrote \\"Wilder's directorial flair, the fine production dress, Holden's solid presence and Michael York...and Henry Fonda...add some flavor to this bittersweet bow to the old star system,\\"Variety review and added, \\"Missing are needed hints at Fedora's true star quality, which are not...inherent in Keller's performance or that of Knef...and which mar pic with disbelief.\\"Sikov, p. 562 ==See also== *List of German films of the 1970s ==References== ==External links== * Category:1978 films Category:1978 drama films Category:German drama films Category:French drama films Category:West German films Category:French films Category:Films directed by Billy Wilder Category:Films with screenplays by Billy Wilder Category:Films with screenplays by I.

It was launched from Cincinnati, Ohio, United States, in 1863, running a scheduled route between Cincinnati and Memphis, Tennessee. Its captain was James H. Pepper. In June 1863 the Alice Dean served as a Union troop transport, carrying Federal forces from Memphis to join General Ulysses Grant's siege of Vicksburg.Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper (German language edition), New York, 27 June 1863 In July of that year, Confederate Brigadier General John Hunt Morgan and his cavalry undertook a large scale raid from Tennessee through Kentucky and then across Indiana and Ohio. While crossing the Ohio River into Indiana at Brandenburg, Kentucky, the raiders captured the Alice Dean. Using the Alice Dean as a ferry, Morgan's troops were transported to Morvin's Landing, near Mauckport, Indiana. Morgan's Raiders had already appropriated a small packet named John T. McCombs and used her as a decoy to hail down and capture the Alice Dean. After using the two boats for their purposes, Morgan's men burned the Alice Dean. The McCombs was spared because its owner/captain was a friend of Morgan's second-in-command, Basil W. Duke. The machinery was salvaged in the fall of 1863 and auctioned off to the C.T. Dumont Co. for $4,500. Part of the Alice Dean is on display at the Battle of Corydon battlefield.Riverboat Dave's: Riverboats Starting With A A towboat accident at Leavenworth, Indiana in August 1959 caused the water of the Ohio River to drop five feet, which exposed the hull of the Alice Dean. Local history buff took pieces of wood as plaques to commemorate the raid.Ramage, Jame. Rebel Raider: The Life of General John Hunt Morgan (University Press of Kentucky, 1995) p.257 In 1965 the Heth Civic Club took up a collection and bribed a local contractor to move his crane to the site of the Alice Dean in an attempt to recover the ship. The ship was disturbed and several truck loads of wood were recovered. There is a rare video of the expedition. In 2014, Clarence Merk, a local historian, with the permission from the Navy Heritage and History Command Center, took on the quest of locating and validating the wreck of the Alice Dean near Mauckport, Indiana. Merk applied for a permit from the USACE to determine the exact location and condition of the Alice Dean. Clarence Merk coordinated a training day, May 14, 2014 with the IDNR Conservation officers, with their sidescan sonar unit; Louisville Metro Police Dive Team, to put hands on the vessel for confirmation, and the US Coast Guard to validate the results. On May 14, 2014, Clarence Merk and his team located the Alice Dean, divers put hands on authenticating the Alice Dean. The sonar images show the Alice Dean is intact and submerged in 10 meters of water. Clarence Merk presented his irrefutable research to the US General Services Administration Excess Property Division Treaasure Trove Division and became the DE Facto \\"Requestor of Record\\" of the Alice Dean. As a result of development the GSA Treasure Trove Division created a title for the Alice Dean and at the request of the NHHCC, transferred custody of the Alice Dean to the Navy on August 15, 2015, where it is now protected under the Sunken Military Crafts Act of 1947. The document was Transfer Order #122. Clarence Merk partnered with the Indiana Department of Natural Resources Archaeologists in June 2018 to complete the Nomination to Historic Places. That nomination is waiting on technical details from the proposed Phase 1 Research for submission. Clarence Merk, in July 2018 sent out an RFP for Phase 1 Archaeological Research on the Alice Dean, and has contracted for the Services of Cross International Marine Projects, Pan American Consultants, and Archeologist MIchael Murray. The proposed cost for complete mapping and 3D imaging is approximately $60,000. In August 2018, Clarence Merk submitted a request for non-invasive research to the Department of the Navy and it was approved. A \\"Special Use\\" Permit was issued and will allow 3D mapping to begin when funding is secured. Associated with this affair was \\"Sherman's Ride,\\" in which a self-appointed Paul Revere, Jacob Sherman, mounted a horse and galloped upriver to head off the down-bound Grey Eagle to prevent her from falling into the hands of Morgan. He succeeded.

Victor is hoping to reconcile with his estranged wife. Trabucco takes a room in the Ramona Hotel in Riverside, California, which is located directly across the street from the courthouse where Gambola is to testify. Trabucco plans on killing Gambola using a sniper rifle. Victor has a room connected to Trabucco's room at the hotel. He tries unsuccessfully to hang himself; then Victor climbs onto the ledge outside his window. Trabucco is afraid of the attention from the police stationed around the courthouse, so he agrees to drive Victor to the Institute for Sexual Fulfillment, the nearby clinic where Victor's wife Celia, a researcher for 60 Minutes, is gathering information for a segment on the program. Trabucco tries to kill the irritating Victor, but is unintentionally thwarted during each attempt. At the clinic, Victor discovers Celia is having an affair with the clinic's director Dr. Zuckerbrot, who is worried her husband's suicide will reflect badly on his practice. Celia and Zuckerbrot go to the hotel where the doctor mistakenly injects Trabucco with a tranquilizer intended for Victor.

The script was done in three months. We always took much longer, but the wheels were rolling, and we had to go forward.\\" Two weeks into filming, the director realized, \\"It didn't work to have two comics together. I needed someone serious like Clint Eastwood as the hit man instead of a comedian like Matthau.\\" Veber agreed saying Wilder \\"made the same mistake I made when I wrote the story as a play in Paris. It was not a great success because I did not make the killer tough enough. I changed that when I wrote the film. Lino Ventura played the part as a really hard killer. Billy Wilder cast Matthau in the part and that was a mistake. You cannot be frightened by him. He would have been better off with someone like Charles Bronson.\\" Lemmon on set told a reporter that making the film was \\"a dream ... Not only do Walter and I know what each of us is going to do.

If you don't know where to put the camera, you are a revolutionary nouvelle vague cinematic genius. The only things that seem to do well today are garbage. You pile up cars in a wreck. However, as those pictures are keeping the companies alive and permitting them to subsidize our pictures, I suppose I shouldn't complain. But I complain.\\" Wilder added during filming, \\"This is my 53rd year in the industry and in that time I've seen a lot of ebb and flow - lately there's been an inordinate amount of ebb.

We'd been burned; we chose wrong with Buddy Buddy, and we didn't want to make another mistake.

Calling it \\"slight but irresistible,\\" he observed it \\"doesn't compare with the greatest Wilder-Diamond films, including The Fortune Cookie, which launched Mr. Lemmon and Mr. Matthau as a team, but it is the lightest, breeziest comedy any one of them has been associated with in years.\\" He added, \\"There's something most appealing about the simplicity of the physical production and the small cast. I suspect that one of the reasons Buddy Buddy is so congenial, even when a gag doesn't build to the anticipated boff, is because you never feel intimidated by it. It doesn't attempt to overwhelm you with the kind of gigantic sets, props and crowd scenes that made farces on the order of 1941 and The Blues Brothers so oppressive. Buddy Buddy travels light, unencumbered by expensive special effects, fueled only by the talents of its actors and its director's irrepressible sense of the ridiculous.\\" He said of Lemmon, \\"Not in a long time has [he] been more appealing,\\" and he described Matthau as \\"extremely comic ‚Äì perhaps our best farceur.\\"The New York Times review Far less enthusiastic was Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times, who stated, \\"This movie is appalling. It made me want to rub my eyes. Was it possible that the great Billy Wilder ... could possibly have made a film this bad? Buddy Buddy is very bad. It is a comedy without any laughs. (And, yes, I mean literally that it contains no laughs.) But it is worse than that. It succeeds in reducing two of the most charming actors in American motion picture history to unlikable ciphers. Can you imagine a film that co-stars Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon and yet contains no charm, ebullience, wit, charisma ‚Äì even friendliness? This whole movie is like one of those pathetic Hollywood monsters drained of its life fluids ... Basically, we are invited to watch two drudges meander through a witless, pointless exercise in farce ... Buddy Buddy is incompetent. And that is the saddest word I can think of to describe it.\\"Chicago Sun-Times review Gene Siskel named it as the worst film of 1981 (Roger Ebert hated the film as much as Siskel did, but his pick for the worst film of 1981 was Heaven's Gate). Channel 4 said, \\"Wilder helming the classic comic pairing of Matthau and Lemmon is always going to be difficult to dismiss, but it has to be said that all involved had seen better days at the time this got made ... There's the recognizable chemistry between the two leads, but little else here to recommend. It would be foolish to come to this movie expecting The Odd Couple or The Apartment, but you do expect something a little better than this.\\"Channel 4 review Wilder later reflected, \\"In this Donner Pass expedition known as Hollywood, many fall by the wayside. People eat people. Very few make it. Lately I've been going to more funerals than openings of pictures. Sometimes you have a funeral and an opening on the same day, and you don't feel very good when you see a comedy after you've put somebody to rest or watched the Neptune Society blow his ashes into the Pacific Ocean ... Sometimes I feel the way you feel when you find yourself at a dinner party with an uncongenial group of people and you say, 'I've got a great story, but I'm not going to tell it to them tonight. I'm not interested in entertaining them.' A lot of energy goes into it, and sometimes it doesn't seem as if it's worth the trouble. I've been doing it now for over 50 years.\\" ===Box office=== The film opened in 700 theaters, the same weekend as Rollover, and finished second with a gross of $2,132,221 and went on to gross $7.3 million in the United States and Canada. == See also == * Buddy film ‚Äì a related genre ==References* *Review of film at The New York Times *Buddy Buddy at TCMDB *Article on film at Trailers from Hell Category:1981 films Category:1980s screwball comedy films Category:American buddy comedy films Category:American screwball comedy films Category:American films Category:American remakes of French films Category:Films about contract killing Category:American films based on plays Category:Films directed by Billy Wilder Category:Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer films Category:Films with screenplays by Billy Wilder Category:Films with screenplays by I.

Examples of articulatory gestures are the hand movements necessary to enunciate sign language and the mouth movements of speech. In semiotic terms, they are the physical embodiment (signifiers) of speech signs, which are gestural by nature (see below). The definition of gesture varies greatly, but here it will be taken in its widest sense, namely, any meaningful action. An intentional action is meaningful if it is not strictly utilitarian: for example, sending flowers to a friend is a gesture, because this action is performed not only for the purpose of moving flowers from one place to another, but also to express some sentiment or even a conventional message in the language of flowers. Use of the broadest definition of gesture (not restricted to hand movements) allows Hockett‚Äôs ‚Äúrapid fading‚Äù design feature of human language to be accommodated as a type of sign in semiotic theory. But if an articulatory gesture is to be considered a true gesture in the above sense, it must be meaningful. Therefore, an articulatory gesture must be at least as large as the smallest meaningful unit of language, the morpheme. A morpheme corresponds roughly to a spoken word or a sign language gesture. This definition differs from the practice, common among linguists, of referring to phonemes (meaningless mouth movements) as articulatory gestures (see articulatory phonology). In semiotics, meaningless components of spoken gestures (written as individual letters), or meaningless components of sign language gestures (such as location of hand contact) are known as figurae, the constituents of signs. It also differs from the tradition of considering speech sounds to be the signifiers of speech signs. But this practice confuses signals with symbols. Sound and light are analogue signals, whereas mouth and hand gestures are discrete symbolic entities. A sound or light signal is subject to random noise, whereas the image of the gesture is subject to regular distortion, as when a signer's hand is viewed from different angles. In speech, the sound of the contact of the tongue in the letter T can be distorted by surrounding mouth movements, as in the phrase ‚Äúperfect memory‚Äù. When pronounced at conversational speed, the sound of the tongue contact is completely obscured by surrounding consonants even though this T movement is fully carried out. Articulatory gestures, when seen as the physical embodiment of speech and sign language symbols, provide a link between these two language types, and show how speech resembles sign language more closely than is generally presumed. ==See also== *Language production *Linguistic performance ==References and further reading== * Eccardt, Thomas.

The School offers undergraduate and post-graduate architecture programs. The School of Architecture has approximately 200 undergraduate students and 30 graduate students. The School has a library, which includes a rare book collection dedicated to the history of the study and practice of architecture in the United States. The School of Architecture is the smallest of the six major program divisions of the University (the others being the Mendoza College of Business, the College of Arts and Letters, the College of Engineering, the College of Science, and the Law School). The School of Architecture is located in Walsh Family Hall on the Notre Dame campus. It holds the architecture library, a hall of casts, offices, studios, classrooms, and a gallery. The School teaches (pre-modernist) traditional architecture and urban planning (e.g. following the principles of New Urbanism and New Classical Architecture). It awards the annual Richard H. Driehaus Prize at Notre Dame School of Architecture for achievements in classical and traditional architecture and sustainable urbanism. ==History== The University of Notre Dame, founded in 1842 by Edward Sorin, is an independent, national Catholic university located in Notre Dame, Indiana. Architecture as a discipline was taught at the University as early as 1869, but it was not until 1898 that an architecture degree was offered. The first architecture graduate was Cuban Eugenio Rayneri Piedra who earned his degree in 1904. From 1931 to 1963, the Law School was houses in what is today Crowley Hall on Main Quad. The building was constructed in 1893 and hosted the Institute of Technology until it was damaged by fire in 1916; after a restoration it housed the Notre Dame Law School until 1931 before hosting the Architecture Department. When the new Hesburgh Library was opened in 1963, the old Lemmonier Library (now Bond Hall) was given to the Department of Architecture. The head of the department, Frank Montana, designed plans to renovate the interiors to fit the new needs of the Architecture school. The original limestone exterior with Ionic detailing on the east side was preserved and restored. A addition was also added to the west elevation. The main challenge during the renovation was the removal of the library stacks, which had a structural function in the building. The interior was reconfigured to serve its new functions as an architecture building and to correspond with its original classical character. The main lobby became an exhibit hall, flanked on the north by the Architecture Library and on the south by a new lecture hall. The basement contained a darkroom and classrooms, and the mezzanine and second floor were converted into classroom space. The renovation itself was a learning experience for the architectural students themselves. Upon competition of the renovation, the new Architecture Hall hosted its first classes on 9 November 1964, while finishing touches were still being added. The formal dedication occurred on 1 May 1965, presided by Rev. Theodore Hesburgh, the University president, and Pietro Belluschi, dean of the School of Architecture at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In 1982, the architecture department became the School of Architecture and in 1994 it became a free-standing entity independent from the College of Engineering. The building was further renovated in 1995, during which the building was closed for 18 months. The $12 million renovation was made possible by a $5 million gift from William W. Bond, Jr. ('50) and his wife Joanne. The School of Architecture moved temporarily to the Hayes-Healy Center and Hurley Hall, which had been vacated by the School of Business for its move to the newly constructed business building on DeBartolo Quad. The renovation also included an American Renaissance-style addition on the west side, designed by Ellerbe Becket under the guidance of architecture chairman Thomas Gordon Smith. The building was rededicated as Bond Hall of Architecture on Friday, 21 March 1997, presided by Rev. Edward Malloy, with speakers including internationally renowned architects Allan Greenberg, Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk, and Demetri Porphyrios, who received honorary degrees from the School of Architecture. In 2016 construction began on a new building to house the School called The Matthew and Joyce Walsh Family Hall. The building was dedicated on November 9th 2018 and the School of Architecture moved into its new location in the following months. ==AcademicsAdmissions=== The University of Notre Dame School of Architecture is accredited by the National Architectural Accrediting Board. Any undergraduate student admitted as an undergraduate to the University of Notre Dame may declare an architecture major. ===Rome Studies Program=== The Rome Studies Program was founded in 1969 as a required third-year study abroad program by Francesco \\"Frank\\" Montana, Department Chair from 1950 to 1972. The program consists of four courses per semester including design studio, hand drawing and watercolor, architectural theory, and architectural history. The curriculum focuses on classical architecture and the design of contemporary buildings in a classical manner following the precedents of Vitruvius, Palladio and Vignola. These trips involve visits to historic sites with presentations by faculty members, time for sketching, and free time to explore the cities. Students analyze the country's historical models of buildings and cities to use as resources in creating architecture in the 21st century. ===Concentrations=== The School of Architecture offers three concentrations: Furniture Design, Preservation and Restoration, and Architectural Practice and Enterprise. Each concentration includes four to five classes across the fourth and fifth year of study. ==Facilities== The Front of Bond Hall, playing host to the University band The School of Architecture is housed in the Walsh Family Hall of Architecture. Construction started on 31 October 2016 and was completed in January 2019, and the 110,000-square-foot building was designed by John Simpson, the structural engineering done by Thornton Tomasetti and built by the Walsh Group. It was named after a $33 million donation by Matthew Walsh. The architecture style is New Classicism and New Urbanism, of which John Simpson is a major figure having won the school's own Driehaus Architecture Prize, and is inspired by the classical elements taught in the √âcole des Beaux-Arts. According to these principles, the building is spartan and durable in its construction materials to maximize functionality, durability, and economy, while having more elaborate and decorated styles in the main entrance, hall of casts, auditoriums and the library. It was built in the southern side of campus, in the new arts district, close to the O‚ÄôNeill Hall, the DeBartolo Performing Arts Center, Charles B. Hayes Family Sculpture Park and the planned Raclin Murphy Museum of Art. The building is centered around a court and provides architecture studios in a two-story wing along the north; a library on the east; with an auditorium and exhibition galleries along the main circulation spine, which is in the form of a Greek stoa. The entrance to the is marked by an Ionic portico, while a tower at the center of the court is positioned to stand out in the views from the university's main entrance and to facilitate access to the external amphitheater. The courtyard of the building features a 14 ft sculpture of Leon Battista Alberti, architect and key feature of the Italian Renaissance, by Scottish sculptor Alexander Stoddart, the artist's tallest single figure. Alberti's ideas of balance and harmony between the individual and the city are inspiration for the new urbanism philosophy taught at the school. Until 2019 it was housed in Bond Hall, a building on the Notre Dame campus formerly known as the Lemonnier Library. The building served as the principal library of the entire campus from its construction in 1917 until Hesburgh Memorial Library was constructed in 1964. The building was renovated and expanded to become Bond Hall between 1995 and 1997 under the guidance of Thomas Gordon Smith, the Department Chair from 1989 to 1998 and current faculty member. Bond Hall contained studio space for both undergraduate and students, several classrooms, and an auditorium that seats approximately 100 people. Bond Hall was then repurposed to house a student-learning center on campus together with Coleman Morse Hall, the Notre Dame Graduate School, the Institute for Latino Studies and the Flatley Center for Undergraduate Scholarly Engagement will move into Bond, along with other units and a new learning initiative for freshmen in STEM. West Lake Hall, which opened in the fall of 2012, is located on the Western edge of campus and holds the School's woodshop. Classes for the Furniture Design and Architecture and the Building Arts Concentrations are held there. The building contains a second shop and studio area for the Industrial Design section of the Department of Art, Art History, & Design at the University of Notre Dame. The University also maintains a Global Gateway in Rome, Italy, with two locations in the historic city center. Included in the building is considerable room for the School's Rome Studies Program, as well as space for other study-abroad students, Notre Dame International, the Notre Dame Club of Italy, and various academic conferences. From 1986-2013, the School of Architecture had a building located on Via Monterone, which consisted of parts of two Roman palazzi. Facilities include studio space for approximately 50-55 students, offices for faculty and staff, an auditorium/meeting room, a small library, a computer cluster, and a student kitchen and dining area. Students live nearby in a hotel just off of Campo de' Fiori. The year-long Rome program was founded in 1969 by the late Frank Montana and is now a requirement for all third-year architecture students. ==The Richard H. Driehaus Prize at the University of Notre Dame== Since 2003, Richard H. Driehaus and the University of Notre Dame School of Architecture have together awarded the annual Richard H. Driehaus Prize at the University of Notre Dame for a lifetime of achievement in classical and traditional architecture and sustainable urbanism. The Driehaus Prize has been presented to architects representing various classical traditions, whose artistic impact reflects their commitment to cultural and environmental conservation. Past winners include L√©on Krier, Allan Greenberg, Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk and Andres Duany, Abdel-Wahed El-Wakil, and Robert A.M. Stern. ==Summer programs== The School often sponsors summer programs to introduce students to international traditional and classical architecture and urbanism. Previous programs have traveled to China, Japan, Cuba, Portugal, Greece, Italy, and the United Kingdom. The programs explore each country's best practices in urban development, sustainable architecture and environmental planning. The China program, typically conducted every other year, look at Asia's architectural traditions and its influence on modern urban living. The program examines how architects and planners have responded to evolving social demands compared to their counterparts in the West. New construction is also studied to learn how the country reflects that heritage even as it evolves. The School of Architecture also provides high school students with the opportunity to study architecture at Notre Dame for two weeks in the summer. The Career Discovery program is intended to help participants decide whether or not they want to pursue architecture in college, and if so, how they should prepare during their junior and senior years of high school. ==Notable alumni== *Gene Bertoncini *John Burgee *Francis D.K.

Self- produced, this pop album is influenced by multiple genres including blue-eyed soul, disco and heavy rock but maintains an overall consistency of production which holds it all together. The album peaked at number 45 on the Billboard Pop Albums chart in 1978, his highest rank up to that point, and includes a top 20 hit, \\"Every Kinda People.\\" The hit single from the album \\"Every Kinda People\\" was written by former Free bassist Andy Fraser. Fraser recorded his own version of the song which he never released but which Palmer heard. This album and the hit single paved the way for his next album Secrets which reached No. 19 on the Billboard charts and gave Palmer his biggest hit yet with the Moon Martin penned \\"Bad Case of Loving You (Doctor, Doctor)\\". The album cracked the Billboard Top 100 peaking at No. 45 thanks to the success of \\"Every Kinda People\\", and two follow up singles continued to keep the album afloat on the charts. The last track \\"You're Going To Get What's Coming\\" penned by Palmer later became a hit single (reaching No. 73 on the Billboard Charts in 1980) for Bonnie Raitt and was featured on her 1979 album The Glow.

His work spanned Broadway, film and television. He is probably best remembered for his bombastic General Bullmoose, which he played in the stage and screen versions of the 1956 musical Li'l Abner. ==On stage== Howard St. John made his Broadway debut in 1926 in the comedy The Blonde Sinner, and subsequently starred or co- starred in more than 20 Broadway productions including Someone Waiting and The Highest Tree. St. John's most high-profile role was that of General Bullmoose in the hit musical Li'l Abner. As Bullmoose he introduced the song \\"Progress is the Root of All Evil.\\" His final Broadway role came in 1968's Tiger at the Gates. ==In film== St. John began film work in the early 1930s and made an impression in Alfred Hitchcock's Strangers on a Train in 1951. He continued in stuffy, rigid or authoritarian roles for most of his career, including memorable ones in The Tender Trap and Born Yesterday. He also re-created his stage role in the film version of Li'l Abner. ==Death== St. John died of a heart attack in New York City at age 68 in 1974 and was survived by his widow. ==Partial filmography== *Shockproof (1949) - Sam Brooks *The Undercover Man (1949) - Joseph S.

Most recently, Scotch Marmo collaborated with Pakistani filmmaker Sabiha Sumar on Good Morning Karachi. Scotch Marmo also teaches screenwriting and, through the Sundance Institute and other organizations, mentors aspiring filmmakers. In 2012, Scotch Marmo received the Andrew Sarris award, which honors outstanding service and artistic achievement by distinguished Columbia Film Program alumni. ==Early life== Scotch Marmo was born and raised in Wakefield, Massachusetts. After receiving an associate degree from Bunker Hill Community College, she went on to earn a bachelor of arts degree as a double major in English Literature and Spanish Language and Literature at Boston University, and her Master of Fine Arts from the Columbia University School of the Arts in 1988. ==CareerThe 1990s=== While Scotch Marmo was still enrolled in Columbia University's graduate film program, her thesis screenplay was acquired by producers Amy Robinson and Griffin Dunne. Robinson and Dunne brought the script to Swedish director Lasse Hallstr√∂m and, in 1991, Once Around became his first American film, starring Richard Dreyfus and Holly Hunter. Also while at Columbia, Scotch Marmo directed an award-winning short film entitled A Secret Thing. During pre-production for Once Around, Scotch Marmo came to the attention of acclaimed film director Steven Spielberg, who hired her to write Hook, also released in 1991. Hook starred Robin Williams as an adult Peter Pan, Dustin Hoffman as Captain Hook, and Julia Roberts as Tinkerbell. Scotch Marmo shared writing credit with James V. Hart and also served as associate producer on the film. While Hook was being shot, Scotch Marmo began working on her next Spielberg project, Jurassic Park, released in 1993. Jurassic Park, which has had four sequels to date, starred Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, and Richard Attenborough. Scotch Marmo wrote the second draft of Jurassic Park, between the drafts of novelist Michael Crichton and David Koepp. Scotch Marmo was next recruited to rewrite Norman Jewison's Only You while on location in Pittsburgh and Rome. Released in 1994, Only You starred Robert Downey, Jr. and Marisa Tomei as star-crossed lovers. From 1994 to 1997, Scotch Marmo focused on developing two projects that never made it to the screen. For director Alfonso Arau, Scotch Marmo adapted Michael Golding's Simple Prayers, a novel set on a small Venetian island in the fourteenth century, and for director Alfonso Cuaron, Scotch Marmo re-wrote Donald Westlake's Love in the Attic, based on the true story of a 1920s housewife who fell in love with a sewing machine repairman and hid him in the attic while her husband was at home. Scotch Marmo next adapted Ludwig Bemelmans' Madeline book series into Madeline. Scotch Marmo received story credit for the film, which was released in 1998, and was directed by Daisy von Scherler Mayer and starred Frances MacDormand. In 1998, Garry Marshall brought in Scotch Marmo to do a production rewrite on The Other Sister. Released in 1999, the film starred Juliette Lewis and Diane Keaton. ===The 2000s=== From 1998 to 2002, Scotch Marmo attempted to get an original screenwriting project off the ground as her first feature-length directorial project. When Fritz Left Kate was developed by various producers, including James L. Brooks, who saw it as a vehicle for Woody Harrelson and Tea Leoni, but the film was not realized. In 2000, Castle Rock Entertainment and Playtone Company hired Scotch-Marmo to adapt Chris Van Allsburg's children's classic Polar Express, to be directed by Rob Reiner and to star Tom Hanks. Polar Express, released in 2004, was ultimately directed by Robert Zemeckis. Scotch Marmo was engaged in 2005 to rewrite Bill Kelly's Enchanted. The film, which was released in 2007, was directed by Kevin Lima, and starred Amy Adams and Patrick Dempsey. In 2005-2008, Scotch Marmo worked on another unproduced project, Winged Boy, which was to have been directed by Luis Mandoki. In 2009-2010, Scotch Marmo collaborated with leading Pakistani director Sabiha Sumar (Khamosh Pani/Silent Waters) to write a screenplay originally entitled Rafina.

He was the legate of Milan and he was elected as bishop at the death of Protasius in 343. Eustorgius traveled to Constantinople to have his election as bishop confirmed by the Emperor, and in that occasion Emperor donated to him the relics of the Three Magi which he translated from Constantinople to Milan. From 345 to 346 and from 347 to 348, he held two synods. He also began construction of churches and basilicas in Milan. Saint Athanasius called him a \\"defender of the faith\\" and mentions him as an opponent of Arianism. Saint Ambrose called him by the honorable title of \\"confessor\\", and just in such a way some verses concerning Milan in ca. 700.Muratori, Ludovico Antonio, Rerum Italicarum scriptores 2, 2, Versus de Mediolano, Bologna 1975, page 689 His name was included in the Ambrosian Rite and his cult in Milan is testified by the presence of five churches dedicated to him (as testified in a 14th-century document, Liber notitiae sanctorum Mediolani ), the best known of which is the Basilica of Sant'Eustorgio. A 5th or 6th century song indicates that he was a famous holy man and that he had built a great sarcophagus.Latin original: :\\"Sunt in antiqua membrana cet. versus S.

There she built over the bodies of the martyrs, who were killed by cruelty of tyrants because their Christian names, substantial memorials. Apart from the many fameful proofs of her piety to God she also accumulated the bodies of the Three Magi together, who were buried in different places, and Helena brought the bodies towards Constantinople. In this city they remained in large honours until the times of the emperor Manuel. At that time Eustorgius lived, Greek birth, a very informed man, nobly and piously, of pleasing exterior, eloquently, for the service to God quite been suitable and in this service turned, a guard of the faith, and also chaste, and a native from Constantinople, before the times of bishop Saint Ambrose of Milan. He came as an ambassador of the emperor Manuel to Milan, and the people of Milan selected him to bishop. Therefore, Eustorgius returned to Constantinople, said thanks to the emperor and spoke: My father and emperor Manuel, I thanks you that you have appreciated the honour towards me up to now and that you have sent me into the holy city Milan, your metropolis. You should know that I have achieved everything, faithfully and after your will, the deliveries are always secured for you, but I am however the chosen one of the city, because you, in honour of God and to praise his charitableness. I unworthy one was urgent asked to return and to announce, what in the view on our God and on you your you faithfully resulted people have done at me and like the people delegated these envoys with me to you. Intend mine and instruct, what I am to do. The emperor answered: Become bishop, worthy man. Eustorgius answers: I thank God and you; but allow, dearest gentleman, that I can carry forward and can take away to the holy city of Milan anything of the sanctuaries, which me liked, if God's benignity permits it, in order to honour the church with holy relics, and as a gratification for your tributary people. The emperor answers: Select, receive, carry forward, which you would like. Be as if you are, or, is it possible, become still better. Greet my people and announce that from now on the whole delivery is issued. Thus Eustorgius went pleased, and he manufactured a marmorean coffin with large effort, and put into it the bodies of the Three Kings, who had brought Christus their gifts - gold, frankincense and myrrh. With trouble under many nights in which he was awake, and through God's assistance and amicability he transported it towards Milan into the city.

Burton is an American production sound mixer. His career has spanned five decades and has included films such as The Shawshank Redemption, Se7en, and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Burton has been nominated for the Academy Award for Best Sound or Best Achievement in Sound Mixing a total of seven times, winning twice; he has been nominated for two BAFTA Film Awards for Best Sound, winning once; and he was nominated for one Emmy Award for Outstanding Achievement in Film Sound Mixing for his work on Roots. ==Early life== Willie D. Burton was born in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. Burton grew up in Alabama, and became fascinated with broadcasting because he lived near a radio station. While attending high school, Burton entered a work-study program in a store that sold and repaired radios and TVs. He became experienced repairing radios, and began to experiment with improving and learning more about the electronics. His attention then moved to sound and sound mixing. His work at the electronic shop fed Burton's fascination with electronics and sound, but he was obstructed by the limited opportunities for African-Americans to work in the field, especially in the Deep South. In the midst of the Civil Rights Movement, Alabama was slow in its movement toward equality in job opportunities. As his motivation and interest grew, Burton made the decision to move to Long Beach, California after high school graduation. Burton attended a trade school and then Compton City College, where he studied electronics technology. ==Career== After graduating from Compton City College, Burton worked on sonar technology for the Department of the Navy, but his ultimate goal was to work in broadcasting. He was prevented from accomplishing this goal because he needed to be a union member to work in Hollywood. Finally, in 1969, he made it into the International Sound Technicians union. Burton was the first black man to be officially accepted into the union. This led to an entry-level job on the TV series Land of the Giants, directed by Harry Harris, Sobey Martin and Nathan Juran. Between TV jobs, which also included work as a boom operator on Medical Center and Gunsmoke, Burton worked as a custodian at a bank. A friend from one of his TV jobs helped train Burton on sound-mixing equipment. Burton gained an immense amount of interest in sound mixing as he developed and polished his talents. Those who worked with him in Hollywood soon recognized his potential. Burton's big break into the sound-mixing world came in 1975, when he heard that Sidney Poitier was directing the film Let's Do It Again, with Bill Cosby. Poitier agreed to hire Burton. This decision launched him into a career that has spanned five decades. With seven nominations each, Burton and television producer Quincy Jones are currently the Academy's most-honored African-Americans in the film industry. ==Awards== In 1988, Burton won the Academy Award for Sound for the film Bird and again in 2006 for Dreamgirls. He was nominated for the same award in 1978 for The Buddy Holly Story, in 1980 for Altered States, in 1983 for WarGames, in 1994 for The Shawshank Redemption, and in 1999 for Green Mile. He won a British Academy Award in 1983 for his work on the film War Games. Burton has been nominated for the Academy Award for Best Sound or Best Achievement in Sound Mixing a total of seven times, winning twice. He has been nominated for two BAFTA Film Awards for Best Sound, winning once. He was nominated for one Emmy Award for Outstanding Achievement in Film Sound Mixing for his work on Roots. With his seventh Oscar nomination for Dreamgirls (2006) in 2007, Burton tied composer/producer Quincy Jones for the most Academy Award nominations by an African-American. As of 2010, Burton, sound engineer Russell Williams II and actors Denzel Washington and Mahershala Ali are the only African-Americans that have won two Oscars. ==Nominated films== *Dreamgirls (2006) :Oscar - Won - Best Sound Mixing :Cinema Audio Society - Won - Outstanding Sound Mixing for Motion Pictures :Satellite Award - Won - Best Sound (Editing & Mixing) *The Green Mile (1999) :Oscar - Nominated - Best Sound *The Shawshank Redemption (1994) :Oscar - Nominated - Best Sound *In the Line of Fire (1993) :Cinema Audio Society - Nominated - Outstanding Sound Mixing for a Feature Film *Bird (1988) :Oscar - Won - Best Sound :BAFTA Film Award - Nominated - Best Sound *WarGames (1983) :Oscar - Nominated - Best Sound :BAFTA Film Award - Won - Best Sound *Altered States (1980) :Oscar - Nominated - Best Sound *The Buddy Holly Story (1978) :Oscar - Nominated - Best Sound *Roots (1977) :Primetime Emmy - Nominated - Outstanding Film Sound Mixing ==References== ==External links== * Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:American audio engineers Category:Production sound mixers Category:Best Sound BAFTA Award winners Category:Best Sound Mixing Academy Award winners Category:People from Tuscaloosa, Alabama ","title":"Willie D.

His father founded the Duchy of Mecklenburg- Strelitz in 1701 after reaching an agreement with the Duke of Mecklenburg- Schwerin. He succeeded his father as Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz on 12 May 1708. In 1712 the ducal family‚Äôs castle and the town of Strelitz burnt down. Because of this Adolphus Frederick and his family were forced to live in their hunting lodge. Around this place the new town of Neustrelitz was constructed. In 1733 he founded the new city, which became the official capital of Mecklenburg-Strelitz in 1736. Adolphus Frederick died at Neustrelitz and was succeeded as Duke by his nephew Adolphus Frederick IV. ==Marriage and children== Dorothea of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Pl√∂n, duchess of Mecklenburg-Strelitz Adolphus Frederick was married to Princess Dorothea of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Pl√∂n (daughter of John Adolphus, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Pl√∂n) on 16 April 1709 at Reinfeld.

The bit, which is bit 9 of the FLAGS register, may be set or cleared by programs with sufficient privileges, as usually determined by the operating system. If the flag is set to \`1\`, maskable hardware interrupts will be handled. If cleared (set to \`0\`), such interrupts will be ignored. IF does not affect the handling of non-maskable interrupts (NMIs) or software interrupts generated by the INT instruction. == Setting and clearing == The flag may be set or cleared using the CLI (Clear Interrupts), STI (Set Interrupts) and POPF (Pop Flags) instructions. CLI clears IF (sets to 0), while STI sets IF to 1. POPF pops 16 bits off the stack into the FLAGS register, which means IF will be set or cleared based on the ninth bit on the top of the stack. == Privilege level == In all three cases, only privileged applications (usually the OS kernel) may modify IF. Note that this only applies to protected mode code. (Real mode code may always modify IF.) CLI and STI are privileged instructions, which trigger a general protection fault if an unprivileged application attempts to execute it, while POPF will simply not modify the IF flag if the application is unprivileged. The privilege level required to execute a CLI or STI instruction, or set IF using POPF, is determined by the IOPL (I/O Privilege Level) in EFLAGS. If the IOPL is set to 2 for example, any program running only in ring 0 can execute a CLI. Most modern operating systems set the IOPL to be 0 so only the kernel can execute CLI/STI. The reason for this is that since clearing IF will force the processor to ignore all interrupts, the kernel may never get control back if it is not set to 1 again. === Old DOS programs === Some old DOS programs that use a protected mode DOS extender and install their own interrupt handlers (usually games) use the CLI instruction in the handlers to disable interrupts and either POPF (after a corresponding PUSHF) or IRET (which restores the flags from the stack as part of its effects) to restore it. This works if the program was started in real mode, but causes problems when such programs are run in a DPMI-based container on modern operating systems (such as NTVDM under Windows NT or later). Since CLI is a privileged instruction, it triggers a fault into the operating system when the program attempts to use it. The OS then typically stops delivering interrupts to the program until the program executes STI (which would cause another fault). However, the POPF instruction is not privileged and simply fails silently to restore the IF. The result is that the OS stops delivering interrupts to the program, which then hangs. DOS programs that do not use a protected mode extender do not suffer from this problem, as they execute in V86 mode where POPF does trigger a fault. There are few satisfactory resolutions to this issue. It is usually not possible to modify the program as source code is typically not available and there is no room in the instruction stream to introduce a STI without massive editing at the assembly level. Removing CLI's from the program or causing the V86 host to ignore CLI completely might cause other bugs if the guest's interrupt handlers are not re-entrant safe (though when executed on a modern processor, they typically execute fast enough to avoid overlapping of interrupts). == CLI == CLI is commonly used as a synchronization mechanism in uniprocessor systems. For example, a CLI is used in operating systems to disable interrupts so kernel code (typically a driver) can avoid race conditions with an interrupt handler. Note that CLI only affects the interrupt flag for the processor on which it is executed; in multiprocessor systems, executing a CLI instruction does not disable interrupts on other processors. Thus, a driver/interrupt handler race condition can still occur because other processors may service interrupts and execute the offending interrupt handler. For these systems, other synchronization mechanisms such as locks must be used in addition to CLI/STI to prevent all race conditions. Because the HLT instruction halts until an interrupt occurs, the combination of a CLI followed by a HLT is commonly used to intentionally hang the computer. == STI == The STI instruction enables interrupts by setting the IF. One interesting quirk about the STI instruction is that, unlike CLI which has an immediate effect, interrupts are not actually enabled until after the instruction immediately following the STI. One side effect of this could be IF=0, then executing a CLI instruction immediately after an STI instruction means that interrupts are never recognized. The STI instruction sets the IF flag, but interrupts are not checked for until after the next instruction which in this case would be the CLI which takes effect immediately. This behavior exists so a processor that constantly takes interrupts can still make forward progress.

Komati Gorge is located near the communities of Carolina and Machadodorp. The Komati River flows through the gorge and provides riparian cover for many species of flora and fauna, including several endemic endangered species and big game animals. The geology of the vertical cliffs of the gorge offer a diverse set of colourful mineralized exposures. ==Geology== Within the Komati Gorge are exposures of the Kromberg Formation and upper Hooggenoeg Formation of the Onverwacht Series in which debris flows, turbidites, and thin gray chert units are exhibited. There are also exposures of black and white banded cherts interbedded with basalt flows representing eastern faces of Black Reef Chert. A banded iron formation is exposed in the bluffs. ==Ecology== Komati Gorge western cliffs. The Komati Gorge contains a great diversity of flora and fauna, including many large mammalian species. There are several discrete types of habitat present, including riparian zone, bluff habitat, thorn bushveld and highveld grassland. The river provides not only water for wildlife and aquatic vegetation, but also supports a robust riverine trout fishery. The bluffs support a very specialized ecosystem including vegetation adapted to the steep rocky vertical landform of the gorge sides.C. Michael Hogan and Amy Gregory, Ecology of Komati Gorge, Lumina Technologies, July 22, 2006 In addition there are favourable opportunities for bird habitat, providing more protection from certain predators; for example the threatened southern bald ibis inhabits these cliff habitats. Mammal species include big game animals as well as smaller fauna; for example zebra and giraffe can be found on the bushveld. Eland, Impala and other bovids are numerous. Approximately three million years ago the underlying geological formations took shape in the Komati Gorge area, producing one of the Earth's rarest and most endangered ecosystems, the ancient grasslands of Africa. With increasing rainfall on the lowlands, an invasion of trees ensued, constituting the bushveld of the lowveld ecosystems present here. ==Access and condition== Access is from the north, via the towns of Carolina or Machadodorp, which towns are near the main highway leading to Johannesburg. Most of the Komati Gorge has been historically privately owned wilderness, with some ranching arriving in the latter half of the 20th century. Since the late 20th century there has been limited development of a lodge and a few country homes. As of 2006, visitation to the Komati Gorge is not intense, although there has been a recent case of geo- vandalism in the form of illegal drilling of some of the rock outcrops.Geo- vandalism at Komati Gorge Geo-vandalism is a term meaning defacing, alteration or drilling in significant rock formations either for unauthorised fossil collection, mineral exploration or malicious destruction. == References== ==External links== *Southern Bald Ibis sightings at Komati Gorge Category:Komati River Category:River valleys of South Africa Category:Canyons and gorges of South Africa Category:Landforms of Mpumalanga ","title":"Komati Gorge"},{"id":"9111253","text":"Stephen Anthony Guinan (born 24 December 1975) is an English former footballer who played as a striker for Nottingham Forest, Greensboro Dynamo, Darlington, Burnley, Crewe Alexandra, Halifax Town, Plymouth Argyle, Scunthorpe United, Cambridge United, Shrewsbury Town, Hereford United, Cheltenham Town, Northampton Town, Forest Green Rovers and Kidderminster Harriers. ==Playing Career== Steve was born in Birmingham and started his career as a trainee at Nottingham Forest.

When erotica is specifically directed at lesbians, it is referred to as lesbian erotica. Women's erotica is available from a variety of media including video games, websites, books, comics, short stories, films, photography, magazines, audio, anime and manga. The content may cover many aspects of sexuality, from relationships to fetishes; the main idea being to convey sex-positivism from a woman's perspective, or to feature female empowerment and sexual fantasies.Ms Naughty, A History of Porn for Women 2006 ==Websites== Because of the privacy and anonymity offered by the internet, women have increasingly embraced erotic material online. In 2003, Nielsen Netratings noted that more than a quarter of all porn surfers were female.Mireya Navarro, \\"Women tailor sex industry to their eyes,\\" New York Times, 20 February 2004 The first women's erotica subscription-based website, Purve, was launched in 1998. The site featured photos of nude men culled from gay sites, articles and sex advice. Sssh.com, a similar subscription site that features original movies and photographic content, was launched in 1999 by Angie Rowntree, who was later inducted into the Adult Video News Hall of Fame, Internet Founders Division, in recognition of her efforts to help establish and grow an online market for women's erotica. In 2015, Sssh.com became the first porn-for-women site to win the XBIZ Award for Best Alternative Site. The first women's adult directory was Ladylynx which featured links to galleries and site reviews. Kara's Links, a similar directory site, began operating soon after. ==Fiction== Erotic literature for women has seen explosive growth in the period 2010‚Äì2015. Publishers report that women's erotica novels consistently sell well. The first publishing imprint of erotic fiction for women was Black Lace, launched in Britain in 1992. It remained unique in publishing for over a decade and was only recently joined in the marketplace by big-name publishers Harlequin, Kensington and Avon who have released their own \\"black label\\" lines for female readers. The first series of books to feature erotic short stories for women was Herotica, first published by Down There Press in 1996. Author and sex activist Susie Bright founded the series and edited the first three volumes. A similar series is Best Women‚Äôs Erotica from Cleis Press which has appeared annually since 2001. Internet-based publisher Ellora's Cave produces what it calls \\"romantica\\" - romance novels with explicit sex scenes. The company originally produced e-books but has now moved into printed publishing. ==Films== Women were not acknowledged as a potential audience by pornographic filmmakers until 1985 when former adult star Candida Royalle created her first adult movie for women, Femme. The movie featured explicit sex but focused on the woman's pleasure and refused to include \\"pop shots\\" (external ejaculation scenes). Since then she has made 16 adult films for women. In April 2007, she launched a new line of films, Femme Chocolat, which depicts the sexual fantasies of black women. For many years Candida Royalle was the sole producer of erotic films for women. In 1997, Oscar-nominated director Lars von Trier started the company Puzzy Power, and together with Lene B√∏rglum started producing pornographic films for women, starting with Constance (1998) and Pink Prison (1999). In July 2009, women's magazine Cosmopolitan (German edition) ranked Pink Prison as #1 in its Top Five of Die Besten Frauenpornos (best women's porn), calling it the \\"Vorbild f√ºr die neue Porno-Generation\\" (role model for the new porn-generation).Cosmopolitan, July 2009, page 30 In the 21st century a number of other women have stepped in and created their own vision of women's erotica.

Not Faking It... (2008), as well as editing the anthology DVD Her Porn (2009). * Swedish filmmaker Erika Lust whose short film The Good Girl (2004) was included in her feature film Five Hot Stories for Her (2006). * Nina Lennox, who has produced the Inpulse line of films. These focus mainly on good looking male talent. * Adult star Tina Tyler, who has created a line of male masturbation films for women. * Longtime adult producer Kelly Holland, who runs an adult company called Chick Media and produces films for women. In 2006 Playgirl in partnership with adult company Wicked produced and released their own line of adult films for women. ==Television== In 2009, Dusk! TV started in the Netherlands with a 24-hour linear television channel with only erotica and female-friendly porn. All the above mention films are broadcast. More women are starting to produce erotic films. Mostly small, independent products and usually from a sense of dissatisfaction with mainstream porn.

L. Bhyrappa, and starring Pavitra Lokesh in the lead role. The film won three Karnataka State Film Awards. The film is mostly shot in Coastal of Karnataka near Udupi Nadibettu House at Shirva, Billampadavu Shooting House, house of one Rajeshwar Shashtri of Chakrakodi near Moodambail and island near Kallianpur and Kundapura. == Plot summary == Acchanniah lives with his wife Nagalakshmi and his widowed daughter-in-law Venkatalakshmi in a remote village in Karnataka. His granddaughter Rajalakshmi is in a distant city completing her studies. Acchanniah learns from a friend that a young man in a distant village claims that he was the son of Acchanniah in his previous birth. He dismisses the information as baseless. But his ailing wife believes or rather chooses to believe that her son who died twenty years ago has come back. Acchanniah sets out to meet the young man who is about twenty years old and provides some information regarding his previous birth which tallies with or appears to tally with his previous birth. Acchanniah brings home this man whose name is Vishwa. Acchannaih's wife realises a new purpose in living and accepts this stranger as her son. But Venkatalakshmi, Acchanniah's daughter- in-law, finds it difficult to accept some stranger as her long-lost husband. After some initial resistance, Venkatalakshmi realises that this is an opportunity to attain all that she is restrained from. Her desires emerge again and she accepts Vishwa as her husband. It is here that problems start. The society which forced her to believe it is her husband does not approve of Venkatalakshmi accepting the man as her husband and living with him. Rajalakshmi swears that this stranger who is her age is not her father. She tries to convince her mother to come out of such a delusion but to no avail. Acchanniah and Nagalakshmi are shocked to hear that Venkatalakshmi is pregnant with Vishwa's child. Matter complicate and Acchanniah is humiliated in the public by his fellow Brahmins. Venkatalakshmi sensing the intensity of the situation leaves the village and lives in a god-forsaken place with Vishwa. She has a hard life trying to manage ends meet. Vishwa is an eccentric young man and keeping him in control is not easy. To worsen things, Vishwa is attracted to Sukri, a young woman from the worker class. Nagalakshmi dies unable to digest these bizarre happenings. Rajalakshmi decides to seek the help of the court to get her mother back. They file a false complaint on Vishwa. Aware of the family's sinister motives, Vishwa refuses to return to Venkatalakshmi. Meanwhile, a daughter is born to Venkatalakshmi. The court announces Vishwa guilty and he is sent to two years rigorous imprisonment. But Venkatalakshmi declares that she will wait for him to be released although she is certain that he will not return to her. She tells her daughter that she never believed that Vishwa was her husband reincarnate. == Principal cast == * Pavitra Lokesh as Venkatalakshmi * Rameshwari Varma as Nagalakshmi * Sringeri Ramanna as Ajjaiah * Ananya Kasaravalli * Ashwin Bolar as Vishweshwara * A. R. Chandrasekhara * Ramesh == The 'inner' theme == Naayi Neralu has a very complex theme of great intensity. Earlier films of Girish Kasaravalli focused on social themes but were very straight in their narrative. Naayi Neralu leaves enough for the viewer to interpret and analyze. On the outside the film deals with three members of a family dealing with a very bizarre situation. But the inner theme is much more complex and can be an analyzed in many dimensions. It is a culmination of many aspects of life: human relationships, man and society, multiple perspectives on a situation, and so on. Each of the protagonists look at the situation the way they want to. Although the title suggests rebirth, the film deals with how people react to such a situation. == Highlights == * The intensity of the plot unfolds very well in the film. In the beginning, it is just a rumour. But in the end, it is a devastating truth. The transition from the former to the latter evolves successfully. * The character of Venkatalakshmi emerges as a very strong individual towards the end. She tells her father-in-law that she has lived her life doing things which others say and that she has decided to live the way she wants to. In the end, we realize what a strong character she has been. * Girish Kasaravalli's film needs no introduction regarding its climax. As in all his films, the climax is one of the major highlights of Naayi Neralu. The final scene shows Venkatalakshmi standing on the riverbanks with her child in hand looking at her daughter and father-in-law leave in a boat. This is the director's way of telling the audience that Venkatalakshmi has evolved into a strong individual. == Actors and performances == The role of Venkatalakshmi was played by Pavitra Lokesh, a well-established actress in Kannada cinema. She proved her worth as a very good actress in the film. Rameshwari Varma who played the role of Nagalakshmi is a theatre actress and this was her second film. Ananya Kasaravalli gives a memorable performance as Rajalakshmi. Sringeri Ramanna as Acchanniah excels as a sensitive father-in-law caught between the affection for his daughter-in-law and the laws of the society. Naayi Neralu was Ashwin Bolar's debut feature and his first venture into the Indian film industry. == Awards and screenings == * Karnataka State Film Awards 2005-06 ** First Best Film ** Best Director ‚Äì Girish Kasaravalli ** Best Actress ‚Äì Pavitra Lokesh V Shantaram Awards: * Best Director ‚Äì Girish Kasaravalli Osian's Asian Film Festival, CINEFAN, 2006: * Jury award in the Indian Film Category.

The original is an enigmatic tale of Karma and its repayment in subsequent births. In the film, there is huge chunk removed from what the book says that renders the story a single-themed narrative. For instance, the book touches upon how Vishwa was born and why he had to be reborn upon his accidental death. Acchannaiah's role in what Vishwa goes through in his births is significant in the book. The narrative of the film fails to explain why it had to be called Naayi Neralu. == References == Category:2000s Kannada-language films Category:Kannada literature Category:Films directed by Girish Kasaravalli Category:Indian films ","title":"Naayi Neralu"},{"id":"9111335","text":"The Grand River is a river that stretches from northernmost tributary origins between Creston and Winterset in Iowa approximately U.S. Geological Survey.

Its watershed of , with three-quarters in Missouri, makes it the largest watershed serving the Missouri River in northern Missouri. ==History of the Grand River region== Fort D'Orleans was erected by French explorer √âtienne de Veniard, Sieur de Bourgmont which is believed to have been at the mouth of the Grand on Missouri River in 1723 (the French named the river \\"La Grande Rivi√©re\\").Kansas - A Cyclopedia of State History, Embracing Events, Institutions, Industries, Counties, Cities, Towns, Prominent Persons, Etc. , Edited by Frank W. Blackmart, 1912 The fort was abandoned in 1726 and has been obliterated by floods. The area was part of Ioway Indian tribal territory through the 1820s. The Ioway chief Big Neck (aka Great Walker) had his village on the Grand River before 1824 and into 1829. The Big Neck War: In July 1829, a large party of Iowa (or Ioway) Native Americans, led by Chief Big Neck, returned to their former hunting grounds in violation of treaty. One of the Ioway's dogs killed a pig and they threatened (or insulted, according to some sources) the white women. The settlers sent messengers south to Randolph and Macon counties asking for help. Captain William Trammell responded with a party of some two dozen men to help. By the time of their arrival, the Ioways had left the area and moved upriver into what is now Schuyler County. Trammell's force, augmented by several of the men from The Cabins, pursued and engaged the Ioway at a place called Battle Creek, killing several Native Americans including Big Neck's brother, sister-in-law, and their child. The Trammell party lost three men in the skirmish, including Captain Trammell himself, and one additional casualty died of his wounds shortly afterward. Discretion being the better part of valor, the surviving whites returned to the cabins, collected the women and children, and headed south for the Randolph County settlement of Huntsville. Later, a group of militia under General John B. Clark pursued and apprehended Big Neck and his braves, capturing them in March 1830. Soon, several escaped from jail and fled to the current state of Iowa; however, Big Neck himself and the remainder were put on trial by a grand jury of Randolph County. The jury found on March 31, 1830, that: \\"After examining all the witnesses, and maturely considering the charges for which these Iowa Indians are now in confinement, we find them not guilty, and they are at once discharged.\\" The acquittal of Big Neck seemed to have brought the war to a peaceful, if uneasy, conclusion. A few months later, white settlers returned to The Cabins, this time in greater numbers, and this time to stay permanently. In 1835 the Missouri Legislature declared it a navigable stream to the Iowa line, although steamboat traffic never extended much further than Chillicothe. Even then boats had difficulty with the river's changing water levels, and sometimes it was too low for them to travel that far upriver. The town of Bedford is named for a steamer that sank there.\\"Grand River Watershed\\" , Historic and Recent Land Use, Missouri Department of Conservation - In 1837-38, Joseph Smith, founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, said Adam-ondi-Ahman near Gallatin, Missouri was the site where Adam and Eve lived after being evicted from the Garden of Eden. ==Geography== The West and East Forks of the Grand rise just south of Creston in Union County, Iowa. The Middle Fork rises at Mount Ayr, Iowa in Ringgold County, Iowa. The three forks merge just south of Albany, Missouri in Gentry County. That is where the river officially assumes the single Grand River name. The biggest confluence of streams is at Chillicothe, where the Thompson River and Shoal, Medicine, and Locust creeks merge with the river. The Grand River Basin has more than 1,000 third order or higher streams. Swan Lake National Wildlife Refuge is on the Yellow Creek tributary at Sumner, Missouri. No dams have been built on the river. At various times plans have been proposed for five dams, with the most prominent being the Pattonsburg Dam at Pattonsburg, Missouri. The United States Corps of Engineers bought out the residents after the Great Flood of 1993; but, the proposed dam has not been authorized. Average discharge for the Grand at Sumner, Missouri is 3,917 cubic feet per second (111 m3/s). The maximum instantaneous peak flow of 180,000 cu ft/s (5,100 m3/s) occurred in June, 1947. During the 1993 flood 150,000 cu ft/s (4,200 m3/s) was reported at Sumner. The Grand descends at a rate of about three feet per mile (0.5 m/km), although the Pop's Branch near Princeton, Missouri descends at 44 feet per mile (8 m/km). ==See also== *List of rivers of Iowa ==References== Category:Rivers of Iowa Category:Rivers of Missouri Category:Tributaries of the Missouri River Category:Rivers of Carroll County, Missouri Category:Rivers of Chariton County, Missouri Category:Rivers of Daviess County, Missouri Category:Rivers of Gentry County, Missouri Category:Rivers of Livingston County, Missouri Category:Rivers of Mercer County, Missouri Category:Bodies of water of Ringgold County, Iowa Category:Bodies of water of Union County, Iowa Category:Mississippi River watershed ","title":"Grand River (Missouri)"},{"id":"9111357","text":"9.0 may refer to: *9 (disambiguation) *9.0: Live ","title":"9.0"},{"id":"9111392","text":"Frank Broome (11 June 1915 ‚Äì 10 September 1994) was an English professional footballer and manager.

Bain began his professional career in England before moving to the United States in 1978. Over his twenty-year playing career, Bain played for numerous leagues and teams, both indoors and out. After retiring from playing professionally, he has coached at the professional, youth club and high school levels in the US. ==Player== Although born in Scotland, Bain's father was a scout for the English club Bristol City. Bain signed with Bristol City in July 1974, but was unable to break into the first team. In 1976, Bristol loaned him to Brentford for the 1976/77 season. In 1978, Bristol transferred two players, defender Brian McNeill and John Bain to the Portland Timbers of the North American Soccer League. Before moving to the United States and joining the Timbers, Bain played on Scotland's U-18 and U-21 teams. He would never return to play in Britain or for the Scottish national teams. During five seasons with the Timbers, Bain became one of the team's all-time greatest players. He would go on to score 45 goals and assist on 55 others giving him the Timbers' record for career goals and assists. Additionally, he is in second place on the list of games played with 148. In addition to his outdoor success, Bain played in both the 1980‚Äì1981 and 1981‚Äì1982 NASL indoor seasons. In the 1980‚Äì1981 season, he scored 20 goals in 15 games. In the 1981‚Äì1982 NASL indoor season, his scoring pace dropped as he only bagged 8 goals in 18 games. The Timbers folded at the end of the 1982 outdoor season and the Seattle Sounders picked up Bain in the dispersal draft. He would play a single season with the Sounders, before they also folded. In 1984, he played with the Minnesota Strikers in the NASL's last season. When the NASL collapsed in 1984, the Strikers moved to the Major Indoor Soccer League (MISL). Bain played one season indoors with the Strikers, then moved to the Kansas City Comets, also of the MISL, for the next two seasons. In 1989, Bain returned to Portland as a player/coach for the new Portland Timbers of the Western Soccer League (WSL). This team had begun existence as F.C. Portland, but had reclaimed the name and heritage of the NASL Timbers for the 1989 season. Bain was selected to the league's first team All Star list that year. In 1990, the WSL merged with the American Soccer League to form the American Professional Soccer League (APSL). Bain remained with the team as a player/coach. At the end of the season, the Timbers owner, Art Dixon, folded the team after losing $500,000 over two years. ==CoachHigh school=== Bain left playing and began full-time coaching. In 1991 and 1992, Bain led the Mountain View High School men's soccer team to back-to-back Washington State Championship Titles. In addition, Bain's Mountain View High School soccer team was recognised by USA Today as being the 6th best boys' soccer team in the nation. ===Portland Pride=== In 1993, Bain returned to Portland to become the first coach / player of the Portland Pride of the Continental Indoor Soccer League. He coached the team until 1996. ===Youth coach=== Beginning in 1995, Bain has coached various youth teams of the Westside Timbers (formerly Westside Metros) in Beaverton, Oregon. He also coached with the club in 1991 before moving to Washington State. He married his wife Darcy when with the NASL Timbers. His son Brendon played for Las Vegas Strikers of the National Premier Soccer League. He is currently married to Shannon Bain.

The National Rail Museum in Chanakyapuri, New Delhi, displays exhibits on the history of rail transport in India. The museum was inaugurated on 1 February 1977. The museum spans over an area of over 11 acres and the indoor gallery comprises of an octagonal building which houses six display galleries and a large open area is laid out to simulate the atmosphere of a railway yard. It is open every day except Mondays and national holidays. ==History== A Transport Museum was first proposed in 1962, under the advise of rail enthusiast Michael Graham Satow. The proposal took a concrete shape in 1970 and on 7 October 1971 the foundation stone was laid at the museum's present site in Chanakyapuri, New Delhi, by the then-President of India V. V. Giri. The museum was inaugurated as the Rail Transport Museum in 1977 by Kamalapati Tripathi, the minister for public transportation. The museum was originally intended to be a part of a larger museum that covered the history of railways, roadways, airways, and waterways in India; however, this never happened and it was officially renamed the National Rail Museum in 1995. ==Facilities== Auditorium: The museum has a state of the art auditorium with seating capacity of 200 persons. VIP Lounge: The museum has a state of the art air-conditioned conference hall with seating capacity of 20-25 persons. The Rails: The Rails is a restaurant situated in the museum. It is housed in a replica the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus main building. The restaurant depicts the formation of Indian Railways through unification of 42 independent railway companies held by the princely states of India and British East Indian Company. The Maharaja of Gwalior had a silver model train that ran along the banquet table and served food to the royal guests. The restaurant replicates this by making a steam locomotive chug around the restaurant and serve food at tables named after historic stations in the country. Souvenir shop: There is a souvenir shop where small scale models of rolling stock, books, apparels, frame and prints, etc are available for sale. ==Exhibits== The Patiala State Monorail The Fairy Queen steam locomotive (built 1855). Electric locomotive 4502 Sir Leslie Wilson Electric locomotive 4006 Sir Roger Lumley * Patiala State Monorail Trainways: This unique steam monorail was built in 1907. The train is based on the Ewing System and connected the town of Bassi with the city of Sirhind-Fatehgarh, approximately apart. This unique train system consists of a single-rail track on which the load-carrying wheel runs, while large iron wheels on either side keep the train upright. The train was built by Orenstein & Koppel of Berlin and ran until October 1927 when the line was closed. The engine and the chief engineer's inspection car remained in the railways' scrapyard where they were discovered by railroad historian Mike Satow in 1962. One of the engines was restored to full working order by the Northern Railway Workshops in Amritsar. The Chief Engineer's private inspection car was also reconstructed on an old under-frame. The two are now in working condition and are on display at the museum. * Fairy Queen: The world's oldest working steam locomotive in operational service.This locomotive is taken out on heritage runs a couple of times in a year. * Morris Fire Engine: The Morris Fire Engine was built by the fire engineers John Morris and Sons Ltd of Salford, Lancashire, in 1914. The only other Morris-Belsize fire- engine known to exist is preserved by the Whitewebbs Museum of Transport, Clay Hill, London. It was converted to use pneumatic tires, while the fire engine runs on solid rubber tires. * Electric locomotive 4502 Sir Leslie Wilson: This 1928 WCG-1 locomotive belonged to the Great Indian Peninsular Railway (presently Central Railway). It is one of India's first generation 1,500 V DC electric locomotives, which were known as khakis (English: crabs) since they make a curious moaning sound when at rest, and while in motion the linkage emits an unusual swishing sound. Its unusual features included an articulated body, which made it ideal for use in heavily curved sections of the Ghat mountains. The WCG-1 was in operation as a shunting locomotive until 1994 at Mumbai's Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus. * Electric locomotive 4006 Sir Roger Lumley: This WCP-1 locomotive has unique wheel arrangements. These locomotives were supplied by the Vulcan Foundry, UK, in 1930. They were electric locomotives operating under 1,500 V DC. They are known for hauling the Mumbai‚ÄìPune Deccan Queen Express in its early years.

It is located in the municipality of Sluis, about 8 km northwest of Oostburg. The village contains 790 inhabitants (2010). Better known to many visitors is the nearby beach at Cadzand-Bad. Cadzand was the scene of two battles during the Hundred Years' War *1337-Battle of Cadzand *1387-Battle of Margate Under the Secret Treaty of Dover, concluded in 1670 between Charles II of England and Louis XIV of France, England was supposed to get possession of Cadzand as well as Walcheren, as the reward for helping France in the then impending war against the Dutch Republic. In the event, the Dutch resistance - much stronger than anticipated - managed to repulse the French-English attack, and the treaty was not implemented. In 1685 Cadzand was an important station on the escape route of Jean Harlan, a Huguenot from Calais, who escaped after Louis XIV's Revocation of the Edict of Nantes, reached Cadzand in a small boat and eventually founded a successful merchant family in Germany. Cadzand was also an important destination that year and shortly thereafter for other Huguenot refugees from the Calais area when their temple at Guinness was demolished by royal decree in the summer of that year. Three in particular were the Morel brothers, Isaac, Jacob and Pierre (changed to Pieter after moving to Cadzand), and the two brothers Jacob and Isaac Van Houte. All five \\"had been large landowners at Guemps, Offequerque, Hames, and Andres, close to Calais.\\" Similar to a sister church in Canterbury, Kent, England, they helped re-build in Cadzand the mother church they lost in Guinness, Calais.Dr. Johannes de Hullu, Register of the Walloon Church of Cadzand in Holland, 1685-1724, page 7 During the year 1847 a large exodus of people from Cadzand, occurred, mainly to the United States.

In 2009, Spring was named Central Region Assistant Coach of the Year along with Ivankov after helping Illinois to the Big Ten Championship, a fifth-place finish at the NCAA Championships and three individual NCAA titles. In 2012, Spring helped University of Illinois Fighting Illini win the NCAA national championship in Gymnastics. https://web.archive.org/web/20120430011148/http://www.fightingillini.com/sports/m-gym/recaps/042012aaj.html Player Bio, Justin Spring ==References== * * ==External links== * * * Category:1984 births Category:Living people Category:College men's gymnastics coaches in the United States Category:Gymnasts at the 2007 Pan American Games Category:Gymnasts at the 2008 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic gymnasts of the United States Category:Olympic bronze medalists for the United States in gymnastics Category:Sportspeople from Fairfax County, Virginia Category:People from Houston Category:American male artistic gymnasts Category:Medalists at the 2008 Summer Olympics Category:Illinois Fighting Illini men's gymnasts Category:Illinois Fighting Illini men's gymnastics coaches Category:Pan American Games bronze medalists for the United States Category:Pan American Games medalists in gymnastics Category:People from Burke, Virginia ","title":"Justin Spring"},{"id":"9111540","text":"Eustorgius or Eustorge can refer to: *Eustorgius I, bishop of Milan from 344 to 350 *Eustorgius II, bishop of Milan from 512 to 518 *Eustorge de Scorailles, bishop of Limoges from 1106 until 1137 *Eustorgius of Nicomedia, father of Saint Pantaleon *Eustorgius of Montaigu, archbishop of Nicosia in the 13th century ==See also== *Basilica of Sant'Eustorgio ","title":"Eustorgius"},{"id":"9111572","text":"Araminta Estelle \\"Minta\\" Durfee (October 1, 1889 ‚Äì September 9, 1975) was an American silent film actress from Los Angeles, California, possibly best known for her role in Mickey (1918). ==Biography== She met Roscoe Arbuckle when he was attempting to get started in theater, and the two married in August 1908. Durfee entered show business in local companies as a chorus girl at the age of 17. She was the first leading lady of Charlie Chaplin. Durfee and Arbuckle separated in 1921, just prior to a scandal involving the death of starlet Virginia Rappe. There were three trials and finally Arbuckle was acquitted. His career was destroyed and he received few job offers. Durfee and Arbuckle divorced in 1925. Durfee in her later years said Arbuckle was \\"the most generous human being I've ever met\\", and \\"if I had to do it all over again, I'd still marry the same man.\\" Durfee was an avid defender of her close friend Mabel Normand throughout Normand's many public scandals. A regular performer on television, Durfee appeared on such shows as Noah's Ark (1956). She had minor roles in motion pictures including How Green Was My Valley (1941), Naughty Marietta (1935), Rose-Marie (1936), It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World (1963), The Unsinkable Molly Brown (1964), and Savage Intruder (1970). In later life, Durfee gave lectures on silent film and held retrospectives on her and her husband's pictures. She was surprised and excited by the renewed interest in silent film. Durfee died in Woodland Hills, California, at the Motion Picture Country Home in 1975. She suffered from a heart ailment. ==Filmography== *His Sister's Kids (1913, Short) (uncredited) *Fatty's Day Off (1913, Short) *A Quiet Little Wedding (1913, Short) as Fatty's fianc√©e *Fatty at San Diego (1913, Short) as Girl at the carnival *Wine (1913, Short) as Diner's sweetheart *Fatty Joins the Force (1913, Short) (uncredited) *Fatty's Flirtation (1913, Short) as Minta *Ambrose's First Falsehood (1914, Short) (uncredited) *A Misplaced Foot (1914, Short) *The Under-Sheriff (1914, Short) as The Sheriff's Wife *A Flirt's Mistake (1914, Short) (uncredited) *Rebecca's Wedding Day (1914, Short) as Wedding guest (uncredited) *Making a Living (1914, Short) as Girl (uncredited) *Tango Tangles (1914, Short) as Guest *Cruel, Cruel Love (1914, Short) as The Lady *The Star Boarder (1914, Short) as Landlady *Twenty Minutes of Love (1914, Short) as Edgar's girl *Where Hazel Met the Villain (1914, Short) *Caught in a Cabaret (1914, Short) as Cabaret patron / Girl in park (uncredited) *A Suspended Ordeal (1914, Short) *The Water Dog (1914, Short) as Nursemaid *The Alarm (1914, Short) *The Knockout (1914, Short) as Pug's sweetheart (uncredited) *Fatty and the Heiress (1914, Short) *Fatty's Finish (1914, Short) *The Sky Pirate (1914, Short) *Those Happy Days (1914, Short) *Fatty's Gift (1914, Short) as Fatty's Wife *The Masquerader (1914, Short) as leading lady *His New Profession (1914, Short) *The Rounders (1914, Short) as Fatty's wife *Lover's Luck (1914, Short) as The Girl *Fatty's Debut (1914, Short) *Fatty Again (1914, Short) as Proprietor's daughter *Lovers' Post Office (1914, Short) as Fatty's sweetheart *An Incompetent Hero (1914, Short) as Neighbor's maid *Tillie's Punctured Romance (1914) as Maid (uncredited) *Fatty's Wine Party (1914, Short) as in a minor role (uncredited) *Leading Lizzie Astray (1914, Short) as Lizzie, the farm boy's fianc√©e *Fatty's Magic Pants (1914, Short) as Fatty's sweetheart *Fatty and Minnie He-Haw (1914, Short) as Minta *Dirty Work in a Laundry (1915, Short) (uncredited) *A Bird's a Bird (1915, Short) (uncredited) *Fatty and Mabel at the San Diego Exposition (1915, Short) as Jealous husband's wife (uncredited) *Mabel, Fatty and the Law (1915, Short) as Flirty wife *Fatty's Reckless Fling (1915, Short) as Neighbor's wife *Fatty's Faithful Fido (1915, Short) (uncredited) *Fatty's Chance Acquaintance (1915, Short) as Pickpocket's girlfriend *Fatty's Faithful Fido (1915, Short) as Fatty's sweetheart *When Love Took Wings (1915, Short) *Court House Crooks (1915, Short) as Judge's wife *Dirty Work in a Laundry (1915) *Fickle Fatty's Fall (1915, Short) as Fatty's wife *A Village Scandal (1915, Short) *Fatty and the Broadway Stars (1915, Short) as Sam Bernard's leading lady *Fatty and Mabel at the San Diego Exposition (1915, Short) (uncredited) *Bright Lights (1916, Short) in a minor role (uncredited) *His Wife's Mistakes (1916, Short) *The Other Man (1916, Short) *The Cabaret (1918) *Mickey (1918) as Elsie Drake *Skinner's Dress Suit (1926) as Party guest (uncredited) *Naughty Marietta (1935) in minor role (uncredited) *The Man with Nine Lives (1940) (uncredited) *Glamour for Sale (1940) as Matron (uncredited) *Rollin' Home to Texas (1940) (uncredited) *The Devil and Miss Jones (1941) as Customer (uncredited) *How Green Was My Valley (1941) in a minor role (uncredited) *The Miracle Kid (1941) as Pheney *The Man Who Returned to Life (1942) as Mrs. Tuller (uncredited) *Blondie for Victory (1942) as Housewife (uncredited) *The Chance of a Lifetime (1943) (uncredited) *Eve Knew Her Apples (1945) as Landlady (uncredited) *The Son of Rusty (1947) as Townswoman (uncredited) *My Dog Rusty (1948) as Mrs. Laura Foley (uncredited)Blottner, p. 283. *How to Be Very, Very Popular (1955) as Older Woman (uncredited) *Artists and Models (1955) as Dancer (uncredited) *Around the World in 80 Days (1956) as an extra (uncredited) *Hollywood or Bust (1956) as Miss Pettywood (uncredited) *The Buster Keaton Story (1957) as Boarder (uncredited) *An Affair to Remember (1957) as Ship passenger (uncredited) *Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?

It was built and operated by Bergen Sporvei, and is now operated by its successor, Tide Buss. As of 2007, it had six trolleybuses and two dual-mode buses. ==History== The first trolleybus network in Norway, in Drammen, opened in 1909. Planning for a trolleybus system began in Bergen in 1928, and in 1937 Bergen Sporvei, the company operating Bergen's tramway, began studying trolleybus systems around Europe. On July 7, 1940 the city council decided to build two trolleybus lines: Line 5, Mulen - city centre - M√∏hlenpris, and line 7, Nordnes - city centre - Fj√∏sangerveien. In 1942 Bergen Sporvei started converting some of its gasoline buses to trolleybuses, but in 1944 the German occupation forces took the completed bus and moved it to L√ºbeck, and the company stopped rebuilding. The fuel shortage during World War II made trolleybuses extremely popular, since Norway had an abundance of cheap electricity. After the war the construction of the 4.1-km line 5 started, and in 1950 it replaced tram line 3. By that time, five gasoline buses had been converted, giving a headway of 10 minutes. A year later, three more buses were bought from Str√∏mmens V√¶rksted and the headway was reduced to 7.5 minutes. The line was popular, and traffic increased. In 1954 the conversion of tram line 2 to trolleybus started, and in 1957 the 6.5-km line 2 opened with 18 new buses. The ridership reached its peak in 1959 with more than ten million passengers per year on the two routes. In 1960 the sale of cars in Norway was deregulated, resulting in fewer public transport riders. Skoda 9Tr, in service in Bergen from 1973 to 1986. Through the 1970s Bergen Sporvei tried to end trolleybus operation, but the city council would not allow that. However, in 1995 there was major road works resulting in the closure of line 5. As of 2007 line 5 was still closed, leaving line 2 the only trolleybus line in Norway. Plans related to the new Bergen Light Rail system involve expanding the trolleybus line from M√∏hlenpris to Oasen and from Mulen to Paradis. In 2019, ten trolleybusses were ordered for NOK 80 million, each with 55 kWh battery.

The island is uninhabited, with a surface area of approximately 18 hectares (44 acres), a length of , and a maximum width of . The island features a fine sandy beach facing Saint-Malo on the south, and a steep and rocky coast around the rest of the island. As elsewhere in northern Brittany, the tidal range is among the highest in the world. Until the seventeenth century it was possible to reach the island at low tide on foot from Saint Malo. The island's beach is popular in summer with visitors arriving by yacht or motorboat and there are infrequent excursions from St-Malo, although landing is not possible except at high tide. A small restaurant serves lunches and prebooking is essential. C√©zembre was inhabited by a number of hermits over the centuries, and featured a monastery for a time. There were also five small chapels. Vauban fortified the island at the end of the seventeenth century, and it was used thereafter as a place of quarantine. During World War I, the Belgian Army installed a disciplinary company on C√©zembre. ==World War Two== During World War II, the Germans and Italians strengthened the island's fortifications as part of the Atlantic Wall. The Italian contingent was made up of two officers and just over one hundred sailors, included in the Divisione Atlantica of the Repubblica Sociale Italiana. The Normandy campaign in the summer of 1944 saw the German-Italian garrison heavily bombarded by land artillery, naval artillery, and air strikes. Guns on the island contributed to the defense of St. Malo. The island's three-hundred-man garrison eventually surrendered to elements of the U.S. 83rd Infantry Division on 2 September 1944. ==Post-war== As a result of this intense Allied bombardment, C√©zembre's landscape is barren and pitted, although natural vegetation is returning. The island has not yet been completely demined, and for this reason most of the island other than the beach constitutes a zone interdite (prohibited zone), with a barbed-wire fence and warning notices. The micronation of Talossa claims C√©zembre as part of its territory (a \\"colony\\" in Talossan since the 1980's, that Talossa says was occupied by France and then claimed again to become one of its \\"provinces\\"). In fact the island has always been part of France since the union with Britanny, and was inhabited or used by Breton inhabitants until the end of World War 2 where it was highly bombarded before being liberated along with the rest of Saint-Malo and Britanny. It is a plain part of Saint-Malo, and reachable by pedestrian from the beach. The prohibited zone has created a natural area under protection and only the beach in the allowed zone can be visited. Talossa claims that barbed-wire fence and warning notices are creating a border when it fact it only constitutes a personal protection for safety, and for the local ecosystem (notably sea birds, and maritime plants) that has developed locally since the island is no longer inhabitable. Due to the protection, no economic development and establishment of residence is possible, and the island is also a property of the state, and visited regularly by scientists, French rescuers, so it was never left abandoned by France, even during WW2 when it was occupied by the German army. The island is also fully within the territorial waters of France and the small maritime area (possibly uncovered at low tide by a sand bank) between the island and the continent is part of the interior waters of France. The coasts of the island is also open to pedestrian fishing. After demining operations, the management of the island was transferred from the French ministry of Defense to the Conservatoire du littoral (an official French public operator) in October 2017, in order to further expand its natural protection and manage the historic and archaeology sites left on the island, including the ruins of chapels and burial sites. ==See also== *C√©zembre Point == References == ==External links== * More information on the island of C√©zembre * Page on C√©zembre from the Regional Council of Brittany * The official website of Talossa * Article about C√©zembre by Italian magazine \\"L'Espresso\\" * The German bunkers built on C√©zembre Category:Saint-Malo Islands Category:Uninhabited islands of France Category:Former populated places in France ","title":"C√©zembre"},{"id":"9111604","text":"Aaron Matson Aaron Matson (1770 ‚Äì July 18, 1855) was a United States Representative from New Hampshire.

Joe: A Real American Hero toyline, comic books and animated series. He is the first character created by Devil's Due Publishing to be made into a G.I. Joe figure, and later brought into the new animated series. ==Profile== Kamakura is an apprentice to Snake Eyes and a character of the G.I. Joe comic book series. His file cards list his true name and birthplace as classified. In comics by Devil's Due Publishing, he is revealed to be Sean Collins (Broca), the son of the original Fred Broca, a Crimson Guardsman who looked exactly like the rest of the \\"Fred series\\". His father is killed and later replaced by Fred II, who is later revealed to be Wade Collins, a war buddy of Snake Eyes and Stalker. Kamakura appeared in the Marvel Comics stories as Sean Broca, but did not become a ninja until the \\"Master & Apprentice\\" miniseries. He is a member of the Arashikage clan (as noted by the tattoo on his arm). ==Toys== Kamakura was the first character created by Devil's Due Publishing to be made into a figure by Hasbro in 2003. Since then, he has had four figures made in the 3\\" line. He is a ninja and is packed with an assortment of ninja weapons and an uzi machine gun. As his real name is listed as classified, his face has not been revealed on any of his figures. This is very similar to his master, Snake Eyes. In the Valor versus Venom line he was included with an uzi. ===The Rise of Cobra=== A new Kamakura figure was released in the fall of 2009 as part of the G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra toy line. ===G.I. Joe Retaliation=== A new Kamakura action figure was released in the Ninja Dojo 3 pack as part of the \\"G.I. Joe: Retaliation\\" toy line. ==ComicsMarvel Comics=== Kamakura never appeared during this series as a ninja. Instead, his youth was explored through his ties to Snake Eyes and his Vietnam buddy Wade Collins being involved in the Fred Series. Sean Collins was originally Sean Broca, the son of a Fred Series Crimson Guard. All of the Fred Series look alike and when he was killed in combat with G.I. Joe, Fred was later replaced by Fred II. This person was later revealed to be Wade Collins. In the last issue of the Marvel series, Sean writes Snake Eyes a letter to get his opinion on being a soldier, as Sean wants to enlist in the army when he turns 17. Snake Eyes writes him back, one of only two times the internal thoughts of Snake Eyes are revealed (the other being a recon report from issue 4). ===Devil's Due Publishing=== The Years In Between: Master & Apprentice It was revealed in this 4 issue miniseries \\"Master & Apprentice\\" that Sean joined the elite Hammer Team, a replacement for the deactivated G. I. Joe. During one of the first missions of the group, all but Sean are seemingly killed during an attack by the terrorist Firefly. In the same operation, the first new Arashikage student trained by Snake Eyes, Ophelia, was also killed. In response Snake Eyes leaves Scarlett on the day of their wedding and seeks solitude in his mountain cabin. Sean Collins finds him and requests that he trains him so that he can avenge Hammer Team. After a mission with Duke and Chuckles that results in Wade Collins' death (when Wade infiltrated a Cobra sleeper cell and helped shut it down), Sean takes the name Kamakura. Kamakura would later join G.I. Joe and would be the first character created by Devil's Due Publishing that would be made into a figure.G.I.

Later, Kamakura saves General Hawk's life by wounding Overkill, an enemy soldier who, earlier, personally killed three Joes.\\"G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero\\" #25 (Oct. 2003) Reinstatement - Devils Due His first appearance in the comic series is when he spies on the Everglades compound of the Dreadnoks for the benefit of his sensei, the 'Silent Master', a man later revealed to be Snake Eyes. His intelligence show Cobra operatives working with the wide-ranging biker bang. Kamakura is later seen as one of the new recruits to the Joe team, standing side-by-side with other new Joes; they are commonly called 'Greenshirts'. General Hawk expresses concern at Kamakura at first, not wanting more of the 'Ninja Force' that the Joes had recruited earlier; he calls Kamakura the 'Green Power Ranger'. Duke vouches for him.\\"G.I. Joe: A Great American Hero\\" Vol2 #1 (2001) He is one of the participants in an attack on the Dreadnoks. The Joes lose several Greenshirts while many Cobra Vipers and Dreadnoks die; Kamakura personally kills at least two.\\"G.I. Joe: A Great American Hero\\" Vol2 #2 (2001) The Joe survivors and their Cobra prisoners become infected with microscopic nanites. Kamakura manages to escape this, as he was just out of range. He is sent with Spirit to recover Billy, the ninja son of Cobra Commander.\\"G.I. Joe: A Great American Hero\\" Vol2 #3 (2002) The trio rescue Snake Eyes and Scarlett from Cobra forces; they dress up like Iron Grenadiers to do so. Later, Kamakura is the main ninja for the Joe team for some time, as Snake Eyes is mysteriously AWOL and Storm Shadow is working for Cobra yet again. The latter attempts to penetrate Joe Headquarters and slay General Hawk. Kamakura, along with other Joes such as Flint, Shipwreck, Clutch, Beachhead, and many Greenshirts work together to stop him. Kamakura has several confrontations with Storm Shadow; at one point the ninja only wounds him instead of delivering a deadly blow. Unexpectedly, Snake Eyes does show up. This helps drive off Storm Shadow.\\"G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero\\" #9-10 (2002) America‚Äôs Elite - Devils Due After G.I. Joe is brought back to active duty as a much leaner team, Kamakura is set to reserve member status. However, after Snake Eyes is seemingly killed in a mission to save Scarlett, Kamakura is reactivated to serve with Storm Shadow, giving G.I. Joe two ninjas. He has since remained an active reservist throughout the recent missions, but has not gone on any side missions. After the mandatory time off as a result of the Rock being infiltrated by Cobra agents, Kamakura spent time with Snake Eyes trying in vain to convince Snake Eyes not to give up on his ninja training. When the active members return to duty after this break, Kamakura is again on reserves. ===IDW Publishing=== In 2009, IDW Publishing took over the license for G.I. Joe comics, and started a new series that continues where the Marvel Comics series ended, disregarding the Devil's Due series altogether. As a result, in this particular series, Sean Collins does not become Kamakura. Sean is reintroduced in issue #206, when Scarlett and Snake Eyes spot him on their way back to Fort Wadsworth, in full Army dress uniform and standing outside his former home. Scarlett comes up with a plan to get them inside, claiming they are investigating a possible hazardous material leak from the fort. Sean is able to sneak into his father's hidden basement, only to discover that the family living there now has been planted by Cobra, just as his family had been. He then goes back to the fort with the Joes, where he discusses his service in Afghanistan with the Joes, and reveals his findings from the basement.G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero #206 (August 2014) After Snake Eyes and Scarlett return from a mission in Dublin, Sean receives orders to report for inspector cadre at a new training facility in Texas. Disappointed that he will not be joining the Joes, Sean receives a gift of a commando dagger from Snake Eyes before departing. He also receives kisses from Scarlett and Cover Girl, much to Clutch's chagrin. However, the orders turn out to be false, as the C-130 transporting Sean lands at the Pit III instead, and he is indeed assigned to the Joes. Roadblock gives Sean a new code name, Throwdown.G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero #209 (November 2014) Throwdown's first mission with the Joes is to infiltrate a Revanche Robotics facility in the fictional country of Olliestan.G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero #210 (December 2014) However, during this mission, the team including Throwdown runs afoul of the Red Shadows working with Cobra on a giant robot, intended to be the Black Major's ultimate weapon.G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero #211 (January 2015) During the fighting, Throwdown's shirt is torn, revealing an Arashikage tattoo that indicates he has trained with the ninja clan. Meanwhile, the Joes back at the Pit have been attempting to use a revived Serpentor to gain access to secrets in the greater secret underground base to which the Pit was constructed adjacently. Having lost control of Serpentor, he deploys the base's own secret weapon - another giant robot - and sends it to Olliestan, where it destroys the Red Shadows' robot.G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero #212 (February 2015) Throwdown, disguised as a Toxo-Viper, infiltrates the robot controlled by Serpentor, and rides it all the way back to Utah. However, the robot is not shielded against atmospheric reentry, and Sean's helmet catches fire, causing severe burns to his face. As the robot returns to the Pit, Snake Eyes sacrifices himself to put an end to Serpentor. Emerging from the robot, the still-smoldering Throwdown puts on Snake Eyes' discarded mask.G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero #213 (March 2015) Sean's vocal chords are revealed to have been destroyed, and while he is recovering in the Pit's sick bay, Hawk offers him the opportunity to assume the Snake Eyes identity, in order to have Cobra continue believing the original is still alive. However, as a result, Sgt. Sean Collins is declared dead and buried in Arlington National Cemetery with full honors, although the Joes are not present at the sham funeral. This does have the side-effect of Cobra recognizing the former Fred II, Wade Collins, at Sean's funeral, and Firefly is sent to destroy the Collins' home. Meanwhile, Night Creepers are sent to Snake Eyes' cabin in the High Sierras.G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero #215 (May 2015) Sean, as Snake Eyes, succeeds in fighting off the Night Creepers with Scarlett's help, and uses the lone surviving Night Creeper to infiltrate Cobra's Silent Castle in Trans-Carpathia to send Cobra Commander a message that Snake Eyes could get to him at any time. Meanwhile, the rest of the Collins family escapes Firefly's attack thanks to Wade having an escape plan, and Wade correctly deduces that his adopted son is still alive.G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero #216 (June 2015) As Snake Eyes, Sean is sent back to Fort Wadsworth along with Scarlett.G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero #217 (July 2015) From there, he is sent to infiltrate Storm Shadow's secret water tower lair in Manhattan, where he is reunited with the former Cobra ninja, who previously trained him.G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero #219 (September 2015) ==Animated seriesValor vs. Venom=== G.I. Joe: Valor vs. Venom marks Kamakura's first appearance in animated form. Here he is seen as an apprentice to Snake Eyes with Jinx. He struggles to use his new sword throughout much of the movie, but by the end finally masters it. The sword is said to possess mystical properties and that only someone with exceptional skill and focus can use it. ===Ninja Battles=== In the direct to video animated feature G.I. Joe: Ninja Battles, Jinx and Kamakura assists Snake Eyes, Duke, and new apprentice Tiger Claw, in a battle against Storm Shadow and Cobra ninjas Slice, Slash, and Shadow Strike, at the forge of Arashikage Clan swordsmith Iron Master. ===Sigma Six=== Kamakura again makes his appearance as part of the G.I. Joe team in the Sigma 6 toy series. As of August 2008, he has had two 8\\" Sigma Six Commando Scale Figures. A major difference between his Sigma 6 and his previous releases is that the top of his face is uncovered for these figures. Kamakura has short brown hair and brown eyes. Kamakura is a ninja and a reservist member of the Sigma 6 team. In this series, both Jinx and Kamakura serve as Snake Eyes' apprentices. He is seen in several episodes in which he is still training as a ninja under Snake Eyes and is on the team during a battle between Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow. He is later injured and not seen active again until the second season. He was last seen as part of the team Firefly captured and later rescued by Duke as of the last airing of Season 2. ==Video games== Kamakura appears as a playable character in the video game G.I.

The area was first developed during the first half of the 19th century as Tipton became extensively developed for industry during the Industrial Revolution. St. Mark's parish church was built in 1849 to serve the newly developed area, and is still in existence today. A landmark in Ocker Hill was the Ocker Hill Power Station electric power station off Leabrook Road, which included three cooling towers. The cooling towers were recognisable for miles around, but they were levelled in 1985. Housing has since been built on the site. The original power station, fired by coal, opened in 1902 and closed in 1977. The town received a railway station in 1864, serving the short line between the Bloomfield area of Tipton and the township of Wednesbury. The station closed in 1890, only to re-open five years later. But the station closed again in 1916 as a wartime economy measure and never re-opened, though the line remained open to goods trains until 1981. The trackbed between Ocker Hill and Princes End was converted into a pedestrian walkway in 1988, in works which saw a tunnel infilled and a railway overbridge demolished. The final stub of the line, connecting Wednesbury to Ocker Hill Power Station, remained open until February 1991. The power station itself closed five years later. Ocker Hill has been served by a junior school since the 1850s, although the original building was replaced by the current one in the 1970s. The infant school dates from the 1930s. There was a secondary school at the site until the opening of Willingsworth High School in 1958 - this school became the RSA Academy in 2008. A landmark water pumping station, one of the first of its kind, was opened at Ocker Hill in 1784 to re-circulate water from the nearby Walsall Canal. The Ocker Hill Tunnel Branch brought water to the pumps through a tunnel. It was then pumped up the Ocker Hill Branch of the Birmingham Canal (the Wednesbury Oak Loop). It was in use for 164 years, finally closing in 1948. However, it was not demolished until 1960, when the site was cleared for the development of Bolton Court, a development of three multi-storey tower blocks as well as two maisonette blocks. The first tenants moved there in 1964 and the complex was completed in 1965. After the demolition of the nearby cooling towers, Bolton Court became been Ocker Hill's most recognisable and distinctive landmark. The first tower block was demolished in about 1990 to be replaced by low rise housing. The two maisonette blocks were demolished in 2007. The remaining two tower blocks were demolished in 2011. A reminder of the area's rural past survived until as recently as the 1920s. Moat Farm, situated to the west of Ocker Hill in the direction of Princes End, was built in the 17th century and stood for some 250 years until it was finally demolished to make way for the new Moat Farm council estate (nicknamed the \\"Lost City\\" as it was hemmed in by a railway, canal and acres of derelict land when first built) which was the birthplace of the former Wolverhampton Wanderers and England footballer Steve Bull in 1965. Moat Farm quickly earned its reputation as arguably Tipton's worst housing estate, but improvement took place in the 1990s which saw the existing properties modernised, while a few houses have been demolished since that time, as was the Drayton public house in about 1980, having only been built some 25 years earlier. The famous Tipton Harriers running team has a strong connection to the Ocker Hill area of the town: the Harrier public house, opened on Powis Avenue in the 1950s, was named in the team's honour. The Walsall Canal passes around the eastern side of Ocker Hill. Ocker Hill is referred to as \\"Ocker Bonk\\" in local dialect, the word \\"bonk\\" meaning \\"bank.\\" ==References== Category:Tipton ","title":"Ocker Hill"},{"id":"9111660","text":"Ablass√© Ou√©drago (born 30 June 1953 in Dabar√©) is a Burkinab√© economist, diplomat and politician. From March 1994 to February 1999, Ou√©draogo served as Minister of Foreign Affairs for Burkina Faso. From February to November 1999, he served as Special Advisor to the President of Burkina Faso. In those positions, he helped influence the country's foreign policy. He is the founder and current president of the Faso Autrement party. In December 2012, Ou√©drago was elected to the Burkina Faso National Party. ==Early years and education== Ou√©draogo was born on 30 June 1953 in Dabar√©, Pabr√© Department, in the province of Kadiogo in Burkina Faso. Drawing on an impressive career in development, diplomacy and politics, he is the current President of the Faso Autrement (Faso Reimagined) Party, and a candidate in the presidential elections taking place on 29 November 2015. Ou√©drago is the founder of the liberal centrist Faso Autrement Party, which obtained its receipt of legal existence on 12 September 2011. Its motto is: ‚ÄúNothing stops an idea whose time has come.‚Äù The son of a farmer, Ou√©drago is a member of the Mossi ethnic group and is Muslim by religion. He attended the Cercle de Bouss√© public primary school before completing his secondary education at the Lyc√©e Philippe Zinda Kabor√© in Ouagadougou. Holder of a Baccalaureate in economics, Ou√©drago received a scholarship from the Association of African Universities to study economics at the National University of Gabon, in Libreville, from 1973 to 1975. Upon obtaining his degree, he enrolled in the University of Nice in France to pursue further study in economics from 1975 to 1981. He would go on to defend his doctorate in economic sciences with a specialization in development economics, for which he earned high honors and special jury commendation on 15 December 1981. His dissertation examined ‚ÄúMultinational firms and the industrialization of developing countries.‚Äù Returning home in January 1982, Ou√©drago taught economics at the Ecole Sup√©rieure des Sciences Economiques (ESSEC, known today as UFR-SEG) of University of Ouagadougou from January to July 1982, before embarking on a career in the international arena. ==Political career== Participation in government Ou√©drago served first as Minister of Foreign Affairs for Burkina Faso from March 1994 to February 1999, then as Special Advisor to the President of Burkina Faso from February to November 1999. From these positions, he orchestrated the strategic reorientation of the country's foreign policy through the development and implementation of the concept of ‚Äúdevelopment diplomacy.‚Äù This approach, on the one hand, enabled the channeling of greater resources toward development and stimulation of the local economy, and, on the other, helped raise the country's profile as a safe haven, solidifying Burkina Faso's place in the community of nations at global, continental and sub-regional levels. This allowed Burkina Faso to gain, among other notable achievements, the Presidency of the Organization of African Unity for the first time in 1998 ‚Äì 1999. The country also has hosted numerous marquee international events, such as the Summit of Heads of State and Government of Africa and France in December 1996, the African Cup of Nations in February 1998, and the AU Summit of Heads of State and Government in July 1998, as well as other large ministerial conferences of various sectors. Ou√©drago also has been a major player in peace and development efforts throughout Africa, notably contributing to the resolution of the Tuareg rebellion in Niger and Mali, and helping to bring an end to conflicts in Liberia, Guinea-Bissau, Sierra Leone and Burundi, as well as between Ethiopia and Eritrea during a particularly turbulent period. Entry into the Burkinab√© political opposition Taking note of the excesses of the regime of President Blaise Compaor√©, and wishing to make a positive contribution, Ou√©drago decided to make his official entry into politics by joining the ranks of the opposition. He founded his own party, Faso Autrement (Faso Reimagined), with a liberal centrist ideology, in June 2011. In so doing, Ou√©drago envisaged the political, economic and social transformation of a Burkina Faso united and reimagined, one that would strive for socioeconomic progress for all in a stable and secure environment. At the core of this strategy was the development of human capital for inclusive growth and sustainable development for all Burkinab√©, with a more just and equitable distribution of the fruits of growth and development. In December 2012, Ou√©drago was elected for the first time as Member of Parliament to the Burkina Faso National Assembly in the Fifth Legislature of the Fourth Republic, representing for that half-term his newly created party. In this capacity, he helped to improve operations of the legislature and to strengthen policy debate among Parliamentarians, through the interventions of the Burkinab√© political opposition. Ou√©drago also played a significant and decisive role in combating the modification to Article 37 of the Burkinab√© Constitution governing presidential term limits. He served as national coordinator of the political opposition protests in Ouagadougou, including the last and most memorable protest of Tuesday 28 October 2014. Popular insurrection of 30 ‚Äì 31 October 2014 Ou√©drago was front and center in the management of the political crisis of 30 ‚Äì 31 October 2014, which brought an end to the 27-year regime of President Blaise Compaor√©. Overnight, the country entered a 12-month period of transition, with the goal of organizing fair, free and transparent legislative and presidential elections on 11 October 2015, in response to the call of the Burkinab√© people for turnover and change. His key role in the management of the crisis and in the implementation of the political transition demonstrated his capacities as leader and steward of the nation's interests in preserving social peace, stability and security. Ou√©drago was noted for facilitating and participating in the drafting of the Transition Charter. He led essential consultations and mediations with major stakeholders in the crisis, and engaged with facilitators from the international community. This allowed for the restoration, in the brief span of 15 days, of Constitutional order and stability in the country. In addition to serving as Co-Rapporteur of the Drafting Commission of the Transition Charter, Ou√©drago was a member of the College for Appointing the President of the Transition. In June 2015, Ou√©drago was tapped by Faso Autrement to take his social project forward into the presidential race, and to lead his team to the conquest of the National Assembly. In September 2015, Ou√©drago once again demonstrated his considerable mediation and conflict management skills by contributing to the successful effort to preserve peace and stability in Burkina Faso following the failed coup d‚Äô√©tat on 17 September 2015 staged by the former Regiment of Presidential Security (ex-RSP). A man of unity, reconciliation, tolerance and forgiveness, he strove to defuse tensions, thereby helping to avoid confrontation among the military factions and avert chaos. ==International career== In the international arena, Ou√©drago has served in various high-level functions in which, once again, he has been called upon to manage crises and quell conflicts, all while working for the furtherance of development and for the maintenance of peace and security. From 1982 to 1994, Ou√©drago worked for the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), where he served, successively, as Deputy Administrator for the United Nations Organization for Industrial Development in Niamey, Niger, from 1982 to 1984; Head of Programme in Conakry, Guinea, from 1984 to 1986; Deputy Resident Representative to the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, from 1986 to 1988; Resident Representative a.i. in Brazzaville, Congo, from 1988 to 1991; Deputy Resident Representative in Kinshasa, Zaire (now Democratic Republic of Congo) and Regional Director for East Africa of the United Nations Office for the Sudan-Sahel Region (UNSO) in Nairobi, Kenya. During this period, Ou√©drago contributed to the implementation of several multi-sectorial development programmes, in addition to participating in the negotiation process that led to the independence of Namibia and in the mediation for the restoration of peace and stability in Zaire in the early 1990s. From 1999 to 2002, Ou√©drago was the first African to serve as Deputy Director-General of the World Trade Organization (WTO). During his term, he successfully ushered Africa to the WTO and the WTO to Africa. In November 2000, he organized the first-ever conference for African Ministers of Trade in Libreville, Gabon, under the auspices of the WTO. He also has presented at various major forums on matters of development and trade during the WTO Ministerial Conferences in Seattle in November 1999 and Doha in November 2001, and at the International Conference on Financing for Development held at Monterrey in March 2002. From December 2003 to July 2007, Ou√©drago served as Senior Adviser for Africa to the President of the African Development Bank Group (ADB). In this capacity, he represented the ADB Group among the peace negotiators in Darfur, assuming the role of President of the Wealth Sharing Commission. The negotiations resulted in the signing of the Darfur Peace Agreement on 5 May 2006 in Abuja, Nigeria. From August 2007 to June 2008, Ou√©drago was Special Adviser to the President of the Commission of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) for trade negotiations. In this role, he contributed to negotiations on the Economic Partnership Agreements between the European Union and ECOWAS, and also advocated on behalf of cotton-producing countries during multilateral negotiations at the WTO. Between 2008 and 2009, Ou√©drago participated in several interventions on behalf of the President of the African Union Commission in the negotiations between Chad and Sudan, which helped renew social and diplomatic relations between the two countries. From February to December 2009, Ou√©drago was Special Envoy of the President of the African Union Commission to Madagascar. At his urging, the key players in the Malagasy crisis signed, on 6 November 2009 at the African Union Commission's Addis Ababa headquarters, the Additional Act of Addis Ababa to the Malagasy Charter of the Transition, which had been signed on 9 August 2009 in Maputo, Mozambique. This Additional Act settled the matter of the sharing of power. ==Private sector, education and research engagements== Ou√©drago is an active consultant on international matters, road safety and the recreation industry. He is the General Administrator of ZOODO International, an international and strategic relations consulting firm that he created in 2008. He lent his expertise on cultural diversity to the International Organization of the Francophonie (OIF) in the preparation and adoption of the UNESCO International Convention on Cultural Diversity in 2003. A great lover and defender of culture, Ou√©drago has been active in promoting the musical arts, organizing a Burkinab√© Music Summit in September 2011. He also has collaborated with musicians in composing musical works, including most recently the Party anthem, ‚ÄúFaso Autrement.‚Äù His involvement in education, training and research is evident in his university- level teaching, notably in his participation in the Administrative Council of the International Centre for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) from July 2007 to August 2008. In this context, he has promoted agricultural research in Africa. Additionally, from September 2010 to June 2013, he served as President of the Administrative Council for the New Inter-University Third Cycle in Economics for universities in Central and West Africa. Advancing the development of rural communities Ou√©drago has worked tirelessly to promote the self- determination of rural populations, with a focus on expanding village access to water, solar energy and health services. Appreciating first-hand the values of education and work, he has encouraged and promoted access to public and religious schools for rural communities, prioritizing youth access to culture. Ou√©drago believes that each young person, through education and work, can create his or her own future and contribute to the country's development.

C. Kumarappa (born Joseph Chelladurai Cornelius) (4 January 1892 ‚Äì 30 January 1960) was an Indian economist and a close associate of Mahatma Gandhi. A pioneer of rural economic development theories, Kumarappa is credited for developing economic theories based on Gandhism ‚Äì a school of economic thought he coined \\"Gandhian economics.\\" The Hindu ‚Äì Jan 2003 Indian express ‚Äì Jan 2010 ==Early life and studies== Joseph Chelladurai Kumarappa was born on 4 January 1892 in Tanjore, present-day Tamil Nadu, into a Christian family.Kumarappa Institute of Gram Samaj: www.kigs.org He was the sixth child of Solomon Doraisamy Cornelius, a Public Works officer, and Esther Rajanayagam. S.D. Cornelius, being one of the great old boys of William Miller, the famous Principal of Madras Christian College, sent his illustrious sons JC Cornelius and Benjamin Cornelius to Doveton School and later on to Madras Christian College. After becoming the followers of Gandhi, both these brothers adopt their grand father's name--Kumarappa--and hailed as Kumarappa brothers. (For biographical details see The Gandhian Crusader: A Biography of Dr. J.C.Kumarappa, Gandhigram Trust, 1956 (rev.1987).J C Kumarappa later on did economics and chartered accountancy in Britain in 1919. In 1928 he travelled to the United States to obtain degrees in economics and business administration at Syracuse University and Columbia University, studying under Edwin Robert Anderson Seligman. Down To Earth ‚Äì Mar 1993 His older sister, E. S. Appasamy, became a notable educator and social worker in Madras.Sita Anantha Raman, Crossing Cultural Boundaries: Indian Matriarchs and Sisters in Service, Journal of Third World Studies 18, no. 2 (Fall 2001): 131‚Äì48. via ProQuest ==Gandhian economics== On his return to India, Kumarappa published an article on the British tax policy and its exploitation of the Indian economy. He met Gandhi in 1929. At Gandhi's request he prepared an economic survey of rural Gujarat, which he published as A Survey of Matar Taluka in the Kheda District (1931). He strongly supported Gandhi's notion of village industries and promoted Village Industries Associations. Kumarappa worked to combine Christian and Gandhian values of \\"trusteeship\\", non-violence and a focus on human dignity and development in place of materialism as the basis of his economic theories. While rejecting socialism's emphasis on class war and force in implementation, he also rejected the emphasis on material development, competition and efficiency in free-market economics. Gandhi and Kumarappa envisioned an economy focused on satisfying human needs and challenges while rooting out socio-economic conflict, unemployment, poverty and deprivation. He was described by M. M. Thomas as one of the \\"Christians of the inner Gandhi circle\\" ‚Äì which included non-Indians such as Charles Freer Andrews, Verrier Elwin and R. R. Keithahn, and Indians such as Rajkumari Amrit Kaur, S. K. George, Aryanayagam and B. Kumarappa, all of whom espoused the philosophy of non-violence.M.M. Thomas, The Acknowledged Christ of the Indian Renaissance (1969), p.215 J. C. Kumarappa responded positively to the Indian national renaissance, and he and George rejected the idea that British rule in India was ordained by divine providenceM. M. Thomas, The Acknowledged Christ of the Indian Renaissance (1969), p.240, 243 Kumarappa worked as a professor of economics at the Gujarat Vidyapith in Ahmedabad, while serving as the editor of Young India during the Salt Satyagraha, between May 1930 and February 1931. He helped found and organise the All India Village Industries Association in 1935; and was imprisoned for more than a year during the Quit India movement. Building a Creative Freedom : J C Kumarappa & his Economic Philosophy He wrote during his imprisonment, Economy of Permanence, The Practice and Precepts of Jesus (1945) and Christianity: Its Economy and Way of Life (1945). ==Environmentalism== Several of Gandhi's followers developed a theory of environmentalism. Kumarappa took the lead in a number of relevant books in the 1930s and 1940s. He and Mirabehn argued against large-scale dam-and-irrigation projects, saying that small projects were more efficacious, that organic manure was better and less dangerous than man-made chemicals, and that forests should be managed with the goal of water conservation rather than revenue maximisation. The British and the Nehru governments paid them little attention. Historian Ramachandra Guha calls Kumarappa, \\"The Green Gandhian,\\" portraying him as the founder of modern environmentalism in India. ==Later life== After India's independence in 1947, Kumarappa worked for the Planning Commission of India and the Indian National Congress to develop national policies for agriculture and rural development. He also travelled to China, eastern Europe and Japan on diplomatic assignments and to study their rural economic systems. He spent some time in Sri Lanka, where he received Ayurvedic treatment.Victus, Solomon, Religion and Eco-Economics of J.C.Kumarappa,2003, pxxx He settled near Madurai at the Gandhi Niketan Ashram, T.Kallupatti (a school based on Gandhian education system) constructed by freedom fighter and Gandhian follower K. Venkatachalapathi, where he continued his work in economics and writing. He died on 30 January 1960, the 12th death anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, aged 68. After his death the Kumarappa Institute of Gram Swaraj was founded in his honour. His younger brother Bharatan Kumarappa was also associated with Gandhi and the Sarvodaya movement. ==Select works by Kumarappa== * Public Finance and Our Poverty; Navajivan, Ahmedabad; 1930, pages: 110 * Christianity: Its Economy and Way of Life; Navajivan, Ahmedabad; 1945, pages: 124. * Grinding of Cereals; Maganwadi, Wardha; 1947, pages: 15 * Village Industries; Maganwadi, Wardha; 1947, pages: 72. * Clive to Keynes; Navajivan, Ahmedabad; 1947, pages: 44. * Swaraj for the Masses; Hind Kitab Ltd.

The puzzle has four sides, each depicting a chain of a different color. Each side contains four tiles, except one which contains three tiles and a gap. The top and bottom rows can be rotated, and tiles can slide up or down into the gap. The objective is to scramble the tiles and then restore them to their original configuration. The two middle rows cannot be rotated. To move tiles in these rows, you need to loop the tiles from one row to another, up and down. There are 15 tiles and a gap, giving a maximum of 16! arrangements. However, the middle tiles of each four-tile chain are identical, and each position is equivalent to seven other positions obtained by rotating the entire puzzle (about its axis or upside- down), reducing the number of arrangements to 16! / 8 / 8 = 326,918,592,000. If the three long chains are also considered interchangeable, then the number of arrangements is further reduced to 16! / 8 / 8 / 6 = 54,486,432,000. ==See also== *Combination puzzles *Mechanical puzzles ==External links== *Picture and solution Category:1980s toys Category:1981 introductions Category:1981 works Category:Combination puzzles Category:Mechanical puzzles ","title":"Missing Link (puzzle)"},{"id":"9111718","text":"Performance test or performance testing may refer to: * Performance test (assessment), an assessment requiring the subject to perform a task or activity * Performance test (bar exam), a section of the bar exam simulating a real-life legal task * Software performance testing, a procedure to determine how a system performs under a particular workload == See also== * Performance (disambiguation) ","title":"Performance testing"},{"id":"9111753","text":"Secrets is the fifth solo album by Robert Palmer, released in 1979.

The Okinawan culture is noted for extreme diversity. The following list is based on south-central Okinawa, and may not be applied to northern Okinawa. Miyako and Yaeyama hold substantially different festivals and observances. Unless otherwise noted, dates are according to the traditional lunisolar calendar. The categories below (\\"January - May\\" and \\"June - December\\") are artificial, created for ease of article navigation. ==January - May observances== *31 December (solar calendar): Tusinuyuru (New Year's Eve). Amid celebration, garlic is used in different ways (according to local tradition) to banish and keep away evil spirits. 'Wakamizi, the year's first drawn water, is set out as an offering to ancestors. *1 January (solar calendar): Sjoogwachi, (Standard Japanese: Sh≈çgatsu; New Year's Day). Local religious leaders hold first rites of the New Year. Heads of household or first sons visit relatives and the elderly to present gifts. In the homes of senior citizens, a cup of awamori is enjoyed for good luck; in some places, slices of dried squid and salt are eaten. When visiting the heads of one's family, incense is offered to ancestors. Male members traditionally make these visits; however, these days wives and children may go along as well. Most people also visit a Shinto shrine (jinja) around this time of year to make a New Year's wish and draw a New Year's fortune (omikuji) to find out about their luck in the coming year; other common Japanese New Year traditions are upheld. *4 January: Hwinukan mukee. The hwinukan goes away from the kitchen and back to his own home from December 24 to 3 January. Matrons burn incense and make offerings (awamori, rice) at the kitchen hearth to welcome him home. Especially popular on the main island. *16 January: Zuuruku Nichi (Ancestors at the New Year). One of many holidays on which extend families gather at their tomb to make offerings (flowers, incense, awamori, food) and prayers, as well as to have a picnic and commune in the presence of their ancestors. *Early February: Simakusarasi (Purification of the Village). Especially popular in southern Okinawa. A cow is slaughtered, and its various parts used to ritually cleanse the community. The cow's blood is smeared with leaves onto walls and gates. Then the heart is boiled and presented at an utaki, ancient tombs, or the house of an especially old or powerful family. A rope, particularly a straw rope, is hung over paths at the edge of town to mark the reaches of the community's sanctuary and keep out evil influences. Bones of the cow are then tied to the string and the cow's meat is given out for communal consumption. *3 March (solar calendar): Hama îuri (Purification at the Beach). A holiday for girls and women, they often walk along the beach, and families collect shells. This is based upon the belief that walking on white sand is purifying. Some also believe that bad omens can be ignored if one walks beside the sea. Mugwort and rice cakes are eaten on this day. *Early April (solar calendar): Siimii (Chin. Qing-Ming). Another Okinawan visitation of the ancestors' at the family tomb. Held at this time to appropriately begin spring and the year's agricultural work. Also celebrated is kami-usiimii, when family heads of a widely extended family all gather to commune with their common ancestors. *14 April:  îabusibaree (Ritual to Ward Off Pests). Grass is cut along the edges of fields; rats and insects are caught, put aboard small boats, and ritually set out to sea. *Late April/Early May: Jamadumi (Taboo Against Loud Noise). Between April and May, it was forbidden to make loud noises (thus cut down trees). People believed the noise would cause wind that would destroy the crops; while the noise wouldn't cause the wind, the cutting down of trees would have destroyed natural windbreaks that truly did keep the crops safe. *May 4: Jukkanuhwii, Haarii/Haarei Races (Dragon Boat Races). Teams of local men race dragon-shaped boats amid rituals of tribute to sea gods. Boat races in connection with prayers to ensure good fishing have been staged since the 14th century, and today's races arose from the mixing of two traditions: the fishermen's races on the sea and the dragon boat ceremonies performed on rivers and lakes in China. Traditionally the races are held on the fourth day of the fifth lunar month, but in Naha they are now staged on May 4 (solar calendar), to match the tourist season of \\"Golden Week\\". The largest races are in Naha, Itoman, and Tamagusuku; similar races are also held on any of the islands where people from Okinawa Island have settled (Yonaguni, Ishigaki, etc.). ==June - December observances== *June: Umachii/Sichuma/Sikjoma/Awa Sichuma (Harvest Festivals/Millet Festivals). Families pray together giving thanks for a good harvest and seeking future prosperity. *June 25: Kasichii (Rice Offering to Ancestors). Rice steamed with red beans and offered to ancestors as thanks for a good harvest. Also may be celebrated in August. *July: Sichigwachi Sichigwachi, or \\"Seventh Month\\", is the Ghost Month marked with a midmonth veneration of the dead (v.s.). Marital rites and other celebrations are tabboo during lunar July due to its rituals involving the presence of the dead. *July: Sinugu (\\"for men and brothers\\"). Somewhat similar to Miyako-jima's PƒÅntu rite. At Ada near Kunigami Village in the northern part of Okinawa, males climb up into the mountains and pray to the mountain gods for prosperity and a good harvest. They also face the direction of the sea and call upon the sea gods for the same. Then they ritually assume the godforms of mountain deities by covering themselves with leaves and crowning themselves with red flowers. They carry branches down into the community and together purify it by waving the branches over its borders and its fields. In a rite called sakankei, the men receive ritual libations as offerings to the gods whose forms they have assumed. *July:  îunjami/ îungami. At Shioya Bay, Ogimi Village in the northern part of Okinawa, priestesses invoke the gods of the sea for prosperity and good fishing. Some priestesses call to the gods from a place in a boat out on the water, and then assume the forms of the gods, much as the men of Kunigami assume the form of the mountain gods during Sinugu (v.s.). They return to the shore, greeted by other priestesses and hosted in a ritual tent. They make blessings and receive libation offerings, then visit area villages. Finally, the gods are seen off by local people who gather on the beach. *July 7: Tanabata. Wishes are written on strips of paper and hung from bamboo trees. Families also visit graves with offerings to invite ancestors to the following week's Obon. (Ooshiro 17) *July 13‚Äì15 or 16: Obon Festival featuring EisƒÅ dancing. During Obon, ancestors are believed to gather en masse with their living relatives. Prayers and offerings such as incense, food, alcohol, and flowers are all made three times a day. Like Siimii and New Year's Eve (v.s.), Obon is a significant holiday in the ancestors worship, and the attendance of members of extended families is almost required. The first day of Obon is called  îunkee. The family altar and memorial tablets cleaned and decked with incense, fruit, and sugarcane (uuzi) offerings. A simple offering of rice, beans, and water (minnukuu) is prepared for spirits who receive no regular attention and accompany ancestors into the home. Often offerings may spill over onto low tables set up in front of the buchidan. On the offerings may be placed a sangwaa. The family gate (zoo) is then lit with pine torch, candles, or incense. The second day (nakanuhwii) is rather uneventful. At close to midnight on the third day ( îuukui), people have a farewell gathering for their ancestors. A large meal with the best food is presented. Then incense and paper money called  îuchikabi (representing money for the world of the dead, like Chinese Joss paper or Hell Bank Notes) is burned. All remaining offerings are gathered and set outdoors, and ancestors are sent away. EisƒÅ dancing traditionally ends Obon, the drums sending the ancestors away with respect and blessings. (Ooshiro 17-18) *August: Shishimai Dances (\\"Lion Dances\\") at harvest festivals. At various midmonth festivals around the Okinawa Islands, shishimai dances are performed to consecrate the festival ground and open the festival. A wooden lion mask and wooly-looking costume of woven and dyed banana/choma strips is worn, and the dance is performed to loud music featuring gongs, drums, bells, flutes, sanshin, and various other instruments. Some lion dances feature two or more dancers as the lion. *August: Tugs-of-War. Midmonth August festivals often feature a communal tug-of-war using a giant fiber rope that can often take days to weave. The rope in Naha is over 200m long and weighs more than 40 metric tons. A similar tug-of-war takes place in Korea. *9 August - 15 August: Too Udui Dance (Tsuken Island, Katsuren). A men's circle dance of Chinese origin performed in traditional summer dress to the accompaniment of small hand-held drums. *10 August: Beginning of Yabu Dance Festival (near Nago). At this performance festival's roots are priestess prayers of thanks and hope concerning this year's harvest and that of the next. There are parades of dancers and various other folk performances, including formal Yotsudaki and Kumiodori dances. Similar dance festivals are held throughout Okinawa, notably on Ie-shima, who now celebrate after the harvest in November. *13 August and 15 August (every five years): Ayachi Shishi Marionette Performances at Jana (near Nakijin). A stage show is held, at the end of which a pair of shishi marionettes, a male and a female, dance and play together accompanied by sanshin and drumming. *15 August: Taa Faa Kuu Dance (in Iju in Nakagusuku). A dance of Chinese origin, performed originally at Kume but brought to Nakagusuku for performance during harvest. It is energetic and features Chinese-style costumes and props. *15 August: Masutoriya at Ueno. A traditional staff dance accompanied by harvest prayer. *September: Kami Ugami (prayer pilgrimages). During September, people visit various sacred sites to pay respects to famous kami. Especially popular are areas around Nakijin (Nakijin gusuku) and Shuri Castle. *13 November: Amidusi (\\"lowering the nets\\") fishing ritual on Kudaka. Priests and three priestesses pray and make offerings of alcohol and rice to sea gods in order to ensure good fishing. Seven temporary enclosures are built by the sea to provide shelter for the visiting gods. *15 November:  îizaihoo on Kudaka Island. No longer performed due to lack of women to take on priestess roles. Performed every twelve years during every Year of the Horse. A four-day, four- stage initiation ritual, ordaining all women of the island between 31 and 40 as priestesses (v.s.). *8 December: Muuchii (Standard Japanese: mochi) Offerings. Muuchii, or rice cakes wrapped in sannin leaves, are offered to signal the beginning of winter and pray for the health of the family. Where there are children, the muuchii are tied to strings and hung, the number of muuchii tied up being determined by the child's age. Where a child has been born that year, hachi muuchii is celebrated, when the parents visit their neighbors and family to give out muuchii. ==References== The information in this article is drawn primarily from Festivals and Rituals of Okinawa, a site run by the Okinawa Prefectural government.

Shriya Saran, Prabhu, Krishna, Ashish Vidyarthi, and Vadivelu form the pivotal cast. It is the first Tamil superhero movie. The film's soundtrack and background score were composed by Devi Sri Prasad. The film's soundtrack was released on 17 May 2009 and the film was released on 21 August 2009. The film was partially reshot in Telugu as Mallanna with Brahmanandam replacing Vadivelu.http://www.idlebrain.com/news/functions/muhurat- mallanna.htmlhttp://www.idlebrain.com/news/functions/pressmeet-mallanna.html It was remade in Bengali Bangladesh as Most Welcome, starring Ananta, Barsha. ==Plot== The film's plot revolves around Kanthaswamy (Vikram), a CBI economic offences wing officer, and his friends, granting the wishes of the needy who write letters to the great Lord Muruga temple by disguising Kanthaswamy as an anthropomorphic rooster. During a CBI raid, he discovers a stash of black money owned by Pallur Paramajothi Ponnusamy aka PPP (Ashish Vidyarthi), a rich, corrupted entrepreneur. PPP pretends to be paralyzed to escape questioning. PPP's daughter Subbulakshmi (Shriya Saran) is angered by the news that her father is paralyzed, so she goes after Kanthaswamy to seek revenge by pretending to be in love with him. Kanthaswamy, knowing her real intentions, plays along. This forms a cat-and-mouse chase between the two. In a comical role, Thengakadai Thenappan (Vadivelu) is also sought after by a local police inspector who tries to solve the mystery of \\"Lord Muruga saving the people\\". In a series of twist, the police inspector was able to bring out the truth that the CBI is involved in the role behind the secret work of helping the needy people, though he was not able to confirm it. Kanthaswamy finds Subbulakshmi's family bank account password in which the black money is illegally saved. He tricks Subbalakshmi into revealing the password and answers for the security questions indirectly. Kanthaswamy transfers the money to his account, which would be used for helping poor and needy people. In the end, PPP was paralyzed upon knowing that his black money was robbed and that there was zero balance in their account, where they had stored it. After that, Subbulakshmi and Kanthaswamy were married and living in northern India. Kanthaswamy saw some letters tied to a tree, just like the ones at the Lord Muruga temple. He reads one and puts it into his pocket with a secret smile, which meant that he will pursue being the anthropomorphic rooster again. ==Cast== * Vikram as Kanthaswamy IPS, Superintendent of Police in CBI * Prabhu as Parandhaman IPS, DIG in CBCID * Krishna as Krishna Rao IPS, Joint Director of CBI * Shriya Saran as Subbulakshmi Ponnusamy * Ashish Vidyarthi as Industrialist Pallur Paramajothi Ponnusamy (PPP), Subbulakshmi's father * Mukesh Tiwari as Industrialist Rajmohan * Y.

In January 2007, early reports suggested that Kalaipuli International were set to make a film starring Vikram directed by Susi Ganesan, titled Kanthaswamy for a release during Diwali 2007. Soon after the announcement Shriya Saran, who was acting in Sivaji: The Boss at the time was roped in to play the heroine. However, due to Vikram and Shriya's projects, the film was delayed and the first schedule was postponed to July 2007. The film's first photo shoot was carried out in June 2007 at Muthukadu near Chennai featuring the lead actors. The film began filming a pre-launch trailer, the first of its kind in Tamil cinema, to be screened at the launch, with Hari, Susi Ganesan and fashion designer Chetan travelling to Malaysia to look for Hollywood-inspired costumes. The inauguration of Kanthaswamy took place on 22 September 2007 at the Devi Paradise theatre in Chennai. For the event, a unique electronic invitation, made in China, was presented to guests who had been invited. The invitation was the size of a laptop and featured an 8-minute trailer of Kanthaswamy. Each invitation had cost about Rs. 15,000, making it the most expensive invitation in Indian film history. Following the launch ceremony, the team announced they had adopted two villages near Madurai; Sangampatti and Gandhi Nagar, to shoot in initially and then to provide basic amenities like school and proper roads among other things to the villagers for a year. The team, who were praised for their actions, were the first production team to take part in such activity in Tamil cinema. In November 2007, the shooting was halted temporarily due to an accident that occurred at the shooting spot at the Chennai Boat Club. Cameraman Ekambaram was canning the shots as per director Susi Ganesan's instructions when a pole erected on the sets unexpectedly fell on the director's head resulting in an injury. The film finished schedules at Italy, where the trailer was filmed as well as schedules in Tanzania, Kenya and Switzerland. During the production of the film, actor Raghuvaran died suddenly and hence subsequently, his role was replaced by Ashish Vidyarthi which also led to delay in the release of the film. A schedule in locations in Mexico was also held, after the team went location hunting there, with a song and several scenes canned. The film, initially described as a \\"hilarious comedy\\", was rumoured to be a remake of the American cult hit The Breakfast Club, however Susi Ganesan has claimed that the film has a more Robin Hood feel to it. ===Casting=== Following the announcement of the project, Shriya Saran was signed in February 2007, when she was in the middle of completing her other projects Sivaji: The Boss and Azhagiya Tamil Magan. In September 2007, with the release of the trailer several other artistes names were featured as supporting cast. Prominent supporting actor Raghuvaran was selected to play as Shriya's father and shot scenes in the role, before his unexpected death during the production of the film, subsequently, his role was replaced by Ashish Vidyarthi. Prabhu Ganesan was also added in a supporting role, as well as lesser established actors such as Vikram's father Vinod Raj, Y. G. Mahendran, Shiv, Arun Madhavan, Vinayak and Alex, whilst Mumaith Khan was assigned for an item number. Later on, veteran Telugu actor Krishna was signed to a role in the project as well as Indrajith who will do a villainous role in the film. Indrajith was selected for the role ahead of other prominent character actors Arjun Rampal, Irfan Khan and Suman. Along with the change of actor for Raghuvaran's role, Indrajith's role was taken by Mukesh Tiwari and the role created for Santhanam was deleted. Moreover, Vivek, who had featured in the original trailer, opted out and was replaced by Vadivelu. Mansoor Ali Khan took up a negative role in the film to make a comeback in acting. The producer of Kanthaswamy, Kalaipuli S. Dhanu and Susi Ganesan the director ensembled an experienced team to produce the film. Veterans Thotta Tharani, A. S. Laxmi Narayanan and Viveka between them, take care of the art direction, audiography and lyrics respectively. Devi Sri Prasad composed the music. While N. K. Ekambaram was assigned as the director of photography of the film, the film was edited by three film editors Praveen K. L., N. B. Srikanth and M. V. Rajesh. Kanal Kannan and Chatrapathy Shakthi are the fight masters for the film, whilst Mittra media are responsible for the publicity designs the film outputs, adding to their work with the trailer and the invitations. The film is co-produced, by Chennai businessmen, A. Paranthaman and A. K. Natraj along with Dhanu. ==Soundtrack== The film has seven songs composed by Devi Sri Prasad(DSP).

Additionally, the Telugu version Mallanna was granted a U/A certificate, with a few cuts from the Board. Certain theaters reduced 15 minutes of Brahmanandam's comedy from the Telugu version.http://www.idlebrain.com/movie/archive/mr-mallanna.html Due to Raghuvaran‚Äòs death, the release was postponed. ==ReceptionCritical response=== Kanthaswamy received mixed reviews from both the critics and audiences. Indiaglitz reviewed that \\"the movie was delight to watch and praised Shriya that as a cool cat, she plays a perfect foil to Vikram in the film\\". Sify also reviewed that \\"the movie was a roller coaster ride of pure unadulterated masala. It praised Vikram and Shriya saying while Vikram rocked and the film belongs to him, Shriya sizzled throughout and carried the glamorous role with √©lan and the attitude\\". Rediff gave the film 2.5/5 stars and commented: \\"Watch Kandhasamy for its beautiful locales, a ravishing heroine, and Vikram's smile but go with nil expectations as this particular super-hero doesn't have much to offer a discerning viewer\\". Behindwoods rated the film 2/5 and stated that it was \\"A hollow hype\\". Cinema Chaat gave the film 3.5/5 stars, and stated that \\"Kanthaswamy is not a great film, but instead serves as an excellent example of what might have been.\\" For the Telugu version Mallanna, Fullhyd.com gave the film a positive rating of 3.25/5, writing that \\"Well, it's been long since we saw the good guys consistently act much smarter than the bad guys. And for that alone, Mallanna comes out a winner.\\" Idlebrain gave the film a rating of two-and-a-half out of five and noted that \\"On a whole, Mallana is an example of what happens when popular screenplay goes wrong in any of Shankar‚Äôs movies\\". ===Box office=== The film collected 13.7 million in the UK. In Malaysia it collected a $1,077,658 in its total run. In Chennai box office it collected 72.8 million in seven weeks.

The remaining seven volumes appeared first in English between 1691 and 1694, prefaced with a letter claiming that they were translated from a discovered Italian manuscript. A French edition of the last seven volumes (with the first) was published in 1696‚Äì7 and asserting that it was a translation from the English.Rosalind Ballaster, 2005, Fables of the East: selected tales, 1662-1785, page 208 The eight volumes contain 644 letters. There has long been a controversy as to the authorship of the volumes subsequent to Marana's first. They have been attributed to many writers, most notably Robert Midgley and William Bradshaw, who produced the English translation.Paula R. Backscheider, Catherine Ingrassia, 2005, A companion to the eighteenth-century English novel and culture, page 58 However, given the similarities between the letters, and the stylistic coherence of the whole series, the likeliest author is Marana himself.Rosalind Ballaster, 2005, Fabulous orients: fictions of the East in England, 1662-1785, page 145 Marana may have had difficulty in getting the later volumes published in France and turned to England to secure their continuing appearance. The work was popular throughout the 18th century and went through fifteen complete editions by 1801. Daniel Defoe was attracted to the deist rationalist sympathies of the purported spy; his Continuation of Turkish Letters Writ by a Turkish Spy in Paris (1718) extended the narrator's account from 1687 to 1693. ==Content== The volumes contain fictional letters written by one \\"Mahmut the Arabian.\\"Paula R.

The Letters form a rambling journal of gossip on current politics and satire on society.Martha Pike Conant, 2009, The Oriental Tale in England in the Eighteenth Century, page 158 Mahmut sends reports from Paris to Constantinople on politics and current events in France, but corresponds privately on other subjects including religion, and adds stories and anecdotes for diversion. His observations range from those on political figures such as Richelieu and Mazarin to speculations on the status of women, advice about state policy, and major interventions in controversies about religious doctrine and their consequences.Paula R.

The station, established in 1934, was most recently owned by Community Broadcast Group Inc. and the broadcast license held by M.R.S. Ventures, Inc. When it signed off permanently in early 2007, it had been broadcasting a News/Talk/Sports format branded as \\"Information Radio\\". The station was assigned the KOTN call letters by the Federal Communications Commission. ==Ownership== KOTN had been on the air since 1934 and was one of south Arkansas' oldest stations. Buddy Deane bought the station in 1960 and moved from Baltimore, where he had hosted a dance-show known as The Buddy Deane Show, in 1964. (This show was parodied as the Corny Collins Show by John Waters in the film Hairspray.) He sold KOTN in 1983 but bought it back in 1995. Deane retired from broadcasting in May 2003 after completing the sale of his family's radio stations and died shortly thereafter in July 2003. In April 2002, Tyler, Texas based Community Broadcast Group Inc., through its MRS Ventures subsidiary, purchased four Pine Bluff radio stations from SeArk Radio and Delta Radio of Pine Bluff. SeArk Radio, owned by Dawn Deane, sold FM stations KPBQ-FM and KZYP plus AM station KCLA. Delta Radio, owned by W.M. \\"Buddy\\" and Helen Deane, sold AM station KOTN. KOTN sold for a reported for $350,000 and the other three sold for a combined $1.05 million. In June 2006, the station's owner, Jerry D. Russell, suffered a stroke. The station was being operated by another broadcaster, Hodges Broadcasting LLC, under a local marketing agreement but that operator was unable to obtain the financing to purchase the station. With Hodges gone and Russell unable to operate the station himself, KOTN went off the air for good in early 2007. In a February 2011 letter to the FCC, the owner indicated that he was surrendering the station's broadcast license as well as the licenses for ten sister stations in similar dire circumstances. On May 2, 2011, the station's license was cancelled and the KOTN call sign assignment was deleted permanently from the FCC database. ==References== ==External links== * OTN Category:Radio stations established in 1934 Category:Radio stations disestablished in 2011 Category:Jefferson County, Arkansas Category:Defunct radio stations in the United States Category:1934 establishments in Arkansas Category:2011 disestablishments in Arkansas OTN Category:Arkansas radio station stubs ","title":"KOTN (Pine Bluff, Arkansas)"},{"id":"9111824","text":"J√°n Slota, the chairman of Slovak government Party SNS, according to whom the Hungarian population of Slovakia \\"is cancer in the body of the Slovak nation.\\"Slovakia and Hungary just won't get along The Slovak‚ÄìHungarian diplomatic affairs of 2006 were a series of ethnic and diplomatic affairs between Slovakia and Hungary. ==Flag burning== The situation escalated further after the parliamentary elections in June 2006, after which the party of the Hungarian minority SMK was not invited into the new government coalition. After a series of bitter comments from both sides, a short movie presumably depicting a group of Slovak nationalists instigating against the Hungarian minority by burning the Hungarian flag appeared on YouTube.com, which at the day, when it has been announced, it has been removed from YouTube due to terms of use violation. A day later, anti-Slovak graffiti appeared on Slovakia's embassy in Budapest. ===Ethnic conflicts=== In August 2006 in a few days time the following incidents were reported: In Kom√°rno a man was severely beaten because he spoke Hungarian on the street. In the smaller towns of southern Slovakia a woman was allegedly harassed by the hospital staff because of the same reason. This was reported from Nov√© Z√°mky, ≈†aƒæa and Veƒæk√Ω Krt√≠≈°. In Nov√© Z√°mky a graffiti saying \\"Hungarians (should go) to the other side of Danube\\" appeared on a Hungarian family house. In Bratislava, the statue of S√°ndor Pet≈ëfi, the popular Hungarian poet (of Slovak origin), was damaged on August 24, which has happened many times in the past decades. According to B√©la Bug√°r, a politician of the SMK, such incidents weren't typical in the past 8 years (when his SMK was in the government), and the Slovak government has to take seriously the worsening ethnic tensions. After these incidents another film was uploaded to the Internet, which was made in April at a Slovak second division football match between Slovan and Dunajsk√° Streda, showing a Kingdom of Hungary map for some seconds, then it was creased and savaged, then started hailing Jan Slota and shouted \\"101% anti-Hungarian\\", \\"Slovakia is the Slovak's\\" and several fascist slogans. The attempt by the Hungarian diplomacy to delete it from the Internet was successful, but soon Slovak football fans protested against local Hungarians in Bratislava(Pozsony) with slogans: \\"Fucking Hungarians go home!\\" . After that there was an anti-Slovak protest as a response by football fans in Budapest (they said \\"Fucking Slovakia\\", \\"Slovaks, you will always remain our slaves\\", \\"Slota must die\\" ), six protesters were arrested. On August 25 an ethnic Hungarian female university student called Hedvig Malina was severely beaten and the statements \\"SK (probably means Slovakia) without parasites!\\", \\"Hungarians to the other side of the Danube!\\" was written on her clothes in the town of Nitra. On September 12, the police concluded that this was a staged attack what the girl denied. According to √öj Sz√≥, some pictures and more evidence was found and attempted to pass to the local police about the incident, but they refused to take them. According to this, a bit later, on a Bansk√° Bystrica football match a transparent was handed out, with \\"Death to the Hungarians!\\" written on it. On 26 August a 19-year-old Hungarian man was seriously beaten in Sladkoviƒçovo. According to Slovak sources this had no ethnic background, but was a usual crime. The victim said that before he was beaten the assailants asked him: \\"Do you know where J√°n Slota lives?\\" For a response on August 29, the statue of Friedrich Habsburg in Mosonmagyar√≥v√°r was damaged and an anti-Slovak graffiti appeared there. On August 29‚Äì31, several name tables of towns and villages inhabited by the Slovak minority in Hungary were destroyed or damaged. As a response to this series of attacks, the Slovak Police announced that it would use its special forces to fight political extremists. The deputy prime minister of the Slovak Republic Du≈°an ƒåaploviƒç officially met with B√©la Bug√°r to discuss the new measures against extremists and he publicly supported SMK- sponsored declaration against the recent violent attacks. In late August, several Slovak persons (football hooligans having held anti-Hungarian inscriptions) have been sentenced to prison in Slovakia for \\"inciting ethnic and racial hatred\\". In addition, police investigations in all the above- mentioned cases are in progress. Slovak authorities promised to take action, but they also accuse Hungarian counterparts of overreacting to these incidents, saying similar accidents do not usually get attention of government. According to the mainstream Hungarian and Slovak media, this series of incidents was encouraged by the fact that J√°n Slota's party joined the ruling coalition government or by his anti-Hungarian statements, described by the Hungarian Human Rights Foundation as ultra-nationalist,New Slovak Government Embraces Ultra-Nationalists, Excludes Hungarian Coalition Party HRF Alert: \\"Hungarians are the cancer of the Slovak nation, without delay we need to remove them from the body of the nation.\\" (√öj Sz√≥, April 15, 2005) made in early summer. ==Political affairs and statements== On 26 August Hungarian Prime Minister, Ferenc Gyurcs√°ny said there is a direct connection between the governmental role of Slota's party and the incidents. According to Gyurcs√°ny: \\"The Ghost is already out of the bottle\\". Gyurcs√°ny said that guaranteeing the safety of the Hungarian minority in Slovakia is the personal responsibility of Slovak PM Robert Fico who signed the coalition with Slota. The Slovak ambassador's deputy in Budapest was called to the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs where he received an official note of protest from the Hungarian Government. In the last week of August negotiations between the Slovak and Hungarian government somewhat eased the tensions between the two countries. Both Prime Ministers condemned any kind of ethnic violence. On the other hand, leading politicians of the Smer, ruling party of the Slovak government, blamed the Party of the Hungarian Coalition for internationally discrediting Slovakia. On 4 September, Boris Zala, deputy president of the Smer accused Hungarian minority politicians with disloyalty to Slovakia. After the Slovakia elections of 2006, the victorious left-wing party, Smer, formed a coalition with the right-wing nationalist party, SNS (Slovak National Party),The non-governmental Hungarian Human Rights Foundation described SNS as an extremist ultra-nationalist party.New Slovak Government Embraces Ultra- Nationalists, Excludes Hungarian Coalition Party HRF Alert: \\"Hungarians are the cancer of the Slovak nation, without delay we need to remove them from the body of the nation.\\" (√öj Sz√≥, April 15, 2005) whose leader, J√°n Slota, is notorious for anti-Hungarian statements (see J√°n Slota and Information in English from the Hungarian Human Rights Foundation). J√°n Slota himself is not in the government (a condition for the inclusion of his party in the government has been that he will not himself be a member of the government). The program of the new government explicitly says that it will maintain the status quo of the minority institutions and rights. The new government, however, refused to distance itself from the extremist statements of Slota on the grounds that he is not a member of the government and his statements are not official. ==See also== *Slovakization *Hungary‚ÄìSlovakia relations *Hedvig Malina *2009 ban of Hungarian President from Slovakia ==References== Category:Politics of Slovakia Slovak-Hungarian Category:Diplomatic incidents Slovak-Hungarian diplomatic affairs Slovak-Hungarian Diplomatic Affairs, 2006 ","title":"2006 Slovak‚ÄìHungarian diplomatic affairs"},{"id":"9111829","text":"Eustorgius II () was Archbishop of Milan from c. 511 to 518.

Built between 1725 and 1740, the main block was demolished in 1925. ==Early history== Artist's impression (1864) of Lathom House at the time of the Civil War Arms of Latham of Latham: Or, on a chief indented azure, three plates. Quartered by Stanley, Earl of Derby A wooden castle is believed to have stood on the site in mediaeval times. Sir John I Stanley of the Isle of Man (1350‚Äì1414), Lord Lieutenant of Ireland and King of Mann married Isabel Latham, daughter and heiress of Sir Thomas Latham of Latham.Seacome, John, History of the House of Stanley, Preston, 1793, p.26; History of Latham family see p.47 et seq. The stone-built castle known as Lathom House, built by the Stanley family in 1496, had eighteen towers, and was surrounded by a wall six foot thick and a moat eight yards wide, its drawbridge defended by a gateway tower. In the centre of the site was a tall tower known as the Eagle Tower. In 1554, Protestant martyr George Marsh, was questioned at Lathom House by Edward Stanley before being sent to Lancaster Castle.Foxe's Book of Martyrs by John Foxe Lathom House was the last Royalist stronghold in Lancashire during the English Civil War and was twice besieged by Parliamentarian forces. During the first Siege of Lathom House by Sir Thomas Fairfax in 1644, the house was defended by Charlotte Stanley, Countess of Derby and 300 men who kept possession until Royalist forces under Prince Rupert of the Rhine arrived in the area en route to attack Bolton. After the siege the countess and her retinue fled to the Isle of Man. In 1645 the house was again besieged by General Egerton with 4000 Parliamentarian soldiers, and was surrendered after a protracted siege after which the fortifications were demolished by the Parliamentarians. James Stanley, husband of Charlotte, was beheaded in Bolton by the Parliamentarians in 1651 for treason. The Stanley manors were confiscated by Parliament. ==Post Restoration== The surviving West Wing of Lathom House After the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660, Lathom House was returned to the Stanleys and remained with them until 1714 when it passed by the marriage of Henrietta Stanley to John Ashburnham, 3rd Baron Ashburnham who sold it. It was subsequently bought by Sir Thomas Bootle, MP for Liverpool, who commissioned Giacomo Leoni to rebuild the house as the finest Palladian house in the county. Built over 15 years from 1725‚Äì40, its deer park was designed by renowned landscape gardener Humphry Repton. It passed through his niece to Richard Wilbraham Bootle and their son, Edward, Lord Skelmersdale. The latter's grandson Edward inherited and was made Earl of Lathom. Edward's son, the second earl, was accidentally shot and died in 1910. The last resident of Lathom House was Edward Bootle- Wilbraham 3rd Earl of Lathom (and 4th Baron of Skelmersdale). During the First World War the hall was used for military purposes, mainly the training of horses, and after the war the third earl decided not to renovate and reoccupy it but to live instead at nearby Blythe Hall. The estate was sold in 1920 to a London consortium. After a brief period as a boys‚Äô school, the main block of the house was demolished in 1925.Robinson, p. 136 The estate land of 4000 acres was sold piecemeal, mainly to the tenants. The remaining west wing of the house was converted to apartments. ==Archaeology== The ruins of Lathom House were excavated by the Historical Council of Northern Lancashire, in its efforts to reconstruct the 18th-century buildings; the team on site came across medieval foundations and have tried to salvage them. While the main buildings became uninhabitable several decades ago, there are almshouse cottages neighbouring the Lathom Park Chapel. ==See also== *Listed buildings in Lathom * ==ReferencesBibliography=== *Robinson, John, Felling the Ancient Oaks, Aurum Press, 2011, ==External links== * Category:British country houses destroyed in the 20th century Category:Country houses in Lancashire Category:Stanley family Category:Buildings and structures in the Borough of West Lancashire ","title":"Lathom House"},{"id":"9111871","text":"Mystic Lake is a seasonal lake in the San Jacinto Valley of western Riverside County, California.

Because the San Jacinto basin is actively and rapidly subsiding (on a geologic time- scale), the USGS estimates that the potential size of the lake (the rapidly expanding closed depression) will continue to grow. ==Juan Bautista de Anza Anza Trail== The Anza Trail passes by the lake, which was described by Juan Bautista de Anza in 1774 as \\"several leagues in circumference and as full of white geese as water.\\" Anza named it Laguna de Bucareli, after Antonio Mar√≠a de Bucareli y Urs√∫a, the viceroy of New Spain. Much later, it became known as Mystic Lake. ==San Jacinto Wildlife Area== The lake is adjacent to the 9,000‚Äìacre San Jacinto Wildlife Area,http://www.dfg.ca.gov/lands/wa/region6/sanjacinto/index.html which is owned and managed by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife and open to the public. It features restored wetlands and wildlife habitat. Mystic Lake is a high priority acquisition area for the Department to add to the Wildlife Area. It is a popular destination for bird-watchers and hunters. ==See also== *Juan Bautista de Anza National Historic Trail - National Park Service *List of lakes in California == References == ==External links== *San Jacinto Wildlife Area website *National Park Service: Juan Bautista de Anza National Historic Trail **Anza Trail Historic Sites in California Category:Lakes of Riverside County, California Category:Santa Ana River Category:San Jacinto River (California) Category:Perris, California Category:Lakes of California Category:Lakes of Southern California Category:Bird sanctuaries of the United States ","title":"Mystic Lake (California)"},{"id":"9111920","text":"Capelle is now part of Sprang-Capelle, in North Brabant, Netherlands.

The Norman Conquest of England by William the Conqueror in 1066 resulted in the arrival of French aristocracy, while in the 16th and 17th centuries Protestant Huguenots fled religious persecution to East London. Other waves (but less likely to have put down permanent roots) are associated with monasticism, particularly post-conquest Benedictines and Cistercians, aristocracy fleeing the French Revolution, expulsion of religious orders by Third Republic France, and current economic migrants. The 2011 UK Census recorded 137,862 French-born people living in the UK. Almost half of these were resident in the capital, London. Many more British people have French ancestry. French remains the foreign language most learned by Britons. It has traditionally been spoken as a second language by the country's educated classes and its popularity is reinforced by the close geographical proximity between Great Britain and France. ==History== Much of the UK's medieval aristocracy was descended from Franco-Norman migrants to England from the time of the Norman Conquest. Prominent families of the period, include the Grosvenor family originally, \\"Gros Veneur\\" (in Norman) \\"great hunter\\": their influence can be found throughout central London with many roads, squares and buildings bearing their family names, such as Grosvenor Square and Grosvenor House. Ancestors of the Molyneux family, the Earls of Sefton who arrived in England around the time of the Norman Conquest, bore the name \\"de Molines\\": they came from Molineaux-sur-Seine, near Rouen, in Normandy where they resided in the Ch√¢teau de Robert-le-Diable also known as Ch√¢teau de Moulineaux. Other well known names are the Beauchamps (Beecham), Courtois and Le Mesurier. Some British people are descended from the Huguenots, French Protestants who in the 16th and 17th centuries fled religious persecution in France. Although a substantial French Protestant community existed in London from the sixteenth century, the suppression of Protestantism in France in the 1680s led to a mass migration of predominantly Calvinist refugees, most of whom settled in London, partly in Spitalfields in the east and Soho in the west. The French protestant community was one of the largest and most distinctive communities in the capital in the 18th-century. Later, during and after the French Revolution, there was also an influx of French Catholics. ==Population and distribution== The 2011 UK Census recorded 127,601 French-born residents in England, 2,203 in Wales, 7,147 in Scotland, and 911 in Northern Ireland, making a UK total of 137,862. The previous, 2001 UK Census, had recorded 96,281 French-born residents. The Office for National Statistics estimates that 150,000 French- born immigrants were resident in the UK in 2013. Figure given is the central estimate. See the source for 95 per cent confidence intervals. Of the French- born people recorded by the 2011 census, 66,654 (48.4 per cent) lived in Greater London and 22,584 (16.4 per cent) in South East England. Within London, particular concentrations were recorded in the boroughs of Kensington and Chelsea, Westminster and Hammersmith and Fulham. There are several French schools in London, some independent, and others, La Petite √âcole Fran√ßaise in west London and the Lyc√©e Fran√ßais Charles de Gaulle, situated in South Kensington are run by the French state. The French Consulate in London has estimated that 270,000 French people live in the city, but the ONS contests this, pointing out that the number of French passport holders recorded by the 2011 census was only 86,000. The French Embassy's estimate includes London plus \\"the south eastern quadrant of the UK including Kent, Oxfordshire and maybe Sussex too\\". Many British people have French ancestry. According to a 2010 study by Ancestry.co.uk, three million British people are of French descent. ==Education== French international schools in the United Kingdom: * Lyc√©e Fran√ßais Charles de Gaulle * Lyc√©e International de Londres Winston Churchill - London * √âcole fran√ßaise de Bristol * √âcole d'entreprise Total (Aberdeen) ==Notable people== Famous British people who can trace their ancestry back to France include Isambard Kingdom Brunel, Michel Roux Jr, Joanne Harris, Dustin Demri-Burns, Davina McCall, John Hegley, Simon Le Bon, Noel Fielding and Emma Watson. Top French chief executives attracted to Britain have been: Xavier Rolet (LSE) and Vincent de Rivaz (EDF Energy). In the kitchen chefs working in the UK include Raymond Blanc, who has spent most of his working life in Britain and presents cookery programmes on British television. Brothers Albert and Michel Roux, were the first chefs in Britain to be awarded three Michelin stars in 1982 for their restaurant, Le Gavroche. At the start of the 2011‚Äì12 season, aside from home-grown and Irish talent, there were more French-born footballers in the Premier League than any other nationality. Frenchman Ars√®ne Wenger was the Premier League's longest serving manager, since assuming the role at Arsenal F.C. in October 1996 before retiring in May 2018. == See also == * British migration to France ==References== ==External links== *French Institute London *French Protestant Church of London *Reassessing what we collect website ‚Äì French London History of French London with objects and images Category:British people of French descent United Kingdom Category:Huguenot history in the United Kingdom Category:Immigration to the United Kingdom by country of origin ","title":"French migration to the United Kingdom"},{"id":"9112101","text":"Lila Hanitra Ratsifandrihamanana (born 1959) is a Malagasy politician and diplomat.

It has a rockier, new wave edge compared to his previous releases. The album peaked at number 59 on the Billboard Top Pop Albums chart and No. 31 in the UK in 1980. The album also peaked at No. 1 in Sweden, No. 3 in France, No. 15 in the Netherlands and No. 42 in Italy. Donald Guarisco of AllMusic described Clues as \\"one of Robert Palmer's strongest and most consistent albums\\", despite being somewhat short at 31 minutes. Palmer, who played percussion on Talking Heads' Remain in Light, had the favour returned when the band's drummer Chris Frantz played bass drum on \\"Looking for Clues\\" along with Palmer's drummer, Dony Wynn. Andy Fraser, the former bassist of Free and the author of Palmer's first breakthrough single \\"Every Kinda People\\", played bass on the album on two songs. New wave musician Gary Numan co-wrote a song with Palmer (another co-write between the two appearing on Maybe It's Live) and played keyboards on a remake of his own song \\"I Dream of Wires\\". This was first issued on CD in 1985 when Island's catalogue was issued under WEA Manufacturing. The WEA pressings are sought-after collector's items. The video to the first track on the album, \\"Looking for Clues\\", aired on MTV's first day of broadcasting, on 1 August 1981.

The movie was directed by Marion Gering and is considered an unsuccessful follow-up to Raft and Lombard's smash hit Bolero the previous year. ==Plot== In Havana, Cuba, an American dancer called Joe Martin has a winning lottery ticket. However wealthy socialite Diana Harrison also has a lottery ticket with the same number. Joe's ticket is counterfeit so he misses out on the money. Diana feels sorry for him and offers to back him in his own night club but then changes her mind after he tries to seduce her. Joe then discovers the rumba dance when he visits his home town during a fiesta. He gets financial backing from a Texan to establish a new nightclub with Flash, his manager. Joe dances the rumba with Carmelita and is a big success. Diana goes to opening night with her boyfriend Hobart Fletcher. She dances with Joe and they fall in love. However Carmelita helps break them up. Back in New York Diana discovers that Joe left New York because he had evidence that would send a gang member to prison. Diana breaks up with Hobart. Joe reads about this, signs with a Broadway producer and returns to New York. Joe is threatened with death by gangsters but decides to perform anyway. Carmelita faints out of fear but Diana steps up and performs the rumba with Joe. The performance is a big success and it's revealed that the gangster threats was a publicity stunt. ==Cast== *George Raft as Joe Martin *Carole Lombard as Diana Harrison *Lynne Overman as Flash *Margo as Carmelita *Gail Patrick as Patsy Fletcher *Iris Adrian as Goldie Allen *Monroe Owsley as Fletcher Hobart *Jameson Thomas as Jack Solanger *Soledad Jimenez as Maria *Paul Porcasi as Carlos *Samuel S.

Filming took place in November and December 1934. The film starred Margot a Mexican dancer who had just made her film debut in Crime Without Passion. Danvce team Veloz and Yolanda coached Lombard and Raft in the dance sequences. The signature rumba danced near the end by Raft and Lombard seems to be a simplified variation of rumba performed by Veloz and Yolanda themselves the year before in another Paramount film starring George Burns and Gracie Allen, Many Happy Returns. George Raft reportedly fought with Lombard during the shoot and refused to make a film with her later. He claimed this was because Paramount assigned Ted Tetzlaff to shoot the film and on Rumba Raft thought Tetzlaff favored Lombard rather than him. ==Reception== The film has been described as a box office flopEverett Aaker, The Films of George Raft, McFarland & Company, 2013 p 55 and a hit. The Los Angeles Times thought the story was even more \\"preposterous\\" than Bolero but felt it was a better movie due to its dancing, attractive women and music, calling the film \\"a sensory experience\\". ==References== == External links == * * *Review of fiml at Variety * Category:1935 films Category:1930s romantic musical films Category:American musical drama films Category:American films Category:American romantic drama films Category:American romantic musical films Category:American black-and-white films Category:English-language films Category:Paramount Pictures films Category:Films directed by Marion Gering Category:Films set in Havana Category:Publicity stunts in fiction ","title":"Rumba (1935 film)"},{"id":"9112169","text":"Venyov () is a town and the administrative center of Venyovsky District in Tula Oblast, Russia, located on the Venyovka River, east of Tula, the administrative center of the oblast.

He has been described as \\"the most subversive comedy force on Irish television\\".

He won the public vote to represent Ireland at the Eurovision Song Contest 2008 with the song \\"Irelande Douze Pointe\\", though he did not progress past the first semi-final stage. ==Music== Dustin released his Greatest Hits album in 2001. On 4 November 2005, he released his first new single for four years, \\"Patricia the Stripper\\", a duet with Chris de Burgh aka Christy Burger. On 11 November 2005, he then released a new album, also his first for four years, called Bling When You're Minging (a play on the title of Robbie Williams' 2000 album Sing When You're Winning). These albums featured backing vocals from many Irish stars including Ronnie Drew, Bob Geldof, Boyzone and the late Joe Dolan.

Though it was not announced on the Eurosong show how many votes Dustin won, an RT√â radio show later revealed that the second place had an average of 15 points, while Dustin had 23, so the public really did want to send a puppet to Eurovision. Despite it being a public vote, there was a mixed reaction from the live studio audience when the result was announced, including many audible boos. A panellist on the programme, former Eurovision winner Dana, stated that Ireland would be better withdrawing from the competition than sending Dustin. Despite her lack of support, past Irish Eurovision entries Dickie Rock and Maxi stated their beliefs that Dustin could win. Dustin performed his song in the first semi-final on 20 May. The song contained, among other things, references to Riverdance (\\"Give us another chance, we're sorry for Riverdance!\\") and Michael Flatley (\\"Sure Flatley he's a yank\\"). Dustin failed to progress beyond the Eurovision semi-final. ==Political career== Dustin has often declared his interest in politics. He has campaigned in two presidential elections. He competed as Dustin Hoffman in the 1997 presidential election as both forename and surname were necessary to register. Returning officers received votes spoiled with his name in more recent elections. He received some support but many of those ballots were also spoiled. In his mock campaigns, he ran as a representative of \\"Fianna Fowl\\" (a play on Ireland's largest political party Fianna F√°il) and also of the 'Poultry Party'. His campaign manifestos have included promising \\"to bring the DART to Dingle\\", as well as making sure every young boy in Ireland got to go on a date with the Spice Girl or Pussycat Doll of their choice and industrialising all of Ireland's rural areas, while ruralising everywhere else. His strongly-held republican views led him to publicly confront former colleagues Zig and Zag on 2Phat's 1998 Christmas Special. During the live broadcast he angrily denounced them for 'selling out to the Queen' and verbally abused both them and co-host Ray D'Arcy.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP34VUZ3zFg He has also led the campaign group SOLD (\\"Stamp Out Line Dancing\\"). He is a UNICEF ambassador. ==Other appearances== Dustin made a film titled Dustin in Fowl Play in 2002. In this film, he and his friend, Snotser, put together a boy band called Mankind featuring band members Simon Murphy, Paul Barry, Ronan McDonald, John McCall and Chris Miller. In 2008, he made an appearance on British ITV show The Xtra Factor.The Xtra Factor. 22 November 2008. In 2009, Dustin was the subject of the documentary Dustin: 20 Years a Pluckin'. In June 2012, he made an appearance on The Late Late Show 50th anniversary special. He presented the TV3 toy show with Lucy Kennedy on 2 December 2016. Dustin the Turkey has been an Ambassador for UNICEF Ireland since late 2009 and visited the KwaZulu-Natal province of South Africa, where he found out at firsthand the impact of HIV/AIDS on communities and children and ways that UNICEF is working to help very young children cope. ==References== ==External links== * RT√â Entertainment: Dustin is among Eurosong finalists * Eurovision.tv: Dustin the Turkey in Irish national final?

It is located in the municipality of Kapelle on the island of Zuid-Beveland, 23 km east of Middelburg and 120 km southwest of Amsterdam. It was built in a typical circular style which is fairly common in south Beveland. The coat of arms of Eversdijk contains a sterling silver wild boar of a black Tincture on a loose green sinople soil. ==History== The name comes from an unknown person called Everdeis, who once constructed a dike at this location. The village is built amidst two roads with a path serving as intersection between them. Within the triangle created, a church was built out of the parish of 's-Heer Abtskerke, and dedicated to St. Paul. The bell was cast in 1525 by Peter Waghevens and the clock carried the following inscription: \\"Sebastiaen ben ic ghegoten van Peter Waghevens te Mechelen binnen lof heb God tot rechter minnen, MCCCCCLLD.\\" Under this heading one sees four ring-shaped images, perhaps passages of the life of Saint Sebastian. In the course of the middle ages the village of Eversdijk remained stuck in its development. The main reason for this was the depletion of the peat found around the village. In the 17th and 18th centuries Eversdijk became a hamlet and on 1 January 1816, the until then independent commune was attached to that of Kapelle, of which Eversdijk is now a part. The church collapsed in 1821 and in 1840, the bell tower was demolished, the clock being sold at public auction on June 11, 1840. When the clock of 's Heer Abtskerke became useless, the one in Eversdijk was exchanged with the municipality of Kapelle. ==References== Category:Populated places in Zeeland Category:Former municipalities of Zeeland Category:Kapelle ","title":"Eversdijk"},{"id":"9112492","text":"Teu √ì hAilp√≠n is an Irish sportsperson (Gaelic footballer) playing for Na Piarsaigh GAA and Australian Rules football club Leeside Lions.

The family still owns the majority of the pharmaceutical company Merck. ==History== The family first appeared in Hammelburg in the 15th century. The family has a long history in pharmacy going back to the 17th century. In 1668 Friedrich Jacob Merck purchased the second town pharmacy in Darmstadt, known as the Engel-Apotheke or Angel Pharmacy, which would evolve into the major company Merck, the world's oldest operating pharmaceutical and chemical company. When Friedrich died, the pharmacy was passed on to his nephew and it has been owned by the family ever since. The sixth person in this series of pharmacists was Heinrich Emanuel Merck who in 1827 established the chemical-pharmaceutical factory in Darmstadt, which laid the foundations for the company's research operations and growth from a pharmacy to a major company in the 19th century. The Merck family controls a majority of 70.3% of the company's shares. An American former subsidiary of the Merck company, Merck & Co. (MSD), was also established by the Merck family and still carries the family's name, but, unlike its former parent company, is no longer owned by the Merck family, since it was nationalized by the American government in 1917 because of World War I and the stock was bought back by George F. Merck in 1919. Merck & Co. was also led by family member George W. Merck (son of George F. Merck) from 1925 until 1950.

The episode's plot centers on the WJM-TV staff's humorous reaction to the absurd death of Chuckles the Clown, an often-mentioned but seldom-seen character who starred in an eponymously titled show at the station. ==Plot== News anchor Ted Baxter is hired as the grand marshal for a circus parade, but is ordered by Lou Grant to turn down the \\"honor\\". Ted is upset and tries to rally Mary to his side. Mary agrees that Lou acted a bit hastily, but then tells Ted that Chuckles the Clown has been asked in his place and has accepted. The next day, as Mary and Murray are watching Ted deliver the live newscast, Lou rushes into the newsroom in shock and tells the staff that Chuckles has been killed during the parade. He had dressed as the character Peter Peanut, and a rogue elephant tried to \\"shell\\" him, causing fatal injuries. During a commercial break, Lou orders Ted to adlib a eulogy for Chuckles, with disastrous results. The next day at the studio, the unusual circumstances of Chuckles' death provoke a wave of workplace jokes, especially by Lou, Sue Ann Nivens and Murray Slaughter (e.g. \\"You know how hard it is to stop after just one peanut!\\" and \\"He could've gone as Billy Banana and had a gorilla peel him to death.\\") They dissolve into helpless laughter, except for Mary, who is appalled by her co- workers' apparent lack of respect for the deceased. They try to assure her that they mean no disrespect for Chuckles. Their reaction is simply an emotional release, a response to humankind's fear of death: \\"Everyone does it.\\" Mary shames them into uncomfortable silence by answering, \\"I don't.\\" At the funeral, the jokes continue until the services are about to start, at which time a final scolding by Mary encourages her friends to become properly somber. However, Mary alone begins to giggle uncontrollably as the minister recounts Chuckles' comedy characters and comic routines. She tries to stifle her laughter, but cannot contain herself as Reverend Burns delivers the eulogy: :\\"Chuckles the Clown brought pleasure to millions. The characters he created will be remembered by children and adults alike: Peter Peanut; Mr. Fee-Fi-Fo; Billy Banana; and my particular favorite, Aunt Yoo-Hoo. And not just for the laughter they provided ‚Äî there was always some deeper meaning to whatever Chuckles did. Do you remember Mr. Fee-Fi-Fo's little catchphrase? Remember how, when his arch-rival Se√±or Kaboom hit him with a giant cucumber and knocked him down, Mr. Fee-Fi-Fo would always pick himself up, dust himself off, and say 'I hurt my foo-foo'? Life's a lot like that. From time to time we all fall down and hurt our foo-foos. If only we could deal with it as simply and bravely and honestly as Mr. Fee-Fi-Fo. And what did Chuckles ask in return? Not much. In his own words, 'A little song, a little dance, a little seltzer down your pants.'\\" Mary's friends, and the other attendees, are shocked by her laughter. The minister, however, asks the mortified Mary to rise, and assures her that her laughter is actually in keeping with Chuckles' life's work. \\"He lived to make people laugh. Tears were offensive to him; deeply offensive‚Ä¶So go ahead, my dear: laugh for Chuckles.\\" Mary then bursts into helpless, heartbreaking sobs. Back at Mary's apartment after the funeral, she and her friends discuss how they envision their funerals. Sue Ann says she just wants to be cremated and have her ashes thrown on Robert Redford; Lou says he doesn't want anyone to \\"make a fuss\\" about his death, explaining \\"When I go, I just wanna be stood outside in the garbage with my hat on\\"; and Mary says she just doesn't want \\"an organ playing a lot of sad music\\" at her funeral. Murray asks her \\"What do you want them to play, 'Everything's Coming Up Roses'\\"? Finally, Ted envisions \\"a nice, fancy funeral\\" for himself, but only if he's going to die. After being questioned about what he means by \\"if\\", Ted then explains that if he gets real sick to where he's going to die, he wants someone to \\"take him away and freeze him\\" and then in \\"200‚Äì300 years when they find a cure\\", to just un-freeze him. Mary then asks Ted to do her a favor when they freeze him ‚Äì \\"Could you take this with you?\\", and takes out of her refrigerator the \\"food mobile\\" Sue Ann gave her at the beginning of the episode; everyone laughs as the credits roll. ==Background== Chuckles's first on-camera appearance was in the episode \\"The Snow Must Go On\\". Richard SchaalRichard Schaal, TV Actor and Second City Veteran, Dies at 86 - The New York Times, November 6, 2014Comic Actor Richard Schaal Dies at 86 - The Hollywood Reporter, November 5, 2014 portrayed Chuckles when he arrives at TV station WJM the morning after a city election, to find the news staff‚Äîhaving lost contact with City Hall during a blizzard‚Äîstill on the air. Chuckles has the election results in his newspaper, and announces the winner of the mayoral race on the air in clown character.

In this episode, Chuckles meets with Lou Grant, who has been temporarily promoted to WJM's program manager. Chuckles is seen arriving for the meeting in full clown makeup. Mark Gordon next played Chuckles in \\"Son of 'But, Seriously Folks'\\".

From Harper's Magazine. He was commissioned into the 60th Foot as an ensign in 1856 when he was nineteen years old. Soon after, his regiment was sent to the Cape of Good Hope, and from there to India. He traveled to England in 1858, having been promoted to the rank of Lieutenant. In 1861 he sold his commission and retired from the army. Mackenzie began to practice chess in 1853, and in 1862 he won a handicap tournament in London in which he defeated Adolf Anderssen.Arthur Bisguier and Andrew Soltis, American Chess Masters from Morphy to Fischer (1974), pp. 36‚Äì37 In 1863, during the middle of the American Civil War, he moved to the United States. During the Civil War, he fought on the Union side, obtaining the rank of Captain in the 10th United States Colored Troops Regiment.Edward Winter's Chess Notes 5785 However, on 16 June 1864, he was reported as a deserter by the United States Army. In 1865, Mackenzie came to New York, where he wrote on chess matters for Turf, Field, and Farm. He won the first prizes at the annual contests of the New York Chess Club in 1865, 1866, 1867, and 1868. ==Death== Mackenzie died at the Cooper Union Hotel on 14 April 1891, but the cause of death is a matter of considerable speculation.Edward Winter, Chess Notes 7772: G.H. Mackenzie's Death The New York Times reported on 27 April 1890 that Mackenzie was suffering from tuberculosis, and on 15 April 1891, a day after his death, mentioned that the immediate cause of death was pneumonia, noting that his condition had worsened from a fever caught while visiting Havana. However, on 29 April 1891, The Sun carried a report by Dr. S. B.

The doctor who had attended Mackenzie during his final illness dismissed this assertion as ridiculous, insisting that tuberculosis was the cause of death. ==Chess career== Mackenzie dominated American chess from the time he immigrated in 1863 until shortly before his death in 1891. During a 15-year period, from 1865 through 1880, Mackenzie amassed a record of thirteen straight first-place finishes in tournaments, while winning six of seven matches, with only one drawn. His successes in the U.S. included first place at Cleveland 1871, Chicago 1874, and New York 1880 (the second, third, and fifth American Chess Congresses, respectively). In 1878 Mackenzie began to receive invitations to play in the top international tournaments in Europe. Subsequently, he played in many tournaments both at home and abroad. In 1878, he tied for fourth‚Äìfifth in Paris. In 1882, he tied for fourth in Vienna (Wilhelm Steinitz and Szymon Winawer won). In 1883, he tied for fifth‚Äìseventh in London (Johannes Zukertort won). In 1885, he took fourth place in Hereford (Joseph Henry Blackburne won), and took seventh in Hamburg 1885 (Isidor Gunsberg won). In 1886, he tied for seventh‚Äìeighth in London. The best result of his career was winning the fifth German Championship at Frankfurt-on-the-Main 1887, ahead of all the leading players except for World Champion Wilhelm Steinitz: Blackburne, Zukertort, Berthold Englisch, Max Weiss, Curt von Bardeleben, Siegbert Tarrasch, and Louis Paulsen.Frankfurt 1887, Chessgames.com He won the fifth Scottish Championship at Glasgow 1888 with a score of +4‚àí0=2.1888 Scottish ChampionshipKen Whyld,Chess, The Records (1986), p. 150 Samuel Lipschuetz replaced him as the United States Chess Champion in 1890.

Kazan (1889‚Äì1971) is considered the \\"father of U.S. cooperative housing\\".University of Connecticut Dept. of Economics Paper on Housing Cooperative History ==Biography== Abraham Kazan was born in 1889. Growing up as an eyewitness to appalling tenement conditions, Kazan believed that housing was a vital obstacle for the average person. The problem, as he saw it, was more pronounced in urban settings.\\"Coop Village History\\" Large numbers of people lived within cities, either to be closer work or to be able to share space with multitudes of people who would help contribute to the monthly rent. As the president of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers (ACW) Credit Union, Kazan understood that most people, rich and poor, usually considered a home as ‚Äúpurely a product of his own efforts.‚Äù Yet, unlike all other routine necessities, owning a home required a sizable initial investment that was usually beyond that of those with moderate means or salaries. He felt that this made newly constructed buildings often out of reach for the poorer earners, causing harsher social and moral conditions with the tenement communities where the poorer people lived in tightly congested clusters. Kazan did not believe that good housing conditions would guarantee normal, healthy people and families, but he was convinced that substandard housing does directly and adversely affect health, morale, and the social conditions of those who live there within it.\\"Cooperative Housing in the United States/\\", Abraham E. Kazan, Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, Vol. 191, Consumers' Cooperation (May 1937), pp. 137‚Äì143. Open spaces were important for healthy children, and he believed that lack of quality conditions would result in child delinquency, crime, disease and a host of other social and health crises that would fester. To try to address this problem he developed the idea of cooperative housing‚Äînot merely to create a residential building or complex, but complete cooperative villages. The resulting communities had co-op shopping centers, with supermarkets, pharmacies, credit unions, optical centers and playgrounds. He earned distinction for his work of integrating sections of New York City through affordable cooperative housing. Today, more than 100,000 people live in homes built by his efforts.One of the Best Histories online on Jessor and the Cooperative movement He took his cooperative idea even further and succeeded in federating the \\"Co-op Supermarkets\\" into a larger collective in order to give the markets competitive abilities to contend with the established chains. Kazan also inspired the building of co-op electric generating plants to bring down the price of power. Over the past two decades, most, if not all of the Co-op Supermarkets in New York City have been sold to the larger chains. His life's work was recognized in many ways, as he became the first person in New York City's history to have a street namedNew York City Council Resolution extending the street to make it longer in 1993 for him in his lifetime (Abraham E. Kazan Street on the Lower East Side of ManhattanStreetwise, \\"History of Street Names\\" ). == Kazan's Cooperatives == One of the first housing co-operative developments in the United States, started in 1927, was Amalgamated Housing in the Northwest Bronx. Kazan founded this development and was its President for 40 years, its Manager for thirty, and a resident. The Amalgamated, as it is known, is still a thriving co-operative community. Among other developments Kazan was responsible for are his early projects, Amalgamated Dwellings,NYTimes, Streetscapes/Amalgamated Dwellings; Built in 1931 by Idealism, Threatened Now by Reality, By CHRISTOPHER GRAY, July 3, 1994 Hillman Housing, Seward Park HousingKazan's Seward story in PDF and East River Housing on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, known as Cooperative Village prior to its fragmentation. Later developments, under Kazan's United Housing Foundation (UHF),History of Co-ops include the Penn South community in the Chelsea area of Manhattan, Warbasse Houses (Brooklyn), Rochdale Village (Queens), and Co-op City in the Bronx, the largest co-operative development of its kind. == See also == * List of New York City housing cooperatives == References == ==External links== * Many of Kazan's projects were built by Architect Herman Jessor Category:1889 births Category:1971 deaths Category:Cooperative organizers Category:Activists from New York City ","title":"Abraham E.

Szczuczyn was a private town, administratively located in the Masovian Voivodeship in the Greater Poland Province of the Polish Crown. Stanis≈Çaw Antoni Szczuka, who died in Warsaw in 1710, was buried in the local Piarist church. In the 18th century the town passed to the powerful Potocki family.

Lawrence, a devout Christian, moved his family from Ireland to the United States in the late 19th century. After arriving in New York, he headed south, eventually settling in south central Georgia in the community which later became Ashburn. Lawrence's first attempt at a newspaper was a religious publication, according to subsequent stories told about him by his daughter Nora Lawrence Smith. No copies of Lawrence's first paper, if it ever existed, have surfaced. There is reason to doubt the stories of Miz Nora, as she was called, because among other stories, she told of leading her family's covered wagon through the woods at night with a lantern. The time frame she gave for this would have her being about two or three years old at most, considering her stated birthday. Miz Nora, for reasons no one really knows, postdated the first edition of The Wiregrass Farmer and Stockman to 1899 in subsequent editions of the paper by changing its volume number. It is believed that Lawrence's religious paper was published in 1899, and she included those editions as part of The Wiregrass Farmer. The first actual Wiregrass Farmer and Stockman was published on the last Saturday in March 1902. It has remained in business ever since, publishing an issue each week. The newspaper serves as the official Legal Organ for Turner County and the cities of Ashburn, Rebecca, and Sycamore. The University of Georgia has microfilmed copies of extant editions on file at the Athens campus in the Newspaper Project archives.

At that time the population was 334. Since then that number has fluctuated, but on the whole has increased. An example of this fluctuation is in 1911 where the population was 305. After that it increased up to 415 in 1951. Today the figure stands at 484.

However, that number did increase to 4 in 1901. The number of houses occupied has generally increased since the first census in 1881. The largest increase in occupied houses occurred from 1931 to 1951, where 50 more houses were occupied since the previous recorded census. ==Health== Figures from the 2011 census showed, 57.9% of residents of Rushton had very good health. When compared to Cheshire west and Chester(48.5), North West (46.5) and England in general(47.2), Rushton had a significant higher rating of very healthy people. This data was collected by local residents who described their health as very good. 30.2% of Rushton's residents described their health as good, this was a slightly lower percentage than the greater region of the North West (33.1) and England's data (34.2). Rushton has a very low disability rate. Only 4.3% had a disability or a long term injury which has lasted/thought to last 12 months. This percentage is half the rate of the average in England ==Jessie Hughes Village Hall== The Jessie Hughes hall or the Hall of Eaton was opened on 26 September 1926. The main enforcer in building the hall, was a woman called Mrs Jessie Hughes, who was the wife of the Rector of Tarporley. At the time she was the president of the Women's Institute and played a pivotal role in raising money for the town hall to be built. She opened the hall by laying a corner stone and declared the stone well and truly laid. In 1928 Mrs Hughes died, but today her hard work is still remembered through an inscribed stone which reads \\"This stone was laid by Jessie L Hughes 1926\\" The original village hall fell into disrepair and was rebuilt in 2008. The replacement building retained the name Jessie Hughes Village Hall following a local ballot, and was joint winner of the Cheshire Pride Community Project Award in 2008 ‚Äì see http://www.silvatimber.co.uk/case-study-jessie-hughes-village-hall ==See also== *Listed buildings in Rushton, Cheshire ==References== ==External links== Category:Villages in Cheshire Category:Civil parishes in Cheshire ","title":"Rushton, Cheshire"},{"id":"9112731","text":"Warped window in the alley showing the defective foundation of the building on the northern side.

The event is a summertime event that focuses on vintage as well as modern Corvettes. The homecoming offers Corvette owners and specialty vendors opportunities to network. All Corvette production years and custom variations are welcome. The event features competitions in numerous judged shows, along with informative seminars to expand on Corvette knowledge. The event features a unique opportunity to find parts and products that will enhance Corvette ownership. There is a Corvette road tour, car corral, special parties, live music and an exclusive show called Sans Pareil (without equal). And in 2014 a new class was added called The Originals where the cars have to be at least 30 years and 80% original. The Homecoming also welcomes other classic vehicles including muscle cars and antiques. In 2008, NCH announced its first Grand Marshal, Bloomington Gold CEO David Burroughs. NCH partnered with American Red Cross promoting Vettetastic 2008, a public art project and fundraiser. In 2009, NCH announced its second Grand Marshal Wil Cooksey, long time plant manager of the Bowling Green Assembly Plant.

Merck studied pharmacy in Berlin and Vienna. He then worked at his father's Engel-Apotheke. In 1816 he took over management. In addition to this he was occupied with research on the chemical constitution of herbal natural material. He isolated alkaloids and prepared them in a pure state. In 1827, Merck sold all the known alkaloids to other pharmacists, chemists and physicians. From 1838 until 1841 he ran a candle factory and became a member of the town council of Darmstadt in 1828.

Auli was born in Felanitx, Majorca. He had a precocious musical talent and was already an organist when he entered the Dominican Order in 1814. On the dissolution of the Spanish monasteries in 1823 he wandered over Spain for several months, but in November of the same year he was allowed to return to Majorca. In 1825 he went back to Madrid to complete his theological education, playing the organ for a time at the Church of Our Lady of Atocha and being introduced to King Ferdinand VII. In 1828 he returned to Majorca living a very active musical life at the convent of Santo Domingo. The Mendiz√°bal law of 1835 forced him to abandon his orders and to leave his native Majorca. Shortly after he became an organist at Gibraltar. Back to the Balearic Isles in 1836, he settled in Felanitx and spent the rest of his life composing, serving occasionally as an organist, and producing his own operas at the local theaters.

They each quote from the other.Compare Joseph ·∏≤ara on Proverbs 4:4, 5:14, 6:23, 18:22; Rashi on Judges 3:26; Numbers 17:5, 24:14; Isaiah 10:24 In Rashi's house ·∏≤ara also made the acquaintance of Samuel ben Me√Ør.Compare RaSHBaM on Gen. 37:13 They likewise quote each other.Compare RaSHBaM on Genesis 24:60 and Numbers iv.10; Rosin, R.

He was among the first French exegetes and the forerunner of the French school of exegetes later to come. They were all to some extent influenced by his works, most notably among them, the Rashbam.

Epstein, l.c. pp. 34 et seq.). His grammatical standpoint is that of Rashi. Whole Hebrew sentences are sometimes translated into French. In his expressions he is not as terse as Rashi. He is bold enough to express the opinion that the Book of Samuel was not written by the prophet himself, but later (Commentary on I Samuel ix.9). He does not go into grammatical or philological research, and cares more for the sense of the whole sentence than for a single word. He shows more common sense than depth, and though he does not altogether hold aloof from aggadic interpretations, he takes a leading place among the exegetes of northern France, who in general preferred the rational exegesis. == References == Its bibliography: *Heinrich Gr√§tz, Gesch. vi.145; *Henri Gross, Gallia Judaica, p. 227; *Einstein, in Berliner's Magazin, xiii.206 et seq.; *Ernest Renan-Adolf Neubauer, Les Rabbins Fran√ßais, pp. 435, 438, 441, 488, 558; *Leopold Zunz, G.V. 2d ed., pp. 313, 410; *idem, Z.G.

The university has educational programs in chiropractic, Oriental medicine, acupuncture, therapeutic massage, and human biology. The university was founded in 1941 by John B. Wolfe, DC. Previously Northwestern College of Chiropractic, Northwestern Health Sciences University has focused on alternative health care education, patient care, and research for over 70 years. Since 1991, Northwestern‚Äôs Wolfe-Harris Center for Clinical Studies has become one of the largest natural health care research institutions in the United States. == Organization == Northwestern Health Sciences University Northwestern Health Sciences University is a private institution, receiving most of its funding through tuition, research grants, and alumni contributions. It comprises three colleges and schools: College of Chiropractic, the College of Acupuncture and Chinese Medicine, and the School of Massage Therapy. Northwestern is accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools. Founded in 1941, the College of Chiropractic offers a doctor of chiropractic degree. The College has created a clinical system, with several natural care centers, more than 150 community-based private-practice clinics, and final term preceptorship opportunities around the world. The University's public clinic system records more than 65,000 patient visits a year, making Northwestern the largest provider of natural health care services in Minnesota. The College of Acupuncture and Chinese Medicine (CACM) is the largest and oldest school in Minnesota offering master's degree programs accredited by the Accreditation Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine. Founded in 1990 as the Minnesota Institute of Acupuncture and Herbal Studies, CACM is a provider of education and clinical services in acupuncture and Chinese medicine. CACM student interns provide services in the Edith Davis Teaching Clinic on the University campus, and health care clinics and community agencies in the metropolitan area. The School of Massage Therapy is the only massage therapy school in Minnesota to receive accreditation from the Commission on Massage Therapy Accreditation (COMTA). The 36-semester credit, 780-hour program emphasizes a foundation in the basic sciences, more than 340 hours of hands-on lab experience, and a structured clinical experience within the School of Massage Therapy Teaching Clinic and other community sites. Students receive a professional certificate in massage therapy upon successful completion. ==Academics== The master's degree programs in acupuncture and Chinese medicine emphasize the mind, body and spirit ideals from traditional Chinese medicine. CACM has gathered a multi-national faculty. The curriculum for the Master of Chinese Medicine program provides about 3,000 hours of didactic and clinical instruction in acupuncture, Chinese herbology, and related studies such as Tui Na, Qigong, introductory Chinese language skills and practice management. The program takes three years of full-time enrollment to complete. The curriculum for the Master of Acupuncture program is similar to that of the Oriental medicine program, but does not include herbal studies. This program includes more than 2,300 hours of instruction, taking two and two-thirds years of full- time enrollment to complete. The Master of Acupuncture and Master of Chinese Medicine programs offered by the University are accredited by the Accreditation Commission for Acupuncture and Chinese Medicine. The Doctor of Chiropractic program offered by the University is accredited by the Commission for Accreditation of the Council on Chiropractic education. The full-time day program consists of more than 4,300 credit hours over 10 trimesters. The students may also complete a bachelor of science degree in human biology while enrolled in the chiropractic program. == Campus == Northwestern Health Sciences University is located on a campus in suburban Bloomington. The main building was formerly a junior high school, but has since been renovated to accommodate the university containing laboratories, lecture halls, classrooms, a library, a bookstore, three public clinics, an auditorium, a cafeteria, a gymnasium, a research center, and a swimming pool. Construction projects include the addition of the Wolfe-Harris Center for Clinical Studies and the Greenawalt Library. The university is currently constructing a new academic facility called the Wolfe-Harris Center for Excellence. Founded on June 2, 1941, with just three students, Northwestern College of Chiropractic was first housed on the sixth floor of the W. T. Grant Department Store on Nicollet Avenue in downtown Minneapolis. The college quickly outgrew the space and relocated in 1949 to 2222 Park Ave. in Minneapolis. In 1974 Northwestern moved to a former Catholic grade school at 1834 Mississippi Blvd. in St. Paul. Over the next decade, the College continued to grow. By 1983 it had reached capacity and a new building was needed. Thanks to a $500,000 donation from Dan Gainey, a grateful chiropractic patient and owner of Jostens Inc., the college moved to its current site in Bloomington. == Students == Currently 941 students are taking classes at Northwestern. The chiropractic program has 683 students; the acupuncture and Chinese medicine program has 112, and the massage therapy program 64 students. Fifty-two percent of students on campus are female. In the acupuncture and Chinese medicine program, 78 percent of students are female; in the chiropractic program, 45 percent, and in the massage therapy program, 88 percent. Nine percent of students on campus are a minority or non-resident alien. In the acupuncture and Chinese medicine program, 9 percent of students are a minority or non-resident alien; in the chiropractic program, 7.7 percent, and in the massage therapy program, 9 percent. Currently 56 percent of students are from Minnesota. Other states with a significant number of students attending Northwestern include Wisconsin (13 percent), North Dakota (7.5 percent), South Dakota (5.6 percent), and Iowa (3 percent). A total of 27 states are represented at Northwestern. The average age of chiropractic students is 25.88. The average age for acupuncture and Chinese medicine students is 31.69. The average age for massage therapy students is 27.54. == Student activities == Northwestern Health Sciences University has numerous student clubs and organizations, which comprise groups of students who share a common interest, either social or professional. The organizations reflect a wide range of interests, including an array of professional, political, social and recreational groups. Included among these many organizations are networks for international students and women students, opportunities for public speaking and engagement in public affairs, as well as the study of chiropractic methods and philosophy. These organizations provide ready opportunities for participation in these and other special interests, and for personal and professional growth. The University also provides and sponsors extracurricular clubs and activities throughout the year including aerobics, baseball, basketball, soccer, mountain biking, skiing, and martial arts. == Research == Northwestern Health Sciences University‚Äôs Wolfe-Harris Center for Clinical Studies, located on the Bloomington campus, houses a natural health care research center. The Center‚Äôs two newest studies, focusing on back-related leg pain and integrative care for low back pain, pushed the University over the $7 million mark in total funding from federal agencies over the institutions entire history (since 1941). In addition, Northwestern Health Sciences University‚Äôs research efforts are now being expanded to the other academic programs on campus.

It shares its power plant with the YBR125 and its supermotard brother, the Yamaha XT125X. While parts such as the transmission and chassis are produced in Japan, and the engine in Brazil, the motorcycle itself is assembled in Bologna, Italy for the European market by the Italian bike company Malaguti. The 21-inch front wheel and the 18-inch rear with enduro-style tires make it fit for both on- and off-road use. Seat height and ground clearance are higher compared to the Supermotard version and the machine features the typical dual-purpose handling characteristics, which makes it suitable for a wide range of duties, from crossing rough city roads to small country lanes or paths. The XT range debuted in 1976 with the XT500 single four-stroke \\"torque hammer\\". Later, other models followed spreading from XT125 to the latest XT660. Both the XT and DT ranges represent the typical Yamaha model development consistency, with model refinements over a long period of time. The XT 125R has an electronic display with different selectable modes: numbered RPM, lap timer, mileage, average speed, clock and trip distance. The standard display is a bar displayed rev-counter along with a speed reading. Lights on the side of the display indicate high beam and low beam, low fuel, indicators and neutral.

The A54 runs through the village, connecting it to the railway station at Winsford. At the 2011 census, it had a population of 153. In 2015, the civil parish amalgamated with Wimboldsley to form Stanthorne and Wimboldsley. ==History== Stanthorne was a township in the ancient parish of Davenham and eventually became a civil parish in 1866. In the 1870s, Stanthorne was described as \\"a township in Davenham parish, Cheshire; 1 mile WNW of Middlewich. Acres, 1,062. Real property, ¬£2,438. Pop., 161. Houses, 27.\\" In 1936, a few boundary changes occurred, resulting in the addition of a few acres of Clive and Kinderton, but the loss of the 358 acres of Winsford. The buildings within Stanthorne include eleven Grade II listed buildings. Stanthorne Hall was built between 1804‚Äì1807 by Richard Dutton and is a country house to the west of the village. Another Grade II listed building is Stanthorne Mill on the River Wheelock. This is an ancient mill site and some of the mill machinery is still present in the interior. ==Population and housing== Population of Stanthorne between 1881 and 2011 In 1881, Stathorne had a population of 193. The population stayed at a steady point up until after 1921 when there was a dramatic increase resulting in an overall population of 290. However, in the years to follow the population steadily decreased and reached an all-time low of 136 in 1951. Since 1951 the population of Stanthorne has not increased or decreased severely. The gender ratio of Stanthorne at the present time is very equal, with 82 males and 71 females. The majority of houses in Stanthorne are detached. A greater percentage of the population live as a couple with no dependent children, only 41 people out of the 153 do not live as a couple in Stanthorne. The population density of Stanthorne is 0.5 people per hectare. ==Geography== River Wheelock The River Wheelock runs through the civil parish of Stanthorne. \\"Wheelock\\" is derived from the Old Welsh language and means 'winding river'. The river is very small and drains water from the area of Sandbach and Crewe. The river is very popular for fishing in the area and attracts local and distant fishermen. The soil is made up of partly sand and partly clay. ==Transport== In January 2013 proposals were brought forward for the nearby towns of Winsford and Middlewich to be bisected by a new High Speed Two rail line. The proposed route would cut through the parish of Stanthorne. Many resident associations and various wildlife organisations are against the new line as it could cause high levels of disruption not just socially but also environmentally in the local area. So far no final decision has been made on the building of the new line. ==Notable people== Charles Dickens once stayed at Stanthorne Hall during the 1800s, as this is around the time the author wrote Great Expectations it is believed that the character of Miss Havisham was inspired by a spinster who lived in Stanthorne at the time. It is thought that a young woman who lived in Stanthorne lodge unmarried and alone was very similar to the character of Miss Havisham. However, there is much controversy over the story and many competing claims argue that the inspiration originated elsewhere. ==See also== *Listed buildings in Stanthorne *Stanthorne Hall ==References== ==External links== Category:Villages in Cheshire Category:Former civil parishes in Cheshire Category:Cheshire West and Chester ","title":"Stanthorne"},{"id":"9112950","text":"S√∂dra Bankgr√§nd in February 2007.

No More Kings' music is known for its frequent references to figures in pop culture, most notably Johnny Lawrence from The Karate Kid, Michael and K.I.T.T. from Knight Rider, Johnny 5 from Short Circuit, and Dungeons and Dragons. The band's songs are written by Mitchell along with his longtime friend Neil Robins of the Louisville-based band Dirt Poor Robins. The name \\"No More Kings\\" comes from an episode of Schoolhouse Rock!, one of many of No More Kings' inspirations. The particular episode dealt with the Pilgrims leaving England, seeking freedom and independence. Pete studied fine art in college and has worked for Disney and the Jim Henson Company; he is an accomplished animator and also speaks Japanese. He designed the interior album art for the band's first album as well as the album art and packaging for their second album. Pete claims his main sources of musical inspiration are the Beatles, Michael Jackson, Radiohead, Billy Joel, Beck, and Genesis. ==Music videos Sweep the Leg=== No More Kings received much of their exposure from their 2007 music video \\"Sweep the Leg\\", which incorporates elements of the 1984 film The Karate Kid and features appearances by nearly the entire original cast,. Martin Kove reprises his role as Sensei Kreese, and actors who played the Cobra Kai members in the 1984 film, Ron Thomas, Rob Garrison, and Tony O'Dell are also part of the cast. William Zabka, who played villain Johnny Lawrence in the film, directed the video. Pat E. Johnson, who was the martial arts director for the film as well as the martial arts director for Bruce Lee, worked on this video. Dennis Haskins and Liza Snyder also make an appearance. \\"Sweep the Leg\\" was also featured on Sony's MLB 08: The Show. The premise for the music video finds Zabka and members of his Cobra Kai gang living in a trailer in the desert, having become obsessed with the fight he lost years ago. He is haunted by No More Kings and chases Mitchell across the desert until they have a final showdown at the All Valley Under-18 Karate Championships. Johnny then claims victory, but after realizing it was a fantasy, he is run over by Ralph Macchio as Mitchell looks on. The music video references not only The Karate Kid, but also the 1986 film Back to School (which also stars Zabka), the 1987 film Raising Arizona, and the 1984 video for The Cars song, \\"You Might Think.\\" There are various versions of the video, the longest being a little over seven minutes. The video was a collaboration between No More Kings‚Äô record label Astonish Records, and Chapter Seven Films, a film company in Los Angeles. \\"Sweep the Leg\\" received over 80,000 views within its first week of release and became the number one video on YouTube on March 16, 2007. It was featured on MySpace's most-viewed lists, earned nearly a million views on YouTube, and was mentioned on VH1's \\"Best Week Ever\\" online. In 2008, Astonish Records released a special collector's edition CD/DVD. ===Michael=== In 2008, No More Kings followed up the video for \\"Sweep the Leg\\" with \\"Michael (Jump In)\\", which was animated by San Francisco animation company GhostBot. In \\"Michael (Jump In)\\", lead singer Pete Mitchell is a hero-wannabe who attempts to help people, but just makes things worse. The main character in the video is trying to be like Michael, from the show Knight Rider. ==History Origins=== Pete Mitchell and Neil DeGraide started No More Kings by themselves in the 1990s, and were later joined by Adam DeGraide (bass). They broke up in the late 1990s, but reformed in 2006 when Adam DeGraide started a record label called Astonish Records and signed them. Since the band's reformation, musicians are often added and interchanged according to tours and albums. Pete Mitchell is the band's lead singer and occasionally plays the guitar or piano for shows. He writes songs with Neil Robins, who produces their albums and plays a majority of the instruments. ==All The Kings Men== All The Kings Men is the publicity street team for the band No More Kings, which helps in bringing friends to the shows, phoning local radio stations to request the band's songs, putting up posters, and posting to band forums or related bulletin boards online. The name was selected out of hundreds of suggestions by street team members, and came from fan Alicia King. ==Discography== * No More Kings, released on March 6, 2007. The band's self-titled debut album has a pop atmosphere and focuses on pop culture and literary references. Knight Rider, The Karate Kid, the Smurfs, Gulliver's Travels, characters from Peanuts, the Beastie Boys, Darth Vader, Fonzie, M.C. Hammer, Archie Bunker, Ghostbusters II, Adam and Eve, and Gene Kelly are all mentioned throughout the album. Well-known songs by the band include \\"Michael (Jump In)\\", \\"Sweep The Leg\\", and \\"Zombie Me\\". Lead singer Pete Mitchell described the album as \\"a thank-you letter to the 80s\\". In early 2008, No More Kings won in The 7th Annual Independent Music Awards for Best Pop Album.Independent Music Awards - 7th Annual Winners * And the Flying Boombox, released on May 12, 2009. No More Kings' follow-up album presents quite a different atmosphere, but brings back the pop culture references including Vincent Barbarino from Welcome Back Kotter, MySpace, Dungeons and Dragons, Hollywood Squares, Lewis and Clark, Run-D.M.C., Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, Short Circuit, and Merlin and Arthur from Arthurian Legend. The album produced singles, \\"Obey the Groove\\" and \\"Dance Alone.\\" *III, released on April 9, 2014 III is the latest album produced by the group in 2013. Following the release of several singles, the group published their 3rd album containing all their newer works, plus a new song called \\"Tracy's Song\\". This album contained works such as \\"They're Coming To Get You Barbara\\" (a reference to the 1968 zombie film Night of the Living Dead), and the \\"Zombie Me Apocamix\\" a remix on their popular track from the first album. ==Notes== ==External links== * No More Kings Official Website * No More Kings at MySpace * No More Kings YouTube page * Official \\"Sweep the Leg\\" video website * Pete Mitchell's Interview Show on LiveVideo.com * * An interview with Pete Mitchell on Notebook on Cities and Culture Category:Rock music groups from California Category:Independent Music Awards winners Category:American pop rock music groups Category:Musical groups from Los Angeles Category:Musical groups established in 2006 ","title":"No More Kings"},{"id":"9113007","text":"Mian Mahmud Ali Kasuri (1910‚Äì1987) was a prominent Pakistani opposition politician, human rights advocate and lawyer who became a Senior Advocate Supreme Court.

Diario de la Marina was Cuba‚Äôs longest-running newspaper and the one with the highest circulation. Its roots went back to 1813 with El Lucero de la Habana (The Havana Star) and the Noticioso Mercantil (The Mercantile Seer) whose 1832 merger established El Noticioso y Lucero de la Habana, which was renamed Diario de la Marina in 1844. Though a conservative publication, its pages gave voice to a wide range of opinions, including those of avowed communists. It gave a platform to essayist Jorge Ma√±ach and many other distinguished Cuban intellectuals. Over its long history La Marina represented a conservative philosophy that from 1902 to 1959, opposing the dictatorships of Gerardo Machado in the 1930s and Fulgencio Batista in the 1950s. Its valiant attempt to maintain that tradition of opposition under Castro included being the only newspaper that published the letters denouncing the Castro regime written by Revolutionary Commander Huber Matos from prison after his October 1959 arrest for ‚Äúcounter- revolutionary treason‚Äù. 1953, the Diario had a circulation of 28,000 weekdays and 35,000 on Sundays, with 36 to 48 pages, selling for five cents. Its audience was government officials and the upper and middle classes. During 1930-1933, the editorial page cartoonist was Eduardo Abela and during the 1950s it was Jose Manuel Rose√±ada The newspaper was published in exile in Miami, Florida, from 1960 until 1961, when it ceased publication. Soon after the Cuban Revolution led by Fidel Castro that overthrew the Cuban government in 1959, all media - radio, television, and print - underwent a censorship process. Some communications sources were altered while others were closed. Diario La Marina, due to its anti-Castro position (it had opposed Castro's efforts since well before the revolution) was closed on May 12, 1960, by orders of the government. Armed militiamen and State Security (G2) agents dressed in civilian clothes entered the office premises, expelled employees and vandalized the premises. In-house printers were given a revolutionary tract to publish. The following day, Chief Editor Jose Ignacio Rivero sought political asylum at the Peruvian Embassy. After 128 years, the newspaper had ceased operations. ==Other publications== When Prensa Libre wrote critically about the suppression of Diario de la Marina and the imminent loss of freedom of the press in Cuba, it too was seized by the government. Revolutionary mobs, incited by the frenzy of the moment, calling for execution of all the editors who opposed Castro and his Revolution. One by one, Cuban newspapers ceased publication. Only government-controlled publications, like Revoluci√≥n, El Mundo, Bohemia, and the communist Hoy were allowed to publish but even they were eventually phased out. After the firm establishment of the regime and the supremacy of the Communist Party, only Granma the official organ of the Cuban Communist Party, was allowed to exist.Dr. Miguel A.

Swann (born July 30, 1931) is an American church and concert organist, choral conductor, composer, recording artist, and former president of the American Guild of Organists. He is the former Director of Music and Organist at New York City's Riverside Church and Organist Emeritus of the Crystal Cathedral and the First Congregational Church of Los Angeles. Playing the Crystal Cathedral organ on the weekly Hour of Power television program, he was reportedly seen by an audience of 20 million viewers in 165 countries. Critics such as Tim Smith have called Swann \\"one of the country's most distinguished organists\\". Other critics have praised his playing as \\"brilliant\\" and \\"masterly\\", having a \\"commanding sense of pace and color\\". The New York Times said his performance at a Riverside Church recital in 2006, \\"demonstrated that organists are complete athletes, needing both lightning- fast fingers and the fleet footwork of a dancer\\". Swann lives in Palm Desert, California, where he has been Artist-in-residence at St. Margaret's Episcopal Church since 2001. He was also formerly University Organist and Organ Professor at the University of Redlands prior to his retirement in 2018. ==Early years and education== Frederick Swann was born in Lewisburg, West Virginia, in 1931, shortly before his family moved to Virginia. The son of Methodist pastor (and later bishop) Theodore M. Swann and Mary Davis Swann, he began taking piano lessons as a from the organist at Market Street Methodist Church in Winchester, Virginia. One day he arrived early for a lesson and saw his teacher playing the organ. He told an interviewer in later years that he was \\"mesmerized when I saw the organ console for the first time\\" and soon began taking organ lessons. When he was ten years old, the organist at Braddock Street Methodist Church, where his father was pastor (1937-1943), died suddenly. Young \\"Freddie\\" (as he was then known), was called upon to play the organ for the Sunday services. Madeline W. Riley, the church's Minister of Music, was of significant influence in helping him develop the service playing skills for which he has become so well known. Swann's oldest brother, Edgar, an organist and ordained clergyman, was killed in action early in World War II. Another brother and three sisters are also deceased. The Swann family moved to Staunton, Virginia, in 1943 and the youthful organist continued organ study with Dr. Carl Broman, professor of music at Mary Baldwin College and organist at Trinity Episcopal Church. After graduating from Robert E. Lee High School, where he played the piano for the school's chorus, Swann attended Northwestern University. He earned degrees in music from Northwestern University and the old School of Sacred Music at Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York, where he studied with Hugh Porter and Charles M. Courboin. Both degrees were granted \\"with distinction\\". After a 15-month stint as interim organist at New York's Brick Presbyterian Church during the illness of the renowned Clarence Dickinson, while concurrently serving as Harold Friedell's assistant at St. Bartholomew's Episcopal Church, Swann entered the U.S. Army for a two-year stint. ==Career as an organist== Swann was associated with the music ministry of the famed Riverside Church in New York City from 1952 through 1982, first as a substitute organist for Virgil Fox and then appointed Organist in 1957, when Fox's appearances at Riverside became infrequent until his departure in 1965 to pursue a full-time career as a concert performer. Upon the retirement of Richard Weagly as Choir Director in 1966, Swann became Director of Music and Organist through 1982. Under the direction of Swann (and his successor, John Walker), Riverside's music program continued to flourish in the 1960s-1980s.Paris etal., The History of the Riverside Church in the City of New York, p. 106. The Crystal Cathedral organ Beginning in June, 1982, Swann was appointed Director of Music and Organist at the Crystal Cathedral (now Christ Cathedral) in Garden Grove, California, where he conducted the choir and presided over the 5-manual, 265-rank Hazel Wright organ of 16,000 pipes, appearing weekly on the internationally televised Hour of Power worship services. He also performed at weekly noonday recitals and major concerts. His performances were characterized by music critic Daniel Cariaga as \\"splendid, probing, brilliant and entertaining\\". Swann told the Los Angeles Times years later that he was initially criticized in some professional organist quarters for leaving the prestigious, Gothic cathedral-like Riverside Church in New York for the Crystal Cathedral, saying he was \\"practically blackballed\\", but that he felt quite comfortable with his decision and found the Christian theology at both churches differing only in emphasis. Swann then began serving as organist of the First Congregational Church of Los Angeles in September, 1998, playing the largest church organ in the world. The instrument has more than 20,000 individual pipes. He left this position on July 30, 2001 -- his 70th birthday. As a concert organist, he has performed at recitals throughout North America, Europe and the Far East. Past appearances include Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, St. Paul's Cathedral and Westminster Abbey in London, and Cologne and Passau Cathedrals in Germany. Swann has performed over 3,000 recitals in his long career -- in all 50 states of the U.S. and 12 other countries. Swann is known for dedicating new organs in churches, concert halls, and auditoriums during his career, such as Orchestra Hall in Chicago, Illinois, with the Chicago Symphony in 1981 and at Davies Symphony Hall in San Francisco, California, with the San Francisco Symphony in 1984. On September 9, 2003, he dedicated the largest church organ in Asia, located in YounDong Presbyterian Church, in Seoul, Korea, having 104 stops, 119 ranks, and 6,820 pipes, The following year, on September 30, 2004, Swann was chosen to perform the inaugural concert of the 6,125-pipe organ of the Los Angeles Philharmonic at Walt Disney Concert Hall. A month later, he performed at the largest pipe organ in the island nation of Bermuda, playing the 88-rank organ of St. Paul's Anglican Church there in a concert broadcast by Sacred Classics. At age 85 in 2016, Swann announced his retirement as a concert organist with a series of programs beginning in August of that year at the Kotzschmar Organ in Portland, Maine. His performance was praised by music critic Allan Kozinn of the Portland Press Herald as possessing a \\"commanding sense of pace and color\\". Swann's playing of Bach‚Äôs Prelude and Fugue in G (BWV 541) was called \\"masterly ... notable for both the vigor he brought to the Prelude and the textural transparency with which he illuminated the fugue\\". His final recital on the retirement tour took place at the First Presbyterian Church of Kilgore, Texas, fittingly on the 50th anniversary of his dedicatory recital on that very organ. He continues as Artist-in-residence at St. Margaret's Episcopal Church in Palm Desert, California, as of . ==Teaching== Swann served on the adjunct faculties of New York City's Guilmant Organ School, the Union Theological Seminary School of Sacred Music, and Teacher's College of Columbia University. For ten years, he chaired the Organ Department of the Manhattan School of Music. In later years, he was University Organist and Artist Teacher of Organ at the University of Redlands in California (2007-2018). ==AGO role and various awards== Swann joined the American Guild of Organists (AGO) in 1946. After serving in various offices, he was elected in 2002 to the first of three consecutive two-year terms as president of the 25,000-member organization. Also in 2002, he was named \\"International Performer of the Year\\" by the New York City Chapter of the AGO. On April 13, 2008, the AGO saluted him at an AGO Gala recital at First Congregational Church in Los Angeles as the \\"Crown Prince of the King of Instruments\\" for his \\"dedicated service ... for more than a half century\\". At the AGO's July, 2010, national convention in Washington, D.C., Swann was presented the Edward Hansen Award for Outstanding Leadership by the organization's vice president, John Walker. In 2015, the Royal Canadian College of Organists named Swann a Fellow, honoris causa and in 2018 the AGO honored him as the organization's first honoris causa recipient of its \\"Fellow\\" degree (i.e., FAGO). Following eleven years as organist and organ professor at the University of Redlands, Swann received the honorary Doctor of Music degree from the California university upon his retirement in April, 2018. ==Published works== Swann's published compositions include more than three dozen anthems for choir, such as Let the Whole Creation Cry, as well as numerous organ works based on hymn tunes, such as Hymns of Praise and Power. His arrangements of familiar hymns include Amazing Grace, Great is Thy Faithfulness, How Great Thou Art, Fairest Lord Jesus and O God Our Help in Ages Past. His widely performed Trumpet Tune in D Major was composed in 1991.

The first stage of the project was a twenty-station stretch between the city center and Lagunen Storsenter, where the first 15 stations comprising a stretch opened in 2010, and the second was a stretch from Nesttun to Lagunen which opened in June 2013. A third stretch from Lagunen to Bergen Airport, Flesland opened in 2017.https://www.skyss.no/nn-NO/Verdt-a-vite/Nytt-fra-Skyss/lengre- bybanevogner/ Further plans for the project involve mooted extensions to √Ösane and Storavatnet. Plans for rail transit have existed since the 1970s, following the 1965 closing of the Bergen Tramway. A rapid transit design was first discarded, and in the 1990s a light rail line was proposed. The decision to start construction was made in 2005. The first stage was built by the municipality, with financing from the state and the toll road ring, based on the Bergen Program. Ownership, maintenance and further extensions and vehicles are the responsibility of Hordaland County Municipality through its wholly owned subsidiary Bybanen AS. Operation is governed by public service obligation contracts issued by the county public transport authority Skyss. From 2010 to 2017 the line and its 20 Variobahn trams were operated by Keolis Norge (formerly Fjord1 Partner). ==HistoryBackground=== The first public transport in Bergen was the Bergen Tramway, which operated between 1897 and 1965. It was limited to the inner parts of the city and did not reach the suburbs. The city council therefore decided to close it, arguing that the future lay in private cars, diesel buses and trolleybuses. In the 1960s, the removal on restriction on car sales created more traffic than the roads could handle and consequently both buses and cars began increasingly being stuck in rush-hour queues. The municipality and the Norwegian Public Roads Administration started looking at rectifying the situation by building a ring road around the city, and by alternative means of public transport. Prior to the shortening of the main Bergen Line railway with the Ulriken Tunnel, the Bergen‚ÄìNesttun Line was an important commuter rail service, feeding suburban residents from Fana into the city center. In 1917, the section was the most heavily trafficked railway in the country, with a travel time between 20 and 27 minutes. There were up to 27 trains per day, of which five continued to Garnes. In 1918, the line was proposed for doubling and electrification: the latter was completed in 1954. The same year, annual ridership were down to 870,000 passengers. After the opening of the Ulriken Tunnel commuter trains were kept for six months, with the last trip ran on 31 January 1965. During the 1970s, plans had existed for an extensive rapid transit system, with an underground section in the city center. Inspired by the successful Oslo Metro that had opened in 1966, similar plans were developed. The proposed network was close to the current long-term plans for the light rail system, and consisted of three branches from the city center to Flaktveit, Olsvik and the airport. Four-car trains would operate at ten-minute headways. The suggestion was discussed by the city council in 1973, but no decision was taken. As an alternative, expansion of the railway from Bergen to Eidsv√•g, √Ösane and Nesttun was proposed. Fast commuter trains could then be supplemented with buses. Natur og Ungdom in favor of light rail During the 1980s and 1990s, a toll ring was constructed around Bergen to finance a massive investment in motorways. This included European Route E39 north and south of the center, the road to the airport, and west to Loddefjord and Storavatnet. Bridges were constructed to Lind√•s, Ask√∏y and Sotra, and large parking garages were built in the city center. Despite this congestion continued, and it was no better in the 2000s than in the 1970s. Proposals to build bus lanes and traffic signal preemption was disregarded by the Public Roads Administration. In 1995, the municipal bus company Bergen Sporvei made a proposal to establish what they called the Lightning Tram, from Varden in Fyllingsdalen via a tunnel to M√∏hlenpris and the city center, then make a 120¬∞ turn and return along the route of the Bergen trolleybus to Birkelundstoppen. The same year, the Norwegian Society for the Conservation of Nature proposed a more extensive system, the Environmental Tram, which more closely resembles the current proposals. From the city center, it would run northwards via √Ösane to Flaktveit and southwards via R√•dal to the airport (not via Nesttun). The southern section would have branches from Hop to Nesttun and Midttun, and from Minde westwards to Fyllingsdalen and Loddefjord. Later, Bergen Sporvei's successor, Gaia Trafikk, proposed building a bus rapid transit. ===Political process=== The plans launched by the city administration most closely resembled the Environmental Tram, with slight changes. The initial plans involved a line from the city center via Nesttun to the airport at Flesland. It became part of a political compromise, the Bergen Program, which ensured a number of road investments at the same time as the light rail system, all financed through the toll ring. However, a lack of funds made it necessary to build the line to Nesttun only, instead of all the way to the airport. The initial decision was taken by Bergen City Council on 13 March 2000, in the Parliament of Norway in 2002, and with the financing secured, by the city council in 2005. Only the Progress Party and the Pensioners' Party voted against light rail. Forty per cent is financed by the state, the remainder by the county, the municipality and through the toll ring. Construction at Nesttun Terminal The arguments for light rail were mainly related to the environment, urban development and reduction in road congestion. Light rail is estimated to increase the use of public transport from Fana, reducing both local and global pollution. The roads do not have capacity for further growth, and any increase in public transport would need to be taken along the light rail routes on buses‚Äîthis would give higher operating costs for public transport or higher investment costs for roads. Around the stations, high- density commercial and residential centers can be established. Opponents of the project argued that it is unfair that public transport be funded by car drivers through toll roads. Protests from people in northern and western areas of the city have risen, since they are paying for the system but will not receive the benefits. Another issue has been speed: the line to Nesttun has 15 stops in , giving an average speed of . For people living south of Nesttun, this will give a longer travel time to the city center than with direct buses that do not make intermediate stops. The naming of the stations caused local debate. A draft for names were made by the municipal administration and then sent to the borough councils in Fana, √Örstad and Bergenhus. Four names were changed: Nonneseteren from Jernbanen, Florida from Str√∏mmen, Brann stadion from Nymark and Hop from Troldhaugen. Brann stadion and Troldhaugen were afterwards considered by the municipal administration, because they could be in violation of the Place Name Act. The general rule is to use the place name where the station is located, and naming after institutions or facilities nearby is not permitted unless they are in the immediate vicinity. Brann stadion, named for the football venue, was declared a borderline case, but within the rules, while Troldhaugen was not permitted because the area is not in the vicinity of the station. Construction near Kronstad during 2008 ===Construction=== Initial works commenced in August 2007, when Pastasentralen was demolished to make room for a temporary bus terminal that would allow Kaigaten to be closed for construction. Contracts for building the line were awarded to Svein Boasson, NCC Construction, Fyllingen Maskinstasjon and Veidekke Entrepren√∏r. The contract for laying the tracks was awarded to Baneservice. Construction started in January 2008. To pass over Str√∏mmen, a fourth Nyg√•rd Bridge was built for cars, and the oldest was upgraded and used by the light rail line. In several places the road needed to be dug up to remove pipes and cables. In November 2009, Gulating Court of Appeal ruled that the power company BKK had to pay 80 million NOK for the moving of power lines, and could not charge the costs to the project. By June 2008, the first tracks had been laid. Four companies bid for the initial public service obligation to operate the line: Fjord1 Partner, Norges Statsbaner, Tide Bane and Veolia Transport Norge. On 3 April 2009, the public transport agency Skyss announced that Fjord1 Partner, a joint venture between Fjord1 AS and Keolis, had won the tender competition. Fjord1 Partner received 324 applications for their 26 jobs as drivers and 10 jobs as traffic controllers. In 2014 Fjord1 AS sold their shares in Fjord1 Partner to Keolis, and the company changed its name to Keolis Norge AS. Along with the establishment of the light rail service, the public transport in Bergen underwent other changes. Skyss was established in 2007 to administer the public transport system, manage routes and market public transport, which would be operated by private companies based on public service obligations. At the same time, a new electronic ticketing system was introduced. Because of delays from Stadler's subcontractors, five instead of eight trams were available when the line opened on 22 June 2010. Skyss had planned to operate with a ten-minute headway until August, but had a 15-minute headway until 16 August. To compensate, none of the parallel bus routes ceased until then. On 7 June, two trams collided at low speed at Byparken, causing a derailment and forced the two trams to be repaired. This caused the summer schedule to be reduced to a 30-minute headway. From 1 November, the line started running every six minutes during the rush hour. On 22 June, the first part of the line was officially opened by Queen Sonja of Norway. ==Route== Brann stadion in Inndalsveien The first part of the line is and runs from the city center to Nesttun. The northernmost part of the line, Byparken Terminal, is a transit mall at the heart of the city center and has interchange with all buses serving the city center. The line runs south along Kaigaten, with Nonneseter stop serving the railway station and Bystasjonen serving the bus station. Southwards, the line runs in a grass right-of-way through Nyg√•rd and Florida, serving the campus of the University of Bergen. The line passes over Nyg√•rd Bridge before coming to Danmarks plass, the only island platform on the system. In this area, the track is on maize, a type of surface that allows emergency vehicles to drive safely, but makes the surface look unsafe for cars. The line passes the depot at Kronstad before reaching Kronstad stop, almost at the door of the Bergen University College. From here, the line follows Inndalsveien, where Brann Stadion stop serves the Brann Stadion football venue. Wergeland is at the mouth of the Fager√•stunnelen, S-shaped with a 6.0% gradient and a curve radius of . From the southern portal the line changes to conventional railway track with ballast, allowing trams to operate at . The next stops are Sletten, Slettebakken and Fantoft, the later serving a large complex of student dormitories. Southwards is the Fantoft Tunnel, followed by Paradis stop. The line continues along the Nesttunvannet inlet to Hop, along the former right-of-way of Bergen's first motorway. Nesttun Terminal was the terminus until the extension to Lagunen was finished. After the completion to Nesttun, the line was extended southwards to R√•dal at Lagunen Storsenter. Construction began in January 2011, on its own right-of- way parallel to the existing road;, the track was completed in October 2012. The first test run to Lagunen was conducted on 6 December 2012, and the line was opened to the public on 22 June 2013. The light rail line along Inndalsveien The light rail is now connected from Lagunen via Kokstad to Bergen Airport, Flesland. Both S√∏r√•s and Indre Steinsvik have experienced rapid housing construction without a corresponding increase of public transport. Further out is a large corporate center with many of Bergen's largest employers, such as Telenor, Equinor and BKK. The area was built without sufficient roads or public transport, and has among the worst road congestion in the urban area. Building the light rail line to Flesland supplements the airport shuttles and offer cheaper service for locals and employees at the airport. Another incentive to build to Flesland was that there was sufficient available land which allows a large depot to be constructed. After the line was opened to Lagunen, there was insufficient space at Kronstad to house additional trams. The line to the airport opened in 2017. == Plans == Plans for the expansion northwards from the city center to √Ösane involve either building the system to replace many of the local buses operating in Sandviken, or make the light rail line an express service. If the latter is chosen, the line will bypass Bryggen in a tunnel and make few stops before √Ösane. An important stop mid-way is the Norwegian School of Economics. The terminus will probably be √Ösane Senter or Nyborg; the former shopping center has set aside areas for a station. At √Ösane, a major bus terminal would allow connections to the northern parts of Bergen, suburbs further north and areas in Nordhordland. An important political argument for prioritizing this line is to spread out the investments to all parts of the city, since the line is being financed by taxpayers and car-users throughout the city. Slettebakken The third planned expansion runs from the city center southwards, east of the Center‚ÄìNesttun Line, serving Haukeland University Hospital. It then heads west, intersecting with the first line at Kronstad, runs through a tunnel before serving the areas of Fyllingsdalen. The line can use parts of the Norwegian National Rail Administration's right of way from the city center to Kronstad, and would feature a station under the hospital, which is Western Norway's largest work place. It is not planned an extension to Loddefjord and Storavatnet from Fyllingsdalen at this time because the time of travel will be much higher than the direct bus line using the highway to the city center. A project group with members of the Norwegian Public Roads Administration and the National Rail Administration have proposed that instead of rebuilding the Ulriken Tunnel to double track, a new double-track light rail tunnel could be built from the city center to Arna. This would allow the light rail line to replace the two-station Bergen Commuter Rail service, and give better access to the city center for people from Arna. Several politicians, including the majority in Hordaland County Council, have stated that in the long run they want the light rail line extended northwards to Knarvik and westwards to Straume and Kleppest√∏. ==Operation== Nonneseteren station on the Bergen Light Rail The building of the line is the responsibility of Bybanen Utbygging, which is an agency within Hordaland County. The physical infrastructure and trams are owned by Bybanen AS, a limited company wholly owned by Hordaland County. This company is responsible for maintenance of the right-of-way and the vehicles, and for extensions. Light rail operations are based on contracts granted after public tender competitions held by Skyss, a county agency that administers all public transport in Hordaland, including buses, boats and ferries. From 2010 to 2017, with the possibility for a two-year extension, the line will be operated by Keolis Norge AS. Stadler has the responsibility for maintenance of the trams for the first seven years, as part of the purchase contract. The line is operated on a four/five-minute headway by all-stops trams, with an eight-minute headway in off-peak times and a 20 minutes headway at night. Travel time from Byparken to Lagunen is 32 minutes. In 2015, the full price of a single ticket is NOK 35. Tickets are valid with free transfer to buses in Bergen. ==Rolling stock== Tram 201 being delivered at Kronstad on 8 December 2009, the morning after it arrived in Bergen In 2007, the Planning Office ordered 12 Variobahn trams from Stadler Rail, with an additional four on option. The first tram arrived on 7 December 2009, and was used for testing in the months leading up to the opening. Before the opening, three more trams were in place. The trams are long and wide, weighing . They have five articulated sections, and are expandable with another two modules to a length of , should higher capacity be necessary. All stations are built for extended trams. There is a slightly elevated driver's cab at each end. Eight motors provide a total of for three bogies. This allows a maximum speed of , limited to in city streets and in the depots. Acceleration is 1.25 m/s2 (4.13 ft/s2), and they are capable of operating on a 7.0% gradient. Current is collected via a pantograph, at 750 volts direct current. Each tram is sufficiently powerful to haul another unit in case of emergencies. Capacity is for 212 passengers, of which 84 can sit four abreast. The entire tram is step-free, including between the cars and the platforms. Seats are designed for travel times up to 60 minutes. There are four slide and plug doors on each side; three are double, with a total width of , while the last is a single door. Stop buttons are only available at the doors; this has been chosen to speed alighting times. Between the seats there is a minimum width of , which allows wheelchair and buggy access along the full length of the car. All stations are announced visually and orally. The trams have wireless Internet access. All stations are announced with a short distinctive melody and the station's name. The melodies were composed by Snorre Valen, while the voice was recorded by Heidi Lambach. Currently there are 28 Variobahn trams in operation, with six additional trams on order, scheduled to be delivered by the end of 2021. ==Infrastructure== Danmarksplass The system is standard gauge with -wide cars, with the platforms built to allow long trams. The line has no terminal balloon loops, so trams must be bi-directional. The current is supplied from six rectifiers, specified so the system can operate with two rectifiers out of service. In the city center the overhead wire has been designed to minimize the number of poles, while in the suburban areas a conventional system has a carrier wire above the power wire. The line is double track, allowing visual signaling and speed adjustment on all at-grade stretches. In city streets S60 track is used; on private right-of-way, S49 track. The minimum curve radius is and tracks in city streets are laid within a rubber jacket to reduce noise. In the tunnels, only one tram can operate in each direction; this is regulated by lights and an automatic Train Protection system. Signaling uses the German BOStrab system, not traditional Norwegian light signals. The line has traffic signal preemption, so the trams send a signal to the traffic light control when the driver starts the door-closing signal to give the tram priority at traffic lights. The depot is at Kronstad, at a former yard used by the Norwegian State Railways, where a track that connects the light rail network to the Bergen Line. The depot was finished in 2009, and has room for 16 trams plus a workshop with space for two trams and a garage with place for three. There is sufficient area for further expansion, but tracks have not been laid. When the light rail line is expanded to Flesland, a new main depot is planned in an area with cheaper land, and Kronstad depot will be converted to a pure overnighting facility. ===Stations=== Brann stadion Fifteen stations were built for the first stage, and five for the second stage. The stations and the visual profile of the system as a whole are designed by the Bergen-based design groups Cubus and Fuggi Baggi Design, and Copenhagen-based Kontrapunkt. The stations of the first two stages are at street level, with facilities for buying tickets and dynamic displays that show when the next tram will arrive. The platforms have step-free access to the trams, allowing unhindered accessibility by wheelchairs and perambulators. The municipal government has permitted denser development around the stations, where it wants most new housing and commercial property to be built. Development projects for Slettebakken, Wergeland, Paradis and Lagunen have been announced by private developers. Many of the stations are in primarily residential areas, and the projects have met resistance from residents who fear that the character of their neighborhoods will be altered. ==References== ==External links== * Official site Category:Tram transport in Bergen Category:Light rail in Norway Category:Railway lines opened in 2010 Category:2010 establishments in Norway Category:Hordaland County Municipality Category:750 V DC railway electrification ","title":"Bergen Light Rail"},{"id":"9113103","text":"Scott Metcalfe (born January 6, 1967) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player, who played 19 games in the National Hockey League (NHL). ==Playing career== Metcalfe was born in Toronto, Ontario.

It is known also under the euphemistic name Semachot (), meaning \\"festive occasions\\" or \\"joys\\". == References in the Talmud == A collection of baraitot entitled \\"Evel Rabbati\\" is cited in the Talmud,Moed Kattan 24a, 26b; Ketuvot 28a which quotes three teachings from it. But this work is not identical with the work now known as Evel Rabbati, since only one of the three teachings in question is found even in an approximate form in Semahot.Ketubot 28a, compare to 2:13-14 ==The \\"Small\\" Evel == The designation \\"Evel Rabbati\\" in the Talmud suggests that a shorter treatise of similar content existed at the time of the amoraim, but probably the term \\"Rabbati\\" (the Large) was used merely because the collection of mourning regulations to which it was applied was more copious than that contained in the Mishnah.Moed Kattan 3 So much, however, is certain, that besides the treatise which is now known as Sema·∏•ot or Evel Rabbati there was an older collection of baraitot concerning funeral ordinances, and that the former was designated \\"Rabbati\\" to distinguish between the two. Natronai Gaon, answering the question \\"What is the Evel Rabbati?\\" said: \\"Evel is a treatise of the Mishnah in which are contained the regulations concerning mourning for the dead and most of the halakhic ordinances of the third chapter of Mo'ed Katan. There are two such: a large and a small one\\".In Edelmann, Hemdah Genuzah, No. 90; compare Arukh, s.v. Numerous fragments of the so-called \\"small\\" Evel treatise have been preserved, notably in Isaac ibn Ghayyat's Halakhot, in Nahmanides' Torat ha- Adam, in Tanya, and in Jacob b. Asher's Tur.See the comparison of these passages by Br√ºll in his Jahrb. 1:10-22 To judge from these fragments, the small Evel contained regulations concerning visitation of the sick, treatment of the dying, laying out of the corpse, mourning for the dead, arrangement of graves, and collection of the bones (\\"ossilegium\\"), which was customary among the Jews as well as among the Greeks. This treatise, which is the oldest collection of halakhot on mourning customs, was compiled in Palestine; and, according to Br√ºll,l.c. R. Eleazar Bar Zadok, who lived in Lod at the time of Gamaliel II, prepared its core. It was then amplified, enriched, and revised by R. ·∏§iyya, but as it was known to a small circle only, it was replaced by the later treatise Evel Rabbati, which borrowed much from it. == Evel Rabbati == The currently extant tractate Evel Rabbati, or Semachot, is a post-Talmudic product and originated in the Land of Israel. This explains the many overlaps of its contents with the baraitot of the Jerusalem Talmud. It is a compilation from various older works; and in many passages traces of revision are to be noticed. The compiler incorporated a considerable part of the small Evel, as well as much from other works, besides adding original matter. The late compilation date of the tractate may be seen from the use of the two Talmudim and from the character of the composition itself, which is unmistakable. The work reached Babylonia in the geonic period; and even at that time it received amplifications and additions from both Talmudim. It took on its present form probably in the middle of the 8th century,Br√ºll, l.c. p. 48 if not later. The work was comparatively widely circulated at the time of the later geonim, since reference to a passage in it is made in a question addressed to Sherira and Hai Gaon from a distant region. In their responsum to this question they call the tractate \\"Mishnatenu\\" = \\"our Mishnah\\".Na·∏•manides, Torat ha-Adam, p. 51a, Venice, 1598 Rashi had the work in its present form, since he explicitly cites as the commencement of the tractate the opening words of the present text. === Organization === The tractate is divided into 14 chapters, and this division dates from the 13th century at the latest, since Mordecai ben Hillel cites it by chapters.Mordekhai on Moed Katan 919, 926, 929 The tractate contains almost complete instructions as to the treatment of the dying and the dead, from the commencement of the death-agony to the arrangement of the grave which receives the remains. Numerous examples from current practice are cited. A large number of aggadot also are included. On the whole, it furnishes much valuable material for the study of Oriental antiquities in general and of ancient Jewish practices in particular, for the verification of historical facts, and for an understanding of the development of Jewish customs. The present text is defaced by many corruptions, so that its original form cannot now be determined. Wherever possible the commentators have made corrections on the basis of critical comparison, or have called attention to the corruptions. === Contents === The following is am outline of the tractate: *The first chapter is preceded by an aggadic introduction, inasmuch as it is considered desirable to begin so mournful a tractate with a teaching of a lighter character.Compare Br√ºll, l. c. p. 27, note 41 * Ch. 1: A person in the agony of death is regarded in every respect as fully alive (¬ß¬ß 1-8); mourning to be observed for heathen and slaves; other regulations concerning slaves.

(¬ß¬ß 9-14). * Ch. 2: Mourning customs to be observed for a suicide; cases in which a person found dead is to be regarded as a suicide (¬ß¬ß 1-6); mourning to be observed, for a person condemned and executed by a Jewish tribunal (¬ß¬ß 7-9); no mourning is to be observed, even by their nearest relatives, for persons who have renounced their nationality and their faith (¬ß 10); mourning to be observed for a person executed by a non-Jewish tribunal; other regulations (¬ß¬ß 11-14). * Ch. 3: The different burial customs, varying according to the age of the deceased. * Ch. 4: Cases in which a priest may handle a corpse, although he thereby loses his priestly purity. * Ch. 5: Mourners are prohibited from performing any work during the seven days of mourning; laws relating to excommunicants. * Ch. 6: What a mourner may and may not do during the seven days of mourning; what a person under a ban may not do; attitude of the community toward him. * Ch. 7: Nature of the thirty days' mourning. In connection therewith many other regulations are enumerated which have to do with terms of thirty days. * Ch. 8: Customs which one may observe, although they appear to be heathen customs; various proverbs, anecdotes, and historical narratives. * Ch. 9: Different mourning customs for different relatives and for different events. * Ch. 10: Mourning while the corpse is still in the house; mourning for scholars and princes; and other regulations. * Ch. 11: When two corpses are in the city, which of the two is to be buried first; the mourning of a wife for the relatives of her husband; signs of mourning to be displayed in the house of a mourner. * Ch. 12, 13: Regulations concerning ossilegium (see above); various other regulations, and anecdotes. * Ch. 14: Regulations concerning graves and the laying out of burial-places; the mourning feast in the house of the mourner. ==References== It has the following bibliography: *N.

As a result, he joined Real Madrid's youth team in these days AD Plus Ultra in the 1948-49 season. To improve and develop as a player he was transferred to H√©rcules CF and later to Real Murcia. He was called back by Real Madrid for his good performances at H√©rcules and Murcia, to join their first team squad. He made his official Real Madrid debut during the fourth match of the 1955‚Äì56 season where Cultural Leonesa were the opponents, in the time Real played their matches at the Estadio Chamart√≠n.

Like its predecessors, Judith features as its protagonist a young independent-minded woman who tries to make her way in a largely inhospitable and sometimes terrifying world. It was among Cleeve's most financially successful novels, especially in the United States.Bruce, Jim, Faithful Servant: A Memoir of Brian Cleeve Lulu, 2007, (p.192) ==Plot summary== It is 1799 and eighteen- year-old Judith Mortimer lives with her widowed father, Jonathan, on their farm in Essex. Jonathan Mortimer has devoted his adult life, and most of his money, to writing and publishing lengthy treatises on various subjects close to his heart. None has found favour with the reading public and, consequently, he and his daughter are close to penury. Several years earlier, Mortimer suffered a stroke and is confined to bed where he works on his latest project, A Treatise on Just Government. Meanwhile, his increasingly desperate daughter tries to find ways to keep the small household, including two servants, financially viable. She has entered into an agreement with a band of local smugglers to allow them use the farm's outhouses to store their merchandise. In return, the smugglers pay her ten to fifteen guineas each time they use the farm for their illegal purposes. Jonathan Mortimer is first cousin to a local earl and powerful landowner to whom he is in considerable debt. The debt arises from a legal dispute concerning their mutual grandfather's will. The earl wishes to buy the Mortimers' farm, which adjoins his own larger estate, and thereby clear their indebtedness to him. Under the proposed arrangement, Jonathan Mortimer will be allowed to live out his remaining days on the farm. Furthermore, the earl offers to give Judith a generous dowry so that she can marry. However, the catch is that she must marry the odious Mr. Massingham. She refuses the offer Robert Barnabas, son of the smugglers' leader, is in love with Judith and, during one of his nocturnal visits to the farm, he makes his feelings clear. Judith's emotions are thrown into turmoil by the handsome young man's directness. She learns that he was studying to be a doctor but abandoned it under pressure from his father to join the family 'business'. Now, as his love for Judith brings meaning to his life, he resolves to turn away from smuggling and complete his medical training. Not long after her refusal of the earl's offer, Judith's father dies. At the same time, news of her involvement with the smugglers reaches the local militia. She is forced to flee to London with Evergreen, an orphan gypsy girl whom she has taken into her care. There, the two young women unwittingly fall into the clutches of Mrs. Ware, who runs an 'academy' for young girls. Ostensibly set up to teach its occupants how to be ladies, Mrs. Ware's academy is, in reality, a high class brothel. Robert Barnabas pursues Judith to London and rescues her from Mrs. Ware's establishment. However, Massingham, furious and humiliated at Judith's refusal of his proposal of marriage, has also come to London seeking revenge. Together with his henchmen, he seizes Judith in the street and brings her to a lunatic asylum. There she is incarcerated for months in appalling conditions, naked and shackled in a cold cell. Massingham pays the asylum keeper to hold Judith until he feels she has learned her lesson. Eventually she is released onto the streets of London, her sanity barely intact and with nowhere to go. She is 'adopted' by a street urchin who takes her back to his filthy hovel. Each day she is forced by her new companion to beg on the streets. After several more months of dreadful hardship, Judith is taken in by a kindly young Christian woman, Miss Westmoreland. Slowly Judith begins to recover her mental and physical health and a strong bond of friendship forms between the two women. Through Judith, Miss Westmoreland learns of the appalling conditions in which London's poor live. She resolves to set up an orphanage and hospital to care for abandoned children. The two women raise the necessary funds and advertise for a doctor to run their new enterprise. One of the applicants is the now-qualified Dr. Robert Barnabas. Reunited at last, Barnabas and Judith are soon married. They return to Essex to live on the Mortimer farm. It transpires that the dispute over her great-grandfather's will has been settled in her favour and the farm is now hers. ==Characters in \\"Judith\\"== Judith Mortimer: A nineteen-year-old girl who struggles to keep her home from falling into the hands of her nefarious relatives. Jonathan Mortimer: Judith's ailing father who has neglected the family farm to pursue his scholarly writings. Robert Barnabas: A smuggler who loves Judith and who turns his back on his illegal trade to become a doctor. Francis Mortimer: Judith's cousin and childhood sweetheart. Evergreen: A poor orphan gypsy girl whom Judith takes under her wing. Mr. Massingham: An older man who lusts after Judith and who puts financial pressure on her to marry him. Miss Westmoreland: A young Christian woman who rescues Judith from the streets. ==Major themes== Judith is concerned with the difficulties faced by women in a hierarchical society dominated by men. Because the heroine makes it clear that she will not conform to society's rigid rules, those who enforce those rules try to break her spirit. Through Judith's experiences in late nineteenth-century London, the reader is confronted with the horrific reality faced by those who lack the privileges of position and money. The religious hypocrisy of the time is also exposed. Mr. Carteret, the local vicar, arrives at the Mortimer farm to take Evergreen to the workhouse. When Judith refuses to give her up, the vicar loses his temper. ==Literary significance & criticism== According to author and critic, Gina McDonald, \\"Cleeve brings to history and romance a social conscience and raises questions of social justice, national character, and personal responsibility.\\"Vasudevan, Aruna (ed.), Twentieth-century romance and historical writers, St. James Press, 1994, ==Release details== *1978, United Kingdom, Cassell, Hardback *1978, USA, Coward, McCann & Geoghegan, Hardback *1979, United Kingdom, Hodder & Stoughton Ltd., Paperback *1979, USA, Berkley Publishing Corporation, Paperback ==Sources, references, external links, quotations== Category:1978 novels Category:Historical novels Category:Novels by Brian Cleeve Category:Novels set in Essex Category:Fiction set in 1799 Category:Cassell (publisher) books ","title":"Judith (novel)"},{"id":"9113162","text":"Montgomery Castle () is a stone masonry castle looking over the town of Montgomery in Powys, Mid Wales. It is one of many Norman castles on the border between Wales and England. == Motte and bailey castle == The original motte and bailey is now known as Hen Domen and was built at the order of Roger de Montgomery, Earl of Shrewsbury, sometime between 1071 and 1074. On the rebellion of his son Robert of Belleme in 1102, the castle was given to Baldwin de Boulers. It is from Baldwin that Montgomery gets its Welsh name, Trefaldwyn (Baldwin's town). The de Boulers (later known as Bowdler) family held the castle until 1215, when the fortress was destroyed by Prince Llywelyn ab Iorwerth. The motte and bailey was subsequently refortified as an outpost for the new stone castle and probably survived until around 1300. == Stone castle == The ruined gatehouse to the inner ward seen from the south The rebuilding of Montgomery Castle in stone was commenced in the late summer of 1223 on the 16th birthday of Henry III of England, a mile to the south-east of the original site. The architect of the new castle was Hubert de Burgh, who also rebuilt Skenfrith Castle, Grosmont Castle and White Castle in the Welsh Marches. From 1223 until 1228 masons worked solidly building the entire inner ward, or donjon as it was then known, on a great rock above the later town of Montgomery. This work consisted of the gatehouse, two D-shaped towers and the apartments which crowded around the curtain wall of the inner ward. After an unsuccessful attack by Prince Llywelyn ab Iorwerth in 1228, the middle and outer wards were added to the castle. The castle was again attacked in 1233, which resulted in damage to the well tower, which had to be subsequently repaired and re-roofed. Montgomery was granted a Royal Charter by the king in 1227, making it the oldest borough in Wales. In 1267 Montgomery was the meeting place for treaty negotiations, where King Henry III granted Llywelyn ap Gruffudd the title of Prince of Wales. Fifteen years later, in December 1282, the army of Montgomery marched from here to Builth Wells to surprise and kill Llywelyn. After 1295 and the final Welsh War of the thirteenth century, the castle became more of a military backwater and prison than a front-line fortress. == Owain Glynd≈µr == The walled town of Montgomery was attacked by the Welsh forces of Owain Glynd≈µr in 1402 and sacked and burned. However, the stone castle fortress held out against the attack. Though the garrison was not large, the design and the men inside did their job. The town walls were not rebuilt, and the town remained a ruin for two whole centuries. The town walls have now all but disappeared over the intervening centuries, but the town ditch remains. == English Civil War == In September 1644 the 1st Baron Herbert of Chirbury surrendered the castle to Parliamentary troops in the Civil War. It was later demolished by order of the Parliament in June 1649 who had referred the matter to the Council of State, despite the plea against demolition by Richard Herbert, the succeeding eldest son of the late Lord Herbert of Cherbury who had died the previous year. The 2nd Baron, the last Herbert to have lived at Montgomery Castle, was buried at Montgomery in 1655.W. R.

For a time, the elementary program was located in the same building as the high school. Kindergarten to 6th grades were located on the 3rd floor of the north building. The school board then expanded to buy two more buildings at different locations but still in the downtown Ogden area. These buildings are located at 215 22nd Street and 2221 Grant Ave. The building on 22nd Street is now the home of the DaVinci Academy Elementary School, hosting grades K‚Äì6 in on-site instruction. The 2221 Grant Avenue building is the headquarters of the distance elementary program, where students come on campus intermittently between taking online courses from home. The distance elementary program has also expanded to two more locations: one in South Jordan, Utah and the other in Kaysville, Utah. The original buildings at 2033 Grant Avenue are still the campus of the DaVinci Academy secondary school. After the establishment of DaVinci Academy Elementary in its own structure, the entirety of the building is dedicated to the secondary program, including 7th to 12th grades. Currently, the south building is used for the main office, computer labs and cafeteria. The first floor of the north building is used for the counseling and behavior offices, gymnasium, school store, board room and theater. The second and third floors are mostly used for classroom space but also include the Library, robotics lab and a few administrator offices. ==Premise== The founding premise of the school was a project-based learning environment focusing on science and the arts. DaVinci Academy's graduation requirements require more course credits in all academic areas and the arts than does Utah's public school system. ==Awards and Recognition== n 2008, DaVinci received recognition from the Utah Association of Public Charter Schools as its Utah State Charter School of the Year at its annual conference. DaVinci Academy students often participate in, and receive awards for, State and National Competitions. A few of the awards won by students includes Envirothon, Academic Decathlon, Academic Pentathlon, Team America Rocketry Challenge, Idaho State One Act, Sterling Scholar, and VEX Robotics. Students are encouraged to participate in these competitions and showcases as a part of their Science and Arts education. ==Athletics== There are several sports played by the High School students at the school. Basketball, Bowling, Cross Country Running, Association Football (commonly called Soccer), and Volleyball are the sports in which students participate. DaVinci Academy competes in the Utah School Sports Association with other charter and private schools in the Wasatch Front region of Utah. The Athletic Program has had success on many fronts, winning conference titles in Bowling, Cross Country, Soccer and Volleyball. ==External links== * DaVinci Academy * DaVinci's Notebook ==References== Category:Charter schools in Utah Category:Educational institutions established in 2004 Category:Public elementary schools in Utah Category:Public high schools in Utah Category:Public middle schools in Utah Category:Schools in Weber County, Utah Category:Schools in Utah ","title":"DaVinci Academy of Science and the Arts"},{"id":"9113258","text":"Coming Out is the third album by The Manhattan Transfer, released August 19, 1976 on Atlantic Records.

Also: Asmund; Old Swedish: Asmu√∞√¶r; Latin: Osmundus, Aesmundus. Born at an unknown date c. 1000, probably in England; educated at the schools of Bremen (shortly?) after 1014 (when his sponsor first became a 'bishop of the Norwegians'); served as court-bishop to King Emund the Old of Sweden (who reigned as sole king c. 1050 ‚Äì c. 1060); was expelled from Sweden and travelled to England via Bremen probably in 1057; died as a monk of Ely in the abbacy of Thurstan (1066 - c.1072).Fairweather 2014, pp. 13-28. Osmund, missionary bishop in Sweden and monk of Ely, is not to be confused with Saint Osmund, Bishop of Salisbury (d. 1099) Osmund (Bishop of Salisbury). He is also to be distinguished from Amund (d. 1082), the successor of Saint David as Bishop of V√§ster√•sFairweather (2014) p. 22. and from the Bishop Osmund who, as a monk of F√©camp, signed a privilege in 1017.Fairweather (2014) p. 23. It is not entirely out of the question that the rune-carver Asmund Karesun, Asmund Karesson who produced Christian memorials in central Sweden in the 1020s and '30s, might have been the future Bishop Osmund, but this hypothesis has not won much favour in recent years. ==CareerSwedish bishopric and expulsion=== Bishop Osmund is best known from the hostile report on an incident in his career which Adam of Bremen derived from a memorandum on recent Swedish affairs written by Archbishop Adalbert of Hamburg-Bremen on the basis of information received from Adalward, formerly Dean of Bremen and later, Bishop of Skara.Adam of Bremen book 3, chapters 15-16 In essence, what this report tells us is that Osmund was a prot√©g√© of a bishop of the Norwegians called Sigafridus, who had sponsored his education at Bremen. By the time, in the mid-1050s, when the former Dean Adalward, along with a retinue from Bremen, travelled to Sweden with a view to his acceptance as Bishop of Skara, Osmund was serving as King Emund's court bishop and behaving as if he were the kingdom's archbishop. There ensued a clash, apparently at a public assembly, in which Osmund successfully rejected Adalward's bid to replace him in his position of primacy over the Christians of Sweden. Adalward could only supply evidence of accreditation by the Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen, whereas Osmund claimed that his own authority came from the papacy, and presumably was able to produce convincing documentation to that effect, though it emerged from examination of the evidence that he had not actually received ordination at Rome, but from 'a certain archbishop of Poland'. The delegation from Bremen was obliged to return home, fulminating against Osmund in the defamatory terms which were in due course introduced to the public domain in the third book of Master Adam's history of his archdiocese. However, already at the time of the original public controversy, at least one person present expressed strong disapproval of Osmund, maintaining that he was a promulgator of 'unsound teaching of our faith' and Stenkil, King Emund's son-in-law and eventual successor, thought well enough of Adalward to offer him some assistance with his return journey. Furthermore, public opinion in Sweden was to prove very volatile: the death of King Emund's son and heir by poisoning during a military expedition, combined with a disastrous harvest and famine (probably in 1056-7),Trillmich 1961, p. 347, note 1056. proved sufficient to turn the mood of the nation against Osmund, so that he was in his turn expelled from Sweden and Adalward recalled. Bishop Osmund's first move, after expulsion, seems to have been to make peace with Archbishop Adalbert in Bremen. The archbishop adopted towards him his customary approach towards bishops 'consecrated elsewhere', keeping him in his company for a while in exchange for a promise of obedience, and then giving him a cordial send-off.Adam of Bremen 3, chapter 77 Evidently, Osmund next took ship to England, and what happened afterwards is recorded in a twelfth century chronicle, the Liber Eliensis.Liber Eliensis 2, chapter 99. ===Retirement to Ely=== He received a welcome from King Edward the Confessor and spent a considerable period at court before deciding to enter the Abbey of Ely as a monk. There, he was received by Abbot Wulfric into the community on favourable terms which required him to exercise no office other than that of a bishop. He remained in the monastery until his death 'in the times of Abbot Thurstan', that is, between 1066 and c. 1072.Liber Eliensis 2, chapters 100-112. This abbacy was famously not a peaceful era for Ely. Soon after the Norman Conquest, the resistance-leader Hereward based his militia for a period in the monastery, which endured a protracted siege before the abbot, faced by the expected arrival of Danish reinforcements to the militia, made terms with the Conqueror.Fairweather 2014, pp. 323-6. How much of this time of trouble Osmund may have lived through is not recorded. Bishop Osmund was one of seven notable individuals from the pre-Conquest era considered by the Benedictine monks of Ely to be so worthy of commemoration as benefactors that their remains, originally entombed in the abbey-church dating from 970, were carefully exhumed for preservation in the Norman-era church which was built to replace it and in 1109 became Ely Cathedral. The remains of the so-called 'Seven Confessors of' Ely have been housed, since the late 18th century, when they were last exhumed, in caskets within a monument situated in Bishop West's Chapel, at the south-east corner of the Cathedral and Osmund is commemorated simply, in Latin, as 'a bishop from out of Sweden'.Keynes 2003 ==Preaching and character== What exactly Osmund may have preached that could have been considered 'unsound teaching' of the Christian faith has been much discussed, but it is not a question that can be answered with any certainty today. See Schmid 1934, pp. 61-6, Arne 1947, Janse 1958, Gustafsson 1959, Beckman 1970, Hallencreutz 1984, Janson 1998, Niblaeus 2010, pp 112-3 with note 298, Garipzanov 2012, pp. 2-3, Fairweather 2014, pp. 26-27; 158-172. Even Bishop- elect Adalward may not have been given any clear idea about what laid behind the charge, let alone Adam of Bremen. To both, it was hear-say, not something about which they could personally testify. Osmund's alleged departure from orthodoxy is not at all likely to have been connected with the Great Schism, the significance of which was as yet little understood in the northern Germanic regions of Europe.Adam of Bremen 3, chapter 72; Fairweather 2014, p. 161. The best clues to the character of the theological milieu in which Osmund operated, and for which he may have been thought responsible, are to be found in the not always very orthodox inscriptions and mythological carvings on memorial rune-stones set up in eleventh-century Sweden by members of the Christian laity.Fairweather 2014, pp. 165-71. As regards Osmund's character, background and standing as a missionary, it is not to be assumed that the characterization of him in Adam of Bremen 3, chapter 15, as an ungrateful, heretical vagabond and acephalous pseudo-archbishop, tells the whole truth about him. Happily, there is just enough evidence extant in medieval literary sources, not least in observations made by Adam of Bremen himself, to enable us to raise serious doubts about that verdict. The fact that Osmund's education was sponsored by 'Sigafridus, a bishop of the Norwegians' locates him, in an ancient and honourable tradition of missionaries dispatched from England, or under English leadership, to parts of continental Europe beyond the bounds of Christendom.See C.H. Talbot 1954 pp. vii-xvii. For Osmund's patron has to be identified as the Sigafridus listed as the third in a succession of bishops based in Trondheim and originating from England, a bishop known by Adam of Bremen to have worked in Sweden as well as Norway. It also seems overwhelmingly probable that he was the same man remembered in Swedish hagiography and local traditions as Saint Sigfrid 'from England'.See Fairweather 2014, pp. 176-213. Given his close connection, and possible family relationship, with a saint known as the 'Apostle of Sweden', and his later rise to the status of a bishop in that country, it seems a near-certainty that Osmund would have spent his early career, after education in Bremen and receiving of Holy Orders, working as a junior member of Saint Sigfrid's mission team, in readiness for the day when he might prove an eligible successor to his educational sponsor.Fairweather 2014, pp.218-236. Local traditions preserved in Halland, which associate the names of 'Saint Sigfrid' and 'Saint Asmund' with holy springs, may emanate from work done by the two missionaries together in that area, which, in the early eleventh century, up until King Emund's time, was territory disputed between Denmark and Sweden. See Fairweather 2014, pp. 85-6. Latin hagiographical sources assert that within the Swedish kingdom, Saint Sigfrid was granted land for the church at Husaby near Skara, and at Hoff and Tiurby in the vicinity of V√§xj√∂, and that he furthermore founded bishoprics for the two parts of G√∂taland, western and eastern, and also at Uppsala and Str√§ngn√§s. Scriptores Rerum Suecicarum Medii Aevi, vol II, part 1, pp. 344-370 This information, combined with the evidence of rune-stones datable to the earlier decades of the eleventh century, suggests the spread of 'English' missionary activity over southern and eastern-central Sweden, as far north as Uppland.see Carver 2003. It may be assumed that Osmund's work could have ranged over all these areas. The incident of his clash with Adalward happened at an assembly of the Sueones, so most probably at Uppsala.Fairweather 2014, p. 297. However, apart from Adam of Bremen's report of that incident, the only medieval literary records of Osmund's activity as a bishop in Sweden come from the bishop-lists of Skara and V√§xj√∂ and so refer to his work in the southern part of the kingdom. The V√§xj√∂ list simply names him as the successor of Sigfrid, who was, understandably, honoured of the founder of V√§xj√∂'s line of bishops. Scriptores Rerum Suecicarum Medii Aevi, vol. III, part 2: pp. 130-2. The Skara lists,Scriptores Rerum Suecicarum Medii Aevi, vol. III, part 2, pp. 112-115. late, confused and problematic authorities though they are, preserve some local historical traditions specifically about Osmund which have the ring of truth and may help to elucidate some problems raised by Adam of Bremen's account of the early years of the diocese of Skara. According to Adam's account,Adam of Bremen, book 2, chapters 58 & 64; book 2, chapters 15-16; book 4, chapter 23. this diocese was founded by Archbishop Unwan of Hamburg-Bremen in the principal city of G√∂taland, at the behest of King Olof Sk√∂tkonung. Thurgot was its first bishop, who, however, after an unspecified length of time, was recalled to Bremen where he took sick and eventually died. After Thurgot's death, Gottskalk, Abbot of Ramesloh nominally succeeded him, but never set foot in the Swedish kingdom. Only after Osmund's expulsion, when Adalward I took up residence in his see, did Skara acquire from Hamburg-Bremen a successor for Thurgot who actually became an effective missionary-bishop. Adam says nothing about how Skara coped with the virtual vacancy-in-see between Thurgot's recall and Adalward's enthronement, a period of more than a quarter-century. Only the late-medieval bishop-lists of Skara provide clues as to what happened there in the years immediately before the accession of Bishop Adalward I. Evidently deriving their data from local traditions quite distinct from Adam of Bremen, they make no mention of either Thurgot or Gottskalk. Instead, the message they convey is that at first it was Sigfrid 'from England' who served as bishop in the area (though his mission-base was evidently not in Skara itself)See Fairweather 2014, p. 210.; that Sigfrid's immediate successor was another Englishman, named Unno, who suffered a martyr's death by stoningFairweather 2014, pp. 210-13.; that he, in turn, was succeeded by Osmund, who won acceptance to the extent that he was actually enabled (presumably by the cathedral chapter and the local population) to 'sit' as bishop in Skara, and also provided with a residence at Mildu hede, on former common-land, adjacent to that of the dean, who had been there before his arrival; that he 'swore a solemn oath' and 'governed well as long as he could'. Fairweather 2014, pp. 283-6. Thus Osmund was remembered respectfully in Skara's late-medieval bishop-lists, even though they contain acknowledgement that the diocese was not in a state of 'proper obedience' until his Bremen-appointed successors put this matter right.See entry on Osmund's successor, Stenfin√∞aer; Fairweather 2014, pp. 286-7. Later entries in the same bishop-lists show that Osmund was by no means the last bishop with an 'English' background to hold sway at Skara. Considered from a modern perspective, the fact that Osmund had looked to the papacy for ordination as a bishop, rather than to Bremen, need not be considered a matter for surprise or consternation. Archbishop Adalbert's dreams of setting himself up as a northern patriarch were short-lived,Adam of Bremen, book 3, chapters 72-78 and with regard to the provision of effective episcopal leadership for Sweden his record was deplorable.Adam of Bremen, book 4, chapters 23 (with scholium 136); chapters 29-30. Among missionaries in the 'English' tradition,English translations of select texts in Talbot 1954. Bede's historical recording ensured preservation of the memory that St Augustine had been dispatched to England because of a papal initiativeBede, Historia Ecclesiastica Gentis Anglorum, book 1, chapters 23-33 & book 2, chapters 1-3.: for Willibord of UtrechtSee, e.g. Bede, Historia Ecclesiastica Gentis Anglorum, book 5, chapter 11. and Boniface of FuldaBoniface, Epistulae, for correspondence with Popes Gregory II and III, Zacharias and Stephen; also Willibald, Vita Bonifatii 5. alike, papal approval for their missions had seemed a matter of paramount importance, and we may be pretty sure that the same would have been true of Saint Sigfrid, although we happen not to have any evidence extant to prove it. Strong links between the prelates of the English church and the papal Curia were to be maintained all through the pre-Reformation period, despite their extreme geographical inconvenience. That Osmund, having ventured to make the journey from Sweden to Rome, was, according to Adam of Bremen's report, rebuffed on arrival at his destination, need not stand to his discredit, given the frequency with which successive popes replaced one another in second quarter of the eleventh century, all too often amidst scandal and faction- fighting Fairweather (2014) pp. 246-7. As for his subsequent obtaining of 'ordination' as bishop from 'a certain archbishop of Polania', it needs to be stated that 'Polania' definitely means 'Poland' and no other country.Fairweather (2014) pp. 249-50. Ever since the decree of Prince Mieszko I known as Dagome iudex, the Polish Church had committed itself to a particularly close relationship with RomeFairweather (2014) p. 253., and, to judge from that Church's earliest records, it seems highly unlikely that any mid-eleventh-century archbishop of Poland, whether Stephen of Gniezno or Aaron of Krak√≥w, would have consecrated a new bishop for Sweden, or anywhere else, without specific papal authorization.Fairweather (2014), pp. 278-9. The task confronting Osmund as virtual or actual primate of all Sweden was an extremely difficult one. King Emund, according to Adam of Bremen, 'cared little about our religion',Adam of Bremen, book 3, chapter 15. and it seems safe to infer from the available evidence that would have been obliged, as one of his kingly duties, to preside at the nine-yearly pagan festival held at Uppsala, at which human sacrifice was practised, along with the ritual slaughter of many animals.Adam of Bremen, book 4, chapters 26-30. Even in Skara or thereabouts, a very famous statue of the fertility god Fricco remained on display throughout Osmund's unofficial tenure of the bishopric, only to be destroyed at a somewhat later date.Adam of Bremen, book 4, chapter 9. Osmund, like all Christian missionaries operating in the Swedish kingdom, would have been obliged to respect the agreement made by Olof Sk√∂tkonung with the traditional polytheists of his country, 'not to force anyone of the populace to give up the worship of his gods, if he did not of his own accord wish to turn to Christ'.Adam of Bremen, book 2, chapter 58. It may well be that, in refusing a welcome to Adalward as Bremen's appointee to the see of Skara, Osmund was in breach of an oath of 'obedience' which he had sworn when enthroned there as Thurgot's de facto successor.Scriptores Rerum Suecicarum Medii Aevi, vol. 3, part 2, paragraphs 3 & 4; Fairweather (2014) pp. 283-7. His position at King Emund's court exposed him to the charge of being morally compromised. However, all in all, it may be doubted whether he was guilty of anything worse than pragmatic improvisation in a difficult mission-field and a breach of the letter of the law committed when he was suddenly faced with a crisis threatening the continuation of the labours of love to which he had felt called as the Swedish Kingdom's leading bishop. According to the bishop-lists of Skara, Osmund's successor in that diocese was one Stenfin√∞aer, identifiable with one Stenphi, who according to Adam of Bremen, had been appointed by Archbishop Adalbert to evangelize the Scrithefinni of far-northern Scandinavia. It appears that Stenfin√∞aer served temporarily as custodian of the diocese, and the restorer of its 'correct obedience', in the period between Osmund's expulsion and the return and enthronement of Bremen's official appointee, Bishop Adalward I. In the bishop-list of V√§xj√∂,Scriptores Rerum Suecicarum Medii Aevi, Vol. III.ii, pp. 130-2. the name of Osmund's immediate, or next but one, successor is given as Siwardus, the equivalent of OE Sigew√©ard. Further north in the Swedish Kingdom, the most notable successors of Sigfrid, and therefore also of Osmund, in the next generation, were Saint David of V√§ster√•sSee: Scriptores Rerum Suecicarum Medii Aevi, vol. 2, part 1, 405-410 for Historia Sancti Davidis Abbatis et Confessoris. and Saint Eskil,See: Scriptores Rerum Suecicarum, vol 2, part 1, pp. 389-95 for Legenda Sancti Eskilii. both originally from England. ==Bibliography== Abrams, Lesley (1995), 'The Anglo-Saxons and the Christianization of Scandinavia', Anglo-Saxon England 24, pp. 213-49.

Murray-Ramirez was first appointed by then-Mayor Dick Murphy, and reappointed by Mayor Jerry Sanders. When first elected four years ago, he was the first openly gay man elected as chair. Murray-Ramirez was unanimously elected chair by the fellow commissioners. Murray-Ramirez has served the last five mayors of San Diego, and was elected as the chair of the first mayor's GLBT Advisory Board and the first GLBT Advisory Board to the chief of police. Murray-Ramirez has been a Latino and gay activist for 45 years serving in roles as past national board member of the Human Rights Campaign, past National Chair of LLEGO, the National Chair of Stonewall 25, and the only gay activist in the country who has been elected to all four national boards of the Marches on Washington, DC.

The children were brought up by their mother, who moved to Weymouth in 1884 to open a school for young children including her own, and was successful enough to be appointed first headmistress of Weymouth College preparatory school in 1903. Davis attended Weymouth College from 1886 and went up to Balliol College, Oxford on a Brackenbury history scholarship, where he attained first classes in classical moderations in 1893 and literae humaniores in 1895 as well as the Jenkiyns exhibition. He was elected to a fellowship at All Souls College, Oxford, maintaining residence there from 1895 until 1902, and spending time teaching at University College, Bangor between 1896 and 1897. Davis won the Lothian Prize in 1897 and was appointed to a lectureship at New College, Oxford, and in 1899 exchanged lectureships and moved to Balliol, where on the expiration of his All Souls fellowship in November 1902 he was appointed a fellow of Balliol. In 1899 Davis published Balliol College, a work in the College Histories series, and in 1900, Charlemagne, in the Heroes of the Nations series, as well as articles in the English Historical Review in 1901. In 1903 he published the article The Anarchy of Stephen's Reign in the same journal, which presented the idea that the use of the term 'waste' in the Pipe Rolls indicated a much wider devastation resulting from the Anarchy than had been thought, fuelling the belief that a great anarchy occurred during Stephen's reign, although the 'waste' theory was later discredited. His first widely regarded book was England under the Normans and Angevins, published in 1905, it became a standard authority and reached a tenth print edition in 1930. It was, however, his only substantial contribution to narrative medieval history. In 1911 he wrote the summary Medieval Europe, in the Home University Library series, but from 1905 was more focused on editorial work, preparing an edition of Benjamin Jowett's translation of Aristotle's Politics, a revision of William Stubbs' Select Charters and starting the calendar of royal charters, Regesta regum Anglo-Normannorum. His academic presence inspired genuine respect and regard, and his lectures were well attended. Davis was junior dean of Balliol from 1906 until 1910, and an examiner in the final school of modern history between 1907 and 1909, and again from 1919 to 1921. In 1912 Davis married Jennie Rosa, the daughter of Walter Lindup, of Bampton Grange in Oxfordshire. In 1913 he took the Chichele lectureship in foreign history, and became a curator of the Bodleian Library in 1914. ==War years== The First World War drew Davis' attention away from academia, and he assisted in the production of a series of Oxford Pamphlets on the war and published a dispassionate analysis, The Political Thought of Heinrich von Treitschke. In early 1915 Davis moved to London and assisted the organization of the Trade Clearing House, a body sponsored by the Admiralty and Board of Trade to pool intelligence on commercial trade gathered from the postal censorship. When the Trade Clearing House grew and became the War Trade Intelligence Department and part of the Ministry of Blockade, under the Foreign Office, Davis became the vice-chairman. He later wrote of the department's workings in History of the Blockade, but left the work unfinished. On 7 October 1918 Jennie Rosa gave birth to Ralph Henry Carless Davis, who became a historian of the Middle Ages. In December 1918 at the conclusion of the war Davis served on the British delegation to the Paris Peace Conference until March 1919, and then spent a few weeks as the acting director of the Department of Overseas Trade at the invitation of Sir Arthur Steel-Maitland and in the New Years Honours of that year, Davis was made Commander of the Order of the British Empire. ==Return to Oxford== In April 1919 Davis returned to Oxford and resumed his usual college and university work. He took up the editorial directorship of the Dictionary of National Biography, for which the previous editor, Sir Sidney Lee, had conveyed responsibility to the University of Oxford in 1917. The names for inclusion in the dictionary and list of contributors were chosen by Davis and his co-editor J.R.H. Weaver, in consultation with a committee from Oxford and outside advisors. The volume of which Davis was in charge was published in 1927, and covered 1911 to the end of 1921. Davis accepted the chair of modern history at Manchester University in 1921, and he moved to Bowdon, spending three and a half years in the post. Davis was elected Ford's lecturer at Oxford for 1924-25; his posthumously printed The Age of Grey and Peel was his chosen subject material. During Hilary term 1925, Davis was appointed to succeed Sir Charles Firth as Regius Professor of Modern History, making him a fellow of Oriel College. Before the end of the year, Davis was elected an honorary fellow of Balliol and a fellow of the British Academy. In addition to his duties in Oxford, Davis took up a post on the unemployment insurance committee under fellow Balliol man Robert Younger, Baron Blanesburgh, and in 1927 he went to Geneva as British representative on a committee set up by the International Labour Organization to investigate and report on factory legislation in Europe.

Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania the son of Irish immigrants, John McShain graduated from St. Joseph's Preparatory School in 1918 after having attended La Salle College High School for several years. He later graduated from La Salle University, earning a bachelor's degree. ==Career== His father founded a successful construction company, which he was forced to take over at age twenty-one, when his father died in 1919. Under his management, the company became one of the leading builders in the United States. From the 1930s to the 1960s, McShain's company worked on more than one hundred buildings in the Washington, D.C. area. Most notably, the company built or was the prime contractor for a number of landmark structures including The Pentagon, the Jefferson Memorial, the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, the Library of Congress annex, Washington National Airport, and the 1949‚Äì52 reconstruction of the White House. Of his many construction projects, McShain also built the Franklin D. Roosevelt Library at Hyde Park, New York. His career as a building contractor garnered McShain significant wealth. He started the John McShain Charities as his philanthropy arm. McShain acquired the Barclay Hotel on Philadelphia's Rittenhouse Square and became part owner of the \\"Skyscraper By The Sea\\", the 400-room Claridge Hotel in Atlantic City, New Jersey. ==Thoroughbred racing== In 1952 John McShain established Barclay Stable in the United States and in 1955 expanded its operations to Ireland. Based in New Jersey, his racing stable met with reasonable success at New York State tracks and Monmouth Park in New Jersey, notably with Turbo Jet II. However, his greatest racing success came in Europe where in 1958 he was the British flat racing Champion Owner. McShain's colt Ballymoss won numerous prestigious races including Ireland's Irish Derby Stakes, England's St. Leger Stakes and France's Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. Ballymoss was voted 1958 European Horse of the Year honors and in 1981 the Republic of Ireland honored him with his image on a postage stamp. McShain also owned the filly Gladness who had victories in the Goodwood Cup and the Ascot Gold Cup. ==Philanthropy== A devout Roman Catholic, John McShain was a major benefactor to Wheeling Jesuit University. In 2000, the newly constructed admissions center was dedicated to the memory of him and his wife. McShain served on the Board of Directors of a number of major American corporations and educational institutions including St. Joseph's University, Catholic University, and Georgetown University. John also attended St. Joseph's Preparatory School, an urban Jesuit high school in North Philadelphia. McShain was also a benefactor to his alma mater, La Salle University, in which he helped plan the construction of La Salle's original academic building, College Hall. McShain Hall was named after him. La Salle University also has a student award named after McShain, given out yearly. The John McShain Award is offered to a member of the senior class who maintained an excellent scholastic record and is considered by faculty and staff to have done the most for the public welfare of La Salle.http://www.lasalle.edu/students/dean/awards/student/mcshain.htm Through the John McShain Charities, Sister Pauline McShain continued her parents' tradition of financial support for various Catholic organizations such as the Neumann College scholarship program. ==Personal life== In 1927 John McShain married Mary J. Horstmann (1907‚Äì1998). Over the years, the McShains began visiting Ireland and in 1956 acquired Kenmare House together with in Killarney (County Kerry). He and his wife extensively renovated the building and renamed it \\"Killarney House\\". In 1973, they gave Innisfallen Island and the ruins of its historic abbey to the government of Ireland. Five years later, Mr. McShain sold Killarney House and the greater part of the estate to the Irish State for a price well below market value at the time, having been assured that the house and estate would be incorporated into Killarney National Park. Mr. and Mrs. McShain reserved the house and surrounding 52 acres to their use for their lifetime. Mr. McShain died in 1989 and Mrs. McShain lived in the house until her death in 1998, when the house and surrounding land reverted to the Irish State. They are buried together in Philadelphia and commemorated with medallions at the Cathedral-Basilica of Sts. Peter and Paul. Their only child, Pauline McShain, became a Roman Catholic religious sister of the Society of the Holy Child Jesus. Having been empty for several years, the building fell into some disrepair.

In 1949, she started caring for the poorest of the poor in her convent's chicken yard in Salvador, Bahia. Today, more than 3,000 people arrive every day at this same site (where the Santo Ant√¥nio Hospital now stands) to receive free medical treatment. She also established CESA, a school for the poor in Sim√µes Filho, one of the most impoverished cities in the state of Bahia. At the time of her death in 1992, Sister Dulce had been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize,Four women to be canonized alongside John Henry NewmanDulce Lopes Pontes: From serving the sick to Nobel nominee she had received two personal audiences with Pope John Paul II, and she had, almost single-handedly, created one of the largest and most respected philanthropic organizations in Brazil. She was named the most admired woman in the history of Brazil by O Estado de S. Paulo newspaper and the most influential religious person in Brazil during the 20th century, by ISTO√â magazine. In 2011, she was beatified with papal approval by Cardinal Geraldo Majella Agnelo, the first step toward sainthood. In May 2019, Pope Francis, during an audience given to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints Prefect Giovanni Angelo Becciu, recognized the second miracle needed to officially canonize her as a saint. She was formally canonized on 13 October 2019,Dulce Lopes Pontes: From serving the sick to Nobel nominee, Vatican News (October 2019). making her the first Brazilian female saint.Angela Giuffrida, Victorian priest and scholar John Henry Newman to be made a saint in Rome, The Guardian (13 October 2019). == Early life == Born in Salvador, Bahia, the second daughter of Augusto Lopes Pontes and Dulce Maria de Souza, as Maria Rita de Souza Pontes, she entered religious life when she was 18 years old. When she was thirteen years old, her aunt had taken her on a trip to the poor area of the city. The sight of the misery and poverty she encountered there made a deep impression on the young girl, who came from an upper middle-class background. She began to care for the homeless and beggars in her neighborhood, giving them free haircuts and treating their wounds. By that time, she had already shown interest in following religious life. Her father, however, did not like the idea and insisted that she become a teacher . == Graduation and religious life == She graduated from high school at the age of 18. She, then, asked her father to allow her to follow her religious calling. He agreed and she joined the Congregation of the Missionary Sisters of the Immaculate Conception of the Mother of God, in Our Lady of Carmel Convent, in Sergipe. A year later, she received the religious habit of that Congregation and was given the name Dulce, in memory of her mother (who had died when she was 6 years old). == Social works == During the same year, she founded the \\"S√£o Francisco's Worker's Union\\", the first Christian worker's movement in Bahia. A year later, she started welfare work in the poor communities of Alagados and Itapagipe. It was then that they started calling her the \\"Angel of Alagados\\". In 1937, she transformed the Worker's Union into the Worker's Center of Bahia. Determined to house sick people who came to her for help, in 1939 Sister Dulce started to shelter them in abandoned houses in Salvador's 'Ilha dos Ratos' (rats' island) district. Then she would go in search of food, medicine and medical care. Later, when she and her patients were evicted from the neighborhood, she started housing them in an old fish market, but City Hall denied her the use of the space and told her to leave. Facing a big problem and already taking care of over 70 people, she turned to the Mother Superior of her convent and asked her permission to use the convent's chicken yard as an improvised hostel. The Superior reluctantly agreed, so long as Sister Dulce could take care of the chickens (which she did, by feeding them to her patients). That improvised hostel gave rise to the Hospital Santo Antonio, the center of a medical, social and educational complex which continues to open doors for the poor in Bahia and throughout Brazil. == The foundation of OSID == There, in 1960, the Santo Ant√¥nio Hospital, consisting of 150 beds, was inaugurated. On 26 May 1959 the Charitable Works Foundation of Sister Dulce was born, a result of the determination of a religious sister who was tireless in her attendance to the sick and to the beggars who lived on Salvador's streets. Sister Dulce's work impressed the President of Brazil, Jos√© Sarney, who in 1988 nominated her for the Nobel Peace Prize, with support of Queen Silvia of Sweden. The organization she founded, known by its Portuguese acronym as OSID (Obras Sociais Irm√£ Dulce), is one of the most well-known and respected philanthropic organizations in Brazil. == OSID == The Charitable Works Foundation of Sister Dulce is a private charity chartered under Brazilian law. It is accredited at federal, state and municipal levels and registered by the National Welfare Council and the Federal Ministry of Education. OSID provides health, welfare and education services, with a strong commitment to medical education and research. The Santo Ant√¥nio Hospital is the largest completely free hospital in Brazil, according to the Federal Ministry of Health. It has over 1,000 beds and receives more than 3,000 patients every day. OSID also established CESA (Santo Ant√¥nio Educational Center), a school for the poor in Sim√µes Filho, one of the most impoverished cities in the Metropolitan Area of Salvador and in the State of Bahia. There, OSID provides free educational programs for approximately 800 children and young people ranging in age from 6 to 19 years old. CESA offers basic education in accordance with the guidelines of the Brazilian Federal Ministry of Education. In addition, CESA has developed a complementary program of educational, physical and professional development activities to help students learn more effectively and enrich their lives. It also operates a commercial bakery and an orthopedic production center, staffed by professional workers, which produce and sell their products in many regions of Brazil and internationally, following the idea of self-sustainability which is part of the work concept created by Sister Dulce. == Health problems, death and burial == During the last 30 years of her life, Sister Dulce's lungs were highly impaired and she had only 30% breathing capacity. In 1990, her respiratory problems began to worsen and she was hospitalized. It was in her sick bed that she received the visit of Pope John Paul II (whom she had met, for the first time, in 1980). After being hospitalized for 16 months, Sister Dulce died on 13 March 1992, at the age of 77, in Santo Ant√¥nio's Convent, and she was buried at the Basilica of Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception. On 26 May 2000, her body was transferred to the Chapel of Santo Ant√¥nio Convent. On 9 June 2010, Sister Dulce was finally buried at the Imaculada Concei√ß√£o da Madre de Deus church, in Salvador, Bahia. It was discovered that her body was naturally incorrupt and even her clothes were still preserved 18 years after her death. ==Canonization== Sister Dulce received the title Servant of God under Pope John Paul II with the beginning of the cause for her beatification in January 2000 under the Archbishop of Salvador da Bahia and Primate of Brazil, Geraldo Majella Agnelo. who examined her virtues, fame of sainthood and the tireless determination of a life dedicated to the needy. In June 2001 the process continued in the Congregation for the Causes of the Saints. In June 2003 the Congregation received the positio. At that same time, the Vatican formally recognized a miracle performed by the intercession of Sister Dulce. On 10 May 2007, in a meeting with Pope Benedict XVI during his visit to Brazil, the Governor of S√£o Paulo and former Presidential candidate Jos√© Serra said he would send a letter to the Vatican in favor of Sister Dulce's beatification. On 20 January 2009, the Congregation for the Causes of Saints unanimously recommended to Pope Benedict XVI that he proclaim Sister Dulce's heroic virtue. Pope Benedict XVI approved and on 3 April 2009 granted her the title Venerable. Sister Dulce's body was exhumed and examined on 9 July 2010 as part of the beatification process, and was found to be still incorrupt. On 27 October 2010, the Archbishop of Salvador announced that the Congregation for the Causes of Saints had recognized a miracle attributed to her intersession, paving the way for her to be beatified. The pope officially approved on 10 December 2010. Sister Dulce was beatified in a Mass on 22 May 2011, in Salvador, Bahia. The Mass was presided over by the Archbishop of Salvador and the Primate of Brazil, Cardinal Geraldo Majella Agnelo, who conducted the beatification by mandate of Pope Benedict XVI; the service was attended by about 70,000 people.

Set in an Italian castle owned by the mysterious Diablo, all they must do to win the contest is be the first to find the check. Also hunting for the money are several others that are highly competitive and willing to do anything to win. The contest is to be recorded for a MTV-esque music channel and sponsored by the recording company of pop star Cassandra Castle, who is to accompany the contestants throughout the hunt along with VJ Rex. Cassandra, however, is unwilling to spend any time with the contestants and prefers to spend all of her time drinking excessively in her private room. Upon a whim Cassandra makes a deal with Rex to hide the money on her person so none of the contestants can find it. Upon the end of the competition the two will split the winnings. Once the contest begins the contestants begin a frantic search for the check, unaware of Cassandra's duplicity or that supernatural forces are picking the players off one by one. Cassandra's plans are waylaid when the forces begin to torment her and cause her to lose the check, which is carried throughout the castle on a magical breeze. Eventually only Jackie, Cassandra, and Tom are left, upon which point they are unable to ignore that something is very wrong. As Jackie frantically searches for answers she discovers a room at the top of the castle containing a crystal ball and Diablo, who reveals himself to be a demon. He also tells her that he has captured the souls of the other contestants in the sphere and will take them all to Hell, as well as that his next victim will be her brother. Meanwhile Cassandra and Tom have romantically connected with one another. He also discovers the check, which has landed near him and Cassandra. Tom is shocked when Cassandra chooses to burn the check and warns him that the money comes with strings attached that he wouldn't want. She throws the check into a fireplace, only Diablo to magically summon her to his room and chastise her for ruining his plans, revealing that Cassandra had formed a contract with him and that he will be taking her soul to Hell as well. In exchange for her soul she gained fame and wealth, which she quickly realized was not worth the bargain and took to alcohol and drugs to numb herself to her reality. In order to save both Tom and Cassandra Jackie tries to bargain with Diablo, offering her soul in exchange for the both of them. Horrified, Cassandra chooses to destroy Diablo's crystal ball, which puts an end to his evil plans and brings all of the contestants back to life. This also frees Cassandra, who reveals that she convinced Diablo to give her back her soul and to instead VJ at the music channel. The film closes with Diablo hosting a music broadcast and announcing a new contest that will bring him all new victims. ==Cast== * Gail O'Grady as Jackie * Bunty Bailey as Cassandra Castle * Harold Pruett as Tom * Adam Ant as Diablo * Richard Blade as Rex * Kim Johnston Ulrich as Teri * Michael Zorek as Harlan * Martha Demson as Myrna * Dale Wyatt as Jamie * Traci Lind as Yvette (as Traci Lin) (as Traci Linn) * William Butler as Billy * Michael Deak as Andy * Donald Hodson as Bruno * Marcello Modugno as Tony * Albert Band as The Cook ==Production== The film began shooting during July 1986 near Rome, Italy.

A pioneer Lutheran minister, he played a significant role in the development of the spiritual and intellectual development of Norwegians in America. Ulrik Vilhelm Koren has been called the \\"patriarch of Norwegian American Lutherans.\\" Ulrik Vilhelm Koren, 1826-1910(CyberHymnal 2008) ==Biography== Ulrik Vilhelm Koren was born in Bergen, Norway. Although the family home was at Bergen, but the family also spent much time at Selja, at the home of Koren's paternal uncle, Laurentius Koren. Selja, which was formerly known as Sel√∏, is a small island in the county of Sogn og Fjordane, Norway. Koren lived there after the death of his father, Paul S. S. Koren, a sea captain, in an earthquake in Haiti in 1842. Koren was an 1852 theology graduate from the Royal Frederick University.Ulrik Vilhelm Koren (Christian Cyclopedia. The Lutheran Church--Missouri Synod) Koren was called to the United States to serve the Little Iowa Congregation (later called Washington Prairie) in Winneshiek County, Iowa. He was the first Lutheran minister from Norway to settle west of the Mississippi. Koren's pastorate included large parts of Northeastern Iowa and Southern Minnesota. Many of the Lutheran congregations within that area look to Pastor Koren as their founder. Koren played an active part in the Synod of the Norwegian Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. Koren served as vice president of the Synod of the Norwegian Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (1871-1876) and was president of the Synod's Iowa District (1876- 1894). He was president of the synod from 1894 until his death in 1910.Ulrik Vilhelm (The Promise of America ‚Äì Norwegian National Library. Oslo)History Of The Norwegian Community Chickasaw County Iowa(Mr. James H. Johnson. Norwegian Heritage of Chickasaw County, Iowa) During his ministry, Koren wrote numerous publications addressing various issues of concern to the Lutheran religious community. His leadership ensured that Luther College moved to Decorah, Iowa in 1862 after an initial year in Wisconsin. Koren was also instrumental in purchasing the land and locating Luther College. In 1903, he was awarded a Doctor of Divinity degree from Concordia Theological Seminary. He was made a Commander of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav by the King of Norway. Rev. Koren died on December 19, 1910 and was buried in the cemetery of Washington Prairie Lutheran Church, Decorah, Iowa.Who's Who in the Luther College Archives (Luther College) ==Else Elisabeth Koren== In 1853 Koren married Else Elisabeth Hysing. Else's father, Ahlert Hysing, had been rector of the Latin School at Larvik which Koren had attended. Elisabeth was born on May 24, 1832 in Larvik. Vilhelm Koren knew half a dozen languages, and Elisabeth read Danish, Norwegian, German, and English. She was the author of The Diary of Elisabeth Koren, 1853-1855. The autobiography was translated into English and published in 1955. It provides detailed insight into what it was like for four adults and two children to spend the winter in a one-room 14-by-16-foot log house. In time, the Korens had nine children. Elisabeth Koren died on June 7, 1918 at Washington Prairie, in Winneshiek County, Iowa.Washington Prairie Lutheran Cemetery - Winneshiek County, Iowafrom Little Iowa Parsonage (Caroline Mathilde Koren Naeseth.

About 1,350 of these are vascular plants; about 335 are bryophytes; and about 2,000 are algae. Lichens are represented by about 500 species, and fungi by about 6,400 species. About 550 of these species are considered extinct or threatened. Protected areas now cover more than 12% of the territory of Lithuania. Lithuania lies both in the boreal and the broadleaved (angiosperm) forest belts. A variety of species are therefore found within its relatively small territory, including species characteristic of the southern taiga. The occurrence of the hornbeam species Carpinus betulus marks the border between the predominantly broadleaved zone in the south and the coniferous zone in the north. ==BiomesForests=== Forest cover in Lithuania has waxed and waned along with its fortunes; as a general rule, times of prosperity led to deforestation for agricultural uses. This tendency was seen during the Soviet occupation; forest cover was about 20% in 1948, and increased to about 30% by 1990, when Lithuania regained its independence. It has since been relatively stable. The general consensus of scientific opinion is that the optimum forest cover for Lithuania is about 33%. Conifers constitute about 60% of the total forest area. They are concentrated in the northern, western, and eastern, and far southern sections of the country. The principal conifers are Scots Pine at about 40%, and Norway Spruce at about 20%. Broadleaf trees dominate in the central areas of the country. Birches constitute about 18% of the total, followed by Black Alder (about 8%) and European Aspen (about 8%); oak, ash, and elm make up the remainder. Old growth forests are relatively rare in Lithuania, numbering about 100. Data collected in 1998 suggested that these forests occupied about 580 km¬≤. ===Wetlands=== About 5% of Lithuania is covered by wetlands; a number of these are classified as peat bogs, with about 6,700 distinct areas. Characteristic species of the peat bogs include Scheuchzeria palustris, Eriophorum (cotton-grass), sundew, cloudberry, cranberry species, and Andromeda polifolia (bog-rosemary). The peat bogs are sometimes subject to forest fires in the summer; about 280 such fires were noted between 1994 and 1999. ===Riparian and lacustrine=== Riparian and lacustrine (aquatic) flora present in Lithuania include duckweed, horsetails, bullrushes, sedges, and grasses. ==Crops== The principal crop plants in Lithuania are rye, wheat, oats, barley, peas, potatoes, sugar beet, and flax. About 46% of the country is covered by cropland. In addition to these major crops, various mushroom species are harvested; several species of berries are harvested, sometimes from the wild; and Common Hawthorn, Thyme, and Hypericum are important medicinal species. ==Common weeds and invasive species== Crop weeds in Lithuania include Hordeum vulgare (spring barley), Capsella bursa- pastoris, Chenopodium album, Papaver rhoeas, Sinapis arvensis, Spergula arvensis, and Viola arvensis. Galinsoga parviflora is one of the most troubling invasive species. ==Botanical research institutions== * Institute of Botany * Lithuanian Institute of Horticulture * Lithuanian Institute of Agriculture * Lithuanian Forest Research Institute ==References== *European Plant Data Sheets *Institute of Botany in Vilnius *Lithuanian law concerning plant protection - 1995 *Biodiversity of Lithuania *Trade in medicinal and aromatic plants in Lithuania *Lithuanian agriculture ","title":"Flora of Lithuania"},{"id":"9113707","text":"Henry Osborne (August 21, 1751 ‚Äì November 9, 1800) was a public official from Pennsylvania and Georgia. ==Biography== Born in Ireland, he emigrated to Pennsylvania in 1779, where he became a lawyer.

Ostankino Tower is visible above rooftops. Zverev Bridge. Ducks enjoy a warm spot (temperature is -9C) Zverev Bridge () is a pedestrian arch bridge that spans Vodootvodny Canal in Zamoskvorechye district of downtown Moscow, Russia. It was built in 1930 by N.Ya.Kalmykov (structural engineering) and I.A.Frantsuz (architectural design). ==History and specifications== The oldest pedestrian bridge in Moscow, it connects Sadovnichesky (formerly Zverev) lane with Bolshoy Tatarsky Lane. The name Zverev belonged to a local merchant family; in soviet time, it was deemed improper for a lane, but quite acceptable for a small bridge in a working-class neighborhood. Today, both sides of Vodootvodny Canal are a mix of expensive residential and office space, but in 1930 the Canal was flanked by industrial properties - textile mills in Sadovniki and Red Hills, boiler and turbine plants on the other bank. Main arch was made of in situ concrete, covered with jute mats for moisture protection and paved with ordinary asphalt. The unusually slim arch, traditionally painted white, is 32.675 meters long and 3.0 meters wide. In the middle, it is only 40 centimeters thick (55 centimeters including asphalt layer). Total length, including shoreside stairs, is 42.675 meters. Shallow but warm water in the Canal around this bridge attracts scores of mallard ducks in winter; in summer, it is abundant with small fish and yellow water lilies. ==Film location== The \\"Zverev Bridge\\" can be seen in the film \\"The Saint\\" (1997 with Val Kilmer and Emma Russel) at the time point of 01:06:20 ==See also== *List of bridges in Moscow ==References== *Russian: –ù–æ—Å–∞—Ä–µ–≤ –í.–ê., –°–∫—Ä—è–±–∏–Ω–∞, –¢.–ê., \\"–ú–æ—Å—Ç—ã –ú–æ—Å–∫–≤—ã\\", –ú, \\"–í–µ—á–µ\\", 2004, —Å—Ç—Ä.82 (Bridges of Moscow, 2004, p.82) Category:Bridges in Moscow Category:Pedestrian bridges in Russia Category:Arch bridges Category:Bridges completed in 1930 Category:Concrete bridges ","title":"Zverev Bridge"},{"id":"9113841","text":"Sanj or Senj (Persian ÿ≥ŸÜÿ¨) is a metallic percussion instrument, like a cymbal, but much larger in diameter, in the form of cup- or bell-shaped plates. Other names for Sanj, are Zang, Chalab, and BoshqƒÅbak. ==Etymology== All theories about the etymology of the word Sanj, identify it as a Pahlavi word. By some accounts means weight; and it is possible that the original term was Sanjk≈´b meaning ‚Äùstriking weights‚Äù [against each other]. By some accounts the word is reform version of \\"Zang\\" (bell), referring to its belle-shaped plate. ==History and Function== The instrument consists of cup- or bell-shaped round plates of various alloys, mainly brass or tin. The earliest record of its usage in Persian literature is of Ferdowsi‚Äôs masterpiece, Shahname. It referred to Sanj as a military-musical-instrument that was used by the legendary Iranian king, Q-mars. It was a favourite of King Key-Kavus and the Hero Rostam. About King Key Kavus: :Kavus received them graciously and taught them :New laws and ways. Anon the sound of bells :And cymbals rose with shouts and clarion-blare, :And he departed westward toward Mount Kaf. About Mazandaran, and what Rustam did: :His elephant-attendants' crowns of gold, :Their golden girdles and their golden torques, :Their golden Sanj (cymbals) and their golden Zang (bells), :Unmatched on earth, his jeweled parasol :Of peacocks' tails, these will we seize, and more, :When we are fighting with our lives at stake.\\" Hamzehnameh, which draws upon myth, literature and history, refers to Sanj as the instrument of Q-mars: \\"One morning, to sound the call for battle, Hamza ordered Alexander‚Äôs drum, Jamshed‚Äôs Sorna, and Gayomarth‚Äôs Sanj sounded. According to the Persian mythology, Q-mars (Gayomarth) is the first man created by Ahura Mazda, and the first King of the world.\\"The quotations in this paragraph are from Thackston (2002), trans. for cat. 33, p. 292, penultimate sentence for vol. 11, text number 6, and sections of vol. 11, text number 7. In other Persian literary works of Safavid era, Sanj was used as a lamentation instrument, especially during the Ashura. Sanj was used in the \\"Stone beating\\" symbolic rite, which still is popular in several parts of Iran. == Ashura ceremony == During the Ashura ceremony, normally two pieces of stone are beaten on the sides of the mourner with special movements accompanied by a lamentation song. Apparently as a result of the physical damage caused by stones on the body, wood sticks gradually replaced stone. Lately instead of stone beating other terms such as Karbzani or Karebzani, playing Sanj and ratchets are used. In Mazandaran and regions such as Qomesh, south of Alborz Mountain, the term Kareb and in Gilan the term Karb is customary. In Aran district of Kashan, sanj is used. This ceremony requires performers with considerable physical strength and is popular in Lahijan and Aran of Kashan, as well as Semnan and Sabzevar. ==References== Category:Persian musical instruments Category:Early musical instruments Category:Marching percussion Category:Iranian inventions ","title":"Sanj"},{"id":"9113845","text":"Henri Antoine de Ligne, Hereditary Prince of Ligne (Henri Antoine Gabri√´l Wauthier Marie Lamoral de Ligne; born 1 March 1989), is a Belgian aristocrat.

Hasell also had other experience in colonial affairs as judge of the Court of Oyer and Terminer (a court to hear and determine cases) for Craven, Carteret, Johnston, Beaufort, and Hyde counties. He lived at Belgrange on the lower Cape Fear. In 1766 Governor Tryon wrote the British Board of Trade that he had given the commission of chief justice to James Hasell and described him as \\"senior member of his Majesty's Council, next to the President. He is much the gentleman, has acted in this office at different times seven years to general satisfaction: has been always esteemed a steady friend to the measures of government....\\" ==Acting governor of North Carolina== After Governor Tryon left North Carolina to become governor of New York, the Council met on July 1, 1771, and Hasell took over office of the governor until the appointment of Josiah Martin, the last of the British governors. Governor Martin recommended that Hasell be made lieutenant governor in the place of Lieutenant Governor George Mercer, thinking that Mercer was to be appointed governor of Ohio. Though this appointment did not materialize, Mercer, remaining in England, nonetheless kept the office in the colony. During the course of this year, he also helped to found and establish the present-day Queens University of Charlotte (then known as the classical school Queens Museum). James Hasell (sometimes spelled Hassell) was onboard the HMS Cruizer on the Cape Fear River with Governor Josiah Martin as the Council met in its final meeting that called an end to the Province of North Carolina. The record of that meeting notes that Hasell said that the governor should \\"take every lawful measure in his power to suppress the 'unnatural rebellion' now fomenting\\". ==Personal life== Hasell was apparently a book collector. His \\"lost\\" library was discovered in the early part of the 20th century in one of the old houses on the Sound near Wilmington.

Acting in response to a parliamentary threat of disbandment, the document asserted that the army would not disband until satisfactory terms were negotiated. This was in part because of weeks of arrears owed to the soldiers, and in frustration of the slow progress parliament had made in securing a settlement with the imprisoned Charles I. ==Events== The agreement was read, and assented to by all the officers and soldiers of the regiments of the New Model Army that rendezvoused on Kentford Heath near Newmarket on Friday and Saturday 4 and 5 June. On 8 June Fairfax sent the Solemn Engagement to Parliament with a letter. In the letter he explained that because the King was now with the Army (Cornet Joyce having taken Charles I from Parliament's custody at Holdenby House), it had been agreed on 7 June that Charles would be held at Newmarket under the guard of two regiments of Ironsides. So that the Army and Parliament's commissioners could discuss the Engagement, without the King present, Fairfax moved the rendezvous with the commissioners to \\"Triploe Heath\\" at 9 o'clock in on Thursday 10 June, which was as soon as was practicable. At the Triploe Heath rendezvous the commissioners offers failed to pacify the New Model Army, largely because the officers and men were aware of the steps that Parliament and the City of London were taking against the Army, including an attempt to set up a rival army for which they were willing to pay while still withholding arrears of pay from the New Model Army.

The channel broadcasts regional event coverage of sports teams throughout the Midwestern United States, most prominently, professional sports teams based in St. Louis, Missouri. Fox Sports Midwest is available on cable providers throughout eastern and central Missouri, central and southern Illinois, Southern Indiana, Nebraska, and Iowa; it is also available nationwide on satellite via DirecTV and Dish Network. ==History== Fox Sports Midwest logo, used from 2008 to 2012. The channel originally launched in November 1989 as Prime Sports Midwest, serving as an affiliate of the Prime Network. Originally seen mainly within Indiana, the channel began expanding its cable provider coverage westward in 1994. Following Liberty Media's sale of the Prime Network to News Corporation, the channel became a member of the newly formed Fox Sports Net (then a joint venture between Liberty Media and News Corporation) and rebranded as Fox Sports Midwest on November 1, 1996. The channel was then rebranded as Fox Sports Net Midwest in 1999, as part of a collective brand modification of the FSN networks under the \\"Fox Sports Net\\" banner; subsequently in 2004, the channel shortened its name to FSN Midwest, through the networks' de-emphasis of the brand. In the spring of 2006, Fox Sports Midwest obtained the exclusive regional cable television rights to broadcast NBA games involving the Indiana Pacers. This resulted in the channel creating a spin-off regional sports network channel, Fox Sports Indiana, for the primary purpose of airing games from the Pacers and the WNBA's Indiana Fever; Fox Sports Indiana launched on November 1, 2006, at the start of the team's regular season. In the fall of 2007, Fox Sports Midwest signed an exclusive long-term agreement to broadcast games from the Kansas City Royals (this followed the team's decision to dissolve the Royals Sports Television Network, a regional television syndication service for the team's game broadcasts). On January 24, 2008, the network formally announced that it would spin-off its subfeed for the Kansas City market into a separate channel, Fox Sports Kansas City, to avoid scheduling conflicts with Fox Sports Midwest's St. Louis Cardinals game coverage. The main St. Louis-based feed reverted to the Fox Sports Midwest moniker that same year. On July 15, 2010, Fox Sports Midwest signed a new television contract with the St. Louis Cardinals, giving the channel exclusive regional broadcast rights to the team's games beginning with the 2011 season, ending the team's local broadcasts in the St. Louis market on NBC affiliate KSDK (channel 5). On July 30, 2015, Fox Sports Midwest and the St. Louis Cardinals agreed to a long-term television rights agreement. The new agreement began in 2018 and will run 15 seasons through the 2032 season. The deal will guarantee the St. Louis Cardinals more than $1 billion, including a 30% equity stake in the network. On December 14, 2017, as part of a merger between both companies, The Walt Disney Company announced plans to acquire all 22 regional Fox Sports networks from 21st Century Fox, including Fox Sports Midwest. However, on June 27, 2018, the Justice Department ordered their divestment under antitrust grounds, citing Disney's ownership of ESPN. On May 3, 2019, Sinclair Broadcast Group and Entertainment Studios (through their joint venture, Diamond Holdings) bought Fox Sports Networks from The Walt Disney Company for $10.6 billion. The deal closed on August 22, 2019. ==Programming== Fox Sports Midwest holds the exclusive regional cable television rights to Major League Baseball games from the St. Louis Cardinals and NHL games from the St. Louis Blues. As the St. Louis region is claimed by the NBA's Indiana Pacers, select games from Fox Sports Indiana are carried, mainly on Fox Sports Midwest Plus, or on the main channel if live Blues coverage is not airing. The channel also broadcasts college athletics, including men's basketball games from the Missouri Valley Conference, St. Louis Billikens and SIUE Cougars, as well as men's and women's basketball games from the Kansas State Wildcats (which are also broadcast on Fox Sports Kansas City). Until the creation of the SEC Network in 2014, it also screened a substantial amount of Missouri Tigers programming, including select football games, basketball, and occasional Olympic sports telecasts. It still airs weekly Mizzou magazine shows, as well as football and men's basketball coaches' shows. It also filled a similar role for the Nebraska Cornhuskers until they joined the Big Ten Conference (which too has its own TV channel) in 2012, and like for Mizzou it still airs university-produced ancillary programming for the Huskers. ==Other servicesFox Sports Midwest Plus=== Fox Sports Midwest Plus is an overflow feed of Fox Sports Midwest that was launched in October 2011. Fox Sports Kansas City and Fox Sports Indiana also operate their own Fox Sports Plus overflow feeds to resolve scheduling conflicts with Fox Sports Midwest-televised events that are simulcast on the two channels. ==Notable on-air staffCurrent=== St. Louis Blues * John Kelly ‚Äì play-by-play announcer * Darren Pang ‚Äì \\"Inside-the-Glass\\" reporter * Jim \\"The Cat\\" Hayes - Blues Live studio host * Scott Warmann - Blues Live studio host * Bernie Federko ‚Äì Blues Live studio analyst * Erica Weston - Blues live studio host and reporter St. Louis Cardinals * Dan McLaughlin ‚Äì play-by-play announcer * Rick Horton ‚Äì color analyst * Al Hrabosky ‚Äì color analyst * Tim McCarver ‚Äì color analyst * Jim Edmonds - color analyst * Brad Thompson - studio analyst * Rick Ankiel - studio analyst * Jim \\"The Cat\\" Hayes - field reporter * Scott Warmann - studio host * Erica Weston - field reporter and fill in studio host College sports * Eric Piatkowski ‚Äì Nebraska Cornhuskers men's basketball color analyst * Jon Sundvold ‚Äì Missouri Tigers men's basketball color analyst * Scott Highmark - Saint Louis Billikens men's basketball color analyst * Joe Pott - SIU Edwardsville Cougars men's basketball color analyst ===Former=== * Quinn Buckner ‚Äì Indiana Pacers analyst (now with Fox Sports Indiana) * Clark Kellogg ‚Äì Indiana Pacers analyst (now with Fox Sports Indiana) * Ryan Lefebvre ‚Äì Royals play-by-play (now with Fox Sports Kansas City) * Frank White ‚Äì Royals analyst (now with Fox Sports Kansas City) * Pat Parris - Blues Live Host, Cardinals Live Host, Saint Louis Billikens and SIUE Cougars men's basketball play-by-play (now with KGUN-TV)http://www.kgun9.com/about-us/staff/pat-parris ==References== ==External links== * Category:Television channels and stations established in 1989 Category:1989 establishments in the United States Category:Fox Sports Networks Category:Kansas City Royals broadcasters Category:St. Louis Cardinals broadcasters Category:St. Louis Blues broadcasters Category:Indiana Pacers broadcasters Category:Big 12 Conference broadcasters Category:Southeastern Conference broadcasters Category:Kansas State Wildcats basketball Category:Missouri Tigers basketball Category:Missouri Tigers football Category:Missouri Tigers softball Category:Missouri Tigers baseball Category:Prime Network Category:Television stations in St. Louis ","title":"Fox Sports Midwest"},{"id":"9113951","text":"\\"Dangerous Rendezvous\\" is the 22nd episode of Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons, a 1960s British Supermarionation television series created by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson and produced by their company Century 21 Productions. Written by Tony Barwick and directed by Brian Burgess, it was first broadcast on 9 February 1968 on ATV Midlands. In this sequel to \\"Crater 101\\", Spectrum uses the crystal taken from the Mysteron outpost on the Moon to contact the enemy and propose a truce between Earth and Mars. \\"Dangerous Rendezvous\\" is one of four Captain Scarlet episodes that were later re-edited and combined to create Revenge of the Mysterons from Mars (1981), a Captain Scarlet made-for- TV compilation film produced by the New York office of distributor ITC Entertainment. ==Plot== Following the destruction of the Mysteron outpost on the Moon, Dr Kurnitz of the Nash Institute of Technology has discovered that the crystal removed by Spectrum can be used to communicate with the Mysterons on Mars. Captain Scarlet (voiced by Francis Matthews) escorts Kurnitz to Cloudbase, where an interplanetary transmitter has been constructed. Meanwhile, the Mysterons threaten to destroy Cloudbase at midnight. Kurnitz activates the transmitter and Colonel White (voiced by Donald Gray) addresses the Mysterons. Recalling the Zero-X mission to Mars, White insists that the attack on the Mysteron city was motivated by fear, not hostility, and ends his broadcast with an offer of peace. Two hours later, the Mysterons respond: they agree to negotiate on the condition that a lone Spectrum officer, unarmed and without communications equipment, depart Cloudbase on a bearing that will take him over Greenland. Scarlet volunteers for the mission and leaves in a Spectrum Passenger Jet. After crossing the Greenland coast, Scarlet ejects on the orders of the disembodied Mysteron voice. He is picked up by a car under Mysteron control and driven to a shack containing a pulsating glass screen, behind which Captain Black (voiced by Donald Gray) is sitting. Instructing Scarlet to relay a \\"message\\" to humanity, Black starts a tape recording ‚Äì in which the Mysterons re-affirm their intention to destroy all life on Earth ‚Äì and departs. Scarlet smashes the screen to find a second Mysteron crystal, which begins to pulsate violently. He escapes the shack just before it is destroyed in an explosion. Realising that the first crystal is also a bomb, Scarlet takes the car and speeds to an unmanned radar station, where he transmits a warning to Cloudbase in Morse code. Seconds before midnight, White decodes Scarlet's message and orders Captain Ochre (voiced by Jeremy Wilkin) to shoot out one of the base's observation windows and jettison the crystal, which explodes harmlessly in the atmosphere. Later, White says that Spectrum remains committed to finding a peaceful solution to its war with the Mysterons. ==Production== The conclusion of a three-episode story arc that began with \\"Lunarville 7\\", \\"Dangerous Rendezvous\\" was actually filmed before the previous instalment, \\"Crater 101\\". It was shot back-to-back with \\"Traitor\\" on Century 21's Stage 3.Bentley 2017, p. 123. When Tony Barwick wrote \\"Dangerous Rendezvous\\" and \\"Traitor\\", filming on Captain Scarlet was several weeks behind schedule. To remedy this, Barwick included a flashback to the first episode, \\"The Mysterons\\", in each script to reduce the amount of new footage that would need to be filmed, enabling both episodes to be shot in 15 days instead of 20. Although the script for \\"Dangerous Rendezvous\\" allowed for approximately four minutes of recycled footage, the flashback in the finished episode ‚Äì in which Colonel White recalls humanity's disastrous first contact with the Mysterons ‚Äì runs for approximately two minutes.Bentley 2017, p. 151. Besides recounting the event that triggered Earth's war with the Mysterons, \\"Dangerous Rendezvous\\" was also written to explain a number of Spectrum protocols: the wait for the Mysteron reply is extended by scenes in which White, Captain Scarlet and Captain Blue, at Dr Kurnitz's request, give an overview of the organisation's communications (specifically its cap radio technology and call signs) and put on a demonstration Angel launch. \\"Dangerous Rendezvous\\" marks the return of Spectrum's security tanker \\"Yellow Fox\\", slightly modified from its first appearance in \\"Winged Assassin\\". Cloudbase is threatened with destruction for a second time in the series' penultimate episode, \\"Attack on Cloudbase\\". ==Reception== \\"Dangerous Rendezvous\\" is named the worst episode of Captain Scarlet by TV Zone magazine, which describes it as an anti-climactic \\"low-key effort\\" that \\"ends a trilogy of otherwise superb episodes on a let-down ... wasting two episodes' worth of superb build-up\\". Anthony Clark of sci-fi-online.com comments that while the pace of the episode \\"could hardly be described as breakneck\\", along with \\"Crater 101\\" and \\"Shadow of Fear\\" it helps to \\"progress Spectrum's fight back against the Mysterons\\". Chris Drake and Graeme Bassett suggest that the scenes of White, Scarlet and Blue explaining Spectrum's communications add interest to the episode. Chris Bentley argues that they are simply padding, comparing them to the expository Stingray and Thunderbirds mini-albums A Trip to Marineville and Introducing Thunderbirds. Drake and Bassett question White's logic in ordering a demonstration Angel launch while Cloudbase is under threat. Media historian Nicholas J. Cull suggests that the premise of \\"Dangerous Rendezvous\\" was inspired by contemporary events, arguing that the possibility of a truce between Earth and Mars echoes \\"shifting attitudes within the Cold War\\" during the 1960s. Comparing \\"Dangerous Rendezvous\\" to other episodes written by Tony Barwick, Cull observes that Barwick's scripts often \\"reflected a yearning for d√©tente and an alternative to the divided world.\\" The British Board of Film Classification certifies the episode U, noting that it contains one \\"very mild\\" instance of violence. ==References== Works cited * ==External links== * * * \\"Dangerous Rendezvous\\" at TheVervoid.com Category:1968 British television episodes Category:Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons episodes Category:Television episodes set in Greenland ","title":"Dangerous Rendezvous"},{"id":"9113954","text":"Hubbard House may refer to: *Hubbard House (Crescent City, Florida), historic building *Hubbard House (Jacksonville, Florida), domestic violence shelter *Hubbard House (Illinois), historic building in Hudson, Illinois *Hubbard House (Brooklyn, New York) ==See also== *Hubbard-Upson House, Sacramento, California, listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in Sacramento County, California *John Hubbard House, Lakeville, Connecticut, a contributing building in Lakeville Historic District *Coite-Hubbard House, Middletown, Connecticut, NRHP-listed *Nehemiah Hubbard House, Middletown, Connecticut, NRHP-listed *Joel H.

Sarah's shown to wear a red riding jacket with a matching red necktie and white pants in most episodes. She has been seen in younger ages and different hairstyles in flashbacks. She is voiced by Dana Donlan. Sarah's horse is Scarlet, a purebred black Shagya Arabian mare who has a long, black mane and tail with red highlights. Scarlet is fearless, level-headed, and regal, but at times can be moody and prefer to be left alone. She is patient and loving, much like her owner, and is great with kids. Her symbol is a red crown, representing royalty. She is voiced by Andrea Ware. ===Alma Rodriguez and Button=== Alma is 12 years old and comes from a tight-knit Hispanic family. Her father Jorge has worked as the manager of the stable at Horseland for ten years. An avid reader, Alma seems to take every opportunity to read. She's spirited and competitive, and is one of the best and most dedicated riders Horseland has to offer. She has a pen-pal named Alexander, who seems to have romantic feelings for her. Alma is shown to wear a green riding vest on top of a white long-sleeved shirt and beige pants in most episodes. She is voiced by Emily Hernandez. Alma's horse is Button, a black- and-white Pinto mare with a wavy mane and tail with green highlights. Button is teasing and amiable, loving to play jokes on her friends and owner. When it comes down to it, though, Button can be serious-minded, reliable, and very skilled in show jumping. Like Alma, she has a Hispanic accent. Her symbol is a green four-leaf-clover, representing luck. Her best friend is Calypso and Button is sometimes protective of Calypso. ===Molly Washington and Calypso=== Molly is a 12-year-old African-American girl who often deals with life's problems through humor. She is very funny, creative, and charismatic. She enjoys making fun of herself and, at times, her friends, which can cause them to get annoyed at the fact that she doesn't seem to take much seriously. However, Molly can become serious and ride a horse just as well as the others when her friends are counting on her. She is good at Western riding with Calypso and is the only one to consistently wear her hair in a ponytail. Molly is shown to wear a pink riding jumper and white pants. Her father is a dentist and she has a little sister named Lissa. She is voiced by Aleyah Smith. Molly's horse is Calypso, a chestnut blanket Appaloosa mare with a cream mane and tail with pink highlights. She is amiable, laid back, affectionate, and a little slow. When she learns something once, she's learned it for life. She loves her friends and rider dearly, and is particularly good friends with Button. She speaks with a Jamaican accent. Her symbol is a pink heart, representing love and she's best friends with Button. ===Chloe Stilton and Chili=== Chloe is 12 years old and the twin sister of Zoey. Chloe is the oldest twin and a confident, skilled young girl who likes to let other people know of her talents. She comes from a wealthy family and can often be conceited, self-centered, and shallow. However, like her sister, Chloe can also be very friendly and civil with the other girls. She has an unrequited crush on Bailey, and would go to great lengths to impress him. She is especially fond of clothes and makeup, and loves to look great when she rides. Though Chloe is competitive with her sister, Zoey, they still support each other when it's important. Chloe has strawberry-blonde hair and light green eyes. She is shown to wear a lavender jumper, a lavender headband and purple pants. She is voiced by Bianca Heyward, Caroline Iliff season 3 Chloe's horse is Chili, a light grey Dutch Warmblood stallion with lavender highlights in his mane and tail. Chili shares Chloe's confidence to the point that he feels he is the most talented horse at Horseland, though he often feels upstaged and unappreciated by his showy rider. He and Aztec disagree with each other frequently, but they don't let it ruin their friendship. Both Chili and his rider are talented in dressage. His symbol is a lavender diamond, representing discipline. ===Zoey Stilton and Pepper=== Zoey is 12 years old and the twin sister of Chloe. Zoey is the youngest twin and takes a more sneaky approach with her competitiveness, and is into fashion and makeup. She is talented in cross country, and is even captain of Horseland's cross-country team. She loves to show off and can be quite flirtatious with the boys that she meets. She is competitive with her sister Chloe, but they still support each other when it counts. And like her sister, Zoey can be shallow and rude, though she can also be considerate and nice. Zoey has wavy red hair, freckles and green eyes and is shown to wear a turquoise short-sleeved top and white pants. She is voiced by Caroline Iliff. Zoey's horse, Pepper, is a gorgeous dark grey purebred Dutch Warmblood mare with turquoise highlights in her wavy mane and tail. Pepper is quick-tempered and snappy, sporting a large ego and confidence to match. While she loves her rider and is good friends with Chili, she is usually on bad terms with the other horses, though as a herd they manage to still remain friends. Like Zoey, Pepper is snarky, spirited, and loves to compete. Her symbol is a turquoise crescent moon, representing grace. ===Bailey Handler and Aztec=== Bailey is the 13-year-old son of the Horseland owners. He often takes risks and gambles without considering the consequences of his actions, and enjoys joking around and having a good time. He loves horses and animals, and insists that they be treated with kindness and gentleness. Bailey has a dark brown mullet and dark blue eyes, and is considered the local heartthrob at the stables, much to his own embarrassment. Bailey's shown to wear a dark blue long sleeved shirt with the sleeves rolled up and lighter blue pants. He sometimes wears a cowboy hat. He is voiced by David Kalis. Bailey's horse is Aztec, a brown Kiger Mustang with dark blue highlights. He frequently acts grumpy and nonchalant, but he does genuinely care about his friends and the other animals. He is often protective of his mare friends, much to their irritation, and has shown great courage, determination, and leadership skills. His symbol is a dark blue lightning bolt, representing strength. ===Will Taggert and Jimber=== Will is 15 years old, relaxed, and good looking. Will is often put in charge of the ranch while Bailey's parents are away. He is Bailey's cousin and has lived with Bailey's family ever since he was a little boy. Mature and insightful, he often acts as an adult figure to the rest of the kids and also serves as their riding instructor and mentor. He loves to listen to country music and is great at horse riding, whether it be Western and English. He has blonde hair and gray- blue eyes. He's shown to wear a black short-sleeved shirt with a horseshoe pendant around his neck, and dark blue pants. In \\"The Secret\\", Will reveals that he has dyslexia, just like Sarah's cousin Chase. He always helps her when she's down and defends her when she is hurt. He is voiced by Vincent Michael. Will's horse is Jimber, a powerful Palomino stallion with black highlights in his mane. Similar to Will, he has a commanding presence among the others at Horseland, and worked as a ranch horse before coming to Horseland. He's a bit older in years in comparison to the other horses, but is dependable and wise. Jimber speaks with a Southern accent. His symbol is a black star, representing loyalty. ===Nani Cloud and Sunburst=== Nani is a 12-year-old Native American girl who appears in multiple episodes during season three. She is proud of her Cherokee heritage and loves nature and horses. Nani has black hair and hazel eyes, and is shown to wear light blue and light yellow. She is quick to defend herself and accidentally stirs up a rivalry between her and Zoey for the position of leadership for the cross-country team at Horseland. She is voiced by Rachel Ware. Nani's horse is Sunburst, a generally calm and polite palomino Paint gelding with yellow highlights. He cannot stand to wear saddles and prefers to be ridden bareback, though he gets used to saddles eventually. Like their owners, he at first starts out on bad terms with Pepper, but the two eventually become friends, and he later begins to show great concern for her well-being. Unlike many of the other horses, he rarely let's mean words affect him. He has a single braid under his mane. His symbol is a yellow sun with blue lights, representing dignity. ===Shep=== Shep is a wise male collie, who acts as the leader of the animals at Horseland, and is the narrator of the series. He is a very loyal ranch dog and always helps the horses in times of trouble. Shep often serves as the voice of reason for Teeny and Angora, and, to illustrate a moral or lesson, frequently relates stories to Teeny (most of the episodes are actually flashbacks to previous events). He is friendly, perceptive, and protective of both the horses and the riders at Horseland. His owner is Bailey. Shep has been with him since he was a pup. Shep would frequently break the fourth wall from time to time, addressing the audience about the episode's lesson. Shep is voiced by Jerry Longe. ===Teeny=== Teeny is a young, adorable, chubby black-and-white potbelly pig who wears a pink ribbon on her tail. She displays an innocent, naive personality, and often becomes anxious over relatively small situations. She is well-intentioned, though simple-minded, and Shep usually acts as a friend and mentor to Teeny, in contrast to Angora, who frequently teases her. ===Angora=== Angora is a gray, long-haired Turkish Angora with bangs that sweep over her eyes, white chest tuft, green eyes and a pink collar. She is often dismissive of other animals, and feels that she deserves better treatment than anyone else, due to her self-absorbed and arrogant nature. Angora's favorite people are Chloe and Zoey because they're so much like her. A running gag in the series involves her love of trouble (and hatred of peace) at Horseland. However, she shows genuine concern whenever Shep and Teeny are in true danger. ===Cubby=== Cubby is a brown Pomeranian puppy. He was found abandoned by Bailey in \\"New Pup in Town\\". Bailey later adopted Cubby in that same episode. Alma becomes jealous because she wants a dog, but because her dad is the foreman at Horseland she's not allowed to have one. Shep is initially jealous of Cubby. When Cubby runs away Alma and Shep put their jealous feelings aside and help Bailey bring him home. Alma takes Bailey up on his offer to share Cubby with him. Shep and Cubby eventually become friends. ==Secondary charactersSimbala and Ranak=== Simbala is an Indian girl who meets the Horseland gang on a trip to France in the episode \\"International Sarah\\". She is thoughtful, sweet-natured, and is proud of her culture, choosing to wear traditional dress and a bindi. Her father knows Sarah's father, and the two girls became friends after falling into a cave. She loves riding, fresh fruit, and dental floss. Simbala's horse is Ranak, a black stallion with a blaze. He hates plane rides, but enjoys sugar cubes and being alone. After initially irritating the other horses with his worried whinnying, he apologizes and becomes friendly to them. He also has an accent. His color is dark blue. ===Jesse Golden and Buddy=== Jesse is a boy who visits Horseland while his parents' farm, Golden Corral Ranch, is being remodeled. He appears in the episode \\"Bailey's New Friend\\", in which he unintentionally causes a rift between Bailey and Sarah. Like Bailey, he enjoys video games, taking care of his horse, talking, and being a bit of a daredevil. Both Molly and Alma mention that he's a \\"cutie\\", and Chloe and Zoey express that they think he is \\"hot\\". Jesse's horse is Buddy, a large chocolate flaxen stallion. He is brave, headstrong, and misses his home while away. He has dark teal stripes in his mane and tail. ===Alexander Buglick and Bucephalus=== Alexander is Alma's pen pal, seen in the episode \\"First Love\\". While his letters to her made him seem like a wealthy champion rider, an intentional facade meant to impress her, he really only rides for fun, and is rather timid. His parents are the proprietors of a traveling circus. However, he admires Alma and her incredible riding abilities, and shares her love of reading. He likes to compare himself with the great Macedonian general, Alexander the Great. His horse is a kind, humble stallion named Bucephalus, in honor of Alexander the Great's famous steed. He performs in the circus and enjoys his life, despite its lack of glamour. His color is maroon. ===Mary Whitney and Prince=== Mary is Sarah and Chase's cousin, a humorous, independent girl who doesn't let the fact that she is blind get in the way of her positive attitude and independence. Mary appears in the episode \\"A True Gift.\\" She has a clever comeback for most insults that Zoey throws at her, and understandably dislikes it when her friends are patronizing toward her. She loves horses, riding, and the outdoors. Mary's horse is Prince, a white Thoroughbred stallion who is said to be the fastest horse ever to come to Horseland, a 'fact' that causes Scarlet to get jealous and worried that she'll be replaced. Sarah temporarily rode him in Scarlet's place in order to make sure that he was a good enough horse for Mary. He also has a white wavy mane and tail with light blue highlights. ===Talia Bentley and Kisses=== Talia is a talented but mean-spirited girl who is both confident and competitive. She appears in the episode \\"Changing Spots\\" and is the premier show jumper at Stanhope Academy, Horseland's biggest rival. She is Alma's nemesis, and the two show special animosity towards each other after they get in a fight about who deserves to win an upcoming competition. Talia's horse is Kisses, a beautiful Camarillo White Horse mare. She is an excellent show jumper, but is never given a chance to speak to any of the other horses. Her highlight color is light pink. ===Chase Whitney and Wonder=== Chase is Sarah and Mary's cousin who comes to visit in the episode 'The Secret.' He feels embarrassed about his dyslexia and tries to hide his difficulty with reading from the others. Chase has light brown hair and blue eyes. His horse Wonder is a dark bay Anglo- Arabian stallion with green stripes. Wonder never talks to any of the horses in the episode. ==Other charactersJasmine and Amber=== Jasmine and Amber are two of Molly's close friends from the city. Both of the girls are confident, loud, and playful, and enjoy having a good time all the time. Neither of them go to Horseland, but do express an interest in horseback riding. Despite frequently teasing Molly, the two are genuinely supportive of her interests. Amber is African-American, and has dark brown eyes and long wavy hair. Jasmine is of an Asian ethnicity, and has light hazel eyes and dark-colored hair. ===Linnea, Alexia and Windy=== Linnea is a princess that visits Horseland in disguise, pretending to be the princess' assistant, while Alexia, her maid, pretends to be the princess. Both have light blonde hair, blue eyes, and favor the color light pink, although Alexia is much shorter than her companion. Throughout the episode, Linnea becomes close friends with Sarah. Linnea's horse is Windy, a mare who looks like Talia's Kisses and wears an ornate bridle. She also has a volumous wavy mane and tail. She doesn't understand English and only speaks her native tongue, and fails to respond to any of the other horses' attempts to speak to her, causing them to think she was rude. ===Diablo=== Diablo is a red Welsh stallion with an injured back leg who belongs to a girl named Madison. He initially has aggressive and rude behavior and was brought to Horseland so that Sarah could use her \\"way with horses\\" to try to help him recover. His only appearance is \\"The Horse Whisperer\\". His name means \\"devil\\" in Spanish. He also has a wavy mane and tail. He is voiced by D. Kevin Williams. ===Puma=== Puma is a buckskin mustang stallion staying at Horseland to be tamed by Will. His mane and tail are black with white stripes. His only appearance is in the episode \\"Wild Horses\\". He tells Aztec about what it's like living in the wild, which prompts Aztec to run away. Puma, however, loved the wonderful treatment he was given at Horseland. It is mentioned that he loves oats, which is shown in the same episode. ===Wild Horses=== These horses are met by Aztec when he runs away from Horseland. The two identified by name are Chaco, a black mustang stallion who doesn't want Aztec on their territory, and Mesa, a cream colt that befriends Aztec. Other horses in the herd are a pair of bays, Mesa's cream mother, and a brown paint female. They all have plain manes and tails. ===River=== River is a famous racehorse stallion that comes to Horseland to recuperate from a leg injury. He is dark grey with a white mane and tail, and has periwinkle stripes. His only appearance is \\"A Horse Named River\\", during which it's revealed that he's become an elderly, unenthusiastic horse, nothing like the speedy youthful stallion Chili's been a fan of his whole life. He was younger and belonged to an unnamed girl in flashbacks. ===Cream and Sugar=== Cream is a white-colored colt that has light pink stripes, while Sugar is a light gray filly that has light blue stripes. They are fraternal twins, and only appear in the episode \\"Oh, Baby\\". They visit Horseland when their mother was sick and couldn't take care of them. ==Additional Voices== *Dana Donlan as Sarah Whitney *Emily Hernandez as Alma Rodriguez *Bianca Heyward as Chloe Stilton *Caroline Iliff as Zoey Stilton/Chloe Stilton, Season 3 *David Kalis as Bailey Handler *Jerry Longe as Shep *Laura Marr *Vincent Michael as Will Taggert *Marissa Shea *Aleyah Smith as Molly Washington *Michelle Zacharia *Joe Dinghman *Ben Birkholtz *Courtney Britt *Tifanie Christun as Pepper *Stephen Shelton *Andrea Ware as Scarlet *Kelcey Watson *Tiffany White-Welchen *D.

Taylor, M. P., & Naish, D. (2005). The phylogenetic taxonomy of Diplodocoidea (Dinosauria: Sauropoda). Museum of Paleontology, University of California, Berkeley. Among sauropods, camarasaurids are small to medium-sized, with relatively short necks. They are visually identifiable by a short skull with large nares, and broad, spatulate teeth filling a thick jaw.1\\\\. Weishampel, D. B., Dodson, P., & Osm√≥lska, H. (Eds.). (1990). The dinosauria. Univ of California Press. Based on cervical vertebrae and cervical rib biomechanics, camarasaurids most likely moved their necks in a vertical, rather than horizontal, sweeping motion, in contrast to most diplodocids. Cladistically, they are defined to be all sauropods more closely related to Camarasaurus supremus than to Saltasaurus loricatus. == Diagnostic characters == Several skeletal features have been used to characterize the camarasaurids. In the skull, these include an external narial diameter approximately 40% of the long-axis length of the skull, an arched internarial bar, a short muzzle anterior to the nares, and maxillary shelf. In the rest of the axial skeleton, these include flat ventral faces on the cervical vertebrae, a triangular flare to the neural spines of the middle and posterior dorsal vertebrae, and a concave posterior surface to the anterior thoracic ribs, as well as an external haemal canal across the anterior vertebrae of the tail.Wilson, J. A., & Sereno, P. C. (1998). Early evolution and higher-level phylogeny of sauropod dinosaurs. Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, 18(S2), 1-79. A reduction to two carpals, long metacarpals relative to the radius, and a twisted ischial shaft serve to identify the appendicular skeleton. == Palaeobiogeography == Broadly speaking, camarasaurids occupied a distribution limited to the Laurasian continent during the Upper Jurassic. Most currently accepted camarasaurid specimens have been discovered in the Morrison Formation of North America, however some specimens from the African Tendaguru Formation have been speculated to belong to the genus Camarasaurus, and the closely related Lourinhasaurus was found in Portugal.FosteR, J.

The EDC was founded in 2000 and is incorporated in Massachusetts. The full legal name of the organization is the Eating Disorders Coalition for Research, Policy & Action. The EDC works with the U.S. Congress, with the executive branch of government, with national nonprofit organizations, and with the media to focus attention on the need for better treatment, research, and prevention of anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), binge eating disorder (BED), and eating disorders not otherwise specified (ED-NOS). The United States spends relatively little money on eating disorder-specific programs and research. For example, in 2006 the U.S. spent $21 million on eating disorders research for a population of 5-10 million sufferers. By comparison, in 2006 over $300 million ($USD) was spent on schizophrenia, which impacts approximately the same number of people as eating disorders. In 2008 the Eating Disorders Coalition provided extensive support for a national public awareness campaign organized by Congressman Patrick Kennedy of Rhode Island and Congressman Jim Ramstad of Minnesota. The campaign included town hall rallies across the country in which people with eating disorders or their surviving family members spoke about barriers to treatment and called for legislation to expand access to care. The EDC also identified speakers for a series of congressional hearings organized by Rep. Kennedy.

He also played in the Football League with Wolverhampton Wanderers, Hartlepool United and Oldham Athletic, before moving into Non-league football with Eastwood Town, Stalybridge Celtic, Worksop Town and Gainsborough Trinity. ==Career== Born in Hiller√∏d, Budtz became an instant hero in his first game for Doncaster Rovers when he replaced the injured Andy Warrington during a League Cup tie against Manchester City in September 2005. He saved two of the three penalties taken by the Premier League side during the shootout to send Doncaster into the next round (the first penalty, by Darius Vassell, hit the crossbar). His name was subsequently plastered all over local and national newspapers the following day and he also made several appearances on local TV news channels.Budtz unfazed by Man City stars, BBC Sport, 22 September 2005 Following his initial day of glory, he largely failed to progress though.

Alcan (Paris), 1894. Louis Denis Jules Gavarret, sometimes referred to as Louis Dominique Jules Gavarret (28 January 1809 - 30 August 1890) was a French physician who advocated the use of statistics in medicine. ==Life== Gavarret was born in Astaffort, Lot-et-Garonne. He studied at the Ecole Polytechnique in Paris, followed by military service as an artillery officer. In 1833 he resigned his commission and began his studies with Gabriel Andral (1797‚Äì1876). Gavarret is remembered for the systemization and expansion of Pierre Charles Alexandre Louis' (1787-1872) statistical methodology in regards to medicine. Pierre Louis' contention was to make medicine an exact science in diagnosis of a medical condition, and also to refute the \\"inductive approach\\" that was prevalent at the time. Gavarret was a major proponent of the statistical method. He emphasized that the process would only work under certain conditions, such as the medical cases must be comparable, and there has to exist enough examples to reach an exact conclusion. Gavarett's precision or \\"confidence rate\\" was calculated to be 99.5% or a ratio of 212:1. In essence, the two doctors believed that through knowledge of the aggregate patient data, the disease and treatment would be understood. In 1840, Gavarret and Gabriel Andral were the first to show that blood composition varied depending on the pathological condition of the subject. Their research demonstrated the value of blood chemistry as a means of confirming diagnoses. His later work largely dealt with topics in the fields of biophysics and physiology, that included research of acoustic and phonation phenomena. == Writings == * Sur les modifications de properties de quelques principes du sang (fibrine, globules, materiaux solides du s√©rum, et eau) dans les maladies.

Studios, written by Dan Abnett and Ian Edginton. Set in the fictional world of Warhammer 40,000, it is a vision of never-ending war. Its storyline follows several different Space Marines of the Black Templars chapter. ==Characters and plot== The series follows several characters in each issue. Dates and places are given in the form of crusade names and battlefields. Sword Brethren Gerhart, part of Marshal Korneliusz's Company, is followed fighting at the battle of Carrion Gulf, during the Third Year of the Torment Crusade, fighting Chaos Space Marines. He is seen earlier fighting Necrons at the Succubae Gates, where his fellow Space Marines fear he has too much pride, a sin to the Black Templar Space Marines. While declaring his own feats of victory, his brothers try and persuade him that they are merely servants of the Emperor, and how that they fight only for His glory. He is called away by Marshal Korneliusz, who subtly warns him of his sinning, at which Gerhart sees how he was wrong to act in the way that he was. Gerhart is then shown going to a chapel, meeting with Chaplain Ecastus to ask forgiveness of his vanity and ego, only for the Chaplain to say that Gerhart has none, and only chases battle to praise the Emperor. Later, Gerhart is part of the assault on Magnum Christi, a minor moon on a back-water planet that had been taken over by the forces of Chaos. The Chaos forces flee, despite having both the troops and the tactical positions to drag out the fight. Gerhart and other fellow Space Marines follow the retreating forces of Chaos, only to find why Chaos had invaded the planet; Two Titans, legendary machines of war, have been found by the forces of Chaos. As his squad mates die one by one in duels with Chao Astartes and with Brother Skeld's reinforcements en route but delayed, Brother Gerhart makes a final stand. Brother Tankred is a Dreadnought. who is awakened by Techmarine Arnulf to fight on the Eve of the Kasiroth Offensive. The Kasiroth Offensive is a battle against Tau, where Tankred suffers damage from a Battlesuit, although Tankred makes short work of it soon after. Tankred is next shown awakening before repairs from the previous battle were carried out. As the servitors under Arnulf's command scurry for more chemicals to soothe Tankred back to sleep, Tankred declares he has had enough sleep and wishes to speak to Arnulf of previous battles and times, despite the pain of being repaired. When Tankred next awakes, it has been over two centuries and Arnulf is dead, replaced by Techmarine Piramus, his Adept. Piramus informs Tankred on the situation, that Tankred is tasked with destroying a Daemon Prince of Chaos that has destroyed countless Imperial Forces sent to destroy it. Recruit Raclaw, on Kilhaven, has been chosen to join the Black Templars after being forced to fight for his life against fellow kinsmen and an alien tiger- creature called a Carnodon. Victorious, he is chosen to be tutored in the ways of war by Brother Brunner. Raclaw is then shown after going through the rigorous surgical process of becoming a Space Marine. His first test is fighting and killing another recruit whose body reacted violently with the surgical process and is no more than a ravening monster. Raclaw goes on to suffocate it with the very broken chains that kept it secured to a wall. Raclaw is then shown having become a Neophyte, about to be led into battle against Orks, and survives the battle, causing many casualties against the Greenskin forces after fighting back to back with Brother Cassius. Shortly after, Raclaw and Brunner are part of the Relief of Helespont, where they fight against the forces of the Eldar. Brunner is killed, ripped in half by a Wraithlord. After the battle, which the Black Templars are victorious, Brother Tove replaces the deceased Brunner as Raclaw's Initiate. The ending of the six-part story shows Raclaw being elevated to the status of Initiate after six decades of training and taking Brunner's forename, \\"Gerhart\\", as his own. As the ending unfolds, it seems that Raclaw was Brother Gerhart when he was a Neophyte, and after taking serious and mortal wounds while fighting a successful last stand in the Battle of Carrion Gulf on Magnum Christi, Brother Gerhart was in turn placed in Dreadnought armour. Meanwhile, the Dreadnought Tankred is shown fighting the unnamed Daemon Prince and, although badly damaged, he manages to slay the monster. Shortly after the battle, he is shown being tended to by Techmarine Piramus when Brother Tove, whose full name is revealed to be \\"Tove Skeld\\", enters the room where Tankred is hoisted for repairs. He tells the Techmarine that Tove was once Tankred's Initiate and later his Brother-in-Arms. Now that it is known that Tankred was once Brother Gerhart of the Sword Brethren, and before that he was Neophyte Raclaw. The story ends with a barely conscious Tankred saying \\"Tankred endures...\\", alluding to the idea that the whole plot revolves around one individual rather than three different ones, to which Tove replies, \\"As do we all, Brother ‚Äì In the Emperor's Name!\\". The twist ending of the story is due to its nonlinear storytelling. ==See also== *Warhammer 40,000 comics *Blood and Thunder, the next Warhammer 40k series *Forge of War, Warhammer Fantasy comic by the same writing team ==References== * ==External links== * Boom Studios * Preview of issue #1, Comic Book Resources, 19 December 2006 * Dan Abnett talks Boom‚Äôs ‚ÄúWarhammer 40K‚Äù Comic, Comic Book Resources, 11 September 2006 * Edginton Lifts Off with ‚ÄúWarhammer 40,000‚Äù, Comic Book Resources, 17 November 2006 * Bringing The Warhammer Down: Dan Abnett on Warhammer 40K: The Damnation Crusade, Newsarama, 22 December 2006 * Review of issue #1, Comics Bulletin * Review of the trade paperback, Comics Bulletin Category:2006 comics debuts Category:Comics by Dan Abnett Category:Comics by Ian Edginton Category:Warhammer 40,000 comics ","title":"Damnation Crusade"},{"id":"9114062","text":"The Nandi Award for Best Children Film was commissioned in 1999: { cellspacing=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" border=\\"0\\" width=\\"50%\\" - bgcolor=\\"#d1e4fd\\" !

Most famous of these was a 1961 version of \\"Wimoweh\\", which showed off Denver's falsetto yodelling register. He reached the Top 20 with his first five yodel-based singles. ==Career== Denver was born Angus Murdo McKenzie in Springburn, Glasgow and was well travelled by the time he took up singing, having had a previous career in the Norwegian Merchant Navy. He also had a country music influence, having lived in Nashville, Tennessee, US for a short time before being deported from there as an illegal immigrant in 1959. In the US, he adopted the new name that he retained for the remainder of his singing career. In the early 1960s, he formed a trio which included Kevin Neill (25 July 1931, Manchester, Lancashire ‚Äì 13 March 2010, Blackley, Manchester) and Gerry Cottrell (born Gerard Cottrell, 18 December 1933, Manchester, Lancashire ‚Äì 24 November 2006). Denver's song, \\"Never Goodbye\\", was an entry in A Song for Europe in 1962 and was another chart hit. In 1963, he appeared in the film Just for Fun, along with Bobby Vee, the Vernons Girls, and various other American and British pop music acts. He also appeared on BBC Radio a few times alongside The Beatles on a show named after a song he performed with them called \\"Side by Side\\". After the mid-1960s, Denver worked mainly on the cabaret circuit. However, in 1989 he enjoyed a brief raise in profile after guesting on Madchester band, the Happy Mondays' single, \\"Lazyitis (One-Armed Boxer)\\", on Factory Records (FAC 222). Denver also appeared in The Happy Mondays' video for the song, although he contracted pneumonia whilst filming the video. Following this collaboration Factory released two further Denver recordings, \\"Wimoweh '89\\" (FAC 228) and \\"Indambinigi\\" (FAC 278; credited to Karl Denver and Steve Lima). In 1993 he released his final album, Just Loving You, aimed at the country music market. In mid-1998, Denver began recording a new album, but died before full recording of the album was completed. The finished tracks were included on a re-release of Just Loving You entitled Movin' On in 1999. The final song he recorded was \\"I Can't Go on This Way\\". ==Death== Karl Denver's wooden grave marker, Stockport Cemetery Denver died from a brain tumour in December 1998, at the age of 67.

His father was internationally renowned watercolorist John Whorf.http://www.artfact.com/artist/whorf-john-t815pikrpe Whorf's sisters Carol Whorf Westcott and Nancy Whorf Kelly were also Provincetown artists, and his brother John was an established applied artist in Hingham. Whorf is nephew of linguist Benjamin Lee Whorf and nephew of actor and television director Richard Whorf. Whorf graduated from Provincetown High School in 1950. Upon graduation, Whorf enlisted in the United States Air Force (USAF) where he served as a radio announcer and entertainer on the Armed Forces Network. His tour of duty included assignments at air bases in California, Texas and Morocco. ==Professional history== After his honorable discharge from the USAF, Whorf worked as an announcer at WOCB in West Yarmouth, Massachusetts and at WCOJ in Coatesville, Pennsylvania, where he met and married his wife Barbara Ann Brown. He later developed the Kaleidoscope predecessor \\"Tempo\\" while on the air at WTAG in Worcester, Massachusetts. Whorf also worked briefly at WWL in New Orleans, Louisiana before returning to WTAG. Shortly after, he went on to WJR. Throughout the late 1960s and 1970s, Whorf was part of a line-up of radio personalities known throughout the region including J. P. McCarthy, Karl Haas, Jimmy Launce and MLB Hall of Fame broadcaster Ernie Harwell. Whorf's Kaleidoscope topics ranged from religion to politics, from the arts to sports. Some of Whorf's extended series included oral histories of Native American tribes and a collection of personal interviews with popular American song composers of the 1920s and 1930s entitled \\"The Bards of Tinpan Alley\\". Whorf is himself a published composer.

Westcott III on radio dramas and comedies that were featured during the Kaleidoscope hour, including the old- time radio parodies \\"Big Jim Small\\" and \\"Another Man‚Äôs Family.\\" Whorf briefly parted from WJR from 1983 to 1984 to serve as program director of classical station WQRS-FM in Detroit. While with WQRS, Whorf created the program \\"Quest for Excellence,\\" a juried music competition show for young talents broadcast live before a studio audience. Whorf later brought that program to CKLW in Windsor, Ontario and took it with him upon his return to WJR. Whorf's programs were also broadcast by WVXU-FM, the National Public Radio affiliate station of Xavier University in Cincinnati, Ohio. In addition to his Peabody-winning work on topics including the life and times of Martin Luther King Jr., Whorf also received multiple broadcasting awards from the Freedoms Foundation at Valley Forge.

He died a heroic death and was honored by his native state. He was a 1998 inductee into the Florida Artists Hall of Fame.Gamble Rogers Florida Artists Hall of Fame ==Biography== Born in Winter Park, Florida, Rogers was the namesake of two prominent architects in the family ‚Äì his father James Gamble Rogers II and great-uncle James Gamble Rogers. As a young man, he chose to become a musician‚Äîwhile on his way to interview for a job at an architecture firm, he attended a Serendipity Singers audition in New York City,The Oracle of Oklawaha: Gamble Rogers, Southern gentlemen, Fretboard Journal, Fall 2006 borrowed a guitar, tried out, and was admitted to the group. Gamble Rogers began performing around Florida in the 1960s, often performing with other noted Florida singer-songwriters Paul Champion, Jim Bellew, and Will McLean. By the 1970s, he was a regular fixture at the Florida Folk Festival, often as the headliner. He appeared in James Szalapski's 1976 country music documentary film Heartworn Highways, performing an onstage comic monologue followed by \\"Black Label Blues.\\" By the 1980s, he was often featured on public television and public radio. As a self-described \\"modern troubadour,\\" Rogers influenced musicians such as Jimmy Buffett and David Bromberg, with the former dedicating his album Fruitcakes to him. In their tribute to him, \\"Song for Gamble,\\" Steve Gillette and his wife Cindy Mangsen describe him: \\"He had the gift of innocence, and a fondness for the key of 'E'.\\" While Rogers was camping at Flagler Beach, a frightened young girl ran to him, begging him to help her father, who was in trouble in rough surf. Compromised by spinal arthritis that had been worsening since childhood, Rogers nevertheless grabbed an air mattress and headed into the ocean in a rescue attempt. Both men died in the surf. In honor of his heroism, the Florida Legislature renamed the state park Gamble Rogers Memorial State Recreation Area at Flagler Beach. In St. Augustine, Florida, there is a middle school, Gamble Rogers Middle School, named after him. ==Songs and stories== The characters and places in the fictional Oklawaha County, are a recurring theme in Rogers' songs and stories, although his earlier works referenced characters of the same names residing in non-fictional Winter Park, Florida and Habersham County, Georgia. Through years of onstage apprenticeship, Rogers refined and polished his one-man show into a single story line ‚Äì a continuum he entitled, Oklawaha County Laissez- Faire. ==Oklawaha records== During the years since Rogers' death, his agent and business manager, Charles Steadham, acquired the intellectual property rights to Rogers' work and founded Oklawaha Records in Gainesville, Florida to present this material. Steadham has remastered and re-released most of Rogers' songs and stories, making them available through the website of the not-for- profit Gamble Rogers Memorial Foundation, Inc.http://www.gamblerogers.org { cellpadding=2 cellspacing=2 width=600px style=\\"font-family: verdana, sans- serif; padding: 6px; margin: 0 0 1em 1em; font-size: 11px; background-color: #f7f8ff; border:1px solid #8888aa;\\" - style=background:#ccccff !Catalog Number !Album/CD !Year !Originally published by !Original Year - OK1001The Lord Gives Me Grace And the Devil Gives Me Style1996Mountain Railroad Records, Inc1977 - OK1002Gamble Rogers Live: The Warm Way Home1996Mountain Railroad Records, Inc1980 - OK1003Sorry Is As Sorry Does2001Flying Fish Records1986 - OK1004Oklawaha County Laissez- Faire1996Oklawaha Records1996 - OK1005Signs of a Misspent Youth1999Oklawaha Records1999 - OK1006Good Causes2003Oklawaha Records2003 } ==Award== Gamble Rogers was posthumously awarded the Kiwanis Award for bravery, the Carnegie Award for heroism, induction into the Florida Artists Hall of FameFlorida Folk Heritage Award and the NSA Lifetime Achievement Award (2001). ==References== ==External links== * Gamble Rogers Memorial Foundation *Recording of Rogers performing \\"Orange Blossom Special\\" at the 1982 Florida Folk Festival *Florida Folklife Collection; images and recordings *Gamble Rogers Memorial State Recreation homepage from the Florida Park Service online guide * Gamble Rogers Folk Festival Category:1937 births Category:1991 deaths Category:20th-century American guitarists Category:20th- century American singers Category:American folk guitarists Category:American folk musicians Category:American male guitarists Category:American singer- songwriters Category:Deaths by drowning Category:Folk record labels Category:Guitarists from Florida Category:People from Winter Park, Florida Category:Singers from Florida Category:Songwriters from Florida Category:20th- century American male musicians ","title":"Gamble Rogers"},{"id":"9114281","text":"\\"Junk\\" is a song written by English musician Paul McCartney and released on his debut studio album McCartney (1970). He wrote the song in 1968 with the Beatles while the group were studying Transcendental Meditation in India. After the band's return from India, he recorded the song as a demo at Kinfauns, George Harrison's home, before sessions for The Beatles (also known as \\"the White Album\\") took place. It was ultimately passed over for inclusion on The Beatles and Abbey Road in 1969. After the group's break-up, McCartney recorded the song for inclusion on McCartney. The lyrics describe various items in a junkyard. A slightly longer, instrumental version of the song, titled \\"Singalong Junk\\", also appears on the album. ==History== McCartney wrote \\"Junk\\", along with another McCartney track \\"Teddy Boy\\", during the Beatles' visit to India in 1968. The song was one of several the Beatles demoed at George Harrison's Kinfauns home before the recording of The Beatles in May 1968. The Esher demo was eventually released on Anthology 3 in 1996 and on the Super Deluxe edition of the \\"White Album\\" in 2018. While the song was considered for The Beatles (also known as the \\"White Album\\"), it was not included; neither did it find a place on Abbey Road. McCartney eventually recorded the song, along with \\"Teddy Boy\\", in February 1970 for his debut solo album McCartney. The song's working title was \\"Jubilee\\"; it was also known as \\"Junk in the Yard\\". Take one appeared on the McCartney album as \\"Singalong Junk\\", whereas take two was issued as \\"Junk\\". \\"Junk\\" was included on an EP (along with \\"Another Day\\", \\"Oh Woman, Oh Why\\" and \\"Valentine Day\\") released only in Mexico. The song has been dropped from his live setlist, but was included on the compilations Wingspan: Hits and History (2001) and Pure McCartney (2016). ==Composition== The lyrics of \\"Junk\\" have McCartney describe numerous contents of a junkyard, including parachutes, army boots, and sleeping bags for two. The song's chorus: \\"Buy, buy, says the sign in the shop window/why, why, says the junk in the yard\\" illustrate what it's like for these items. Beside the exclusion of vocals, \\"Singalong Junk\\" features mellotron strings and the melody is played on a piano. That version also features more prominent drums. \\"Singalong Junk\\" is said to have been the original instrumental backing over which McCartney planned to sing, but he opted for a simpler arrangement for the vocal version instead. ==Reception== Since release, \\"Junk\\" has received positive reviews from music critics, with many considering it a highlight of its parent album. In a review for McCartney on initial release, Langdon Winner of Rolling Stone complimented the album's use of simplicity, saying that it \\"works very well.\\" Winner praised \\"Junk\\" and \\"Teddy Boy\\", describing both as \\"low pressure compositions with gentle, poignant lessons to convey\\" that are \\"very tasteful and fun to listen to.\\" Donald A. Guarisco of AllMusic considers \\"Junk\\" of the \\"finest moments\\" on McCartney, describing it as \\"a melancholy charmer of a ballad that has become a cult favorite with McCartney fans.\\" Guarisco further praises McCartney's vocal performance, writing that it \\"captures [the song's] wistful mood nicely.\\" In a retrospective review for McCartney, Record Collector has highlighted \\"Junk\\", along with \\"Every Night\\" and \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\", as songs that \\"still sound absolutely effortless and demonstrate the man's natural genius with a melody\\". Joe Tangari of Pitchfork similarly evaluated both \\"Junk\\" and \\"Singalong Junk\\", with \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\", as the \\"peaks\\" of McCartney. ==Personnel== ;\\"Junk\\" *Paul McCartney ‚Äì lead vocals, acoustic guitar, bass guitar, xylophone, drums *Linda McCartney ‚Äì backing vocals ;\\"Singalong Junk\\" *Paul McCartney ‚Äì acoustic and electric guitar, bass guitar, piano, mellotron, drums ==Live versions== *The song called \\"Junk\\" on McCartney's 1991 album Unplugged (The Official Bootleg) is played without vocals, thereby making it \\"Singalong Junk\\", but it is not listed as such on the album. *McCartney first performed \\"Junk\\" live, in the Ghost Suite at the Royal Albert Hall, on 3 November 2006. ==Cover versions== *Sandie Shaw recorded a version of the song which appeared as a bonus track on the 2004 re- issue of her 1969 album Reviewing the Situation. *John Denver covered the song on his 1971 album Poems, Prayers & Promises. *Chet Atkins recorded an instrumental version that appears on the 1971 album Pickin' My Way. *Cilla Black covered the song on her 1971 album Images which was produced by George Martin. *Anne Sofie von Otter and Elvis Costello covered the song, as part of a medley with \\"Broken Bicycles\\" by Tom Waits, on their 2001 album For the Stars. *After leaving The Inbreds, vocalist Mike O'Neill released a cover version of the song via his website in 2003.

During the mid-1980s the Beneficial Life tower achieved notoriety when a rare breeding pair of peregrine falcons decided to take residence on the company letters on the north side of the building. Around 2006, Beneficial moved to the former Kennecott building on an opposite corner of the same block. Both buildings remained while almost the entirety of the block was torn down, along with neighboring blocks of downtown Salt Lake City, and turned into a new development called the City Creek Center. == References == Category:Deseret Management Corporation Category:Life insurance companies of the United States Category:American companies established in 1905 Category:Financial services companies established in 1905 Category:Financial services companies of the United States Category:Companies based in Salt Lake City Category:1905 establishments in Utah ","title":"Beneficial Financial Group"},{"id":"9114320","text":"S√∏r-Tr√∏ndelag University College (Norwegian: H√∏gskolen i S√∏r-Tr√∏ndelag) or HiST was a Norwegian university college located in Trondheim.

He immigrated to Brooklyn from Sicily with his wife in 1905. Messina and his family arrived in Boston by 1915 and retired as head of the Boston Mafia in 1932. He was succeeded by Phil Buccola. Messina died on June 15, 1957, in Somerville, Massachusetts. ==Early life== Gaspare Messina was born on August 7, 1879, in Salemi, Sicily, to Luciano Messina and his wife, Gaspara Clementi. Gaspare married Francesca Riggio on November 4, 1905, in Salemi. Within the same month the couple immigrated to United States, arriving in New York Harbor on November 25, 1905, for an extended honeymoon. The couple settled in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn and decided to stay in the United States permanently. While living in Brooklyn with a growing family, Messina opened a bakery and joined the local mafia that would later become known as the Bonanno crime family. ==Boston== By 1915, Messina and his family had moved to Boston. He opened a new bakery there and soon became recognized as the boss of the local Sicilian-based mafia. The exact circumstances of his crime family's formation and his elevation to boss are unknown. All that is certain is that he arrived in Boston by 1915, and in Nicola Gentile recalled being invited to a banquet in his honor in 1921 by Messina, the local mafia boss in Boston. In 1923, the U.S. Secret Service found evidence of Messina's involvement in a counterfeiting scheme when they arrested Salvatore Leonardi, finding a letter in his possession addressed to Messina and discovered that Messina had sent a $100 money order to the leaders of the scheme. Over fifty people were arrested for being involved in the scheme to distribute a half-million dollars worth of counterfeit $10 Federal Reserve Bank of Boston notes. Messina was never charged in the scheme, but he took an extended trip to Sicily, returning in December 1924. In 1925, Messina was the president of a wholesale grocery business called G. Messina & Company. One of his partners in the business, Frank Cucchiara, was arrested on March 26, 1925 for possession of guns, six sticks of dynamite and 96 ounces of morphine. Later that year, Cucchiara was fined $50 for running an illegal lottery. Around 1927, Messina and his family moved to the nearby suburb of Somerville. In a December 1930 meeting in Boston, Messina was selected to become a temporary capo di capi, by fellow mafiosi after stripping the title from Joe Masseria during Masseria's struggle with rival gangster Salvatore Maranzano, often referred to as the Castellammarese War. Maranzano acquired the title after he proved victorious in the conflict. ==Death== According to an FBI listening device placed in Raymond Patriarca's office, Messina stepped down as boss in 1932 and was replaced by Phil Buccola. After his retirement he retained an \\"advisory\\" role to his successors. Messina died on June 15, 1957, in Somerville, Massachusetts. ==See also== *Black Hand (extortion) ==References== ==External links== *Biography of Messina on The American Mafia website Category:1879 births Category:1957 deaths Category:Patriarca crime family Category:American mobsters of Sicilian descent Category:People from North End, Boston Category:Italian emigrants to the United States Category:Criminals from Massachusetts Category:Capo dei capi ","title":"Gaspare Messina"},{"id":"9114376","text":"Cover of Sommelier India Sommelier India - The Wine Magazine is an Indian wine magazine dedicated to wine and the culture surrounding wine.

Sir John Clifton's father was a London merchant, Sir William Clifton (d.1564), who had purchased the manor of Barrington from Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Suffolk.Victoria County History, Vol.4, Somerset, Baggs, A.P. & Bush, R.J.E., Bush, Parishes: Barrington ed.

In 1591, he became a Knight of the Shire of Huntingdonshire, settled in Leighton Bromswold and married Katherine, a daughter of Sir Henry Darcy (a previous Knight of the Shire) that year and was knighted by 1597. From 1597 to 1598 and also in 1601, Clifton was MP for Huntingdonshire. In 1605 he sold his paternal estate of Barrington Court and moved his seat to Leighton Bromswold, County Huntingdon. In 1608 he was raised to the Peerage by writ of summons Baron Clifton, of Leighton Bromswold, County Huntingdon. This ancient form of creation by writ enabled the title to descend via female lines. On 30 December 1617, Lord Clifton was imprisoned in the Tower of London for threatening Sir Francis Bacon when the latter ordered a survey of Clifton's land. He was then prosecuted by the Star Chamber on 17 March 1618 and moved to Fleet Prison, where he stabbed himself to death in the following October. His only son had died in 1602 as a result of wounds received from a bear, which had broken free during a bear-baiting show at Nottingham, and so Clifton's title passed to his daughter, Katherine. ==References== ==Sources== * History of Parliament * Tudor Place * Burke's Peerage & Gentry, 107th edition Category:1570s births Category:1618 deaths Category:Alumni of St Alban Hall, Oxford Category:Nobility who committed suicide Category:Suicides in London Category:Suicides by sharp instrument in England Category:People who committed suicide in prison custody Category:English people who died in prison custody Category:Prisoners who died in England and Wales detention Gervase Category:Inmates of Fleet Prison Category:English MPs 1597‚Äì1598 Category:English MPs 1601 Category:Members of Gray's Inn Category:Male suicides Category:British politicians who committed suicide 1 ","title":"Gervase Clifton, 1st Baron Clifton"},{"id":"9114403","text":"Wichita Northeast Magnet High School, known locally as Northeast, is a magnet high school for the Wichita USD 259 public school district, and is located in Bel Aire, Kansas, United States. Wichita Northeast Magnet High School was the first magnet high school in Kansas. The magnet areas at Northeast include visual arts, science, and law. Students are also exposed to mathematics and language arts.

The responses indicated a very strong interest in science/technology as well as the visual arts. Wichita Northeast Magnet High School opened in 1990 as a secondary school of choice in the Community Education Center, originally called Mathewson Intermediate School. The Community Education Center site was chosen because of its proximity to Wichita State University. The colleges of Engineering and Fine Arts helped in the development of the program. Necessary remodeling was done and the Northeast Magnet High School began in August 1990 with the magnet choices of science/technology and visual art.A History of Wichita Public School Buildings; USD 259.

Since the first Urdu typewriter was made available in 1911, the layout has gone through various phases of evolution.Zia (1999a) With time, the variety of layouts introduced in the 1950s for mechanized compositions have reduced to very few that are compatible with the new digital age. Modern improvements in Urdu keyboard were pioneered by the National Language Authority (Muqtadra-e-Qaumi Zaban) in Pakistan, which standardized the linguistic aspects such as orthography and lexicography. These developments helped the keyboard layout to evolve from the typewriters to be compatible with computers, to increase the productivity and textual efficiency of the language, especially through modern electronic media. == Evolution of the Urdu keyboard == When Urdu was declared as the national language of the independent Pakistan in 1947, a variety of keyboard designs were quickly brought into the market by various individuals and organizations.Dil (1962) However, differences remained in the order of the keys and the number of characters. This underscored an urgent need for a standard form of keyboard adaptable for diverse users. === First generation === In 1963, the newly established Central Language Board in Pakistan standardardized the typewriter keyboard. The new standard keyboard also incorporated special characters of other provincial languages, such as Sindhi and Pushto. Languages spoken in Punjab and Balochistan could be easily accommodated within the Urdu characters. === Second generation === The keyboard was again modified in 1974. This time the layout was based on the frequency tables and bifurcation (balancing load on typist's fingers) techniques, and the characters relating to other languages were replaced with the numerals. === Third generation === In 1980, the National Language Authority of Pakistan developed a new keyboard layout for typewriters based on Naskh script. The keyboard had 46 keys to type 71 Urdu consonants, vowels, diacritics, and punctuation marks, and 21 key symbols for arithmetic calculations and digits. However, with the arrival of the digital age, the layout became inadequate for computerized processing that required softwareAfzal (1997) backup to select the shape of the character appropriate to the context, and the ability to store multiple language character sets.Zia (1996) These issues were addressed through the standardization of keyboardZia (1999b) for a bilingual teleprinter to use both English and Urdu. The new layout was found appropriate for use in computer-based applications and was immediately adopted with modifications for word processors. === Fourth generation === In 1998 National Language Authority, under Dr. Attash Durrani's supervision started working on a research and development project to standardize the Urdu encoding. This resulted in the formation of Urdu Zabta Takhti (ÿßÿ±ÿØŸà ÿ∂ÿßÿ®ÿ∑€Å ÿ™ÿÆÿ™€å) (UZT). In July 2000, UZT 1.01 was standardized for all kinds of electronic computing, communications, and storage.Afzal and Hussain (2002) Based on this version, Urdu language support was incorporated into the Versions 3.1 and 4.0 of Unicode. The Keyboard version 1 was finalized by NLA on December 14, 1999. In 2001, the National Database and Registration Authority of Pakistan fully adopted this keyboard for Data Entry operations of the Computerized National Identity Cards. Microsoft included this keyboard along with Urdu Language Locale in its Windows XP operating system for personal computers.Urdu language support at Microsoft website. Retrieved on 3 June 2008. This keyboard is now standard for the Urdu language. Developments in earlier part of 2008, led to the introduction of the 'ghost character theory' at the NLA, which allows for computerized orthographic representation of Perso-Arabic script. This enables wider scope of editing with the option of switching between the languages such as Arabic, Balochi, Pashto, Persian, Punjabi, and Sindhi respectively. === Phonetic Keyboard === Layout of Urdu Phonetic Keyboard Along with the UZT keyboards, phonetic keyboards have been developed for Urdu. Phonetic keyboards works with the sound of the words, e.g. 'a' button of the English keyboard contain an Urdu word which is similar to the sound of 'a' and same is the case for other characters. Though less common in the past, phonetic keyboards have seen wider use recently. CRULP (Center for research for Urdu language processing) has been working on phonetic keyboard designs for URDU and other local languages of Pakistan. Their Urdu Phonetic Keyboard Layout v1.1 for Windows is widely used and considered as a standard for typing Urdu on Microsoft platform. However it has not been adopted by Microsoft for any Windows platform.Parekh, R. (2008). Can Urdu become the language of the internet?. Dawn Newspaper. 24 June.

It falls on the same day as the International Missing Children's Day, which was established in 2001. In the several years preceding the establishment of National Missing Children's day, a series of high-profile missing-children cases made national headlines. On May 25, 1979, Etan Patz was only six years old when he disappeared from his New York City home on his way from bus to school. The date of his disappearance was designated as National Missing Children's Day. At the time, cases of missing children rarely garnered national media attention, but his case quickly received extensive coverage. His father, a professional photographer, distributed black-and-white photographs of him in an effort to find him. The resulting massive search and media attention that followed focused the public's attention on the problem of child abduction and the lack of plans to address it. For almost three years, media attention was focused on Atlanta, Georgia, where the bodies of young children were discovered in lakes, marshes, and ponds along roadside trails. Twenty-nine bodies were recovered in the Atlanta murders of 1979‚Äì1981 before a suspect was arrested and convicted. == See also == *International child abduction *International Missing Children's Day *National Center for Missing & Exploited Children ==References== ==External links== *FBI Category:May observances Category:Observances in the United States by presidential proclamation Category:Children's Day ","title":"National Missing Children's Day"},{"id":"9114607","text":"() in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia) is a former professional sumo wrestler and current politician of the Democratic Party in Mongolia. He was the first wrestler from Mongolia to reach sumo's top makuuchi division. ==Career== He was a diligent practitioner of Mongolian wrestling from a young age, but had ambitions of becoming a policeman. However, in late 1991, a Japanese sumo training stable master, ≈åshima-oyakata (the former ≈çzeki Asahikuni) went to Mongolia to recruit promising wrestlers for sumo. The young Davaagiin Batbayar happened to notice the advertisement and applied along with 120 others. He was selected and went to Japan with five others, including Kyukotenh≈ç and Kyokutenzan. They were the first Mongolians ever to join sumo. He was immediately given the shikona of Kyokush≈´zan, meaning \\"eagle mountain of the rising sun.\\" He made his professional debut in March 1992. However six months later, due to cultural differences, language problems, and an extremely hard training regime, five of them including Kyokush≈´zan ran away from the training stable to the Mongolian embassy. He was eventually persuaded to return by his stablemaster's wife, and also Kyokutenzan. In March 1995, he was promoted to the j≈´ry≈ç division, and in September 1996 to the top makuuchi division. After his single appearance as a komusubi in March 1997 he was ranked as a maegashira for 58 tournaments in a row, a record in the sumo world. He was a runner-up in two tournaments in March 2003 and September 2004, and was awarded five special prizes for his achievements in tournaments ‚Äì two for Technique, two for Fighting Spirit and one for Outstanding Performance. He also earned five kinboshi or gold stars for defeating yokozuna, the last coming in May 2003 against fellow Mongolian Asash≈çry≈´. Determined to get revenge in the next tournament in July, Asash≈çry≈´ pulled on Kyokush≈´zan's topknot; a foul for which he was disqualified (hansoku), the first time this had ever happened to a yokozuna (Kyokush≈´zan did not get a kinboshi on that occasion as they are not given for wins by hansoku). As he succeeded in the ring, his popularity in Mongolia soared. Also, as he has contributed much to his country by establishing several foundations for the welfare of the youth and sick people, he is now regarded as one of the heroes of the country. In April 2004, he started to study on a correspondence course for an MSc in telecommunications at Waseda University in Japan. This is partly because the Mongolian president advised him to study while in Japan for his future. ==Fighting style== At the beginning of his top division career he gained great popularity with audiences due to his variety of techniques, which were influenced by Mongolian wrestling. Less often seen in sumo, they surprised many of his early opponents. He was known as the gino depato, or \\"department store of techniques.\\" In the May 2002 tournament, he won his first eight bouts in a row, using eight different techniques. However, because he was in danger of injuring other wrestlers, he was eventually told by the Sumo Association to stop using some of them, and by the end of his career he had a much more defensive (and less successful) style. His most common winning kimarite overall were uwatenage (overarm throw) and yorikiri (force out), using his preferred mawashi grip of migi-yotsu (left hand outside, right hand inside). However his next most common were hatakikomi (slap down) and hikiotoshi (pull down), reflecting his change of style. ==Retirement from sumo== In November 2006, he suddenly announced his retirement two days into the Kyushu tournament. At the time this was thought to be because of a heart problem. A ceremony in his honour was held in Ulaanbaatar at the end of 2006, attended by the Mongolian Prime Minister, who thanked him for strengthening the ties between Mongolia and Japan. Kyokush≈´zan's danpatsu-shiki, the official retirement ceremony where the retired rikishi's topknot is cut off, was reportedly going to be held in Mongolia, but eventually took place at the Ry≈çgoku Kokugikan in Tokyo on June 2, 2007. Soon after the ceremony, on June 4, 2007, Kyokush≈´zan released his memorial photobook featuring Anna Tsuchiya.Êó≠È∑≤Â±±ÂºïÈÄÄË®òÂøµ„Éû„Ç¨„Ç∏„É≥„Åß„Ç≥„É©„Éú It subsequently emerged that Kyokush≈´zan was the victim of an attempted extortion by gangsters, linked to the Sumiyoshi-kai crime syndicate. The gangsters were all arrested, and Kyokush≈´zan told police that this incident was one reason for his retirement.„Åì„Çå„ÇÇÂºïÈÄÄ„ÅÆÂãïÊ©ü„ÄçÊó≠È∑≤Â±±„Å∏„ÅÆÊÅêÂñùÊú™ÈÅÇ„ÅßÊö¥ÂäõÂõ£Âì°„ÇâÈÄÆÊçï Yomiuri Shimbun 2007-07-25 He moved into Mongolian politics and in June 2008 was elected to the Mongolian parliament on the opposition Democratic Party ticket. In the 2012 Parliamentary elections, he ran in his native Khovd Province but was not elected. He worked as an advisor on Japan to the Prime Minister of Mongolia Chimediin Saikhanbileg from 2013. He ran for the Democratic Party again in the 2020 Parliamentary elections but was once more unsuccessful. During his active career and since his retirement Kyokush≈´zan has been an active recruiter of Mongolian sumo wrestlers to enter professional sumo, using his connections to help fellow Mongolians interested in joining sumo to find a stable looking to recruit a foreign wrestler. In this regard, he was instrumental in starting the careers of younger sumo wrestlers such as Hakuh≈ç, Tamawashi and M≈çkonami. He estimates he has recruited around 25 Mongolians for professional sumo over the years. ==Personal life== He married in May 2000 to a Mongolian girl who was studying in Japan. The couple have a son and a daughter. ==Career record== ==See also== *List of sumo tournament top division runners-up *List of sumo tournament second division champions *Glossary of sumo terms *List of non-Japanese sumo wrestlers *List of past sumo wrestlers *List of komusubi ==References== ==External links== * Category:1973 births Category:Living people Category:Mongolian sumo wrestlers Category:Komusubi Category:Members of the State Great Khural Category:Democratic Party (Mongolia) politicians Category:Sportspeople from Ulaanbaatar Category:Mongolian sportsperson- politicians Category:Mongolian expatriates in Japan ","title":"Kyokush≈´zan Noboru"},{"id":"9114648","text":"is an anime and visual novel by Longshot told in parallel novel style that follows the events around three women.

The album was produced by Tim Hauser and Janis Siegel. This was the final album made with Laurel Mass√© (due to a car accident in early 1979). For many years this album had the distinction of being the only Manhattan Transfer album not to be released on LP, CD or cassette tape in the U.S. A short-lived Japanese CD was released on October 10, 1987. It was finally issued on CD in the U.S. by Wounded Bird Records in 2005. In the live performances there was a \\"15 minute Intermission\\" at the end of side one, between \\"Speak Up Mambo (Cuentame)\\" (CD track 8) and \\"In the Dark\\" (CD track 9). ==Background== The album was not originally published in the United States, under the catalogue number SD 19218, belonging to the series of Atlantic Records for the U.S. original publications, was used for some local editions, as in Sweden and in Australia. In the U.S. the album was published as an LP in 1979 by Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab in a collector's edition under the name \\"Original Master Recording\\" (discs made from the master original) For many years, ending in 2005, The Manhattan Transfer Live was the only album of the group that was not reissued in the U.S. on CD.

He was convicted of providing abortion, which was illegal in California at the time.District Court of Appeal, Second District Division 3, California. People v. Karman. Cr. 5583.

The coils were inserted into the uterus, where they caused irritation leading to the expulsion of the fetus. The first trial of the super coil method was on Bangladeshi rape victims under the sponsorship of the International Planned Parenthood Federation. These generally resulted in high rates of injury to the patient.James Taranto, \\"Back-Alley Abortion Never Ended\\", The Wall Street Journal, April 18, 2013 One trial of the super coil method took place in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on May 13 and 14, 1972.

Canopus was launched in 1919 by New York Shipbuilding Company, Camden, New Jersey, as the passenger liner SS Santa Leonora for W. R. Grace and Company, but taken over by the U.S. Navy upon completion in July 1919 and commissioned as USS Santa Leonora. She was briefly employed as a trans-Atlantic troop transport before being decommissioned and transferred to the U.S. Army in September 1919. The ship was reacquired by the Navy from the Shipping Board on 22 November 1921. The ship was converted to a submarine tender, and commissioned at Boston on 24 January 1922, with Commander A. S. Wadsworth in command. ==Service history1922-1941=== Canopus reported to Submarine Force, Atlantic Fleet, and remained at Boston until 9 November 1922, when she sailed for further fitting out at Coco Solo, Canal Zone, and San Pedro, California, her base as tender to the submarines of Division 9 until 17 July 1923. Sailing to Pearl Harbor, Canopus tended Submarine Division 17 of the Battle Force with whom she sailed for permanent duty with the Asiatic Fleet in September 1924. Canopus with her squadron of submarines arrived in the Philippines on 4 November 1924. Canopus began her regular schedule of services in Manila Bay, and each summer based with the fleet at Tsingtao, China, with occasional training cruises to various Chinese and Japanese ports, and to the British and French colonies. Between 1927 and 1931, the tender was flagship of submarine divisions, Asiatic Fleet, and later was attached to Submarine Division 10, and was flagship of Submarine Squadron 5. Canopus deployed to China three times in 1937, 1938 and 1939 respectively. ===World War II, 1941-1942=== On 7 December 1941, Canopus, aging but able, lay at Cavite Navy Yard, as tender to Submarine Squadron 20. Her commanding officer was Commander Earl LeRoy Sackett. In the days that followed, her men worked day and night to repair ships damaged in the daily air raids as well as to keep her brood of submarines at sea. With the Army falling back on Manila, Canopus sailed to Mariveles Bay at the tip of Bataan on Christmas Day. On 29 December 1941 she received her first direct bomb hit. A 500-pound armor- piercing bomb penetrated all decks and exploded on the propeller shaft housing. Six sailors were killed mostly from scalding and fires started in the engine rooms and magazines. The six men were buried at sea at 1735 hours in Mariveles Bay at the tip of Bataan. On 1 January 1942 she received a second direct bomb hit. This time a fragmentation bomb which exploded near the top of the smokestack, resulting in substantial damage to the ship and injuries to 16 men of the gun crews. Disguised as a bombed out, listing, abandoned hulk, smoke pots were placed around the ship and gave the appearance of an abandoned hulk by day, while the ship was active at night. Her crew worked and repaired the smaller ships also left behind and keeping the submarines in action. Just before the New Year, the last of the submarines left Canopus. The crew continued to care for small craft and equipment of the Army and Navy, or were attached to the improvised naval battalion which fought on Bataan. The ship's launches were converted into miniature gunboats dubbed Mickey Mouse Battleships, and attacked the Japanese moving south near the shore. Upon the surrender of Bataan on the night of 8‚Äì9 April 1942, Canopus was ordered scuttled in Mariveles Bay, Bataan, to deny her use to the enemy. On 9 April, she was backed off into deep water under her own power and the crew scuttled the ship and abandoned ship. Of the Canopus crew, 221 were evacuated to Corregidor on 28 February 1942 and served with the Marines' 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Battalions on beach defenses. The final 327 crewmen were also evacuated to Corregidor and served in the 4th Marine Regiment's 4th Battalion Reserves (Provisional) which fought during the final battle for the island fortress. Nearly all Canopus crewmen were captured at the fall of Corregidor and spent the rest of the war in Japanese prisoner of war (POW) camps in the Philippines and the Asian mainland. Some of the captured crew did not survive, but were killed on 14 December 1944 in the Palawan massacre. A total of 212 crewmen were declared killed or missing in action. ==Awards== *Combat Action Ribbon *Yangtze Service Medal *China Service Medal *American Defense Service Medal with \\"FLEET\\" clasp *Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal with one battle star *World War II Victory Medal *Philippine Presidential Unit Citation *Philippine Defense Medal ==References== * ==External links== * * On Eternal Patrol USS Canopus Crew list * USS Canopus Association * \\"Captain Sackett's history of USS Canopus (AS-9)\\" *USS Canopus Category:Submarine tenders of the United States Navy Category:World War II shipwrecks in the South China Sea Category:1919 ships Category:Ships built in Camden, New Jersey Category:Maritime incidents in April 1942 Category:Scuttled vessels Category:Shipwrecks of the Philippines Category:Shipwrecks in Manila Bay ","title":"USS Canopus (AS-9)"},{"id":"9114779","text":"Pterocarpus macrocarpus, or the Burma padauk, is a tree native to the seasonal tropical forests of southeastern Asia: in Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, and Vietnam.

Roberto Escalada began his career working on the radio and it was his voice that caught the attention of producers. On meeting him, film producers pleased by his physical appearance immediately put him in as a member of different movie casts. One of his most acclaimed films of the 1940s was Los Pulpos (The Octopuses), a film also directed by Christensen. In 1950 Escalada was chosen to play the central role of a Bioy Casares' short novel that in cinema was named Mr Oribe's crime. Then in 1955 he played a conniving businessman in Ayer fue primavera (Yesterday it was spring) in which he worked under the directorship of Fernando Ayala. However his life changed at the beginning of the 1960s when he got married and start working on TV.

Damariscotta is an old Abenaki word for \\"river of many fishes\\". There are 2,500-year-old oyster shell middens (heaps) along the banks of the Damariscotta River, which occupies a drowned river valley leading to the Gulf of Maine, a large embayment of the Atlantic Ocean. The Damariscotta River begins at the outlet of Damariscotta Lake, at Damariscotta Mills, a village straddling the boundary between the towns of Newcastle and Nobleboro. Damariscotta Lake extends north into the town of Jefferson and is fed from tributaries originating as far north as Washington and Somerville, Maine. From the lake's outlet, the Damariscotta River drops over just through Damariscotta Mills before reaching tidewater, at an arm of the river known as Salt Bay. The tidal Damariscotta flows southward between Newcastle, Edgecomb and Boothbay on the west and Damariscotta, Bristol and South Bristol on the east, reaching the Atlantic Ocean between Linekin Neck on the west and Inner Heron Island on the east. It is a navigable river for nearly its entire length, to the bridge between Newcastle and Nobleboro ().

He aspired to independence in the face of Charles Martel, Duke of the Franks, and the Proven√ßal patrician Abbo. Maurontus appeared in the Chronicle of Fredegar as a dux. He might have been related to the Neustrian mayor of the palace Waratton.Geary, 205. While Maurontus desired to be free from the Pippinid dominance then affecting the rest of Francia, he may have paid homage to the Merovingian kings. Just before his reign are found customs agents of Chilperic II in Marseille, the seat of Maurontus power. Like the other Proven√ßal patricians of his era, his power was primarily personal, relating to the lands and ecclesiastical offices he controlled. For this reason, Maurontus' power was not opposed only by the Pippinids and their allies, but by local families, like that of Waldelenus around Besan√ßon, which controlled the passes of Susa, Gap, and Embrun into Italy. In or before 736, he called in the aid of the Saracens of Yusuf ibn 'Abd al-Rahman al-Fihri, Wali of Narbonne, to garrison Avignon, though some sources indicate that this city was conquered not granted, along with Arles. Other sources place the timing of the event after 736. In that year, Martel invaded the Rhone Valley with his brother Childebrand, and devastated the region, taking Arles and Avignon and confining Maurontus to Marseille. From there, the patrician and his supporters rebelled, but Childebrand and the Lombards decisively defeated them near Avignon and forced Maurontus to go into hiding in the Alps. Maurontus' descendant and namesake was the bishop of Marseille, Maurontus. ==Notes== ==Sources== *Lewis, Archibald R. \\"The Dukes in the Regnum Francorum, A.D. 550-751.\\" Speculum, Vol. 51, No 3 (July 1976), pp 381-410\\\\. *Lewis, Archibald R.

His first stand, on Boston Post Road, was in front of Skinner's Floral shop near the-then Central School (now Town of Mamaroneck offices). He sold cider and apples from an orchard he had purchased on Quaker Ridge. Later, Walter moved south on Post Road, in Shepard's Field (approximately where Richbell Road now meets Post Road). It was here that he began selling his unique brand of hot dogs, blended from beef, pork, and veal, with the wieners split-grilled. At Shepard's Field Walter constructed a cider press to make apple cider. There were blueprints for a stand to be built on an adjacent property on Post Road that would include a residence on the second floor. The property was, however, condemned by the School Board; a junior high school was built in 1926 (now a campus of Mamaroneck High). In 1928 he purchased the property at 937 Palmer Avenue, where his then-new pagoda has been since. The Palmer Avenue building has a pagoda-style copper roof, now oxidized to a light green, and dragon lanterns. It is an example of roadside architecture.

The Hubbard House is significant as the boyhood home of American writer and philosopher Elbert Hubbard. Hubbard lived in Hudson and attended school there, he stayed in the village until he was 16. The original wing of the house was built in 1857 by a doctor from Buffalo, New York, Silas Hubbard. In 1872 the two-story section of the house was constructed in a typical I-house design. The home has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1979. ==History== The east portion of the Hubbard House was constructed in 1857 by Silas Hubbard, a medical doctor who came to McLean County, Illinois, via Buffalo, New York, in 1855. In 1856, Silas Hubbard and Juliana Frances Read had a son, born in Bloomington, Elbert Hubbard would go on to become a major American writer and philosopher.\\"Hubbard House,\\" (PDF), National Register of Historic Places Nomination Form, HAARGIS Database, Illinois Historic Preservation Agency, pp. 1-6. Retrieved 15 June 2007. The Hubbard House was built the year after Elbert was born when the Hubbards moved to Hudson, north of Bloomington. The Hubbards first occupied a farm house on the outskirts of Hudson but occupied the east portion of the Hubbard House, in town, by the next year. Elbert grew up in the house and attended school in the small village of Hudson. Later on in his life his writing would contain many scenes drawn from his boyhood experiences there. Around 1872, at the age of 16, Elbert Hubbard left Hudson for Buffalo and a job as a partner in a soap company where he earned a \\"modest fortune.\\" The same year the additional west portion of the house was constructed.\\"Silas and Elbert Hubbard Home,\\" (PDF), Illinois Historic Sites Survey Inventory, HAARGIS Database, Illinois Historic Preservation Agency, pp. 8-21. Retrieved 15 June 2007. It was in 1892 that Hubbard suddenly gave up the soap industry and decided to become a writer. In 1899 Hubbard published the famous and widely reprinted essay, \\"A Message to Garcia,\\" by 1913 an estimated 40 million copies had been published. Construction on the Hubbard House's two-story front elevation began around 1872 at the urging of Mrs. Hubbard who felt the family had outgrown the small cottage that occupied the site from 1857 until 1872. Despite her desires and Silas Hubbard's prominent position as the only doctor in Hudson, the family had little money with which to pursue the addition to their home. Hubbard was known not to push his clients for payment. In response, Elbert and his mother pored over Silas' records searching for any one they thought might be able to make payment through labor or construction materials. Elbert, already a considerable salesman by 1872, then rode about McLean County to obtain cash, materials and promises of labor from his father's clientele. Soon the new section of the house was completed. ==Architecture== The simple I-house plan of the 1872 addition is plainly visible when the home is viewed from the front. The current Hubbard House is mostly a typical I-house design but the two-story front (west) section of the house was not constructed until 1872. Until that time the Hubbard family was confined to the smaller, one-story portion of the house. Quarters were cramped during this time. The two-story portion of the house features windows on both sides of the front door and three windows on the second-floor, representing the typical I-house design. Sometime after both sections were completed a bay window was added in the angle between the wings. Elbert's room was in the attic, a room which still existed when the building was nominated to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. As the original house became crowded Mrs. Hubbard concocted her own plans and layout for an additional section to be added to the house. Her plan, according to the writings of her daughter Mary, was for a two-story addition at the front elevation of the building, much as the building appears today. She envisioned a central front hall with a stairway flanked by walnut balustrades and an open parlor with folding doors opening into the living room. Mrs. Hubbard's vision for the second floor included two new children's bedrooms and a spare bedroom. In 2008, the original portion of the house was remodeled. This portion of the structure had severe termite damage and the remodeling included reframing all walls, raising the roof, and replacing modern windows with double-hung, 4 over 4 windows that are consistent in size and style with the other windows in the home. The kitchen was also fully remodeled at this time. ==Significance== Silas Hubbard house. Birthplace of Elbert Hubbard.The Hubbard House is significant for its association with American literature as the boyhood home of Elbert Hubbard. Hubbard became one of the most widely known personalities of his era by 1915 and was a widely read and reprinted writer and philosopher. The Hubbard House was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on February 1, 1979. ==Notes== Category:Houses in McLean County, Illinois Category:National Register of Historic Places in McLean County, Illinois Category:I-houses in Illinois Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Illinois Category:1857 establishments in Illinois Category:Homes of American writers ","title":"Hubbard House (Illinois)"},{"id":"9114950","text":"Fight Club: Members Only is a 2006 Indian action film directed by Vikram Chopra and produced by Ravi Walia and Sohail Khan. The film stars Zayed Khan, Sohail Khan, Dino Morea, Ritesh Deshmukh, Aashish Chaudhary, Rahul Dev, Dia Mirza, Amrita Arora and Suniel Shetty in the lead roles while Ashmit Patel, Yash Tonk, Kulbhushan Kharbanda and Neha Dhupia are featured in crucial roles. While the film notably copies the title and logo of the 1999 American film Fight Club, the plot has few parallels or allusions to the American film or the novel on which it is based. ==Plot== The story follows four friends, Vicky (Zayed Khan), Karan (Dino Morea), Somil (Riteish Deshmukh) and Diku (Aashish Chaudhary). The four often attend clubs and drink alcohol together. One night, they witness a physical brawl, and Vicky comes up with the idea of making a \\"Fight Club,\\" in which the participants will be allowed to fight physically but with valid reason. The night when the Fight Club is opened, Somil comes to know that his uncle, who brought him up and currently lives in Delhi, has met some troubles. Some local gangsters want to take over the club of Somil's uncle to use it for drugs smuggling. After being firmly rejected, they threatened to kill him. Somil then leaves for Delhi to help his uncle, leaving the other 3 boys running the Fight Club in Mumbai. When Mohit (Yash Tonk), a college youngster, enters the club and takes part in a fight, he ends up beating his opponent severely to critical condition. After being stopped by Vicky, Mohit attacks him, to which response Vicky throws him out of the club. The scene is caught by several police officers, they arrest Mohit and seals the Fight Club, but others manage to escape and select a new place to keep running the Fight Club. After Mohit is released, he arrives with his gangster friends to get revenge, but is rejected by the latter. Anna (Sunil Shetty), Mohit's older brother, is released from prison where he stayed for 8 years and visits Mohit to see if he has changed himself from keeping fighting and working for gangsters, Anna tells Mohit that the reason he quit the gangster group and handed himself to the police was that he wanted to set a good example for Mohit. He then takes Mohit to Delhi for vacation. Vicky, Karan and Diku keep running the Fight Club. One night, Vicky's past classmate Sameer (Sohail Khan) shows up in the club to challenge Vicky. Sameer almost beats Vicky, but police arrives in the scene, making all of them escape. The new place is sealed again by police, and the 3 friends decide to give it up and go to Delhi to visit Somil. Somil's uncle was killed by gangsters before the 3 arrive. The 4 then take over Somil's Uncle's club Crossroads to reopen it, but the gangsters almost destroy it again in the first night after its reopening. The 4 then decide to hire a bouncer to protect their club from being destroyed again, and Vicky comes up with the idea of hiring Sameer. Sameer rejects at first, but later shows up when the 4 are fighting with the gangster group and saves them and joined them in running the club. While staying in Delhi, Mohit cheats Anna by telling him that he will go back to Mumbai to attend college but instead going to meet Anna's old gangster friends Sandy (Rahul Dev) and Dinesh (Ashmit Patel), who killed Somil's uncle. Anna coincidentally meets Sandy and Dinesh, the two then invite Anna to come back to their gangster group again but are rejected by Anna. Dinesh comes up with idea to get Anna back. Mohit meets Diku, making him aware that the 4 of them are also in Delhi. Dinesh takes Mohit to Crossroads to revenge, but lets Mohit get in alone. When Mohit is beaten by the 5 of them, Dinesh doesn't help or even show up, Moreover, he kills Mohit soon after he's beaten , making Vicky and his friends naturally blamed, The 5 of them are all arrested with murder charge but are soon bailed by Vicky's father, in exchange, Vicky agrees with his father to go back to Mumbai with him, Soon enough, Anna finds out about this incident, and plans to avenge Mohit with his whole crew. Vicky develops a romantic relationship with Anu (Dia Mirza), Karan's younger sister, and Karan falls in love with his neighbour Sonali (Amrita Arora). As the friends get a phone call they realize that Anna has captured Somil and Dikku. Karan and Sameer rush to save them, but beaten in a fight with Sandy and Dinesh. Vicky then arrives to help his friends and also gets knocked down. Somil then realizes that Dinesh was the one who killed Mohit with a small screwdriver when Dinesh tries to kill Somil with the same weapon, but Anna saves Somil and kills Dinesh. Sandy is left devastated as Anna, Vicky, Sameer, Somil, Karan and Dikku go back to the bar. Ultimately, Anna befriends the five and the Crossroads club is converted into a regular nightclub. ==Cast== *Suniel Shetty as Anna *Sohail Khan as Sameer Kapoor *Dino Morea as Karan Chopra *Ritesh Deshmukh as Somil Sharma * Aashish Chaudhary as Dikku *Zayed Khan as Vicky Khanna *Dia Mirza as Anu Chopra *Amrita Arora as Sonali Malhotra *Rahul Dev as Sandy *Ashmit Patel as Dinesh *Aseem Agrawal as Blondy Singh *Yash Tonk as Mohit * Neha Dhupia as Komal * Kulbhushan Kharbanda as Suhas Sharma * Kamal Chopra as Mr. Khanna * Puneet Vasishtha as Sapru * Murli Sharma as Police Inspector * Vikrant Anand As Fighter * Vivek V.

J-storThe Oxford Dictionary of National Biography record gives his birth and death information as (1575?‚Äì1627/8). was a physician in England and author of books and other texts on medicine and witchcraft. ==Life== He was a native of Coventry, and his mother is believed to be Susannah Winthrop, aunt of John Winthrop. In 1590 he was admitted a scholar of Trinity College, Cambridge, and five years later, after taking the B.A. degree, he moved to Corpus Christi College where, in the following year, he proceeded to the M.A. degree. He obtained the M.D. degree in 1603, and then took up residence at Northampton, where, through the patronage and influence of Sir William Tate, he acquired a considerable professional practice. ==Works== Cotta wrote extensively about quack doctors, and exposed several in his book Ignorant Practisers of Physicke (1612). He put a traditional Galenist argument, to the effect that experience alone of was of limited value to medical practitioners.Todd Howard James Pettigrew, Shakespeare and the Practice of Physic: medical narratives on the early modern English stage (2007), p. 35; Google Books. With his medical colleague James Hart from Northampton, he argued the case for learned medicine (the early modern tradition descending from Galen) and the requirement of a university degree for its effective use.Don Bates, Knowledge and the Scholarly Medical Traditions (1995), p. 162; Google Books. He believed in evil spirits, sorcerers and magic. He begins his book The Triall of Witch-craft (1616) by stating that these phenomena were beyond human knowledge, and that only by conjecture and inference is it possible to understand these events. He did warn readers that many suspected witches were really imposters, or unwitting agents of the devil. He presents as evidence that evil spirits exist the standard classical history and biblical texts. He even uses reason to dismiss the \\"water test\\" for witches, where a purported witch would be submerged in water, and if she had renounced her baptism and was a true witch, the water would reject her and she would float. Cotta did still agree with others like Reginald Scot that magic was clearly a factor in day-to-day life because many diseases displayed symptoms they could not understand, or did not respond to standard remedies. Also he asserted that eyewitness accounts were sufficient to charge a suspected witch with witchcraft.Chapter 6, Witch-hunting, Harold V.

(2001) The Quest for the Origins of Vedic Culture: The Indo-Aryan Migration Debate Oxford University Press, .Afghanistan: ancient Ariana (1950), Information Bureau, p3. Ancient Eastern Iranian languages may have been spoken in the region around the time of the rise of Zoroastrianism. By the middle of the 6th century BCE, the Achaemenids overthrew the Medes and incorporated Arachosia, Aria, and Bactria within its eastern boundaries. An inscription on the tombstone of Darius I of Persia mentions the Kabul Valley in a list of the 29 countries that he had conquered. Before the arrival of Islam Southern Afghanistan used to be a stronghold of Zoroastrianism. It is believed that the Avesta had arrived in Persia through Arachosia. Thus the region is also considered as a \\"second fatherland for Zoroastrianism\\".The idea of Iran. An essay on its origin, Gnoli Gherardo, page 133 Following Alexander the Great's conquest and occupation in the 4th century BC, the successor-state Seleucid Empire controlled the area until 305 BC when they gave much of it to the Indian Maurya Empire as part of an alliance treaty. The Mauryans brought Buddhism from India and controlled parts of southern and eastern Afghanistan until about 185 BC when they were overthrown. In the 7th century, the Umayyad Arab Muslims entered into the area now known as Afghanistan after decisively defeating the Sassanians in the Battle of Nihawand (642 AD). Following this colossal defeat, the last Sassanid Emperor, Yazdegerd III, became a hunted fugitive and fled eastward deep into Central Asia. In pursuing Yazdegerd, the Arabs chose to enter the area from north- eastern IranArabic As a Minority Language, by Jonathan Owens, pg. 181 and thereafter into Herat, where they stationed a large portion of their army before advancing toward the rest of Afghanistan. The Arabs exerted considerable efforts toward propagating Islam amongst the locals. A large number of the inhabitants of the region of northern Afghanistan accepted Islam through Umayyad missionary efforts, particularly under the reigns of Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik (caliph from 723 to 733) and Umar ibn AbdulAziz (caliph from 717 to 720).The Preaching of Islam: A History of the Propagation of the Muslim Faith, by Thomas Walker Arnold, pg. 183 During the reign of Al-Mu'tasim Islam was generally practiced amongst most inhabitants of the region and finally under Ya'qub-i Laith Saffari, Islam was by far, the predominant religion of Kabul along with other major cities of Afghanistan. Later, the Samanids propagated Islam deep into the heart of Central Asia, as the first complete translation of the Qur'an into Persian occurred in the 9th century. Since the 9th century, Islam has dominated the country's religious landscape. Islamic leaders have entered the political sphere at various times of crisis, but rarely exercised secular authority for long. Remnants of the Hindu Shahi dynasty in Afghanistan's eastern borders were expelled by Mahmud of Ghazni during 998 and 1030. Until the 1890s, the country's Nuristan region was known as Kafiristan (land of the kafirs or \\"infidels\\") because of its inhabitants: the Nuristani, an ethnically distinctive people who practiced animism, polytheism and shamanism. praying at the Blue Mosque (or Shrine of Ali) in the northern Afghan city of Mazar-i-Sharif The 1979 Soviet invasion in support of a communist government triggered a major intervention of religion into Afghan political conflict, and Islam united the multi-ethnic political opposition. Once the Soviet-backed Marxist-style regime came to power in Afghanistan, the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) moved to reduce the influence of Islam. The \\"atheistic\\" and \\"infidel\\" communist PDPA imprisoned, tortured and murdered many members of the religious establishment. After National Reconciliation talks in 1987, Islam became once again the state religion and the country removed the word \\"Democratic\\" from its official name. From 1987-1992, the country's official name was the Republic of Afghanistan but today it is an Islamic Republic. For Afghans, Islam represents a potentially unifying symbolic system which offsets the divisiveness that frequently rises from the existence of a deep pride in tribal loyalties and an abounding sense of personal and family honor found in multitribal and multiethnic societies such as Afghanistan. Mosques serve not only as places of worship, but for a multitude of functions, including shelter for guests, places to meet and converse, the focus of social religious festivities and schools. Almost every Afghan has at one time during his youth studied at a mosque school; for some this is the only formal education they receive. ==Minority religious groupsShia Islam=== The Shias make up between 7% to 20% of the total population of Afghanistan. Although there is a tiny minority Sunnis among them, the Hazaras are predominately and overwhelmngy Shia, mostly of the Twelver branch with some smaller groups who practice the Ismailism branch.1911 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica - Hazara (Race) The Qizilbash Tajiks of Afghanistan have traditionally been Shias. ===Modernist and Nondenominational Muslims=== One of the most important revivalists and resuscitators of the Islamic Modernist and non-denominational Muslim movement in the contemporary era was Jamal ad-Din al-Afghani. ===Zoroastrians=== According to the World Christian Encyclopedia, 2,000 Afghans identified as Zoroastrians in 1970.http://www.vanderbilt.edu/AnS/religious_studies/CDC/afghanistan.html. ===Dharmic religions=== There are about 1,000 Afghan Sikhs and a little over 1,000 Hindus living in different cities but mostly in Kabul, Jalalabad, and Ghazni.

It stands on Carrigadaggan Hill, at Carrigbyrne in County Wexford at , just off the N25 national route between the towns of Wexford and New Ross. It is modelled on Pompey's Pillar, an early 4th-century victory column dedicated in Alexandria in Roman Egypt to the Roman emperor Diocletian (). ==History== The Browne-Clayton Monument is the only internally accessible Corinthian column in existence and is thus a unique architectural landmark. It was built of Mount Leinster granite and contains an internal staircase leading to the capital, from which an impressive view of the surrounding countryside can be obtained. Its construction commenced in 1839 and was completed in 1841. The design replicates the monument known as Pompey's Pillar in Alexandria, Egypt, which is approximately six feet lower in height. The Monument was designed by the renowned English architect, Thomas Cobden, who is most famous for the design of the Gothic Revival style Cathedral of the Assumption in Carlow Town as well as the Duckett's Grove near Tullow, County Carlow. The monument was built by General Robert Browne-Clayton of Carrigbyrne in commemoration of Sir Ralph Abercromby, who was his commanding officer with whom he fought and was victorious in the Egyptian battles in 1801 against Napoleon during the French campaign in Egypt and Syria. It was at the Battle of Alexandria that Abercromby was mortally wounded. The local name for it is \\"Browne's Nonsense\\" as legend has it that Browne originally built it in memory of his son, thought to have been killed in battle, but who turned up alive and well shortly after completion of the pillar. These events have given the column international historical significance and created huge international interest in the restoration project. ==Lightning strike== On 29 December 1994, the Column was struck by lightning and considerable damage was caused to the capital and the top 1/3 of the column, in which a large gaping hole was made. The internal stairway was blocked by falling rock and debris. Wexford Monument Trust Ltd. was formed as a limited company in December, 2001, with the objectives of acquiring, restoring and repairing the Browne-Clayton Monument. The Trust consists of representatives from the Wexford County Council, the World Monuments Fund in Britain, and An Taisce. ==Restoration== The restoration commenced with the drawing up of a conservation report in July 2002. This recommended that the repairs be done in two phases. The emergency phase 1 was completed in November 2002. It consisted of making a temporary access route to the column, strengthening of the column with supporting scaffolding, and the removal of the capital and almost one third of the shaft. Phase 2 ‚Äì the completion phase ‚Äì commenced in July 2003. This consisted of stone masonry work to either replace or repair damaged stone. The re-assembly of the shaft and capital and was completed in November 2003. ==Financial support== The restoration has been successful and could not have been done without the generous funding from Wexford County Council, the World Monuments Fund in Britain, The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the Heritage Council, An Taisce and private donors. Access: As part of the restoration direct access along a dedicated pathway from the public road was acquired. The lands on which the Monument is situated are also in the ownership of the Trust. This involved the purchase of the land on which the Monument is situated as well as a pathway leading from the public road to this land. ==Interesting facts== * Total number of sections: 78 * Number of sections of the capital: 9 * Weight of repaired capital: 32 tonnes * Weight of each shaft section (ashlar and rubble): 3.5 tonnes ==References== ==External links== * Browne Clayton Memorial on wexford.ie Category:Monuments and memorials in the Republic of Ireland Category:Buildings and structures in County Wexford Category:Monumental columns in the Republic of Ireland ","title":"Browne-Clayton Monument"},{"id":"9115044","text":"Miyabiyama Tetsushi (born July 28, 1977 as Masato Takeuchi) is a former sumo wrestler from Mito, Ibaraki, Japan. A former amateur champion, he turned professional in 1998. With the exception of two tournaments, he was ranked in the top division of professional sumo from 1999 until the end of his career in 2013, holding the second highest rank of ≈çzeki from 2000 to 2001. He won eight special prizes and was runner-up in four top division tournaments. He wrestled for Fujishima stable (formerly Musashigawa stable), where he worked as a coach until opening his own Futagoyama stable. ==Early career== Miyabiyama competed in amateur sumo tournaments while at Meiji University, but left before graduation to join the professional ranks. He was accepted by Musashigawa stable in July 1998 and given makushita tsukedashi status, meaning he could begin at the bottom of the third highest makushita division. He quickly worked his way through the ranks, logging in four consecutive championships, two in makushita and two in j≈´ry≈ç to reach the top makuuchi division in March 1999 just eight months after entering professional sumo. His rise to the middle ranks of makuuchi was so quick that he did not yet have a topknot, a true rarity and one that did not go unnoticed by announcers. He won a fighting spirit prize in his first top division tournament, and was promoted to komusubi in January 2000. In that tournament he delivered an impressive 12‚Äì3 record, finishing as runner up to stablemate Mus≈çyama. He followed that up with two 11‚Äì4 marks at sekiwake rank in March and May 2000. After that tournament he was promoted to sumo's second highest rank of ≈çzeki. He had made the rank only 12 tournaments after his professional debut, tying for the record with Yutakayama (another amateur champion) and Haguroyama. ==≈åzeki== Miyabiyama's promotion was controversial. The Sumo Association's decision was not unanimous, with three of the ten directors present at the meeting voting against the promotion. Sakaigawa-oyakata (former yokozuna Sadanoyama), in particular, was reported to have felt it was too soon as Miyabiyama had only been in makuuchi for just over a year, and had not yet won a top division title. In the end the doubters were proved correct as Miyabiyama lasted just eight tournaments in the rank, never scoring more than 9 wins, before being demoted in the wake of two consecutive losing records. He was one of the most short-lived ≈çzeki on record (not counting wrestlers who have quickly been promoted to yokozuna). ==Later career== Miyabiyama in May 2009. Miyabiyama sat out the two tournaments following his demotion with an injury, and so had to start all over again from the maegashira ranks. In January 2003 he looked to have earned his first ever kinboshi or gold star and to have defeated yokozuna Takanohana for the first time in eleven attempts with a rare counter-attacking nichonage throw but although the referee declared him the winner the judges ordered a rematch, which he lost. (The Sumo Association was inundated with calls of protest from the public as a result.) He produced the occasional strong tournament, finishing as runner-up in July 2004, and he held a san'yaku rank several times, but he was unable to go further and continued to move up and down the banzuke. It was not until mid-2006 that Miyabiyama was able to make his first sustained challenge for promotion to ≈çzeki since his demotion five years previously. In May at sekiwake rank he produced a superb 14‚Äì1 record, only losing the championship on the last day in a playoff to then- ≈çzeki Hakuh≈ç. There was speculation that another strong performance in July 2006 would see him return to ≈çzeki, but he got off to a poor start, winning only three bouts in the first seven days, and though he recovered somewhat to post a 10‚Äì5 score, it was not considered good enough. He was only the second wrestler after Kotogahama in 1957 to post more than 33 wins in three tournaments in san'yaku and not get promoted to ≈çzeki. He could score only 9‚Äì6 and 8‚Äì7 in the next two basho and in January 2007 his run of five tournaments at sekiwake came to an end when he could only manage a 5‚Äì10 record. In March 2007 Miyabiyama finally earned his first gold star by defeating yokozuna Asash≈çry≈´ on the second day. He had defeated yokozuna on four previous occasions ‚Äì Akebono in January 2000, Akebono and Wakanohana in March 2000 and Asashoryu himself in September 2004, but each time had been ranked in sanyaku and was not eligible for a kinboshi. The victory was all the more surprising as prior to this bout Miyabiyama had lost thirteen in a row to Asash≈çry≈´. However, on the 7th day he picked up a hamstring injury and had to withdraw from the tournament. He returned with a comfortable 9‚Äì6 mark in May, and remained in the upper maegashira ranks, defeating Asash≈çry≈´ again in September 2008. In May 2009 he slipped to maegashira 11, his lowest ever top division ranking, but he responded with two consecutive winning records, the first time he had achieved this since 2006. In November 2009 he was runner-up alongside Tochinoshin on 12‚Äì3 and shared the Fighting Spirit award. He was suspended along with over a dozen other wrestlers from the July 2010 tournament after admitting involvement in illegal betting on baseball. As a result, he became the first former ≈çzeki since Daiju in 1977 to be demoted to the j≈´ry≈ç division. This broke a run of 69 consecutive tournaments ranked in makuuchi. However, he had no problem in securing a return to the top division (the first ex-≈çzeki ever to do so), scoring 12‚Äì3 at the rank of j≈´ry≈ç 2. In January 2012 he was ranked at komusubi, the first time in 29 tournaments that he had made the san'yaku ranks. However, he won only 33 out of a possible 90 bouts in that year (15 of those with the hatakikomi technique), and by January 2013 had fallen to the bottom makuuchi rank of maegashira 16. He won only three bouts in that tournament and was demoted to j≈´ry≈ç in March 2013, where he again only managed three wins and quickly announced his retirement on the last day of the tournament. ==Retirement from sumo== Miyabiyama in training in 2011. Miyabiyama fought in the top division for 82 tournaments in total, which is second best among makushita tsukedashi entrants and the eleventh best overall in sumo history. The 68 tournaments he fought after dropping from the ≈çzeki rank is also a record. He was the last active wrestler who had begun his career at makushita 60 (the bottom of the division); makushita tsukedeshi entrants now start at makushita 15. Upon retirement he recalled his most memorable bout as being the first day of his comeback tournament in March 2002, having fallen from ≈çzeki and missed the previous two tournaments through injury. Miyabiyama stayed in sumo as a coach at his stable under the elder name of Futagoyama Oyakata. His danpatsu-shiki, or official retirement ceremony, was held at the Ry≈çgoku Kokugikan on February 1, 2014 with around 8,000 in attendance and 270 guests taking part in the hair-cutting before his topknot was removed by his former stablemate Mus≈çyama, now Fujishima Oyakata. After the ceremony he said he wanted to help develop strong Japanese wrestlers. In addition to coaching duties Futagoyama is also a quasi- independent councilor (Hyojjin) in the Sumo Association's hierarchy. In 2015 he launched his own yakiniku restaurant, Miyabiyama, in Edogawa, Tokyo. In March 2018 he was given permission to branch out from Fujishima stable, and he opened up his own Futagoyama stable in Tokorozawa, Saitama on April 1. ==Fighting style== Roh≈ç in May 2007. Miyabiyama specialised in pushing and thrusting techniques, with about a third of his wins being a simple push-out, or oshi-dashi. In later years he relied more heavily on pull downs or slap downs, hiki otoshi and hatakikomi. Like most oshi specialists, he was at a disadvantage if his opponents managed to grab hold of his mawashi or belt. At , he was the heaviest man in the top division from the retirement of his stablemate Musashimaru in November 2003, until the arrival of the (now retired) Yamamotoyama in 2009. ==Family== Miyabiyama was married in 2008 to a 24-year-old former office worker from Kurume, Fukuoka, and their wedding reception was held in June 2009 with 450 guests including his stablemaster Musashigawa Oyakata attending. In June 2013 his second eldest son died. In February 2014 his eldest son, then aged four, was Miyabiyama's final opponent in a bout at his retirement ceremony. ==Career record== ==See also== *Glossary of sumo terms *List of sumo tournament top division runners-up *List of sumo tournament second division champions *List of past sumo wrestlers *List of sumo elders *List of ≈çzeki ==References== ==External links== * Category:1977 births Category:Living people Category:Japanese sumo wrestlers Category:≈åzeki Category:People from Mito, Ibaraki Category:Sumo people from Ibaraki Prefecture ","title":"Miyabiyama Tetsushi"},{"id":"9115076","text":"90 Pound Suburban Housewife (Driving in Her SUV) was the song that became the anthem of fossil fuel conscious environmentalists in 2006.

He is married to Lady Meriel Darby, daughter of the former Prime Minister, Alec Douglas-Home, 14th Earl of Home, who was a frequent visitor to the Court. ==History== The manor was granted by King Henry III to Sir Robert de Musgrove (or Mucegros) in 1240. Since that time, apart from the brief period 1918-1949, it has remained in the possession of his descendants and relatives, passing through the families of Musgrove, Beauchamp, Lygon of Madresfield, Parsons-Hopton and Darby. The current owner is 24th in direct descent from Sir Robert de Musgrove. A notable 15th century owner was John Beauchamp, 1st Baron Beauchamp of Powick, Lord High Treasurer of England. ==References== * Lees-Milne, J. (1985).

He was active in the National Union of Tailors and Garment Workers and was elected to the Union's National Executive. He moved to London to live in Finsbury where he became active in local politics as a member of the Labour Party; in 1949 he was elected to Finsbury Borough Council from West Finsbury ward, at the top of the poll in a six-member ward. On the last day of 1952 he formally adopted the first name 'Michael' by deed poll. ==Municipal experience== After local ward boundary changes, Cliffe was elected in Central ward from 1953, but then was elected an Alderman (his wife Sophia, n√©e Whitesman, followed him onto the council); he remained an Alderman until his death. He was chairman of the Housing Committee, and when the building work was completed he was allocated a flat in the Golden Lane Estate. He was chosen as Mayor of Finsbury for the year 1956-1957 and was then Chairman of the Policy and Resources Committee (the unofficial Leader of the Council). ==Byelection== As Chairman of Shoreditch and Finsbury Constituency Labour Party when the local Member of Parliament Victor Collins took a life peerage in the first appointments in 1958, Cliffe was selected as his successor as Labour candidate for the constituency of Shoreditch and Finsbury. Despite a rumbustious campaign in which the police had to be called to one of his meetings and arrested four men, Cliffe comfortably retained the seat on a low turnout in the byelection. ==Parliamentary life== A quiet and rare speaker in the House of Commons, Cliffe was active in supporting his constituents. He joined a delegation to the Home Secretary from the Street Bookmakers' Federation in 1960, saying he wanted to be better informed of their views in advance of the debate on a Gambling Bill. He was Chairman of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising Memorial Committee and in 1961 called attention to increasing votes for fascist candidates, declaring \\"anything that spells Fascism must be rooted out and destroyed\\". When tension grew over the Berlin Wall in 1961, Cliffe was one of four Labour MPs who demanded the recall of Parliament, and later wrote a letter to President Kennedy and Nikita Khrushchev urging hasty negotiations and a moratorium on nuclear testing. He had been intending to continue his Parliamentary career, but was taken ill and died in St Bartholomew's Hospital in August 1964, aged 61.

The name derives from Greek Œ≥ŒπŒ±ŒªœåœÇ (shore) and Turkish ova (lowland), i.e. \\"lowland shore\\". ==Topography== Kalamari Katarakt Waterfall near Gialova, Greece The village is in two parts. The beach/port part of the village consists of two short streets, one fronting the Bay and the other at right angles to it, leading to the main Pylos- Kiparissia road. This part is largely touristic - bars and restaurants, shops, and the one hotel. Where the two streets meet there is a mole used by local fishing boats (and for car parking). The other, residential and commercial part of the village is about 1km further north along the Pylos-Kiparissia road. The modern development of Gialova also includes several houses and holiday villas on the hill behind Gialova, called Dapia (Greek: ŒùœÑŒ¨œÄŒπŒ±). ==Population== The area of Gialova was first settled at the beginning of the twentieth century.Gialova - Tourist Guide 2013 In 1928 there were 49 inhabitants.

Today the main industry is small-scale tourism. There are two campsites, a hotel, restaurants, cafes, shops, villas, apartments and rooms to rent. ==Beaches and lagoon== In addition to the village beach to the south of the mole, a 1.5 kilometre long sandy beach, signposted \\"Golden Beach\\" but known as Divari (Greek: Œ¥ŒπŒ≤Œ¨œÅŒπ meaning \\"hatchery\\") to local people, starts at Gialova and continues west to Old Navarino castle.

At the time of his arrest, Seale worked at a lumber plant in Roxie, Mississippi. He also worked as a crop duster and was a police officer in Louisiana briefly in the 1970s.\\"Town of Ferriday\\" He was a member of the militant Klan organization known as the Silver Dollar Group,Frank Morris Murder: James Ford Seale: A sheriff's election, nine deaths and a silver dollar whose members were identified with a silver dollar; occasionally minted the year of the member's birth.Frank Morris Murder: SDG formed just weeks before Edwards murder in '64 Seale was convicted on June 14, 2007 by a federal jury on one count of conspiracy to kidnap two persons, and two counts of kidnapping where the victims were not released unharmed. He was sentenced on August 24, 2007, to three life terms for his part in the 1964 murders of the two Mississippi teens. In 2008, Seale's kidnapping conviction was overturned by a panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, before being reinstated by that court sitting en banc the following year. He was incarcerated at the Federal Correctional Institution (FCI) in Terre Haute, Indiana, where he died in 2011. ==Background== Southern Mississippi was an active area of the civil rights movement in the 1960s. Many working class whites feared greater job competition from blacks if integration changed the society and tensions were high over desegregation of schools. The Natchez area became a center of Ku Klux Klan and other segregationist activity, with violence directed against black churches, often used as the center of community organizing, and black activists. Seale's brother Jack and his father Clyde were also members of the Silver Dollar Group. == Double murder in 1964 == James Ford Seale abducted the two young African-American men, Henry Hezekiah Dee and Charles Eddie Moore, each 19, as they were hitchhiking near Roxie on May 2, 1964. Moore had been a student at Alcorn State College. According to F.B.I. records, Seale thought the two might be civil rights activists, especially as Dee had just returned from Chicago. He ordered them into his car by telling them he was a federal revenue agent, investigating moonshine stills. He drove them into the Homochitto National Forest between Meadville and Natchez, having called Charles Marcus Edwards to have him and other Klansmen follow. As Seale held a sawed-off shotgun on the pair, the other men tied the young men to a tree and severely beat them with long, skinny sticks (called \\"bean sticks\\" because they're often used to \\"stalk\\" beans in gardens). According to the January 2007 indictment, the Klansmen took the pair, who were reportedly still alive, to a nearby farm where Seale duct- taped their mouths and hands. The Klansmen wrapped the bloody pair in a plastic tarp, put them into the trunk of another Klansman's red Ford (the deceased Ernest Parker, according to FBI records), and drove almost 100 miles to the Ole River near Tallulah, Louisiana. They had to drive through Louisiana to get there, but the backwater is located in Warren County, Mississippi. At the river, the Klansmen took the pair away from shore in a boat, where they tied them to an old Jeep engine block and sections of railroad track rails with chains before dumping them in the water to drown. Reportedly still alive when put in the river, the young men were killed in Mississippi.http://talk.workunlimited.co.uk/uslatest/story/0,,-6371401,00.html According to a Klan informant, Seale said later that he would have shot them first, but didn't want to get blood all over the boat. The bodies of the pair were found about two months later by US Navy divers who were working on the investigation associated with the disappearance in June of three civil rights workers: Michael Schwerner and Andrew Goodman; both from New York City and James Chaney from Meridian, Mississippi. The FBI made an investigation of the Dee-Moore murders (they had more than 100 agents around Natchez, trying to reduce violence), and presented their findings to local District Attorney Lenox Forman. FBI agents and Mississippi Highway Patrol officers arrested Seale, then 29, and fellow Klansman Charles Marcus Edwards, 31, on November 6, 1964. According to FBI informants, both men confessed to the crime. They were released on November 11, after family members posted $5,000 bond each. On January 11, 1965, the District Attorney Lenox Forman filed a \\"motion to dismiss affidavits\\" with Justice of the Peace Willie Bedford, who signed the motion the same day. The motions state: \\"‚Ä¶ that in the interest of justice and in order to fully develop the facts in this case, the affidavits against James Seale and Charles Edwards should be dismissed by this Court without prejudice to the Defendants or to the State of Mississippi at this time in order that the investigation may be continued and completed for presentation to a Grand Jury at some later date.\\" Forman said he dismissed the case because it had been prejudiced toward the defendants, who \\"put out the story\\" in Meadville that, after their arrest, they had been \\"brutally mistreated,\\" as reported in 2005 in an investigation by Donna Ladd of the Jackson Free Press. == 1966 Congressional hearing == On January 14, 1966, Seale was called to appear in Washington before a subcommittee of the House Committee on Un-American Activities, which was investigating Klan activities. Seale was there with nine other alleged Klansmen from the violent White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, including his father, Clyde Seale, and Charles Marcus Edwards, his alleged accomplice in the Dee-Moore murders. The Klansmen repeatedly pleaded the Fifth Amendment, while the chief investigator Donald T. Appell and House members placed into the record what they believed the men had done, including kidnapping and murdering Dee and Moore in 1964. According to the hearing transcript, Appell introduced testimony of Alton Alford, a Meadville man, who said that Seale beat him with his shotgun. Appell asked Seale if he was involved in the 1965 death of a Klansman named Earl Hodges, who had fallen out with Seale's father. Appell accused Seale and Edwards of claiming \\"false arrest\\" by Mississippi highway patrolmen to help them escape criminal charges. Two authors published books on the case: Don Whitehead wrote Attack on Terror: The FBI Against the Ku Klux Klan in Mississippi, (1990), which included some of the FBI's 1960s-era findings on the Dee-Moore murders. Earl Ofari Hutchinson, in Betrayed: The Presidential Failure to Protect Black Lives, (1996), also wrote about the Dee-Moore case, naming Seale and another suspect as responsible. He called for federal officials to indict the men on kidnapping charges. Hutchinson pointed out that because the crime occurred in a national forest, the federal government has jurisdiction. == Possible involvement in the assassination of Wharlest Jackson == Seale, a member of the Silver Dollar Group, was one of the suspects in the carbombing assassination of civil rights activist Wharlest Jackson in Natchez that took place in 1967. Jackson was a member of the NAACP chapter in Natchez. The Silver Dollar Group was a militant Klan organization founded by Raleigh Jackson \\"Red\\" Glover. Glover was the main suspect in the Wharlest Jackson case. The Silver Dollar group is also suspected of a failed attempt to assassinate Natchez NAACP chapter president George Metcalfe by carbombing. == Reopening of the case in 2005 == In 1998 Thomas Moore, the older brother of Charles and a retired 30-year Army veteran, began to work on the case. Then living in Colorado, he wrote to District Attorney Ronnie Harper \\"asking him to look into his brother's murder. He agreed.\\" Various media journalists began to look at the story again, including Newsday, 20-20 and investigative reporter Jerry Mitchell of The Clarion-Ledger (Jackson, Mississippi). On January 14, 2000, Mitchell reported that the murders occurred on federal land. This spurred the FBI to take another look, as the location gave them jurisdiction, but some of their resources got diverted to the revival of the investigation of Edgar Ray Killen in the 1964 Neshoba County murders. Moore was contacted by the filmmaker David Ridgen of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. Together they went to Mississippi on July 7, 2005, to begin shooting the documentary Mississippi Cold Case, about the events of Moore's brother's murder. Together they began a search for justice in the case. They had also arranged to work with journalist Donna Ladd and photographer Kate Medley from the Jackson Free Press, an alternative newsweekly in Jackson, Mississippi. On July 8 the two men interviewed the District Attorney Ronnie Harper, who told them that James Ford Seale was alive. Seale's family members had reported him dead to the media a few years before. The pair confirmed this fact when Kenny Byrd, a resident of Roxie, pointed them toward Seale's trailer. The same morning, Moore and Ridgen met with Ladd and Medley. During this trip, the former Klansman James Kenneth Greer told Ladd and Medley that Seale was living in Roxie, Mississippi next to his brother. The discovery of Seale helped to revive interest in the case; Moore and Ridgen visited the U.S. Attorney Dunn Lampton, who pledged to re-open the case. Two weeks after the trip, Ladd published the first of several articles in the Jackson Free Press about the investigation and the discovery that Seale was alive. Moved by the response of people he talked to about the case, in July Thomas Moore formed the \\"Dee Moore Coalition for Justice in Franklin County.\\" Moore and Ridgen returned to Mississippi every few months to continue filming, making nine trips in total. Each time they visited Dunn Lampton, where Moore presented more of the data they had found. The Jackson Free Press continued its investigation as well, and has published a package of all of its stories on the case to keep local interest high. At the end of July 2005, the paper published Thomas Moore's response to an editorial that appeared in the Franklin Advocate, the weekly in Meadville, in which the editor said the case should not be re-opened. (Editor Mary Lou Webb of the Advocate did not publish Moore's response.) == Indictment, trial and conviction in 2007 == The indictment affidavit filed January 24, 2007, in U.S. District Court in Jackson, charged Seale with two counts of kidnapping and one count of conspiracy. The \\"introductory allegations\\" begin: > The White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan (WKKKK) operated in the Southern > District of Mississippi and elsewhere, and was a secret organization of > adult white males who, among other things, targeted for violence African > Americans they believed were involved in civil rights activity in order to > intimidate and retaliate against such individuals. The document says that Seale and other Klan members suspected Dee of being involved with civil rights activity. Moore was included in the abduction and murder because he was a friend of Dee. Seale was arraigned and denied bond because he was considered a flight risk: he owned no property, was a pilot, and lived in a motor home. He and his wife had already left Roxie for a brief time after the reporting team's initial July 2005 visits, according to Roxie residents. Primary testimony was from fellow Klansman Charles Marcus Edwards. After he was confronted by Thomas Moore and David Ridgen during filming of a scene in Mississippi Cold Case, state and federal officials gave him immunity from prosecution to tell the full story of what happened. Seale was convicted of kidnapping and conspiracy on June 14, 2007, by a federal jury. On August 24, 2007, Seale was sentenced to serve three life terms for his crimes.Twitter / Breaking News Alerts: AP: James Ford Seale, a for Twitter / Breaking News Alerts: Reputed Klansman James Ford Judge Wingate said that he took into account Seale's advanced age and poor health, but added, \\"Then I had to take a look at the crime itself, the horror, the ghastliness of it.\\" Seale was imprisoned for a year at a medical facility. Seale's conviction was overturned on September 9, 2008 by the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals. The court ruled that the lower court had failed to recognize the statute of limitations for kidnapping had expired. At the time of the kidnapping, the act was a capital crime under federal law; capital crimes have no statute of limitations. However, in the 1970s Congress and the Supreme Court redefined kidnapping as a non-capital crime, with a statute of limitations. The lower court did not apply the newer statute of limitations, while the appeals court did. The prosecutors asked the appeals court to reconsider the ruling, and the court agreed to do so en banc. On June 5, 2009, the en banc panel of 5th Circuit judges ruled in an evenly divided decision on the matter, thus upholding the district court's decision. Seale's three convictions and sentences were re- instated. On motion of defense counsel, the 5th Circuit asked the US Supreme Court to review the case.

It is normally dated to AD 34‚Äì37. ==The New Testament accounts== Paul's conversion experience is discussed in both the Pauline epistles and in the Acts of the Apostles. According to both sources, Paul was not a follower of Jesus and did not know him before his crucifixion. Paul's conversion occurred after Jesus's crucifixion. The accounts of Paul's conversion experience describe it as miraculous, supernatural, or otherwise revelatory in nature. ===Before conversion=== Before his conversion, Paul, also known as Saul, was \\"a Pharisee of Pharisees\\", who \\"intensely persecuted\\" the followers of Jesus. Says Paul in his Epistle to the Galatians: \\"For you have heard of my previous way of life in Judaism, how intensely I persecuted the church of God and tried to destroy it. I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my own age among my people and was extremely zealous for the traditions of my fathers.\\" (Galatians 1:13‚Äì14), NIV Paul also discusses his pre-conversion life in his Epistle to the Philippians, and his participation in the stoning of Stephen is described in . ===Pauline epistles=== In the Pauline epistles, the description of the conversion experience is brief. The First Epistle to the Corinthians describes Paul as having seen the risen Christ: The Epistle to the Galatians chapter 1 also describes his conversion as a divine revelation, with Jesus appearing to Paul. ===Acts of the Apostles=== Acts of the Apostles discusses Paul's conversion experience at three different points in the text, in far more detail than in the accounts in Paul's letters. The Book of Acts says that Paul was on his way from Jerusalem to Syrian Damascus with a mandate issued by the High Priest to seek out and arrest followers of Jesus, with the intention of returning them to Jerusalem as prisoners for questioning and possible execution.Acts 9:2 The journey is interrupted when Paul sees a blinding light, and communicates directly with a divine voice. tells the story as a third- person narrative: Ananias Restoring the Sight of St. Paul (c.1631) by Pietro da Cortona. The account continues with a description of Ananias of Damascus receiving a divine revelation instructing him to visit Saul at the house of Judas on the Street Called Straight and there lay hands on him to restore his sight (the house of Judas is traditionally believed to have been near the west end of the street).John Phillips, Exploring Acts: An expository commentary, Kregel Academic, 2001, , p. 179. Ananias is initially reluctant, having heard about Saul's persecution, but obeys the divine command: Agrippa (Acts 26), as pictured by Nikolai Bodarevsky, 1875. Acts' second telling of Paul's conversion occurs in a speech Paul gives when he is arrested in Jerusalem. Paul addresses the crowd and tells them of his conversion, with a description essentially the same as that in , but with slight differences. For example, notes that Paul's companions did not see who he was speaking to, while indicates that they did share in seeing the light (see also Differences between the accounts, below). This speech was most likely originally in AramaicC. K. Barrett, A Critical and Exegetical Commentary on the Acts of the Apostles: Introduction and commentary on Acts XV-XXVIII, Continuum, 2004, , pp. 1029‚Äì1031. (see also Aramaic of Jesus), with the passage here being a Greek translation and summary. The speech is clearly tailored for its Jewish audience, with stress being placed in on Ananias's good reputation among Jews in Damascus, rather than on his Christianity. Acts' third discussion of Paul's conversion occurs when Paul addresses King Agrippa, defending himself against the accusations of antinomianism that have been made against him. This account is briefer than the others. The speech here is again tailored for its audience, emphasizing what a Roman ruler would understand: the need to obey a heavenly vision, and reassuring Agrippa that Christians were not a secret society.Charles H. Talbert, Reading Acts: A Literary and Theological Commentary on the Acts of the Apostles, Smyth & Helwys, 2005, , pp 208‚Äì209. == Differences between the accounts== A contradiction in the details of the account of Paul's revelatory vision given in Acts has been the subject of some debate.Ben Witherington, The Acts of the Apostles: A socio-rhetorical commentary, Eerdmans, 1998, , pp. 312‚Äì13. Whereas states that Paul's travelling companions heard the voice, states that they did not. Traditional readings and modern biblical scholarship both see a discrepancy between these passages, but modern Conservative Evangelical commentators, who hold to the doctrine of the inerrancy of scripture, argue that the contradiction can be explained. The difficulty is clear in the King James Version (KJV), the classical Protestant translation: Likewise, the Catholic New American Bible (NAB) presents a blunt contradiction: However this is ironed out in the Evangelical New International Version (NIV): Fundamentalist commentators like Richard Longenecker argue that first century readers might have understood the two passages to mean that everybody heard the sound of the voice, but \\"only Paul understood the articulated words.\\"Richard N. Longenecker, The Ministry and Message of Paul, Zondervan, 1971, , p. 32.For example, R. C. H. Lenski, Interpretation of the Acts of the Apostles 1‚Äì14, Volume 1, 1944 (reprinted 2008 by Augsburg Fortress, ), p. 356; or the Ignatius Catholic study Bible on Acts 9:7. However, critics of the NIV, New Living Translation, and similar versions contend that the smoothing out of the contradiction is deliberately misleading.Mike Davis, The Atheist's Bible Companion to the New Testament: A Comprehensive Guide to Christian Bible Contradictions. Denver: Outskirts Press, Inc., 2009, pp 169‚Äì70. The debate revolves around two Greek words. The noun œÜœâŒΩ·øÜ (ph≈çnƒì - the source of the English word \\"telephone\\") means \\"voice, utterance, report, faculty of speech\\", but can also be translated \\"sound\\" when referring to an inanimate object.Henry George Liddell and Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon: œÜœâŒΩŒÆ The verb ·ºÄŒ∫Œøœçœâ (akou≈ç - the source of the English word \\"acoustics\\") usually means \\"hear\\", but has a secondary meaning \\"understand\\", which is how most translations render it in for example.Henry George Liddell and Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon: ·ºÄŒ∫Œøœçœâ Resolving the contradiction involves translating œÜœâŒΩ·øÜ and ·ºÄŒ∫Œøœçœâ in Acts 9:7 as \\"hear\\" and \\"sound\\" respectively, but translating the same words in Acts 22:9 as \\"understand\\" and \\"voice\\". Critics doubt if the same author recounting the same story in much the same words in different parts of the same text would have used the same two key terms with such strikingly different meanings. However the alternative is that the author of Acts made a careless slip, and Evangelical theology cannot allow this. Evangelicals point out that in Acts 9:7, ·ºÄŒ∫Œøœçœâ appears in a participle construction with a genitive (·ºÄŒ∫ŒøœçŒøŒΩœÑŒµœÇ Œº·Ω≤ŒΩ œÑ·øÜœÇ œÜœâŒΩ·øÜœÇ), and in Acts 22:9 as a finite verb with an accusative object (œÜœâŒΩ·Ω¥ŒΩ Œø·ΩêŒ∫ ·º§Œ∫ŒøœÖœÉŒ±ŒΩ). Evangelical author Nigel Turner suggests the use of the accusative indicates hearing with understanding.Nigel Turner, Grammatical Insights Into the New Testament, Continuum, 2004, , pp. 87‚Äì90. More commonly, it is asserted that the genitive is used when a person is heard, the accusative for a thing, which goes in the same direction but yields a far weaker argument.J. W. Wenham, The Elements of New Testament Greek, Cambridge, 1991, p. 203.Herbert Weir Smyth and Gordon M. Messing, Greek Grammar, 2nd ed., Harvard University Press, 1956, , p. 323. New Testament scholar Daniel B. Wallace finds this argument based on case inconclusive,Daniel B. Wallace, Greek Grammar Beyond the Basics: An Exegetical Syntax of the New Testament, Zondervan, 1997, , p. 313. and even Evangelical scholars like F. F. Bruce are dubious.Frederick Fyvie Bruce, The Acts of the Apostles: The Greek Text with Introduction and Commentary, 2nd ed, Eerdmans, 1990, , p. 236. ==Theological implications== The Conversion of Saint Paul, a 1600 painting by the Italian artist Caravaggio. The conversion of Paul, in spite of his attempts to completely eradicate Christianity, is seen as evidence of the power of Divine Grace, with \\"no fall so deep that grace cannot descend to it\\"Johann Peter Lange (ed.), A commentary on the Holy Scriptures: critical, doctrinal, and homiletical, Volume 8, Scribner, 1868, p. 24. and \\"no height so lofty that grace cannot lift the sinner to it.\\" It also demonstrates \\"God's power to use everything, even the hostile persecutor, to achieve the divine purpose.\\"Jean Marie Hiesberger, The Catholic Bible, Personal Study Edition: New American Bible, Oxford University Press US, 2007, , p. 341. There is no evidence to suggest that Paul arrived on the road to Damascus already with a single, solid, coherent scheme that could form the framework of his mature theology. Instead, the conversion, and the associated understanding of the significance of the resurrection of the crucified Jesus, caused him to rethink from the ground up everything he had ever believed in, from his own identity to his understanding of Second Temple Judaism and who God really was. The transforming effect of Paul's conversion influenced the clear antithesis he saw \\"between righteousness based on the law,\\"G. Walter Hansen, \\"Paul's Conversion and His Ethic of Freedom in Galatians,\\" in The Road from Damascus: The impact of Paul's conversion on his life, thought, and ministry, Richard N. Longenecker (ed.), Eerdmans, 1997, , pp. 213‚Äì37 (quotes on p. 214). which he had sought in his former life; and \\"righteousness based on the death of Christ,\\" which he describes, for example, in the Epistle to the Galatians. Based on Paul's testimony in Galatians 1 and the accounts in Acts (Acts 9, 22, 26), where it is specifically mentioned that Paul was tasked to be a witness to the Gentiles, it could be interpreted that what happened on the road to Damascus was not just a conversion from first-century Judaism to a faith centred on Jesus Christ, but also a commissioning of Paul as an Apostle to the Gentiles‚Äîalthough in Paul's mind they both amounted to the same thing. ==Alternative explanations== The Acts of the Apostles says that Paul's conversion experience was an encounter with the resurrected Christ. Alternative explanations have been proposed, including sun stroke and seizure. In 1987, D. Landsborough published an article in the Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry,D. Landsborough, \\"St. Paul and Temporal Lobe Epilepsy,\\" J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry 1987; 50; 659‚Äì64: in which he stated that Paul's conversion experience, with the bright light, loss of normal bodily posture, a message of strong religious content, and his subsequent blindness, suggested \\"an attack of , perhaps ending in a convulsion ... The blindness which followed may have been post-ictal.\\" This conclusion was challenged in the same journal by James R. Brorson and Kathleen Brewer,J.R. Brorson and K. Brewer, \\"Matters arising: St Paul and temporal lobe epilepsy,\\" J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry 1988; 51; 886‚Äì87: who stated that this hypothesis failed to explain why Paul's companions heard a voice (Acts 9:7), saw a light, or fell to the ground. Furthermore, no lack of awareness of blindness (a characteristic of cortical blindness) was reported in Acts, nor is there any indication of memory loss. Additionally, Paul's blindness remitted in sudden fashion, rather than the gradual resolution typical of post-ictal states, and no mention is made of epileptic convulsions; indeed such convulsions may, in Paul's time, have been interpreted as a sign of demonic influence, unlikely in someone accepted as a religious leader. A 2012 paper in the Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences suggested that Paul‚Äôs conversion experience might be understood as involving psychogenic events. This occurring in the overall context of Paul‚Äôs other auditory and visual experiences that the authors propose may have been caused by mood disorder associated psychotic spectrum symptoms. ==Cultural references== La conversion de Saint Paul by Luca Giordano (1690), Museum of Fine Arts of Nancy. ===Art=== The conversion of Paul has been depicted by many artists, including Albrecht D√ºrer, Francisco Camilo, Giovanni Bellini, Fra Angelico, Fra Bartolomeo, Pieter Bruegel the Elder, William Blake, Luca Giordano, Sante Peranda, and Juan Antonio de Fr√≠as y Escalante. Michelangelo's The Conversion of Saul is housed in the Cappella Paolina of the Vatican Palace. The Renaissance Italian master Caravaggio painted two works depicting the event: The Conversion of Saint Paul and Conversion on the Way to Damascus. Peter Paul Rubens also produced several works on the theme.Gosudarstvennyƒ≠ ƒñrmitazh, Peter Paul Rubens, a touch of brilliance: oil sketches and related works from the State Hermitage Museum and the Courtauld Institute Gallery, Prestel, 2003. ===Literature === Chapter seventeen of Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man includes a literary device related to the Saul to Paul conversion: \\"'You start Saul, and end up Paul,' my grandfather had often said. 'When you're a youngun, you Saul, but let life whup your head a bit and you starts to trying to be Paul ‚Äì though you still Sauls around on the side.'\\" Paul's conversion is the subject of the medieval play The Digby Conversion of Saint Paul. ===Music=== The conversion of Paul is the main term of argument of Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy's oratorio Paulus (St. Paul), MWV A 14 / Op. 36] (1833‚Äì36). It is also subject of the choral motet Saule, Saule, quid me persequeris by Giaches de Wert (1535‚Äì1596). It is also the focus of an eight part mixed choir a cappella piece (The Conversion of Saul) composed by Z. Randall Stroope. ===Popular usage=== From the conversion of Paul, we get the metaphorical reference to the \\"Road to Damascus\\" that has come to refer to a sudden or radical conversion of thought or a change of heart or mind even in matters outside of a Christian context. For example, Australian politician Tony Abbott was described as having been \\"on his own road to Damascus\\" after pledging increased mental health funding,Mental health experts praise Abbott's spending pledge, ABC News, Thu Jul 1, 2010 12:04am AEST, accessed 3 July 2010. and a New Zealand drug dealer turned police officer was likewise described as taking \\"the first step on the road to Damascus.\\" In science fiction, the book Road to Damascus is based on a sudden political conversion of a self-aware tank, Unit SOL-0045, \\"Sonny,\\" a Mark XX Bolo, on the battlefield. In \\"-30-\\", the finale episode of The Wire, Norman Wilson tells Mayor Tommy Carcetti the Jimmy McNulty/Lester Freamon \\"serial killer\\" hoax is the mayor's \\"road to Damascus\\" moment and likens the detectives' fabrication of a serial killer, which allows them to successfully fund and achieve their actual investigative goals, to Carcetti's adoption of popular campaign platforms he doesn't really care about in order to achieve his actual political agenda. Similar parallel can be drawn to the compromises and decisions made by other entities who've taken shortcuts or otherwise \\"juked\\" the data to achieve their ends, such as the Baltimore Suns managing editors in their pursuit of a Pulitzer Prize. In Episode 3, Season 4 of Downton Abbey, Lady Grantham referred to Lord Grantham‚Äôs change of heart towards his daughter Edith‚Äôs boyfriend as a Damascene Conversion. == Feast day== The Feast of the Conversion of Saint Paul the Apostle is a feast celebrated during the liturgical year on January 25, recounting the conversion. This feast is celebrated in the Roman Catholic, Anglican and Lutheran churches. This feast is at the conclusion of the Week of Prayer for Christian Unity, an international Christian ecumenical observance that began in 1908, which is an octave (an eight-day observance) spanning from January 18 (observed in Anglican and Lutheran tradition as the Confession of Peter, and in the pre-1961 Roman Catholic Church as the feast of the Chair of Saint Peter at Rome) to January 25.Exciting holiness: collects and readings for the festivals by B. Tristam Canterbury Press 2003 pages 54‚Äì55 In rural England, the day functioned much like groundhog day does in the modern-day United States. Supposed prophecies ranged from fine days predicting good harvests, to clouds and mists signifying pestilence and war in the coming months. The collect in the Roman Missal is: :O God, who taught the whole world :through the preaching of the blessed Apostle Paul, :draw us, we pray, nearer to you :through the example of him whose conversion we celebrate today, :and so make us witnesses to your truth in the world.Roman Missal ==See also== ;On Paul's conversion *Acts 9, Acts 22, Acts 26 *Split of early Christianity and Judaism *Tabor Light ;On the Feast day *Calendar of saints *General Roman Calendar *General Roman Calendar of 1954 == References == ==Further reading== * Richard N.

It enrolled day students from the local area, along with a substantial body of regional, national, and international students from around the world who boarded at the school. The last President of its governing board (the AUCC) was Claude Le Vu; the last director was Patrick Sellier. The Coll√®ge C√©venol was founded in 1938 by local Protestant activists and pacifists, and had been shaped from its beginnings by the area's long-standing traditions of resistance to political and religious oppression. From the beginning, the Coll√®ge promoted education linked to principles of nonviolence and the development of mutual understanding and solidarity in a socially and ethnically diverse society. The school's founders were also key organizers of the now-famous community effort, in Le Chambon-sur-Lignon, to shelter and save Jewish refugees during the Second World War. Thus an important part of the school's early development was linked to this much discussed episode. During its early years, from 1938 to 1971, the school was entirely private, and was associated with the Protestant Reformed Church of France, although it welcomed students regardless of their religious or non-religious orientation. From 1971 on, it was part of the French national education system and was secular. It was organized as an ‚Äú√©tablissement priv√© sous contrat d'association‚Äù (a private school associated by contract with the state), a category of French schools that are privately managed, but bound to the national system by contracts which provide basic funding and teacher's salaries, and require adherence to national curricula and other standards. On February 9, 2014, President Andre Gast announced that the College would be closing its doors at the end of the school year, faced with mounting financial difficulties and declining enrollment. ==Founding as L‚ÄôEcole Nouvelle C√©venole == ‚ÄúC√©venol‚Äù is an adjective meaning \\"of the C√©vennes mountains,\\" a nearby mountain range that is historically significant as a site of resistance for French Protestants. Chambon and the Coll√®ge are not located in the C√©vennes themselves, but just to the north, on the high Plateau Vivarais-Lignon. The \\"C√©venol\\" reference in the school's name is thus cultural and historical rather than literal, situating the school's founding within the long heritage of French Protestant (Huguenot) resistance to persecution after the Reformation, for example during the Camisard wars of the early eighteenth century. The peasant fighters called ‚ÄúCamisards‚Äù who struggled against the French crown were also known as ‚ÄúC√©venols‚Äù after the rugged, mountainous terrain that facilitated the small group's ability to resist the much larger forces arrayed against them. In the 1930s, this long-standing regional tradition of resistance and hospitality to refugees became essential to the school's beginnings. In May 1938, at a regional synod of the French √©glise r√©form√©e (the Reformed Church of France, historically the primary Protestant council in France), pastor Andr√© Trocm√©, then assigned to the Protestant church in Chambon, proposed the creation of a new secondary school. His proposal envisioned a school that would address four goals: # work against the rural depopulation and impoverishment of Chambon, then a small farming village in an isolated mountain region; # provide high- quality secondary education for the children of the area's Protestant parishes; # experiment with innovative educational ideas and practices that might eventually spread to the wider public school system; and # provide a milieu in which teachers and students of different nationalities could meet and develop values related to internationalist ideals of cooperation and peace. Working with Edouard Theis, another local pastor, the school's first classes were held in September 1938. On its first day, the school had four teachers and 18 students, and met in a room in the Protestant ‚ÄúTemple‚Äù or church of Chambon. ==Shelter for refugees during World War II== Because of its relatively remote and protected location in Chambon, and because it was founded by the same pastors who became the leaders of local efforts to save refugees from Nazi occupation forces and the French Vichy regime that collaborated with them, the C√©venol school played an integral role in the now- famous efforts of the local citizenry in hiding and protecting several thousand Jewish refugees, including many children, throughout the war. By the late 1930s, Chambon had become the site of several ‚Äúpensions‚Äù or boarding- houses that lodged children drawn from refugee camps in the south of France for victims of the Spanish Civil War. The first pension, organized by Trocm√©, was Les Grillons (Crickets), followed by several more, mostly funded by major international relief organizations. More refugees from the German occupation soon followed, including many Jewish children who were lodged and hidden among the others. During the course of the war, Chambon's remote location made it attractive for other children from more war-torn areas of France as well, and the student body (including Jewish children being hidden in Chambon) grew rapidly, from 40 students in 1939 to 150 in 1940, 250 in 1941, 300 in 1942, and 350 to the end of the war. In this situation, Andr√© and Magda Trocm√©, along with Edouard and Mildred Theis served as both teachers at the C√©venol school and leaders of the town's collective effort to protect the refugees. In recognition of their courage and leadership, they, along with Roland Leenhardt (a future director of the school who was then a pastor in the neighboring village of Tence) and the people of Chambon, were later honored as ‚ÄúRighteous among the Nations‚Äù (sometimes translated as ‚ÄúRighteous Gentiles‚Äù), a secular award given by the State of Israel to distinguish non-Jews who risked their lives during the Holocaust to save Jews from extermination by the Nazis. Chambon was, in fact, the first community to be recognized in this manner by Yad Vashem. ==Second phase: building the Coll√®ge C√©venol== At the end of the war in 1945, a Coll√®ge C√©venol Association (now the AUCC or Association Unifi√©e du Coll√®ge C√©venol) was founded. In 1952 Carl and Florence Sangree, two Americans then associated with the school, founded the AFCC, The American Friends of the Coll√®ge C√©venol. A 16-hectare farm at the edge of Chambon was acquired as the site for a new campus. The American Association helped raise funds (from the Quaker American Friends Service Committee, among others) and organized work-camps at which the school's teachers and students, along with other volunteers, passed the summers living in large tents while they built the present school with their own hands, from clearing roads and digging trenches for pipes, to building a classroom building, dormitories, and fields for sports. For decades, the original stone farmhouse, called Luquet, housed a makeshift gym, library, refectory, and offices; the refectory is still housed there today. The first dormitories were prefabricated wooden chalets donated by friends of the school in Sweden. The ‚ÄúBatisco‚Äù or Batiment Scolaire (the main classroom building used today) was opened in 1953; the science labs in 1957; and a new, relatively comfortable girl's dormitory (Milflor) in 1959. In its first decades especially, the Coll√®ge developed a collective culture distinct from that of other secondary schools. It was a co-educational school from the beginning; male and female students were mixed together in a manner that was relatively rare in French schools, and especially in French boarding schools. The school was open in both a material and an educational sense: it had no walls or gates, and students were encouraged and expected to govern themselves to a significant extent. The school's pacifist and activist origins, its summer work-camps, remote location, and somewhat spartan living conditions for boarding students, encouraged a situation in which teachers and students lived, ate, and worked together in the same modest setting, relatively isolated from the aggressively consumerist and mediatic culture of the early cold war. Through the 1960s, students and teachers together developed a community that, within the limits imposed by the school's Protestant orientation, emphasized tolerance and independence vis-√†-vis dominant ways of thinking. Activities that were relatively rare for the period, such as a student-run assembly, radio station, and magazine, were initiated during these years. Notable teachers during this early period included the philosopher Paul Ricoeur and the writer and nonviolence activist Lanza del Vasto, one of the principle western followers of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi. Notable students from the early years include Alexander Grothendieck, one of the key mathematicians of the twentieth century and a dedicated anti- war activist who had escaped the camps as a child refugee in Chambon during the war, and Delphine Seyrig, an actress and activist now remembered for her roles in a series of important films in the 1960s and 1970s. ==Third and fourth phases: the Coll√®ge-Lyc√©e C√©venol== After 1971 the school became part of the French national education system and its culture gradually changed as the generation of organizers and activists formed during the extraordinary conditions of World War II resistance culture faded away. Primarily because it has never charged high tuition and has never aimed to become an exclusive school for the wealthy, C√©venol has never been financially independent and relies on state funding to survive. After growing to an enrollment of about 500 during the 1980s and 1990s, the school encountered financial difficulties and its enrollment returned to around 300 after 1997. Since that time, the school has gradually improved its funding and seeks to renew its unique history and culture in the conditions of the 21st century. The recent actualities have been marked by the murder of Agn√®s Marin by Matthieu Moulinas, both being pupils here. In its last terms the Coll√®ge enrolled students from about 30 different nations each year, working in classes from the Quatri√®me (the equivalent of 9th grade in the US) to Terminale (the 13th and final or \\"terminal\\" year in the French primary-secondary system, during which students prepare for the Baccalaur√©at examination). It continued to play a role in the local hosting and relief of refugees from conflicts in the Balkans and Eastern Europe. The school maintained partnerships and exchange agreements with several other secondary schools oriented toward international education: * Concord Academy (Massachusetts, US) * Colegio Internacional Europa (Sevilla, Spain) * Goethe-Gymnasium/Rutheneum (Gera (Germany) * Liceo Valdese de Torre Pellice (Italy, a school associated with UNESCO) * Lyc√©e Edmond-Maurice-Edmond de Rothschild de Tel Aviv (Israel) * Soukrom√© Jazykov√© Gymn√°zium in Hradec Kr√°lov√© (Czech Republic) ==Governing Board (AUCC) and school associations== The school's governing board was the Association Unifi√©e du Coll√®ge C√©venol (AUCC). Its meetings assemble representatives of alumni organizations and several French and international Protestant relief organizations. An Association des Anciens du Coll√®ge C√©venol (AACC) now provides organization for meetings and fundraising among alumni in France and Europe, beginning with a 70th Anniversary weekend held in Chambon in May 2009. The APCC (Association des Parents du CC) provided information and networking for parents of enrolled students. ==American Friends of the Coll√®ge C√©venol (AFCC)== The American Friends, a non-profit organization founded in 1952, unites alumni and friends of the Coll√®ge from all of the phases of the school's history. It contributed to the school by organizing an annual fundraising drive among the school's US alumni and by continuing the tradition of the summer work camps that went back to the school's earliest years. The work camps were three-week summer sessions organized for high school and college-age students who experienced the atmosphere of Chambon and the Coll√®ge during the very pleasant summer season in the mountains, worked at community service projects and basic maintenance or repair tasks at the school, and improved their French-language skills. ==Notable alumni and faculty== The French Wikipedia article on the Coll√®ge C√©venol provides French-language links to articles on many of these individuals: * Kate Barry (1967‚Äì2013); photographer * Guy Bechtel (1931‚Äì); historian, author of numerous studies in French early-modern history and culture * Pierre B√©nichou (1938‚Äì); journalist and writer, member of the L√©gion d'honneur * Robert Beno√Æt (1943‚Äì); actor- director known for work in films, television, and theatre; appeared alongside fellow C√©venol alum Delphine Seyrig in The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie (1972) * Christophe Berthonneau (1964‚Äì); theatre director, award-winning pyro- designer and founder of Group F, creator of major fireworks performances including opening and closing ceremonies of numerous Olympic Games during the 1990s and 2000s * Michael Bess, Department of History, Vanderbilt University, author of \\"Choices under fire.

While weight classes are generally not strictly adhered to in professional wrestling today, this particular championship is usually competed for by wrestlers weighing less than 230 lbs. ==History== For a time, the title was defended in the W*ING promotion in Japan as the W*ING World Junior Heavyweight Championship. Originally, the title was used to push a wrestler that the promotion was interested in, becoming a stepping stone on the route to the WWC Universal Heavyweight Championship. A pattern was followed where these talents would win the Junior Heavyweight Championship first, followed by tertiary and secondary titles, before progressing to the main event. By the 2010s, promoting up-and-comers became a secondary function, with the title now being used to appease journeymen and occasionally punish wrestlers that failed to draw. Independent wrestlers and veterans such as Tommy Diablo (Armando Gorbea) would exchange the title, which served as a perpetual card opener. ===2017 international tours=== After defeating √Ångel P√©rez to win the title for the first time and aware that the it was no longer being used to push new or young talents, O.T. Fern√°ndez requested permission to take it abroad, citing interest in returning it to its original format and reputation by stating that he was \\"going to keep representing and showcasing the title with the best of [his] abilities [and that he wanted] to keep elevating this championship back to its old roots.\\" In May 2017, he took the title on the Dragonman√≠a XII tour held at the Arena M√©xico, marking the first time in years that the title was exposed internationally, tough it was not officially defended. On July 8, 2017, Fern√°ndez successfully retained the title over Aero Boy in a Cleveland Knights Championship Wrestling (CKCW) card held at Ohio. His reign continued gathering outside exposition by making an appearance in a WAPA-TV comedy named \\"Such is Life\\". Fern√°ndez's successor, √Ångel Cotto, continued the trend by defending the title at Chicago as part of IWC's Halloween In Your Face event, retaining against Julio \\"V√©rtigo\\" Rivera by getting himself disqualified. ===Postmortem, IWA Florida (2018‚Äìpresent)=== After the title was quietly retired, the incumbent left WWC with the belt in his possession. On October 17, 2018, Cotto debuted in the rival World Wrestling League, where the fact that he never lost the WWC World Junior Heavyweight Championship was worked into a storyline that saw him challenge WWL Super Cruiserweight Champion Mark Davidson. On November 12, 2018, the actual belt made an appearance (as the \\"Puerto Rico Middleweight Championship\\") in a video announcing his arrival to IWA Florida, itself a spinoff of WWC's longstanding competition, the International Wrestling Association (IWA-PR). On December 7, 2018, the WWC World Junior Heavyweight Championship made its first physical appearance (though it was partially obscured) in WWL as part of Cotto's promotional skit for Black Xmas, where he felt short in his attempt to accomplish an extra-official unification. On December 17, 2018, IWA Florida announced that he would be exposing the title in an open challenge at Histeria Boricua 2019. As part of that event, Papi Nieves won the belt and was attacked backstage. This led to a formal feud against Cotto. Nieves‚Äô reign ended on March 16, 2019, when he dropped the belt back to its former owner at the IWA Arena. Cotto would then take it to Chicago, appearing in Global Wrestling Stars‚Äô Noche Xtrema event. Even when entering a tournament for the IWA Florida Tag Team Championship, his incumbency as champion was emphasized. When queried about carrying and defending the belt, Cotto said that he would return it to WWC if an ‚Äúeconomic agreement is reached with Carlos Col√≥n‚Äù. He continued being billed as the ‚Äúincumbent champion‚Äù afterwards, making appearances in this role in August 2019. ==Title history== ==References== ==External links== *Wrestling- Titles.com *Wrestling Information Archive *Wrestlingdata.com Category:Junior heavyweight wrestling championships Category:World Wrestling Council championships Category:World professional wrestling championships ","title":"WWC World Junior Heavyweight Championship"},{"id":"9115454","text":"Victory Bonds rally, 1943The National War Finance Committee was set up in Canada in December 1941 by the Department of Finance.

Built in 1912, it was originally created to host live theater performances, but was converted to allow motion pictures in 1931. It has been in continuous operation since its opening, with a few brief intervals for refurbishing. ==Architecture== Architect Harrison Albright designed the Spreckels Theater for the city's premier philanthropist, sugar heir John D. Spreckels. The building, which opened on August 23, 1912, was constructed to commemorate the opening of the Panama Canal. As with many west coast buildings from this era, it is constructed of reinforced concrete and concrete panels with architectural terra cotta manufactured by Gladding, McBean. The six-story building has a marquee over the main entrance. The theater is a 1,915-seat auditorium with an ornate Baroque interior. The auditorium is open with no pillars or columns to obstruct sightlines. The number of seats was chosen to correspond with the Panama-California Exposition year (1915). The stage is 82 feet x 58 feet, and was one of the largest stages ever constructed. ==History== The theater originally presented live theatrical productions. Notable performers at the Spreckels included Enrico Caruso, John Barrymore, Al Jolson, Will Rogers, and Abbott and Costello.San Diego Union Tribune, Sep. 30, 1992 In 1931, it was converted into a first-run motion picture house by its then-owner Louis B.

The company transitioned its mobile product to the delivery of live cable television to desktop computers with their Virtual Digital Cable service launched in April 2006. In October 2006, VDC became one of the first providers to utilize the Microsoft Silverlight technology to provide secure, live distribution of streaming television. In January 2007, VDC made public its decision to file a program- access complaint with the FCC to commence a proceeding to obtain enforcement of the program access rules under the 1992 Cable TV Consumer Protection Act, to ensure vertically integrated programming providers sell their programming to VDC. Such providers include Time Warner (CNN, TNT, TBS, Cartoon Network, HBO), Liberty Media, (Discovery Channel), Cablevision (Rainbow) and Comcast (E!, Golf Channel). In late January 2010, the company posted a notice on their website stating that they had ceased offering subscriptions pending the FCC's decision on their program-access complaint. This remained in place at least until July 2011; the website has since been replaced with a generic domain parking page. ==Controversies== Congress attempted to encourage growth and competition in the vertically integrated cable marketplace with the 1992 Cable TV Consumer Protection Act. Using the internet, VDC claims to have brought diversity and increased competition to the marketplace: > The term 'multichannel video programming distributor' means an entity > engaged in the business of making available for purchase, by subscribers or > customers, multiple channels of video programming. Such entities include, > but are not limited to, a cable operator, a multichannel multipoint > distribution service, a direct broadcast satellite service, a television > receive-only satellite program distributor, and a satellite master antenna > television system operator, as well as buying groups or agents of all such > entities.47 CFR 76.1000(e) - Code of Federal Regulations VDC's complaint with the FCC was filed against Turner Broadcasting SystemStreamer Seeks Program Access - 1/22/2007 - Multichannel News to force Turner into compliance with the 1992 Cable Act and to recognize VDC as an MVPD. This would grant VDC mandatory access to broadcast Turner's programming on VDC's MVPD system. The FCC debate also raises regulatory and broadcast issues involving net neutrality. ==ReferencesCategory:Cable television companies of the United States Category:Internet television ","title":"Virtual Digital Cable"},{"id":"9115479","text":"Abraham L√©vy-Bacrat (◊ê◊ë◊®◊î◊ù ◊î◊ú◊ï◊ô ◊ë◊ß◊®◊ê◊ò; fl. 1492‚Äì1507) was a rabbinical author of the beginning of the sixteenth century.

It is a high altitude mountain tree, growing at elevations of 3,000-4,000 m (exceptionally down to 2,400 m and up to 4,300 m), often occupying the tree line. The species is named after its discoverer, Father Pierre Jean Marie Delavay, who collected it at 3,500-4,000 m on the Cang Mountain near Dali.Franchet, A. (1899). Plantarum Sinensium. J. de Botanique 13: 253-260. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree growing to 7-40 m tall, often less at tree line. The shoots are purple-brown to dark red- brown, glabrous or finely pubescent. The leaves are needle-like, 15-30 mm long and 1-2 mm broad, with a distinctive revolute margin. The upper surface of the leaves is glossy dark green with no stomata, the underside vivid snow-white with the stomata densely covered in white wax; this is thought to be an adaptation to exclude very heavy rain in its monsoon climate.Rushforth, K. (1984). Abies delavayi and A. fabri. Int. Dendrol. Soc. Yearb. 1983: 118-120. The cones are dark purple-blue, 6‚Äì12 cm long and 3-4.5 cm broad, with numerous small scales and exserted bracts; they break up when mature at 6‚Äì8 months old to release the winged seeds.

On 7 June 1753, at Tower Hill, he was the last Jacobite to be executed for high treason. ==Before the uprising== Archibald Cameron was born in 1707, the sixth child (and third surviving son) of Isabel (n√©e Campbell) and John Cameron, the 18th Lochiel.Clan Cameron Genealogies. Cameron's father, The Lochiel, had participated in the failed 1715 Jacobite rising and, as a result, had become an exile, living first in Paris and then Boulogne, and not returning to Scotland until November 1745. Archibald Cameron's elder brother was Donald Cameron of Lochiel, who was the Clan Cameron chief in the absence of their father, and is known in Jacobite history as \\"The Gentle Lochiel\\". Archibald Cameron initially attended the University of Glasgow to study law, before transferring to study medicine at University of Edinburgh. He completed further studies at the Sorbonne in Paris and the University of Leiden in the Netherlands. He subsequently returned to the Scottish Highlands, married his Lochaber cousin, Jean Cameron,fionamsinclair.co.uk and fathered seven children.The Newgate Calendar (1824): Account of Cameron's execution. == 1745 uprising == When Charles Edward Stuart (\\"Bonnie Prince Charlie\\") first arrived in Scotland Cameron was despatched by his brother to Loch nan Uamh to communicate the futility of the enterprise and persuade the Prince to return to France. However, Prince Charles persuaded Cameron otherwise and soon the Camerons joined him in armed revolt. Archibald Cameron first saw action in late August 1745, when he helped to lead a fairly futile attack on Ruthven Barracks. In the campaign that followed Cameron seems to have been promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel in his brother's clan regiment.Clan Cameron Archives Account of the Battle The Newgate Calendar's hagiography portrays him as being a pacifist by nature, refusing to offer more than his surgical skills in the cause, but this is likely to be inaccurateexclassics.com since Cameron was slightly wounded in action at the Battle of Falkirk in January 1746.Account from the Clan Cameron Archive He is also recorded as having performed surgery on his brother after he suffered two broken ankles and other injuries at the Battle of Culloden. The defeat at Culloden ended the Jacobites' hopes, and both Cameron brothers, along with their father, became fugitives from government troops. After the burning of the family seat, Achnacarry House, the Cameron family hid at Badenoch. However, despite the danger, the Prince was determined to meet The Lochiel. Archibald Cameron was sent to Loch Arkaig to escort the Prince to the family's hiding place (3 September). The whole party then moved to Ben Alder, the seat of Ewen MacPherson of Cluny, keeper of the Loch Arkaig treasure. At Ben Alder Castle on 13 September 1746 word came that French naval ships were waiting at Loch nan Uamh, and on these the whole party escaped to France on 19 September. == Betrayal and execution == In exile Cameron remained in Prince Charles's service, travelling with him to Madrid in 1748 and returning to Scotland privately in 1749. In 1753 he was sent back to Scotland again to obtain money from Loch Arkaig and to participate in a desperate plot to assassinate George II and other members of the British royal family. However, while he was staying secretly at Brenachyle by Loch Katrine, he was betrayed by MacDonell of Glengarry, the notorious \\"Pickle the spy\\", and members of his own clan who by this time were sickened by his Jacobitism. He was arrested and attainted of high treason under the Attainder of Earl of Kellie and Others Act 1746 (19 Geo. 2, c. 26) for his part in the 1745 uprising. He was imprisoned in Edinburgh Castle then taken to Tower Hill in London.The Peerage website. On 7 June 1753 Cameron was drawn on a sledge to Tyburn and hanged for 20 minutes before being cut down and beheaded. His remains were buried in the Savoy Chapel, Westminster.The history of Clan Cameron He was the last Jacobite to receive the death penalty. In his final papers, written from prison, he still protested his undying loyalty to the Jacobite cause and his episcopalian principles.\\"Letters Written in the Tower of London 5-6 June 1753\\", Clan Cameron archives In 1753 John Cameron of Dochanassie composed \\"A Song to Doctor Cameron\\", a song in Gaelic in commemoration of Cameron's life.\\"A Song to Doctor Cameron\\", Clan Cameron archives.

Retrieved February 12, 2007. ==Incident== Four people were shot dead in clashes between pro- and anti-government activists on Thursday and about 200 were hurt in the violence that flared after a scuffle between students at a Beirut university. The opposition accused the government camp of starting the riots and the four dead included two Hezbollah students, who were fired at from rooftops. Opposition backers said gunmen fired from apartment balconies near the school, wounding several people. Students said the clashes began with a scuffle in the cafeteria of Beirut Arab University and degenerated into a melee as youths in the surrounding Tarik el-Jadideh district moved in. They threw rocks, set fire to tires to block traffic, torched cars and smashed windshields amid the rattle of gunshots as troops fired into the air to try to disperse the crowds. There were reports of gunfire and pictures showed masked men holding guns and assault-rifles. ==Response== Hezbollah secretary general Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah went on TV in the evening to tell followers it was a \\"religious duty\\" to get off the streets to allow security forces to keep order. \\"I call upon the Lebanese to cooperate with the Lebanese army in all districts to end the tension in this hard and painful hour for all the Lebanese,\\" Nasrallah said in a broadcast audio message. \\"I appeal to you in the name of Lebanon and human conscience.

United States ambassador Jeffrey Feltman was quick to point the finger at Syria. \\"History has shown that outside powers like Syria have done it before. And I can't give you solid evidence, but one can certainly make a pretty strong case that it's Syria's hands at work again,\\" he said on US-funded Al- Hurra television. MP Walid Jumblatt of the parliamentary majority added voice to Feltman's accusation, saying the fighting was triggered by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. ==Context== The opposition launched nationwide protests on Tuesday which shut down much of Lebanon before being attacked by assailants. The attack sparked violence in which three people were killed and 176 wounded. The general strike intensified a street campaign that began on December 1 when opposition supporters began camping out near Siniora's offices in downtown Beirut. They are backing demands for the Western-backed government to give in to the formation of a government of national unity and early parliamentary elections or quit. Siniora and his main backer, parliamentary majority leader Hariri, have refused to give in to the demands. ==References== Category:2007 crimes in Lebanon Category:2007 murders in Asia Arab University shooting Category:2000s murders in Lebanon Category:21st-century mass murder in Lebanon Arab University shooting Shooting Category:Deaths by firearm in Lebanon Category:January 2007 crimes Category:January 2007 events in Asia Category:Mass murder in 2007 Arab University shooting Category:Mass shootings in Lebanon Category:Terrorist incidents in Asia in 2007 Arab University shooting Category:Terrorist incidents in Lebanon in the 2000s Category:University and college killings in Asia Category:University and college shootings ","title":"Beirut Arab University shooting"},{"id":"9115529","text":"The Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria has many churches and congregations in the continent of Asia.

From 1912 to 1924, he served as the team captain of the British fencing team. ===British Championships=== Seligman was the British epee champion in 1904 and 1906, the foil champion in 1906‚Äì07, and the sabre champion in 1923 and 1924. ===Intercalated Games=== Seligman (39 years of age) first competed at the 1906 \\"Intercalated Games\\" held in Athens to renew interest in the Olympic Games. Although considered \\"unofficial,\\" the Games attracted 900 athletes from 20 countries. The British √©p√©e team came in second. The Games succeeded in renewing interest in the Olympics, and Seligman competed in his first \\"official\\" Olympiad 2 years later at the 1908 London Games. ===1908 London Olympic Games=== With England the host country in 1908, Seligman (41 years of age) and his teammates won the silver medal in the team √©p√©e competition (they defeated Belgium and Denmark to win the silver). Seligman was not successful in the individual √©p√©e, however, losing in the 1st round. The \\"Official Report\\" of the Olympics stated that his \\"failure was unaccountable and naturally caused disappointment.\\" ===1912 Stockholm Olympic Games=== Four years later at the 1912 Stockholm Olympics, Seligman (45 years of age) captained the British fencing team, competed in 3 events, and won another medal (he reached the finals in all 3 of his events). In the team √©p√©e competition, Seligman and the British team won the silver. In the individual √©p√©e, Seligman finished 6th overall after winning only 2 of 7 matches in the final round. He also competed in the individual foil event and won 3 of 7 matches in the finals, to finish in 6th place. ===1920 Antwerp Games=== At the 1920 Antwerp Games (there were no Olympics in 1916 due to World War I), Edgar (53 years of age) was again the British captain and finished in 7th place in the team foil competition, and 5th in the team √©p√©e. ===1924 Paris Olympic Games=== At the 1924 Paris Games, Seligman (57 years of age) was captain for a third time. In the first three rounds of the competition in the individual foil event, he won 12 of 13 matches and easily advanced to the finals. Unfortunately, according to the Olympic Games of 1924 British Report: \\"in the final pool of the individual foil event, he [Seligman] slipped in the course of his second fight and strained his leg, with the result that he was compelled to retire ‚Äì a most unfortunate happening, since he had previously won his fight against Roger Ducret of France, the eventual Olympic winner.\\" In Paris Seligman also managed to compete in the individual sabre and team foil events. In the individual sabre, he finished 3rd in his elimination pool, but then forfeited in the semifinals. The British team was eliminated in the quarterfinals; Seligman fenced in both matches and won 6 of 8 bouts combined. He was also scheduled to participate in the team √©p√©e and team sabre, but his injury did not allow him to compete. ===1928 and 1932 Olympic Games=== At the Art competitions at the 1928 Summer Olympics and Art competitions at the 1932 Summer Olympics, Seligman competed in the Mixed Painting Art Competitions. ==See also== * List of select Jewish fencers ==References* British Olympic Association record * British Olympic Association bio * Jews in Sports bio Category:1867 births Category:1958 deaths Category:British male fencers Category:Jewish fencers Category:Jewish British sportspeople Category:British people of German-Jewish descent Category:Olympic fencers of Great Britain Category:Olympic silver medallists for Great Britain Category:Olympic medalists in fencing Category:Medalists at the 1906 Intercalated Games Category:Medalists at the 1908 Summer Olympics Category:Medalists at the 1912 Summer Olympics Category:Fencers at the 1906 Intercalated Games Category:Fencers at the 1908 Summer Olympics Category:Fencers at the 1912 Summer Olympics Category:Fencers at the 1920 Summer Olympics Category:Fencers at the 1924 Summer Olympics Category:British Yeomanry soldiers Category:Sportspeople from San Francisco Category:Naturalised citizens of the United Kingdom Category:British artists Category:Olympic competitors in art competitions ","title":"Edgar Seligman"},{"id":"9115611","text":"The Nandi Award for Best Costume Designer winners since 1981:  - !

The story in the book takes place during the Weimar Republic in Germany. The novel by Heinrich Spoerl was published in 1933 and was adapted to film three times. The 1944 movie of the same name directed by Helmut Weiss is the most notable adaptation of the material. This German comedy classic was one of the last big movie productions in Germany before the end of the Nazi era and has gained cult status at German universities since the 1980s. ==Authorship== Die Feuerzangenbowle: Eine Lausb√ºberei in der Kleinstadt was written by Heinrich Spoerl. The novel adopts ideas from Ernst Eckstein's Der Besuch im Karzer (published 1875) and was partly inspired by personal accounts of Spoerl's own schooldays as well as his son's pranks at school.Alexander Spoerl: Memoiren eines mittelm√§√üigen Sch√ºlers, 24. edition, dtv 1982, page 27. The first edition was published in 1933 by Droste Verlag. On March 12th, 2010, the Landgericht Hamburg (county court) ruled that Hans Reimann is not co- author of the novel. The fact that Spoerl shared his royalties with Reimann is in no way to be considered as proof of co-authorship. The court decided that the publishing contract on the novel, signed by Spoerl alone, clearly indicates his exclusive authorship. ==Plot summary== The title refers to the Feuerzangenbowle punch consumed by a group of gentlemen in the opening scene. While they exchange nostalgic stories about their schooldays, the successful young writer Dr. Johannes Pfeiffer realizes he missed out on something because he was taught at home and never attended school. He decides to make up for it by masquerading as a student at a small-town high school. At the school he quickly gains a reputation as a prankster. Together with his classmates, he torments his professors Crey, B√∂mmel and Headmaster Knauer with adolescent mischief. His girlfriend Marion unsuccessfully tries to persuade him to give up his foolish charade. Eventually, he falls in love with the headmaster's daughter and discloses his identity after provoking the teachers into expelling him from school. ==CharactersHans Pfeiffer=== Dr. Johannes Pfeiffer is an accomplished playwright in Berlin who never attended regular school as he was educated at home. His friends' nostalgic recollections of their schooldays convince him that he missed out on something and he decides to go undercover as a gymnasium student in the fictional small town Babenberg. He introduces himself as Hans Pfeiffer \\"with three F ‚Äì one before and two after the ei and quickly gets into the habit of playing elaborate pranks on his teachers. ===The teachers=== The teachers in the story are stereotypic parodies of different teaching styles. Professors B√∂mmel and Crey represent liberal and conservative teaching styles respectively, but neither has much luck in gaining the students' respect. The teachers' exaggerated individual quirks and particularly their dialects set them up to be easy targets for imitation and ridicule by the students. Some have acquired nicknames based on their looks. Headmaster Knauer, for example, is known as \\"Zeus\\" among the students, whereas Professor Crey is referred to as \\"Schnauz\\" (mustache). The teacher Brett in the 1944 movie, who represents the authoritarian style popularized at the time, does not appear in the book.Sven Maier: Die Feuerzangenbowle, filmstarts.de Kritiken ===The women=== Two women play central roles in the story and Pfeiffer's life. Pfeiffer's lover Marion is a modern and self-assured \\"big city girl\\". She travels to Babenberg to try to convince Pfeiffer of the foolishness of his actions and bring him back to Berlin. Pfeiffer declines and she threatens to blow his cover. This makes her the bad girl of the story in accordance with the ideologies of the times reproving emancipated and sinful women like Marion.Georg See√ülen, 1994: \\"Die Feuerzangenbowle In: epd Film 3/94. She eventually loses Pfeiffer when he falls in love with innocent blonde Eva, Headmaster Knauer's daughter, who embodies the ideal image of a proper \\"girl next door\\". ==Adaptations== The novel has been adapted into three films: * 1934: So ein Flegel * 1944: Die Feuerzangenbowle * 1970: Die Feuerzangenbowle Theater: * D√ºsseldorf-Bilk, 2004 * Coburger Landestheater, 2006 Musical: * Neu-Isenburg, 2004 ==Notes and references== ==External links== * - in German Category:1933 German-language novels Category:1933 German novels Category:German comedy novels Category:German novels adapted into films Category:Novels set in Germany Category:Novels set in schools ","title":"Die Feuerzangenbowle"},{"id":"9115672","text":"Pendleton Round-Up Happy Canyon Hall of Fame The Pendleton Round-Up and Happy Canyon Hall of Fame, is a hall of fame located in Pendleton, Oregon, United States.

He was an English born French Roman Catholic in this Protestant court and this implies that his father was part of the Queen's staff. Bayly was sent to France at age 12 or 13 and some time later was returning to London, was brought on board a ship headed for America and spent 14 years as a bond-servant. He appears in Quaker records as a member and living in Anne Arundel County, Maryland in 1657. He returned to England in 1660 and there followed years of travel and imprisonment for various actions as a Quaker. In 1670, for reasons undetermined, Bayly was released from prison and made the first overseas governor of the Hudson's Bay Company and in June sailed for Fort Nelson at the mouth of the Nelson River. This was the first headquarters of the Hudson's Bay Company in North America. Bayly spent 1670 and 1671, until they sailed home, exploring and trading, mostly from the HBC location at Rupert River which had been established in 1668 by an expedition of M√©dard des Groseilliers. In subsequent years he established the first post at Moose Factory and explored and developed trade. In 1679 Bayly was recalled under charges of mismanagement; probably related to poor management rather than dishonesty. His career at the HBC, despite the charges, was successful. Although he neglected book-keeping detail, his activities in James Bay were important to the Company's first ten years of its existence. He died while the charges were being prepared. == External links == * Biography at the Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online Category:Explorers of Canada Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Year of death unknown Category:Hudson's Bay Company people ","title":"Charles Bayly"},{"id":"9115693","text":"The Nandi Award for Best Film Critic winners since 1999: { cellspacing=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" border=\\"0\\" width=\\"20%\\" - bgcolor=\\"#d1e4fd\\" !

Veneracion. Carpio has taken the already much-awarded choir to even greater heights, when he led them to win first prizes in the Habanera and Polyphony categories in the Cert√°men Internacional de Habaneras y Polifonia (Torrevieja, Spain, 2004), the Grand Prix in the 35th Florilege Vocal de Tours, France (2006), the Grand Prize in the European Grand Prix for Choral Singing (Arrezo, Italy, 2007), and the Grand Prix in the 64th Concorso Polifonico Guido d‚ÄôArezzo (Arezzo, Italy, 2016).

Carpio also directs the other Sing Philippines projects which include choral music workshops and conductor/singer development initiatives. He is the artistic director for the MADZ Music Studios, which strives to go beyond in teaching students on how to sing or play but to instill in them on how they can inspire others, as they work in making music together. Known for his collaboration with emerging composers, innovative programming, and approachability, Carpio is a much sought-after choral clinician and coach, frequently giving extensive and in- depth workshops all over the Philippines and around the world. He is frequently invited as adjudicator in choral competitions and as guest conductor of choirs around the world, including the first batch of the Indonesia Youth Choir (2015).

Charles M. Schwab of Bethlehem Steel described Samuel T. Wellman as \\"the man who did more than any other living person in the development of steel\\". Wellman was a close friend of electrical pioneer George Westinghouse, and he was also president of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers from 1901 to 1902. ==Early life== Born in Wareham, Massachusetts in 1847, Wellman was the son of a Nashua Iron Company superintendent.Wellman, Joshua Wyman Descendants of Thomas Wellman (1918) Arthur Holbrook Wellman, Boston pp.69-72&455 Wellman received his formal engineering training from Norwich University in Norwich, Vermont, and served as a corporal with the First New Hampshire Heavy Artillery during the Civil War. Shortly after the war, Wellman married Julia A. Ballard, with whom he had five children. ==Career and influence on the steel industry== Wellman began his career working at the Nashua Iron Company. He was encouraged by his father to build a regenerative gas furnace for the company. Wellman did this, impressing Carl Wilhelm Siemens, who immediately hired him to establish the first crucible-steel furnace in America. Wellman went on to improve upon the open-hearth process of steel rail production, which in turn had improved upon the Bessemer process. In 1869, Wellman built the first commercially successful open-hearth furnace in America at the Bay State Iron Works in South Boston. Hulett Electric Ore Unloader, Toledo, Ohio, 1919 Furnaces were not Wellman's only contribution to the steel industry. He was also instrumental in the development of the Hulett unloader, which allowed the unloading of taconite from the iron ore boats of the Great Lakes, particularly on Lake Erie. In addition to improvements on the Hulett unloader, other important inventions include an open hearth charging machine and a hydraulic crane. Following an unsuccessful venture with his half-brother, Wellman later founded the Wellman- Seaver-Morgan Engineering Company in Cleveland, Ohio, which continues under a different name to this day. ==Partial list of inventions== *Automatic bail gripping or locking device for electric cranes *Furnace charging apparatus *Open hearth steel furnace **Complete list of patents on Google Scholar ==Selected publications== *Wellman, S.

In forests, it tends to present as a low canopy tree; in open situations it usually forms a large, broadly spreading shrub. Elevation ranges from 900 m to 3,700 m. ==Growth== It is a medium-sized evergreen coniferous tree growing to 20 m tall, similar to Taxus baccata and sometimes treated as a subspecies of it. The shoots are green at first, becoming brown after three or four years. The leaves are thin, flat, slightly falcate (sickle-shaped), 1.5‚Äì2.7 cm long and 2 mm broad, with a softly mucronate apex; they are arranged spirally on the shoots but twisted at the base to appear in two horizontal ranks on all except for erect lead shoots. It is dioecious, with the male and female cones on separate plants; the seed cone is highly modified, berry-like, with a single scale developing into a soft, juicy red aril 1 cm diameter, containing a single dark brown seed 7 mm long. The pollen cones are globose, 4 mm diameter, produced on the undersides of the shoots in early spring. ==Species== Similar plants occurring further east through China to Taiwan, Vietnam and the Philippines are included in Taxus wallichiana as T. wallichiana var. chinensis (Pilger) Florin by some authors, but are more often treated as a separate species Taxus chinensis.Rushforth, K. (1987). Conifers. Helm .Farjon, A. (1998). World Checklist and Bibliography of Conifers. Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew . ==Medicinal uses== The tree has medicinal use in Ayurveda and Tibetan medicine. Taxus wallichiana is also a source of the chemical precursors to the anticancer drug paclitaxel.Medicinal plants on verge of extinction - environment - 10 January 2009 - New Scientist Taxus wallichiana is used for making tea by the Bhotiya tribal community in the Garhwal Himalaya. The stem bark of this species, which is locally known as thuner, is collected for this purpose. This species is also used as fuelwood by the local communities. In Himachal it is known to be medicine for some types of cancer. ==Conservation== The Himalayan yew has been subject to heavy exploitation for its leaves and bark across most of its range through the Himalayas and western China. Declines have been particularly heavy in India and Nepal, with losses of up to 90% having been reported. The degree of exploitation in other locations in its range is less well known, but is also assumed to be serious. The species is currently classified as endangered by the IUCN. It is present in several protected areas, and at least some conservation and propagation measures are underway, with an eye to its commercial value in the medicine trade. ==References== wallichiana Category:Trees of Afghanistan Category:Flora of tropical Asia Category:Medicinal plants Category:Endangered plants Category:Plants used in traditional Chinese medicine Category:Plants used in Ayurveda Category:Trees of India Category:Trees of China Category:Trees of Nepal ","title":"Taxus wallichiana"},{"id":"9115752","text":"Bell House or Bellhouse may refer to: ==PlacesCanada=== * Bell House (1910), a notable residence in Nutana, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada * Bellhouse Provincial Park, British Columbia ===Ireland=== * Bell House (Ireland), part of Cambridge House Grammar School's house system named after musician Derek Bell ===United Kingdom=== * Bell House Gallery, Buntingford, England * Bell House, Dulwich, England * Ramsden Bellhouse, a village in Essex * Bell House Common, Hanworth, Norfolk, England * Bell House, Milton of Campsie, Stirlingshire, Scotland, a Prospect 100 best modern Scottish building * Bell houses, houses of George Bell ===United States=== * Willie Bell House, Mason's Bend, Alabama, a Rural Studio project * Bell House (Prattville, Alabama) * Bell House (Jonesboro, Arkansas) * Lake-Bell House, Prairie Grove, Arkansas * Bell House (Searcy, Arkansas) * James George Bell House, a National Register of Historic Places listing in Los Angeles County, California * Bell Farmhouse, Newark, Delaware * R.

Many tenant farmers in the province were unhappy with their inability to gain title in the land they worked. Most also faced burdensome rents. The grants were conditional on certain settlement conditions which were often not fulfilled. However, the political connection of the grantees generally meant that the government could not or would not contest them, in spite of calls from the province's tenants.The Absentee Landlord Question - Prince Edward Island. ==Activity== The league was created in December 1864. By the summer of 1864, most of the Island's tenants were members. In a convention at Charlottetown, the league adopted a constitution which urged its members to withhold payment of rents. At a parade in 1865 the government attempted to arrest Samuel Fletcher, the league's leader. However, the crowd of members prevented it. Governor George Dundas then banned the organization, but they refused to disband. Defiance and collective action would continue to characterize the league's existence, as they clashed with officials dispatched to collect rents.The Tenant League / Tenant League Riots. This prompted the introduction of British troops to put down the \\"Tenant League Riots\\" in 1866. ==Influence== In 1873, after a failed railroad project pushed the Island almost to bankruptcy, it joined the Dominion of Canada. Under the terms of union, the government of Canada provided financial help to the province in purchasing the remaining leaseholds. In 1878 PEI passed its compulsory Land Purchase Act which finally dispossessed the absentee landlords and made the land available for purchase in fee simple to the local population.Prince Edward Island.

More specifically, as a New York State public-benefit corporation, DASNY provides services for public and non-proprietary (i.e., nonprofit) private universities in New York State; for not-for-profit healthcare facilities in the State; and for other New York State-related institutions/purposes (such as State court facilities and State pension bonds). Like other public authorities in New York, DASNY has the flexibility to borrow on behalf of the state through legislative authorization, rather than incurring general obligation debt, which requires voter approval. ==Organization== Broadway in Albany The Authority is governed by an eleven- member board of directors: five board members are appointed by the governor, four serve ex officio, one is named by the Speaker of the New York State Assembly, and one is named by the majority leader of the New York State Senate. In 2017, the authority had operating expenses of $2.399 billion, an outstanding debt of $47.856 billion, and a staffing level of 557 people. ==History== DASNY was established by a law signed into action by New York Governor Thomas Dewey on April 5, 1944. At first, its only purpose was for the financing and construction of dormitories at eleven State Teachers' Colleges in New York. Since then, the Authority has constructed additional buildings, for different kinds of organizations, and significantly expanded the scope of services that it provides. In 1964, DASNY gained the power to finance and construct facilities for hospitals with nursing schools. Legislation passed in 1987 enabled DASNY to finance and construct court facilities for New York's county and local governments. The merger, in 1995, of DASNY with two other agencies (the Facilities Development Corporation and Medical Care Facilities Finance Agency) created the largest government building construction agency in the country, as well as the biggest public-authority issuer of tax-exempt bonds. At the end of fiscal year 2015, DASNY's outstanding debt was more than $47 billion. Of this amount, $32 billion was issued on behalf of New York and its municipalities; $10 billion for independent colleges and universities and other non-profit organizations; and $4.9 billion for non-profit health care organizations. ==Controversies== In 1982, $300 million of DASNY funds had been lent to Lombard-Wall, Inc., a government securities firm that declared bankruptcy in August of that year. At the time of the bankruptcy filing, or shortly before, DASNY determined that $55 million of this amount lacked collateral, and was therefore at risk. The failure of Lombard-Wall prompted a re-examination of cash management by New York state agencies. An report later that year from the state Commission of Investigation called for the removal of two DASNY board members who, according to the commission, withheld damaging information about the risky investments from other board members. However, the commission found no evidence of corrupt practice or criminal wrongdoing. George D. Gould was appointed chairman of DASNY to direct its recovery efforts; Gould stepped down in 1985. Issuance of DASNY bonds for economic development projects began in 1998, with the Community Enhancement Facilities Assistance Program (CEFAP). Since then, approximately $1.9 billion has been spent on a number of relatively small projects, through more than ten different programs, among them the State and Municipal Facilities Program (SAM). In 2015, $188 million was awarded across 640 awards. Critics have called for greater transparency in this exercise of Dormitory Authority borrowing power. ==References== ==See also== * City University Construction Fund * Empire State Development Corporation * New York State Environmental Facilities Corporation * State University Construction Fund ==External links== * * Dormitory Authority Act * Facilities Development Corporation Act * New York State Medical Care Facilities Finance Agency Act * Dataset: DASNY (Dormitory Authority of the State of New York) Bonds and Notes: Beginning 1957 Category:Public benefit corporations in New York (state) Category:1944 establishments in New York (state) ","title":"Dormitory Authority of the State of New York"},{"id":"9115809","text":"On this 16-century chart of Goes, \\"Zeer Henriks kinderen\\" appears in the bottom left corner. ‚Äå's-Heer Hendrikskinderen is a village in the Dutch province of Zeeland.

The chemical \\"is always used in conjunction with antimony trioxide\\" in polymers, mainly in \\"high impact polystyrene (HIPS) which is used in the television industry for cabinet backs.\\" DecaBDE is also used for \\"polypropylene drapery and upholstery fabric\\" by means of backcoating and \\"may also be used in some synthetic carpets.\\" The annual demand worldwide was estimated as 56,100 tonnes in 2001, of which the Americas accounted for 24,500 tonnes, Asia 23,000 tonnes, and Europe 7,600 tonnes. In 2012 between 2500 and 5000 metric tonnes of Deca-BDE was sold in Europe. As of 2007, Albemarle in the U.S., Chemtura in the U.S., ICL-IP in Israel, and Tosoh Corporation in Japan are the main manufacturers of DecaBDE.Brominated Flame Retardants: Third annual report to the Maine Legislature. Augusta, Maine: Maine Department of Environmental Protection and Maine Center for Disease Control & Prevention, January 2007. ==Environmental chemistry== As stated in a 2006 review, \\"Deca-BDE has long been characterized as an environmentally stable and inert product that was not capable of degradation in the environment, not toxic, and therefore of no concern.\\" However, \\"some scientists had not particularly believed that Deca-BDE was so benign, particularly as evidence to this effect came largely from the industry itself.\\" One problem in studying the chemical was that \\"the detection of Deca- BDE in environmental samples is difficult and problematic\\"; only in the late 1990s did \\"analytical advances... allow[] detection at much lower concentrations.\\" DecaBDE is released by different processes into the environment, such as emissions from manufacture of decaBDE-containing products and from the products themselves. Elevated concentrations can be found in air, water, soil, food, sediment, sludge, and dust. A 2006 study concluded \\"in general, environmental concentrations of BDE-209 [i.e., decaBDE] appear to be increasing.\\" ===The question of debromination=== An important scientific issue is whether decaBDE debrominates in the environment to PBDE congeners with fewer bromine atoms, since such PBDE congeners may be more toxic than decaBDE itself. Debromination may be \\"biotic\\" (caused by biological means) or \\"abiotic\\" (caused by nonbiological means). The European Union (EU) in May 2004 stated \\"the formation of PBT/vPvB (Persistent, Bioaccumulative, and Toxic / very Persistent, very Bioaccumulative) substances in the environment as a result of degradation [of decaBDE] is a possibility that cannot be quantified based on current knowledge.\\" In September 2004 an Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) report asserted that \\"DecaBDE seems to be largely resistant to environmental degradation.\\" In May 2006, the EPHA Environment Network (now The Health and Environment Alliance) released a report reviewing the available scientific literatureStapleton, Heather M.

However, in cars debromination can be expected to occur more significantly.\\" * \\"In sewage anaerobic bacteria can initiate debromination of BDE 209, albeit at a slower rate than photolytic debromination, but due to the large volumes of DecaBDE in sewage sludge this may be significant.\\" * \\"Some fish appear capable of debrominating BDE 209 through metabolism. The extent of the metabolism varies among fish and it is difficult to determine the extent of debromination that would occur in the wild.\\" Subsequently, many studies have been published concerning decaBDE debromination. Common anaerobic soil bacteria debrominated decaBDE and octaBDE in a 2006 study. In 2006-2007 studies, metabolic debromination of decaBDE was demonstrated in fish, birds, cows, and rats. A 2007 study by La Guardia and colleagues measured PBDE congeners \\"from a wastewater treatment plant (sludge) to receiving stream sediments and associated aquatic biota\\"; it \\"support[ed] the hypothesis that metabolic debromination of -209 [i.e., decaBDE] does occur in the aquatic environment under realistic conditions.\\" In another 2007 study, Stapleton and Dodder exposed \\"both a natural and a BDE 209 spiked [house] dust material\\" to sunlight, and found \\"nonabrominated congeners\\" and \\"octabrominated congeners\\" consistent with debromination of decaBDE in the environment. In March 2007 the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency concluded \\"it can be questioned how much abiotic and microbial degradation [of decaBDE] occurs under normal environmental conditions, and it is not clear whether the more toxic lower- brominated PBDEs are produced in significant quantities by any of these pathways.\\"Illinois Environmental Protection Agency. Report on Alternatives to the Flame Retardant DecaBDE: Evaluation of Toxicity, Availability, Affordability, and Fire Safety Issues. March 2007. In September 2010, the UK Advisory Committee on Hazardous Substances issued an opinion that ‚Äòthere is strong but incomplete, scientific evidence indicating that Deca-BDE has the potential to undergo transformation to lower brominated congeners in the environment'.Advisory Committee on Hazardous Substances. ACHS opinion on the Draft Environmental Risk Assessment Report for Decabromodiphenyl ether (DecaBDE) (CAS 1163 19 5). Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs http://archive.defra.gov.uk/environment/quality/chemicals/achs/documents/achs- decaBDE-opinion-100923.pdf ==Pharmacokinetics== Exposure to decaBDE is thought to occur by means of ingestion. Humans and animals do not absorb decaBDE well; at most, perhaps 2% of an oral dose is absorbed.Voluntary Children‚Äôs Chemical Evaluation Program (VCCEP) Data Summary: Decabromodiphenyl Ether (a.k.a. Decabromodiphenyl Oxide, DBDPO) CAS # 1163-19-5. American Chemistry Council‚Äôs Brominated Flame Retardant Industry Panel (BFRIP), December 17, 2002.Report of the Peer Consultation Meeting On Decabromodiphenyl Ether. American Chemistry Council‚Äôs Brominated Flame Retardant Industry Panel for the Voluntary Children's Chemical Evaluation Program (VCCEP), September 30, 2003. It is believed that \\"the small amount of decaBDE that is absorbed can be metabolized\\". Once in the body, decaBDE \\"might leave unchanged or as metabolites, mainly in the feces and in very small amounts in the urine, within a few days,\\" in contrast with \\"lower brominated PBDEs... [which] might stay in your body for many years, stored mainly in body fat.\\" In workers with occupational exposure to PBDEs, the calculated apparent half-life for decaBDE was 15 days, as opposed to (for example) an octaBDE congener with a half-life of 91 days. ===Detection in humans=== In the general population, decaBDE has been found in blood and breast milk, but at lower levels than other PBDE congeners such as 47, 99, and 153. An investigation carried out by the WWF detected decaBDE in blood samples from 3 of 14 ministers of health and environment of European Union countries, while (for example) PBDE-153 was found in all 14.WWF Detox Campaign. Bad Blood? A Survey of Chemicals in the Blood of European Ministers. October 2004. ==Possible health effects in humans== In 2004, ATSDR wrote \\"Nothing definite is known about the health effects of PBDEs in people. Practically all of the available information is from studies of laboratory animals. Animal studies indicate that commercial decaBDE mixtures are generally much less toxic than the products containing lower brominated PBDEs. Because of its very different toxicity, decaBDE is expected to have relatively little effect on the health of humans.\\" Based on animal studies, the possible health effects of decaBDE in humans involve the liver, thyroid, reproductive/developmental effects, and neurological effects.Illinois Environmental Protection Agency. DecaBDE Study: A Review of Available Scientific Research. January 2006. ===Liver=== ATSDR stated in 2004 \\"We don‚Äôt know if PBDEs can cause cancer in people, although liver tumors developed in rats and mice that ate extremely large amounts of decaBDE throughout their lifetime. On the basis of evidence for cancer in animals, decaBDE is classified as a possible human carcinogen by EPA [i.e., the United States Environmental Protection Agency ].\\" ===Thyroid=== One 2006 review concluded \\"Decreases in thyroid hormone levels have been reported in several studies, and thyroid gland enlargement (an early sign of hypothyroidism) has been shown in studies of longer duration exposure.\\" A 2007 experiment giving decaBDE to pregnant mice found that decaBDE \\"is likely an endocrine disrupter in male mice following exposure during development\\" based on results such as decreased serum triiodothyronine. ===Reproductive/developmental effects=== \\"Significant data gaps\\" exist in the scientific literature on a possible relationship between decaBDE and reproductive/developmental effects. A 2006 study of mice found that decaBDE decreased some \\"sperm functions.\\" ===Neurological effects=== EPA has determined that daily Deca exposures should be less than 7 Œºg/kg-d (micrograms per kilogram bodyweight per day) to minimize the chance of brain and nervous system toxicity.EPA. 2008. Final Integrated Risk Information System Assessment for Decabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-209). Available: http://www.epa.gov/ncea/iris/subst/0035.htm EPA based their assessment on a study in 2003 on neurotoxicity in mice, which some have \\"criticized for certain procedural and statistical problems.\\" A 2007 study in mice \\"suggest[ed] that decaBDE is a developmental neurotoxicant that can produce long-term behavioral changes following a discrete period of neonatal exposure.\\" Administration of decaBDE to male rats at 3 days of age in another 2007 study \\"was shown to disrupt normal spontaneous behaviour at 2 months of age.\\" ==Overall risks and benefits== In 2002‚Äì2003 the American Chemistry Council's Brominated Flame Retardant Industry Panel, citing an unpublished 1997 study, estimated that 280 deaths due to fires are prevented each year in the U.S. because of the use of decaBDE. The industry advocacy group American Council on Science and Health, in a 2006 report largely concerning decaBDE, said that \\"the benefits of PBDE flame retardants, in terms of lives saved and injuries prevented, far outweigh any demonstrated or likely negative health effects from their use.\\"Kucewicz, William P. Brominated Flame Retardants: A Burning Issue. New York: American Council on Science and Health, August 2006. A 2006 study concluded \\"current levels of Deca in the United States are unlikely to represent an adverse health risk for children.\\" A report from the Swedish National Testing and Research Institute concerning the costs and benefits of decaBDE in television sets that was funded by BSEF assumed \\"no cost for injuries (either to humans or the environment) due to exposure to flame retardants... as there was no indication that such costs exist for DecaBDE\\"; it found that decaBDE's benefits exceeded its costs.Simonson, Margaret, et al. Cost Benefit Analysis Model for Fire Safety Methodology and TV (DecaBDE) Case Study. Swedish National Testing and Research Institute, SP Report 2006:28. ==Voluntary and governmental actionsEurope=== In Germany, plastics manufacturers and the textile additives industry \\"declared in 1986 a voluntary phase-out of the use of PBDEs, including Deca-BDE.\\"Lassen, Carsten, et al. Deca-BDE and Alternatives in Electrical and Electronic Equipment. Danish Environmental Protection Agency, 2006. Although decaBDE was to be phased out of electrical and electronic equipment in the EU by 2006 under the EU's Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive (RoHS), decaBDE use has been exempted from RoHS during 2005‚Äì2010. COMMISSION DECISION of 13 October 2005 amending for the purposes of adapting to the technical progress the Annex to Directive 2002/95/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment (2005/717/EC).

Official Journal of the European Union 24.09.2010.Washington State Departments of Health and Ecology. Developments within the European Union Regarding Deca-BDE as Interpreted by Health and Ecology Staff. October 12, 2005. A case in the European Court of Justice against the RoHS exemption was decided against Deca-BDE and its use must be phased out by July 1, 2008. Sweden, an EU member, banned decaBDE as of 2007.Stiffler, Lisa. PBDEs: They are everywhere, they accumulate and they spread. Seattle Post-Intelligencer, March 28, 2007. The former European Brominated Flame Retardant Industry Panel (EBFRIP), now merged with EFRA, the European Flame Retardant Association, stated that Sweden's ban on DecaBDE \\"was a serious breach of EU law. . The European Commission then started an infringement procedure against Sweden which lead to the Swedish Government repealing this restriction on 1 July 2008 . The environment agency of Norway, which is a member of the European Free Trade Association but is not a member of the EU, recommended that decaBDE be banned from electronic products in 2008.Norwegian Ban on Deca PBDE \\"\\" Norwegian Pollution Control Agency. DecaBDE has been the subject of a ten-year evaluation under the EU Risk Assessment procedure which has reviewed over 1100 studies. The Risk Assessment was published on the EU Official Journal in May 2008.Official Journal of the European Union: Communication from the Commission on the results of the risk evaluation of chlorodifluoromethane, bis(pentabromophenyl)ether and methenamine and on the risk reduction strategy for the substance methenamine, 29.5.2008 Deca was registered under the EU's REACH Regulation at the end of August 2010. The UK's Advisory Committee on Hazardous Substances (ACHS) presented their conclusions following a review of the emerging studies on Deca-BDE on 14 September 2010. On 5 July ECHA withdrew Deca-BDE from its list of priority substances for Authorisation under REACH, therefore closing the public consultation. On 1 August 2014, ECHA submitted a restriction proposal for Deca-BDE. The agency is proposing a restriction on the manufacture, use and placing on the market of the substance and of mixtures and articles containing it. On 17 September 2014, ECHA submitted the restriction report which initiates a six months public consultation. On 9 February 2017, the European Commission adopted Regulation EU 2017/227. Article 1 of this regulation states that Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 is amended to include a ban on the use of decaBDE in quantities greater than 0.1% by weight, effective from 2 March 2019. Products placed on the market prior to 2 March 2019 are exempt. Furthermore, the use decaBDE in aircraft is permissible until 2 March 2027. This EU process is running in parallel with a UNEP review to determine whether Deca-BDE should be listed as a Persistent Organic Pollutant (POP) under the Stockholm Convention. ===United States=== As of mid-2007 two states had instituted measures to phase out decaBDE. In April 2007 the state of Washington passed a law banning the manufacture, sale, and use of decaBDE in mattresses as of 2008; the ban \\"could be extended to TVs, computers and upholstered residential furniture in 2011 provided an alternative flame retardant is approved.\\"Stiffler, Lisa. Chemical ban puts industry on the defensive. Seattle Post-Intelligencer, April 16, 2007. In June 2007 the state of Maine passed a law \\"ban[ning] the use of deca-BDE in mattresses and furniture on January 1, 2008 and phas[ing] out its use in televisions and other plastic-cased electronics by January 1, 2010.\\"Maine Legislature votes to ban toxic Deca flame retardant.

The first building on the present site was erected in 1805 on land donated by Brabazon Newcomen. In 1860 a new church was built out of the foundations of the 1805 one. In 1961 major work was done on the church. The mortuary was built and the front door was set in. Wooden statues that were found under the altar during this renovation certainly came from Clontuskert Priory. They are now in the Diocesan Museum beside the Cathedral in Loughrea. All date back to 1200 to 1300 AD. Local Soccer Pitch, Sky valley Rovers St Ronan‚Äôs well is situated in the town land of Shraduff in Taughmaconnell.

Court St. in Paris, Illinois. The Classical Revival building was constructed in 1924. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. ==History== The hotel was constructed in 1924 to replace the old Paris Hotel, which was destroyed in a fire in 1918. The hotel's construction was sponsored by the Paris Chamber of Commerce and funded by the citizens of Paris; as most hotels of the era were built by private firms, this was considered unusual. The Chamber decided upon the site of the hotel in 1922 and chose the building's architect, but planning and construction delays pushed the project back into 1923. By September 1923, the Chamber had nearly exhausted its funds, and the hotel's contractor intended to place a lien on the hotel site if they could not find more money. The citizens of Paris responded by raising $191,000 in a fundraising effort, providing the necessary funds to complete the hotel. Paris was a major railroad junction in the 1920s, as three major rail lines passed through the city. In addition, as Paris was the county seat of Edgar County, it served as the center for county administration and business activities. The hotel therefore became an important meeting place for Edgar County's citizens and travelers through Paris. Visitors considered the France Hotel to have more modern facilities than any other Paris hotel; these facilities included warm and cold running water, an elevator, and bathrooms in each room. In addition, the hotel included amenities and business such as a barber shop, beauty parlor, coffee shop, banquet hall, and private dining rooms, which served local residents as well as visitors. The France Hotel was added to the National Register of Historic Places on August 3, 1987. The Paris Elks Lodge No. 812 Building, which borders the hotel to the south, was added to the National Register at the same time. ==Architecture== Architect Ewing Miller, Sr., of the Fort Wayne, Indiana, architectural firm Johnson, Miller & Miller, designed the hotel in the Classical Revival style. The four-story building was built in red brick and uses Bedford limestone in many of its decorations. The building's entrance is set in smooth limestone and is topped by an arched stone decoration resembling a fanlight. A pair of French doors are located on either side of the entrance; each set of doors is topped by a wooden pediment and stone arches. The upper stories of the building each have six bays of windows; the center two bays are surrounded by vertical courses of limestone, with decorative stone pediments topping the third-floor windows. An architrave is situated above the fourth-floor windows; the architrave is topped by a brick frieze with limestone roundels, which is itself topped by a cornice and parapet roofline. Stone urns rest atop the corners and center of the roofline. ==Notes== Category:Buildings and structures in Edgar County, Illinois Category:National Register of Historic Places in Edgar County, Illinois Category:Hotel buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Illinois Category:Neoclassical architecture in Illinois ","title":"France Hotel"},{"id":"9116064","text":"Pi2 Cygni, Latinized from œÄ2 Cygni, is a triple star system in the northern constellation of Cygnus.

His highest rank was komusubi. ==Career== He was a premature baby, and had to spend more than a year and a half in an incubator. Chiyotenzan made his professional debut in March 1991, joining the Kokonoe stable that was then home to yokozuna Chiyonofuji and Hokutoumi. He reached the second highest j≈´ry≈ç division in January 1997, and the top makuuchi division two years after that. He had an explosive start to his makuuchi career, winning three special prizes in his first three tournaments (the first wrestler ever to do so) and reaching the fourth highest rank of komusubi in July 1999. However, that was to be his only tournament in the top ranks and his initial promise quickly faded. His last winning score in the top division came in November 2001 and after suffering a fractured leg in the January 2002 tournament he fell back to j≈´ry≈ç in July 2002. Hampered by diabetes, his fortunes slumped even further. After making a final appearance in the sekitori ranks in November 2005, in January 2006 he was demoted to the unsalaried makushita division, and in May 2007, to the fourth sandanme division. He reappeared in makushita in September 2007, but won only one match before withdrawing. By November he had fallen to sandanme 27, the second lowest rank ever held by a former sanyaku wrestler. ==Retirement from sumo== After losing his first bout in the January 2008 tournament, Chiyotenzan announced his retirement. He was unable to obtain an elder position in the Japan Sumo Association and has left the sumo world completely. ==Fighting style== Chiyotenzan's favoured kimarite or techniques were migi-yotsu (a left hand outside, right hand inside grip on the opponent's mawashi), yori kiri (force out) and uwatenage (overarm throw). ==Career record== ==See also== *List of sumo tournament second division champions *Glossary of sumo terms *List of past sumo wrestlers *List of komusubi ==References== ==External links== * Category:1976 births Category:Living people Category:Japanese sumo wrestlers Category:People from Osaka Category:Sumo people from Osaka Prefecture Category:Komusubi Category:Kokonoe stable sumo wrestlers ","title":"Chiyotenzan Daihachir≈ç"},{"id":"9116078","text":"Ut√∏y or Ut√∏ya is a village area in the municipality of Inder√∏y in Tr√∏ndelag county, Norway.

He was born in Worcester, Massachusetts as the son of William John D'Ewart and Mary Elizabeth Barnard. He attended Washington State College at Pullman and moved to Montana, where he settled in Park County, working as a businessman. From 1937 to 1939, he served in the Montana House of Representatives, and from 1941 to 1945, he served in the Montana Senate. When United States Congressman James F. O'Connor, who represented Montana's 2nd congressional district died on January 15, 1945, a special election was held to replace him, which D'Ewart won. He was re-elected in 1946 against Democratic nominee John J. Holmes by a wide margin, and in 1948, he defeated Willard E. Fraser to narrowly win re-election. D'Ewart was re-elected in 1950 and 1952 against John J. Holmes. Rather than seek re-election, D'Ewart ran for the United States Senate against incumbent Democratic Senator James E. Murray in 1954. Following a close and contentious election, Murray narrowly defeated D'Ewart to win his final term in the Senate. D'Ewart served as an assistant to the United States Secretary of Agriculture from January 1955 to September 1955. He was Assistant Secretary of the Department of the Interior from October 1955 to July 1956. From August 1956 to October 1958 he was a special representative for the Secretary of Agriculture. When incumbent Governor J. Hugo Aronson declined to seek reelection as Governor of Montana in 1960, D'Ewart ran to succeed him, and lost to former State Senator Donald Grant Nutter in the Republican primary by fewer than five hundred votes.

A right- hand opening batsman for Trinidad and Tobago, Barath made his Test debut in November 2009, becoming the youngest West Indian to score a century. He played his first One Day International (ODI) in March the following year. He is also the second youngest West Indian to have scored a century in first-class cricket, after Bruce Pairaudeau. He played for Kings XI Punjab in the Indian premier league. ==Career== A prot√©g√© of Brian Lara, Barath became the youngest West Indian player to make his first-class debut since Ramnaresh Sarwan when he first appeared for Trinidad and Tobago at 16. In his debut match, Barath scored 73 against Guyana and put on a 170 runs partnership with captain Daren Ganga. This gave them the record for Trinidad and Tobago highest opening partnership in first-class cricket. Barath scored his maiden century in his second match. He became the youngest player in the Caribbean to score a century in first-class cricket since Bruce Pairaudeau in 1947, and he followed that up with a second century in the next game. Barath was part of the West Indies U-19 team for the 2008 World Cup played for the West Indies A team against the touring England side in January 2009, making 132. During the Airtel Champions League Twenty20 2009, Barath made his T20 debut for Trinidad and Tobago against Diamond Eagles where he made 63 runs off 41 deliveries. He made his Test debut for the West Indies against Australia at the Gabba on 26 November 2009. He fell early in the first innings with a score of 15 but led the West Indies in the second innings scoring 104 runs when following on. He became the first West Indian to score a century on debut since Dwayne Smith. At the age of 19, he is also the youngest ever West Indian player to score a Test century, having taken over from George Headley. Though initially included in the West Indies' 15-man squad for the 2011 World Cup, Barath suffered an injury to his right hamstring and was unable to play in the tournament. As a consequence he was replaced by Devon Smith. Initially, he was expected to take three weeks to recover, however two months later he was still unable to play. Barath returned to the West Indies side for the last of five ODIs against India in June. A three-Test series followed and Barath replaced Kraigg Brathwaite as opener. Though he had played in the Trinidad & Tobago Twenty20 Festival, Barath struggled during the Test series, looking out of practice and edging to the slips. He scored 150 runs from six innings. The West Indies toured Bangladesh in October 2011 and during the opening ODI Barath incurred an injury to his hamstring and did not play again during the tour and was replaced by the in-form Lendl Simmons. Barath recovered in time to be selected for the squad to tour India the following month, taking over from Simmons who was omitted. He scored 17 runs from two ODIs, but was more successful in the Test series, managing 128 runs including two half-centuries from two matches including two half-centuries. Injury forced batsman Shivnarine Chanderpaul to miss the third and final Test, and it had been anticipated that without his influence the inexperienced West Indian batting line up might struggle. In the event, Barath opened the batting with Braithwaite and the pair put on a 137-run opening stand in the first innings, the West Indies' highest partnership for the first wicket since 2006. Australia toured the West Indies for five ODIs and three Tests beginning in March 2012. A finger injury forced Barath to miss the first three ODIs, but having proved his fitness by scoring 114 for Trinidad and Tobago against Guyana in the Regional Four Day Competition was called up for the final two matches, replacing fellow opener Kieran Powell who had scored twenty runs from three matches. Playing in all three Tests, Barath managed 65 runs. Barath was not alone in struggling against Australia's bowlers, and captain Darren Sammy remarked \\"Stats don't lie. Our top order did not click against Australia, but the selectors have shown faith in two of them [Adrian Barath and Kieran Powell]. They are quite young, they are still learning on the job. Yes, they will fail sometimes. But there is one thing we won't do and that is give in.\\" In May 2012 the West Indies embarked on a tour of England. The top three consisted of Barath, Powell, and Kirk Edwards entered the series out of form and with little experience of English conditions and were expected to struggle. Between January 2008 and May 2012 West Indies average for their opening partnership of 28.83 was the second lowest of all ten Test teams. ==Notes== ==External links== * Category:1990 births Category:Living people Category:West Indies Test cricketers Category:Cricketers who made a century on Test debut Category:West Indies One Day International cricketers Category:West Indies Twenty20 International cricketers Category:Trinidad and Tobago cricketers Category:Kings XI Punjab cricketers Category:Cricketers at the 2011 Cricket World Cup Category:Trinbago Knight Riders cricketers ","title":"Adrian Barath"},{"id":"9116161","text":"Coptis quinquesecta is a species of goldthread native to Jinping County, Yunnan, China and locally in northern Vietnam.

Harle, 49, 166, 276. Harle restricts use of candra≈õƒÅlƒÅ to examples from the Gupta period, when contemporary texts use that term. are the terms most often used to describe the motif centred on an ogee, circular or horseshoe arch that decorates many examples of Indian rock-cut architecture and later Indian structural temples and other buildings. In its original form, the arch is shaped like the cross- section of a barrel vault. It is called a chaitya arch when used on the facade of a chaitya hall, around the single large window. In later forms it develops well beyond this type, and becomes a very flexible unit, \\"the most common motif of Hindu temple architecture\\".Harle, 48 GavƒÅk·π£ha (or gavaksa) is a Sanskrit word which means \\"bull's or cow's eye\\". In Hindu temples, their role is envisioned as symbolically radiating the light and splendour of the central icon in its sanctum. Alternatively, they are described as providing a window for the deity to gaze out into the world.Elgood (2000), 103 Like the whole of the classic chaitya, the form originated in the shape of the wooden thatched roofs of buildings, none of which have survived; the earliest version replicating such roofs in stone is at the entrance to the non-Buddhist Lomas Rishi Cave, one of the man-made Barabar Caves in Bihar.Harle, 48; Michell, 217‚Äì218 The \\"chaitya arch\\" around the large window above the entrance frequently appears repeated as a small motif in decoration, and evolved versions continue into Hindu decoration, long after actual chaityas had ceased to be built.Harle, 48 In these cases it can become an elaborate cartouche-like frame, spreading rather wide, around a circular or semi-circular medallion, which may contain a sculpture of a figure or head. An early stage is shown in the entrance to Cave 9 at the Ajanta Caves, where the chaitya arch window frame is repeated several times as a decorative motif. Here, and in many similar early examples, the interior of the arch in the motif contains low relief lattice imitating receding roof timbers (purlins). ==First stage== The city of Kusinagara in the War over the Buddha's Relics, South Gate, Stupa no. 1, Sanchi. The arched gable-end form seen at the Lomas Rishi Cave and other sites appears as a feature of both sacred and secular buildings represented in reliefs from early Buddhist sites in India, and was evidently widely used for roofs made from plant materials in ancient Indian architecture.Hardy, 38; Harle, 43‚Äì48 Simple versions of similar structures remain in use today by the Toda people of the Nilgiri Hills.Gowans, Alan. The Art Bulletin, vol. 38, no. 2, 1956, pp. 127‚Äì129, [www.jstor.org/stable/3047649 JSTOR] (Review of Zimmer) The rock-cut Lomas Rishi Cave was excavated during the reign of Ashoka in the Maurya Empire in the 3rd century BC, for the Ajivikas, a non-Buddhist religious and philosophical group of the period. A band below the arch contains a lattice in relief, presumably representing the ceiling of a thatched roof. Below that is a curved relief of a line of elephants. The entrance leads into the side of the hall, so unlike most later window frame examples, the arch bears no great relationship to the space it leads into. The immediately neighbouring cave in the same rock face has a plain undecorated recess at the entrance, which originally may have held a porch of similar design in plant materials.Harle, 48; Michell, 217‚Äì218 Piled-up gavakshas at Osian, Jodhpur Early rock-cut chaitya halls use the same ogee shape for the main window needed to illuminate the interior, and often also have small relief window motifs as decoration. In these the inside of the arch has a series of square-ended projections representing the joists, and inside that a curving lattice in low relief that represents the receding roof timbers of the inside of a notional building. At the bottom, a small area, more or less semi- circular, represents the far wall of the structure, and may be plain (e.g. Bhaja Caves over side galleries), show a different lattice pattern (e.g. Bhaja Caves main front), Pandavleni Caves cave 18, above), or a decorative motif (e.g. Cave 9, Ajanta, Pandavleni Caves cave 18, over doorway). Often the areas around these window or gable motifs have bands of latticework, apparently representing lattice railings, similar to those shown edging the balconies and loggias of the fort-palace in the relief of Kusinagara in the War over the Buddha's Relics, South Gate, Stupa no. 1, Sanchi. This is especially the case at the Bedse Caves,Harle, 48, 54 in an early example of what James Fergusson noted in the nineteenth century: \\"Everywhere ... in India architectural decoration is made up of small models of large buildings\\".Quoted in Hardy, 18 At the entrance to Cave 19 at Ajanta, four horizontal zones of the decoration use repeated \\"chaitya arch\\" motifs on an otherwise plain band (two on the projecting porch, and two above). There is a head inside each arch. Early examples include Ellora Caves 10, Ajanta Caves 9 and 19 and Varaha Cave Temple at Mamallapuram.Harle, 276 File:Conjectural reconstruction of the main gate of Kusinagara circa 500 BCE adapted from a relief at Sanchi.jpgConjectural reconstruction of the main gate of Kusinagara circa 500 BCE adapted from this relief at Sanchi.

The main window is smaller, and now bears no relation to the roof inside (which still has the traditional ribs). It has only two of the traditional projections imitating purlin beam-ends, and a wide decorative frame that spreads over several times the width of the actual window opening. Two doors to the sides have pediments with \\"split and superimposed\\" blind gavakshas, also with wide frames. This was to be the style of gavaksha that had already been widely adopted for the decoration of Hindu and Jain temples, and is seen in simplified form in the Buddhist Mahabodhi Temple at Bodh Gaya, and the Hindu Dashavatara Temple, Deogarh.Harle, 112, 132, 201; Hardy, 40 Also in the 7th century, the sukanasa developed. This is a very large developed gavaksha motif fixed on the outside of the temple tower over its entrance, normally standing vertical, although the tower slopes inwards.Kramrisch, 240‚Äì241; Harle, 140 By the end of the 7th century, and perhaps earlier, the entire faces of large shikhara towers or other surfaces could be taken up by grids of interlocking gavaksha motifs, often called \\"gavaksha mesh\\" or honeycomb.Harle, 134, 140 Early examples include the Buddhist shikhara tower at the Mahabodhi Temple, Bodh Gaya, where the motifs cover most of the surface but do not actually interlock. This is of the 6th century at the latest, but perhaps restoring a design of as early as the 2nd or 3rd century.Harle, 201 Cave 15 at Ellora, complete by 730 if not before, and perhaps begun as a Buddhist excavation, may be one of the earliest examples of the full style.Harle, 134 The motif spread to South India, for example the 7th and 8th century temples at Pattadakal in Karnataka. Gop Temple in Gujarat, probably from the 6th century, is the largest and finest of a group of early temples in a distinct local style. The bare castle-like appearance of the central square tower today probably does not reflect the original design, as the upper parts of the structure around it are missing. Above the plain walls the sloping top includes three large gavakshas on each face, two below and one above, which are unusual in actually being open, rather than in shallow relief, like almost all later gavakshas. Originally statues stood behind them, of which very little now remains.Harle, 136‚Äì138 Gavakshas are prominent in some temples of the 8th century group on the Dieng plateau in central Java, among the earliest monumental Hindu temples in modern Indonesia.Michell (1988), 160‚Äì161 ==NƒÅsƒ´s of the south== Adam Hardy distinguishes between the gavaksha, which he largely restricts to the Nagara architecture of the north, and its cousin in the Dravidian architecture of the south, the nƒÅsƒ´ (\\"kudu\\" in Tamil). He allows an early period of \\"gradual differentiation\\" as the nƒÅsƒ´ evolves from the gavaksha, the first to appear. In a detailed analysis of the parts of the motif, he points to several differences of form. Among other characteristics of the nƒÅsƒ´, the motif has no frame at the base, the interior of the window is often blank (perhaps originally painted), and there is often a kirtimukha head at the top of the motif. In general, the form is less linear, and more heavily ornamented.Hardy, 101‚Äì103 File:Gop Sun temple Zinavari Gujarat roof north.jpgNorth roof of Gop Surya temple, Gujarat, c. late 6th / early 7th century File:Osian 16-15.jpgTwo chaitya arch motifs on top of each other.

He remained there until the mid-1850s at which time he removed to Port Franks, Ontario and became the first postmaster there. During his short tenure at Port Franks he became embroiled in local politics and some serious financial reverses which resulted in him serving time in debtors' prison in Sarnia. Upon his release he secured a position as teacher in Warwick, Ontario in Lambton County, and then removed to Oil Springs in 1862.

The group formed in the mid-'90s, centered on the brotherly team of bassist Bill Scoville and guitarist Mike Scoville, along with guitarist Matt Wood and drummer Derrick Van Wie. With their original singer, they crafted a CD EP for Trainwreck Records, but it was with energetic frontman Rob Fusco, and Equal Vision Records (for whom Bill worked for a number of years), that One King Down really made their mark on the international hardcore punk scene. The diminutive Fusco's growl and lyrical espousing of the vegan straight-edge lifestyle (not all of the band's members were vegans, or even vegetarians, but they were all drug-free) garnered them attention from all over the U.S. and Europe. Coupled with the band's stop-and-go rhythms and dancefloor-moving heavy groove, Fusco's vocals were put to tape for the Bloodlust Revenge EP, released by Equal Vision in 1997 and still regarded by most fans as the band's finest recorded hour. The group toured with Erie, PA's Brothers Keeper and other bands, selling several thousand copies of the record at shows and through major independent distribution channels. They also released a split EP with Spirit of Youth through Europe's Good Life Recordings. Internal friction caused the ousting of Fusco shortly before the band was to embark on a national tour supporting Earth Crisis and Madball, to be followed by another trek with Hatebreed. One King Down scrambled to find a replacement, inviting then Burn It Down vocalist Ryan Downey to fill in for them. This union only lasted for two shows before the singer-less One King Down returned home to regroup. Eventually, they teamed up with Syracuse native Jon Peters, who lent his vocals to the band's debut full-length album, 1998's God Loves, Man Kills. After subsequent touring, Peters left the band and they split up for a short time. Mike Scoville auditioned for the Foo Fighters, but the job ultimately went to someone else. One King Down re-formed and Fusco was eventually invited to rejoin. They played a few shows before Van Wie left the group, with Wood switching to drum duties as the Albany band pared down to a four-piece. One King Down released the Gravity Wins Again EP in 2000, a collection of newly penned songs together with older, previously recorded tracks. In 2001, after skipping an appearance at Syracuse, NY's Hellfest, it appeared that the band was done once and for all. In March 2018, it was announced that they would play at This is Hardcore 2018 in July, their first show in over 17 years. In October 2018, they played in their home state once again, in the Albany area at the Upstate Concert Hall. ==Members== *Rob Fusco - vocals *Michael Scoville - guitar *Bill Scoville - bass *Derrick Vanwie - drums *Matt Wood - guitar *Bill Brown - vocals *Jon Peters - vocals ==Discography== *Jawbreaker Demo Cassette (1994, Self-Released) *Absolve CDep (1995, Trainwreck Records) *Bloodlust Revenge (1997, Equal Vision Records) *God Loves, Man Kills CD/12\\" (1998, Equal Vision Records) *Gravity Wins Again 7\\"/CD (2000, Equal Vision Records - CD version contains Absolve) *Rob Loves, Man Kills Demo CDr (2006, Unreleased) *Split - One King Down/Spirit of Youth Split CD (1998, Good Life Recordings) *Split - When Angles Shed Their Wings Volume 2 7\\" (2001, Devil's Head Records) *Split - One King Down/Mindsnare/Day of Contempt Split 7\\" (2001 Trial & Error Records) *V/A - City Rockers: A Tribute to the Clash (1999, Chord Records) ==References== ==External links== *Equal Vision Records page Equal Vision Records page *One King Downs official myspace page One King Downs official myspace page Category:Straight edge groups Category:Equal Vision Records artists Category:Hardcore punk groups from New York (state) Category:American metalcore musical groups ","title":"One King Down"},{"id":"9116296","text":"Na Muean (, ) is a district (amphoe) in the southern part of Nan Province, northern Thailand. ==History== The minor district (king amphoe) Na Muean was established on 9 October 1978 as a subordinate of Na Noi District, from which it was split off.nakornnan.com Originally it consisted of the three tambons, Na Thanung, Bo Kaeo, and Mueang Li.

Gender neutrality in languages with grammatical gender is, in the context of a language having grammatical gender categories, the usage of wording that is balanced in its treatment of the genders in a non-grammatical sense. For example, advocates of gender-neutral language challenge the traditional use of masculine nouns and pronouns (e.g. \\"he\\") when referring to two or more genders or to a person or people of an unknown gender in most Indo-European and Afro-Asiatic languages, often inspired by feminist ideas about gender equality. Gender neutrality is also used when one wishes to be inclusive of people who identify as non-binary genders or as genderless. == Overview == The situation of gender-neutral language modification in languages that have (at least) masculine and feminine grammatical genders, such as French, German, Greek and Spanish, is very different from that of English, because it is often impossible to construct a gender-neutral sentence as can be done in English. For example, in French, the masculine gender supersedes the feminine; the phrase (the woman and the man) is replaced by the pronoun (they [masculine]). In German, the plural is similar to the feminine singular ‚Äì is the plural form for both masculine and feminine, and the feminine singular article. Furthermore, , with a capital S, is used as the polite, honorific form of you in a formal context. Accordingly, language modification advocates have focused much of their attention on issues such as job titles. Due to the presence of grammatical gender, their immediate goal in this case is often the exact opposite of that in English: feminine job titles rather than eliminating them. As such, \\"gender-inclusiveness\\" does not necessarily mean eliminating gender, but rather a use of language which they feel is balanced in its treatment of only two genders. For example, they feel that it is insulting to use the masculine gender for a female professional, for example calling a woman (the [male] doctor). They feel this would imply that women change gender or became somehow more manly when they go to work. The creation of new job titles for women is often less controversial than language modifications proposed by advocates of gender-neutral language for English, as it is often seen simply as a natural evolution as women have entered more professions‚Äînot only having a title for being the \\"wife of a professional\\" which often has been the case historically. At the same time, the newer feminine forms in most such languages are usually derived from the primary masculine term by adding or changing a suffix (such as the German from , engineer), so some feminists hold that these words are not equivalent to the masculine words because they are secondary forms. Others object to the perceived clumsiness of such neologisms. Citing German as an example, almost all the names for female professionals end in , and because of the suffix none can consist of a single syllable as some masculine job titles do (such as , doctor). But a few times the female form is employed for both sexes, like in \\"male nurse\\", \\"male midwife\\" in several languages. And in few cases the male form is derived from the female, as in words for \\"widow/widower\\", \\"whore/manwhore\\" etc. A further complication is that the creation of distinctly different job titles for men and women means that in writing about hypothetical people of undetermined gender, both words must be mentioned each time, which can become quite cumbersome, or one of the titles must be accepted as genderless which is inherently unfair. In languages where the gender of a noun also affects the formation of other words in a sentence, such as gender- marked adjectives, pronouns, or verbs, this can lead to repetitive or complicated sentences if both terms are used, as the sentence must essentially be repeated twice. But in some languages, for example in Spanish, there have also been campaigns against the traditional use of the masculine gender to refer to mixed gender groups. Advocates of these changes feel that they are necessary in order for the language to not further the subordination of women. These modification efforts have been much more controversial. In addition to the sorts of conflict seen in the English-speaking world, some opponents of these changes see them as examples of cultural imperialism, or the exporting of Anglo-Saxon ideas and standards. English had already naturally lost most of its grammatical gender well before the beginning of the feminist movement, making a gender-neutral modification of the language much more feasible. Finnish has no gender markers in the language, but has no more of feminist or LGBTQ activism than Israel (history), with a language where gender is central, thus such mentioned correlation is not seen. == Hebrew == In Hebrew, which has a high degree of grammatical gender, virtually every noun (as well as most verbs and pronouns of the second and third person) is either grammatically masculine or feminine. As a result of campaigns by advocates for employment equality or gender neutral language modification, laws have been passed in Israel that require job ads to be written in a form which explicitly proclaims that the job is offered for both males and females. The separator \\"/\\" is often used, for example , , , (\\"wanted\\", masculine and feminine, and \\"secretary\\" masculine and feminine, respectively). Certain 2nd and 3rd person feminine plural verb forms of earlier Hebrew have become archaic in modern Israeli Hebrew, so that the old masculine plural forms are now used for both masculine and feminine. == Greek == Modern Greek language maintains three genders: masculine, feminine, and neuter. First and second person pronouns are genderless, while third person ones in both singular and plural use different endings to distinguish among the three genders. Greek verbs, however, have six endings (three persons, two numbers) and personal pronouns are rarely used, thus ensuring gender neutrality when needed. Difficulties arise with nouns denoting professions. Those ending in () are identical for men and women, but those ending in () or () are masculine with corresponding feminine in (). Some nouns denoting professions have no feminine form at all. In such cases, the masculine forms are used for women as well using feminine articles. Most have colloquial feminine forms (which were normal during the Byzantine years) using the infix () or (). Examples, () with additional colloquial () ‚Äúthe doctor‚Äù, () ‚Äúthe actor / actress‚Äù (no colloquial feminine form in Greek), () ‚Äúthe athlete‚Äù, () with additional colloquial () ‚Äúdeputy, member of parliament‚Äù. The noun () ‚Äúhuman being, person‚Äù is masculine and when it is not known whether a man or a woman is referenced, masculine profession nouns or adjectives are used, unless it is important to the speaker to differentiate. == Germanic languages  German === German has third-person singular pronouns, which include: (grammatically male), (grammatically female), (grammatically neuter), (impersonal/indefinite), (impersonal) and (impersonal) in nominative case. is frequently used in general statements such as (\\"One is not permitted to park here\\"), similar to English indefinite \\"you\\". The indefinite pronoun is distinguished from the noun (capitalized and with double \\"n\\"), which means \\"male adult human\\". However, cannot easily be used to refer to a specific person of indeterminate gender. In modern times, (distinguished from noun/title ) is also rarely used to emphasize that the person referred to is female, for effect e.g. in advertisement for products aimed at women, and by feminists as the female counterpart to the pronoun . Feminist language- modification advocates feel that the traditional phraseology of the language reflects a domination of the masculine over the feminine, as they feel it does in many other languages. They object to certain set phrases where the masculine form usually comes first, such as \\"man and woman\\" (), and to the differential use of words like (which has since dropped out of common use, since the end of the 1980s). Grammatical gender is a primary topic of contention among gender-neutral language advocates. is a grammatically masculine word which means \\"human being\\" or \\"person\\", and is the traditional Germanic word used to mean this. Alternatives are, however, fairly widespread. means the \\"person\\", which by itself is not awkward or politically correct, and is grammatically feminine. Feminine job titles are usually created by adding to the grammatically masculine word in question. For example, the general grammatically masculine term for computer scientist is (singular or plural). This yields the feminine form (plural: ). As in other languages, the use of a suffix to mark the feminine form implies that the unmarked grammatically masculine form is the main form of the word. There is no universally accepted solution to the trade-off between inclusiveness and wordiness. As a result of campaigns by advocates of feminist language modification, many job advertisements are now formulated so as to explicitly include a grammatically male and a female word (). The option of repeating all terms in two gender forms is considered clumsy, and in the singular requires adjectives, articles, and pronouns to also be stated twice. As an alternative, the use of slashes or parenthesis is commonplace, as in , but this is considered visually ungainly and there is no consensus on how it is pronounced. Recently, another approach is to use a phrase such as in an introductory paragraph, but use only the simpler masculine form in the rest of the document, often with a disclaimer. In the 1990s, a form of contraction using a non-standard typographic convention called with capitalization inside the word started to be used (e.g., ; ). In some circles this is especially used to formulate written openings, such as (Dear colleagues). One obstacle to this form is that one cannot audibly distinguish between terms ( sounds the same as ). This is a non-standard solution for how to economically express a position of gender quality in one German word, with an expression that would otherwise require three words, and is not accepted by the Duden, but has achieved a certain level of penetration among some circles in Germany. Opponents of such modification consider the capitalized I in the middle of a word to be a corruption of the language. It is also not clear which gender declension the form is to be used with; sometimes all adjectival endings are likewise capitalized, such as for \\"each person\\" instead of (each grammatically female) or (each grammatically male). This form also tends to be associated with the political left, as it is often used by left-leaning newspapers, notably Die Tageszeitung and the Swiss weekly WOZ Die Wochenzeitung,WOZ Die Wochenzeitung and feminists. Since the 2010s, a form is sometimes used in academic and feminist circles in which an underscore (_) or an asterisk (*) is inserted just before the gender-specific suffix, as in \\"\\" or \\"\\" (\\"dear student\\"). This form, called (not to be confused with the English-language term \\"gender gap\\") or (\\"gender star\\") respectively, is meant to convey an \\"open space\\" for all gender identities, whether male, female or genderqueer. In spoken language, the underscore or asterisk is indicated by a glottal stop. Examples This sign, reading \\"Radfahrer absteigen\\" (Cyclists, dismount) has been amended with a to make it gender-neutral. The following examples show various approaches for how to express \\"We need an experienced computer scientist\\" in a gender-neutral manner. :Using only the \\"generic\\" masculine form: :. :Using both the masculine and the feminine form: :. :. :Using slashes: :. :. :Emphasizing the suffix (considered bad style, but sometimes used): :; :sometimes: . :Using the masculine form, with an indication that all officially recognised genders (male, female, diverse) are meant: :. :Using the Gendergap or the asterisk: :. :. Alternatives To avoid any of these variants, gender-neutral neologisms may be formed. Some university communities are replacing (grammatically masculine college student) and (female college student) with the nominalized participle , meaning \\"the studying person\\" (masculine with the \\"r\\", masculine or female without), which does not face quite as many problems with declension. Nominalizations of adjectives, participles and numbers do not distinguish gender when used in the plural, so (\\"Dear studying ones!\\") is entirely neutral. Terms like (teacher) are increasingly being replaced by abstract or collective nouns such as (teaching force; faculty) or (teach person). (waiter) and (waitress) are often transformed into (service): (\\"If you need anything, ask the service/help\\"). === Swedish === Like other Germanic languages, Swedish used to have three genders, masculine, feminine, and neuter, , which started to change in the 14th century. Then it was expanded with to encompass the inanimate , which is still seen in the 4 personal pronouns in 3rd person singular. Today, Swedish only uses two genders for classification of nouns, (neuter, \\"not either\\"), which uses the pronoun and indefinite article , and another formed from a merger of the masculine, feminine, and other of gender , known as (common gender, \\"not not either\\"), which uses the pronoun , article . Thus, and are in modern Swedish basically used for humans and known animals, when biological gender is of interest, and comprise the \\"natural gender\\". Dialectally, the three/four gender system nouns survive to some small extent. For instance, , \\"the clock\\" as an object is a common gender word, but when used to ask or tell the time, it is treated as feminine: (\\"What time is it?\\" lit. \\" is six o'clock\\"). This is, however, a colloquial/dialectal use of to refer to the clock‚Äîalthough possibly prevalent in speech, depending on local dialects and speech patterns, this phrase would unlikely appear in formal speech or writing‚Äîinstead, one would encounter simply . There are other similar examples of historical remnants, like about ships or in some poetic use, but otherwise it is archaic. Customarily, feminine pronouns are used when referring to two genders. The word 'person', , is feminine, so requires a feminine pronoun and adjectives. For example, a correct phrase is: (\\"Early man and tools\\"). By extension, when reference is made to an individual without specifying gender, e.g. 'the one who is applying', later pronouns and adjectives are feminine; the feminine subject is understood. The anglicization of Swedish in the late 20th century has made the usage of masculine pronouns to refer to unspecified genders more habitual, but it is still widely deprecated. To use inanimate (\\"it\\") about persons is possible, but generally seen as pejorative, except in gender neutral relative pronoun (\\"the one who\\"). In official documents, however, this locution has now been replaced with , \\"you who\\", which requires no specification of the gender of the person addressed Swedish adjectives are always (when possible) inflected in agreement with number and neutral gender, and they used to be inflected for grammatical case and masculine and feminine gender as well. The latter inflection‚Äî (m), (f)‚Äîhas not yet fallen completely into disuse, but the extent of its use is dialectal. Some still use it for occupational and kinship words, but the fact remains that it no longer serves any purpose for any other nouns. It is, though, used distinctively with adjectival nouns as in (\\"the old man\\") vs. (\\"the old woman\\"). This has caused some debate as to which gender inflection should be the standard one for all nouns. The feminine inflection has become the one most widely used throughout the country, most likely because it is more distinct before nouns that begin with a vowel than due to any wide sense of gender equality. One point is that the feminine form with be used always without regard to natural gender, while the form with is exclusive to masculine in standard Swedish. The case inflection is only found in some archaic idioms, like (\\"be ablaze\\"). Hen is a gender-neutral personal pronoun in Swedish intended to replace the gender- specific (\\"she\\") and (\\"he\\") to some extent: it can be used when the gender of a person is not known, when the person does not identify with a binary gender or when it is not desirable to specify them as either a \\"she\\" or \\"he\\". The word was first proposed in 1966 and used occasionally in print, and again in 1994, with reference to the Finnish , a personal pronoun that is gender- neutral, since Finnish does not have grammatical genders. However, it did not receive really widespread recognition until around 2010, when it began to be used in some books, magazines and newspapers, and provoked some media debates and controversy over feminism, gender neutrality and parenting. Since 2015 is included in , the official glossary of the Swedish Academy. is currently treated as a neologism by Swedish manuals of style. Major newspapers like have recommended against its usage, though some journalists still use it. The Swedish Language Council has not issued any specific proscriptions against the use of , but recommends the inflected forms (\\"her(s)/his\\") as the possessive form and the object form (\\"her/him\\") over , which also occurs. has two basic usages: as a way avoid a stated preference to either gender; or as a way of referring to individuals who identify as neither male nor female or who reject the division of male/female gender roles on ideological grounds. A subtler strategy of gender-neutralizing pronouns is the replacement of (which means either \\"man\\" or \\"one\\", as in: One ought to gender-neutralize pronouns) with (which, literally translated, means \\"one\\"). The problem with this is that is already used in some dialects and contexts as a replacement for , and some native speakers of Swedish would thus consider the word as belonging to regional or low-prestige language. Nouns for occupations in Swedish used to have feminine forms, to show either (1) a female professional, (\\"teacher, nurse\\") or (2) the wife of a male professional/dignitary, (\\"colonel's wife, professor's wife\\"). The use of titles was abolished mainly in the 1960s through , introducing the use of 2nd person singular for all normal daily address of one person. Since then, women have entered traditionally male professions like military service, and men have increasingly entered lines of work which had been coded as feminine. Thus most professional nouns in today's Swedish are void of real gender markers, yet often in the masculine form, and any special title for a dignitary's wife is seldom used. Female endings are common, however, in professions like / (\\"actress\\"), (\\"singer\\"), (\\"dancer\\"), (\\"waitress\\"), (\\"women's hair dresser\\"), while sound very male. Many of these nouns have French origins and are long established in both female and male use, but for example (\\"driver\\") exists only in the male form for both sexes, and the same with (\\"managing director\\"), while in modern Swedish is used with other meanings (in fashion and mathematics). The use of many female endings may seem archaic and connected with an inferior status, like (\\"female teacher\\" for \\"children\\") compared to (\\"teacher\\"). Nowadays the female words (\\"nurse/sister\\"), (\\"miss\\" in addressing a school teacher) can be used even for male professionals. For professions/titles ending with there are no clear rules; they can be modified to or , like (\\"female professional\\"), (\\"spokesperson\\"), or retained as (\\"Ms Chairman\\" of the Parliament), (\\"district court judge\\"), . \\"Policewoman\\" may be found as , or if gender is important, otherwise a completely gender neutral form like is commonly used, and the only established form in the case of (\\"fireman\\"). The titles of high nobility, like (\\"duchess\\"), (\\"countess\\") may still represent wife of or female bearer of the noble title. (like \\"Fr√§ulein\\") has fallen out of use for unmarried women, but it remains as a title to address a teacher in school and in special contexts, like (\\"Miss Sweden\\"). ===Icelandic=== The policy of gender neutrality in the Icelandic language is that the speaker uses the normal grammatical gender of the word of a public office or another office, no matter the gender of the holder. For example, the masculine words president and minister, and were used when Vigd√≠s Finnbogad√≥ttir was the president of Iceland. == Romance languages  Historical note === Ancient Greek and Classical Latin had generic words for \\"human\\"/\\"humanity in general\\" or \\"human being\\"‚Äî () (grammatically masculine or feminine) and (grammatically masculine) respectively‚Äîwhich are the etyma of such modern terms as \\"anthropology\\" or . For \\"male human as opposed to female human\\", there existed the separate words () and (the etyma of English \\"androgen\\" and \\"virile\\", respectively). Most modern derivatives of the Latin noun , however, such as French , Italian , Portuguese , and Spanish , have acquired a predominantly male denotation, although they are sometimes still used generically, notably in high registers. For example, French for an anthropology museum exhibiting human culture, not specifically \\"male culture\\". This semantic shift was parallel to the evolution of the word \\"man\\" in English. These languages therefore largely lack a third, neutral option aside from the gender-specific words for \\"man\\" and \\"woman\\". Both Spanish and Portuguese are used to say \\"human being\\". In Romanian, however, the cognate retains its original meaning of \\"any human person\\", as opposed to the gender- specific words for \\"man\\" and \\"woman\\" ( and , respectively). In Romansh the word only refers to a male, whereas \\"human being\\" is expressed in different ways in the different dialects: or . === French === The use of non-gendered job titles in French is common and generally standard practice among the francophones in Belgium and in Canada. By law in Quebec, the use of gender- inclusive job titles is obligatory if the writer has not opted for gender-free terms. In France, however, the practice of using exclusively masculine job titles is still widespread in educated use and has been upheld by the Acad√©mie Fran√ßaise. The most common way of feminizing job titles in French is by adding a feminine suffix to the masculine version of the noun, most commonly (, ), (, ), (, ), (, ), (, ). For job titles ending in epicene suffixes such as () or (), the only change is in the article () and any associated adjectives. Abbreviated professions only change the article as well (). In some cases, words already had a feminine form which was rarely used, and a new one was created. For instance had the feminine but was still created. had the feminine (typically used only of the goddess Artemis) but was still created. Nowadays both feminine forms can be encountered, with the old ones being generally more prevalent in Europe and the new ones in Qu√©bec. To make words or phrases gender-inclusive, French-speakers use two methods: #hyphens, brackets or capital letters to insert feminine endings: , , or (the brackets method is now often considered sexist, because brackets are used to show something less important) ; most writers avoid this practice in official titles such as Governor General and favor the next process; #hendiadys containing a feminine word and a masculine word: , . Words that formerly referred solely to a dignitary's wife () are now used to refer to a woman holding the same dignitary position. Although marriage titles have mainly dropped out of use, many cite the possible confusion as a reason for continuing to use those such as or . For this reason, the traditional use remains the most frequent in France. Nonetheless, in France, the husband of a female ambassador would never be known as . Instead, he would be called literally \\"the ambassador's husband\\", . The title has been rejected in public writing by the French government in December 2012, in favour of for all adult women, without respect to civil status. Although some long-established positions of high prestige, such Governor General of Canada exist in both masculine and feminine variants, honorary titles remain masculine throughout the Francophonie even when the award or honor is bestowed unto a woman. Examples are titles such as , , , , , used in the Order of Canada, the National Order of Quebec, France's Legion of Honor and the Acad√©mie Fran√ßaise, or Belgium's and Monaco's Order of the Crown.See also the French version of this article. In 1984, the French government made a move toward feminization by creating a terminology commission. However, many political groups condemn this movement. The Acad√©mie Fran√ßaise does not support the grand feminization of job titles. The Academy believes that this process will simply complicate the balance in the use of gender designation that has developed over the years. In this statement on their website, the Acad√©mie Fran√ßaise argues that gender designation does not play a major role in the complex network of jobs, and that the choice of the masculine gender as the neutral gender simply exists as a way to neutralize differences between the sexes: > One of the constraints of the French language is that it only has two > genders; to describe qualities common to both sexes, it was necessary to > impart a generic value to only one of the two genders so it can neutralize > the difference between the sexes. The Latin heritage opted for the > masculine. Professors Georges Dum√©zil and Claude L√©vi-Strauss, to whom the > Academy had entrusted the drafting of this text, which was adopted > unanimously in the session of 14 June 1984, concluded thus: \\"[...] Changes, > made deliberately in one area, may in others have unexpected consequences. > They risk putting confusion and disorder in a subtle balance acquired > through use, and that it would seem better advised to leave the usage alone > without change.\\" In this same statement, the Acad√©mie Fran√ßaise expressed that if an individual wishes that her job title reflects her gender, it is her right to name her own identity in personal correspondences. === Italian === In Italian, female job titles are easily formed with , and other feminine suffixes: a female teacher is a , a female doctor is a . However, for jobs that have only recently opened up to women, there is some resistance to using the feminine forms, which are considered ugly or ridiculous. For example, a female lawyer can be called or (feminine) but some might prefer to use the word (masculine). Opponents of these feminine forms claim that they're offensive because they overemphasize the gender, or that they're incorrect neologisms. The Accademia della Crusca and the Treccani have spoken in favour of the usage of feminine job titles. Italian job announcements sometimes have a specific expected gender (, ) but it has become more common to address two genders with a slash (). Many adjectives have identical feminine and masculine forms, so they are effectively gender-neutral when used without articles as job titles (, ) and in many other contexts; slashes are often applied to articles (, the customer). There are full sets of masculine and feminine pronouns and articles (with some coincidences) and some traces of neuter; adjectives are declined, even if many remain the same, and adjective declension is also used in the many verbal tenses involving the past participle. The masculine gender is the default, and most correct form, for isolated adjectives and pronouns, for mixed-gender groups and for generic usage. === Spanish and Portuguese === In Spanish, the feminine is usually marked with the suffix , and it is generally easy to make a feminine noun from a masculine one by changing the ending to : (surgeon; m./f.); , (notary; m./f.); (teacher; m./f.) If the masculine version ends with a consonant, the feminine is typically formed by adding an to it as well: , . With certain endings there can be alternatives with the suffix and without it, (\\"female apostle\\"), (\\"female city counselor\\"), (\\"female trainee\\"), while most with such endings do not allow it, like (\\"spokesperson, boss, consul\\"). Note that not all nouns ending in are masculine (, the hand), and not all nouns ending in are feminine (, the day): * Singular nouns ending in or are invariable in some cases, and thus use always the same article: (witness; either male or female; now can be used with both articles). (the person), (the people), (the population) and (the victim). * Nouns with the epicene ending , such as (dentist, cyclist, tourist, specialist; either male or female) are almost always invariable. One exception is (male fashion designer), which was created as a counterpart to (fashion designer, or clothes maker). * Some words ending in have a female counterpart: (\\"prophet\\"), (\\"poet\\"). Others use same for in both masculine and feminine: (\\"athlete\\"), (\\"therapist\\"). * Some nouns ending in refer only to men: , that is (catholic) \\"priest\\", a word which ends in but is grammatically masculine, for a profession traditionally held only by men; means \\"cure\\". For \\"priestess\\", the female of is used, . carries both the meanings \\"female pastor\\" and \\"pastor's wife\\". Invariable words in Spanish are often derived from the Latin agent participles and (accusative case): , ending in . But a female is a , and a female is a . is a female parallel form of (\\"shop assistant\\"), likewise of . A few problematic cases remain: * used to be \\"the president's wife\\", but there have been several women presidents in Latin American republics, and in modern usage the word means mainly a female president, with the meaning of \\"the president's wife\\" being replaced by the phrase (\\"first lady\\"). Some feel that can be treated as invariable, given that it ends in , but others prefer to use a different feminine form. * (\\"the policeman\\"). Since means \\"the police force\\", the only useful feminine counterpart is (\\"the police woman\\"). * (judge). Many new judges in Spain are women. Since the ending of is uncommon in Spanish, some prefer being called while others have created the neologism . Common nouns ending in are usually feminine, as in the cases of and . Activists against perceived sexism in language are also concerned about words where the feminine form has a different (usually less prestigious) meaning: * An ambiguous case is \\"secretary\\": a is an attendant for her boss or a typist, usually female, while a is a high-rank position (as in ), usually held by males. With the access of women to positions labelled as \\"secretary general\\" or similar, some have chosen to use the masculine gendered and others have to clarify that is a decision position, not a subordinate one. * An offensive example is (\\"public man\\", a politician) and (\\"public woman\\", a prostitute). As in other Romance languages, it is traditional to use the masculine form of nouns and pronouns when referring to males and females collectively. Advocates of gender-neutral language modification consider this to be sexist and favor new ways of writing and speaking. Two methods have begun to come into use. One of them, seen most often in Spain, Mexico and Argentina, is to use the at-sign (@), the anarchist circled A (‚í∂) or the letter x to replace or , especially in radical political writing ( or ), but use of the slash (/) as in () is more common. The ligature √¶ can be used in the same way ( for writers of two genders, although is more common). Opponents of such language modification feel that they are degrading to the language. Many also raise the question of how these new words are to be pronounced. See also Alternative political spellings. There have also been attempts to reword sentences in such way that gendered words referring to people are not used, such as using (law firm) instead of ([male] lawyer). Some politicians have begun to avoid perceived sexism in their speeches; the Mexican president Vicente Fox Quesada, for example, was famous for repeating gendered nouns in their masculine and feminine versions (). This way of speaking is subject to parodies where new words with the opposite ending are created for the sole purpose of contrasting with the gendered word traditionally used for the common case (like * and * in or ). Being very similar to Spanish, all considerations and almost all the examples above apply also to Portuguese. Minority languages of this group can use expressions with at-sign ( in Galician), ligature √¶ ( in Mirandese language and in Aragonese language). == Slavic languages  Serbo-Croatian === Like most other Slavic languages, Serbo-Croatian has more obstacles to gender-neutral language modification than English. The Serbo-Croatian language has different forms for masculine and feminine past tense: / (he was working), / (she was working). Only the rare aorist (in Serbo-Croatian the aorist is a tense, not an aspect) makes no distinction between genders. Also, all nouns in Serbo-Croatian have grammatical gender: masculine, feminine or neuter. Almost all nouns which end with a consonant are masculine, almost all which end with / are feminine and almost all that end with / or / are neuter. Adjectives and verb aspects inflect for gender as well, but not in all tenses. Gender-neutral language advocates are also unhappy with Serbo-Croatian's use of noun gender. Some masculine nouns signify an occupation, while the corresponding feminine nouns refer to objects: the masculine noun / means \\"male speaker\\", while the feminine noun / means \\"female speaker\\", but also \\"podium\\", or a \\"speaker's platform\\"; masculine / means \\"male coach\\", while the feminine word / means \\"female coach\\", but also \\"warm-up suit\\". An exception to the masculine form- occupation and feminine form-an object dichotomy are words for a skillful person: / which means \\"an expert\\", while the feminine word / which means \\"a witch\\". Many feminists argue that in the Serbo-Croatian language it is natural to differentiate the gender of job titles, as opposed to just using the masculine grammatical gender. Advocates of gender-neutral language find it difficult to avoid specifying gender in Serbo-Croatian, since it is so built into the language. But one area where they have a bit more flexibility is the word \\"person\\", in its various forms: a person can be referred to as / (\\"human\\"; masculine gender), / (\\"person\\"; feminine gender) or / (\\"human being\\"; neuter gender). Plural forms don't have a clear general meaning: / means only \\"male professors\\" and \\" / means only \\"female professors\\". Many feminists prefer to say / (male professors and female professors) and to write / . === Russian === Russian intrinsically shares many of the same non-gender- neutral characteristics with other European languages. Certain words are understood to refer to either men or women regardless of their grammatical gender, such as (, \\"human\\"; grammatically masculine), as opposed to (, \\"man\\"; masculine with respect to agreement, but morphologically feminine) and (, \\"woman\\"; feminine), and are in fact traditionally used in cases where gender- specific terms would be used in English. Several terms that roughly mean \\"person\\" are grammatically neuter or feminine, and can similarly be used to refer to either men or women: (, neuter, lit. \\"face\\"), (, feminine), (, feminine). All such terms have bureaucratic and other (not necessarily negative) connotations and are seldom used colloquially. Note also that as a general rule Russian does not use neuter terms for people, just as English does not use \\"it\\" as gender-neutral pronoun. Job titles have a masculine and a feminine version in Russian, though in most cases the feminine version is only used in colloquial speech. The masculine form is typically treated as \\"unmarked\\", i.e. it does not necessarily imply that the person is male, while the feminine form is \\"marked\\" and can only be used when referring to a woman. In some cases, the feminine title is used, on occasion, as derogatory or with connotation of a suboptimal performance. In other cases, it is only used as slang, e.g. (, female doctor), or sometimes (female director). Sometimes, this is not the case: (, actress), (, poetess; e.g. Anna Akhmatova insisted on being called (, masculine) instead). Even in cases where the feminine term is not seen as derogatory, however, there is a growing tendency to use masculine terms in more formal contexts that stress the individual's membership in a profession: (, \\"At age 15 she became a piano teacher/m\\", formal register). The feminine form may be used in less formal context to stress a personal description of the individual: (, \\"Nastia became a teacher/f\\", informal register). Military ranks and formal offices may also have a feminine term (e.g. , ), which usually means that the referred person is the wife of the appropriate office holder. However, this use is somewhat archaic. For this reason, use of the masculine occupation terms when referring to women, is in fact seen as more politically correct and constitutes a growing trend. The actual gender of the person can still be indicated through the verb: for example, in the phrase (, \\"the doctor/m advised/f\\"), the gender of the verb shows that the doctor was female, even as the masculine (more respectful) occupation term is used. Note, however, that there are also some grammatically feminine terms with positive connotations that are routinely used for both men and women, for example, (, \\"celebrity\\", feminine because it is an abstract noun). Russian adjectives are inflected for grammatical gender and so are verbs in the past tense. When a masculine term is used to refer to a woman, the verb usually remains in the feminine, while adjectives and possessive pronouns may take either masculine or feminine form: (, \\"our/m new/m doctor/m recommended/f\\") or (, \\"our/f new/f doctor/m recommended/f\\"). The former usage is more formal, while the latter is more colloquial. The third-person pronoun typically reflects the actual gender of the person when this is known, (, \\"the doctor/m said/f that ...\\"), but typically agrees with the grammatical gender of its antecedent when an abstract person is discussed: (, \\"Every/m doctor/m must/m remember that ...\\"). == Celtic languages == Nouns in the six modern Celtic languages belong to either one of two groups, masculine or feminine. There are only two singular third person personal prounouns which correspond to the grammatical gender of the noun to which they refer; for example, the Scottish Gaelic for \\"It is big\\" is when referring to , \\"a book\\" (masculine), but when talking about , \\"a drink\\" (feminine). A very small number of nouns in some languages can be either masculine or feminine. When referring to these mixed-gender nouns, a decision has to be made, based on factors such as meaning, dialect or sometimes even personal preference, whether to use a masculine or feminine pronoun. There are no neutral or mixed-gender singular third person pronouns. The result of how having two grammatical genders manifests itself in each individual language is detailed below. === Welsh === In Welsh, the third person singular personal pronouns are \\"he, it\\" and \\"she, it\\". , \\"she\\", is the traditional dummy pronoun; it is used when talking about the weather, , \\"It is windy\\", or time, , \\"It is ten o'clock\\". The singular possessive pronoun is the same word for both masculine and feminine referents, but the gender difference is seen in the sound changes it effects on the following word. When masculine, the subsequent word will take a soft mutation, but when feminine, causes an aspirate mutation or prefixes an to a vowel and the semivowel [j]. An example of this is the word \\"cat\\" becoming either \\"his cat\\" or \\"her cat\\". Grammatical gender is sometimes shown in other parts of speech by means of mutations, vowel changes and specific word choices. Examples of this include: * \\"the biggest\\" (masculine) without mutation vs \\"the biggest\\" (feminine) with soft mutation * \\"Sam was seen\\" (masculine) with soft mutation of vs \\"Sam was seen\\" (feminine) with no mutation * \\"a redhead\\" (masculine) vs \\"a redhead\\" (feminine) * \\"a white one\\" (masculine) vs \\"a white one\\" (feminine) with mutation and vowel change * \\"four lovers/boyfriends\\" with masculine vs \\"four lovers/girlfriends\\" with feminine A few job titles have gendered terms, for example \\"businessman\\" and \\"businesswoman\\". In other instances a feminine job title may derive from a masculine one such as feminine \\"carer, caretaker\\" from masculine , or \\"secretary\\" from . Occasionally only one meaning of a masculine word can be made feminine, for example, when \\"secretary\\" refers to a personal assistant, there are masculine and feminine forms, and respectively, however when \\"secretary\\" is used as a title for people in leadership, the only valid form is . This means, in her job as Cabinet Secretary for Education, Kirsty Williams is always despite being a woman. The same is true of and , which are the masculine and feminine words for \\"teacher\\", but when used to mean \\"professor\\", only can be used. Theoretically any job title can be made feminine but in practice most job titles without a feminine suffix are used as a gender-neutral term. Some authorities emphasize that a distinction needs to be made between biological sex and grammatical gender. The Welsh Academy English‚ÄìWelsh Dictionary explains \\"it must be reiterated, gender is a classification, not an indicator of sex; it is misleading and unfortunate that the labels have to be used, according to tradition. (...) There is no reason why nouns ending in -wr, -ydd should not refer equally well to a woman as to a man.\\" This is why the Welsh Government's Translation Service recommends translating such phrases as \\"If a parent sends his or her child to school\\" is translated as , literally \\"If a parent sends his child to school\\" as \\"parent\\" is a masculine noun. Some consider the agent suffix to be more gender neutral than however the Translation Service advises against the use of words ending in in job titles unless it is natural to do so. This means that established words such as \\"translator\\" are readily used whereas terms such as for \\"manager\\" instead of or \\"(specifically feminine) director\\" instead of are proscribed by the Service. It does however allow for their use in personal contexts such as email signatures and business cards. A distinction in gender is also found in some other classes of words, for instance, those referring to nationality. This becomes is more apparent in Welsh, which prefers to use a noun, than in English, which tends to use an adjective of nationality, for example, \\"He is Irish\\" is more often \\"He is an Irishman\\" and \\"She is Irish\\" becomes \\"She is an Irishwoman\\". With countries that do not have such a close connection with Wales, usually those further away, only one form of the noun is found, for example, \\"a Russian\\" (both masculine and feminine). Phrases can also be used rather than a single word and these can be gender specific, e.g., \\"a man from Angola, an Angolan\\" and \\"a woman from Angola, an Angolan\\", or have one form for both referents, e.g., \\"one from Angola, an Angolan\\". In the plural, there is a single third person plural pronoun, \\"they\\", and no distinction is made for grammatical gender. With nouns, the tendency is to use the form of the grammatically masculine nouns when referring to groups of mixed sex, so \\"teachers\\" (from masculine ) is used when describing male and female teachers together. The plural \\"teachers\\" (from feminine ) exists is used rarely and in contexts where the speaker desires to emphasize the fact that the teachers are female. === Cornish === The Cornish third person singular pronouns are \\"he, it\\" and \\"she, it\\". Job titles usually have both a masculine and feminine version, the latter usually derived from the former by means of the suffix , for example, \\"businessman\\" and \\"businesswoman\\", \\"(male) secretary\\" and \\"(female) secretary\\", \\"(male) officer\\" and \\"(female) officer\\". In the last example, compare Welsh which uses the grammatically masculine term for both males and females. Occasionally, nouns of have only one gender despite referring to either males or females, for example \\"messenger\\" is always feminine. ==See also== *Binnen-I, a convention for gender-neutral language in German *Gender-neutral language in English *Gender neutrality in genderless languages *Gender-specific and gender-neutral third-person pronouns *Gender role *Grammatical gender *IGALA (International Gender and Language Group) *Markedness *Gender-neutral language *Gender-neutral pronoun **Hen (pronoun) **Pronoun game *Feminist language planning *Lavender linguistics ==References== == External links == * A detailed clarification in Esperanto about the gender-specificity of Esperanto nouns * Justin B.

In 2016, Dr Benjamin Rawson, Country Director of Fauna & Flora International - Vietnam Programme, announced a discovery of an additional population including more than 500 individuals found in Central Vietnam, bringing the total population up to approximately 1000 individuals. ==Taxonomy== P. cinerea was originally described as a subspecies of P. nemaeus in 1997,Nadler, T. 1997. \\"A new subspecies of Douc langur, Pygathrix nemaeus cinereus ssp. nov.\\" Zoologische Garten 4: 165-176. but later elevated to species status due to morphological differences. Other research has shown significant genetic differences as well.Roos, C. and Nadler, T. 2001. \\"Molecular evolution of the douc langurs\\". Zoologische Garten 71(1): 1-6. This species does sometimes hybridize with P. nemaeus.Long, H. 2007. \\"Distribution, population and conservation status of the grey-shanked\\". Vietnamese Journal of Primatology, 1: 55-60. ==Physical description== Grey-shanked doucs are very similar in appearance to P. nemaeus. They are light grey with a pale underside. Their feet and hand are black and their shins are a dark grey. The face is brownish orange on top with a white chin. Hair around the chin is white. The throat is white and lined on the bottom with an orange, brown collar. Males are slightly larger than females averaging 10.9 kg. Females average about 8.2 kg.Covert, H., T. Nadler, N. Stevens, K. Wright. 2008. \\"Comparisons of Suspensory Behaviors Among Pygathrix cinerea, P. nemaeus, and Nomascus leucogenys in Cuc Phuong National Park, Vietnam\\". International Journal of Primatology, 29: 1467-1480. ==Behavior== Grey-shanked doucs are diurnal and primarily arboreal. They move about through trees by jumping and brachiating. In the past they have been found in groups as large as fifty individuals but those numbers have been greatly reduced to 4 to 15 individuals. Males are the dominant gender and dominance hierarchies have been observed while in captivity. The grey-shanked douc langur communicates using touch, visual communication, and sound. Growls are used to show aggression. They can be used as a threat or warning toward other individuals. A soft, twitter sound is used when being submissive.Primate Info Net, 2009. \\"Douc Langur (Pygathrix cinerea)\\" (On-line). Wisconsin Primate Research Center. Accessed December 10, 2009 at http://pin.primate.wisc.edu/factsheets/links/pygathrix. Grey-shanked doucs also engage in grooming to remove parasites and to establish and strengthen bonds between group members. This is usually done before resting for the night. Group members will also spar with each other. Sparring is a type of aggressive behavior in which participants will slap, pull, and grab each other. Visual communication includes facial expressions and various postures. Facial expressions include grimacing, which is used to show submissiveness, play face, which is used to play with another group member, and staring which suggests either curiosity or aggression. Facial expressions are also used during courtship. The male will make faces at the female indicating that he is ready to copulate. Grey-shanked langurs are primarily folivourous but will also eat other plant parts such as seeds, fruits, and flowers. They prefer young leaves and fruit that has not yet fully ripened.2008\\\\. \\"Southeast Asian Mammal Databank\\" General Info. Species Index. Accessed Dec 10, 2009. ===Reproduction=== The breeding season usually occurs between August and December and gestation is about 165 to 190 days. When courting, potential mates will use facial expressions to indicate that they are ready to copulate. One will thrust its jaw forward, shake its head, and raise and lower its eyebrows. The other will then respond with the same action. This may be repeated several times. The female then presents herself to the male.Ademmer, C., K. Klumpe, I. Maravic, C. K√∂nigshofen, C. Schwitzer. 2002. Nahrungsaufnahme und Hormonstatus von Kleideraffen (Pygathrix n. nemaeus Linnaeus, 1771). im Zoo. Z. K√∂lner Zoo, 45: 129-135. Births usually occur between January and August, during the fruiting season. The mother will give birth to one offspring weighing 500 g to 720 g. Females are sexually mature at about four years of age. ==Conservation== The grey-shanked douc langur is listed on the IUCN Red List as critically endangered.Ngoc Thanh, V., Lippold, L., Nadler, T. & Timmins, R.J. 2008. Pygathrix cinerea. In: IUCN 2009. IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Version 2009.2. <www.iucnredlist.org>. Downloaded on 15 December 2009. It is one of \\"The World's 25 Most Endangered Primates.\\" Hunting has been a major problem for grey-shanked doucs. They are hunted for bush meat and for traditional medicine purposes. Their bones are used to make a substance called \\"monkey bone balm\\" which is thought to improve hemoglobin regeneration and renal function. Monkey bone balm is also believed to treat lack of appetite, insomnia, and anemia. Grey-shanked doucs are also used in the exotic wild life trade. The adults are killed and the infants are taken and sold as pets. The Vietnam War also played a big part in reducing the population. Soldiers would use the monkeys for target practice. Deforestation and habitat fragmentation are also major threats. Laws are in place to prevent the destruction of their habitat and to prevent hunting, but although these laws have not been strongly enforced, that may be changing. Researchers have concluded that due to the major deforestation and climate change of these provinces of Vietnam, that the population of the Grey-shanked duoc will sharply decline in the next coming years (Vu et al., 2020). Their species will be pushed into a high mountainous area with little to no resources for survival (Tran et al., 2018) Studies are under way to learn more about the distribution, range, and behavior of grey-shanked doucs. These studies will help experts to find more ways to conserve this species. A long term study in the Gia Lai Provence is currently being conducted as a part of the Frankfurt Zoological Society's Vietnam Primate Conservation Program. The Frankfurt Zoological Society also works with the Endangered Primate Rescue Center which has an ongoing Captive Breeding program. On July 3, 2007, it was reported that the WWF and Conservation International had monitored at least 116 of the primates in central Vietnam, increasing its chances of survival. In the Central Highlands, Gray-shanked douc Langurs were tortured and murdered by Vietnamese troops who posted pictures of it online. On March 3, 2016, Fauna & Flora International announced that a new population of over 500 grey-shanked doucs had been discovered in Central Vietnam. ==References== grey-shanked douc Category:Mammals of Vietnam grey-shanked douc Category:Species endangered by human consumption for medicinal or magical purposes Category:Species endangered by use as food Category:Species endangered by the pet trade Category:Species endangered by deforestation Category:Species endangered by habitat fragmentation ","title":"Gray-shanked douc"},{"id":"9116382","text":"A genderless language is a natural or constructed language that has no distinctions of grammatical gender‚Äîthat is, no categories requiring morphological agreement between nouns and associated pronouns, adjectives, articles, or verbs.Yasir Suleiman (ed.) (1999) \\"Language and Society in the Middle East and North Africa\\", , Chapter 10: \\"Gender in a genderless language: The case of Turkish\\", by Friederike Braun The notion of a genderless language is distinct from that of gender neutrality or gender-neutral language, which is wording that does not presuppose a particular natural gender. A discourse in a grammatically genderless language is not necessarily gender-neutral, although genderless languages exclude many possibilities for reinforcement of gender-related stereotypes, such as using masculine pronouns when referring to persons by their occupations (although some languages that may be identified as genderless, including English, do have distinct male and female pronouns). A lack of gendered pronouns is also distinct from a lack of gender in the grammatical sense. Genderless languages do have various means to recognize gender, such as gender-specific words (mother, son, etc., and distinct pronouns such as he and she in some cases), as well as gender-specific context, both biological and cultural. Genderless languages are listed at List of languages by type of grammatical genders. Genderless languages include the Indo-European languages Armenian, Persian and Central Kurdish (Sorani Dialect), all the modern Turkic languages (such as Turkish), Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and most Austronesian languages (such as the Polynesian languages). == Austronesian languages  Tagalog === Tagalog, like most Austronesian languages, is gender-neutral. However, because Tagalog has had over three centuries of Spanish influence, gender is usually differentiated in certain Spanish loanwords by way of the suffixes -a (feminine) and -o (masculine). These words mostly refer to ethnicities, occupations, and family. Some examples are: Pilipina/Pilipino (Filipina/o) and their derivative nicknames Pinay/Pinoy, tindera/tindero (vendor), inhinyera/inhinyero (engineer), tita/tito (aunt/uncle), manang/manong (elder sister/brother), and lola/lolo (grandmother/grandfather). A few gender-differentiating pairs originate from Chinese, mostly relating to kinship terminology such as ate (big sister) and kuya (big brother). == Indo-European languages  Armenian === In Armenian, neither pronouns nor nouns have grammatical gender. The third person pronoun ’∂’°(na) means both he and she. And ’∂÷Ä’°’∂÷Ñ (nranq) is for they. ===English=== English lacks grammatical gender, but can be considered to have a pronominal gender system with semantic gender represented in the pronouns. This system of gender is quite minimal compared to languages with grammatical gender. Historically, \\"he\\" referred to a generic person whose gender is unspecified in formal language, but the gender-neutral singular they has long been common in informal language, and is becoming increasingly so in formal language. The use of the neuter pronoun 'it' in reference to a person is considered dehumanizing. === Kurdish === While Kurdish has two grammatical genders, none of the Kurdish languages have gender pronouns; thus the third person singular pronoun ew refers to \\"he\\", \\"she\\" and \\"it\\". === Persian === Persian is commonly considered a genderless language, but can be considered to have a pronominal gender system with common and neuter genders represented in the pronouns. For both males and females, the same nouns, pronouns, and adjectives are used. For example, * u () is used for both \\"he\\" and \\"she\\" (common gender); * ishƒÅn () is used for both \\"he\\" and \\"she\\" but in formal contexts and writing; * ƒÅn () is used for \\"it\\" (neuter gender). == Other natural languages  Turkish === Turkish is a gender-neutral language, like most other Turkic languages. Nouns have a generic form and this generic form is used for both males and females. For example, doktor (doctor), eczacƒ± (pharmacist), m√ºhendis (engineer) etc. Very few words for person reference contain a clue to the gender of the referred person, such as anne/baba \\"mother/father\\", kƒ±z/oƒülan \\"girl/boy\\", hanƒ±m/bey \\"lady/sir\\" At the same time research has shown a significant presence of semantically-implied gender (covert gender) in Turkish. In addition to the absence of semantic gender neutrality it was also noted that the usage of gender markings in Turkish is asymmetrical. In translations of sentences from English texts where the gender is evident (e.g., usage of he/she or male vs. female context) it was noticed that feminine gender was marked in 50% of cases, while masculine was marked only in 5% of cases. While translations are not typically representative of linguistic data, similar asymmetry was also observed in Turkish literary and newspaper texts.Friederike Braun, \\"Turkish. The communication of gender in Turkish\\", in \\"Gender Across Languages: The linguistic representation of women and men\\", Volume 1 (2001), (US, hardbound), (Europe, hardbound), (US paperback), (Europe, paperback) John Benjamins === Yoruba === Yoruba is a Volta‚ÄìNiger language spoken in Nigeria, referred to by its native speakers as Ede Yoruba. Yoruba is a gender neutral language. Gendered pronouns such as he or she do not exist in Yoruba language. Words like brother, sister, son and daughter also do not exist. Instead, the most important organizing category is age. Therefore, people are classified by whether they are √©gb«´n (older sibling) or aburo (younger sibling). In order to say brother, one would need to say \\"aburo mi okunrin\\" (this roughly translates to \\"my younger sibling, the male\\"). Male and female are also quite unlike man and woman in the English language. \\"Obinrin\\" and \\"okunrin\\" which mean \\"one who has a vagina\\" and \\"one who has a penis\\" are used to mean female and male respectively. Due to European colonization, western pronouns are becoming more widespread. === Swahili === Swahili is a Bantu language spoken in many parts of Africa such as Kenya and Tanzania. It is largely gender neutral in specific nouns. Words such as actor/actress (mwigaji wa hadithi) and waiter/waitress (mtumishi mezani) are gender neutral among most others in the language. The words he, him, she, her translate to a single word in Swahili, yeye. There are gender specific words for man/woman (mwanadamu/wanawake) and mother/father (mama/baba), so it is not completely gender neutral, although a vast majority of the words do not distinguish between male or female. The language does not have a grammatical gender either. === Chinese === The Chinese language or languages/topolects are largely gender-neutral, and possess few linguistic gender markers. Comprehension of written and spoken Chinese is almost wholly dependent on word order, as it has no inflections for gender, tense, or case. There are also very few derivational inflections; instead, the language relies heavily on compounding to create new words. A Chinese word is thus inherently gender- neutral, but any given word can be preceded by an adjective/root indicating masculinity or femininity. For example, the word for \\"doctor\\" is yƒ´shƒìng (ÈÜ´Áîü or ÂåªÁîü) and can only be made gender-specific by adding the root for \\"male\\" or \\"female\\" to the front of it; thus to specify a male doctor, one would need to prefix n√°n Áî∑ (male), as in n√°nyƒ´shƒìng (Áî∑ÈÜ´Áîü or Áî∑ÂåªÁîü). Under normal circumstances, both male and female doctors would simply be referred to as yƒ´shƒìng (ÈÜ´Áîü or ÂåªÁîüÔºâ. Spoken Mandarin Chinese also has only one third-person pronoun, tƒÅ for all referents (though -men ÂÄë / ‰ª¨ can be added as a plural suffix). TƒÅ can mean \\"he\\", \\"she\\", or \\"it\\". However, the different meanings of tƒÅ are written with different characters: \\"‰ªñ\\", containing the human radical \\"‰∫ª\\", from \\"‰∫∫\\", meaning person, for he or a person of undetermined gender; \\"Â•π\\", containing the feminine radical \\"Â•≥\\", for \\"she\\"; and \\"ÂÆÉ\\" for \\"it\\"; \\"Á•Ç\\" containing the spirit radical \\"Á§ª\\", from \\"Á§∫\\", for deities; \\"Áâ†\\" containing the cow radical \\"Áâú\\", from \\"Áâõ\\", for animals. The character for \\"she\\", containing the \\"woman\\" radical (glyphic element of a character's composition), was invented in the early twentieth century due to western influence; prior to this, the character indicating \\"he\\" today was used for both genders ‚Äî it contains the \\"person\\" radical, which, as noted above, is not gender-specific.  Cantonese  In written Cantonese, the third-person singular pronoun is keui5, written as ‰Ω¢; it may refer to people of either gender because Chinese does not have gender roles as English in third-person pronouns. The practice of replacing the \\"‰∫ª\\" radical with \\"Â•≥\\" (forming the character Âßñ) to specifically indicate the female gender may also be seen occasionally in informal writing; however, this is neither widely accepted nor grammatically or semantically required, and the character Âßñ has a separate meaning in standard Chinese. The entry for \\"‰Ω¢\\" (humanum.arts.cuhk.edu.hk) notes its use as a third-person pronoun in Cantonese, but the entry for \\"Âßñ\\" () does not; it only gives the pronunciation geoi6 and notes that it is used in placenames. == See also == *Gender marking in job titles *Gender neutrality in languages with grammatical gender *IGALA (International Gender and Language Group) == References == == External links == * On the Creation of \\"She\\" Category:Gender- neutral language ","title":"Gender neutrality in genderless languages"},{"id":"9116392","text":"John Taylor (15 February 1914 ‚Äì 22 February 1978) was an English footballer who became a manager. ==Career== Taylor was a full-back who started his playing career with Wolverhampton Wanderers in 1931. He made his senior debut on 1 February 1936 in a 0‚Äì5 loss at Brentford. He became a first team regular after Cecil Shaw left in November 1936 and was a virtual ever-present for the next season-and-a-half. His only full season in the team saw the club missed out on the league title by a single point. He was transferred to Norwich City in Summer 1938, and replaced in the Wolves side by his younger brother Frank. He managed one full season at Carrow Road before the suspension of league football due to World War II. After guesting for Barnsley and Watford during the war, he joined Hull City in July 1947. Hull were at the time were managed by former Sunderland and England inside-forward, Raich Carter, when Taylor was part of the side that won the Third Division North championship in 1948-49. In May 1950, he dropped into the non-league to become player-manager of Weymouth. He returned to the Football League in June 1952, when he replaced Dave Mangnall at Queens Park Rangers who had been recently relegated from the Second Division. Under Taylor they never managed to finish higher in the league than 10th. In addition to this they suffered two humiliating FA Cup defeats to non-league opposition, including a 6-1 thrashing by Hereford United in the 2nd round in December 1957. He was asked to manage the Third Division South representative team in October 1957. Taylor left QPR in May 1959 to take over at Leeds United but within a year Leeds were relegated to the Second Division and he resigned in March 1961 to be succeeded by Don Revie. He never managed in league football again.

In her youth she was a competitive roller skater and ice skater, and later worked as an instructor teaching yoga and pilates. She trained as an ice dancer under James Millns and was in preparation for the Olympic trials when she required bunion surgery. Unable to skate due to the recovery period, she started dancing nude in order to support herself financially. She became an exotic dancer and won D√©j√† Vu Showgirl of the Year during her first year of dancing in 2004. Lane was invited to attend the AVN Awards ceremony in 2005 by Serenity, where at an after-show party hosted by Sean Michaels she encountered an agent from Playboy. She started to appear in adult movies in the same year. Her career is supported and managed by her parents, with whom she lives in an apartment. Lane credits her parents' participation in naturist recreation, and generalized \\"free thinking\\" and \\"open-minded\\" attitudes for their comfort with her involvement in the adult entertainment industry. She attributes the ease with which she was able to transition from ice skating to adult entertainment to the body image instilled by her own practice of naturism with her parents at home during her childhood. She appeared on the first episode of the Fox reality series My Bare Lady, which aired December 7, 2006, and on an episode of ABC Primetime: The Outsiders defending her career. Television audiences also saw her with her parents on Fox News' Geraldo at Large on March 18, 2007, using the alias, \\"Sunny Lee.\\" Lane was featured on the television show Pants-Off Dance-Off on Fuse TV. She has also worked at a Nevada brothel, the Moonlite BunnyRanch, at various times in her career. Her performance in the 2007 film Goo Girls 26 earned Lane the 2008 AVN award for Best POV Sex Scene.

The song is also the first Keane single to be sold in Mexico and other Latin American countries. The single was released to the iTunes Store on 16 May and to shops on 29 May 2006, and debuted at number 15 on the UK Singles Chart on 28 May based on download sales alone but reached number 3 with physical sales on 4 June. The song was officially premiered on 17 April on Jo Whiley's BBC Radio 1 show. Soon after this, it was leaked onto the Internet. The song was featured in the video games Madden NFL 07 and Dance Dance Revolution Universe 2. The song was nominated for the Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group With Vocal for the 2007 Grammy Awards. == Composition and recording == \\"Is It Any Wonder?\\" was composed by Tim Rice- Oxley in 2005, being first demoed the same year. The guitar effects originate from Tim's distorted Yamaha CP70 piano. An early demo appeared on the Under the Iron Sea DVD. It was mainly recorded at The Magic Shop studios, New York City and programmed and engineered by Andy Green. === Musical structure === \\"Is It Any Wonder?\\" was composed under an 8-beat 4/4 time signature and a 130 bpm tempo. The main key of the riff is A major, alternating to G major when the bass starts playing. The song starts with bashing piano notes, leading to Tim-Rice Oxley's deep distortion piano sound that is used to emulate abrasive electric guitar riffs. Bass guitar lines, synthesizers, and drums begin to finally introduce Tom Chaplin with the vocals of the first verse. Rice-Oxley continues to play regular and distortion piano notes throughout the verses of the song. As with almost all Keane songs, it includes a bridge after the second chorus, preceding the outro. Live performances show several differences from the studio version. Firstly, the deep sound is changed for the same synthesizer used for the whole song, which is also quite different from the one of the studio album. During the first verse of the original version, a synthesizer is used as a background for Chaplin's singing. However, on the live performance, Rice-Oxley keeps playing his distorted Yamaha CP70 piano throughout the song, instead of the synthesizer. Finally, drumming on the main riffs is modified, with Hughes beating the crash cymbal again and again. == Meaning == The song is about the Iraq War: == Music video == Directed by Kevin Godley, the video is almost the same throughout the song. A camera moves along a metal track like a roller coaster. The camera runs through rails until the end of it, stopping again. Keane are in the middle of it, with Tom appearing sometimes on the scene. On the making of the video, it is said by Richard that they \\"have done something not quite done before.\\" The CD+DVD edition of Under the Iron Sea includes a trailer for the making of the video, as well as the videoclip. == Cover art and packaging == The cover artwork for the single was designed by Sanna Annukka Smith, a Finnish artist in March 2006. Sanna originally wanted a red bird crying and Keane wanted a lonely soldier. During the first two weeks of April, the cover showed a soldier but the definite version shows the red bird crying on the soldier‚Äôs shoulder, with the soldier referring to war. Some versions didn't include the bird, like the first cover. The crying bird later appeared on the cover for \\"Try Again\\". Similar to the bookshaped box of the DVD for Under the Iron Sea, this biodegradable single's container is made of carbon neutral and recycled materials, without any plastics. == Track listing == == B-sides  Let It Slide === The Under the Iron Sea DVD includes bass recording sessions of this song. It was planned to be a track on the album, but became a B-side instead. It did appear on the Japanese version of Under the Iron Sea as the closing track. === He Used to Be a Lovely Boy === Following a melancholic ballad style, the song suggests a reference to Chaplin by Rice-Oxley. This acoustic song has been compared by fans to Keane's Christmas song \\"A Heart to Hold You\\", and B-side \\"The Way You Want It\\". == Charts and certifications  Weekly charts ===  !Chart (2006) !Peak position - ! scope=\\"row\\" Australia Digital Tracks (ARIA)  39 - - - - - - - - !scope=\\"row\\"Europe (Eurochart Hot 100) 7 - - - - - - - - - !scope=\\"row\\"Poland (LP3) 22 - - - - - - - - - - } === Year-end charts === style=\\"text- align:center\\" !Chart (2006) !Position - !scope=\\"row\\"Netherlands (Dutch Top 40) 29 - !scope=\\"row\\"Netherlands (Single Top 100) 70 - !scope=\\"row\\"UK Singles (Official Charts Company) 74 } === Certifications === ==References== ==External links== *Official site *Keaneshaped - Information about record *Keane.fr - Information about record in French Category:2006 singles Category:2006 songs Category:Keane (band) songs Category:Protest songs Category:Songs written by Tim Rice-Oxley Category:Songs written by Tom Chaplin Category:Songs written by Richard Hughes (musician) ","title":"Is It Any Wonder?"},{"id":"9116532","text":"Hans Theessink in Vienna, 2012. ..., performing in Konzerthaus, Vienna, in 2012\\\\.
